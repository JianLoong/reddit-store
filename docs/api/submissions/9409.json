That hurt your daughter greatly because, in the language of **actions**, what truly matters, it screamed \"You (daughter) aren't as close to me as you thought you were.\"\n\nSo your daughter is rightfully refusing to have your sister at her birthday party.

Tit-for-tat.  I hope your sister learns a lesson.", "NTA - your daughter was simply also having her party how she wanted.\n\nChild free weddings are fine to have but clearly your daughter was hurt by this, and she is allowed to be, and her feelings are valid. Your sister needs to recognize that her choice hurt your daughter.", "NTA. Your daughter is 16, not 4. Actions have consequences. She has every right to be hurt by not being invited to your sister\u2019s wedding. Your sister had the wedding she wanted and your daughter has the birthday party she wanted.", "NTA. And I don\u2019t blame your daughter.\n\nI think that I am biased though. Something similar happened to me, when my cousins and me. \n\nWe didn\u2019t find out about \u201cno kids invited\u201d until two months before the wedding. By then, the bride had said all of these things and allowed us (the teenagers) to tag along for her errands. \n\nOne of our relatives told the bride about our plans to shop for dresses for the wedding. So the bride spilled the beans. The backlash wasn\u2019t as ugly as one would think. But people (invited guests) were pissed because they had to make childcare arrangements. \n\nIt sucked even more because all of us teenage girls were stuck providing free babysitting services for the kids that came with their parents for the wedding.", "You're NTA. Eventually your sister will get over it.\n\nETA: hilarious that your sister thinks of herself as an adult and someone only 7 years younger is a child, yet now your sister is the one behaving as a petulant adolescent.", "NTA - well done on supporting your daughter in this. Your sister got to have the wedding she wanted, and that's great for her, but her choices have consequences and it's not up to you to protect her from them.", "NTA- tell your sister that your daughter wanted to have the party that she wanted, and that she didn\u2019t want anyone to \u201cgo wild.\u201d Also tell your sister that she\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA\n\nMost people don't consider \"childfree\" to include older teenagers and many families make an exception for certain other family members, at least for the ceremony itself. Unless your daughter is extremely immature, I don't understand not inviting her considering her age and their relationship.\n\nShe's certainly mature enough to decide who she does and doesn't want at her own birthday party anyway.", "NTA, if your Sister hurt your daughter, she should speak with her, and work it out.  I'm not sure which one is more childish", "NTA\n\nWell if it isn't the consequences of her actions!", "NTA she had her wedding how she wanted it, daughter had her party how she wanted it. That\u2019s not punishment - just the golden rule \u201ctreat other how you want to be treated\u201d", "NTA    It was your joint decision and that was a legitimate action on your parts.\n\nBut: much I think most adult-oriented events are inappropriate for children - who wants to be around the little bastards? - it seems that sixteen is beyond whatever the magic dividing line might be.   It's thus a bit surprising that your daughter was excluded from the wedding.  That was your sister's right, of course, but it strikes me as curious.", "NTA - are u supposed to force your daughter to invite her aunt. They can do 1v1.", "NTA. Your sister got the wedding she wanted, your daughter got the birthday party she wanted. Sister needs to learn that\u2019s how it works.", "NTA. Your daughter's birthday IS about her.

Your daughter had the party the way she wanted. I am sure your sister will get over it.\n\nAnd, yes, say her words back to her again and again.", "NTA\n\nIt's all \"it's my party I'll invite who I want to\" until you are the one being excluded.", "NTA!\n\nYour sister deserves this entirely.  Using her own logic, your sister got to have the wedding she wanted, and your daughter got to have the birthday party she wanted.  Seems fair, right?  Oh wait, maybe one should consider sharing special moment with the loved ones in their family?  Too bad your sister didn't think of this earlier.", "NTA.\n\nSo you happen to side with your daughter over your sister. What does she expect you to do? You don't think your daughter did anything wrong. Neither does your sister. The person who needs to speak to your daughter is your sister.", "NTA your sister made choices she totally could have said no kids under 15 or even no kids other than my #1 niece. It\u2019s her wedding her choice and she didn\u2019t choose your daughter so seems pretty fair that daughter reciprocated the sentiment.", "NTA. Your sister is a bit strange. IMO a no kids wedding means everyone under hs age, not the young adult set.", "NTA. Your sister made her decision, so your daughter made hers to.", "NTA and you sister should get it and if she doesn\u2019t she is being thick on purpose.", "You're NTA. Anyway it was your daughter's party and at 16 she is old enough to say who is, or is not invited to her party, so the issue is really mute. Your daughter isn't TA either. \n\nYour sister, she had every right to decide to have a child free wedding. By the same token your daughter has a right to feel slighted by that and to choose to not include your sister at her 16th birthday party. Either they are both being selfish (which I don't think they are) or they are both exercising reasonable control over what will make an important personal milestone most meaningful to them (which I feel is more the case.)", "NTA\n\nMost people who want childfree weddings don't want young children being disruptive. A 16 year old is not a \"disruptive child\" and if they were close, to be considered a \"child\" and excluded from the wedding would be INCREDIBLY hurtful. \n\nYour daughter has every right to be hurt and to not want her aunt at her party. If she's too much of a \"child\" to be at her aunts wedding, then her aunt should too much of an adult to pitch fits about not being invited to a \"child's\" party.", "NTA. And your poor daughter. My heart breaks for her. I hope she enjoyed her party!", "NAH:  They both did the same thing to each other. \n\nBut I'm curious it been 5 months you're the older sister and the mom.
