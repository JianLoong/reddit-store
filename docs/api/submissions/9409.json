So confusing when people think 16 year olds are children in a wedding capacity.  At least they can\u2019t even drink. Drunk 21 year olds are way more obstructive or loud than a 16 y/o sober girl who loves her aunt this much.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m all for respecting cf weddings. However, when I see any request for a celebration or ceremony to be child-free, I assume 12 and younger. \n\nDaughter was 15(?) when your sister got married. What was sister thinking her niece was going to do? Scream throughout and throw a toddler tantrum when she gets scolded for destroying the cake? Like, seriously, what was the cutoff for the wedding?

If so, then I can understand and lucky for the bride, she just made the cut.", "NTA. the best tit for tat imo would be your daughter not inviting your sister for her own wedding in future. show this thread to your sis so that she knows that she is  an AH.", "NTA \nYour sister sucks and how classless\u2026.I want to go wild at my wedding. Charming.", "NTA- See when I hear 'child free wedding' I think 'primary age'- any age where if they kick off or ruin special moments, or the cake, or the dress, you'll get \"But they're just a kid!\" if you get upset. I'd say 13-15 is 'if the parent trusts them not to be sneaking drinks and getting wasted' territory.", "NTA.  Your daughter had her birthday \"how she wanted it\". She wanted the freedom to enjoy her birthday. I'm sure your sister will eventually get over it.", "NTA.  Sadly, it appears that your sister\u2019s relationship with her niece has been damaged\u2014perhaps permanently.

But i hope your sister realizes she can kiss any relationship she had with your daughter away. And your daughter has every right to be upset at not being invited. I understand child free weddings.

And someday I hope your daughter has an aunt free wedding. Honestly 16 is  not what I think about at child free weddings.", "^ This. Your sister deliberately excluded your daughter from a milestone event. More than that, she built your daughter up for years and actively fed into her expectation that she would be included, even given a role of importance, in her wedding. Given the context, excluding her was just cruel. Undoubtedly, your daughter feels misled and rejected. Your sister has always maintained that she and your daughter are close, but she unceremoniously disposed of her just so she could \u201cgo wild.\u201d What does that even mean? Was she snorting coke off her husband on the dance floor and needed to protect your daughter\u2019s innocent eyes? Her reasoning is absurd, and at the very least shows seriously skewed priorities. Do that shit at the bachelorette party if you\u2019re that thirsty. In your daughter\u2019s position, I would seriously reevaluate my relationship with someone who treated me like that. Your sister only has herself to blame for the estrangement. Your daughter is not a prisoner to your sister\u2019s whims and unfair expectations, and you are not her jailer. Your sister is welcome to apologize and try to make amends, but I would advocate for my daughter and refuse to intercede on my sister\u2019s behalf.", "NTA.

Sister should talk to her directly rather than trying to get OP to intervene.", "RIGHT! 16 is not really a child. especially since theyre close, she couldve been an exception, she couldve been a jr bridesmaid\u2026 and sister wanted to be free and wild at her wedding, as if 16 year olds dont do the same? my friends were wilder w drinking drugs parties etc at 16 than at 23, 25 etc", "Op should try to see if they could help bridge the upset feeling between sister and daughter. Letting the resentments fester isn\u2019t really healthy for anyone and losing that relationship over something as forgivable as this would be a shame", "Is it possible it was a cost saving thing when they realized they could cut a bunch of guests by going child free? Sometimes the money you had planned doesn\u2019t go as far as you need it to", "16 is a child by literally every definition of what a child is. I have no idea where people get the idea that 'child-free' means 'child-free except for my super mature teenagers who are super mature I swear,' but a child-free wedding implies everyone is over 18 at least.\n\nLike if you went to a child-free resort and there were a bunch of 14-year-olds running around, you'd say that was false advertising.", "How does your sister feel? Does she talk to them?\n\nGood for your father for attempting to sway them in your favor.", "Decades ago my aunt had a child-free wedding. The only exceptions were her two nieces and her nephew, i.e. myself, 8, flower girl, my brother, 6, and my sister, 3. OP's sister could surely have made an exception for her then-15-year-old niece.", "I mean, what were you supposed to do, FORCE your daughter to invite her? Aunt should have discussed this with your daughter, not with you.

They are teens or adolescents. Minors if we are talking legally.  I teach child development at a university, which covers ages 0-13. Adolescent development covers 13-25. Calling teens children feels wrong to many people and teens aren't welcome in many child-focused spaces.", "15 IS hs age and therefore a young adult??", "I agree with sister's right to make whatever age cutoff she wanted. But she was so cavalier with her niece's feelings. She could have had her niece at the ceremony only, or at the ceremony and dinner only.
