Even a 10-year-old shouldn't have an issue getting through a wedding, let alone a 16-year-old.", "Canada and Australia are also big countries.\n\nBut I understand there was reasoning behind the US's policy, it wasn't just done out of temperance, fair enough.", "This. I feel like a wedding is about celebrating with your loved ones and if your loved ones include 5 year olds than that is what you get. It is not about the perfect ceremony, it is about sharing a special moment. But yeah, probably a cultural thing...", "huh you learn something new everyday. I figured it just had something to do with when US ended prohibition. As why bother changing/setting it beyond when you are having larger discussion about alcohol use.", "This. Also, the chance to \"go wild\" at her wedding? What the hell do y'all be doing at these weddings?! I know a lot of the traditions are dated and have been forgone, but drunk brides will always be trashy, sorry", "She was younger and didn't really care. She hated getting dressed up, so for her, it was OK. I think for me it was a combination of not being invited, being singled out because all my other cousins and my 2 older sisters were invited,  and everyone lying to me for months because I didn't find out until a week before when they finally had to tell me.  I think there also was a piece of me that was embarrassed at the time, although now I'm not sure why.  But seriously, who invites 2 of 4 sisters???  \n\nAs a funny side note, all of my friends know them as John and Sue, the cousins who didn't invite me to their wedding. It has turned into a joke because any time I mention them,  my friends go yes, the ones who didn't invite you to their wedding.   Lol.", "i laugh at the weirdest things... so i'd be half prone if there was a crying baby that couldn't be hushed, to go take them in my arms and bring them back to the altar with me (assuming that i succeeded in comforting them)\n\nmost people aren't wired that way and would want smaller children to be either someplace else, or at least have a nursery they could be taken to.\n\nmy only problem is with not paying the people who are doing the watching.  especially when its people who would want to attend the service.", "What you describe isn't even legal in many countries . Being an adult and being naked in front of a child is the kind of stuff that gets you on lists .", "Evidently, in nudist colonies in the US, it is perfectly legal.  I didn't know that either, but it is.  And nobody there was self-conscious about it at all.  Like I said, I was taken aback for about ten minutes and then I didn't even notice it after that.  We stood around talking just like any group of people would.  I was kind of jealous of how they were so happy and unembarrassed.  I did not see even one person looking at anyone else in any kind of sexual manner.", "I really don't get that mentality either. Those people always make me think of \"My Super Sweet Sixteen.\"", "That\u2019s awful. I assume neither of them ever apologized for excluding you and probably think the never did anything wrong.", "I\u2019ve been talking to my nephews on the phone for years. This year, the older one is 12 and is taking on scheduling his own zoom calls. I\u2019m gently coaching him on meeting scheduling etiquette lol\n\nNot talking to a 16 directly is really diminishing to her maturity and intelligence. Heck, it\u2019s really only ok to speak for very small children (even 2-3 year olds want to have a say!). \n\nI definitely solicit my 4 year old\u2019s thoughts on things, especially when it\u2019s something I know he\u2019s not going to like. I make the decisions but his opinion counts for a lot. Plus there\u2019s so many teaching and connection moments when he tells me what he\u2019s scared of or sad about. Toothbrushing is a cage match and underwear often pretend to be rocket ships, but going to school naked is Not A Choice and he knows it. \n\nI\u2019m just bummed this aunt horked it this badly.\n\nShe needs to apologize and ask forgiveness and start treating her niece like the almost grown up she is.", "No they just tried to justify it. Said they were paying themselves.  Blah blah. \n\nI think thevworsex was they invited my 2 older sisters but not my younger sister and me. Who does that? Invite half a family.", "NTA, absolutely. Also, 16 is a child???? I thought this applies to literal children that could spoil the wedding with screaming, running around and being bored. Your sister just sucks and is immature", "I find it odd too. Like even if she planned to \u201cgo wild\u201d, she could have invited the daughter to the wedding and possibly part of the reception, like the first hour or 2 or for the meal. And then made the rest of it 18+", "For sure. Sounds like you do a great job with your four year old so he feels his input is valid. 16 year old isn't in a position where she could comfortably talk to aunt about her feelings. If Aunt wants to preserve a close relationship she needs to step up to the plate and apologize. And actually listen to niece's feelings even if she doesn't think they are reasonable. Make the effort to understand niece's point of view.", "Yeah, no wonder you didn\u2019t let go of that grudge. No sincere apology? Then get fucked.", "Yeah, but I was the one with the problem all those years. Pissed me off that my family thought i should just let it go and be nice. \nWasn't happening.", "Yeah I don't understand why she'd prevent a 16-year-old unless she just wanted to be sure nobody underage could have alcohol... But even then it's actually not hard to prevent.", "I think there's a difference between child-free and minor free.  Your daughter would've been old enough to not be disruptive. Now, if your sister wanted to do things at the wedding or reception that no minor should witness, that's a different story. NTA. Your sister has to learn about consequences at some point.", "very nicely done", "I was lucky enough to see a pair of wild dik-diks a few years ago in Namibia. They are even more cute than in pictures!"]}
