Moreover I also gave her an extra present together with some closer friends. When the parcel of the Dutch oven, salt mill, and spatula arrived I went to pick it up, and to my surprise the big package did not contain the salt mill, therefore I called the company, filed a complaint and they proceeded to send me a new salt mill, which I received after a few days. \n\nToday I got a call from the parcel Center telling me that I have a parcel laying around for two weeks which they will return if I don\u2019t pick it up, when I arrived I noticed it was the missing salt mill, apparently the guy at the parcel Center made a mistake and did not give me the second package the first time I went to pick it up. I have two identical salt mills now! \n\nSince the salt mill is very nice I was very excited because I thought I could keep the spare one, and after all she already has a salt mill, and a pepper mill, so it would just be spare for her. \n\nI called her and told her so, she told me it\u2019s weird that I want to keep it for myself, because it\u2019s technically her present and that she should have it, and that I can make my own choice after all, she is not gonna ask me to give it to her.\n\nShe also \u201cmade a joke\u201d on how I should maybe sell it and give her the money or buy with the money something for her as a present. \n\nAITA for wanting to keep the item myself? \nWIBTA If I do?\n\nAnyway I already decided I won\u2019t keep it because I don\u2019t want to take something away from her, but I did not expect her reaction to be this! I am curious to see what you guys think!\n\nEdit:\n\nThe company that sent me the mill is a huge company, the order is in my name and delivered to my adress but the order was placed by a third friend that she took care of the purchase. we chose the items together with this third friend but since she lives in another country she got it shipped to me at my name. To return the item actually the third friend that lives abroad should do it. We could indeed return it, but at this point I give it to her, I don\u2019t want her to think I kept from her what she thinks it\u2019s rightfully hers.", "created_utc": 1684918810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qg5vb/wibta_for_keeping_one_double_item_i_got_by/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
