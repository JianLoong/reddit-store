It's been extra hard on her because she and my uncle were planning to have another kid, which now they can't do bc she needs chemo. My mom has also dealt with breasts cysts in the past, which weren't cancer, but her doctor said it was better to get them removed because they didn't look quite benign either.\n\nI (20F) found a weird lump in one of my breast last month and got really worried bc having close family members who've had cancer before rises your chances of getting cancer yourself. I went to get checked asap and my doctor told me there was indeed something there, but I would need to get an ultrasound *what* was there. Last thursday, I finally had my ultrasound appointment and the doctor told me that there's nothing that points to me having cancer, so I shouldn't worry about that.\n\nSunday it was my aunt's younger sister's birthday and there was a small house party for her (around 15 people, only family). All the adults there knew I had found a lump in my breast and I was worried. After dinner, one of my cousins asked me if I knew anything about it yet and I said that the doctor had just told me that it didn't appear to be cancer. She asked if I was feeling better now and I said that I was still a bit worried, but that I was just glad it wasn't cancer. My aunt Sofia heard this and got angry at me, saying she wished she could've said the same and that I didn't have to \"rub it in her face\". I told her that wasn't my intention at all and I was just answering my cousin's question, but she said that I was \"a selfish asshole\" (closest translation to what she said in my native language) for saying that knowing she was there anyway. I got angry bc she insulted me and said that I was sorry, but that I had every right to be glad for getting good news after a whole month of worrying nonstop and it's not like I had gone straight to her to show off bc I was just answering my cousin's question. After that, my aunt went upstairs and said she wouldn't come back down until I left, so my parents and I left like half an hour later.\n\nI was feeling very confident that I had done nothing wrong, but I just found out that my aunt Sofia didn't come back down to the party after I left bc she was crying, so I'm not so sure anymore :( AITA?", "created_utc": 1696331960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yp6nf/aita_for_saying_i_was_glad_i_didnt_have_cancer/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't say anything inappropriate. Your aunt's behavior is due to the very difficult thing she is going through, so let's not call her an AH either.", "NAH I think you didn\u2019t say anything wrong at all! I feel for your aunt because what she went through and still going through is such a big traumatic experience, I don\u2019t want to call her an AH because she\u2019s still going through it from what I understood. But maybe next time if someone brings it up just avoid talking about it in front of her.", "She overreacted and piled her anger and grief on top of an insensitive way to answer, but I feel like your reaction to her reaction was not it. It would\u2019ve been better just to say you\u2019re sorry with no anger or defensiveness. This was not an argument to try and win or be right about.\n\nIdk. Biggest AH here is cancer, so..", "Nta you were just telling your cousin how you felt I have sympathy for your aunt my little sister got cancer(cured btw) so Ik how it is you weren\u2019t rubbing it in tho", "NTA. You didn\u2019t intend to be hurtful. \n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a sensitive topic for her though, now you know for next time that she doesn\u2019t want cancer being talked about near her at all. \n\nI\u2019m happy for you that it wasn\u2019t cancer! \n\nI\u2019d just say sorry once more when you see her next, or call her. She could of been having a bad day that the conversation just sent her over, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019d appreciate another apology when she\u2019s less upset.", "NAH Of course, your aunt is emotionally very vulnerable. Who wouldn't be in her situation? She has to deal with cancer and surely it doesn't need a lot, to make her cry. Many patients get depression after diagnosed with cancer. She might ask, why she deserves that.\nLucky are those who don't have cancer. I think everybody can understand, that you are glad, you don't have it. And I'm sure nobody expects you to be sad about it or to wish you had cancer, too.\nYou can be the strong and reasonable person here: apologize that you made her sad, tell her that this was not your intention (no \"but ...\" it's not about you personally) and ask what you can do for her to help her in this hard time.", "NTA, what you said was fine, but your aunt is dealing with a lot right now, so she was slightly AH for coming at you. But she is also dealing with trauma and grief and most likely scared about her future. \n\nI'm glad you got the all-clear. I hope her treatments go well and she gets an all-clear too.", "NTA - You didn't mean your comment to anyone else but yourself.  And besides you were asked a straight forward question and answered it truthfully.  It's not like you showed up and got everyone's attention and made a major announcement to all.  Your aunt is sensitive and that is understandable.  I would visit your aunt and apologize (even if you don't feel you need to) and talk it over to clear the air, maybe over lunch?  Small price to pay to keep the relationship.", "uhhhh....... nah, you were both just going off a bit too strong with your own emotions, but also why would you say it like that in front of her lol??", "I'll grant you NTA to be relieved, but that wasn't the time or place for the remark.  Learn to read a room.  It's like celebrating a pregnancy in front of someone that just lost their child.", "ESH why would you ever talk about cancer Infront of a cancer patient other than if you have cancer.\nGreat that you don't but you could have answered in a way that wasn't \"I'm so glad I don't have cancer\".\n\n\"Yes I had my scan and there isn't anything there worth worrying about\"", "You\u2019re not an asshole but not very nice either. If you just said sorry for being insensitive in the moment, couldve spared making your aunt with cancer cry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You aren\u2019t rubbing it in her face anymore than any other healthy person she interacts with. She\u2019s angry and lashed out at you. You deserve an apology.", "NTA.\n\nDo you know what my loved ones who had cancer said when I found out I didn\u2019t have it? Thank God. They were so happy for me because they didn\u2019t want me to go through what they went through.\n\nWith that being said your aunt is dealing with loss and pain on a major scale. It\u2019s understandable that she doesn\u2019t have the ability right now to think about others. She\u2019s literally in survival mode.\n\nI hope this is something you both can move past. Your aunt likely realizes her emotions weren\u2019t really about you. Staying upstairs when she wasn\u2019t able to handle a party at the moment was likely the healthier choice for everyone.", "Nah I totally get her reaction and although it isn\u2019t nice, it sounds like it was an outburst because her life is getting turned upside down. Unless she has a history of this behaviour I would let it be.", "It was after dinner so I was sitting in the kitchen bar talking with my cousin and I didn't even consider the possibility of her hearing bc she wasn't right next to us :( It it's not like she was right in front of me bc she was a couple meters away in the main dining table", "What was insensitive about what she said?", "Why didn\u2019t you just say sorry for saying that around her and you didn\u2019t know she was there", "Saying you\u2019re glad you don\u2019t have cancer around somebody struggling with it is insensitive. Sensitivity is being mindful of what you say and do. Was she technically justified to say that? Sure, but if she cares about her aunt, which I think she does because she was concerned about her crying, the right thing to do would have been a simple sorry for her having to hear that.", "Saying that she was sorry for having to hear that, is totally different from saying you were insensitive. She was answering a question in a very obvious and normal way in a conversation her aunt wasn\u2019t even involved in. That\u2019s not being insensitive. I wouldn\u2019t apologize either after someone angrily called me names. Even cancer isn\u2019t an excuse to call someone names.", "Her initial comment was not inherently insensitive, it was if the aunt could hear. Which OP has already admitted to in the comments, she just didn\u2019t think aunt could hear.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between a random someone calling you a name vs your aunt who wanted a kid but now has to go through chemo feeling like you were being intentionally disrespectful", "NTA - but feeling really sorry for your aunt. I am not sure what you were meant to say. Cancer is not a good thing and it is a relief not to have it. Your Aunt Sophia's experience is enough to show that. \n\nBut she's really hurting at moment - her life is on hold, maybe permanently, until the cancer is beaten and she doesn't seem to be coping. I suspect your comment brought up why me, why am I being punished type feelings and she is in a very bad situation.\n\nMaybe reach out and ask how she is, not from the perspective of someone who is not enduring cancer but as a relative whose noticed she is having a very hard time.", "NTA\n\nJesus, if I had cancer and someone close to me had a cancer scare that was a false alarm, I'd be thrilled for them.", "YTA\n\nYou are in the same room as someone struggling with cancer, and that is the words you decided to put together and speak?\n\nYou have every right to be relieved about the lump in your breast being benign, but you couldn\u2019t say something like \u201cthe doctor told me I have nothing to worry about\u201d, or \u201ceverything\u2019s fine\u201d, and instead say \u201cI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have cancer\u201d when someone struggling with that exact cancer is \u201ca couple meters away\u201d?\n\nLet\u2019s face it, her \u201cselfish\u201d comment wasn\u2019t really an insult because you gave no thought to how you comment sounded to other people.", "NTA the AH here is cancer.", "NTA: No you were trying to hurt your aunt feeling. As a cancer survivor I am so very happy that you don't have cancer. Your aunt is hurting right now give her time cancer is the guilty party here.  In time reminder your aunt how much you love her. Cancer is so hard on your body and mental health. Stay well. Best wishes for you and your aunt.", "Nta", "NTA\nA decent person would have shared your relief", "NTA, you weren't trying to rub it in her or anyone's face. You just answered someone's question to you. Your aunt is just going through a lot right now.", "As a haver of cancer, I'm glad your results are clear! Good for you staying on top of it too, NAH! \n\nI understand your aunts reaction. It's part of the grieving process when given a shitty diagnosis. You've apologized and that's all you can do for now about that situation. Give her some time, her diagnosis is a very emotional and mental struggle. Be there as you can for her and her main carers. It'll be ok, she's angry at the world right now. Hugs.", "NAH and cancer really fucking sucks. I still can't fathom it. I'm so sorry y'all's family is going through the diagnosis and the scare. It's a heavy thing and it's being felt by everyone. I hope y'all can come out of this together", "NAH, you were just answering the question and being relived, but your aunt is really going through it. It's understandable she would snap when suddenly she has to think about all the bad stuff in her life.", "Exactly what I would have said.", "As someone who\u2019s currently in remission NAH too, like a close MAYBE on the wording and how OP said it. If someone close to me said that it might sting depending on how they said it but at the same time I\u2019d be like GOOD FUCK CANCER. Aunt is really dealing with some really harsh medicine that absolutely drains you emotionally, mentally, and physically. \n\nI remember lashing out at my mom after she picked up food that had 1000 island dressing on it, but the smell, look, and taste of it made me absolutely sick even wiping it off it still lingered. Did she deserve it, nope, but my food was so limited and dealing with treatment just broke me in the moment that everything i was staying \u201cstrong for\u201d came out.", "This was the experience I've seen as well. Mother died of metasised breast cancer and her two cousins had double mascetomy as carriers of a gene that increases liklihood. Talking about in a family with genetic disposition can be a literal life saver.", "Right. It's not like OP went up to her aunt showing her her test results saying \"nanny nanny boo boo I don't have cancer you do.\" It's normal to be relieved to not have cancer. The aunt flying off the handle is weird. Her response should have also been relief that her niece doesn't have cancer.", "Yet she wasn\u2019t disrespectful. There was no reason whatsoever to think that OP was trying to disrespect her. She just expressed her obvious relieve of not having cancer when asked by a family member about it. She explained to her aunt that it wasn\u2019t her intention to hurt her. Yet her aunt still saw reason to call her names. Going through chemo just isn\u2019t an excuse to mistreat others. Her aunt is going through a lot. Her family members should take that into account, but calling someone names because they express their relieve of not having cancer is not something she should have to excuse.", "The aunt called her an asshole and then went upstairs to cry the entire rest of the night. Was that mean? Yes. Is she going through an extremely complicated period emotionally? Also yes.", "I\u2019m not denying that. It\u2019s just not an excuse for mistreating others. It certainly doesn\u2019t make OP the one at fault or the one needing to apologize. She was nice when she told her aunt that she didn\u2019t want to hurt her. She only defended herself when her aunt started angrily calling her names."]}
