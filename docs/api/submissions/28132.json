It's been extra hard on her because she and my uncle were planning to have another kid, which now they can't do bc she needs chemo. My mom has also dealt with breasts cysts in the past, which weren't cancer, but her doctor said it was better to get them removed because they didn't look quite benign either.\n\nI (20F) found a weird lump in one of my breast last month and got really worried bc having close family members who've had cancer before rises your chances of getting cancer yourself. I went to get checked asap and my doctor told me there was indeed something there, but I would need to get an ultrasound *what* was there. Last thursday, I finally had my ultrasound appointment and the doctor told me that there's nothing that points to me having cancer, so I shouldn't worry about that.\n\nSunday it was my aunt's younger sister's birthday and there was a small house party for her (around 15 people, only family). All the adults there knew I had found a lump in my breast and I was worried. After dinner, one of my cousins asked me if I knew anything about it yet and I said that the doctor had just told me that it didn't appear to be cancer. She asked if I was feeling better now and I said that I was still a bit worried, but that I was just glad it wasn't cancer. My aunt Sofia heard this and got angry at me, saying she wished she could've said the same and that I didn't have to \"rub it in her face\". I told her that wasn't my intention at all and I was just answering my cousin's question, but she said that I was \"a selfish asshole\" (closest translation to what she said in my native language) for saying that knowing she was there anyway. I got angry bc she insulted me and said that I was sorry, but that I had every right to be glad for getting good news after a whole month of worrying nonstop and it's not like I had gone straight to her to show off bc I was just answering my cousin's question. After that, my aunt went upstairs and said she wouldn't come back down until I left, so my parents and I left like half an hour later.\n\nI was feeling very confident that I had done nothing wrong, but I just found out that my aunt Sofia didn't come back down to the party after I left bc she was crying, so I'm not so sure anymore :( AITA?", "created_utc": 1696331960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yp6nf/aita_for_saying_i_was_glad_i_didnt_have_cancer/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't say anything inappropriate. Your aunt's behavior is due to the very difficult thing she is going through, so let's not call her an AH either.", "NAH I think you didn\u2019t say anything wrong at all! I feel for your aunt because what she went through and still going through is such a big traumatic experience, I don\u2019t want to call her an AH because she\u2019s still going through it from what I understood. But maybe next time if someone brings it up just avoid talking about it in front of her.", "She overreacted and piled her anger and grief on top of an insensitive way to answer, but I feel like your reaction to her reaction was not it. It would\u2019ve been better just to say you\u2019re sorry with no anger or defensiveness. This was not an argument to try and win or be right about.\n\nIdk. Biggest AH here is cancer, so..", "Nta you were just telling your cousin how you felt I have sympathy for your aunt my little sister got cancer(cured btw) so Ik how it is you weren\u2019t rubbing it in tho", "NTA. You didn\u2019t intend to be hurtful. \n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a sensitive topic for her though, now you know for next time that she doesn\u2019t want cancer being talked about near her at all. \n\nI\u2019m happy for you that it wasn\u2019t cancer! \n\nI\u2019d just say sorry once more when you see her next, or call her. She could of been having a bad day that the conversation just sent her over, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019d appreciate another apology when she\u2019s less upset.", "NAH Of course, your aunt is emotionally very vulnerable. Who wouldn't be in her situation? She has to deal with cancer and surely it doesn't need a lot, to make her cry. Many patients get depression after diagnosed with cancer. She might ask, why she deserves that.\nLucky are those who don't have cancer. I think everybody can understand, that you are glad, you don't have it. And I'm sure nobody expects you to be sad about it or to wish you had cancer, too.\nYou can be the strong and reasonable person here: apologize that you made her sad, tell her that this was not your intention (no \"but ...\" it's not about you personally) and ask what you can do for her to help her in this hard time.", "NTA, what you said was fine, but your aunt is dealing with a lot right now, so she was slightly AH for coming at you. But she is also dealing with trauma and grief and most likely scared about her future. \n\nI'm glad you got the all-clear. I hope her treatments go well and she gets an all-clear too.", "NTA - You didn't mean your comment to anyone else but yourself.  And besides you were asked a straight forward question and answered it truthfully.  It's not like you showed up and got everyone's attention and made a major announcement to all.  Your aunt is sensitive and that is understandable.  I would visit your aunt and apologize (even if you don't feel you need to) and talk it over to clear the air, maybe over lunch?  Small price to pay to keep the relationship.", "uhhhh....... nah, you were both just going off a bit too strong with your own emotions, but also why would you say it like that in front of her lol??", "I'll grant you NTA to be relieved, but that wasn't the time or place for the remark.  Learn to read a room.  It's like celebrating a pregnancy in front of someone that just lost their child.", "ESH why would you ever talk about cancer Infront of a cancer patient other than if you have cancer.\nGreat that you don't but you could have answered in a way that wasn't \"I'm so glad I don't have cancer\".\n\n\"Yes I had my scan and there isn't anything there worth worrying about\"", "You\u2019re not an asshole but not very nice either. If you just said sorry for being insensitive in the moment, couldve spared making your aunt with cancer cry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You aren\u2019t rubbing it in her face anymore than any other healthy person she interacts with. She\u2019s angry and lashed out at you. You deserve an apology.", "NTA.\n\nDo you know what my loved ones who had cancer said when I found out I didn\u2019t have it? Thank God. They were so happy for me because they didn\u2019t want me to go through what they went through.\n\nWith that being said your aunt is dealing with loss and pain on a major scale. It\u2019s understandable that she doesn\u2019t have the ability right now to think about others. She\u2019s literally in survival mode.\n\nI hope this is something you both can move past. Your aunt likely realizes her emotions weren\u2019t really about you. Staying upstairs when she wasn\u2019t able to handle a party at the moment was likely the healthier choice for everyone.", "Nah I totally get her reaction and although it isn\u2019t nice, it sounds like it was an outburst because her life is getting turned upside down. Unless she has a history of this behaviour I would let it be.", "It was after dinner so I was sitting in the kitchen bar talking with my cousin and I didn't even consider the possibility of her hearing bc she wasn't right next to us :( It it's not like she was right in front of me bc she was a couple meters away in the main dining table", "What was insensitive about what she said?", "Why didn\u2019t you just say sorry for saying that around her and you didn\u2019t know she was there", "Saying you\u2019re glad you don\u2019t have cancer around somebody struggling with it is insensitive. Sensitivity is being mindful of what you say and do. Was she technically justified to say that? Sure, but if she cares about her aunt, which I think she does because she was concerned about her crying, the right thing to do would have been a simple sorry for her having to hear that.", "Saying that she was sorry for having to hear that, is totally different from saying you were insensitive. She was answering a question in a very obvious and normal way in a conversation her aunt wasn\u2019t even involved in. That\u2019s not being insensitive. I wouldn\u2019t apologize either after someone angrily called me names. Even cancer isn\u2019t an excuse to call someone names.", "Her initial comment was not inherently insensitive, it was if the aunt could hear. Which OP has already admitted to in the comments, she just didn\u2019t think aunt could hear.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between a random someone calling you a name vs your aunt who wanted a kid but now has to go through chemo feeling like you were being intentionally disrespectful"]}
