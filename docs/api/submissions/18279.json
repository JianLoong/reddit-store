I started crying, because everything that I had in the suitcase was ruined. My MIL started saying I was overreacting and I shouldn't have left my suitcase laying around like that. She said I was an AH because I blamed her for what happened.

After she gets you all that shit back, ban her from your house for destroying your things in the first place, so the new stuff is safe.", "NTA and I would say she is banned from the house and I would not go to any event that has her in it until such time is she pays to replace the suitcase and all of it's contents, and apologizes.", "Good grief! No one needs this aggravation. Does this woman live at your house? NTA.", "You didn\u2019t overreact at all, MIL is absolutely unhinged", "NTA and I don't understand how you are second guessing this. Your MIL sounds absolutely terrible.", "NTA. Your MIL engaged in criminal behavior, deliberately ruining an entire suitcase of clothing. Tell her she is not welcome in your home until SHE apologizes and pays you for the clothes she destroyed.", "NTA she didn\u2019t spill,spill means accident she poured coffee into your suitcase on purpose", "NTA she got herself kicked out", "NTA\n\nI'm glad your wife saw how wrong her mother is. I hope the two of you come to an agreement on how to manage the boundary-stomping, disrespectful, damaging harpy. Like she's banned from your house and your wife sees her (if at all) elsewhere so you don't have to interact with her ever again.", "There are times when pepper spray is the only action required.", "NTA. I really hope you have not \"started thinking\" that you overreacted and it was your fault that your MIL opened the suitcase and poured multiple cups of coffee into it", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmil invited herself along, complained about everything she could think of, tried to say you shouldn't go straight to sleep after arriving home at freaking 3am, and then punished you for not obeying her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou did NOTHING wrong, abso-freaking-lutely nothing wrong.\n\ndo not let this woman back into your home until she pays for everything she destroyed and apologizes", "NTA. Why would you ever think you were at fault?", "Holy crap no NTA, she did that on purpose.", "Nta but your monster in law certainly is. Trying to manufacture a situation in order to manipulate you is a no go SPECIALLY when she\u2019s trying to pull this trick in your own house. Tell the old bird to kick rocks", "NTA she\u2019s nuts", "NTA and if your wife is okay with it I'd keep her gone.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL intentionally opened your suitcase and poured coffee into it. That's crazy behavior.\n\nYou and your wife should cut her off.", "Nta, crazy that as a grown adult you needed permission from your mil to go to bed in your own home", "NTA - What kind of psycho behavior is going on here?! Has MIL acted like this before?", "I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. I don\u2019t know the full situation, but it kind of sounds like MIL shoehorns her way into you and your wife\u2019s lives a little more than she should. Of course, dealing with families can be tough, but you might need to start setting some boundaries with her. Best of luck to you and yours.", "NTA\n\nWelp, your MIL should come visit me sometime. I have at least 2 partially packed suitcases in my bed room most of the time. I travel a lot for work and sometimes leave on short notice. It's just easier to have some things already packed and ready to go.", "ah yes, the old \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you alert me of ____ when i\u2019m waiting here in surprise\u201d\nNTA", "If you think it was your fault then yes, you are the asshole", "NTA but your MIL is a weirdo and I wouldn\u2019t let her in my house.  I\u2019d also take her to small claims court for the contents of the suitcase.  SMH.", "I think your MIL is jealous and petty and a drama queen. you are definitely NTA", "I think it's possible MIL did something to the contents of the suitcase and had to cover it up. Maybe she was snooping and \"just\" couldn't get the contents packed back in correctly, or maybe she has done something (that I can't think of) that is more insidious?", "NTA. Your wife kicking her own mother out is a huge clue. If your wife can get the coffee stains out and you didn\u2019t have any electronics in the suitcase crying *might* have been a little much but you had just returned, late at night (or early morning depending on how you look at things) and were still probably tired which is why crying *might* be the only thing that was a but much. But certainly being mad as hell isn\u2019t an overreaction. Your MIL purposely dumped coffee in your suitcase to *teach you a lesson* about leaving it for later. You\u2019re a full grown adult living in your own home. Nobody outside if your home has a right to tell you how you should handle things like this. You definitely had every right to be so upset to kick your MIL out and since you didn\u2019t your wife did because it was the appropriate thing to do.", "You said the suitcase wasn't left like that and the cup of coffee =/ the coffee in the suitcase. What even made you think that you might be TA?", "This is a really weird story.  NTA\n\n>I had sent a message to my wife that my flight was delayed, but my MIL thought that I should have sent her a message aswell, even though I didn't know she would also be waiting for me.\n\nEven apart from the coffee issue - MIL sounds so unhinged.   I would stay far away", "NTA. Keep that unhinged MIL away for the forceable future.", "NTA but the hold your mil has over your house is really strange. \n\nWhy was she waiting up for you? \n\n\nHow does your suitcase remaining packed affect her?\n\n\nAnd why tf is she touching your stuff at all?\n\n\nI'm sure there's more bizarre enmeshment going on than you've written here, but you and wife should look into therapy. The way you doubt your (very reasonable and not incorrect) thinking after mil does something so shockingly unhinged is concerning. \nBecause your mil has no authority over you in your own home. You could leave your suitcase packed for a year and she would still be wrong for touching it. \n\nYou and your wife are adults who were mature enough to make the decision to get married, why do you need mils permission for anything? Cut those apron strings and get some space so you can see clearly.", "NTA. I had a roommate who \u201caccidentally\u201d spilled a full pot of tea on my mattress. I didn\u2019t buy that for a second and a few days later she broke down yelling about all the things she resented me for. \n\nSince you said your MIL isn\u2019t usually like this, is it possible she\u2019s having some kind of mental health crisis, or did she hit her head recently? \n\nAnyhow, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "It sounds from your post this is not typical and normal behavior from your MIL.  The way she reacted when you arrived home, the complaining and by her attempts to control you.   If this is true, your MIL needs to be evaluated by a doctor.  \n\nIf this is typical behavior, NC sounds about right.", "NTA. You needed her permission to go to sleep after a flight?.... You don't need that in your life.", "NTA.  Your home, your suitcase, your choice.  Questions: does MIL live with you? Why does your wife wait up for you to return from a trip? Why is MIL up with her until 3 p.m.? \n\nPlease don't tolerate obvious lying from anyone. So, next time you doubt your MIL's word, why wouldn't you think she lied - *again*.\n\nI hope this was a Friday or Sat night.  This all seems a bit weird.  Kicking MIL was the least you could do to stop the crazy-making MIL was creating in your home.", "I'm almost surprised MIL didn't hire an amputee with a fake arm that would fall off after tripping over the suitcase. \"AND THIS IS WHY YOU ALWAYS UNPACK BEFORE SLEEPING\"", "If OP and her wife have an apartment or a house together, I assume mil slept in a guest bedroom or possibly on the couch? \n\nEither way, that's irrelevant to the story. My way of thinking is the same as yours - if mil mentioned the suitcase, I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving it somewhere where she has access to it. But I realise that this way of thinking is due to my lack of stability growing up. And people shouldn't be afraid to leave something in their own home that's not bothering anyone because they're afraid that their guests would try to snoop or ruin the item. OP, your comfort in your own home is more important than your mils opinion.", "I leave my stuff by the door to keep from dragging any bugs in till I can clean it.", "Ditto", "Why was your MIL in your home at 3 AM waiting for you?", "Maybe she thinks you are cheating? I'm not saying you are, but maybe that's why she thought you took one more hour to get home? Or maybe its revenge for making her wait one extra hour? Anyway she sounds unhinged", "your MIL is fairly young, and to my understanding, she literally plays a role of a \"proper\" wife for you...She needs time out till she ages out to become \"the mother of the wife\", not her \"sister wife\". You need to let her know every single time she has any opinion \"my wife has got this, please MYOB\" and \"I will talk to my wife\" over and over again... you need to give her ample and loud and clear clues, that her opinion is noise ...right now you are hesitating and playing along...by the way, when you get kids, she will try to become the \"proper mother\" to your children.", "She wanted to punish you. Maybe for being late, maybe for not centering her in your unavoidable delay, maybe for some other reason. And then she wanted to pretend to be a victim about it.", "Do. Not. Calm. Things. Down. Please OP - this is abuse and MIL may have been abusing / manipulating your wife for so long and she doesn\u2019t realize it\n\nShe needs to be out of your lives ASAP. Not joking OP", "Why do you need to calm things down?", "Your MIL didn\u2019t want to calm down. Think about it- you left your suitcase up against a wall when you went to bed. IN THE MORNING is when this happened. I\u2019m not sure how long you were asleep for but I\u2019m guessing at least a few hours. Your MIL planned this for hours. Send her a bill ASAP", "OP send the bill. Do it for the clothes you lost. The toiletries and I would include the suitcase since you can\u2019t wash a suitcase and get the coffee out. \n\nI mean at minimum I\u2019m expecting if you have 2-3 outfits in there then it would be probably 200 for that (given you now have to buy replacements) depending on toiletries that could be less but if makeup was in there then that could be over 100 too. And the suitcase I would ask for the cost of the suitcase and if it is too low to replace then the cost of a comparable suitcase now.\n\nAt lowest we\u2019re talking 400-500 dollars at most reasonable I\u2019d call it 700-800 dollars. \n\nThings are expensive now and she doesn\u2019t get to just walk all over your budget by destroying your things.", "Other commenters are right here. You should not be trying to \u2018calm things down\u2019. That\u2019s what she wants: you putting in emotional effort to mollify her. This won\u2019t have been the first time you\u2019ve done it, that\u2019s why she believes she can get away with it. Don\u2019t over-react either by sending a bill immediately. \n\nSimply state that you both know the suitcase was not open when you went to bed and therefore her version of events cannot possibly have happened. If she\u2019s still at your house, tell her to leave and that she won\u2019t be allowed back again in the near future. Tell her you\u2019ll take the time to consider what reparations need to be made.  It will give you time to see what can be salvaged and tally up a bill. An apology acknowledging what she did should also be a requirement. You won\u2019t get either, but then you can say that until both are met, you won\u2019t be allowing her in your house again. \n\nIf your wife isn\u2019t on board with this, the. You have wife problems.", "Though I highly doubt you\u2019ll see a single penny from her, you should still send her the bill to set a boundary and show you won\u2019t brush her insane behavior under the rug anymore.", "Your MIL will never think things through because you or your wife speak to her the right way or make your case at the correct moment   Drama is her oxygen and she will do whatever it takes to be able to breathe it in. I also wonder if she isn't competing for your wife's attention and care. Because MIL is inserting herself into your wife's role as your partner and sabotaging those efforts to make it about her. For example, waiting up for you to return from the trip, insisting when and how you unpack, trying to keep you from going to bed, etc. Has she done other stuff like this before? If this is focused on your wife, she's got to be the one to starve her mom of her drama-oxygen. Oh, and NTA.", "She yelled at you for being late (at 3am)\n\nShe yelled at you for not unpacking your own suitcase, in your own home (at 3am)\n\nShe laid your suitcase on the floor, opened it up, and dumped coffee in it (while you were sleeping)\n\nShe blamed said coffee 'spill on you for not unpacking\n\nShe snapped at you for overreacting.\n\nThis is \"the sweetest person alive\" to you? Do you exclusively spend time around raccoons with rabies? She's an asshole", "Don't hold your breath for that one.\n\nWhat your MIL did was unhinged and if you let this go, things will get worse.\n\nSend her a bill for her malicious destruction of your items and refuse to engage with her until she pays. And even after she pays, enforce boundaries and go low or no contact until your and your wife's boundaries are respected.\n\nWhy the hell was your MIL even at your house to meet you after returning at night from a work trip??", "Who really cares. She is acting like a absolute horror of a human being if she is capable of this unhinged act. You need to put her in a time out.", "Your MIL's thinking is that she was slighted when you did not pay adequate attention to her and obey her orders, and she took vengeance.  You need to put up safeguards from now on.  She's shown you who she is.  Believe her.", "I agree it's abuse. Specifically, it's gaslighting.", "This all seems a little strange. Kicking MIL is the least you can do to stop MIL from creating madness in your home.", "Yes, she wanted to see what was in the suitcase. That is why she came in the first place. To snoop and control.", "Pretty sure OP was referring to her wife when she said \u201csweetest person alive\u201d.", "> up for her instead of making excuses for her mother!
