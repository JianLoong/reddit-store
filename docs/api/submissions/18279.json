The second I walk in, my MIL starts complaining about how I was supposed to arrive at 2am, how she has been up for one hour more than she thought she would, etc.. I had sent a message to my wife that my flight was delayed, but my MIL thought that I should have sent her a message aswell, even though I didn't know she would also be waiting for me. My wife calmed her mother down and I told them that I was going to sleep. That was apparently another thing for my MIL to start complaining. She thought that I needed to empty my suitcase before I go to sleep. My wife stood up for me and told her mother that I don't need to empty it right now and I can do it in the morning when I wake up. They argued for a little while, but finally I got my permission to go to sleep from my MIL. At this point I need to say that I left my suitcase closed and it was out of the way, standing near a wall. \nFast forward to next morning, when my wife and I woke up to a scream from my MIL. Both of us got straight up from bed and went to see what happened. My MIL stood horrified in the middle of our living room and she was looking at my suitcase, which now was laying open on the floor. My wife asked what happened and my MIL responded that she had \"accidentally\" spilled coffee in my suitcase, because I had left it laying open on the floor. My wife and I both knew she was lying, because I did not leave the suitcase like that. I looked at my suitcase and immediatelly realised that the amount of coffee in my suitcase didn't match the size of the cup my MIL was holding, because the cup was small and there were lots of coffee in the suitcase. I started crying, because everything that I had in the suitcase was ruined. My MIL started saying I was overreacting and I shouldn't have left my suitcase laying around like that. She said I was an AH because I blamed her for what happened. At this point my wife kicked her mother out and comforted me. \n\nNow that few days have passed, I have started thinking that maybe I overreacted and it really was my fault that my MIL spilled the coffee in the suitcase.
