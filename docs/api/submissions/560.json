I know my bio family well and don't see them regularly but do see them now and then. For me, my adoptive family is my family. They're my parents and siblings regardless of blood. They've been there through good and bad. But they're also secure in that knowledge that they're my family. Equally I want to know where I came from genetically. You can never have too many people that love you and that's a connection that can prove important for many reasons. Your mum is feeling threatened. You're NTA but you should talk to your mum and make sure she knows nothing will replace her but you need to have that connection with them too because whether she likes it or not, they're also your family.", "Info: is there some missing background? Why the change in her attitude?", "NTA \n\nUnfortunately for her you are adopted and biologically not hers. This doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t her daughter but imo this is something she should of came to terms with a while ago. I understand how this could hurt but this is not your fault and she shouldn\u2019t punish you by forcing you to somehow \u201cchoose\u201d. It isn\u2019t really healthy or fair.", "Info\n\nHow old are you?", "Honestly, reading all these posts about adopted children who are desperate to be with their bio families and adoptive parents that are owed nothing makes me think that adoption is not worth it. It's nobody's fault, but it's working like it's supposed to. Foster parenting sounds better, if you want to help kids in need.", "NTA, but I warn you adopted people who post to AITA often get terrible responses that make it clear many of the commenters should never adopt. \n\nThose commenters seem to think that adopted children should be *grateful* to their adoptive parents, that said parents are *entitled* to being loved the most and banning any contact with the bio relatives if they so choose, and the adopted child is being come combo of disrespectful, selfish, stupid, and malicious for not appreciating the massive act of *charity* their parent did by adopting them.\n\nThey are wrong.\n\nAdopted children do not *owe* their parents any more than biological children do. For both scenarios the adults made the choices leading to becoming parents. They signed up for it. And when you sign up to be an adoptive parent, you are also signing up for a child with biological relatives they may some day become close to, and even want to live with, have significant roles in life events like weddings, and be called 'mum' or 'dad'. That is something you choose to take on when you adopt a child.\n\nAnyone calling you the A but basing it on the fact you are adopted should be dismissed, and they should question why they hold adopted children to different standards and expectations.\n\nAnd personally if the reason your adoptive mother is giving is that \"you aren't related to them anymore\" that makes me think she is just being selfish and jealous. That she wants to pretend you are her bio child and force you to also live that fantasy without your consent.", "**NTA**\n\nMany adoptive parents get concerned when their children begin to learn about and form connections with their biological family.  Some  is concern that their children will ultimately be hurt.  Others they will lose their child in some emotional way.  Others may have a lingering opinion on the unknown reasons a child would be put up for adoption.\n\nMy best recommendation is to work to blend the two sides of your \"family\".  Talk to your adoptive mom to understand *her* side of things and assure her that you do, and always will, love her as your mom.  If she's not met your biological family, make arrangements that she does so.  If there are events, for either family, make everyone welcome and included.  For example, if she's excluded from bio-family events ... insist that she be included.\n\nYou don't indicate your age (so assuming a minor) but respect your adoptive mom's viewpoints while gently working with her to address them.", "NTA, it's natural for some adoptees to want closer ties to their biological families, your mother  is not a bad person , I think she just feels threatened", "NTA.  I am not sure what the laws are regarding adoption everywhere.  I can only comment on the laws in the state in the US I live in.  \n\nMy husband and I had to get our foster license before we could start the adoption process.  This included months of weekly classes that addressed these kind of situations.  It meant that we had to really think about the issues that come with adopting a child.\n\nWe decided thar we wanted an open adoption so our son could know his biological background.  We also wanted him to know that the choice his biofamily made was out of love.  He was not \"given away\".  He was place with a loving family who wanted him so bad.\n\nWe knew that there is a chance he could turn his back on us when he is an adult and choose his biofamily.  But really kids go no contact with the people who raised them all the time.  Our child, bio or otherwise, owe us nothing.  They don't owe us holidays, grandchildren, or making we are taken care of when we are too old to take care of ourselves.  All we can do is provide love and support.  We all hope our children love us and want to be with us when they are adults.\n\nAdoptive mom really needs to get past her fear.  Her daughter is in a situation only other adoptees can truly understand.  When my son is 16 he can see his birth family.  However, because he is still a minor, it would be with me.  Once he is 18 he is free to make his own choices.  I just hope his choice is that no matter what, he knows that I love him more than I love myself.", "NTA your adopted mom is likely jealous and insecure. She worries she will lose you to your biological family. It is NOT your responsibility to deal with her feelings. She should have known when she adopted you that you may one day want to be connected to your family. \n\nI am not my son's biological (legal guardian.) I am not biologically related to him in any way. I have raised him since birth. I'm his mama. He is allowed to talk to his mom whenever he wants, and she agrees.

If so then remind her now and again how important she is to you.\n\nOf course she is right on one point, you are legally no longer related to your bio family.

They sometimes see their relatives, especially the ones who weren't involved in the way their parents behaved, and one of them has made up with their birth father and visits him sometimes. He was also wise enough to recognize my place in his kid's life, and vice versa -- the best thing kids can have is a multitude of loving, decent adults who care about them and want to help them. \n\nI've always tried to surround my kids -- all of them -- with a crowd of parental figures. Both their father and I have remarried, and their stepparents are actively involved in their lives as parent figures... but so is my brother, who lives with us, and so is their father's best friend, who lives with him and his wife, and there are a scattering of others besides, who don't live with us but whom we see often. There were even more when the kids were little and we lived in a polycule. \n\nI actually had to teach my children, before they entered kindergarten, that most people only had two parents (or, at most, two separate homes and two parents in each home). They were *shocked!!!* \"How do they ever *play?*\" they wanted to know. \"You don't have enough time to play with us half the time, and there are five of you. Those poor kids!\" \n\nI had to admit that they were right... parents in nuclear families often *don't* have enough time to play with their kids very often, especially on work days. We were fortunate in that most of the time, there was at least one of us who wasn't too busy to play with our toddlers, even if it took them a bit to find out which one had time at the moment. Their point stuck with me, though, and even when I shifted to living with only one partner for a while, I made sure to bring as many other adults into my kids' lives as I could. I wanted them always to be able to find a grown-up who wasn't too busy for them.\n\nOP, you're not doing anything wrong in wanting to see your birth relatives, so long as they aren't dangerous -- the more people you can get who are decent and love you, the better. But I doubt you can do so at 16 without your parents' permission. You may have to sit them down and try to allay their fears in order to get that permission. I hope you can. If not, when you're 18 you can go wherever you like, but I don't blame you for not wanting to wait two years.", "So over the past year you have grown to like the bio family?

That its cold, dirty, hungry, abused children begging for money on the streets and then some saintly person comes along and gives the child the grace of adopting them, despite the sacrifice of time and money it will be to the angelic adoptive parent.\n\nTherefore anything the adoptive parent does for their child is out of the goodness of their heart and an act of selfless charity to the poor child, and the child has no right to expect to be raised well, as opposed to biological parents who are obligated to do those things.\n\nExcept that's not how it works. Generally adoptive parents really really want children and jump through so many hoops and do so much work to 'pass the test' and be considered suitable to adopt.

Because the op clearly doesn't consider the feelings of her adopted mom in this scenario. The op stated that they have been feeling more curious in knowing their biological family which is just saying that they're now feeling more connected to them which is normal, but the way they're going about it is obviously the problem here because the AM has been more understanding of her curiosity in the past.\nWhy did the AM's suddenly stop them from going visiting their biological family?\nThere's definitely more important information in this situation the op is leaving out.", "Stop making excuses for your AH adoptive mom. Start telling your bio dad the truth.", "I feel there's a lack of communication with you and your AM. You're the child here so suggesting joint therapy with her might be weird but that would be the best realistic solution to this issue imo so as to not burn bridges with her or your biological family.", "She's right to feel jealous that the person she cartered for for 16 years is now feeling more connected to the people who abandoned her at birth just because of the 'blood connection'.\nA biological child is meant to be more loyal to their biological parents (who have been great to them throughout their lives) than that of their godfathers (etc). Why shouldn't an adopted child be held to the same standard?\nIts actually you people that are enabling wicked adoptive parents because they see that people like you can never see adoptive children as their true children no matter what.", "They did not abuse her, they gave her up for adoption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: OP - the kid - is fine to make her own decissions, and to love and have the relationship SHE choses with all parents and relatives, adopted or otherwise. She is NOT her adopted mom's property.", "And people will be like \"oh so you think a kid should be an orphan instead???\" When that's not what people like us are arguing for. We just want more ethical adoptions.", "You're missing the point here. The person I replied to didn't mention therapy as a solution to the current situation but as a means to say that the AM is a broken human.", "OP states in the post the reason her adoptive mum is giving is that OP isn't related to her bio relatives. Which I would categorise under \"awful\" and \"Adoptive parent wants to pretend they are the bio parent and force their child to also live that fantasy whether they want to or not, which is selfish and a denial of reality\".\n\nWe also have this from OPs comments:\n\n*Yes I liked them more as I grew, My bio fam always adored me since I was young, I was uncomfortable at first but I realised I was getting closer to them ( not as close as a family would be tho) , maybe my adoptive mom realised I was starting to get closer to my fam which made her dislike me going to my bio fam's event etc. It's been more than a year not seeing them tho :(*\n\nIts \"children don't owe their parents for raising them\", not \"children don't owe their parents for raising them, unless they are adopted, then they totally do\".", "She is a major AH, and hurting the kid she pretents to love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Why shouldn't an adopted child be held to the same standard?\" . The kid should not be held to any standards. Thekid should be free to make her decissions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdoptivr mom is a major AH for making this about herself when it should be about her kid. AHs like this then wonder when their kids don't visit when they are old enough to leave.", "I mean I want to try and adopt one day, though its looking increasingly unlikely because I would want to own at least a 2 bed flat first and the property market is insane.\n\nBut I'm well aware that its about me wanting to adopt, the child wouldn't owe me, and when you sign up to adopt you are signing up for a child with biological relatives and that its possible in the future the child may love them more or even cut you out of their life.\n\nThe thing is, I don't see how that is any different from biological children. When you choose to have a biological child or adopted child, you are signing up to infinite potential. This includes signing up for a sick child, a mentally ill child, an autistic child, a disabled child, a child who hates sports, an introverted child, a gay child, a trans child, a child with acne, a child with bad grades, a child who wants to study something you don't like at university, a child who doesn't want to go to university at all, and yes, a child who may some day find other people they like more and even cut you out in their favour.\n\nThing is, though all of that, if you decide to have a child you owe it the them to raise them well, and they owe you nothing in return. Anyone who doesn't get that shouldnt have them.\n\n(Note, there was a post, might have originally been on tumblr, to this effect which is what got it to click for me but I can't find it to link it. I don't think it expanded to say its also true for adopted children though).", ">The person I replied to didn't mention therapy as a solution to the current situation but as a means to say that the AM is a broken human.\n\nUnless you're the person who wrote the comment, I don't think you can know that. I read the comment as a suggestion to get therapy, because her behaviour is negatively impacting her child. There was no \"broken human\" commentary.", "The crazy part is that op stated her adopted mom and bio dad are cousins.", ">OP states in the post the reason her adoptive mum is giving is that OP isn't related to her bio relatives. Which I would categorise under \"awful\" and \"Adoptive parent wants to pretend they are the bio parent and force their child to also live that fantasy whether they want to or not, which is selfish and a denial of reality\".\n\nI disagree categorising that comment as 'adoptive parents wants to pretend they're the bio parent and force child etc...'\nThe op must have acted in a way which made the AM feel betrayed despite all her efforts which is why she made that comment.\nAnd if you want to sit here and act like someone who has been there for you for 16 good years, being a vital pivot in your growth from birth, shouldn't be considered more as a parent than someone that abandoned you when you were BORN then I'm done conversing with you.", "'A kid should not be held to any standard'. Lmaoo. Ok, we're done.", "Suggesting that it's only the AM that needs therapy in this situation is exactly what I'm talking about.", "And there it is. The child owes the adoptive parent for raising them.", "That doesn't mean she's being called a broken human! The AM does clearly does need therapy.", "If that's what you got from everything I typed, respectfully, you're dumb.\n\nA friend that's been with you through thick and thin is more of a family than your biological family who neglected you at birth. Same thing with adoptive parents. That's the point I was trying to make and I'm not explaining it again."]}
