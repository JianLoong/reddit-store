The person she bullied has also missed lifetime events - having a trauma free school life for one.  That trumps going to prom or homecoming for me.\n\nLet her back up the photos before deleting the social media accounts though.", "NTA.\nThe fact that the poor kid moved schools, and the fact that race was part of this tormenting? \n\nSeems pretty fair to me.\nThe one thing you missed........\n\n I'd also make sure the other parents of this group know.  You'll soon find out which parent allows this sort of thing.", "NTA: this seems appropriate to the level of offense here, especially the deletion of social media accounts.\n\nThat said, there's a chance to teach the idea of repentance and redemption. Assuming you are in the US or Canada (I don't think homecoming is a thing elsewhere so I feel good about that assumption), the school year is just about to start and prom isn't until late April/early May. Create a plan of restorative actions she can take to earn back prom. These actions can include volunteer service, ~~befriending someone who is an outcast at her school~~, cultural sensitivity classes, and (if possible) something that can positively impact the girl she bullied.\n\nAlso, giving her something to earn back like that let's her have a positive focus for the year. What she did was very wrong, and needs to have consequences, but it can be an important learning opportunity too.  Good luck.\n\nEdit, some great conversation here. I crossed out the idea of befriending an outcast, and I agree that the pics should probably be saved, but maybe not ones with the other friends involved.\n\nI can also very easily detect those who have zero parenting experience and those who will probably end up LC or NC with their children someday because they have no feel for the idea of repentance and redemption. It's a balance, people. Raising a teen means there have to be serious consequences for serious actions, but also teaching them how to behave in the right way, and that requires a path for earning back what they have lost.", "NTA and good for you for coming down hard on this, though I would maybe let her save the photos to a physical drive somewhere before she deleted the account.", "NTA.\n\nVictim of racist bullying here. That trauma follows you for the rest of your life and getting proper help is hard as even in large cities, it can be difficult to find a therapist that specialises in racial trauma, especially a none white therapist.\n\nParenting isn\u2019t always fun but your job is to raise a decent human that can contribute positively to this world. Sounds like you\u2019re doing your job. I wish more parents take note!", "Nta... I'd be making her use her socials to repent for her actions. \n\nTaking shit away doesn't really teach her anything. Already she's more focused on bargaining down instead of focusing that she forced a person to change schools to escape her toxicity.", "Nta. But save the pictures to a USB before deleting everything", "NTA\n\nAs a bullying victim myself, thank you for teaching her that there are consequences for such horrid behaviour.", " NTA. That\u2019s great parenting. When she gets in the real world the consequences can and will be more severe.", "NTA\n\nI honestly think it fits the crime.\n\nI'd just let her backup the photos from her insta, before forcing her to delete it. Btw, you do know that she can just create a new account, so her deleting it does nothing.", "NTA.  The lesson from this punishment will stick with her for a long time, just like the trauma of bullying sticks with its victims for a long time.  You absolutely are in the right here.   I didn\u2019t go to my prom and I turned out fine.  She\u2019ll survive and maybe remember this lesson.", "Prom isn't a right, it's a privilege.  She lost that privilege.

Racial bullying in and of itself needs severe consequences because it's never ever acceptable but the fact that this went on to the point the kid had to leave - woah no this needs some serious consequences.\n\nYou're doing the difficult bit of parenting here and I think you're doing it really well.  Putting her through these things is going to be rough for you as you're going to have to deal with her reaction and also her disappointment (which is never nice as a parent even if it is a just consequence as we don't want to see our kids upset ) but you're doing what needs to be done to teach her vital life lessons and hopefully helping her to move into adulthood as a kinder, more tolerant and respectful person. \n\nWell done - it's hard, it's horrible and it's shocking to find out your kid did that, but you're dealing with it well.", "Info: How long had it been going on before the girl moved schools and how come you only just found out? What are the other parents saying/ doing?", "Actions have consequences. That poor bulled student probably is now going to enjoy a prom.   NTA.", "What if you gave the the possibility of earning things back?\n\nThe point of punishing her is for her to learn from this.  To become a better person.  Often the best impetus for change is when people see you change and reward you for it.\n\nSo tell her that homecoming is gone, but if she genuinely learns from this and shows that she is a better person, she might be able to earn senior prom.  She\u2019s got to show real change and understanding.  She\u2019s got to do something that will really drive home for her how much harm she has done and how wrong her actions have been.  The person she is today?  That person doesn\u2019t go to prom.  But a kinder person, who chooses to be a force for good in the world?  A person who helps and supports instead of tearing down?  That girl could go to prom.  She just has to make a plan with you about how she demonstrates that she is that person.  The right kind of volunteering, like homeless outreach or big brothers/big sisters, might help break down her walls and start seeing people as people instead of things to manipulate again.  Might teach her some empathy.  If it\u2019s affordable for you, working with a therapist who specializes in bullying, both to counsel her and to build her road map to redemption, would be an excellent idea.\n\nLet her download her Instagram pics before you make her delete the account - there)s a balance to that.  She doesn\u2019t have to give up her only copy of important pics, but she loses the online presence.\n\nNTA, but I think there are more effective things you can do than creating this big punishment that you can\u2019t back down from.", "NTA. \n\n\"Yesterday I was informed that my daughter Sam was a part of a group of students who bullied another girl to the point that she had to switch schools. \"\n\nJust LET my daughter get caught doing shit like that...\n\nIf anything, your punishment is rather lenient.", "NTA. The punishment fits the crime. This girl had to uproot her life. What will her prom mean to her, in a school where she barely knows anybody? \n\nAnd if you go back on it now, what will your daughter learn from this? That tantrums and crying mean she gets her own way.\n\nNow that you've set out the punishment you absolutely have to follow it through. Otherwise you'll be teaching her a lesson, but not a good one", "NTA the girl who had to switch schools will not be attending that prom will she? \nNow your daughter can have a once in a lifetime lesson. \nShe won\u2019t bully again !

But now, after you sauf what you said, you should not row back.\n\nBullying is serious and there can be no reward for begging.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too harsh. I was her age not too long ago and it\u2019s crazy to me to be bullying people at that age. This probably wasn\u2019t her first time being a nasty person either. She\u2019s going to be 18 soon and it\u2019s best to nip this as soon as and as best as you can otherwise she won\u2019t learn her lesson. This might be the wake up call she needs. Otherwise she could potentially end up like one of those racist young women that were recently on the news for yelling slurs and punching an Asian family because they thought they could get it away with it. Now they\u2019re in jail.", "NTA. Bullying is a major issue, it needs a major punishment.", "NTA.. Do the crime, do the time.", "NTA. She deserves it.", "NTA. What about that girls once in a lifetime homecoming and senior prom? Alot of things are once in a lifetime, that\u2019s why they are good for punishment. She basically made another persons life hell, she deserves all those punishments.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA. I\u2019d like to suggest trying to find a way for your daughter to write a letter of apology. A sincere apology, not just a note written in hopes of retrieving her losses. Not via social media or email  - a handwritten letter. Her school maybe able to a facilitate non-contact letter/card. \n\nPerhaps offer her a chance for Prom, if she writes a local or school newspaper article about how bad bullying is. \n\nCarry-on, Dad. You\u2019re doing great. Teens screw-up in ways we didn\u2019t, because of different avenues we didn\u2019t have.", "NTA what if the student killed herself as a result of the bullying ?

Sit down with your daughter and show her what can actually happen.", "Nta. I would allow her to download photos before deleting social media, as photos are precious. I would also suggest pushing towards making ammends more than just punishment, so apologising sincerely to the bullied student, volunteering somewhere to help others, especially if there's anywhere near you that has a youth club, she could volunteer at, volunteer with an anti-bullying charity, ask about doing an assembly at school, and your daughter, and the other bullies, should give a presentation about the dangers of bullying, and ways to help students who you fear are being bullied. Then possibly depending on how well she responds to the volunteering, allow her to attend 1 event, as long as she keeps up with making ammends for her bullying.", "NTA but let her keep the Instagram or at least download the photos first. She shouldn't have to lose out on those memories because of a punishment.", "NTA.\n\nIf she was bullying another girl to the point where her victim switched schools, she's inflicted massive damage on that poor girl's life, damage that may take years to heal, if it ever does. She deserves to find out what it means to miss out on \"once in a lifetime\" events, have her final year of high school wrecked, and to lose her precious photos.\n\nActions have consequences. Extremely harmful actions should have extremely harsh consequences.", "NTA.\n\nWhat about the person she bullied ? Didn't they miss anything from all the bullying ?\n\nShe's almost 18, not a kid. She absolutely deserves to miss those events for bullying a student so badly they changed school. \n\nI'd argue you should also use this as an opportunity to teach what racism does to people. What opportunity she has that other people won't get because their race is different. \n\nYou did good, but you could do more to ensure she actually understands the weight of what she did. \n\nThough, at almost 18, she should already know better.", "NTA. When our children fall below expectations it's our responsibility to hold them accountable.  \nThat poor girl who had to move schools has had her secondary school life traumatised, why on earth should your daughter come away unscathed?\nHave her download the pictures from the account, the rest of the punishments are entirely reasonable.", "NTA\n\nI would recommend transferring the pictures from her social media to a flashdrive, though. Then give her the flashdrive when she shapes up.", "NTA, if the poor girl had to move schools it must have been pretty serious. People take their lives over this sort of treatment. I agree taking privileges away is a good idea but possibly with the option to earn them back. Not through jobs but through understanding. I wonder if there is a program to help the less fortunate or some sort of buddy system or something that would help her understand how other people feel.", "NTA. I know of a few kids that were bullied in school so badly it led to self-harm and suicide. It's incredibly serious. Grandparents often have a blindspot when it comes to their grandchildren, obviously, who wouldn't? But you're doing the right thing imo. Back up her photos and memories, you can even download social media data in some cases, and then lock her down. I guess talk to parents and explain stamping out bigotry and hatred is far more important than a prom. I doubt the bullied child would be going to that prom if they hadn't already moved schools.", "NTA\n\nBut I'd like to know what it was that she and the group did and do the other parents know what happened and what's the consequence for their kids?\n\nIs she remorseful for her actions and what is she doing to give some restitution to the kid that was bullied.  At minimum that kid needs an apology and it may need to be written.. but it's up to the other kid as to whether they accept it or not.\n\nWhat you have to mindful of is that the punishment isn't just punitive that just makes her worse and ruins her relationship with you altogether.\n\nAs the bullying was racist, is there something she can do with the community that this other kid has a heritage with ie it might be volunteering at an organisation specific to that culture.\n\nIs your daughter really racist, or was she just following the crowd... that's a conversation in itself.\n\nAre there any legal ramifications for your daughter should the other family pursue it?  That's a harsh lesson for her.\n\nI'd probably look at compromises in regards to some of the activities she's going to miss.  Homecoming... too bad - doesn't deserve this.  Senior prom - this one I would look at compromises that might involve a chaperone and no hanging out with friends following the prom (and really the people she'd likely want to hand with might be the fellow bullies so I wouldn't want them hanging with them anyway).  Social media - see if she can preserve the photos.. then you can delete.  But you'll find that she'll just get a new account and when she's 18 she will anyway... she'll be not far off this.  Car... not deserved.  She should be working to pay for this herself.\n\nFrom the OP, the things that will hit her hardest will be prom and the photos.. it's like she's conceded the other things because she knows it's bad and she doesn't deserve them.\n\nWill the kid bullied that left be able to participate in the new schools prom and homecoming?", "You should have allowed her to download the photos first but otherwise you are letting her off easy", "Just be careful not to make your daughter become even more racist by her blaming the victim.", "NTA, \n\nwas the school notified of the bullying? why has there been no action against your racist bully daughter and her friends? They should have been expelled, to begin with, the reason going o their records. \n\nSecondly Completely justified punishments. From the history of your posts seems like your daughter is the entitled one and your wife tends to give into her demands. Like her wanting you to cancel your son's school Disney trip and your wife asking you to seriously consider it just because she couldn't go due to the pandemic. \n\nAnd absolutely make her drop those friends. They are either bad influences on each other or just multiplying their terror by being together.\n\nI would also recommend cutting her allowance completely for the summer/coming months and making her give it to her victim along with a sincerely written apology as to what she did and why was it wrong.", "NTA its clear she arent grasping the severity of the situation. Bullying can lead to suicide. This girl is gonna pay her whole life for your daughter's actions and may end up in a bad way. Once bullied its like bullies can sense it and target you, and even if not the emotional trauma is intense.   \nEveryone made some very good points and ideas as to how to expand the punishment to something teachable, and I fully support this", "I suspect this post is for Karma points (themes and the way it is written), but to humor the OP:\n\nThere are many ways to make this a teachable moment for her as well enact some kind of punishment rolled up in one that would be far more effective than what you propose.  What you propose in your post are options of all negative consequences which seems solely out of anger.  Even your own parents are disagreeing with you.  And if you go through with it with only a POV of anger, then that is what you will teach your kid to treat others as well.\n\nWhat would be better would be a suspension of privileges, maybe even delete some accounts (ONLY after saving the important pictures), and then more importantly doing things to learn why this was so bad.  You can be creative or mundane in formulating the teaching opportunities.  Things that might be helpful to teach EMPATHY and UNDERSTANDING would be:\n\nWatch videos and/or take classes on bullying.  Maybe you should attend them with her so you can discuss what was taught.\n\nGo volunteer or work for an non-profit that tries to help others less fortunate.   You can figure out the ones that exist in your local area that make the best fit for the circumstances.  IMO, serving others is one of THE most effective ways to teach people.\n\nWrite a long essay about her behavior for self reflection and improvement.\n\nIf the school offer a an anti-bullying club, have her join.\n\nHave her see a counselor/therapist.\n\n(And TBH, I have to question you as a \"father\", going on Reddit where all your posts seem like you are complaining about your daughter, there is certain irony here with use of SM. )", "NTA racist bullying till the kid changed schools... and I bet her social media is where more happened...  tell her to download the pics while you sit with her and then delete IG too", "NTA.\n\nYep, when you traumatize someone to the point they transfer schools and you are a racist?!

However,, I do think that bullying is unacceptable and racism is unacceptable. I fundamentally disagree with punishment based parenting, and I think that parents should parent their children by teaching them that actions have consequences instead of just simply punishing them. But that\u2019s just my personal opinion. I think that this child should be able to keep her Instagram account for the photos but if she wants to text friends, she has to have an adult beside her at all times. If this daughter hasn\u2019t apologized to the girl or even attempted to rectify things with the girl. She should do that as a way of you know making the situation, right. If she apologizes to the girl and the girl forgives her and she excepts the apology from the daughter, then I think that any punishment afterword is completely useless.

But I would hope an adult would call their ass out\n\nI didn't \"betray\" anything (I think you meant portray)  except that I'm neurodivergent and it's difficult for me to think about multiple facets of a situation in real time, but that when someone points it out I can acknowledge I didn't think about that at first.\n\nAnd you portrayed that you assume the worst, that no one else can be ill informed or speak too quickly, just you, everyone else has to be a closeted asshole", "It's not about anyone being a main character. It's about exposure. Ignorant people hate people. Learned people understand people.", "I don't feel they should and I didn't think about it that way initially. In several comments I have since stated that there were aspects I didn't think about and that this program would definitely not be a good fit, because it could harm the child this person works with which is absolutely not okay. \n\nIn my initial comment, I guess I was imagining they would be heavily monitored and coached on how to be supportive to their \"little\" which would be great and universal empathetic tools. Not at the expense of worsening a child's mental/emotional state though and I recognize that", "Tbh at that point as a parent I'd want to go through her social media and see if she's been bullying there also. I know that sounds invasive and is a total invasion of privacy, but I'd at least want to know how extensive it is, if it's not just limited to at school. \n\nI wouldn't be the parent who constantly goes through my child's social media but if something like this happens, I'd want to know if there's more to it.", "OP is effectively destroying her social life, it's crazy.

She needs a harsh lesson.", "her parents and keep her from attending prom AND develop a plan to help her grow. if their daughter really wants to be better she will work hard to be better regardless of prom being a possibility or not. if she doesn't actually care to be better she's going to put on an act until she gets the green light for prom and she'll turn the act off as soon as she walks out the door to leave for prom. \n\nactions have consequences. the girl she bullied will carry that with her forever and so will her family. the girl she bullied is missing out on a homecoming and a prom with her friends and peers because she had to change schools because of bullying. the bully had a chance to learn from her losses. missing out on these things isn't keeping OP's daughter from learning and growing, but it is a reminder that your shitty actions have consequences and your consequences are out of your control. \"you ruined this girl's high school experience but if you work hard for a few months we'll give you back prom!\" is not the right message to send. consequences need to be permanent and they need to have real impact. why should a bully get the chance to experience something that the girl she bullied will never get to experience? the victim doesn't get a chance to fix things and go to prom with her classmates, so why should the bully?", "The issue here is that OPs child didn\u2019t show any remorse. She wasn\u2019t apologising for bullying or talking about how she fucked up. \n\nNo, all she was concerned about is that she would lose her pictures and miss out on a once in a lifetime experience, which the bullied child most likely will too. \n\nSo in this situation, I would honestly say that all of the punishments are deserved.", "I think above all , this thread shows how some parents,  parent . And some parents are too worried about being a friend .", "You keep using this same line dude. And people keep telling you the same thing.

A proper punishment for a kid is one that let's them know they were wrong while being able to better themselves. A proper punishment is not taking a special moment *a year down the road* away.

It's cowardly and shows you're afraid of differing opinions.", ">Yes, she needs severe punishment, because in the real world shit like this can get jail time or someone black listed from employment. She needs a harsh lesson.\n\nSo just to put this in perspective, we all agree she needs a harsh punishment. We are really just arguing about the timeline. For example, OPs child is likely going to college. Are you also advocating OPs child should be banned from clubs or social media while at college? Or are you relaxing those punishment then? \n\nPutting a punishment with such a lead time on such a momentous occasion can to build resentment for the parents rather than self-reflection and learning. It's also important to keep the timeline on the table here. In 9 months, OPs child will be 18 and legally an adult. After graduation, if you'd developed a punishment system that just builds resentment, they'll learn nothing then cut you out of their lives. So now they've learned nothing AND you lost the ability to guide your child. So working with a therapist/counselor to develop concrete goals and actions to learn and grow with the possibility of prom if they show genuine remorse is likely a better option than just banning it altogether, locking them down their senior year, then immediately lifting it for college.", ">her parents and keep her from attending prom AND develop a plan to help her grow.\n\nBut if you outright banhammer everything, what's her incentive to go? No electronics, no clubs, no prom, she'll be 18 in a few months. She can just ride out the resentment train until she's an adult then peace out anyway. The outright banhammer is the right move for the short term. I'm not convinced it's the right move for the long term.\n\n> if she doesn't actually care to be better she's going to put on an act until she gets the green light for prom and she'll turn the act off as soon as she walks out the door to leave for prom.\n\nThat's a risk with every punishment. We sent people to jail, they leave and immediately commit more crimes. This is why it's up to the parents to parent and see if it's real or an act.\n\n>why should a bully get the chance to experience something that the girl she bullied will never get to experience? the victim doesn't get a chance to fix things and go to prom with her classmates, so why should the bully?\n\nThe bullied child may be affected forever. Should OPs parents remind OP everytime they see them that they bullied this girl? Or should they move on. I'd argue the mindset of \"The bullied girl is permanently scarred, so we're going to permanently scar you\" is wrong.", "You can argue they're \"deserved\", but is the point of being a parent to give your child deserted justice? Or also balance it with trying to teach your child and have them self-reflect on this? Is outright bringing the banhammer down on everything for the next 9 months until they're an adult the best way to get your child to learn and grow? Probably not, you need a mix of justice and mercy, and if the punishment plan you are teaching brings about genuine understanding and remorse by March 2024, should prom still be out of the question? If your child learns their lessons, endured 7 months of a punishment plan, stuck to it and grew as a person, I think prom can still be in the picture.", "Or trying to develop punishments that will actually work while still allowing you to maintain a relationship with your child instead of punitive punishments that won't actually fix anything and instead just \"punish\" with no intent to fix", "K.

By the time OP daughter is 25 no one will remember any of those two days. But guess who will forever remember their high school time- the victim. So no she doesn\u2019t get prom or homecoming. She can work her way back up to a car- maybe by 20 or 21. And she would have to save to at least buy half of a used car. Because guess who she will be hanging with at those two events if she attends- her crew! So no. She FA and now she is FO about the consequences of her actions. Life lessons are hard. The resentment she should carry is toward herself and not her parents.

Give her a chance to change.  Get her into therapy, too, so she can sort out why she got pleasure from bullying.", "Salam! I think some pictures should be saved, although, she definitely needs punishment. The social media thing is actually great, since the bullying may have been caused from insecurities formed on there! Definitely talk to her and find out why she thought it was a good idea, and see if you can get her into Therapy or Counselling if needed. Tell her that if SOMEHOW she makes up for what she did, then, and only then can she go.. But if you see no improvement or think it\u2019s not good enough, definitely stand tall and dig your foot even deeper into the ground. That(bullied) poor girl will probably never be courageous enough to go to those events herself because of all the insecurities she now has. Also, I\u2019d suggest alerting the other parents if they don\u2019t know already, and letting them know the works. I would not be very lenient with your daughter, though. Racism is very deeply rooted and very hard to get rid of.. My dad is unfortunately an example of this, despite me being mixed.. Which is actually quite odd.. half supremacy I guess? Anyway, try to understand whether she is actually racist or was just pretending. It won\u2019t make it any better either way, but it would be good to know because if she was pressured into it by her friends it will probably be a lot easier to raise her into a better person and help her with helping herself in that regard. I hope this helps! If you couldn\u2019t tell, obvious NTA!\n\nEDIT: don\u2019t force her to be friends with anyone or into volunteering. That will only push the hatred and make her angry. Instead, really try to teach her, more than ever before, and maybe even get her siblings to help. Do NOT compare her to her siblings, though. That will only breed resentment and jealousy and that is NOT going to help. It will ruin her relationship with them and that is not very easy to fix at all.

But even extreme grounding and loss of privileges isn\u2019t really the answer here. \n\nThere is a concept called restorative justice which is emerging around race related problems which you may want to look into. The idea is that the best way to fix racial problems is to address the outcomes the victims have had to face. If your community/school doesn\u2019t yet offer guidance in this there are places online or community centers that do. \n\nThe goal shouldn\u2019t be just to punish your daughter for her actions but to provide a lifelong change in who she is and as much resolution as the girl she bullied wants and are not comfortable or with a distinct end for the agresor. Often it starts with education for the bully with things like taking courses on the history of racism at your local community college, working in nonprofit groups that serve the targeted community, time spent with a mentor from that community who volunteers in restorative justice, etc. it often includes reaching out to the bullied former classmate AFTER the prior steps have been taken and either engaging in mediation or asking how they would like to have amends made (if they feel it is possible). This is something that would be ongoing and not with a finite ending because the end goal is for your daughter to change who she is. \n\nOne of the fundamental factors your choices of punishment ignore is your daughters friend groups.

If she spends the whole school year knowing she can't go to prom, she is going to spend the entire year resentful.

Not to mention, a redemptive path can really drive home what she did was really bad.  As it is, she just isn't talking to friends outside of school? She's gonna be home alone and bored? Stewing in her own thoughts? That's a breeding ground for resentment.  But by having her, say, volunteer, she associates the action of doing those things with the punishment, and through working to regain her right to prom, she may learn to appreciate it more.\n\nEdit: I wanna add this, to everyone saying \"she was a bully don't make her volunteer they don't need to be mistreated\" you forget what high school bullies are.  They're packs. Even if she was the only one doing the bullying (which it didn't sound like was the case), she definitely would have her friends there laughing and backing her up. She may have a bad attitude at a volunteer place, but more likely once you take her away from her pack she will become docile.  That said, while she shouldn't be \"forced\" to volunteer, it absolutely should be an option. Regardless, high school kids are very peer pressure driven and tend to be molded by their environment quite a bit, even the rebellious ones.

Sometimes, previous trauma makes them angry and they want to be the one in control of that hurt rather than the one being hurt.

It just creates more resentment towards you that will last the rest of her life. Consequences for bad behavior are important, but lessons should be learned. Simply punishing someone with no positive reinforcement for fixing things just teaches them they need to be sneakier next time.\n\nEdit: FOMO from missing prom I don't think is unnecessarily cruel, but deleting her socials is the equivalent of burning her photo albums.

The bullying did not help his social anxiety, but it was not the cause of his mental health issues.
