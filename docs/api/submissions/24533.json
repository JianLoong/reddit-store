The person she bullied has also missed lifetime events - having a trauma free school life for one.

You'll soon find out which parent allows this sort of thing.", "NTA: this seems appropriate to the level of offense here, especially the deletion of social media accounts.\n\nThat said, there's a chance to teach the idea of repentance and redemption. Assuming you are in the US or Canada (I don't think homecoming is a thing elsewhere so I feel good about that assumption), the school year is just about to start and prom isn't until late April/early May. Create a plan of restorative actions she can take to earn back prom. These actions can include volunteer service, befriending someone who is an outcast at her school, cultural sensitivity classes, and (if possible) something that can positively impact the girl she bullied.\n\nAlso, giving her something to earn back like that let's her have a positive focus for the year. What she did was very wrong, and needs to have consequences, but it can be an important learning opportunity too.  Good luck.", "NTA and good for you for coming down hard on this, though I would maybe let her save the photos to a physical drive somewhere before she deleted the account.", "NTA.\n\nVictim of racist bullying here. That trauma follows you for the rest of your life and getting proper help is hard as even in large cities, it can be difficult to find a therapist that specialises in racial trauma, especially a none white therapist.\n\nParenting isn\u2019t always fun but your job is to raise a decent human that can contribute positively to this world. Sounds like you\u2019re doing your job. I wish more parents take note!", "Nta... I'd be making her use her socials to repent for her actions. \n\nTaking shit away doesn't really teach her anything. Already she's more focused on bargaining down instead of focusing that she forced a person to change schools to escape her toxicity.", "Nta. But save the pictures to a USB before deleting everything", "NTA\n\nAs a bullying victim myself, thank you for teaching her that there are consequences for such horrid behaviour.", " NTA. That\u2019s great parenting. When she gets in the real world the consequences can and will be more sever.", "NTA\n\nI honestly think it fits the crime.\n\nI'd just let her backup the photos from her insta, before forcing her to delete it. Btw, you do know that she can just create a new account, so her deleting it does nothing.", "NTA.  The lesson from this punishment will stick with her for a long time, just like the trauma of bullying sticks with its victims for a long time.  You absolutely are in the right here.   I didn\u2019t go to my prom and I turned out fine.  She\u2019ll survive and maybe remember this lesson.", "Prom isn't a right, it's a privilege.  She lost that privilege.

Racial bullying in and of itself needs severe consequences because it's never ever acceptable but the fact that this went on to the point the kid had to leave - woah no this needs some serious consequences.\n\nYou're doing the difficult bit of parenting here and I think you're doing it really well.  Putting her through these things is going to be rough for you as you're going to have to deal with her reaction and also her disappointment (which is never nice as a parent even if it is a just consequence as we don't want to see our kids upset ) but you're doing what needs to be done to teach her vital life lessons and hopefully helping her to move into adulthood as a kinder, more tolerant and respectful person. \n\nWell done - it's hard, it's horrible and it's shocking to find out your kid did that, but you're dealing with it well.", "Info: How long had it been going on before the girl moved schools and how come you only just found out? What are the other parents saying/ doing?", "Actions have consequences. That poor bulled student probably is now going to enjoy a prom.   NTA.", "What if you gave the the possibility of earning things back?\n\nThe point of punishing her is for her to learn from this.  To become a better person.  Often the best impetus for change is when people see you change and reward you for it.\n\nSo tell her that homecoming is gone, but if she genuinely learns from this and shows that she is a better person, she might be able to earn senior prom.  She\u2019s got to show real change and understanding.  She\u2019s got to do something that will really drive home for her how much harm she has done and how wrong her actions have been.  The person she is today?  That person doesn\u2019t go to prom.  But a kinder person, who chooses to be a force for good in the world?  A person who helps and supports instead of tearing down?  That girl could go to prom.  She just has to make a plan with you about how she demonstrates that she is that person.  The right kind of volunteering, like homeless outreach or big brothers/big sisters, might help break down her walls and start seeing people as people instead of things to manipulate again.  Might teach her some empathy.  If it\u2019s affordable for you, working with a therapist who specializes in bullying, both to counsel her and to build her road map to redemption, would be an excellent idea.\n\nLet her download her Instagram pics before you make her delete the account - there)s a balance to that.  She doesn\u2019t have to give up her only copy of important pics, but she loses the online presence.\n\nNTA, but I think there are more effective things you can do than creating this big punishment that you can\u2019t back down from.", "NTA. \n\n\"Yesterday I was informed that my daughter Sam was a part of a group of students who bullied another girl to the point that she had to switch schools. \"\n\nJust LET my daughter get caught doing shit like that...\n\nIf anything, your punishment is rather lenient.", "NTA. The punishment fits the crime. This girl had to uproot her life. What will her prom mean to her, in a school where she barely knows anybody? \n\nAnd if you go back on it now, what will your daughter learn from this?

Otherwise you'll be teaching her a lesson, but not a good one", "NTA the girl who had to switch schools will not be attending that prom will she? \nNow your daughter can have a once in a lifetime lesson. \nShe won\u2019t bully again !

But now, after you sauf what you said, you should not row back.\n\nBullying is serious and there can be no reward for begging.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too harsh. I was her age not too long ago and it\u2019s crazy to me to be bullying people at that age. This probably wasn\u2019t her first time being a nasty person either. She\u2019s going to be 18 soon and it\u2019s best to nip this as soon as and as best as you can otherwise she won\u2019t learn her lesson. This might be the wake up call she needs. Otherwise she could potentially end up like one of those racist young women that were recently on the news for yelling slurs and punching an Asian family because they thought they could get it away with it. Now they\u2019re in jail.", "NTA. Bullying is a major issue, it needs a major punishment.", "NTA.. Do the crime, do the time.", "NTA. She deserves it.", "NTA. What about that girls once in a lifetime homecoming and senior prom? Alot of things are once in a lifetime, that\u2019s why they are good for punishment. She basically made another persons life hell, she deserves all those punishments.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA. I\u2019d like to suggest trying to find a way for your daughter to write a letter of apology. A sincere apology, not just a note written in hopes of retrieving her losses. Not via social media or email  - a handwritten letter. Her school maybe able to a facilitate non-contact letter/card. \n\nPerhaps offer her a chance for Prom, if she writes a local or school newspaper article about how bad bullying is. \n\nCarry-on, Dad.

Sit down with your daughter and show her what can actually happen.", "Nta. I would allow her to download photos before deleting social media, as photos are precious. I would also suggest pushing towards making ammends more than just punishment, so apologising sincerely to the bullied student, volunteering somewhere to help others, especially if there's anywhere near you that has a youth club, she could volunteer at, volunteer with an anti-bullying charity, ask about doing an assembly at school, and your daughter, and the other bullies, should give a presentation about the dangers of bullying, and ways to help students who you fear are being bullied. Then possibly depending on how well she responds to the volunteering, allow her to attend 1 event, as long as she keeps up with making ammends for her bullying.", "NTA but let her keep the Instagram or at least download the photos first. She shouldn't have to lose out on those memories because of a punishment.", "NTA.\n\nIf she was bullying another girl to the point where her victim switched schools, she's inflicted massive damage on that poor girl's life, damage that may take years to heal, if it ever does. She deserves to find out what it means to miss out on \"once in a lifetime\" events, have her final year of high school wrecked, and to lose her precious photos.\n\nActions have consequences. Extremely harmful actions should have extremely harsh consequences.", "NTA.\n\nWhat about the person she bullied ? Didn't they miss anything from all the bullying ?\n\nShe's almost 18, not a kid. She absolutely deserves to miss those events for bullying a student so badly they changed school. \n\nI'd argue you should also use this as an opportunity to teach what racism does to people. What opportunity she has that other people won't get because their race is different. \n\nYou did good, but you could do more to ensure she actually understands the weight of what she did. \n\nThough, at almost 18, she should already know better.", "NTA. When our children fall below expectations it's our responsibility to hold them accountable.  \nThat poor girl who had to move schools has had her secondary school life traumatised, why on earth should your daughter come away unscathed?\nHave her download the pictures from the account, the rest of the punishments are entirely reasonable.", "NTA\n\nI would recommend transferring the pictures from her social media to a flashdrive, though. Then give her the flashdrive when she shapes up.", "NTA, if the poor girl had to move schools it must have been pretty serious. People take their lives over this sort of treatment. I agree taking privileges away is a good idea but possibly with the option to earn them back. Not through jobs but through understanding. I wonder if there is a program to help the less fortunate or some sort of buddy system or something that would help her understand how other people feel.", "NTA. I know of a few kids that were bullied in school so badly it led to self-harm and suicide. It's incredibly serious. Grandparents often have a blindspot when it comes to their grandchildren, obviously, who wouldn't? But you're doing the right thing imo. Back up her photos and memories, you can even download social media data in some cases, and then lock her down. I guess talk to parents and explain stamping out bigotry and hatred is far more important than a prom. I doubt the bullied child would be going to that prom if they hadn't already moved schools.", "NTA\n\nBut I'd like to know what it was that she and the group did and do the other parents know what happened and what's the consequence for their kids?\n\nIs she remorseful for her actions and what is she doing to give some restitution to the kid that was bullied.  At minimum that kid needs an apology and it may need to be written.. but it's up to the other kid as to whether they accept it or not.\n\nWhat you have to mindful of is that the punishment isn't just punitive that just makes her worse and ruins her relationship with you altogether.\n\nAs the bullying was racist, is there something she can do with the community that this other kid has a heritage with ie it might be volunteering at an organisation specific to that culture.\n\nIs your daughter really racist, or was she just following the crowd... that's a conversation in itself.\n\nAre there any legal ramifications for your daughter should the other family pursue it?  That's a harsh lesson for her.\n\nI'd probably look at compromises in regards to some of the activities she's going to miss.  Homecoming... too bad - doesn't deserve this.  Senior prom - this one I would look at compromises that might involve a chaperone and no hanging out with friends following the prom (and really the people she'd likely want to hand with might be the fellow bullies so I wouldn't want them hanging with them anyway).  Social media - see if she can preserve the photos.. then you can delete.  But you'll find that she'll just get a new account and when she's 18 she will anyway... she'll be not far off this.  Car... not deserved.  She should be working to pay for this herself.\n\nFrom the OP, the things that will hit her hardest will be prom and the photos.. it's like she's conceded the other things because she knows it's bad and she doesn't deserve them.\n\nWill the kid bullied that left be able to participate in the new schools prom and homecoming?", "You should have allowed her to download the photos first but otherwise you are letting her off easy", "Just be careful not to make your daughter become even more racist by her blaming the victim.", "NTA, \n\nwas the school notified of the bullying? why has there been no action against your racist bully daughter and her friends? They should have been expelled, to begin with, the reason going o their records. \n\nSecondly Completely justified punishments. From the history of your posts seems like your daughter is the entitled one and your wife tends to give into her demands. Like her wanting you to cancel your son's school Disney trip and your wife asking you to seriously consider it just because she couldn't go due to the pandemic. \n\nAnd absolutely make her drop those friends. They are either bad influences on each other or just multiplying their terror by being together.\n\nI would also recommend cutting her allowance completely for the summer/coming months and making her give it to her victim along with a sincerely written apology as to what she did and why was it wrong.", "NTA its clear she arent grasping the severity of the situation. Bullying can lead to suicide. This girl is gonna pay her whole life for your daughter's actions and may end up in a bad way. Once bullied its like bullies can sense it and target you, and even if not the emotional trauma is intense.   \nEveryone made some very good points and ideas as to how to expand the punishment to something teachable, and I fully support this", "I suspect this post is for Karma points (themes and the way it is written), but to humor the OP:\n\nThere are many ways to make this a teachable moment for her as well enact some kind of punishment rolled up in one that would be far more effective than what you propose.  What you propose in your post are options of all negative consequences which seems solely out of anger.  Even your own parents are disagreeing with you.  And if you go through with it with only a POV of anger, then that is what you will teach your kid to treat others as well.\n\nWhat would be better would be a suspension of privileges, maybe even delete some accounts (ONLY after saving the important pictures), and then more importantly doing things to learn why this was so bad.  You can be creative or mundane in formulating the teaching opportunities.  Things that might be helpful to teach EMPATHY and UNDERSTANDING would be:\n\nWatch videos and/or take classes on bullying.  Maybe you should attend them with her so you can discuss what was taught.\n\nGo volunteer or work for an non-profit that tries to help others less fortunate.   You can figure out the ones that exist in your local area that make the best fit for the circumstances.  IMO, serving others is one of THE most effective ways to teach people.\n\nWrite a long essay about her behavior for self reflection and improvement.\n\nIf the school offer a an anti-bullying club, have her join.\n\nHave her see a counselor/therapist.\n\n(And TBH, I have to question you as a \"father\", going on Reddit where all your posts seem like you are complaining about your daughter, there is certain irony here with use of SM. )", "NTA racist bullying till the kid changed schools... and I bet her social media is where more happened...  tell her to download the pics while you sit with her and then delete IG too", "NTA.\n\nYep, when you traumatize someone to the point they transfer schools and you are a racist?! That's deserves missing out on some once-in-a-lifetime stuff.\n\nA friend of mine who is in her mid-40s STILLS remembers her bully, who made life such hell she had to transfer schools and spent years in therapy for it. \n\nThat's how damaging it can be.", "INFO: Would you consider letting her back up her Instagram (maybe with only you have access to the back up file) so the images aren't lost?

Otherwise NTA.", "NTA - I agree that her punishment needs to be severe because of the severity of bullying she did with her friends, however... You can't force her to delete her social media accounts, especially as she is nearly 18 (from what I could tell from the story). I think missing prom and homecoming is enough to punish her.", "YTA\n\nHow about your family do some charity work TOGETHER? Instead of making her miss prom, teach her instead what it is like to be bullied by having her volunteer WITH YOU at homeless shelters, food banks, and other similar outreach programs? Teach her empathy. Otherwise you're only teaching her to be sneakier.", "You\u2019re NTA, but surely punishment is not the answer. Your daughter needs therapy. Perhaps the therapist can suggest ways she can learn empathy for others, including apologizing. I wouldn\u2019t stop her from going to her high school prom. She doesn\u2019t need harsh punishments; she needs understanding and help.", "Maybe disabling rather than deleting her accounts for as long as she's grounded would mean she doesn't lose those photos and memories?

I never backed up my photos from my late teens and they're all gone ever since MySpace stopped being a thing, and I do wish I had saved them. \n\nThe idea that a bully feels entitled to go drop her punishment in order to go to parties (\"once in a lifetime\" - dramatic teen bullshit) or expects to just be given a car says a lot about how spoilt and entitled she is though. \n\nNTA.", "The social media deletion is cruel since it contains deep memories and relations to people she likes.

But unless she has a friend a year younger than her or a grade  lower than she won\u2019t be able to go to prom ever which I think everyone should be able to go to.  However,, I do think that bullying is unacceptable and racism is unacceptable. I fundamentally disagree with punishment based parenting, and I think that parents should parent their children by teaching them that actions have consequences instead of just simply punishing them. But that\u2019s just my personal opinion. I think that this child should be able to keep her Instagram account for the photos but if she wants to text friends, she has to have an adult beside her at all times. If this daughter hasn\u2019t apologized to the girl or even attempted to rectify things with the girl. She should do that as a way of you know making the situation, right. If she apologizes to the girl and the girl forgives her and she excepts the apology from the daughter, then I think that any punishment afterword is completely useless.

And i would go ballistic, too, if i found put my kid was bullying someone, and worse if she/he does it in a racist way. However, I think just punishment might not be enough, she has to understand why this was terrible. Kids who  just\" get punished become sneaky because they are in fear, they often do not really better their ways. \n\nAs a little story: a kid i knew once bullied someone with down Syndrome. The father punished him, but also made him go to the house of the family doing Chores and helping the kid. Through that, the bully kinda realized the kid was a human being, too. The bullying stopped. \n\nSince I think punishment alone is not enough amd the kid has to learn, YTA. It is a very very Strict approach to parenting (which might be ok?) but i think too onesided on the punishment-side. I would maybe advise a different approach. Otherwise she might just feel resentment and does just learn to je even more sneaky around you.\nI would say being grounded and having no social media might be punishment enough. The next punishment shoukd include something that makes her think. Missing prom and all that is not in my opinion.", "NTA.  Let her back up the pictures on the Instagram account under supervision before deleting it.\n\nI would propose allowing her to attempt to earn back prom attendance since that is in the spring, but homecoming attendance is off the table.\n\nYour parents are wrong about it being too harsh to delete her social media.  I'm betting her social media accounts will show where she picked up on some of the racist, bullying behavior in the first place.

I do think giving her an opportunity do things that earn her access to one of the events and if IG is important, you can take over her IG change her password/recovery email so she could also possibly earn it back by the end of the school year. You would need to set up things she would have to accomplish to earn it back. Ie, therapy, racial sensitivity training, doing a research project on the history and harms of racism and anti bullying training, community service , getting a job where all money goes into an account to pay for the event attire if she is able to earn it back. If not, give the money to a charity that is meaningful to this incident. After she's done all that, she would have to also write a meaningful letter of apology to the victim.

It doesn\u2019t seem to be dealing with the underlying issue of figuring out where she got these racist ideas. Is she already friends with kids who are racist bullies or is she trying to impress kids who are racist bullies? Either way, simply punishing her isn\u2019t necessarily going to make the punishment go away. This seems to especially be the case since she has no social media, no option to get a car, and no access to school dances.

The rest seems ok. But most importantly, talk with her or send her to therapy about why she did it. Yes punishment is needed, but understanding and questioning of her acts and motivation is as well. I used to get bullied in school too, and in my understanding bullies do it because A) they're unhappy/ lacking something in life themselves or are jealous of the victim and trying to put them down to feel better themselves B) if they aren't the main instigator, they feel a lot of pressure to fit in and follow what their friends do. \n\nSo yes, she needs to learn that regardless of her motivation, bullying is never a viable reaction. She has to learn empathy, and she needs consequences. But she also needs understanding in case what drove her to such horrid actions is an ongoing problem for her that needs to be solved.

I missed mine, obviously, but I have much bigger issues. I'm saying this because the consequences of bullying is always overlooked. At school, sure it was harmful to me and some things had to be done, but they (the school and bullies) never thought about the future and how it would all affect me.

The bullying was endless, and there was nothing anyone would do to help me stop it. The teachers, principle, counselors did nothing. Absolutely nothing. Parents did not care that their children were relentlessly hounding my child, scrawling racial slurs on his locker, or his books or in social media.

If there's a way to get her into a position of volunteering or listening to people's testimonies about how bullying affected them, it might be more impactful. It's an opportunity for growth. She might view the original punishment with resentment and immaturity that could potentially lead her to forming more unhealthy mental/emotional habits. Perhaps teaching her empathy is more effective in the long run, though it can take more time and effort than is sometimes doable depending on circumstances. There's a channel called soft white underbelly on YouTube that has tons of personal testimonies.
