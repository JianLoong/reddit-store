My other sister (24F) lives with the oldest sister but has a range of special needs and will be staying with my BIL's parents, who live next door to them. This will be my first time looking after my nephew on his own. We've tried with his mum in a different room in the past, but he cries for his mother, which is understandable. \n\nI was getting back to the point! My sister came round today with my nephew to stay around for two hours or so to have a bit of a break from their house, and my sister saw my next-door neighbours. My sister spoke to my neighbour and said she and her husband are going away for the weekend, so my nephew will come around and stay here for the weekend, and it is the first time without his parents. My neighbour, who has three kids and a husband herself, mentioned she's also going away this weekend as she's going to see a friend and looking for a babysitter. \n\nMy sister dared to tell my neighbours that her kids could stay next door with me as I babysat my nephew anyway. Here's the thing! My neighbour's husband is home, and he has the weekend off, and they're his kids. \n\nWhen I found out my sister said the neighbour's kids were coming round, I said they were not; I only agreed to babysit my nephew. My sister thinks I'm being harsh and selfish because I don't like kids, and I don't want any of my own, and she thinks that's why I'm being nasty about not babysitting my next-door neighbour's kids. However, if next door asked me, it would still be a no because the dad is home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694099537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ciddd/aita_for_only_babysitting_my_nephew_and_not_my/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s a disaster and you should not be responsible for 3 children and a baby. If she wants to help them out so bad she can cancel her vacation and watch all the kids herself.
