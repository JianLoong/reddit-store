My neighbour's husband is home, and he has the weekend off, and they're his kids. \n\nWhen I found out my sister said the neighbour's kids were coming round, I said they were not; I only agreed to babysit my nephew.

What is she thinking?!!?!", "NTA", ">  When I found out my sister said the neighbour's kids were coming round, I said they were not; I only agreed to babysit my nephew. My sister thinks I'm being harsh and selfish because I don't like kids, and I don't want any of my own, and she thinks that's why I'm being nasty about not babysitting my next-door neighbour's kids. However, if next door asked me, it would still be a no because the dad is home.   \n   \nNTA, tell your sister she can tell them, or she can find other childcare herself.", "26 and 40 eh", "> a sister (26F) who is going away this weekend with her husband (40M) \n\nWTF?", "NTA -  \nYour sister should not be volunteering you to babysit anyone. Watching 1 kid is way different than watching 4. No thank you.", "NTA. Your sister massively overstepped. Looking after 4 kids is very different from 1 child. Volunteering you without your consent is crappy. Please tell your neighbour that your sister was mistaken, and establish a firm boundary with your sister that if she does this shit again that your babysitting services will no longer be available to her.", "Your sister just screwed up your relationship with your neighbor. If you allow your sister to give away your time like this, she'll do it again AND your neighbor will now expect you to babysit for her in the future. If you put a stop to your sister's BS, and tell your neighbor your sister screwed up, neighbor will hold it against you.  Don't have your sister anywhere near people you associate with again, she's an AH.  Tell sister you're not babysitting for her again until she fixes the situation in a way you are satisfied with.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nTell her she\u2019s welcome to stay home and watch them but she doesn\u2019t have the right to tell others how to spend your time.", "NTA!! Don\u2019t watch your neighbor\u2019s kid!! It\u2019s the father\u2019s responsibility!! He will be home!!", "Time to rescind your offer to your sister!  WTF that she's volunteering you to watch 3 more kids, you'll be busy watching her 1 year-old.  The father of the kid can parent his own kids (not babysit), there is zero reason for you to watch 4 times as many kids as you signed up for.  NTA.", "Uber duber fuck your sister. Watching one kid is enough of a problem. Who cares what your reason is, you shouldn't have to watch more kids than you want to. Your sister is out of this world, no words. The fact that you would entertain it if it weren't for the dad being home makes you a saint in my book. He made 'em he can watch them.  Not your problem. If your sister gives you anymore shit say, you're right I don't like kids, I don't think I'll watch yours either\".\n\nEdit: were you going to at least be paid for the extra kids? Not that your sister is in the right, I just want to see how deeply she is an asshole.", "NTA", "NTA. People volunteering my time/money is my ultimate pet peeve.", "NTA. I can't say what I think of your sister due to civility rules. You should never agree to babysit her child again though.  Some people are such people pleasers and want to be the hero in every situation that they make these inappropriate promises. Tell your neighbor directly that your sister was mistaken. There is a world of difference between babysitting one relative who is already probably going to have separation issues and taking on responsibility for three more. It's not even safe because your attention will be spread too thin.", "NTA She isn't allowed to pimp you out to the neighbors. Tell the neighbor that you will Not be babysitting for them and that your sister had No right to say otherwise. I'd make this my last favor for that sister", "I'd have to ask my sister if it's hard living in such a dark place. You know. With your head up your ass...", "The unmitigated gall!", "Despite being on reddit for over a year, sometimes words fail me.", "If OP is okay with kids, suddenly dealing with four could well change that.\n\nHer sister needs a reminder the other people are not hers to volunteer.", "I can\u2019t even", "I love this answer. The last point is spot on", "Better yet sister can babysit this weekend.\n\nIf she had volunteered me I would have said \u201cguess what? I\u2019m not babysitting ANYONE now. Tell the neighbor you\u2019re free to watch her kids.\u201d", "Or your sister can give up her weekend away and babysit them all.", "Especially when it\u2019s the one-year-old\u2019s first time without his parents and it sounds like he might struggle with some separation anxiety.  He\u2019s going to need a lot of attention.", "Eh, what's 3 more kids anyways. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nI would've been so upset I don't think I would've even watched the nephew at that point. That Free's the sister up to watch the neighbors kids since she's feeling so charitable.", "It would have taken me about 5 seconds to tell sis seeing she has no respect for your wishes. She should find another babysitter. Nip it in the bud now. This kind of behavior from your sister will only get worse. NTA by a mile.", "Sames.  Does this shit really happen to normal people?", "I couldn't even either.", "Straight up that would be my answer.", "Right? Why would she volunteer for her kid to have less attention?", "It ain't the weekend yet.\n\nThere's still time for OP *coughcough* to suddenly be too sick to help.", "Best comment", "I don't know but every time I feel like I'm a train wreck - I come on here and suddenly feel so much better about myself.", "So she could be the good guy for zero cost.", "Considering the entitlement and Impertinence of the sister I would cancel and tell he good luck with finding a babysitter or she can stay home and babysit the neighbor's children.\n\nWTF is she on?! \n\nNTA op", "Oh I'd be loud and proud that I was cancelling due to her entitlement. Did the sister even offer to pay more?", "\ud83d\ude02 seriously", "Hell don\u2019t babysit him either", "What did I just read?? I mean what!! Your sister is HORRIBLE! I would tell her \u201chere is your baby and good luck finding a babysitter for your baby and my neighbor\u2019s kids\u201d. You are a kind and patient woman! if she was my sister, we wouldn\u2019t be talking ever again!", "Oh my GOD!  How dare she volunteer you for that, when you're doing her this huge favor??\n\nLet the neighbor dad parent his own kids, and tell your sister she can find another babysitter. What a nerve she has!!\n\nNTA, but your sister very definitely is.", "NTA. And I would not be babysitting for her again because she is taking your help for granted", "NTA. ALL THE NTA EVER. \n\nWhat??!! Was your sister drunk at the time? Even if you loved kids and loved to babysit entire clutches of them all the time, why would she volunteer you for an entire weekend for **three** other unknown kids?\n\nAnd on top of that you'll be dealing with a 1 year old who'll probably be having some separation anxiety and needs your focus.\n\nOP be sure the neighbor knows your sister has a weird sense of humor and was only kidding, and you are definitively not watching her kids.  At this point I'd probably want to tell sis she should help your neighbor find a babysitter so they can share the cost, cuz you're not watching nephew either", "NTA from 1 kid to 4 ? That is very tough enough for an experienced babysitter.  What is your sister projecting ? Why does she have to volunteer you so that she could be the nice guy and you the bad guy with your neighbor ? That\u2019s so strange . And why does she think you are harsh and selfish for not volunteering to watch three additional kids suddenly ? \nStop helping your sister after this weekend and clarify directly to your neighbor so she doesn\u2019t dump her kids on you .", "NTA.  You said yes to babysitting one child.  You did not agree to watch four children.  Four kids and one adult is too much.  Your sister was way out of line to volunteer your services.", "NTA your sister is as it's a world of difference between having 1 and having 4 and she thought she could decide for you.\n\nTell her that the deal is off and instead the neighbour's kids are coming to her place.", "If you sister want to help put this lady, she can opt to not go out of town and babysit your neighbors kids herself. \nNTA and I would make sure it is clear to your neighbor you will not be watching her kids and if she tries you will be calling the police for abandonment. Their father can watch and parent his own kids.", "Ew, NTA! Make sure your neighbour is fully aware that you will NOT be babysitting her kids. You don't need to explain why, if she asks further questions tell her your sister made an error and it's not yours to fix. The utter GALL of your sister!", "NTA also why the fuck are they leaving a one month old to go for a holiday. They sound ridiculously selfish.", "What the hell!!! Your sister is so lucky you\u2019re babysitting your nephew, I can\u2019t believe she thought it was appropriate to offer you up to baby sit the neighbours. \n\nThe neighbour should know that\u2019s a big ask lol \n\nNTA", "Big sister is an entitled asshole, even if you were willing it wasn't her call to make. You have every right to decide who you will and won't babysit . NTA.", "I love when people are so generous with other people's times or resources", "NTA. You never never do that to someone.  That's rude AF", "NTA  she had no right volunteering your time to others.\n\nYou mentioned that your nephew cries after awhile wanting his mom.  He may or may not do this again, but who wants to deal with a crying baby and 3 other children will want to play? \n\nGoing forward, might be best to either not babysit any longer,  only babysit at her house, or have them hire a babysitter or grandparents. \n\nIf she insists you won't babysit other people's children because you don't like children - ask why she's bringing her child to you? Because i would not leave my child with someone who doesn't like children.", "NTA neighbours kids are not your problem.", "NTA", "NTA.\nSounds like she has FOUR children tbh", "Cancel sister\u2019s babysitting too since she\u2019s an idiot. Who the hell does she think she is, volunteering your services to the neighbours?", "Your nephew has 25 percent of his DNA in common with you. These other children? Stuff all. A man can feel obliged to help with a nephew, but he is being as natural as oxygen to say no when strangers are involved.\n\nThere are potential legal ramifications if children are hurt in your house when you are minding them, just to be clear.\n\nNTA. I am surprised you needed to ask.", "No", "NTA\n\nGoing from one, one year old to 4 young kids of varying ages.  Nope, no way.\n\nMaybe tell the sister that the neighbours husband will be a better baby sitter for her kid seeing as he's got more experience than you.  If he can look after 3 then a 4th should be no problem.\n\nI don't think I'd offer again any time soon.", "This doesn't sound real to me. It doesn't make sense that a FTM would let someone without baby experience watch their newborn for the weekend. Then they decided to overcomplicate things by inviting 3 unattended children that she doesn't know over? I just don't buy that at all.", "NTA. Firstly, no one can volunteer your time like this. Expecting you to be ok with looking after three extra kids is ridiculous.\n\nSecondly, why is the father not parenting his own kids? Tell your neighbour that you are unavailable.", "NTA.\nYour sister and the neightbour are.", "your sister vollteered you. so she can stay and watch the neighbours kids and son. thank you very much.

You don\u2019t need some neighbors kids there too", "Not only that but she had no right to tell that much information to the neighbor.", "Plus the sister overstepped by talking so much to the neighbor. Like, that conversation was just...weird. Does she know the neighbor? Because I'd be pissed if my sister/brother started up a conversation with MY neighbor and telling that neighbor MY business and MY plans. Like - wth???", "This made me cackle aloud", "I have not heard this turn of phrase for many years, and it unlocked a happy memory, so thank you for this!", "That phrase I would give more than one upvote to if possible.", "This^^^", "NTA and I wouldn't even give her the chance. A simple \"I will not be volunteered by you and since you think I am so horrible and child hating you need to find someone else this weekend for nephew. Maybe you and the neighbor can find someone else together.\"", "It's kinda automatic for me when I read \"The nerve\" or \"The utter nerve\", I have to type it in as reply. I heard both phrases so many times in my mom's family when I was growing up, it's ingrained in my brain, now.", "Not even volunteered, more volutold. Volutelling is the worst."]}
