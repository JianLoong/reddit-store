My parents got a cabin at a lake about an hour away for the weekend. My mom asked if him and the little kids could stay one night instead of two. That sounded good to me. Its hard for me to spend much time with the big girls with the little kids around. I'm the one that works and does most of the childcare. It wouldn't be much of a break for me with them there the whole time. He has told me several times if I want some time alone with the girls he can stay the night as his dads. I've never taken him up on it. He got mad and said they just won't go. I want them to go, I just want to spend some time with the girls and my family too. He loves going to his dads and doesn't often. I know he got left out a lot as a kid so maybe it was triggering. I would be glad to pay for them to do something else fun too.

You say the youngest already has issues when you show attention to your own kids, how do you think that will play out for your own kids in the future? \n\nYou say you don\u2019t want his kids to miss out but do you care about what your own kids are missing out on?

Does he cook or clean?  What activities does he do with his kids? Or yours for that matter? \n\nDo you live together? How long have you been dating?

How long your own children have to take the backseat to their own mother? esp. since from the way you describe it, it's been more than six months that your partner and his kids become your first priority, that is six months too long.

Explain that you aren't trying to exclude his kids but giving the older ones some one on one time.  The younger ones will get that as well at other times.

I homeschooled them and didn't work for most of their lives. They're very securely attached kids. Its mostly circumstantially that I'm spending more time with the little ones but I know I need to consciously balance that out. If he was always just worthless for no reason we wouldn't be together. He is disabled and has had serious mental health flare ups the past six months or so that he is just coming out of. I do have strict boundaries and a plan in place for further improvement. Being overly sensitive to rejection can be a symptom of adhd and it def is for him. If he was physically disabled or got very sick I would also have to temporarily step up and do the bulk of things and no one would say that was wrong. In the event that he doesn't or is unwilling to stick to the plan to be more functional and involved, we will separate. In that event, what EVERYONE, my kids included, decided was that I would get emergency custody of the little kids until he was able to care for them. Yes I actually talked to them honestly about it and asked what they wanted. They're very open and honest with me. People need help sometimes. Yes I've been a caretaker to my partner at times, but it hasn't always been one sided and it won't always be, or it won't be a thing. But in the meantime I would like to do something nice as a family and also spend some time with the girls. I hope that he uses that time to get some one on one fun time with his kids, which is also something they deserve. If he makes a nice, exciting plan I don't think it will be upsetting for them to leave early if he doesn't make it upsetting.", "YTA. You're clearly playing favorites with the kids, prioritizing your daughters over his. You've taken on the role of the primary caregiver for his children, but now you want them to leave the vacation early so you can have alone time with your girls? That's selfish and unfair.
