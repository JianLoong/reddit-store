We are building a home across the street and in the mean time, we have a camper parked on SILs property. The only time we go in to her house is to use the bathroom or shower (we have electricity in the camper but no running water). The rest of the time we are across the street building and our kids (14m, 12f, 8m) are with us helping. We pay SIL $180 a week to park our camper there, which is campground prices. \n\nLate afternoon yesterday my SIL asked us to all come inside to talk and she pulls up her chore list, with my kids names added to it. Things like laundry, dishes, cleaning the living room, sweeping, mopping, cleaning table + countertops, garbage, returnables, even helping cook meals (we do not eat with them), etc. She said \"Does this work for you? I won't let anyone clean the bathroom because I'm the only one who does it properly.\" I immediately said no. My kids don't even go in her house unless they are showering or shitting so if anything, I'd make them clean the bathroom, not the rest of the house that they don't use. I'm not going to be making them do chores to that extent for simply using the bathroom, after they've been helping us all day with building our home. My SIL, who works all the time, says \"the kids are in here much more than that because all my snacks are gone and I always come home to a trashed house and I didn't before you guys started staying here\". She's clearly not putting two and two together with the fact that her own daughter (12) has had consistent friends over for the past 2 weeks since school let out and her husband (46m) does nothing to parent. Which I brought to her attention. My kids don't eat her food at all either. I've made a point to preach to my kids about minimizing our foot print here for this specific reason (her trying to blame my kids for her trashed house). \n\nMy husband is saying that maybe I should just allow her to add the kids to one or two chores a week to keep his sister at bay but I've refused. We pay to be here and we do not go indoors at all unless it's for the bathroom, as I've stated. My kids are not going to be scrubbing her house top to bottom for using a restroom and I have since told my husband we need to create an outhouse system (on our property) so we don't have to go in there at all. He says I'm making things more difficult when in reality, I'm protecting my kids from being used.

Yes, the chore list is maybe even a little long for if she believed they were trashing her house (cooking meals they won't eat) but if she thinks your kids are at the level of disrespect of going into her home and eating all her food, I can see that having some sort of specific purpose rather than her just wanting to pile on chores so she doesn't have to do them. \n\nThat said, I would suggest a compromise that the kids and both parents can each do one chore *equivilant* in labour to bathroom cleaning in place of cleaning the one facility you are using, of which she is cleaning up after you all. If she cleans the bathroom three to four times a week, that would imo mean you should each be doing a chore that needs doing aproximately once a week, about the equivilant of if you'd all have taken a turn cleaning the bathroom. \n\nI would maybe suggest offering to just film the coming and goings of her home for the day from the outside so she can see how many friends her daughter is bringing and how long your family is in the home, if you're having problems with her believing that your kids aren't the ones making messes. I would also suggest preparing yourself to say, \"well rent a bathroom trailer and put it on our property and move our trailer to our property and hand in our keys to the house\" if she still doesn't believe you.\n\nBut even if she doesn't believe you, I have a hard time ascribing her the assholery without knowing if her children or husband are deliberately creating this story to get out of cleaning their messes? I could totally see a young girl who now has to share bathroom space thinking she'll let her friends trash the house and blame her cousins, or a sitcom dad who doesn't want to clean the mess he's allowing his daughter to make to just create the narrative that you guys are doing it. That would make the liars the assholes, not her for believing her immediate family's story over yours. So just be willing to move the trailer and bathe elsewhere rather than starting a war.", "I\u2019d go buy a camera and tell her to put it up in her kitchen so she can see what\u2019s going on when she\u2019s not there.

I\u2019d also be asking what her daughter and friends will be doing for chores and what her husband will be doing. You could always get a go pro and have one of your kids wear it when they go in the house to capture everything that\u2019s going on and then show her.

If this is important to the sister, why would they not do a little extra in the last few months, just to keep the peace? I'm sure it's been a strain on the sister as well, who have opened her home for a family, and had construction next to her house. I'm not saying she is right, I'm saying I understand that she has feelings too. As someone who did build a house next to family on a farm, I'm just saying unreasonable feelings are still feelings.

They\u2019re absolutely the favorites, and \u201cas the oldest\u201d it\u2019s always been my job to sacrifice for them, and give up my share. I had to sleep on the floor in the living room as a kid because \u201cthey just should have their own rooms.\u201d I\u2019m 6 years older than my next sibling. I was 14 while my 8 year old sister took over my room. Oh, and the two of them couldn\u2019t sleep separately, so it was just turned to a play room for them after about 2 months. \n\nWe don\u2019t speak anymore.

So if it's Palm Springs California then they're definitely paying out the nose for electricity, but if it's Palm Springs Florida then electricity is pretty cheap. Still gets stupid hot in both during the summer, it just depends on whether you prefer an oven or a sauna.", "It's still relatively cheap in the western US. California utilities have raised rates for \"reasons\" but nothing like housing. \n\nA full size RV is 320-400 square feet (97-121 sqm). Costs of heating or cooling that will not be very expensive anywhere in the US, and that's the largest expense you'd face.", "Then the chores need to be specific to that like op said.

The best solution would be to have them clean the bathroom every other week (in rotation with SIL's kids), but SIL wants to do it herself \"so it gets done right.\"  It seems reasonable to me that OP's family/kids swap another chore of equal \"value\" for the bathroom cleaning.", "User name checks out.", "lol Yes I\u2019m sure you cleaned up after your family\u2019s dishes and did their house chores for their kids while their spouse did fuck all.

I thought my parents are bad, but nope. Mine are fine, just rough around the edges compared to what I just read. \n\nThe audacity to demand a property because...family.

My roommate who owns the house and to whom I pay rent has to do all the chores?  Coolio.\n\nBe realistic.  They are not staying at a hotel with an agreement to have maid service once a day.  They are renting space from someone and using part of their home.  It's not unreasonable for that rental agreement to include chores commensurate with the usage.", "So you\u2019re saying you\u2019d not only do those things, but you would make your kids do them?\n\nYour family sounds\u2026not nice.
