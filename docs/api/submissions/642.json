My partner (26M) and I (21F) have a 19 month old son together. Yesterday he developed a terrible cough and I ended up having to take him to the ER because he wasn\u2019t breathing well. My partner was at work and came to the hospital when he got off of work. \n\n\n     They decided to keep our son on oxygen overnight to monitor him. We both stayed the night here. \n\n\n      Today my partner went back to work and I stayed at the hospital with our son, who keeps getting sicker. Well just about an hour ago, I was wondering where his dad was because it was 10:30pm and he was off work at 9pm. I checked he location and saw he wasn\u2019t at work and asked him if he\u2019s coming back to the hospital. He said yes he just got some food with a friend and he\u2019ll be there soon. Well 30 more minutes pass and I\u2019m kinda getting upset and told him I feel like me and our son are not a priority right now because he should\u2019ve came here as soon as he could and he replied that well he\u2019s sleeping anyways so why does it matter. This escalated into a huge argument and ended with him saying I\u2019m treating him like he\u2019s a terrible father and calling me a bunch of horrible names and then saying that he\u2019s not coming. \n\n      I guess what I am trying to ask is that is it wrong of me to say that he should\u2019ve came here first? To make sure we are okay and his son is doing alright and it just be supportive and here? I feel like maybe I could\u2019ve handled the situation differently but I also feel like he does this a lot when it\u2019s a time of need.

It would be different if you were each taking agreed upon breaks but somebody needs to be there in case he gets worse. Idk, an argument wouldn't stop me from walking in with like $1 stuffed animal for my kid and getting a face-to face update on what's happening.", "NTA. Work I understand, dinner I do not.", "NTA. Any caring parent would drop everything to go to their child who's health is worsening instead of hanging out for hours with friends", "NTA he is a horrible parent who prioritized getting food with a buddy over being with his family. Wonder what else he\u2019s been up to. This should be a deal breaker.", "NTA y'all aren't his priority.  Actions speak louder than words.  If my daughter was in the hospital getting worse by the day, I doubt wild animals could keep her father from her.  Let alone eating with a friend.  Absolute BS.", "NTA... he is being a bad father and a horrible partner.  If your son is sick enough to be in hospital, he should have gone directly from work and he should have been checking in on you both throughout the day.  \nLISTEN TO HIM- HE TOLD YOU ABOUT HIMSELF TODAY- this was him being honest about his priorities....\nWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "NTA\n\n> he replied that well he\u2019s sleeping anyways so why does it matter\n\nYou're not sleeping.   You're there worrying about your child and he's off eating with a friend.", "NTA, but OP that\u2019s a scary situation to be in. Do you have any other emotional support system? Please call a friend or family to give you a proper break to shower, eat, breathe! \n\nYour partner is so wrong for leaving you alone in this hard time", "NTA\n\n1. His son is in the hospital. Any act other than being there as soon as possible automatically makes him a bad parent\n\n2. If he's mad at you (which he shouldn't be) he should still be at the hospital. A mature adult parent will put those feelings on hold to be there for their child.", "NTA. The kid might be sleeping but you\u2019re there worrying and he isn\u2019t there to support you both.", "NTA. Your BF not coming back to the hospital and instead going to eat with a friend was a major AH move.", "NTA- he was totally wrong to go out after work without even checking in with you.  Stand your ground on this one - don\u2019t let him gaslight you.", "NTA he feels that way because he is.", "You are not TA. As a parent myself I can tell you now, the first few years are going to be constant stress, second guessing and plenty of ER visits.  You are both exhausted, physically and emotionally drained I\u2019m sure. In my opinion this is just the way your husband(NTA) is dealing with this. He is probably just trying to unwind for a bit, and  as long as he isn\u2019t out all night long being irresponsible I wouldn\u2019t be so hard on him . That being said, he should extend the same curtesy to you as well.\n      You as a mom of course want to be there at all times, but remember your child is in the hands of trained medical professionals. Take a deep breath. You guys will all be home together as a family soon:) Best of luck!", "INFO I think this could simply be a matter of communication and reacting quickly to someone stating something carelessly or casually, or it could be that he's being irresponsible, but it's hard for us to know without a more verbose description of the conversation that you had.\n\nBut since you're here anyway, I think you shouldn't try to dwell on this situation for too long. If he's shirking his fatherly responsibilities, that should become fairly obvious in the future anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hypothetically, When he reached middle age and had to stay in the hospital for medical reason, how would he feel if your son ,by then would b a working adult, went to chill n hang with his friends instead of visiting him?\nIf it turns out he is honestly comfortable with his son or even yourself as his wife not visiting him, I doubt his priority as a long-term family man.", "Yeah this guy isn\u2019t going to stick around.

I was with him the entire time, except for one grocery run, and I hurried through that, because I just wanted to be with him. My wife didn't stay too long.  She doesn't like hospitals and sitting around.  When she did come it was just me and the boy playing video games.  She'd get bored and leave.\n\nWe knew ahead of time that I was better suited for sitting bedside.  We decided that I would take the time off, she would work and take care of home stuff and give me some respite time, if needed.\n\nWe communicated.  You guys did not. \n\nCommunication is a two way street.  He didn't text you all day.  Did you text him?  I know you perceived that he done wrong.  And he did.  But did you explain your expectations, your needs and wants. Or did you just assume you were on the same page here?", "That\u2019s how I felt too. I mean if it was the other way around and he was here and I was at work I\u2019d be rushing over ASAP", "Sleeping or not\u2026 he should want to know what\u2019s going on and see him. Just in the time he\u2019s been at work he developed a fever of 101", "He tried backtracking and saying he was getting food for \u201cus\u201d but now he\u2019s not giving it to me.", "That\u2019s how I feel too\u2026 there\u2019s been a few times of \u201cthat should be a dealbreaker\u201d when you\u2019re in a toxic relationship it\u2019s hard to leave especially when you have a child with them \u2026.", "He didn\u2019t even text me once today\u2026 like to check in at all\u2026 I didn\u2019t even think about that really..

His son is in the hospital. He has been off of work for 2 1/2 hours and  still didn't go visit. IDk, maybe the mother would like a break? And the excuse of he is sleeping just shows he does not give AF about the son or his GF.

And then he has the audacity to read you the riot act when you're understandably hurt and pissed?? No ma'am.\n\nI'm so sick of seeing so many stories, seemingly everywhere, about shitty people who become shitty partners and even shittier parents. Is your son going to really understand that Dad wasn't there tonight? Probably not. And even if he does realize it, will he remember? No. But that doesn't mean Dad gets a get-out-of-fathering free card, and it sure as hell doesn't excuse him from being there with and for YOU.  To put it very mildly, it sounds like a serious discussion needs to be had between the two of you about responsibilities and expectations. Like, yesterday. \n\nI'm sorry you have your partner's lack of compassion and decency to deal with on top of worrying about the health of your baby, and I hope your son is back home and on the mend soon.", "About deal-breakers ... What if you were in the hospital .. what would he do then?", "You should leave because it is SO obvious that he does not care about you or your child! Open your eyes and see the truth!", "I suspected this... he should have been bringing you dinner. \nI'm sorry but you deserve a partner. He is not interested in being this for you. Gather a support system around you, friends and family, and make a plan to make the changes you need for you both. \nAnd I hope your child is better soon, it's such a helpless feeling when they are sick. Call in some family or friend, dont let yourself get isolated from your supporters", "Not the point overall, I know! But please do take a little break when you need to! Let one of little man's nurses know you need to take five (or 20), and I promise they'll understand. Presumably he's being monitored and well cared-for, so there's no shame in taking a walk, getting a cup of coffee, whatever you need to do. Take your phone, take a deep breath, and take a break. You'll feel better for it, and that's great for your son, too \u2764\ufe0f", "That\u2019s the point. I think it\u2019s not just about the baby. It is about being supportive of YOU, his partner. You had been there all day and needed a break and emotional support.", "Of course he should go to the hospital. So it could easily be N T A. But if he reasonably believed he communicated his intentions, depending on how the information was exchanged, it could also be E S H. That is why I think it's hard to make it clear determination at the moment.", "THIS"]}
