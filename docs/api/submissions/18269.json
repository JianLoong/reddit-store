Awhile ago I asked my friend (f38) who was coming over to visit if she would model some for me for my website while she was over. She has modelled for me in the past when she\u2019s come over to visit.\nThis time however, she asked me if her daughter could be included in the photos. I politely explained that my *vibe/aesthetic* wasn\u2019t really \u201cmotherhood\u201d but actually maybe geared more towards independent women who choose not to be mothers, like myself. She should have understood this already based on ten years of friendship and five years of running my business.\nI said if course she could bring her daughter with her, I\u2019d just prefer not to have a child in the photos. She blew up at me and said I was being very anti-feminist by not including all types of women ie: mothers. I responded saying there was tons of \u201cmom-content\u201d, \u201cmotherhood\u201d representation out there and that I wanted my brand, my business, my creations to \u2026 not be that.\nShe didn\u2019t come over and now we\u2019re not speaking. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I gave her a simple answer and explanation at first but she dug in and demanded a more in depth reason why not. She argued with me. I was clumsy in my explanation and knew it at the time which has been reinforced by commenters here. I\u2019ve always found it difficult to explain what the *vibe* is in words.\nWhen I say independent- what I meant was independent of their identity of being a mother. I have tons of people who have modelled that are mothers- it\u2019s just not something that is emphasised in the branding.\nThe undies aren\u2019t like.. sexy sexy, but they\u2019re also not maternity.\nI have many friends who love to model for me in exchange for keeping what they wear. They like to help me out and get free stuff in return.

As a fellow business owner and mother, she's being ridiculous. Not every brand, product or content has to be full-spectrum inclusive.

Describing a vibe/aesthetic for underwear as \"not being motherhood\" is silly and sexist. As is the weird comment you can't be independent if you're a mother. There's no rule that says moms are only supposed to wear a certain type of underwear and vice versa.
