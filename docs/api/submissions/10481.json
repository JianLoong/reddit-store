Or had your kids since happy birthday. \n\nYou should have, in advance, at least had your kids make birthday cards. Low cost and low effort, but high in sentimentality. \n\nCards with heartfelt messages mean a lot. You were too lazy to even do that from the sounds of it. \n\nPresents don\u2019t have to be objects.

Not all families celebrate the same way or consider the same things gifts. And NO family is without issues. \n\nYour mom sounds passive aggressive. and those saying YTA seem to think having a child gives special rights to demand things from other adults? Since when is it ok to demand singing on your birthday? Because your the mother? And gifts? And keeping score of who does what for whom? \n\nHonestly she sounds exhausting.  I am a parent over 50 and expected nothing from my adult children because they do not owe me anything for raising them and I do not need them to validate my existence. \n\nAnd for the record dinner is in fact a gift, that is why restaurants sell GIFT cards for you bozos saying it\u2019s not a gift.", "Editing original comment bc I found the response to my question. \n\nI'm going to with NAH. Because in your comment to someone else you mention that your idea was to take her out to the super nice dinner as a birthday gift. Now things with the kids happened and plans fell through but then you offered to stick with the plan but on a different night but your mom chose plan B instead. I also think your mom is entitled to feel the way she feels although it might have been better said in person or over the phone rather than text.  With that said I think you should just apologize and let her know that you didn't intend to make her feel unconsidered.  And then maybe you make it up to her somehow.
