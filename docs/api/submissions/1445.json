So background, my mom just got engaged recently and I don\u2019t hate him or my new sister. I love them both a lot. We all are a family and I thought we all supported each other but then school started and I started noticing a pattern. If my brother needed to be picked up from football they would rush to pick him up, but if I needed a ride after theatre I had to walk home. If my other brother needed to be watched, I have to drop anything I had planned to watch him. My moms been to 4 of my shows out of the 20 I\u2019ve had but she\u2019s been to almost all of my brothers football games. I thought this was all in my head but then my sister talked to me and realized she had notice my parents not putting me first for literally anything. I guess you could say I feel abandoned and unimportant to them. Recently I\u2019ve been more mad at my parents because they told us my mom was pregnant which I\u2019m excited so much for them until they told what day the baby\u2019s due. My birthday is the due date. I\u2019m still so excited for baby to come but I know my 18th will now not be about me, which sounds selfish but it\u2019s the only time my family pays full attention to me instead of my siblings. If the baby\u2019s early then my parents will miss my graduation. I was feeling upset that again they might now be there to support me and when I brought this up to them calmly they yelled and told me I was being selfish and self-centered.

Your parents should care more about how you feel. Due dates are far from an exact science. More babies are born not on the due date than on it. Did you talk about the entire problem or just the baby thing? This whole thing needs to be brought up and I hope that your parents hear you <3", "NTA. I'm sorry this is happening to you. \n\nI will say the stuff about the baby is selfish, but it's understandable given the situation. \n\nThere's an established phenomenon where AFAB folks are often expected to do the \"good girl\" routine. This means putting other folks' wants and needs ahead of yours and being told you're selfish if you don't. I don't know if this is in play in a big way (ie your babysitting, no acknowledgement of your achievements) or if you're the Black Sheep now, but either way, not OK. \n\nSurround yourself with people who see you and value you. It sounds like your sister is a good ally, but you'll need more. \n\nYou're your own person. You deserve to be seen, loved and valued for that.", "Oh sweetie not the a-hole at all. If your step sister is noticing this too it\u2019s not all in your head. It sounds like to me that they like the boys better than the girls and thats really unfair. You should be loved just as much, they should pay just as much attention to you as they do your brother. I understand not everything can be 50/50 equal/fair because life is weird but they should try their hardest to be fair with everything to everyone. I would maybe get your sister to sit down with you and your parents and have a calm and reasonable discussion with them about what\u2019s been happening and hopefully they listen and take it to heart. If not your almost 18 and can leave.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid and need to be worked through. I would suggest maybe sitting down with your mom and trying to have an open conversation about them supporting your interests (theater, etc) and maybe sharing how excited you are about a new sibling but maybe requesting celebrating your graduation with your family early in case the baby is early and they can\u2019t be at the physical ceremony.", "NAH  - you aren't the asshole for your feelings.    But have you had a conversation with your mom about how you are feeling?   \n\nIt seems highly unlikely that they planned to conceive 9 months prior to your birthday, and due dates are not set in stone, but even if the baby arrives near your birthday there will be a lot of distraction.  Maybe you can suggest an early celebration.", "I'd say YTA. Have you talked to your mom about how you feel in a calm and rational way?", "Seems that she did (she said as much in her post) and was yelled at and called selfish. OP is NTA"]}
