Now, I absolutely did not have a problem with that because he deserves to spend time with his friends too ofc. \n\nBut my bf asked if I could put one of his shirts on, so I wouldn't be as exposed to his friends.

I go in his closet, and see that there's literally only hoodies. That's when I realized all his shirts were in the laundry, and usually laundry day for him is on weekends. His dorm is really hot so I was in no way gonna wear thick hoodies, and I compromised with him and said I'd just be under the blankets so they don't have to see anything. That's what I planned to do anyways because its really cozy and I was tired.  He was a bit reluctant but agreed nonetheless.\n\nHis friends came and they were having a good time video gaming. After a while,  I was thirsty and completely forgot that I was wearing a sports bra, and went to get water from his fridge. I drank a little bit, then went to the bathroom, and came back to the dorm to his bed. I didn't think much of it at the time, but after his friends left, my bf got mad and said that's why I should've worn his hoodie. I got into an argument with him and told him it really was not a big deal, and that they were prob so focused in their game that they didn't even see me. Plus, I was just wearing a sports bra, so its not like it was something really slutty.\n\nHe still doesn't agree with my reasoning so  AITA for not covering myself up like he wanted?", "created_utc": 1702140136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ehgnw/aita_for_not_covering_myself_up_when_my_bf/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
