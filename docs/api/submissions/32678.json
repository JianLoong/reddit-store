I was wearing a sports bra, and my bf's friends made a last minute plan to come over and play some games on his ps5. Now, I absolutely did not have a problem with that because he deserves to spend time with his friends too ofc.\n\nBut my bf asked if I could put one of his shirts on, so I wouldn't be as exposed to his friends. I was a little annoyed that I had to cover up, but I understood where he was coming from, because I'm fairly busty and it would just be an awkward environment for him and his friends. I go in his closet, and see that there's literally only hoodies. That's when I realized all his shirts were in the laundry, and usually laundry day for him is on weekends. His dorm is really hot so I was in no way gonna wear thick hoodies, and I compromised with him and said I'd just be under the blankets so they don't have to see anything. That's what I planned to do anyways because its really cozy and I was tired.  He was a bit reluctant but agreed nonetheless.\n\nHis friends came and they were having a good time video gaming. After a while,  I was thirsty and completely forgot that I was wearing a sports bra, and went to get water from his fridge. I drank a little bit, then went to the bathroom, and came back to the dorm to his bed. I didn't think much of it at the time, but after his friends left, my bf got mad and said that's why I should've worn his hoodie. I got into an argument with him and told him it really was not a big deal, and that they were prob so focused in their game that they didn't even see me. Plus, I was just wearing a sports bra, so its not like it was something really slutty.\n\nHe still doesn't agree with my reasoning so  AITA for not covering myself up like he wanted?\n\nEdit: I was there only for the night so didn't have my own shirts to wear because I expected to sleep in my sports bra and go back to my dorm today. I don't live with him. Its a single room college dorm. I came to his dorm wearing my own hoodie and a jacket.\n\nThe blanket is a thin sheet.
