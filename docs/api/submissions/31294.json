During my brothers funeral arrangements my moms boyfriends kids (16m) & (23f) were goofing around in the funeral directors office while everything was being laid out. I didn\u2019t really say much because I was still in shock & I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene. I\u2019m not sure if the matter was handled when they all went home but, I didn\u2019t dare ask because my mom had more important things to handle. Well two days after that we had the funeral service. As the preacher was giving the eulogy my moms boyfriends kids were sitting in the pew behind me. The whole entire time they were giggling & kicking our pew. I started to become very angry but, what really sent me over the edge was the fact that the (23f) was literally vaping while all of this went on. I stayed as calm as I could because causing a scene would have been disrespectful to my brother. I made note of the disrespect & that\u2019s something I can\u2019t forgive. A few weeks later my mom invited me to go bowling with all of them & I accepted because I wanted to spend some time with my mom & younger brother (17). While bowling the (23f) kept trying to talk to me & joke around with me. I flat out told that the disrespect her & her brother showed at my brothers funeral was unacceptable & that that\u2019s something that I can\u2019t & won\u2019t forgive so, she can stop trying to bond with me because it\u2019s never going to happen. I also told her that it\u2019s sad that my 6 year old son acted more mature then they did during the service. She left me alone after that but, what I\u2019m really worried about is ruining my relationship with my mom. I didn\u2019t tell my mom how they acted at the funeral & I\u2019m not sure if I should. Her boyfriend is her rock & he\u2019s doing everything to make sure my mom doesn\u2019t do something she will regret. I just really don\u2019t like her boyfriends kids & I know that eventually that will show.

This doesn't have to damage your mom's relationship, as the boyfriend, per your words, is doing everything he can to take care of your mom and you are able to remain civil.", "NTA. It\u2019s hard to believe that a 16 year old and 23 year old would be giggling and kicking the pew in front of them at a funeral. Were they extremely high? Or are they developmentally disabled?\n\nYou may want to mention to your mom that you\u2019re worried about their drug use, and give the example of their behavior at the funeral. Otherwise I would just steer clear of them. Sounds like you have your own family at this point and can maintain a separate relationship with your mom.", "NTA\n\nBut it may be better you tell your Mum rather than it coming via future step siblings Dad. They are bound to say something to him when he see's you keeping your distance, and the story will be their version and not necessarily the truth.\n\nWill your Mum be upset, probably, but the truth will out.", "I commend you for how you handled the situation while arrangements were being made, and at the service. Very mature. Now I suggest that you sit down and talk openly and honestly with your mother about the situation and how it made you feel so she can understand where you\u2019re coming from. And let her deal with her boyfriend and his kids. You also cannot expect them to feel the same way about your brother as you do. Unless they have been in your life for a long time, they are just not as connected. I know I goofed off a lot during funerals when I was younger, because I had no relationship with the person that died. I was just being dragged to the funeral. NTA.", "If her boyfriend is someone you trust, maybe you could talk to him.\n\nAnyway NTA the behaviour was appalling.", "You CANNOT be serious that someone was vaping and giggling during a funeral service?! Goddess take the Wheel! First of all, I am very,very, sorry for your loss. Secondly, I would have lost my fucking MIND. ABSOLUTELY NTA.", "NTA. Funerals are a time for mourning and paying respect, not for goofing around and being disrespectful. It's completely understandable that you're upset with their behavior. Taking time to grieve and heal is important, and it's okay to distance yourself from people who don't understand that. Your mom should be understanding of your feelings and prioritize your relationship over her boyfriend's kids. Sending you love and strength during this difficult time.", "NTA\n\nYou made your point and explained why. Their behaviour was inappropriate and immature. \n\nTell your mom everything. She needs to know. If there are family gatherings with your mom's and bf's families and you refuse to attend or there is tension, she needs to know the reason why.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you behaved with extraordinary restraint at the funeral saving your Mother from a scene. I wouldn\u2019t tell her unless their appalling behaviour comes up.", "Nta. I would speak to the boyfriend and let him handle his kids.", "i think you should tell her and her bf together. If he is a decent person (something only you know) he will be apalled at how his children behaved. Tho i wonder why he didn'T notice it. If i had behaved that way my mom would have discretely kicked me out of the service.", "NTA - Get your mom and her BF together and calmly explain why you\u2019d rather not be around his kids right now. Make sure to tell them this is all a very fresh wound. It may heal and it may not, but you\u2019d like their support while YOU grieve over the loss of your bro so very young. Being around them is not helping you do that right now.", "I want nothing more than to tell my mom because this has been weighing on me but, I don\u2019t know if now is the right time to even have that discussion. She\u2019s very fragile right now & I really don\u2019t want to add any extra stress on her.", "How young is \"younger\"? Under 10? These aren't 6-year-olds. They should know how to behave in public.", "regardless she should know before she finds out from another source", "Tell the boyfriend, if not your mother.  His kids to handle.  And he sounds like the sort to rain holy hell over this.", "Could you talk to her boyfriend about it?", "This. If your stepsiblings were as disruptive as you say during the funeral, people is going to talk. Also, she is bound to notice you don't want anything to do with them and you have no guarantees that they are not going to tell her about your rift in a worse way. Just be gentle. You know your mother; I am sure you will find a way to be compassionate and rely the information you need for the situation to be properly understood."]}
