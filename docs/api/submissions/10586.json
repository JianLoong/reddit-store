He's going to be defensive (I was at first) but you need to be clear about how you felt about his parent's comments. His reaction is everything. Like I said, he will defend them initially, but if he doesn't seem to understand why you are upset, or how those comments are inappropriate and won't even engage in a conversation about talking to his parents about them you need to understand one thing, he is ok with people saying those things to you. \n\nThen you have to ask yourself, are you OK with your spouse thinking those are things that his parents can say to you? Think long and hard on that one. \n\nI realized it wasn't ok for my mom to say the things that she said to my GF (now wife). I talked to my mom about it and she has over time been so much better (not perfect, but the effort is clear). Their relationship isn't great, but they have a relationship because of this.", "What the absolute fuck NTA", "NTA. In what world do you let your parents talk about your fianc\u00e9s weight/size, her breasts or your sex life without shutting it down? You shouldn\u2019t have had to ask to leave because he should have put a stop to it and already gotten you out of there. And then to defend it afterwords what an AH.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t do it. I promise you will find something better.", "NTA that is not typical \"banter\" if that family behaves that way to each other its good to set a boundary that you dont play that way", "This story sounds so in-the-face that I think its bullshit.", "OMG, girl, run like hell and don't look back! These people are horrible AHs and you are their punching bag.", "> all I am doing is making sure I never have any sort of relationship with his parents\n\nIn a situation like this I would've definitely made sure to not have any sort of relationship with any of them. The parents are creepy and the son is immature, and this is me trying to be kind with words. The father's comments reek of objectifying you, and judging by the post neither the mother nor the son did anything to stop him. I don't even want to look for possible explanation for their inaction.\n\nNTA, and I think you weren't dramatic enough over this.", "NTA He should have been defending you, or never subjected you to them at all.  You\u2019re not overreacting and it is not \u201clight banter\u201c.", "NTA. Him and his parents are the assholes.", "Who the fuck let's their parents shit all over their bride to be. What a bunch of assholes.", "NTA, but put your foot down. if you want to stay in this relationship, he and his family are gonna need to do a LOT to make up for the gross comments they made about you\u2014they objectifed you as nothing more than a sex object and when you were uncomfortable, your \"fiance\" told you to \"calm down\"? absolutely hell no. he didn't once stick up for you and this will be a common occurrence if you stay and he refuses to become any better. he and his family need to work on themselves, if not, that should be your deal breaker, hon. dont stay with someone who doesnt value you or sticks up for you.", "Bfs parents bully you all dinner and then bf defends their behavior. No one deserves to be treated like that. Thats a bad apple and bad trees.", "NTA, but you should rethink this relationship. My husband would NEVER have stood for that kind of intrusive, ignorant commentary, let alone expected me to sit there and politely endure it. Your fianc\u00e9 failed to intervene on your behalf. Worse, he minimized his parent\u2019s outrageous behavior and \u201cscolded\u201d you for refusing to submit to their bizarre interrogation. It\u2019s a very bad sign that he allowed other people to disrespect you, but it\u2019s unforgivable that he\u2019s attempting to punish you for respecting yourself.", "His parents are horrible but your fiance is so much worse -- for minimising their appalling behaviour *and* failing to defend you. \n\nDo you still want to be subjected to this in your 40s, or do you reckon they will have bantered the resistance out of you by then? If his father is allowed to be like this, what kind of father will your fiance make? Gross.\n\nNTA, but you will be the AH to yourself if you allow for a relationship with this little respect continue.", "NTA. Why would you be with a jerk who gaslights you about your feelings? Especially with the totally inappropriate comments his parents made. Your feelings were valid under the circumstances. Think very carefully on whether you want to put up with this kind of verbal abuse. Because it isn't going to get better. Only worse.", "NTA This is like the start of a horror movie. \n\nGirl meets nice guy, falls in love, gets engaged. Finally meets the family. Turns out they're creepy freaks. On the wedding night she realises she has to take part in the family ritual. Stripped naked and hunted through the family estate.\n\nOk it's obviously not that bad but they are creepy freaks and your partner is on their side even at this early stage. It will not get better.", "NTA but comments are kinda wrong imo. I mean he knew his parents are Rocky, so he grew up being in this abusive situation. For him this is normal. Sure you can dump him and he should defend you. But you could and should show him better.", "NTA. I know this is a super Reddit thing to say but when I say it I truly mean it - leave him. \n\nYou are not overreacting and you are not being dramatic. Your fianc\u00e9s parents overstepped your boundaries repeatedly after you told them to stop and your fianc\u00e9 not only did nothing to support you but invalidated your feelings. That\u2019s never going to change. \n\nYou\u2019re young and you deserve to be with someone who respects and appreciates you. Don\u2019t settle for someone who allows you to be bullied.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are AHs and so is your fianc\u00e9 for not defending you and enabling their behavior. I\u2019d leave him if I were you", "Yta because it\u2019s not your ex fianc\u00e9 at the time of posting.  Time to put them big titties back on the market", "You forgot don\u2019t look back.", "This is why my partner doesn't talk to his dad. He made a few racist comments in front of me. I reminded him that his own granddaughter is half Jamaican and that some of my closest friends are Indians, he got himself a bit of a shambles. My partner told him it was probably time to go and they haven't spoken since. \n\nI also understand that my partner and parents don't see eye to eye, but they also haven't said anything like that to him, so I still see them and talk to them, but I don't force him to. If he wants to tag along, he can, of he doesn't, he doesn't. \n\nWe work together as a unit. That's how it's supposed to work. If he isn't sticking up for OP, he's not worth her time."]}
