If this is how they speak to someone they\u2019ve only just met, I don\u2019t want to know what they are like when they get to know you better.  No, OP, don\u2019t ever go back to that house, none of that is OK.", "Nta but give the guy an ultimatum you shouldn't have to put up with that. But it should be told that it doesn't feel right to have those discussions about physical appearance what if that was dished out to them would they be offended? There are ways to deal with this and figure out if the family you are joining is going to be a healthy relationship for you.", "Do not marry that man. NTA", "NTA full stop and I'd  honestly reconsider marrying a man that condones that kind of behavior from family. It was sexist and it was bullying.", "NTA your fianc\u00e9 has shown you his true colors and his idea of respect among family members. You\u2019d better believe him and start running away", "Run and run hard. You\u2019d be marrying into a family of a*holes.", "\u201call I am doing is making sure I never have any sort of relationship with his parents\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t threaten me with a good time.", "Nta. If you marry him and he doesn't do anything to change their behavior, then you'll be in touch with these people all of the time.", "You're ENGAGED and only just meeting his kin? \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nI would absolutely say nope to this dope. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You just got a glimpse of what your future will be like if you marry this man: a lifetime of him taking his parents' side over yours, even if they make wildly inappropriate remarks about your breasts and sex life. This family sounds like a nightmare. Run, girl.", "You are NTA, but your fianc\u00e9 and his parents are for how they all treated you.  Their whole family sounds gross and if I were you, I'd be heading for the hills.", "NTA  \n\n\nDo not mary into this family, your life will be hell.  \nImagine if ytou had kids with this guy and these people treat you this way ALREADY and your fiance thinks what they say is fine.  \n\n\nYou are 23, run the fuck away, hell even if you were 50, run the fuck away.", "I'm sorry, he is still your fiance? I know this is the most popular answer on this subredit, but how on earth you imagine marrying into this family?\n\nEven if you are not going to interact much, you will have them in your life. Imagine if you decide having kids. Would you want them to be exposed to this?\n\nWhen I brought my first serious boyfriend home, my mom asked me 'are you comfortable to be with this mans' family? If your guts say you should leave, listen to it. It will not get better. '", "NTA.  Dump this man and all those red flags.  Not only has he not backed you up or spoken up for you, but he's also taking their side.  You can do better and do not want to breed with this person and have his family forever taking jabs at your or the kids.  Run.", "NTA. \n\nEven IF we assume that his parents weren't intentionally being bullies (which is a big if) those are some tacky as hell questions, especially for the first time they met someone! And once you started showing signs of distress, they should have backed off and apologized. \n\nIt's a good thing if you 'never have any sort of relationship with his parents' because they sound pretty trashy. But they aren't the problem. Your fiance wanting you to put up with this and demeaning how you feel about it is the issue. I would HIGHLY recommend resolving this issue before moving forward with the wedding, if you choose to move forward at all. \n\nYou're not being dramatic. Your fiance is the one that isn't taking this seriously enough.", "NTA\n\nOr how dare you set actual boundaries of what you will or will not tolerate. \n\nHindsight is 20/20 because you could have answered with something like \"It's a good thing that I'm not HR, or I would be lecturing you on sexual harassment/preparing for a law suit because of you.\"", "It's so confusing to see these types of posts where 1. OP is clearly not the AH but can't seem to see it, and 2. OP completely missing the actual point, that the fiance is a piece of work, tailor made from the same cloth as the parents!!\n\nI hope OP cuts him lose now before it's too late. This gaslighting and bullying sounds like a very torturous way to live with for the rest of my life.", "If you break it off you give it back you don't pawn it.", "You can tell this commenter is most definitely the type of person to go apeshit when someone makes a joke at their expense.", "Link?", "Don\u2019t assume my gender because of my handle.", "You are sensitive. Try to roll with it because maybe it was said in a light joking manner. They may not know that you aren\u2019t into light teasing and are easily offended...", "I love how they said nothing about your gender but you assumed that was the point they were making. Shoe, meet foot.", "NTA\n\n>telling me all I am doing is making sure I never have any sort of relationship with his parents\n\nWell, thank FUCK for that!\n\nYour fiance sees nothing wrong with how his parents treated you. Think back to that dinner and ask yourself if you want that to be the rest of your life, because it will be if you marry him and he continues to defend them", "NTA But your fianc\u00e9s and his parents are definitely AHs. RUN!!!", "NTA and I hope the next update is \"ex-fianc\u00e9\" because it is only going to get worse, not better", "NTA\n\nPlease take this as a warning.  They were saying absolutely disgusting things and your fiance was not only fine with it, he told you that YOU were in the wrong and dismissed your legitimate upset as you just \"being emotional\".\n\nHe has shown you what a future with him will look like.  He will throw you under the bus to please his cruel parents and make you feel like the bad guy to manipulate you into giving in.  He's exposed his true face to you and shown you where his priorities are.  It doesn't matter what awful things that say to you in the future or how they treat you, he's made it clear that expects you to have a relationship with them regardless if you stay with him.\n\nYou were not wrong to leave the dinner, but you need to see that his behavior is inexcusable.  If he's unwilling to understand how he and his family were wrong and you stay with him, you are likely signing up for a future filled with verbal abuse.  Once you're married, I wouldn't be surprised if he started talking to you the same way his parents do because it would be harder for you to escape the relationship.", "NTA but don\u2019t marry this man! He didn\u2019t stand up for you AT ALL and let his parents bulldoze you with a barrage of insults. You deserve so much better OP", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 has shown who he truly is. He will always treat you badly. Leave him", "NTA, I, a random stranger, is begging you not to marry this man.", "NTA But don't marry him. He doesn't have your back, and he thinks what they did was ok.", "NTA. Dude I get thin shamed all the time for how tiny I am. It\u2019s really annoying. Usually it\u2019s by people who are over weight. I eat pretty damn healthy and exercise because I feel like crap if I don\u2019t. \u201cOh so you\u2019re just one of those girls that just doesn\u2019t eat aren\u2019t you?\u201d Was a comment a woman at the bingo table said to me recently. She was overweight and eating a chili dog and I just said \u201cI\u2019m sorry? I exercise and eat healthy and that food would make me feel like crap\u201d she immediately apologized and my fianc\u00e9 notices this happens to me and he gets frustrated with it. Why are they talking about your tits and asking about your sex life. That\u2019s just gross and embarrassing. Pretty sure my SO would\u2019ve gotten up and left before me as to not subject me to that. Just a word of caution i was engaged to someone who\u2019s parents had no boundaries and he would always back them up because again he also wasn\u2019t taught boundaries. My problem is I stayed so long because I have pretty thick skin. It doesn\u2019t get better and I doubt he\u2019s going to find someone who thinks that kind of table talk is acceptable.", "NTA - your fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents treated you horribly and your fianc\u00e9 defended this behavior.  kind of odd, considering he warned you about them in advance.  I guess he forgot to warn you about himself?\n\non the bright side, it's not too late to break off this engagement.  you deserve better.", "ughh you're not being dramatic, you're still young enough- please don't marry this wet noodle and be tied to his wet noodle family", "NTA - I\u2019d back out of the engagement. From personal experience (M,34) my ex wife\u2019s parents and I had issues and ultimately played a role in the marriage ending. Unless he\u2019s going NC which I highly doubt, this will only carry on and continue being a problem.", "What will you do or ehat will he do when they start criticizing children you may have? Get out of there now, he's not worth it nta", "Nta.", "NTA. I\u2019m hoping you mean ex-fianc\u00e9.", "NTA but run. He defended them when you noted you're uncomfortableness. Fucking run gf.", "Ew. Give the ring back and count ur blessings u saw this side of him before the wedding. NTA", "NTA, it\u2019s not light banter, and if he doesn\u2019t defend you/ support you setting a boundary that\u2019s your signal to leave.\nIf he doesn\u2019t condemn that attitude, he\u2019s lenient and/or will soon join in. (Serious wtf vibes)\nStand your ground.", "I know not everyone wants kids but, OP, would you be comfortable with all of these people one day speaking to your future children this way? Or to your family? It's extremely inappropriate towards you and I'm not trying to take from that, I just sometimes need to look at things from a different perspective, removing myself from the equation. Every one of these comments are disgusting. And this was your first time meeting them! Imagine how much worse it could get! \n\nNTA", "NTA, but consider the family you'd be marrying into, and then add some years on top of that. Do you want children? If so, imagine your FIL or MIL making comments about them as they start to hit puberty (definitely had friends' grandparents who would do this). If you get pregnant, I'm sure you'll hear even more comments about your body, ESPECIALLY as it relates to your husband rather than yourself as your own person. \n\nReally think about the implications of marrying into a family where the in laws feel like they can comment freely, and your potential husband just excusing their behavior instead of having your back like he should.", "JUST RUN.  YOUR SOON TO BE HUBBY OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT CARE THAT YOU WERE BEING INSULTED.  THINK OF WHAT YOU WILL HAVE TO GO THRU AFTER MARRIAGE AND KIDS.  WHAT IF THEY DO THIS TO YOUR FUTURE CHILDREN?  SOMETIMES LOVE IT NOT ENOUGH.", "Your bf and his parents are AH. They are beyond rude, they insulted you,  they have poor social skills but your real problem is your BF. He let them behave like this and insisted on you having your dinner even if he knew you that you were annoyed and feeling uncomfortable. He will never stand up for you and in any case he will prioritize his parents. Do you see a future with him? Are you OK with this?", "NTA! Run girl, run! Give the ring back or pawn it, but don\u2019t marry that guy!", "Oof. NTA but take a long, hard look at your potential future with this man and his parents. He is excusing their behaviour as \"rocky\" when it's sexist and insulting. And called you \"emotional\" when you stepped away. He's not on your side for this argument, which doesn't bode well", "NTA but girl. Be so serious. Why are you marrying that man?", "NTA but come on. Have a couple of glasses of wine and throw that \"banter\" right back at them. You are marrying into their family. They are \"rocky\" people. Best put on some thick skin and stop running away. Being annyoed is one thing. Acting that ridiculously fragile is another. Especially when it will harm the rest of your relationship with your inlaws. Which also harms your husband and his relationship with his parents. Mission failed.", "I\u2019m not okay with my boundaries being disrespected, but I still have no idea how to handle the situation because him and I have been together for many years", "I don\u2019t drink. And I\u2019m not going to accept sexually charged \u201cbanter\u201d and borderline verbal abuse", "Wow, way to throw the insults at OP. She doesn't need to have a thick skin when she's being sexually degraded by her would-be FIL. She hasn't harmed the relationship with them, the onus is also on the parents not to act like trash, which is exactly what they did when they began commenting on her body. They were entirely out of bounds. OP is NTA.", "These types of posts are usually posted by people that have been gaslit into believing they are in the wrong when they are the actual victim.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Lol yep look at their other responses to my and other comments. Absolute hypocrite", "This.

Actually, I\u2019m rather amused.", "What was the reference to my handle? Can you explain it to me like I\u2019m 5? What was being inferred? What did he mean then? Cowards are never straightforward.
