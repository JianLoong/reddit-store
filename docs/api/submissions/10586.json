At that point I was a little annoyed, but I let it slide. The comments continued throughout the dinner, then my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom decided to join in, making comments about my weight and asking how much my boob job cost because \u201csomeone so small could never naturally have such large breasts\u201d. So I nudged my fianc\u00e9 that I wanted to leave, and he told me to relax. His dad starts asking about our sex life, telling my fianc\u00e9 how lucky he is and that he better \u201cmake the most of it before I get old and don\u2019t want sex anymore\u201d. I got up after that and went to the bathroom so I could cool down, and while I was in the bathroom, my fianc\u00e9 starts talking to me through the door, asking me to come out and have dinner and not be so emotional over what he called light banter, which upset me even more. I came out of the bathroom and told my fianc\u00e9s parents that I was leaving because I couldn\u2019t handle the barrage of insults and bullying when I just wanted to have dinner. Now all day today my fianc\u00e9 has been scolding me and telling me all I am doing is making sure I never have any sort of relationship with his parents, and I\u2019m feeling like I may have been dramatic over this.", "created_utc": 1677030979, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118lsuy/aita_for_snapping_on_my_fianc\u00e9s_parents_at_dinner/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's fine with that? He's siding with them?", "NTA.\n\nIf I was you, I'd be seriously reconsidering my relationship with this man. Both of his parents stepped way over normal social boundaries in pretty much any culture. Commenting on your body is a no. Asking how much you paid for a boob job is no, for many reasons. Asking about someone else's private sex life -- especially your child -- is a huge no!! Giving people unsolicited sex advice is a no.\n\nThese people are vile. So much that I have to wonder if they were *trying* to put you off. Or if this entire thing is a fabrication. \n\nIt would be bad enough if they behaved this way and your boyfriend comforted you and apologized and promised to speak to them. But he didn't! He tried to blame you for not just taking it. Can you have a relationship with a man who doesn't support you enforcing very normal boundaries in a very polite way? A man who succeeds in making you question your own sanity in this situation? And if so, can you be happy having in-laws like this? Because he's probably not going to cut them out of his life for you if he's defending their egregious behavior and pretending you're the problem.", "NTA\n\nRUN FAST AND DON'T LOOK BACK. If your fianc\u00e9 is ok with his parents asking such questions and making such disrespectful comments, then you need to leave FAST. That is so appalling. Especially since they didn't apologize and your fianc\u00e9 is excusing their behavior as 'normal'", "NTA\n\nHis parents, during one meal, made sure they would not have any relationship with you.\n\nLet\u2019s put the blame where it belongs.", "\u201cwhen someone shows you who they are, believe them.\u201d \n\nNTA\n\nIt will only get worse.

Their comments were wildly inappropriate, it wasn't \"light banter\", it was rude and you shouldn't have to put up with it.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019d have serious concerns about him after seeing how he let his parents act with you. Not once did he shut down their weird, creepy and insulting behavior. This isn\u2019t light banter. It\u2019s harassment.", "He doesn't think there's anything wrong with this. He may never think this is wrong. Maybe think twice, or even 3 times, before you marry him.\n\nNTA", "Your fiance probably shouldn't be your fiance. This will be your life for the rest of ever. Horrible in laws who make inappropriate comments about your body and life and a husband who has no spine and thinks it's okay to talk to people like that. Let alone people you've just met (this is their best behavior it'll only get worse) and in public. You weren't over dramatic at all.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you also just found out what kind of person your fiance actually is, and it isn't pretty.  \nHe's essentially showing that he does not care if his family berates or belittles you, He will not stand up for you, in fact - He'll make you feel like it's your fault.  \nOP - Lets be honest, Do you REALLY want to spend your life with someone like this?", "NTA\n\nDo they say those things to their waitress? Grocery store clerks? The office receptionist? I doubt it. Therefore, why should you be demeaned in such a way? My parents nor my partner's parents have ever commented upon our endowments, bodies, or sex lives. Even if one or the other's family were the no-holds-barred types, I can't envision any of that coming up in the first meeting.", "NTA but your fiance is showing you his true colors if sexual harassment is what he considers \u201clight banter\u201d\u2026 Run!\n\nIf he knows it upset you and also chose to gaslight you instead of defending you then double run.", "NTA.  Huge red flags for a lifetime of insults.  Your boundaries are fair and valid and good for you for standing your ground.   Your finance should \ud83d\udcaf have your back in this - you may want to think long and hard about what this behavior will do to you long term.", "NTA\n\nIm small too, and people always feel the need to comment on how I eat.  I hated it.\n\nThey we\u2019re rude and their behavior was unacceptable.  One or two comments, I\u2019d say bite your tongue and see what happens next time.  But the boob job comment, then talking about your sex life, just gross.\n\nYoure right in being upset and standing up for yourself.  This is a big deal for you and your fiance to straighten out.  You have a life time of dealing with his parents ahead of you.  Make sure you get those issues resolved before wedding planning starts.  This is not something to pretend it will magically get better once you\u2019re married", "NTA, and because of his reaction to their completely inappropriate behavior, I would think long and hard about spending my life with this person.", "NTA\n\nInappropriate, obnoxious \u201cbanter\u201d that is sexually charged is not ok. How awful.", "NTA - that\u2019s comically inappropriate on their part, if true. Probably better to have called them on it and asked them to stop as a first step, but I don\u2019t blame you.", "NTA. Things like weight and sex life are not what I would call \"light banter.\" Good for you for leaving. If it continues, continue to send the message that you won't tolerate insults like that, from his parents or from him.", "NTA \n\nI don't usually jump to - break off the relationship, but if this is what his parents think is appropriate behaviour, and how your fianc\u00e9 reacts to your not submitting to being insulted and bullied- what's going to happen once you're married? Or if you should choose to have children. Their behaviour is not acceptable, will not improve, and your fianc\u00e9  is  not only okay with them treating you this way, but clearly is supporting their BS, and telling you to accept it.  Think about how much you want your life to be THIS!  Don't let people devalue you, and know you don't deserve that treatment.", "NTA. You were sexually harassed by your fianc\u00e9s parents and he not only refused to stand up for you, but scolded you for getting upset about it. Let please let that sink in and reconsider marrying this man.", "NTA. The only correct response to rude comments is to state \u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201d I\u2019m a firm believer that rude people have to be called out on their behavior, or they will continue to behave poorly. Also, your fianc\u00e9 needs to stick up for you. Do make that clear to him.", "NTA. seriously if your fianc\u00e9 is just fine with you being insulted by his parents, you might need to rethink your relationship with him", "NTA. \n\nRun. Please leave this relationship.", "NTA Not having any sort of relationship with the inlaws? I think they did that themselves.", "NTA. Run. He will never defend you. He will accept this as normal. He will likely join in. You need to either be prepared to take this for a long time until they are dead or find someone with a family who actually respects you -- or a partner who actually defends you.\n\nThere is no need to marry this family when you are only 23.", "NTA \n\nwhy do you want to marry someone that is okay with you being disrespected?", "nta. please turn your fianc\u00e9 into an ex", "Anyone who asks you about or asks your partner about your private life is not an individual worthy of your time. Your fianc\u00e9 was making excuses for them and you need to investigate that a bit. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  This dinner was a clue of what you will be in for if you marry this man.
