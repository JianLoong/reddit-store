She doesn\u2019t care about people and their opinions bc they\u2019re \u201ctoo much noise\u201d. I find myself getting into men drama as I cant seem to judge character and she has helped. \n \n2days ago, we were in uni and a guy sat next to me. I start chatting to him& when she comes, I can tell she\u2019s annoyed.  She sits down, crosses her arms and tuts loudly. Me& the guy laugh awkwardly but keep talking &he asks for my number. My friend abruptly says \u201cshe\u2019s not interested, go away\u201d. He looks irritated& says \u201cI was asking her\u201d. She says \u201ctake a hint, bitch boy\u201d. I step in &nudge her saying he\u2019s being nice and for her to chill. The guy just says \u201cok? Wtf?\u201d She says \u201cthat\u2019s all they all  do, fucking horny apes\u201d. He\u2019s looks annoyed. After a bit, I apologise &he leaves.\n\nI was pretty annoyed& say that I can tell a guy myself if Im not interested. She says \u201cyou can never say no\u201d. I tell her she\u2019s rude but she says that she\u2019s just honest. I say there\u2019s a difference between honest &being a plain bitch. She is fuming and says \u201cdid you just call me a bitch\u201d. I say \u201cthat\u2019s what you were acting like\u201d.\n\nShe starts screaming that idk what it\u2019s like, I always get everything I want, I have pretty privilege, I can eat what I want (she is overweight). I sympathise with her and go to hug her, but she pushes me &says \u201cstop trying to act like the nice girl all the time\u201d.I get annoyed &say \u201clisten, I know you\u2019re upset but you don\u2019t have a right to be mean to me. I\u2019m just trying to help\u201d.\n\nShe gets angry& in my face and stars shouting sl**, that If men could see past looks, they\u2019d prefer her over bc I\u2019m fake, I love attention& making her look like shit and that I get with multiple guys&I\u2019m not mature enough to handle them (this is hurtful bc she knows some of them were ab*sive or forceful). In the end, she said I had nothing to offer but my face and body.\n\n I am crying &she says \u201csave the tears.Your life has given you nothing to cry about. Try being considered ugly for a day\u201d.\n\nI scoff &say \u201cyou being \u201cugly\u201d is not my problem so stopping making it mine. Guys don\u2019t come to you-not because of your weight, face, it\u2019s because you\u2019re a fucking asshole\u201d. She just keeps repeating \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that\u201d crying. I leave. I tell my friends; they\u2019re annoyed& ignore her saying they weren\u2019t too fond of her anyways.\n\nYday, I got a long text accusing me of turning our friends against her& saying I\u2019m petty. She says she opened up and I used it against her. I ignored her text but my sister said that I was an asshole as my friend was obviously insecure& deeply upset about something but I didn\u2019t comfort her.

Finally a different friend told me that if that is how is she is, why would I want to get used to it? It Finally clicked that she would try to distance all my other friends and monopolize all my time to only be focused on her, and would do everything she could to isolate me. She ended up dating my brother, made him go NC with me for almost 2 years before he also woke up to how manipulative she was.

I am what you would call above average in the looks department, I am truly not trying to brag or be conceited, it is just relevant to what I'm trying to say. I had a friend when I was 17, Emma. Emma was a cute girl, blonde, 5'2, pretty eyes etc very girl next door. We became friends and after about a month or so, I noticed that anytime I would say something with the slightest hint of a complaint (example: I have a bit of a headache and im feeling kind of sick)  her response was always \"oh please, your life is so easy with your pretty privilege, youll be fine\" things that didn't even make sense. I wasn't allowed to ever say that I didn't like something about my appearance, wasn't allowed to make any comments about liking boys because it wasn't fair to her, if i was feeling sad about something I should just \"get over it, your life is so easy when you're pretty, what do you have to be sad about.\"\n\nIt got to a point where I hated being around her. She would always complain that no boys liked her because as soon as they saw me, they didn't care about her, but it was actually her personality plus her hatred towards men that turned them off almost immediately after meeting her when she would be fake crying about how ugly she is and men never give her attention, only me. It was truly exhausting. It got to a point that I would literally not wear makeup around her and dress in sweats so she would stop hurling insults at me. We had to finish the year at school together, but after that, I didn't really hear from her much nor did I reach out. \n\nI know that she is still single 11 years later and pretty miserable. It makes me sad for her, she pushed everyone away with her horrible attitude and now she's paying the price. \n\nAnyway, you are definitely not the asshole in this situation, and If you can , I would cut contact with her immediately. Her jealousy will only grow and start to affect your mental health because she'll likely get more and more aggressive with you over time. I'm sorry you have to put up with that, it's not a good time.\n\nBest of luck OP\u2764", "Holy shit, with friends like her who needs enemies. You are totally NTA.", "NTA.

But honestly, she's just barely one given the whole context of the situation. Because I suspect that about 90% of what she said about you is true, by your own (reluctant) admission.\n\nI won't victim blame and say that it's your fault that you've had abusive or otherwise predatory partners. But you're unequivocally an AH because you openly admit that you not only KNOW that you have terrible judgement when it comes to men, but (and you clearly have sought to downplay this as much as possible) that she has \"helped you\" . . . which means one of two things:\n\n*Either you've depended on her repeatedly to get you out of bad situations in the past, or you have asked her repeatedly to help you avoid problematic men/situations because you are aware of your own shitty judgement.*\n\nGiven that truth, you're a massive AH because **you've put her in a no-win situation**. You insist on making your problems her problems, and treating her like your personal therapist/bodyguard to protect you from your own poor choices . . . but in the moment, when she actually tries to do that for you, you are utterly shitty to her. You treat her like a nosy, intrusive PITA; you insult her openly; you act like you don't know why she's interfering . . . even though you know perfectly well that she's the one who's going to be picking your crying ass up off the floor when it all goes wrong. And when she calls you on your shit, you take the side of whichever rando you're trying to flirt with.\n\nAnd the worst part is, she's not even judging you. YOU are the one who says you have poor judgement and rely on her. She's just trying to what you ask of her. YTA for being two-faced, exhausting, and generally just not a good friend to her. Don't ask for help and then be rude when you get it.", "ESH. Why are you two friends? You are awful to each other.", "NTA. She\u2019s sounds exhausting.", "Why are you all friends? ESH", "You probably didn't need to call her \"ugly\" as that is very subjective anyway, but she just seems a bit toxic. Even though we are hearing your side of the story she just sounds very negative and just plain rude. Maybe she has a crush on you but I don't think you were an asshole here, you just rose to the bait when she was looking for a fight and she came off second best.

Your friend called you shallow, threw your trauma in your face, practically blamed you for every single one of her faults.

Also, you'd think your mother would care more about looking out for yourself, not another woman who makes you out to be the bad guy in her life. Her issue isn't being overweight or not good-looking.

First off, I'm a white man in America so it's just not an option and also, I know how to handle my shit.\"\n\nExcept he'd then go and be the most abusive shit-heel I've ever met and now I need therapy for being friends with him.\n\nSo when someone says they don't need therapy, they're mistaken.", "She's young & she can get services through your university most likely. Also it's not your job to fix someone or be someone's emotional punching bag. You need to think about your self-care first vs. Make apologies for her bad behavior. Many people have crap circumstances that come up in their life and they still choose not to be horrid people. NTA", "honey, she showed you her true colors with the terrible way she treated you. she is jealous of you. you do not deserve a person literally seething with jealousy in your life, especially one that will treat you HORRIBLY at the first chance she gets. that is not a friend.", "Story time:\n\nI had a *terrible* friend throughout high school and college. She was so rude and awful, and everyone I knew absolutely hated her. But I kept her in my life because we had been friends for so long. I even considered her my \u201cbest\u201d friend because of that. But she was so insufferable and toxic!! \n\nSpecifically, she was extremely self-centered. Whenever we would get together or talk on the phone, she would talk for *hours and hours* about herself, without taking any breaks, usually just complaining endlessly about other people. She never cared about what was happening in my life, even after I moved away and we saw each other less. Never asked how I was doing, never listened when I shared good news, always quickly changed the subject when I tried to talk about a challenge or hardship I was experiencing.\n\nOne day, my boyfriend of many years asked me why I still put up with her crap.\n\nI said \u201cbecause she\u2019s not always terrible, sometimes she\u2019s there for me and has been by my side during tough times.\u201d\n\nHe then said something that changed my life: \u201cthat\u2019s just how selfish people are. They give a little so they can take a lot.\u201d\n\nOP, this person was never your friend. I\u2019m sorry. She was using you because everyone else refused to put up with her shit. You are doing her no favours by allowing her to abuse your good nature.\n\nI\u2019m glad to hear you ended your friendship. Don\u2019t doubt yourself and remember that you should not feel guilty. You did the right thing, and she has the ability to be less of an AH if she doesn\u2019t like being lonely.", "Oh honey,  narcissists can be great friends and do nice things but be rest assured they are counting then up as chits to call or for favours in return and to make you feel obliged.  They can see that in your nature. Especially if you're a kind soul and don't like being in any type of debt to people. Been there.", ">She has a funny stance against boys? She says she hates them but has had a lot of crushes which I have tried helping her with but to no avail.\n\nOP, I grew up with lots of guy friends because I was a major tomboy. I knew girls like this and this is my take, but maybe she 'hates' them because she's rejecting them first before they could reject her? I think it's some sort of defense mechanism to make her feel better that she wasn't interested in them first so it doesn't matter if they liked her or not.\n\nAt this point, I think you're better off cutting her off. I get that she has good and bad times but everyone does. Please don't try to justify her bad behavior by saying that the small semblance of good is worth it. You'll find much better support with your true friends than someone who is just trying to keep you beneath them.", "I wasn't saying you were, i apologize if it came off like that. It was more of like a reminder even if I think you wouldn't do that. I know you weren't, I think she has some work to do with her self-esteem, and I think honestly she was using it to be an ass to you and to try and get away with it. Either way, you don't have to be around her if she is acting like that. I'm very much on your side about this", "As someone who has been on both sides, pretty priveledge absolutely exists. When you are too plain, people see right through you passing by, like you don't exist. They deal with you in a very basic minimalist way.\n\nWhen you are pretty, especially thin and pretty, more people (men and women) pay attention to you. They are more likely to go out of their way to help you. They are kinder and smile more.\n\nMy sister says when she goes out to eat, regardless of the restaurant, she gets better service when she has her hair and makeup done.", "I used to be like that. I've learned to smile appreciatively and kindly while saying \"No, but thank you for asking. Have a great day! \ud83d\ude42\" Then turn away and move on. \n\nThis has been very successful for me.", "My experience was pretty fine in boot camp, but friends I made in those few weeks often would have break downs. I'm good at following orders despite being kind of a \"free spirit\" most of the time. I knew what was going on around me and I acted accordingly. The friends I saw break didn't realize what they were getting into and were sold on the experience being like call of duty or some stupidity. Our TI was a woman, and a fairly attractive one. She knew she had to be harder/meaner than normal and she was. The experience hit each of us differently. I don't look at brunettes the same, even nearly 20 years later.", "Genuinely asking, we're you abused or in abusive situations growing up?\n\nI found basic training to be significantly easier and better than my home life, but grew up in an abusive household. Not saying that's why you didn't find it too intense, but might be why", "I hate that word too, so much.", "What she's doing is called blackmail, and the fact that she went straight to blackmail is proof you did the right thing in telling her to kick rocks. It sucks because she's going to do an extinction burst of absolutely any kind of unhinged behavior she can manage to get you back under her thumb, but stay strong!! Take it from a former doormat who had way too many of these friendships before I finally learned my lesson; it will never get better, and if she knows she can cow you with this, she'll just escalate every time she senses you pulling away. Do yourself a favor, and take the hit now, and not down the road when it's worse.", "Don't tell the male friend ahead of time of you don't want to. So what, you had a crush. I know it seems like a big deal, but it isn't at all. I've had a crush on colleagues, friends, husbands of friends... And I'm super happily married. It's TOTALLY normal.\n\nIf he hears or asks, tell him \"yes I did in the past, you're a good friend and attractive. That's over and am thrilled we're friends.\" That happens in adult relationships all the time. But... Just be prepared... It's how I met my husband\ud83e\udd23", "Omg don\u2019t apologise loool, you\u2019re so sweet. I completely get what you were saying. I am just saying that I would never do that. Thanks for the comment!", "I don\u2019t deny that it exists, just that I have never experienced it. Or, if I have, I don\u2019t know what that entails. So exactly why I would love to hear about it from both sides yk", "I feel like to an extent it does exist, but also there is a level of intimidation that comes along with it when it comes to interpersonal relationships just like OP is experiencing. OP did NOTHING wrong by talking to this guy and treating everyone with kindness. Now, her friend over reacted due to her own insecurities and it shows. What does she expect OP to do go Mar her face? People do experience pretty privileges on a superficial level, but also makes it hard to have genuine connections with people as they are constantly comparing themselves to friend, or BF might feel insecure because they may feel as if they aren't good enough, even if the person who just happens to be beautiful is completely loyal etc. So I see both sides.", "Omg I need to learn this, even thinking of it makes me anxious lol. My friends have said I need to stop being a pushover so", "Boot camp is designed to brutally brainwash recruits as quickly as possible to make them drones with little individual thought. It is absolutely not about being able to handle the stress of war, but fitting in and not questioning the impositions of killing others. \n\nIt is a function of the use of military forces to support capitalistic endeavors. \n\nCountries would be much better off learning to control the big bucks that want war, than focusing on abusing young adults for profit.", "I have the opposite problem. My parents are loud people. Often yelling just to communicate. Yelling has basically no effect on me, I'm basically conditioned to just ignore someone whos yelling till they stop because it annoyed me so much as a kid. I only ever had one boss who would yell and I remember the lower level managers would crack up whenever he would yell at me. One time I said \"I cant understand you when you yell like that\" after he had a huge blow up and went on this 3 minute rant. One of them had to leave the office to hide his laughter.", "I really like this!", "Repeat after me: \u201cyou are not emotional support animal to her\u201d.\n\nHad similar \u201cfriend\u201d like this. He came from not great family/living situation and he kept putting me down to make him feel better and I tolerated it. It ended up with him stealing from me quite expensive electronics \u201cbecause you don\u2019t need it\u201d and threatening me with violence when I went to get it back. Had to involve police and prosecutor to get it back and he now has criminal record.\n\nLeave before it could turn into even crazier story.", "A part of being mature is also realising that you can't be responsible for someone else's happiness and security. That girl has MAJOR deep seated insecurities & it's HER job to deal with them, not you. She isn't dealing with them so it projects onto you. She's toxic to be with so I really advise distancing yourself from her no matter what she says. It's her fault she lost her only friend, not you. You've been nothing but kind.", "Oh I completely agree that OP is innocent here. Her friend's insecurities are not Op's fault. The friend is a total hypocrite who can't handle when people dish her attitude back to her.", "Imagine saying it to a 14 year old hitting on you. That's how you should treat it.", "I\u2019m going to venture a guess and say you\u2019ve not been to boot camp? \n\nI think you\u2019re conflating your opinions of the purpose of boot camp vs. the purpose of the military.\n\nThe reasons people join the military are a whole different conversation.", "You obviously do not know what you are talking about and are just throwing your political views out there. Boot camp is far from brutal. The function of a military force is to defend a country, and its interest. They do not abuse the \"young adults\" they cannot even yell at them anymore. Your rant is so uneducated, you make it out to be a capitalistic trait and I know of no socialist or communist country that does not have a military. Go find you a cave and live off the grid.", "I wish I had this superpower", "Haha love this. You told your boss to behave as I would to my toddler.", "I'm sorry you had to deal with so much yelling you developed a coping mechanism, but it's awesome that you managed one that works! Nothing pisses off someone who's angry more than others not reacting to it.\n\nI had a manager at one job who bullied all the waitresses. That included me but I mostly ignored her. Everyone else was happy because she was focused on me so they were actually doing better work not feeling like they were going to get screamed at. But one day I had broken a toe and came in anyway. Like most wait staff in the US I didn't have health insurance so just taped it up and took Tylenol. I was on the clock for about ten minutes when someone else made a mistake on one of my tables and she yelled at me, not even giving a chance to explain. Between the pain and screaming I started to make actual mistakes. They were small like bringing a water to someone who wanted tea (which I was able to deal with at the table by saying I was brewing a fresh pitcher, and the water was to tide him over until the new stuff was ready... Which was kinda true, there was just a pitcher left from the last batch I could've poured from if I'd remembered), having to make an extra trip for a carton of milk, etc. At one point in my shift I asked someone to cover me for a few minutes and she knew I was running off to cry, which I had covered her for in the past. I cried for a couple minutes, calmed down, and went back to work. The entire staff knew what happened and were really upset because even I had been pushed to far. The owner was called by one of the staff about it. I got an apology, but it was a really bad day. I moved soon after, but as many friends as I had there nothing could make me work under that woman again.", "As someone who struggles to have boundaries, thank you for sharing this. It helps a lot.", "I am not an emotional support animal to her\u2026 I am not an emotional support animal to her\u2026\n\nLol, but seriously thank you for the comment. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that- the people in this world amaze me sometimes", "You got this OP. The person you replied to is right, and do know that your pain is valid. It will hurt, but it will also be for the best because you are standing up and advocating for yourself. If it helps, your future self will thank you for this decision. Think of her. She deserves better than this \"friend\" you have :( She deserves to have people who care about her, will cheer her on, not put her down or tell secrets to hurt her.
