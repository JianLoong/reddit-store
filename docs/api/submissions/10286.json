She doesn\u2019t care about people and their opinions bc they\u2019re \u201ctoo much noise\u201d. I find myself getting into men drama as I cant seem to judge character and she has helped. \n \n2days ago, we were in uni and a guy sat next to me. I start chatting to him& when she comes, I can tell she\u2019s annoyed.  She sits down, crosses her arms and tuts loudly. Me& the guy laugh awkwardly but keep talking &he asks for my number. My friend abruptly says \u201cshe\u2019s not interested, go away\u201d. He looks irritated& says \u201cI was asking her\u201d. She says \u201ctake a hint, bitch boy\u201d. I step in &nudge her saying he\u2019s being nice and for her to chill. The guy just says \u201cok? Wtf?\u201d She says \u201cthat\u2019s all they all  do, fucking horny apes\u201d. He\u2019s looks annoyed. After a bit, I apologise &he leaves.\n\nI was pretty annoyed& say that I can tell a guy myself if Im not interested. She says \u201cyou can never say no\u201d. I tell her she\u2019s rude but she says that she\u2019s just honest. I say there\u2019s a difference between honest &being a plain bitch. She is fuming and says \u201cdid you just call me a bitch\u201d. I say \u201cthat\u2019s what you were acting like\u201d.\n\nShe starts screaming that idk what it\u2019s like, I always get everything I want, I have pretty privilege, I can eat what I want (she is overweight). I sympathise with her and go to hug her, but she pushes me &says \u201cstop trying to act like the nice girl all the time\u201d.I get annoyed &say \u201clisten, I know you\u2019re upset but you don\u2019t have a right to be mean to me. I\u2019m just trying to help\u201d.\n\nShe gets angry& in my face and stars shouting sl**, that If men could see past looks, they\u2019d prefer her over bc I\u2019m fake, I love attention& making her look like shit and that I get with multiple guys&I\u2019m not mature enough to handle them (this is hurtful bc she knows some of them were ab*sive or forceful). In the end, she said I had nothing to offer but my face and body.\n\n I am crying &she says \u201csave the tears.Your life has given you nothing to cry about. Try being considered ugly for a day\u201d.\n\nI scoff &say \u201cyou being \u201cugly\u201d is not my problem so stopping making it mine. Guys don\u2019t come to you-not because of your weight, face, it\u2019s because you\u2019re a fucking asshole\u201d. She just keeps repeating \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that\u201d crying. I leave. I tell my friends; they\u2019re annoyed& ignore her saying they weren\u2019t too fond of her anyways.\n\nYday, I got a long text accusing me of turning our friends against her& saying I\u2019m petty. She says she opened up and I used it against her. I ignored her text but my sister said that I was an asshole as my friend was obviously insecure& deeply upset about something but I didn\u2019t comfort her.

Finally a different friend told me that if that is how is she is, why would I want to get used to it? It Finally clicked that she would try to distance all my other friends and monopolize all my time to only be focused on her, and would do everything she could to isolate me. She ended up dating my brother, made him go NC with me for almost 2 years before he also woke up to how manipulative she was. I think it's great your other friends also know the deal, and much support to you in the future.

I am what you would call above average in the looks department, I am truly not trying to brag or be conceited, it is just relevant to what I'm trying to say. I had a friend when I was 17, Emma. Emma was a cute girl, blonde, 5'2, pretty eyes etc very girl next door. We became friends and after about a month or so, I noticed that anytime I would say something with the slightest hint of a complaint (example: I have a bit of a headache and im feeling kind of sick)  her response was always \"oh please, your life is so easy with your pretty privilege, youll be fine\" things that didn't even make sense. I wasn't allowed to ever say that I didn't like something about my appearance, wasn't allowed to make any comments about liking boys because it wasn't fair to her, if i was feeling sad about something I should just \"get over it, your life is so easy when you're pretty, what do you have to be sad about.\"\n\nIt got to a point where I hated being around her. She would always complain that no boys liked her because as soon as they saw me, they didn't care about her, but it was actually her personality plus her hatred towards men that turned them off almost immediately after meeting her when she would be fake crying about how ugly she is and men never give her attention, only me. It was truly exhausting. It got to a point that I would literally not wear makeup around her and dress in sweats so she would stop hurling insults at me. We had to finish the year at school together, but after that, I didn't really hear from her much nor did I reach out. \n\nI know that she is still single 11 years later and pretty miserable. It makes me sad for her, she pushed everyone away with her horrible attitude and now she's paying the price. \n\nAnyway, you are definitely not the asshole in this situation, and If you can , I would cut contact with her immediately. Her jealousy will only grow and start to affect your mental health because she'll likely get more and more aggressive with you over time. I'm sorry you have to put up with that, it's not a good time.\n\nBest of luck OP\u2764", "Holy shit, with friends like her who needs enemies. You are totally NTA.", "NTA.

You need to learn who to keep in your life and who you need to move on from. I think we all can agree that what you said was hurtful and unkind.

But honestly, she's just barely one given the whole context of the situation. Because I suspect that about 90% of what she said about you is true, by your own (reluctant) admission.\n\nI won't victim blame and say that it's your fault that you've had abusive or otherwise predatory partners. But you're unequivocally an AH because you openly admit that you not only KNOW that you have terrible judgement when it comes to men, but (and you clearly have sought to downplay this as much as possible) that she has \"helped you\" . . . which means one of two things:\n\n*Either you've depended on her repeatedly to get you out of bad situations in the past, or you have asked her repeatedly to help you avoid problematic men/situations because you are aware of your own shitty judgement.*\n\nGiven that truth, you're a massive AH because **you've put her in a no-win situation**. You insist on making your problems her problems, and treating her like your personal therapist/bodyguard to protect you from your own poor choices . . . but in the moment, when she actually tries to do that for you, you are utterly shitty to her. You treat her like a nosy, intrusive PITA; you insult her openly; you act like you don't know why she's interfering . . . even though you know perfectly well that she's the one who's going to be picking your crying ass up off the floor when it all goes wrong. And when she calls you on your shit, you take the side of whichever rando you're trying to flirt with.\n\nAnd the worst part is, she's not even judging you. YOU are the one who says you have poor judgement and rely on her. She's just trying to what you ask of her. YTA for being two-faced, exhausting, and generally just not a good friend to her. Don't ask for help and then be rude when you get it.", "ESH. Why are you two friends? You are awful to each other.", "NTA. She\u2019s sounds exhausting.", "Why are you all friends? ESH", "You probably didn't need to call her \"ugly\" as that is very subjective anyway, but she just seems a bit toxic. Even though we are hearing your side of the story she just sounds very negative and just plain rude. Maybe she has a crush on you but I don't think you were an asshole here, you just rose to the bait when she was looking for a fight and she came off second best.

Well, maybe it\u2019s for the best the \u201cfriendship\u201d ends. She definitely needs get therapy, but staying in a toxic friendship will drain you both even more. Also, hone in on your skills to know when there\u2019s red flags in potential partners. You deserve to NOT be taken advantage of by weirdos with ulterior motives.", "No, it's not. Your friend called you shallow, threw your trauma in your face, practically blamed you for every single one of her faults. Your friends know better than your family and have obviously seen through her act. You stood up for yourself and hopefully gave your friend a good dose of reality. Also, you'd think your mother would care more about looking out for yourself, not another woman who makes you out to be the bad guy in her life. Her issue isn't being overweight or not good-looking. Her issue is that she's a shallow, self-centered individual who would rather take her insecurities out on you than help herself work through them.", "Can\u2019t remember who said it but \u201cpeople that describe themselves as brutally honest care more about being brutal than being honest \u201c", "I will. This is honestly so eye opening for me because in my head, I always like being mature is getting over it and being her friend. Or being mature is not taking things personally. Most of these comments have shown me that I need to mature massively, so thanks!", "Ha! I just wrote the same thing in response to her comment.", "Wow, I never really thought about the connection between the two but that was a bit eye opening for me. I agree, I know I have some issues with enforcing boundaries which I need to work on. Maybe I need the therapist also lol? Thanks for this!", ">She has no one else because you\u2019re the only doormat willing to put up with her.  \n>  \n>I\u2019m not trying to be rude, but there\u2019s a reason you keep ending up in abusive situations. You\u2019re too nice and let people stomp all over you. Abusers will pick up on that and single you out.\n\nTHIS EXACTLY!!! I was a homely and fat guy, but gregarious and nice, and willing to tolerate way too much. I ended up in relationships that were VERY abusive a couple of times, with girls that were \"out of my league\". What people didn't realize was that I was with women who were abusive and controlling anger addicts who found a doormat they could step all over. Abusers look for people who will put up with them. \n\n(Don't worry, I've since learned to see the signs, and I've had healthy relationships too)", "Haha!!! Right?! I was thinking, \u201cMa\u2019am, if ever there was a candidate for regular old therapist then this chick is the one!\u201d She needs any kind of therapy she can get! She doesn\u2019t want to accept that SHE has a problem.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard out here for an ugly chick (I have been one), but that\u2019s when you *really* need to have a good personality and your mind right! Because the world can be cruel. But that\u2019s when you have to have kindness and love for yourself and for those who are true, caring friends and family. Being hyper hateful and hyper defensive isn\u2019t a long-term solution.", "You\u2019re sweet, but a major part of maturing is taking good care of yourself. That involves knowing how to set boundaries and who to involve in your life. You\u2019re doing good so far, wish you the best!", "Hi OP.\n\nI raised 2 amazing kids that are around your age.\n\nI always talked to them about my \"rules of life.\"\n\nRule 1: Always treat everyone with dignity and respect, even if you don't like them.\n\nRule 2:  Always demand that everyone treats you with dignity and respect.\n\nYour friend is not following the rules.  You are.\n\nA big part of maturity is understanding when to remove negative people from your life.\n\nGood luck!", "Look, she would do it to you in a heartbeat. Cut you off from your friends and make you out to be the bad guy if she could. It\u2019s hard to think that people don\u2019t treat us the same way we would treat them, and life shouldn\u2019t be tit for tat, but it also shouldn\u2019t be this one sided. \n\nMaturity is about striking a balance. You need to protect yourself and surround yourself with good people. My BFF and I have an \u201chonesty\u201d policy, we are honest with each other but we also hold each others feelings in high regard. \n\nWe are the \u201cYou look beautiful in that dress, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s doing the MOST it could for you\u201d not \u201cthat dress makes you look like fat\u201d friends. I would never say anything like your friend did to you. \n\nMy BFF is particularly conventionally beautiful and a yoga instructor. To me that she so is beautiful is wonderful for her and I love that she is so passionate about her health and what goes into her body.\n\n  It\u2019s not a source of jealousy, her confidence in herself  is a source of joy for me as she hasn\u2019t always felt that way.\n\nThese are the types of people yoj want in your life, those who encourage you and feel love when you feel love, joy when you are happy and pride when your successful.", "Real friends build you up, not tear you down. She\u2019s not being a good friend to you. You don\u2019t have to put up with them treating you like absolute garbage. You can choose to walk away, and you should.\n\nI know you\u2019re young, but this is one of the most important skills you can learn\u2014how to set boundaries for yourself. Decide how you want people to treat you, and don\u2019t put up with anything less. Surround yourself with people who want the best for you and who think you are amazing. Don\u2019t waste your time on people like your \u201cfriend.\u201d Take it from someone in her 50s: life\u2019s too short.", "Being mature also means establishing ironclad boundaries when necessary. You need to take care of yourself too, not just worry about her.", "Therapy will absolutely help with establishing boundaries with people. Find you a good therapist and ditch the abusive \"friend\" and you'll be much better for it.", ">Maybe I need the therapist also lol? Thanks for this!\n\nDo that, but BE CAREFUL picking a therapist. My worst, most manipulative, ex worked for a mental health agency. Therapists are people too, they can be good or bad.", "If you haven\u2019t already, use this situation as a \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate x, y, and z behavior.\u201d Lay out your ground rules and dealbreakers so when a situation like this arises again, you have that conversation already started.", "She doesn\u2019t have friends because she\u2019s awful. She needs a therapist,  not a doormat.", "Thank you so much- you\u2019re so kind! I will!", "This comment felt so warm and sweet\u2764\ufe0f and it\u2019s such great advice. You sound like a great mum and I will do that! Thanks x"]}
