Shes the you either like it or you don\u2019t personalities. Often, she\u2019ll say something really rude to someone& justify it as \u201cjust honest\u201d. She doesn\u2019t care about people and their opinions bc they\u2019re \u201ctoo much noise\u201d. I find myself getting into men drama as I cant seem to judge character and she has helped. \n \n2days ago, we were in uni and a guy sat next to me. I start chatting to him& when she comes, I can tell she\u2019s annoyed.  She sits down, crosses her arms and tuts loudly. Me& the guy laugh awkwardly but keep talking &he asks for my number. My friend abruptly says \u201cshe\u2019s not interested, go away\u201d. He looks irritated& says \u201cI was asking her\u201d. She says \u201ctake a hint, bitch boy\u201d. I step in &nudge her saying he\u2019s being nice and for her to chill. The guy just says \u201cok? Wtf?\u201d She says \u201cthat\u2019s all they all  do, fucking horny apes\u201d. He\u2019s looks annoyed. After a bit, I apologise &he leaves.\n\nI was pretty annoyed& say that I can tell a guy myself if Im not interested. She says \u201cyou can never say no\u201d. I tell her she\u2019s rude but she says that she\u2019s just honest. I say there\u2019s a difference between honest &being a plain bitch. She is fuming and says \u201cdid you just call me a bitch\u201d. I say \u201cthat\u2019s what you were acting like\u201d.\n\nShe starts screaming that idk what it\u2019s like, I always get everything I want, I have pretty privilege, I can eat what I want (she is overweight). I sympathise with her and go to hug her, but she pushes me &says \u201cstop trying to act like the nice girl all the time\u201d.I get annoyed &say \u201clisten, I know you\u2019re upset but you don\u2019t have a right to be mean to me. I\u2019m just trying to help\u201d.\n\nShe gets angry& in my face and stars shouting sl**, that If men could see past looks, they\u2019d prefer her over bc I\u2019m fake, I love attention& making her look like shit and that I get with multiple guys&I\u2019m not mature enough to handle them (this is hurtful bc she knows some of them were ab*sive or forceful). In the end, she said I had nothing to offer but my face and body.\n\n I am crying &she says \u201csave the tears.Your life has given you nothing to cry about. Try being considered ugly for a day\u201d.\n\nI scoff &say \u201cyou being \u201cugly\u201d is not my problem so stopping making it mine. Guys don\u2019t come to you-not because of your weight, face, it\u2019s because you\u2019re a fucking asshole\u201d. She just keeps repeating \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that\u201d crying. I leave. I tell my friends; they\u2019re annoyed& ignore her saying they weren\u2019t too fond of her anyways.\n\nYday, I got a long text accusing me of turning our friends against her& saying I\u2019m petty. She says she opened up and I used it against her. I ignored her text but my sister said that I was an asshole as my friend was obviously insecure& deeply upset about something but I didn\u2019t comfort her.

Finally a different friend told me that if that is how is she is, why would I want to get used to it? It Finally clicked that she would try to distance all my other friends and monopolize all my time to only be focused on her, and would do everything she could to isolate me. She ended up dating my brother, made him go NC with me for almost 2 years before he also woke up to how manipulative she was. I think it's great your other friends also know the deal, and much support to you in the future.

I am what you would call above average in the looks department, I am truly not trying to brag or be conceited, it is just relevant to what I'm trying to say. I had a friend when I was 17, Emma. Emma was a cute girl, blonde, 5'2, pretty eyes etc very girl next door. We became friends and after about a month or so, I noticed that anytime I would say something with the slightest hint of a complaint (example: I have a bit of a headache and im feeling kind of sick)  her response was always \"oh please, your life is so easy with your pretty privilege, youll be fine\" things that didn't even make sense. I wasn't allowed to ever say that I didn't like something about my appearance, wasn't allowed to make any comments about liking boys because it wasn't fair to her, if i was feeling sad about something I should just \"get over it, your life is so easy when you're pretty, what do you have to be sad about.\"\n\nIt got to a point where I hated being around her. She would always complain that no boys liked her because as soon as they saw me, they didn't care about her, but it was actually her personality plus her hatred towards men that turned them off almost immediately after meeting her when she would be fake crying about how ugly she is and men never give her attention, only me. It was truly exhausting. It got to a point that I would literally not wear makeup around her and dress in sweats so she would stop hurling insults at me. We had to finish the year at school together, but after that, I didn't really hear from her much nor did I reach out. \n\nI know that she is still single 11 years later and pretty miserable. It makes me sad for her, she pushed everyone away with her horrible attitude and now she's paying the price. \n\nAnyway, you are definitely not the asshole in this situation, and If you can , I would cut contact with her immediately. Her jealousy will only grow and start to affect your mental health because she'll likely get more and more aggressive with you over time. I'm sorry you have to put up with that, it's not a good time.\n\nBest of luck OP\u2764", "Holy shit, with friends like her who needs enemies. You are totally NTA.", "NTA.

But honestly, she's just barely one given the whole context of the situation. Because I suspect that about 90% of what she said about you is true, by your own (reluctant) admission.\n\nI won't victim blame and say that it's your fault that you've had abusive or otherwise predatory partners. But you're unequivocally an AH because you openly admit that you not only KNOW that you have terrible judgement when it comes to men, but (and you clearly have sought to downplay this as much as possible) that she has \"helped you\" . . . which means one of two things:\n\n*Either you've depended on her repeatedly to get you out of bad situations in the past, or you have asked her repeatedly to help you avoid problematic men/situations because you are aware of your own shitty judgement.*\n\nGiven that truth, you're a massive AH because **you've put her in a no-win situation**. You insist on making your problems her problems, and treating her like your personal therapist/bodyguard to protect you from your own poor choices . . . but in the moment, when she actually tries to do that for you, you are utterly shitty to her. You treat her like a nosy, intrusive PITA; you insult her openly; you act like you don't know why she's interfering . . . even though you know perfectly well that she's the one who's going to be picking your crying ass up off the floor when it all goes wrong. And when she calls you on your shit, you take the side of whichever rando you're trying to flirt with.\n\nAnd the worst part is, she's not even judging you. YOU are the one who says you have poor judgement and rely on her. She's just trying to what you ask of her. YTA for being two-faced, exhausting, and generally just not a good friend to her. Don't ask for help and then be rude when you get it.", "ESH. Why are you two friends? You are awful to each other.", "NTA. She\u2019s sounds exhausting.", "Why are you all friends? ESH", "You probably didn't need to call her \"ugly\" as that is very subjective anyway, but she just seems a bit toxic. Even though we are hearing your side of the story she just sounds very negative and just plain rude. Maybe she has a crush on you but I don't think you were an asshole here, you just rose to the bait when she was looking for a fight and she came off second best.

Your friend called you shallow, threw your trauma in your face, practically blamed you for every single one of her faults. Your friends know better than your family and have obviously seen through her act. You stood up for yourself and hopefully gave your friend a good dose of reality. Also, you'd think your mother would care more about looking out for yourself, not another woman who makes you out to be the bad guy in her life. Her issue isn't being overweight or not good-looking.

I just wrote the same thing in response to her comment.", "Wow, I never really thought about the connection between the two but that was a bit eye opening for me.
