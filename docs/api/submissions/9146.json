{"id": 9146, "submission_id": "10trw4e", "title": "AITA for changing my granddaughters hair without her parents' permission?", "selftext": "To set the scene here, I am a 55 year old father of four and grandfather of five. The pertinent ones here are my eldest daughter Michelle who is 34, her husband Peter who is 35 & my grandchildren Beth and Sam, who are 12 and 14 respectively. To give some context to the rest of this post, Beth and Sam are adopted and are black, where the rest of the family is white. \n\nThe problem arose when Michelle and Peter finally saved up enough money to take their dream honeymoon which they couldn't afford when they got married. It was a month-long holiday, during which time Beth and Sam came to stay with me. Beth has beautiful curly hair and lots of it, which she obviously washes and maintains herself, but she's still learning how to do certain styles in it. I asked out of curiosity what kind of style she'd like to know and she showed me some pictures of ladies online with very impressive braids. Now, I've been bald as an egg since I was 40 and the only \"style\" I had before that was a mohawk in my 20s, so elaborate braids are a bit beyond my skillset, but a coworker of mine who is my \"work daughter\" often has her hair done in styles very similar to the ones Beth showed me. I asked her where she gets her hair done and explained it was for my granddaughter, and she told me that it's actually her sister who is a professional braider and put me in touch with her. Took Beth to the sister, she got some very cool braids which have beads on and a cute little heart pattern at the sides and the sister explained all of the upkeep stuff to us and even gave us the friends and family discount which was very nice. \n\nWell cut to Michelle's return and she's deeply unhappy about me doing this. Apparently, she has always told Beth no to getting such braiding done because she believes that she's too young for it and also because she says it's expensive and doesn't want Beth to get the idea that it's going to be an all the time thing. I've said that I'm quite happy to pay for her to get it done as often as she likes because of how happy it made her, but Michelle is still taking the huff with me about. Peter is siding with her as he says parents should be consulted about such things. Sam is sticking up for me by saying that it's nice that I'm letting Beth partake in parts of black culture she might miss out on in a white family, which wasn't even really an aspect I'd considered, honestly. I obviously am not happy that my daughter is not happy, but I'm not sure if I really did anything wrong here.

It's a non-permanent hair style, it can be a one-time treat from grandpa that her parents don't usually go for. \n\nAnd it sounds lovely, age-appropriate, and like a major labor-saver for Beth. Sometimes, when we leave children with their grandparents, grandparents make different choices than parents would make at home, as long as the choices aren't harmful, directly contradictory to specific family values, or permanent, I'm not one for thinking it's a big deal.", "NTA. Your 12yo granddaughter has every right to get braids in if she wants. \n\nI have the uncomfortable feeling that Michelle didn't want her daughter to look too \"black\" or something. If I'm correct, that's awful and makes her seem insecure.", "Twelve is more than old enough to have a say in her hairstyle AND old enough to maintain it. I'm amused by the \"not old enough for braids\" argument,  I teach in a predominantly black elementary school and the majority of the girls and a good half of the boys have braids,  beads and dreads. \n\nI have a feeling a couple other posters are right and it's more about your daughters discomfort with her daughter's race than her age or ability to care for her hair properly.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You did a cool thing for your granddaughter and I honestly think your daughter is overreacting. It's probably more about the shock of the change than anything. Some people might harp on asking before making changes, but you didn't have her hair cut or make a permanent change. Above that, your daughter's semi valid complaint about the cost is nullified by you offering to pay. I also get some red flags off your daughter about her saying that she is \"too young\" for braids (what?) and didn't want her to get them. \n\nI think that if there isn't some deeper issue with your daughter's unhappiness with the braids that given a little time she will calm down and realize that she is overreacting.", "NTA. I think you did a beautiful thing. Your granddaughter will appreciate this in the future. Perhaps your daughter can learn how to help with your granddaughter\u2019s hair care. She may not be able to do elaborate braids but she can learn how to simple styles. I grew up with a white foster mother. Till this day, she does the best French plait in my nature hair. She learnt how to care for my hair. It helped us bond. You sound like a cool grandfather. I\u2019m glad that Sam appreciates your efforts. Your work daughter is probably impressed as well.", "You did a wonderful thing for your grandaughter. Ofcourse, it is usually pertinent to ask and involve the parents in all major decisions. Apparence is major to some people.\n\nBut whats done is done. \n\nYour daughter will come to realize that the happiness of her child surpasses any possible minor lack of judgement that was made on your part. That what you did was not done in an intentually bad manner but just the opposite. That braiding her hair is just the TIP of the iceberg  towards introducing your granddaughter to her culture. \n\nYou're NTA, dont be hard on yourself.", "NTA she got braids in. It's not like you shaved her head. You did a nice thing for the kid, end of. No permanent change. Her mum needs to dial it back a bit.", "NTA \n\nYour daughter adopted a Black child and should as a bare minimum know about Black haircare. Braids are a protective style that are suitable from a young age, and Beth is old enough to have them. She's also old enough to decide what she wants to do with her own hair that grows out of her own head, regardless of her mother's wishes. \n\nYou took Beth to a professional braider who obviously knows how to treat Black children's hair. Hopefully you make her Beth's go-to stylist from now on. I assume this woman is Black; if so, she can become a valuable person for Beth to connect with, as Beth learns more about her own hair and how to take care of it, as well as learning about different aspects of Black culture. \n\nSometimes white adoptive mothers of Black children can get a little put out, possessive, and even jealous, when the children start connecting with other Black people, or learning about aspects of their own Black cultures.\n\nIf this is what Michelle is doing (even if she denies it) you need to tell her to calm down. Beth isn't being taken away from her, she's just learning about her hair. I would continue to pay for the braiding so that Michelle doesn't have an excuse to pull Beth away from what could be a source of connection for her.", "I get their point, they should have been consulted as a courtesy, but I also think in general both of these kids are old enough to have 100% control over their own hairstyle.\n\nFor their mom to say no to something so innocuous is overly controlling imo, whereas her saying no to paying for it is different/reasonable.  But her upset seems to be over a loss of control that shouldn\u2019t really be hers to begin with at this point. \n\nIt\u2019s super nice of you to offer to pay for it in an ongoing way, too. NAH", "NTA. It's not a permanent hairstyle, it's not one not recommended for her age (like bleach or some hair dyes) and it's a treat while staying with grandfather for a month.\n\nI agree parents should be consulted for major changes but braids can just be removed.", "NTA, and you are adorable. \n\nBut even though you are not an asshole, you have created a problem for your GD. If her parents don't want to facilitate the further upkeep of the braids, they will probably have to come out. Maybe Mom had some points about cost and labor? \n\nSo you may have to explain to your GD that you didn't think this all the way through, and you learned something valuable here.", "Definitely NTA, assuming you had no idea her parents told her that she couldn\u2019t have braids\n\nYou did a sweet thing that no doubt made her day. You had no reason to believe you were doing anything wrong, and no reasonable person would have felt otherwise. You didn\u2019t get her hair cut but instead had a totally reversible procedure done. And since then, you\u2019ve offered to pay for her future braiding out of your own pocket. So no, again assuming you didn\u2019t know her parents\u2019 thoughts on braiding, NTA. Your granddaughter is lucky to have you. Her parents kind of suck though.", "NTA.  \nYou did a nice thing for your granddaughter. This doesn\u2019t harm her parents in any way.  \nUltimately, they may not give you the opportunity to do this again in the future, as they seem to be set on control here. That said, you did nothing wrong by doing something your granddaughter wanted.", "NTA you didn\u2019t make a permanent change. It was a special thing for your granddaughter. I think it\u2019s sweet", "Absolutely NTA. You did a nice thing for your granddaughter. As long as she\u2019s happy and you were happy to pay, I think there should be no complaints from anyone.", "NTA close to NAH. The change you made wasn\u2019t permanent. The daughter wanted it and was happy with it. I do think most things should be told to parents ahead of time but again as this wasn\u2019t permanent I think your daughter is overreacting", "NTA. Your granddaughter is old enough to choose her hairstyle and your daughter's objection to her getting braids feels a bit, ah, racially insensitive.", "NTA\n\nBraids aren't permanent.   It's just a style.  Your daughter's reaction makes about as much sense as getting mad because you put her hair in a ponytail. \n\nGirls and women of all ages wear braids.", "NTA she's 12 she's old enough to decide what hairstyle she wants", "NTA. I\u2019d understand if you let her cut all her hair off, or if you let her dye it, but braids are no big deal. You made your granddaughter extremely happy and she\u2019s gotten to experience a very important part of her culture! \n\nYour daughter and son in law will get over it.", "NTA. Even though you should have consulted with her parents, I think it was nice of you to give her that experience, especially because none of the family can braid her hair like that.  \n\nAlso, too young for braids? That's new, especially since toddlers get their hair braided too. Perhaps her parents could benefit from learning the cultural significance of braids and what hair represents in different African cultures.", "NTA, your daughter willingly adopted two kids one with different needs and isn\u2019t willing to take the time to learn to care for them as needed. \n\nShe easily could take the opportunity to learn alongside her daughter as a bonding moment as well but is deciding to be ignorant especially after what you offered. I hope your granddaughter doesn\u2019t feel less than for what she\u2019s been shown", "NTA 100 percent. Your granddaughter stayed with you for a month, and you did a lovely thing for her. Hair is hair, it grows. But it is also identity, and you allowed her a way to express herself that she hadn\u2019t had before. It is unfortunate that your daughter had decided that she was too young for this particular style, but you couldn\u2019t know that unless she told you.", "From the title I was prepared to say YTA but reading it I\u2019m not too sure. I think I lack some cultural understanding and maybe some context but this sounds quite sweet and a nice thing to do, so I\u2019ll go with NTA", "The ONLY thing you did wrong IMO is you didn't consult FIRST. Which makes this a very soft YTA.\n\nBut supporting your grandchild's choices is a massively great thing to do.", "Soft YTA. You did a nice thing, but the parents should of been consulted about this first. Clearly Michelle had already said no about the braids at this point.", "YTA, also.. if the kid knew she wasn\u2019t allowed to have them yet but never told you that through the whole process then there\u2019s another issue. I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re trying to turn it into a race thing when it\u2019s clearly an age and money thing. She\u2019s not going to miss out on it she just can\u2019t have it at the moment", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's 12, let her experiment and try out stuff.", "I was more than ready to say that you were the AH with the title. \n\nYou didn't chop, or color it. She just got braids.

All temporary and easily removed. \n\nIf his granddaughter had any friends with similar hair, she would be too. \n\nFrom multiple conversations from my POC friends, there are completely different needs for their hair that I have never even thought about. \n\nThe parents adopted children of a different race and are just ignoring any needs those children might have in favor of their ideals. \n\nProtective braiding styles are done in the black community from a young age. Those include braids. And they are gorgeous imo.", "I'm going to ignore the culture aspect because ultimately I don't think it's relevant. The kid is 12 and should be able within reason to decide her hair. And grandpa is willing to pickup the cost.", "Ummm why shouldn't the granddaughter have braids, which are a part of her culture, because her mommy doesn't like it? It's a protective style and her mother denying it is actually really awful, not to mention this is a 12 year old, not a 4 year old.", "I'd agree if the kid was younger but this kid is 12 and old enough to decide her hairstyle.", "I'm white, and I can't even imagine how I understand the needs of the granddaughters hair more than her own mother. She adopted a child with a need she can't fill, and I think that's what this is about. In my opinion, the mom didn't want the braids because she was afraid that her daughter wouldn't see her as much as her mother but the woman who adopted her. Maybe I'm wrong, and she is wildly out of touch with hair that has texture in general (I hit my 40's before finding out my frizzy, broken, puffy hair was wavy and needed proper care) but I think this goes past hair and into the territory of the moms fears."]}
