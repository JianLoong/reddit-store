The pertinent ones here are my eldest daughter Michelle who is 34, her husband Peter who is 35 & my grandchildren Beth and Sam, who are 12 and 14 respectively. To give some context to the rest of this post, Beth and Sam are adopted and are black, where the rest of the family is white. \n\nThe problem arose when Michelle and Peter finally saved up enough money to take their dream honeymoon which they couldn't afford when they got married. It was a month-long holiday, during which time Beth and Sam came to stay with me. Beth has beautiful curly hair and lots of it, which she obviously washes and maintains herself, but she's still learning how to do certain styles in it. I asked out of curiosity what kind of style she'd like to know and she showed me some pictures of ladies online with very impressive braids. Now, I've been bald as an egg since I was 40 and the only \"style\" I had before that was a mohawk in my 20s, so elaborate braids are a bit beyond my skillset, but a coworker of mine who is my \"work daughter\" often has her hair done in styles very similar to the ones Beth showed me. I asked her where she gets her hair done and explained it was for my granddaughter, and she told me that it's actually her sister who is a professional braider and put me in touch with her. Took Beth to the sister, she got some very cool braids which have beads on and a cute little heart pattern at the sides and the sister explained all of the upkeep stuff to us and even gave us the friends and family discount which was very nice. \n\nWell cut to Michelle's return and she's deeply unhappy about me doing this. Apparently, she has always told Beth no to getting such braiding done because she believes that she's too young for it and also because she says it's expensive and doesn't want Beth to get the idea that it's going to be an all the time thing. I've said that I'm quite happy to pay for her to get it done as often as she likes because of how happy it made her, but Michelle is still taking the huff with me about. Peter is siding with her as he says parents should be consulted about such things. Sam is sticking up for me by saying that it's nice that I'm letting Beth partake in parts of black culture she might miss out on in a white family, which wasn't even really an aspect I'd considered, honestly. I obviously am not happy that my daughter is not happy, but I'm not sure if I really did anything wrong here.

It's a non-permanent hair style, it can be a one-time treat from grandpa that her parents don't usually go for. \n\nAnd it sounds lovely, age-appropriate, and like a major labor-saver for Beth. Sometimes, when we leave children with their grandparents, grandparents make different choices than parents would make at home, as long as the choices aren't harmful, directly contradictory to specific family values, or permanent, I'm not one for thinking it's a big deal.", "NTA. Your 12yo granddaughter has every right to get braids in if she wants. \n\nI have the uncomfortable feeling that Michelle didn't want her daughter to look too \"black\" or something. If I'm correct, that's awful and makes her seem insecure.", "Twelve is more than old enough to have a say in her hairstyle AND old enough to maintain it. I'm amused by the \"not old enough for braids\" argument,  I teach in a predominantly black elementary school and the majority of the girls and a good half of the boys have braids,  beads and dreads. \n\nI have a feeling a couple other posters are right and it's more about your daughters discomfort with her daughter's race than her age or ability to care for her hair properly.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You did a cool thing for your granddaughter and I honestly think your daughter is overreacting. It's probably more about the shock of the change than anything. Some people might harp on asking before making changes, but you didn't have her hair cut or make a permanent change. Above that, your daughter's semi valid complaint about the cost is nullified by you offering to pay. I also get some red flags off your daughter about her saying that she is \"too young\" for braids (what?) and didn't want her to get them. \n\nI think that if there isn't some deeper issue with your daughter's unhappiness with the braids that given a little time she will calm down and realize that she is overreacting.", "NTA. I think you did a beautiful thing. Your granddaughter will appreciate this in the future. Perhaps your daughter can learn how to help with your granddaughter\u2019s hair care. She may not be able to do elaborate braids but she can learn how to simple styles. I grew up with a white foster mother. Till this day, she does the best French plait in my nature hair. She learnt how to care for my hair. It helped us bond. You sound like a cool grandfather. I\u2019m glad that Sam appreciates your efforts. Your work daughter is probably impressed as well.", "You did a wonderful thing for your grandaughter. Ofcourse, it is usually pertinent to ask and involve the parents in all major decisions. Apparence is major to some people.\n\nBut whats done is done. \n\nYour daughter will come to realize that the happiness of her child surpasses any possible minor lack of judgement that was made on your part. That what you did was not done in an intentually bad manner but just the opposite. That braiding her hair is just the TIP of the iceberg  towards introducing your granddaughter to her culture. \n\nYou're NTA, dont be hard on yourself.", "NTA she got braids in. It's not like you shaved her head. You did a nice thing for the kid, end of. No permanent change. Her mum needs to dial it back a bit.", "NTA \n\nYour daughter adopted a Black child and should as a bare minimum know about Black haircare. Braids are a protective style that are suitable from a young age, and Beth is old enough to have them. She's also old enough to decide what she wants to do with her own hair that grows out of her own head, regardless of her mother's wishes. \n\nYou took Beth to a professional braider who obviously knows how to treat Black children's hair. Hopefully you make her Beth's go-to stylist from now on. I assume this woman is Black; if so, she can become a valuable person for Beth to connect with, as Beth learns more about her own hair and how to take care of it, as well as learning about different aspects of Black culture. \n\nSometimes white adoptive mothers of Black children can get a little put out, possessive, and even jealous, when the children start connecting with other Black people, or learning about aspects of their own Black cultures.\n\nIf this is what Michelle is doing (even if she denies it) you need to tell her to calm down. Beth isn't being taken away from her, she's just learning about her hair. I would continue to pay for the braiding so that Michelle doesn't have an excuse to pull Beth away from what could be a source of connection for her.", "I get their point, they should have been consulted as a courtesy, but I also think in general both of these kids are old enough to have 100% control over their own hairstyle.\n\nFor their mom to say no to something so innocuous is overly controlling imo, whereas her saying no to paying for it is different/reasonable.  But her upset seems to be over a loss of control that shouldn\u2019t really be hers to begin with at this point. \n\nIt\u2019s super nice of you to offer to pay for it in an ongoing way, too. NAH", "NTA. It's not a permanent hairstyle, it's not one not recommended for her age (like bleach or some hair dyes) and it's a treat while staying with grandfather for a month.\n\nI agree parents should be consulted for major changes but braids can just be removed.", "NTA, and you are adorable. \n\nBut even though you are not an asshole, you have created a problem for your GD. If her parents don't want to facilitate the further upkeep of the braids, they will probably have to come out. Maybe Mom had some points about cost and labor? \n\nSo you may have to explain to your GD that you didn't think this all the way through, and you learned something valuable here.", "Definitely NTA, assuming you had no idea her parents told her that she couldn\u2019t have braids\n\nYou did a sweet thing that no doubt made her day. You had no reason to believe you were doing anything wrong, and no reasonable person would have felt otherwise. You didn\u2019t get her hair cut but instead had a totally reversible procedure done. And since then, you\u2019ve offered to pay for her future braiding out of your own pocket. So no, again assuming you didn\u2019t know her parents\u2019 thoughts on braiding, NTA. Your granddaughter is lucky to have you. Her parents kind of suck though.", "NTA.  \nYou did a nice thing for your granddaughter. This doesn\u2019t harm her parents in any way.  \nUltimately, they may not give you the opportunity to do this again in the future, as they seem to be set on control here. That said, you did nothing wrong by doing something your granddaughter wanted.", "NTA you didn\u2019t make a permanent change. It was a special thing for your granddaughter. I think it\u2019s sweet", "Absolutely NTA. You did a nice thing for your granddaughter. As long as she\u2019s happy and you were happy to pay, I think there should be no complaints from anyone.", "NTA close to NAH. The change you made wasn\u2019t permanent. The daughter wanted it and was happy with it. I do think most things should be told to parents ahead of time but again as this wasn\u2019t permanent I think your daughter is overreacting", "NTA. Your granddaughter is old enough to choose her hairstyle and your daughter's objection to her getting braids feels a bit, ah, racially insensitive.", "NTA\n\nBraids aren't permanent.   It's just a style.  Your daughter's reaction makes about as much sense as getting mad because you put her hair in a ponytail. \n\nGirls and women of all ages wear braids.", "NTA she's 12 she's old enough to decide what hairstyle she wants", "NTA. I\u2019d understand if you let her cut all her hair off, or if you let her dye it, but braids are no big deal. You made your granddaughter extremely happy and she\u2019s gotten to experience a very important part of her culture! \n\nYour daughter and son in law will get over it.", "NTA. Even though you should have consulted with her parents, I think it was nice of you to give her that experience, especially because none of the family can braid her hair like that.  \n\nAlso, too young for braids? That's new, especially since toddlers get their hair braided too. Perhaps her parents could benefit from learning the cultural significance of braids and what hair represents in different African cultures.", "NTA, your daughter willingly adopted two kids one with different needs and isn\u2019t willing to take the time to learn to care for them as needed. \n\nShe easily could take the opportunity to learn alongside her daughter as a bonding moment as well but is deciding to be ignorant especially after what you offered. I hope your granddaughter doesn\u2019t feel less than for what she\u2019s been shown", "NTA 100 percent. Your granddaughter stayed with you for a month, and you did a lovely thing for her. Hair is hair, it grows. But it is also identity, and you allowed her a way to express herself that she hadn\u2019t had before. It is unfortunate that your daughter had decided that she was too young for this particular style, but you couldn\u2019t know that unless she told you.", "From the title I was prepared to say YTA but reading it I\u2019m not too sure. I think I lack some cultural understanding and maybe some context but this sounds quite sweet and a nice thing to do, so I\u2019ll go with NTA", "The ONLY thing you did wrong IMO is you didn't consult FIRST. Which makes this a very soft YTA.\n\nBut supporting your grandchild's choices is a massively great thing to do.", "Soft YTA. You did a nice thing, but the parents should of been consulted about this first. Clearly Michelle had already said no about the braids at this point.", "YTA, also.. if the kid knew she wasn\u2019t allowed to have them yet but never told you that through the whole process then there\u2019s another issue. I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re trying to turn it into a race thing when it\u2019s clearly an age and money thing.

My black friends also regularly take breaks from braids and let their hair \u201crest\u201d (their words not mine) because of the same reasons.

I don't think you're an AH, and I think the mom is overreacting here, but I can shed some light on the age inappropriate thing, specifically since you asked!\n\nThere are SEVERAL reasons people might cite: \n\nFirst of all, not all braids are the same. Even with traditional braiding styles in many predominantly Caucasian countries and cultures, you're dealing with pretty basic one braid or 2 braids, either classic, fishtail, dutch, or french braids. 2 braids was traditionally used for children or unmarried women, (\"pigtails\") and a single braid for an adult. A lot of women (most don't but a lot still do) grow up with a bias, believing that certain hairstyles are appropriate for children, and others for adults, because of this.\n\n(vastly oversimplified, but reddit has character limits)\n\nNext, these types of braids are used also in various braided styles for many POC. There's box braids (individual braids in little boxes) and cornrows (braids in rows against the scalp).\n\nSome people (not many, but some, and there is *some* evidence to support it) believe that box braids are fine, but cornrows can cause damage to a child's scalp.\n\nDon't worry! Done properly, they are usually fine. But often girls will get small sores on their heads if the braids are too tight.\n\nSome hairstyles also look more \"mature\" than others.\n\n[This hairstyle](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a1/43/bd/a143bd68f7d0e7316c97d0d6cab28f47.jpg) is typically considered to be for children, for example. Whereas [this style](https://curlygirlswag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Long-Butterfly-Box-Braids.jpg) is typically reserved for adults.\n\nPeople wear any of these hairstyles at any age! But there *are* people who have very strong opinions on it, thinking a child's hair, like their clothing, should be childish, so as not to \"encourage\" predation. \n\nStill another reason some might feel a braided style is age-inappropriate is the amount of upkeep required, or with protective braids, the amount of care one needs to invest in removing the braids, or in revitalizing the hair once they are removed.\n\nThe last thing I'll mention, though there is a lot more! Is that a few hair types are... like lint traps in a dryer. Everything gets stuck in the hair! Most braids actually help protect against this, but certain styles can make it worse. Some children are incapable of the maintenance required to deal with this issue.\n\nMost people, I believe, let a child transition from children's styles toward more mature styles in early adolescence (think 10 year olds?) while some don't believe it's appropriate until a girl reaches her teens.\n\nThere's no real firm reason for this, it's really just a choice every family eventually makes. Some people start with intricate braids on even toddlers. A lot of it is down to the abilities/finances of the family. A lot of it is down to what habits and beliefs the parents had/have. A lot of it is down to the maturity of the child, or the child's wants for their hair.\n\nAgain, purely to answer the question, not a value judgement.", "I have no idea about the braids, if this post had been about wether or not it was okay for the mom to have that rule I wouldn\u2019t comment but it wasn\u2019t about that", "Somehow my comment ended up on the wrong thread haha sorry about that I'm killing time on mobile", "Thought I was commenting on this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tlmql/aita_for_defending_my_boss_in_front_of_her_family/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "NTA.

For children who are transracial or international adoptees, their parents cannot teach them what it means or what it\u2019s like to be an adult in that culture, and finding other adult role models from their birth culture becomes vital to navigating this.

Love this answer though", "Thanks!\n\nAnd oh yeah, I wasn't trying to represent this child specifically!\n\nJust, yknow... clarifying some reasons one person might think differently than another. \n\n(Also, I have a friend who still styles her 15yo in braids with little butterfly bobbles on them like that, like, omg she's almost old enough to drive, but whatever!)", "Grampa you are totally NTA.  There are all sorts of cultural implications re the care of textured hair and I think it's wonderful that you realized none of that, and were only trying to please your granddaughter.  \n\nThat said, am I the only one who thinks a month is a long time to be away from your kids?", "NTA. I thought you had gotten it cut or colored but getting a style done on it shouldn\u2019t be a problem, especially as a cultural thing and one that you\u2019re willing to pay for. But, now that you know there\u2019s issues I wouldn\u2019t do it without the parents permission in the future.", "I\u2019m honestly very concerned by your daughters response to the braids. That feels like a really really inappropriate level of ignorance in black hair for someone raising a black daughter. \n\nEverything else aside, please please please get an adult black woman involved in this girls life because it\u2019s going to save her a ton of heartache", "NTA, next time bleach her hair and turn it half hot pink and fiberglass the other half so it spikes, and make it blue. turn her goth, and . . . .", "Your daughter sounds ignorant/lazy and possibly racist. \n\nNta, 12 isnt too young in the slightest and you did something your daughter should have done a long time ago.", "NTA. You, sir, are a treasure.", "I am sorry this isn\u2019t racist how? What the actual f. Someone helped their kid get their done.", "NTA. I think your actions were sweet and she's lucky to have you as a grandfather. I don't understand why you'd need permission for a hairstyle, unless you were cutting it, shaving it, or giving her a mohawk. When she cools down, you need to find out exactly why your daughter found your kind and simple action so upsetting.", "Can I hug you? This is how you grampa. NTA", "NTA. Your daughter and her husband are high key TA's tho.", "NTA\n\nWhen you adopt a black kid, it is your responsibility to learn how to care for, maintain, and style their hair, or provide/pay someone who can do it for you. If Mom isn't learning how to do styling for black hair, then she should be extra grateful that you're willing to front the cost for someone else to do it.", "NTA. It sounds like you went out of your way to make sure your grand daughter\u2019s hair was properly cared for even though you had no clue how to do it.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hill worth dying on for either of you though? Your daughter could see it as a you caring for her child and an ocasional treat.\n\nYou meant well and didn\u2019t know it was an unwanted style so now you know for the future\u2026. ALSO YOU WATCHED THESE CHILDREN FOR A MONTH! I don\u2019t have children yet but I know for a fact that my mom will never do that for me \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. My colleague had braids on her 4 year olds.she gets her own braids done by someone she knows who knows how to get the tension right.\n\nI can't imagine being the kind of parent who leaves their kids for a month! Holy cow! You've made the financial offer. Offer to help explain to your grandchild this is not a regular thing. I think you're an amazing granddad.\n\nIf its pure \"I changed a hair style without asking the parents\", I guess AH normally, but they were gone a MONTH and you did it in the best possible way asking your work daughter. They're not permanent. It's not earrings or a tattoo. You've just done something which the parents had said no to, but you weren't told that. Maybe work that into the conversation with your granddaughter. Did she tell you that? It's bad form to work around adults by omitting info though understandable. \n\nBraids are a part of the POC life experience. Whether she keeps getting them in the future is another thing, but please try your best that it remains that positive moment in her life rather than this huge source of tension. \n\nI remember in my 30s in a room chatting, and my colleagues were discussing \"the first time\". They also discussed another cultural reference too - butt enhancing pants! They're missing out on this stuff growing up in a white family. I'm hoping aside from the braids, they do go full on into culture and exposure with them.", "NTA\nDo my first thought when I read the title was that you were watching the kids for a day and took one of them for a buzz cut because you thought their hair was long and unruly.\nThis is way different. \n1) I feel like a month long stay implies that you are trusted with their care and maintenance.\n2) This isn't permanent.\n3) The style is appropriate for her age.\n4) It was totally respectful of Beth's desires and image of herself.\nI hope you are able to work through this with Michelle because, honestly, you sound like the best grandpa. You put so much thought and love into this. And it's such a special thing to be able to share - especially with her bald grandpa! Like this is one of those lifetime bond things. When she's 40 she'll be at lunch with her girlfriends telling them about how her grandpa used to take her to get her braids done.", "YTA. You don't mess with a kid without the parents' permission. The hair in non-permanent, but the implications and expectations are. \n\nMy brother's ex wife comes to mind. My brother is blonde,  so is the daughter.  The ex has black hair, and so does her new boyfriend (with whom she cheated, the reason for divorce). One day she dyed the maybe 2 or 3 years old child's hair black, definitely because she looked out of place with two black-haired \"parents\". She looked awful.", "YATA for simply not getting the parents permission 1st. It's not up to you to change your granddaughters hair, you did not call her mother and discuss it. How would you have felt if your young daughter wanted her head shaved when she was a child and a relative took her and got it completely buzzed off, would you be OK?", "NTA. Generally, parents like to be consulted on matters relating to hair. I have no clue why, but they do. Anyway, her parents were away, and this was not a permanent change, so I don't see the problem. Now that you know she doesn't like it, you can tell her you won't do it again without asking. Maybe all she wanted was to be consulted. Parents are weird like that when it comes to hair (again, I have no idea why).\n\nHowever, I believe she is the AH for making it a bigger deal than it should have been. When my kids are happy, I'm happy. Shouldn't she be happy her daughter is happy? How are braids not age appropriate for 12 year olds?", "Hard NTA here (borderline NAH because I don't think Michelle is an AH either, but may not have handled this as well as she could have)\n\nWe could use more men like you in the world.\n\nMy hair is as far away from black hair as you can get, and I would be super intimidated and overwhelmed to have to care for someone's hair like that. I would be booking many appointments with the co-worker's sister, and actually asking if she would be comfortable with teaching me. If she wasn't, I'd be trawling YouTube relentlessly. I have an interest in historical costuming and have learned about all the ways that black women have had their hair policed (both in the past and present), so it is something that Michelle has to really work on so that she doesn't inadvertently reinforce any inadvertently racist views. \n\nBut good luck to you and your whole family, you all sound really loving.", "Unless your daughter specifically told you you were not to do it, it's not like you gave her a haircut. Or got her ears pierced. No different to putting her hair in ponytails when she always wears them straight. When you look after someone's children, they give you the permission to do what you feel is best, and they obviously trust your judgement otherwise they wouldn't leave their kids there. Apart from the expense (which is no issue since you offered to keep paying for it), I don't see what the big deal is. NTA", "NTA. If it pleases you and your granddaughter both, and you can afford it, it sounds like a delightful connection.\n\nOne thing I have learned, as a white woman, is how white people totally do not get Black hair. It sounds like your daughter has not really paid attention to this as an issue. Unfortunately, it may be that daughter has dug in her heels and ignores the importance of Black hair styling for her Black kids. That's tragic for your grandkids, so good in you for your support here.", "NTA with the caveat that you really should discuss with the parents first. There's really no reason for your daughter to avoid getting her daughter braids. I don't believe they are any more expensive or have any more upkeep than getting a style and blowout every 6-8 weeks. Barring that, she could learn how to do it herself or with her daughter. Haircare is vital for black children. That often includes braids or twists. \n\nIt's very kind of you to offer to pay for the braids for your granddaughter. \ud83d\ude42", "With that title, I thought you cut her hair or something. But you were helping her to take care of her hair that was long due & unreasonably denied by her lazy mother. NTA.", "NTA - Not initially for having it done  no. It's braids, not a buzz cut or dye job. Anything permanent and yeah, definitely ask!\n\nI do get her parents' concern about it being an all the time thing. It's not just the time or money, either. Constant braiding can damage hair and result in traction alopecia.", "NTA. As someone adopted by people of a different race who ignored teaching me anything about it, I wish I had a relative show the sensitivity you have. You are not an asshole, your daughter needs to wake up to the fact that her kids are a different race and start supporting them, otherwise they will have emotional/ mental issues about it all their lives.", "NTA. Does your daughter realise that braids are also a protective style for people such as your granddaughter? Well done OP.", "Yeah i got piased off with my baby mother. Cut my daughters hair well short. We were growing it. Didnt ask. Jusr did it. Just ask first init", "NTA. Granddaughter is not too young for braids at all. One of my classmates in elementary school (we were 8 or 9) had gorgeous braids that she had done like, once a week or so. Sounds like OPs daughter is insecure about her daughters hair, especially since it\u2019s up to her daughter to take care of it. Braids are beautiful and a protective style. Some people even weave loose hair in different colors into them. They\u2019re a really important form of self expression. (Edit to fix who I referred to)", "NAH\n\nIf Mom\u2019s concern was cost of upkeep and the offer to pay for them wasn\u2019t made until after the disagreement I could understand her still being annoyed.  I wouldn\u2019t like if someone gave my child something I\u2019d said no to already for financial concerns.  At that point it\u2019s already awkward and people can feel weird about taking money from their parents, too.\n\nBut Grandad did nothing wrong here if he didn\u2019t know Mom had already said no.  It sounds super sweet and made kiddo super happy.  Hopefully the grownups can sort it out so that she can keep the braids since they are making her so happy and are so great for her hair!", "I (63f, white)  remember little girls with simple braids, even toddlers... Beads and cute barrettes, too. Very pretty and neat.", "OP is the true definition of a punk, and he is all the better for it. His kids have a lot to learn from him still.", "right? gotta say this is a really nice change of pace", "Michelle did buzz her hair when she was 12 actually, at a friend's house during a sleepover. Frankly I thought it looked ace.", "Braids are different from a haircut.", "I\u2019m a black woman and the opposite is true. I wear braids as a protective style to give my natural hair a rest because it is more prone to breakage and hair loss when it\u2019s out and being constantly manipulated. \n\nYes it\u2019s true that if braids are done too tightly it can cause traction issues, but I know when a braid is too tight and can communicate that to the braider. But most of the times my braiders themselves know not to braid too tightly.\n\nThe main downside of braids is the cost, but getting them done / redone actually saves me a ton of time each day that would have otherwise been spent on a multi-step haircare process (not to mention cost of haircare products).", "I this. OP is NTA.\n\nHis daughter and son-in-law shouldn\u2019t have intentionally become parents to Black children without knowing how to care for their hair and a commitment to not excluding them from their culture of origin.", "Yep, my white adoptive mother hated my hair. She never bothered to learn how to care for it as a child, and neither did I. I'm just learning now, in my 50's. \n\nThose kids need their culture.", "Another black woman here to let you know that you are so NTA. You did something really special for your granddaughter. She is 12, that is definitely old enough for braids so don\u2019t worry about her being too young for such a style.\n\nWhat sticks out to me most about your post is what her elder brother Sam said about you helping Beth experience parts of black culture that she might otherwise miss out on. That made me a bit sad for her honestly. \n\nI hope your daughter and her husband *do* try and introduce the kids to elements of black culture. Unfortunately, some parents in transracial adoptions do not see a need to do this.", "I can see the cost being a big deal to her. I'm white and growing up we didn't even get professional haircuts until we were almost in high school, and even then only once every 9 months or so. I can see the mother being worried about the cost of keeping this up when her daughter gets used to it and the grandfather gets tired of paying.  \n\n\nThere may be other issues, but I think the concern about cost could be very real if you come from a family that never spent money on hair until they could pay for it themselves.", "Random question, I think I have hair similar to yours and I cannot get it to not be frizzy, what's your secret?", "Daughter obviously didn\u2019t mind the process. Not everyone has your experience with children", "That would be my guess. It sounds like they likely live on a somewhat small budget and she\u2019s having trouble accepting that she can\u2019t pay for her daughter\u2019s braids herself. Maybe with some time and gentle prodding she might come around?", "I'm very keen for them to keep their culture as much as they can too. I won't share too many personal details, but Sam and Beth are biological siblings who were initially fostered by daughter and son-in-law before being adopted due to some bio family problems after their first mother passed. Sam was old enough at the time that he remembers their first mum and her culture quite clearly, but Beth unfortunately doesn't remember as well. I'd like for them to keep their connection both to her and their culture as much as they can and to be fair, Michelle and her husband have always said the same thing. This is the first issue we've run into.", "Also white asf, would love to learn to braid someone's hair in these lovely ways. And enjoying the texture, my hair is stick straight. Plus support a young girls culture. Sigh...", "I'm white but with super curly (puffy and frizzy if i don't handle it properly) hair,  and i'm assuming the braids are protective due to the hair being nice and cuddled together with the other hair.\n\nIt keeps it from drying out too much and prevents damage from the sun etc.   Mine is always much softer feeling if i have it plaited or tied up than if i leave it loose.   The natural oils etc can stay there much better.\n\nHowever;  hopefully a black person can chime in on this - because obviously my line of thinking could well be wrong.  All i can go on is how mine responds to things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have often wondered about the braiding and whether it's as tight as it looks - like, is it so tight that it pulls on the scalp?", "Exactly, I kinda love him (in a wholesome, platonic way)", "It\u2019s the protective aspect of some braid styles which made me raise an eyebrow at the mom saying she\u2019s \u201ctoo young for it\u201d.  Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to learn protective styles at a younger age so she doesn\u2019t have to deal with unnecessary damage later? (Granted my own hair is in every way like hay, so maybe there\u2019s some legit concern there I\u2019m just ignorant of? Seems counterintuitive, though.)\n\nThe more I think about that particular objection, the less sense it makes. And it made very little sense to begin with.", "Leave in conditioner", "This post wasn\u2019t about the hair, it was about wether or not it\u2019s okay for a grandparent to override parental rules. If the mom says it\u2019s not appropriate for her age then the grandparent should respect that", "Oh, man. I do love my slightly wavy but far, far, far from curly hair most of the time.
