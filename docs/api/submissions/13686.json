I also don't mind my kids getting snacks within reason. However, I've taken to policing butter when a neighbor kid comes over and I'm starting to worry of I'm a crazy person.\n\n\"Jill\" lives in the neighborhood. She is tween aged, a couple of years older than my eldest kid. I don't mean to be picky about ages, but it does create a power dynamic in the friendship with my daughter. Jill is a nice, polite,  funny, and smart kid. She is autistic and struggles with boundaries, which means I have had to lay down some rules when she comes over. (Her own mother has encouraged me to do this). But while nothing huge-huge has ever happened, enough more minor stuff has happened to make me watchful of her, though I generally am happy to have her over. These more minor stuff seem to happen because, according to my daughter, Jill is older, very Type A, tends to want her way, and my daughter isn't all that confident in standing up to her. I have been working with my daughter on this.\n\nTo get to the point, the one thing that does have me tearing my hair out about Jill, is her love of butter. When she comes over, it's not uncommon for her and my daughter to get snacks, and a good go-to is bread and butter. Which would be fine, except for Jill's intense love of butter. It's not unheard of for her to layer half a stick of butter on a single piece of bread, and then to have multiple pieces of such bread. \n\nTo her, butter is her favorite food in the world. She's Julia Child in this regard. She's also expressed butter is one of the foods that don't bother her (see aforementioned autism).\n\nThat's fine and all, but it kind of drives me crazy to see her go through so much butter when she comes over. Then I feel silly for being aggravated by that, because it's just the store-brand cheap butter.\n\nSo I've taken to monitoring the butter when she's over. Which puts my daughter in an awkward spot as Jill is older and is pretty good at getting my daughter to break out the bread and butter. All of which makes me feel rather AHish. I realize it's my house, my butter, my rules, but where's the hospitality in that?\n\nJill stays for dinner every now and then, so clearly I don't mind feeding her. I also have no reason to suspect she's starving at home, but I do know her mom limits the butter she buys.\n\nSo, neighbor kid loves butter and can really pack it in when at my house. Her autism may limit the food she will eat, so butter may be a big source of calories for her. So I tend to ration the butter and even put it away into hiding.\n\nWhy I may be TAH:\n\nI fear I am TAH for being the crazy butter lady.", "created_utc": 1680306315, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12845jm/aitah_for_being_the_butter_police/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It can be uncomfortable to deal with your kids friends doing things that are outside what you have done with your own kids and then if you add autism (or any other outside contributing factor that you are not personally well informed of or have personally experienced) it can get even harder.\n\nShort story long: NTA but figure out what is really bothering you. You can easily hide the butter and say you are out when they visit or just simply refuse it as a snack but you\u2019re not doing that so you need to ask yourself why.", "Soft YTA. Just keep butter on hand and make sure you don't run out. But as far as her liking butter, one of my cousins was the same way. For years, he would legit grab a stick of butter and eat it by itself. It was like candy to him. He has since mostly grown out of it but it's definitely normal for some kids to just be obsessed with certain foods. I have another cousin who specifically had his own jar of peanut butter because he would snack on it a lot so his parents would keep a jar just for him to eat out of. My go to was mostly ramon noodles and those totinos pizzas in the freezer section. I used to eat mostly just that. And was obsessed with eating a lot of microwaved popcorn at my grandma's.
