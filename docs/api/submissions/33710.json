Your mom is self-centered, it has nothing to do with you", " NTA, your Mother is hard work though. \n\nJust some advice, when people tend to buy everything for themselves, it can be next to impossible to buy for them on birthdays and Christmas. Ask if you can view her favourites list; she\u2019ll have one, they always do. Once you\u2019ve decided what to get from it, delete it from her list. That, or experiences are good too, rather than a gift.\n\nHaving said all that, I agree with others, if you\u2019d given in previously she would have then still expected a Xmas present too.

Yes you could have given to them on the day. You could have equally given them to her on Christmas Day. As the gift giver, it\u2019s your choice.

It would be reflective of her behavior!", "That got me too! Why was she asking when you got them? OP, is it possible that she snooped, knew you had them, and then asked that question just so she could be upset you didn\u2019t give them to her in time for her event? That sounds really likely considering her making it a point to specifically mention how great it would be to have those earrings for that event. Either way, you are not in the wrong at all, OP.", ">A gift requires a thank you, not a guilt dump.\n\nThere's a quotable quote."]}
