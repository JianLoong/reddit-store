The incident in question is that my niece (19f) needed to run something to a friend and I was parked in the back. Her mom/my sister asked if she could borrow my car so everybody wouldn't have to move theirs but I declined. I offered to take her or move the two cars parked behind the garage where hers was but she is not welcome to use my car. This goes double because she is a newer driver (only having her license for a year or so, though even if she wasn't I still wouldn't let her). I ended up moving the two cars as I understand it's annoying to have to move your car and my niece was able to leave no problem. \n\nHowever, my sister still insists that I was being annoying and particular about it.

Step son was moving, wanted to borrow it to move a couple large items. Nope. I'll be there at 2. Have the stuff ready to go.

This is exactly the point I was trying to make\u2026. So unbelievably selfish that you can\u2019t even see it and then call me childish. Try living your own rules", "There's a difference between moving a car that's not yours because the owner didn't want to do it and *asked you to* and loaning your car to someone who totalled your last one.

You get to makes your own rules and not follow them, your call. But you\u2019re an AH if you don\u2019t follow your own rules. Fyi read the passage, the person who previously totaled the vehicle is different than the niece currently requesting to drive.\n\n\nAlso Idk where OP is from, but in the states we have insurance which pays you if you total a car, unless you only have liability in which case the car probably had a minimal value and that\u2019s the risk you take. In this particular case, the t-boner also did not have insurance, which is illegal. So somebody following your way of thinking, \u201cyou need insurance but I don\u2019t\u201d, caused this all to begin with. So it\u2019s kinda like poetic justice."]}
