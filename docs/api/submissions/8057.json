Good luck to all of you.", "NTA I know about heartless/absent family members and I assure they're making a scandal just because they will not know how to answer people's questions such as \"where are the kids?\" and \"why that woman ended up adopting them?\". If they were closer they could easily fake the happy family show. Doesn't matter where they are, you're respecting his will.

I realize they are young, but knowing especially how the 6 year old feels about the move matters. If they are okay with it, then I\u2019d say NTA.

Best of luck in your retirement OP.", "NTA\n\nWhat they want is irrelevant. You adopted them so they are legally your children. Your children, your decision - the rest is irrelevant.\n\nBTW: I assume that the best friend is the Father (based on by you saying \"he\" when talking about the friend). You mention the mother separately as having died as well, so you are just following the children's parents' wishes.", "This seems like a situation that's way too complicated for this sub and I'm not going to venture a judgment, but I'd say it sounds like you're abiding by your friend's wishes.\n\nThis said, it also sounds like you are effectively making it impossible for those kids to have any kind of significant relationship with their biological family, because even if you say they're welcome to visit most people won't be able to travel hundreds of miles on a regular basis, and as you grow older you might find it hard to travel back regularly yourself. Don't underestimate how much of a difference 10 years can make to your health and autonomy! Is this really what you want, and what your friend would have wanted? Also what if something happens to you? All things worth considering imo.\n\nBut ultimately you're their legal parent, you're the one who knows the whole story and the decision is yours and yours alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
