Your daughter is not related to this woman who sadly passed, he is just thinking about him and his fellings. He needs to think about the future not the past. But you, you need to take care of what you feel, your daughter is not her daughter, she does not have to be put in grief is not healthy. Imagile learning you are named by your dad's late wife ...", "NTA. What is he planning to tell his daughter when she asks about her name? \"Well you see, honey, Daddy was planning on marrying someone before he met Mommy but she died, so then when you were born... sweetie? Sweetie? Stop crying!\"", "NTA. \nIm with you sister, its weird. This was not some family member like a mother ou grandmother, it was a fiance who tragically died. The fact that he said to you: \"Lila always wanted kids\" - \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 - guess what, this is not Lila's kid, so why bring that up?\n\nIts not up to you - his now wife who never met Lila - to honor her. She may have her own family to do so, and if not she has your husband/her fiance who will always remember her. \n\nIts not fair to you that he keeps insisting on this name while you said already you are not confortable with it. At the end of the day, you BOTH have to agreed on the name. If you say no, he will have to respect that.", "NTA\nA baby shouldn\u2019t be used as a vessel for a dead woman\u2019s memory.", "Nta\n\nHe should be allowed to remember her but your daughter together has nothing to do with that relationship and it's pretty weird.", "NTA. Hell no. He may want to honour Lila\u2019s memory, but I\u2019m assuming you never met her. He needs to leave her in the past.", "NTA\nYou need to both agree on the name, no matter what name you choose.", "Naming a baby requires both of you to say yes.  If one of you parents are not sure, then it\u2019s not the one.\n\nHowever I would not want to name my baby after my partners previous partner.", "NTA - Nope. I think your husband needs to see a therapist to help him cope with his grief. It is not unusual that this huge life event is stirring up feelings (grief, guilt, confusion) for him, but this is not a healthy way for him to deal with those feelings.", "NTA and you should be very careful with your husband. You have no obligation to honor the memory of a woman you had no connection with. Your child is not an object meant to bring honor to anybody and his proposal is really disrespectful", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019ve been supportive of him, and lovely that he wants to honor her.\n\nHowever, baby names are a \u201ctwo yeses\u201d situation. You presumedly did not know this woman at all. If she was still here, your marriage and child wouldn\u2019t even exist. It seems it reasonable that this would be uncomfortable to you.\n\nKindly turn him down and find a name you both love", "NTA\n\n \n>it's a way to honor her memory\n\n Why would you care about honoring her memory?? He can take some flowers to his grave. \n\n>Lila had always wanted kids.\n\nAnd how is this relevant?? \n\n Idk how the laws are where you live, but in my country is the dad the one who goes to register the baby. If that's the case where you live too, maybe have someone go with him. It's sad that lila died and all, but you don't have to spend your life and sacrifice your child to be a \"honoring\" to lila's life. \n\n I would reconsider my relationship with him too  if i were too. It's awful to live in someone's shadow. Think hard if you want you and your daughter to live honoring her memory all your lives", "NTA", "NTA wtf Is this, that's awful", "A lot of people saying use Lila as the middle name. Absolutely not! Every time the mother has to write the child\u2019s full name, she will be reminded of her husband\u2019s deceased fianc\u00e9e. This THEIR child. He can honor Lila by visiting and placing flowers on her grave site. \nI have never agreed with naming a a child after a deceased relative\u2026first or middle names, but that\u2019s just me. I hope that her husband can get some counseling and that they agree upon a name for their beautiful daughter.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely not. This is not his late fianc\u00e9es baby. It is nothing to do with her. And letting him put that pressure on his newborn to carry that memory is horrifically selfish of him. It has nothing to do with you being jealous. It's just a ridiculous suggestion.\n\nWhether you should remain with a man who would even consider suggesting that is another question altogether. For the record, I wouldn't. If he is that wrapped up in her memory, he isn't ready for a relationship, and he certainly isn't ready to be a father.", "NTA - this is both of your babies. It is not his job to make her memory live on in his child\u2019s name with another woman. Do not back down. No is no. It\u2019s a complete sentence and he needs to respect that.", "Nope NTA. It's more than a little weird and a ridiculous ask from your husband. If he's still carrying a torch for his deceased girlfriend then maybe he needs to talk to someone and find a way to let go. It kinda seems you're living in the shadow of Lila and that is unacceptable.", "No no no no no no no\n\nNTA at all\n\nBaby names should be, at bare minimum, a 2 yes game. \n\nThis is so effed up on so many levels. \n\nHe wants to name his child, your child, after the woman he was supposed to marry, and would be married to now if she hadn\u2019t sadly passed away? In what world is that appropriate to you or his future child?!?\n\nYou need to shut this down immediately and explain that it makes you very uncomfortable and it\u2019s highly inappropriate. \n\nIt almost feels to me like he\u2019s grieving again for the life he lost with Lila. That you two being parents has him reflecting on what could have been with her. \u201cLila always wanted kids\u201d \n\nEveryone grieves in their own way, but it is completely unfair to you to put that on you and your daughter. \n\nIf you\u2019re not already, therapy should be your first stop so that he can process what he\u2019s feeling and realize that he\u2019s acting insane. \n\nDo not let him do this to your daughter!!!!!!", "NTA - It would be weird and confusing, if my parents named me after a dead ex fiance... Stand your ground and find another name with him...", "NTA. This is something he should've brought up before the wedding.", "NTA. That is an extreme ask and pretty unreasonable", "Oh goodness NTA, I mean I\u2019m sorry for him that his previous partner died\u2026 but he has chosen to move on with you, and to put you in the position of asking you that is awful. OF COURSE you don\u2019t want your child to be named after another woman your partner had an intimate relationship with. Of course you don\u2019t want to be reminded of her constantly. You are absolutely NTA, stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nMaybe get him a pet he could name that.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like he wants to name your child after his dead grandma. Every time he hears his daughter\u2019s name, he\u2019ll think of his ex, not only her as a person but that she died. The same goes for you, the name is like a constant reminder of her.\n\nI\u2019d feel very uncomfortable with it. If he\u2019s absolutely insisting, what about using it as your daughter\u2019s middle name? I know that\u2019s not ideal, but way better than her first name", "NTA \n\nThat is definitely a difficult position to be in.. would either of you be ok with Lila being a middle name instead, maybe? I only ask as a potential middle ground, but honestly, if I were you, I would not be okay with it. It is one thing if you also knew Lila, but you didn't. \n\nHonestly, your husband should consider therapy. Like you said, I would be worried about him holding onto the past, too. We all can understand and emphasize that losing Lila was tragic, but he needs to let go and naming your daughter after her isn't going to honor her. \n\nAlso, I would also be worried about him becoming overprotective because he might be afraid of your daughter getting hurt like Lila when she becomes old enough to drive. It might even be a trigger when that time comes.", "NTA. If Lila was alive, she would not have wanted your husband to have kids with another woman so it\u2019s odd that your husband thinks he would be honoring her by giving your baby her name. It makes me wonder if your husband secretly wishes that your baby was Lila\u2019s baby. He needs to go to therapy asap. This isn\u2019t fair to you.", "NTA, it's weird he wants to name his daughter after the woman he loved romantically and had sex with, it's a bit yuck.  Different when you name a child after a patent but Lila is nothing to your daughter, besides obviously being someone your husband isn't over (grief aside)", "NTA   its a bit weird IMO.\n\npossible compromise is have Lila as a middle name.", "NTA. That's weird and uncomfortable and he shouldn't ask that of you. He's allowed to cherish memories of his late fianc\u00e9 but it is super uncomfortable to bring your child into that.", "NOT THE ASSHOLE", "NTA the is so f**ked up. What is you dude thinking under any circumstances to suggest to his pregnant wife we name her daughter after his dead fianc\u00e9. \ud83d\udea9", "OMG NTA AT ALL", "NTA. Who\u2019d want to name their child after their partners ex. \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA, I understand your husband, but that name should IMHO not be used for the baby. Maybe as a second name? I lost a son, and when my first grandson was born, he had that name as second name.", "NTA, if you don\u2019t love the idea you don\u2019t have to do it. Just say no and that you need to pick a name you both agree on.", "NTA he can find a way to honor HIS memories of her while also honoring this new step in life with you. This is a shared experience you\u2019re both having I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask for a name to honor his deceased ex", "NTA \n\nWhether she passed away, or they broke up, does not matter. You do not name your child after someone that you personally, and that child have no connection to. If it was a grandparent, a parent, or a sibling that\u2019s completely different.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to choose a different name", "He isn't ready to move past her.  He should not be in a relationship or having kids yet...\n\nNTA", "Ask him if he really wants to call his daughter by the name of someone whom he used to have sex with? As a comprise ( though you shouldn't have to) ask him if he remembers any names Lila liked for potential children, maybe she had better ideas.", "I would be a big hell no on that one too, so NTA. \n\nIt's too strange. Sorry for his loss, it's tragic, but his new daughter in a new relationship is not the way to remember his ex. Sounds like he needs more therapy to learn healthy coping mechanisms. \n\nSuggest planting a tree in the yard in her honour or something less weird than applying her name to your child.", "NAH \nI have lost my partner so I understand the grief and complexity in the situation and I can also understand why he would want to name his child after her to keep her memory alive almost. Losing a partner doesn't stop the love you have for them and it doesn't decrease the love you have for another person down the line but you can't try and replace them they are sadly gone and it's hard. I too have thought about naming my future child after my late partner however it is not only my choice and I can see how to some people it would be perceived as strange and weird so I think it's not a good idea to do that unless the partner was the child's bio parent.\n\nThis child is both of yours so you both get equal say in what you name her. If you feel uncomfortable with that name then it's your choice, you can choose to decide another name with him or maybe you can find a compromise to honour his late fiancee in a way that doesn't make you uncomfortable. It's not wrong for him to want to honour her but this isn't her child it's yours. Maybe you could choose a similar name for a middle name for your daughter or he could get a small tattoo of her favourite flower or birthstone.", "It\u2019s weird maybe at best a middle name NTA obviously", "NTA. But I don\u2019t like the way you communicated with your husband. You should\u2019ve just been straight up and told him you did not want to involve your daughter in his past life. \n\nTelling him it would be confusing for him. Sounds like you\u2019re trying to coach him up. It sounds patronizing. And it\u2019s disingenuous. This is all about how you feel and how your future daughter would feel. And these are absolutely valid emotions. You should just be upfront but make sure you\u2019re firm in your decision.", "Baby names should be agreed upon by both parents.\n\nIt is understandable why you don't want this name.\n\nHe should NOT be forcing you to accept this name.\n\nMaybe it can be used as a middle name, or maybe you BOTH can agree on something similar for example Delilah.\n\nYou are NTA for not wanting this name.", "NTA. I am all about couples needing to leave space in a partners life for their memories and feelings when they have lost a previous partner to death. It sounds like you do that. But naming a child after that person is too much. I wonder if, as much as he loves you and as excited as he likely is to be starting a family with you, this is a bit triggering for him at the same time in terms of his grief. It might be good for you guys to consider either individual or couples counseling. Grief can come back up in the most unexpected ways at unexpected times. And that\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, but it would be his responsibility to work on it for the health of your new family. Bc naming his daughter after his late fianc\u00e9 is not the way to process those feelings.", "NTA but you should both go to therapy to resolve this.", "NTA ewww that is so wrong you don't do that. I get he wants to honor her but NO not with your child. Maybe consider it as a middle or a second middle name. my kids have 3 names FIRST MIDDLE MIDDLE LAST", "Absolutely NTA. This would be my hill to die on. Don\u2019t burden the baby with this sad memory. Your husband\u2019s grief is understandable but naming baby after his late wife is NOT the right way to honor her memory.", "NTA. Your husband needs to respect you or that\u2019s it!", "NTA\n\nThis is so sad, understandable, yet weird all at the same time. He is always going to be looking for Lila in that baby. \n\nLet the name be a middle name if he is adamant, and give the little one a name of her very own.", "NTA. when you name a baby the name should resonate with both of you. I get he will always love Lila but that doesn't mean he needs to name your child after her.", "NTA. This would be a no go for me", "NTA - To name a kid after someone who has died is creepy, though the nice sentiment, to name it after a ex then that goes beyond creepy and weird. When you name a kid after someone you have things attached to that name and if is was an old SO then yeah I don't even want to go there.  You should ask him how would you feel if you wanted to call your child if it was a boy an ex's or late SO name and every time you called that name out you were reminded of your past relationship.", "NAH.\n\nMight have been more clear for him if you had instead emphasized that it would be especially confusing and painful for YOU, rather than telling him it would be especially confusing and painful for him. He's a big boy. He can gauge his feelings.\n\nYou haven't given us any evidence that he IS trying to recreate or replace what he had with Lila, so he's not the AH here.\n\nYour anxiety about being a surrogate for Lila and your other  confusion and pain on the matter are fine so you are not the AH.\n\nYou're both fine unless one of you refuses to communicate on this further. Then that person will be the AH.", "NTA! Frankly it sounds creepy.\n\nBest way to choose a baby name. You each suggest names. The one BOTH of you like is the final choice.", "To be honest this would be bell of divorce for me. After how long did you both met. He might got together with you to not to feel the grief and than now wanting to put his dead fianc\u00e9 between you and him and telling you the lady always wanted to have kids? Like wtf? This is your child that you are baring he have no right to do this or even suggest it lol.", "NTA\n\nIs it too late for an abortion? And a divorce? Because he is not over his first real love. js", "NAH - Lila has no relationship at all to your daughter, so you're not in the wrong for not wanting that name, however as you've accepted Lila was important to your husband and you respect that, and he's not the asshole wanting to remember her.\n\nTo me, this is exactly what middle names are for.", "NTA\n\nThis is a joint decision, so your no means Lila should be off the table as a baby name. Maybe see if he would be willing to compromise by allowing it as a middle name?", "Nobody is the Asshole here.\nA nice middle ground could be to have it as a middle name. It does honour to the memory of someone he loved without it being an everyday concern or thought for you \n\nMy wife's previous partner died in a motorcycle accident and if we had a boy I think his name would be a nice middle name but I wouldn't want it as a first name", "NAH. He never broke up with Lila. He lost her while he loved her. There is no closure and there never will be. I get why he would love to honor her memory. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to replace her or to recreate what they had. \n\nAt the same time, I understand why you don\u2019t want this. It\u2019s a painful reminder of another woman he loved enough to want to marry. \n\nIn the end of the day, you\u2019re not competing with her. She\u2019s no longer here. Maybe a good compromise would be to use Lila as a second name?", "NAH. I personally think his idea is odd and I would refuse it same as you OP. I don't however think that there is anything shady about it. That being said, I don't think he has thought through the effect of hearing her name everyday... You need to talk some more and if you feel uncomfortable then that's that.\n\nThere are billions of names and millions of ways to honor Lila.", "NTA \nIs using Leila as a second name an option? Maybe that\u2019s a good compromise - nobody cares about 2nd names in real life but it still would hold some significance", "NAH, I would really consider a middle name, or a name that incorporates hers some how", "Not at all. She means nothing to you and the child is both of yours. Maybe a middle name? But YANBU.", "My husband did a legal name change a few years back, and he chose a middle name to honor his late former girlfriend. I helped him come up with it - he went with the middle name \u201cFrederick\u201d because she lived on a street called Frederick. I think it\u2019s a great way to honor her while also not being so obvious about it. Maybe you could discuss something similar with your husband. A middle name after something relevant to his late fianc\u00e9 that isn\u2019t just her name.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
