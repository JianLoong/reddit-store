During the pandemic I fell down a Netflix/youtube rabbit hole and ended up rediscovering my love for comic book movies and comics in general. When everything opened up I decided to start collecting single issue comic books, in particular the original run of Hellblazer. I\u2019m really lucky to have an amazing comic shop near me and one day I went in and noticed that they had an original copy of the first issue. I couldn\u2019t afford it at the time (around \u00a370) but I saved up and eventually managed to get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend is not interested in comics he has often remarked that he finds it odd that I collect them, he thinks it\u2019s childish. I tried to explain my love of it but in the end I gave up.\n\nAbout a week ago, I looked in my wardrobe where I keep them and they were gone. I asked him where they were and he said he\u2019d got rid of them. I was devastated, this was two years of work that I had put into a collection and something that was very dear to me. He simply said that it was a childish hobby and something I should\u2019ve grown out of years ago. I\u2019ll admit I said some pretty unkind things and then stormed out. I went to the pub and turned off my phone, after a couple of hours I turned it back on again to find loads of missed calls and texts saying that I was overreacting and that I was only proving his point that I was childish in the way I had behaved. The last text said he was staying at a friend\u2019s house while I cooled down because he \u2018couldn\u2019t be arsed with my dramatics\u2019\n\n After thinking for a long time I texted him back to say that we were over, I had no interest in being with someone who disrespects my property or my interests and that he could come and pick up his stuff between 6pm and 10pm that evening. He replied with \u2018fine, if you\u2019re really going to end a 4 year relationship over something so petty then you\u2019re not the person I thought you were.\u2019\n\nOur relationship had been rocky for a couple of months by then I think this was just the final nail in the coffin.\n\nI went home and packed his clothes and electronics, now this may be where I was the arsehole. I decided that I didn\u2019t want to see him so I left his belongings on the doorstep which is covered by a porch. When I left for work the next morning his stuff was still there so I texted him to remind him but got no answer, halfway through my shift my phone started blowing up with texts and calls from him and his friend saying that I was a bitch for leaving his stuff outside \u2018what if it had rained/what if someone had taken it etc.\u2019\n\nAll his stuff was in sealed cardboard boxes and I taped plastic binbags over them so if there was rain then they wouldn\u2019t get damaged, we also live in a quiet neighbourhood where everyone knows each other and it wasn\u2019t bin day so I doubt anyone would have taken them. I asked my friends their opinions and they\u2019re split so I\u2019m coming here.", "created_utc": 1670117943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbwyde/aita_for_leaving_my_boyfriends_belongings_on_the/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It took him a suspiciously short period of time to go from being your partner to treating you like a hapless child in need of not only guidance but actual DISCIPLINING and CORRECTION. That doesn't just make him an AH, it makes him abusive and a potential danger. If he could sell your belongings out from underneath you - things which hadn't been bought with his money, and which he had no legal claim nor title to - in order to \"correct your behaviour\", then how long would it be before he was physically punishing you \"for your own good\"? \n\nI won't address the many reasons why he was objectively wrong about your hobby. What I will say is that he has absolutely not a leg to stand on in coming after you for putting his belongings outdoors, and the reason why is simple:\n\nHe didn't treat you or your belongings with even the most basic semblance of respect or consideration; therefore he had neither right nor reason to expect that you treat him or his belongings with anything but the same contempt and indifference. He got EXACTLY the treatment that he invited. Perhaps this will teach him to be more thoughtful of how he treats others in future; I doubt it, though. You are NTA.", "NTA. He's lucky you didn't get rid of his \"childish\" things such as everything he had at your place. He was completely in the wrong, and it's shocking that he'd think he had the right to throw away your comics.", "Fuck that dude. He obviously sold them.  He's lucky you didn't press charges", "No one should mess with or throwaway your belongings, regardless of your relationship status. Hobbies are personal and provided they aren't hurting anyone, they DON'T need any amount of justification.\n\nRemoving that individual from your life was absolutely the right decision, and you gave them more consideration than the situation deserved. You don't need that kind of negativity in you life.\n\nI would recommend CBRs, digital comics, not the same tactile satisfaction, but at least you'll have them backed up and safely out of reach of any AH who disrespects your pastimes.", "NTA...first additions of comics in great shape are sometimes very valuable.  If the dumbass would have taken the time to research he would have found that out before throwing somebody else's collection away.\n\nGlad you kicked his shit to the curb.\nBy the way if he's a grown adult and still wastes a lot of time gaming...who really is the child here...the collector or the player?", "NTA.", "NTA    and please charge him with theft.\n\nMy husband is something of a pack rat, and as much joy as it would bring me, I would never throw out his stuff.\n\nI would have kept something of his, that was equal value to your comics, until he replaced or repaid for them.", "Nta and he is an assholw", "NTA, and his behavior is utterly atrocious, if not criminal. Your boyfriend 100% deserves to be dumped, and you showed his stuff WAY more respect then he showed yours, and you are WAY nicer than I would have been towards him and his shit. You should also dump any one of your \"friends\" who is siding with him.", "NTA - you are a much kinder person than me. I would have dumped his shit all over the lawn.
