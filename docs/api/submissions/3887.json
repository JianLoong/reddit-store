During the pandemic I fell down a Netflix/youtube rabbit hole and ended up rediscovering my love for comic book movies and comics in general. When everything opened up I decided to start collecting single issue comic books, in particular the original run of Hellblazer. I\u2019m really lucky to have an amazing comic shop near me and one day I went in and noticed that they had an original copy of the first issue. I couldn\u2019t afford it at the time (around \u00a370) but I saved up and eventually managed to get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend is not interested in comics he has often remarked that he finds it odd that I collect them, he thinks it\u2019s childish. I tried to explain my love of it but in the end I gave up.\n\nAbout a week ago, I looked in my wardrobe where I keep them and they were gone. I asked him where they were and he said he\u2019d got rid of them. I was devastated, this was two years of work that I had put into a collection and something that was very dear to me. He simply said that it was a childish hobby and something I should\u2019ve grown out of years ago. I\u2019ll admit I said some pretty unkind things and then stormed out. I went to the pub and turned off my phone, after a couple of hours I turned it back on again to find loads of missed calls and texts saying that I was overreacting and that I was only proving his point that I was childish in the way I had behaved. The last text said he was staying at a friend\u2019s house while I cooled down because he \u2018couldn\u2019t be arsed with my dramatics\u2019\n\n After thinking for a long time I texted him back to say that we were over, I had no interest in being with someone who disrespects my property or my interests and that he could come and pick up his stuff between 6pm and 10pm that evening. He replied with \u2018fine, if you\u2019re really going to end a 4 year relationship over something so petty then you\u2019re not the person I thought you were.\u2019\n\nOur relationship had been rocky for a couple of months by then I think this was just the final nail in the coffin.\n\nI went home and packed his clothes and electronics, now this may be where I was the arsehole. I decided that I didn\u2019t want to see him so I left his belongings on the doorstep which is covered by a porch. When I left for work the next morning his stuff was still there so I texted him to remind him but got no answer, halfway through my shift my phone started blowing up with texts and calls from him and his friend saying that I was a bitch for leaving his stuff outside \u2018what if it had rained/what if someone had taken it etc.\u2019\n\nAll his stuff was in sealed cardboard boxes and I taped plastic binbags over them so if there was rain then they wouldn\u2019t get damaged, we also live in a quiet neighbourhood where everyone knows each other and it wasn\u2019t bin day so I doubt anyone would have taken them.

It took him a suspiciously short period of time to go from being your partner to treating you like a hapless child in need of not only guidance but actual DISCIPLINING and CORRECTION. That doesn't just make him an AH, it makes him abusive and a potential danger. If he could sell your belongings out from underneath you - things which hadn't been bought with his money, and which he had no legal claim nor title to - in order to \"correct your behaviour\", then how long would it be before he was physically punishing you \"for your own good\"? \n\nI won't address the many reasons why he was objectively wrong about your hobby. What I will say is that he has absolutely not a leg to stand on in coming after you for putting his belongings outdoors, and the reason why is simple:\n\nHe didn't treat you or your belongings with even the most basic semblance of respect or consideration; therefore he had neither right nor reason to expect that you treat him or his belongings with anything but the same contempt and indifference. He got EXACTLY the treatment that he invited. Perhaps this will teach him to be more thoughtful of how he treats others in future; I doubt it, though. You are NTA.", "NTA. He's lucky you didn't get rid of his \"childish\" things such as everything he had at your place.

He's lucky you didn't press charges", "No one should mess with or throwaway your belongings, regardless of your relationship status. Hobbies are personal and provided they aren't hurting anyone, they DON'T need any amount of justification.\n\nRemoving that individual from your life was absolutely the right decision, and you gave them more consideration than the situation deserved. You don't need that kind of negativity in you life.\n\nI would recommend CBRs, digital comics, not the same tactile satisfaction, but at least you'll have them backed up and safely out of reach of any AH who disrespects your pastimes.", "NTA...first additions of comics in great shape are sometimes very valuable.

I'm guessing since you used \u00a3s you are in the UK also.", "NTA!!!!!! by a long shot!!!!!! \n\ni\u2019ve spent the last 6 years collecting albums/merch of my favourite kpop group. it doesn\u2019t even come close to some collections i\u2019ve seen for this group specifically, but i\u2019ve spent a shit ton of time AND money on it, that if i lost it the way you lost your comics, i\u2019d be so mad there\u2019d be literal steam coming out of my ears!! \n\npartners who don\u2019t respect their partners hobbies, whether they also like said hobby or not, aren\u2019t worth the time. don\u2019t give up something you love/makes you happy just to please someone!!! i\u2019m sorry but your bf DESERVED to have his stuff rained on. what an AH. \n\n(also i really hope he didn\u2019t do something to your stuff, and that you get it back. i don\u2019t know if it came off properly or not, but i\u2019m so mad on your behalf. good luck internet stranger \ud83e\udee1)", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter what he thinks of what you collect, your interests, whatever. He has no right to go through a closet\u2014which isn\u2019t even in his way\u2014to gather things to get rid of because he feels you shouldn\u2019t have them?! Getting rid of him was the right thing to do; you were considerate in how you packed his stuff for him to retrieve. You need to press charges on him, though, for what he stole and disposed of. Oh\u2026and this is coming from someone significantly older than OP and has a complex storage system for her comics.", "NTA. If he couldn't be bothered to respect your property, then why should you be bothered to respect his?", "NTA. You took great care in packing his things nicely and ensuring they were weatherproof after he got rid of an entire hobby you'd rekindled for two years because he's not into them. You did the right thing imo by breaking up with him as if you'd stayed he would have known he could continue getting rid of stuff he didn't like that was important to you and maybe even progressed to more controlling behaviors.", "I\u2019m a massive reader (comics included and I have a small collection of them and manga) and my husband knows this. He\u2019s not a reader like I am and while he gives me grief, he also got me extra bookshelves to store them on and later on special sealed totes to take down to the basement. We had a baby and the room was converted over so things got shuffled. It was never a question, he just helped pack them and helped me pick favorites to go on a smaller bookcase in the living room while the rest went downstairs in sealed containers to keep them safe.\n\nWe all have our hobbies and we respect them. NTA OP", "NTA, you gave him a fair opportunity to get his stuff. Probably should have told him you were leaving it on the porch but understandable under the circumstances.", "nta - what he did was total disregard of your property and just ridding them without your consent \\*which i think he sold and pocketed the cash\\*......he deserved what he got", "nta his stuff has no place in your home even if he's helped with bills. by that point u2 were no longer together and he would've been kicked o soon anyway. that and he should be thankful u generously packed his garbage for hom", "Get new friends to replace the ones who think you overreacted.", "Listen, it doesn't take a huge comic fan (of which I am one) to know that tossing your stuff with out asking, thinking or even questioning you live if the stuff to be a huge red flag of disrespect, at the very keast", "NTA Dude disrespects your private property but you should just wait around until he can pick up his?  You did the right thing, but as others have said, pursue getting restitution for your belongings if possible.", "I strongly suggest you inventory all of your valuables to see what else, if anything, he stole from you.  NTA.  You also treated his possessions much better than he treated yours, if he indeed threw your comic books away instead of selling them.  Frankly, I think he knew how much you paid for one of them  (\u00a370) and wouldn\u2019t just throw that type of money away.", "NTA what is with him anyway like the absolute gall he must have to think he gets to decide what you should collect or be interested in.  I would have been tempted to torch his shit. fuck that guy", "I got secondhand anger reading this as a fellow comic book lover. Anyone who goes so far out their way to remove you from a hobby doesn\u2019t deserve to be in your life. As if every single one of his hobbies is ONLY for adults (I doubt it).\nScrew that guy and honestly if his stuff was stolen he\u2019d deserve it. NTA\n\nAlso, you may have already read it because it\u2019s super popular but since you like Hellblazer I recommend Preacher by Garth Ennis. Great stuff.", "NTA. You dodged that bullet like you were in the Matrix dude, good for you! He's attempting to play passive/aggressive bullshit games with you. Block him, block his friends, and probably ought to change your lock. I am sorry for your loss though, loosing a collection SUCKS!", " It\u2019s not about the comics. It\u2019s that he disrespected you so much that he stole from you. NTA. I hope you sue him.", "NTA, but really, who gives a shit? His stuff didn't get stolen and disappeared, now did it? You were majorly dissed and psychologically abused. Don't let this creep gaslight you!!! \n\nHe really did throw out books you had found and saved and loved, and they weren't hurting him. He violated your trust and saying mean things to you now is no way to make things better. This is really goodbye.", "NTA and this was refreshing and nice to see that you didn't allow this bs from him and you actively decided not to be a doormat..good for you", "File a police report. This is theft. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.  Obviously NTA.", "esh. what he did was terrible and you\u2019re right to end things with him, but packing up someone\u2019s valuables and leaving them on the porch also makes you an asshole. he was gross for throwing out your things but there was no reason he couldn\u2019t enter your house, he was not being abusive or violent or anything of the sort", "I agree\u2014 this is robbery, plain and simple.", "THIS! I would be LIVID. My brother and I have quite the collection of comic books (I'm female, don't ever let anyone insinuate it's \"not a girl thing\"). And you had some first editions! Drag his ass to small claims and see how he likes being ripped into by a judge!\n\nAlso, because I have to say it: geeks unite!", "More likely he stole and sold.", "Yeah, my husband collected baseball cards as a kid. He still sometimes wants to buy a surviving one for his collection. I don't get the point of it, but if that's what he wants for his birthday, I'll get it for him. It's a harmless hobby that makes him happy.", "You should edit your comment to Y T A because it will get counted against her when it looks like you think she is not the AH", ">but there was no reason he couldn\u2019t enter your house, he was not being abusive or violent or anything of the sort\n\nExcept he steals her comics and gets rid of them? No need to give him an opportunity of hating her fridge and getting rid of it too.", "I would visit your comic store to let them know (that seems the most logical place to sell them) and also post on your local Facebook buy/sell groups and/or Nextdoor. \n\nHope you can find your collection!", "Change the locks!", "Did he throw them out? Or sell them and pocket the money? NTA either way", "If you got them all from the same store, the store may have records of your transactions.", "Honestly think you must. If for no other reason than to educate him. And bill him for the highest accurate value. No discounts.", "How many comics did he end up throwing away? What was the estimated value?", "OP at least get in touch with citizens advice bureau asap, you can message them on the website and they will reply within a week!", "Dude forreal- I'm a 30 year old woman with over 400 comic books & an even more extensive collection of Pok\u00e9mon cards.   \n\nMy husband makes me cute things like cedar chests & shelves to store & display them with.  \n\nPlease go after this jerk, OP!   \n\nNTA", "you\u2019re just being obtuse. what he did was terrible but there is no reason to believe he would harm her or her property. his grievance was very specific, there was no fear of him trashing her house, let\u2019s be honest", "Yup. Most of the stuff I have from my favorite sportsball team probably isn't worth much, but I have my ticket to a World Series game and the memorabilia that was handed out at that, and that's probably worth something. I would kick someone out who told me my little collection of sportsball stuff should be trashed, but if they did it for me, I'd absolutely figure out the value of those items and ask the police to determine whether it was a misdemeanor or a felony!", "Hes a known thief. Thieves don't get invited back in and its important for him to have the point hammered in that is what he is", "then you set up a time for him to come and be present. you don\u2019t just leave someone\u2019s  valuables in the porch. if they were stolen SHE would be liable"]}
