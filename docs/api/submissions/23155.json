I just moved in with a roommate and he told me that I can't brush my teeth or shower after 10pm because it makes too much noise and keeps him up. This seems very unreasonable. I am an adult with a 9-5, and I have to do freelance work on the side in order to survive, and sometimes I just can't be ready for bed before 10.

Pipes can be pretty noisy and it can be just from the hot water. \n\nBut also you may choose to not use the bathroom after 10 but what if you start getting up at 5am. Are they going to insist that you don\u2019t shower in the morning also?", "NTA. I\u2019ve had a similar experience to this, although more from your roommate\u2019s perspective.\n\nBoth my roommate and I have our own separate bedrooms with a bathroom in between, and it just so happens that the wall containing the water pipes is also the wall that separates my room from the bathroom. This means that whenever my roommate turns on the faucet to shower or wash her hands I can hear the water traveling through the pipes\u2014and this can be super loud, especially when she comes home late and decides to take a bath at 3 am. In the morning, my roommate is also someone who slams cabinet doors and clacks her toothbrush around a cup full of water to clean it off. I\u2019ve been woken up by this on multiple occasions, and at times it can be super annoying, but the reality is that some people by habit are just loud. Or the building may not have the best soundproofing. And it\u2019s not necessarily anyone\u2019s fault, more of an adjustment period where new roommates get used to each other\u2019s habits. \n\nI do have to say, it\u2019s unusual to run to the landlord when interpersonal disagreements arise. But my recommendation is to get to know your roommate. Invite them to a meal together, get to know where they\u2019re from and what their interests are. You don\u2019t have to be friends, but it certainly does help when both parties are cordial. \n\nRemember that no one is doing this intentionally or out of spite\u2014you two just need to be compassionate with each other and communicate to reach an understanding. Both of you pay rent, so it would be unreasonable to dictate what times you\u2019re allowed to shower. Besides, even if your landlord got a new tenant the same issue would likely also arise.", "NTA. This is not a big deal, if he doesn't want the noise of a room mate then he has to get his own place. He doesnt' get to dictate what time you do things inside.\n\nA shower after 10pm, that's not even remotely an issue.\n\niF the landlord is happy enough to let you go, take the opportunity to leave, he's clearly going to be a damn nightmare to live with.\n\n99.999% of room mates won't be that ridiculous. A lot of room mates will suck, but I've never met one who complains that you shower after 10pm.", "You are living with a real-life Sheldon Cooper! Do you have a roommate agreement with this person? Are you in an apartment and how did you find this roommate situation? Does the landlord live in the building? And why the hell would the landlord involve themself in roommate disagreement. You have every right to live your life, as long as you are being respectful. If you were playing music or video games at 11:30, then I'd say you were wrong, but NTA for wanting to use your bathroom after 10.", "Well he's complaining to the landlord so much that she wants to evict me. This is only my third night in the place!!!", "I literally woke up in the middle of the night to pee and was scared to flush the toilet! It's ridiculous. \n\nIt also feels very creepy and like an invasion of privacy. My personal hygiene is PERSONAL.", "I have a water pick so that sometimes makes a lot of noise. But I don't have control over that.", "The landlord also complained that I left MY suitcases in the living room, when it's supposed to be a \"common area.\" Like COME ON, I am a grown adult that pays my own rent. Not a 10 year old child. I feel like I am going to have ZERO freedom in this place.", "Excuse me? A grown ass adult can't brush their teeth or shower in their own home?  They pay their share to live there. Come on, the roommate is unstable.. Calling the landlord because they wanted a pillow?", "If I were you, I'd leave then. Seriously, if you are already on the landlords bad book, living there would be a nightmare", "im shocked your landlord would want to evict you over wanting to use the bathroom past 10pm. If i was the landlord id laugh in your roommates face and tell them to figure it out.", "It is creepy and an invasion. \n\nI once experimented something similar. It was awful. \nWe were visiting some friends, staying at their place. They didn\u2019t warned us the wife forbidden the use of the restroom after the kid was in bed (quite early), while refusing to tell us at what time it was.\n\nWe arrived after 8h of travel. She put their child in bed when we were bringing the luggage in (straight after saying hi) and then announced we were not allowed anymore to use the toilet until morning, when we asked to use it. \nThe fallowing days we were forbidden to us the toilet without warnings -as early as 6pm. \n\nShe wanted us to go in the dark, to the end of the garden, after a little field we were warned was full of snakes, under a tree with a wasp nest, where there a ditch with a stream. She would wait behind the toilet door, and was absolutely mad if the flush was used at nighttime (the toilet was not next to her room so once you entered the toilet we could hear her coming and waiting angrily - and it wasn\u2019t to use it herself). Mind you the child never wake up, even if her yelling was louder than the flushing. \n\nAnd she seriously thought she was really reasonable.", "Meh. That shouldn't be enough for roommate to get her panties in a twist.", "This landlord is seriously micromanaging. You just moved in! My dorm managers weren\u2019t this overloading when I was a freshman in college!", "And rent is 1,350!!!! It's not like it's cheap.", "But honestly, don't you feel like this is an invasion of privacy? My personal hygiene is private, and them paying so much attention to it is really creepy IMO.", "Well I just moved here and it would be exhausting to move again. And I just started a new job on Monday so I don't have the time. I added to my post, but he called the landlord to come over at 11:30 because I was showering. \n\nAnd he complained to her that I asked him if I could borrow a pillow. \n\nIt seems like she might kick me out.", "She also got angry at me for leaving my suitcases in the common room, because I'm not supposed to have anything personal in the \"common area.\" I'm a growing ass adult who pays rent!", "Oh she didn't complain about using the actual toilet. Just the shower and teeth brushing.", "Right? Like all the noises I am making are hygiene related. I'm not blasting music or talking on the phone.", "It's not normal, but he's been there longet and seems to be on short leg woth the landlord, fighting this would be more exhausting I guess", "Don\u2019t ask to borrow stuff. Call the landlord yourself and ask her why your housing is being threatened over you taking an shower in your own apartment at a normal time of night? \n\nBut honestly, as much of a pain as it is, you might want to break your lease. This is absurd.\n\nNTA", "Well you are indeed paying to use the space. \n\nUnless it\u2019s specified on your contract, their expectation about showers time and use of commun space are unreasonable at best. \n\nAre your landlord and roommate related? I fail to see any other explanation for their behaviours.", "NTA\u2026why didn\u2019t he mention this before moving in?  And what does the landlord have to do with it?", "I genuinely don't know why you'd come to Reddit for this. Huge red flag \ud83d\udea9 time to find a new roomie.", "This alone is all you need to know that this situation isn't gonna work for you! FIND ANOTHER ROOMMATE", "Baffles me how you can use the toilet at all, washing your hands evidently isn't allowed.\n\nYour flatmate is a massive asshole and the landlord is as well. You're NTA.", "Alllll the more reason to get tFffff outta there ASAP luv. This won't get better, wrong or right, it's just gonna get worse. Run.", "It is inconsiderate to shower that late", "Sounds like the landlord may be a close friend or relative cuz this def isn't normal...", "1350 is not expensive", "10pm is the middle of the day, a perfectly acceptable showering time.", "all the more reason you should leave", "I'm not sure she could legally kick you out for taking a shower \ud83d\udebf after 10pm. It definitely does NOT break noise laws. And you do pay rent so I can't figure out why she would complain where your suitcase is. And unless she has been in your apartment why would she even know where it is?"]}
