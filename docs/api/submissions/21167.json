As a responsible parent, I've had \"the talk\" with her and made sure she knows how to properly handle her menstrual hygiene.\n\nNow, here's where the issue arises. Emma's uncle, my brother-in-law, John, comes over to our house often, as he's close to the family. He was staying with us for a few days recently. One morning, John pulled me aside with a look of disgust on his face and said that he accidentally saw used tampons in the trash can in Emma's bathroom.\n\nHe told me it was \"disgusting\" and that I should do something about it, like making sure Emma disposes of them more discreetly. I was taken aback by his reaction and tried to explain that menstruation is a natural part of life for women, and there's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. I reminded him that Emma's bathroom is her private space, and it's essential for her to feel comfortable and secure in her own home.\n\nHowever, John persisted and said that it's still gross, and he shouldn't have to be confronted with such things when he visits. He even suggested that I keep the trash can empty while he's around, which I found absurd and unreasonable.\n\nThis is where things escalated. I got frustrated and told John that if he couldn't handle a few used tampons in a bathroom trash can, then maybe he should reevaluate his attitudes and grow up. I might have used some strong words and was rather blunt in expressing my frustration.\n\nNow, my spouse, John's parents, and even some of our friends think I was out of line for speaking to John like that. They say I should have been more understanding of his discomfort, even if they don't necessarily agree with his perspective.\n\nI'm just kind of baffled and at a loss for words, and stumbling to form thoughts on this whole debacle.", "created_utc": 1688328192, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14oxpef/aita_for_telling_my_brotherinlaw_to_get_over_my/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s very normal and absolutely nothing to be frightened of! We learn to take care of it and even properly dispose of it in the trash, just like he does when he gets a cut or a nosebleed! Aren\u2019t women amazing!?!\n\nNow here\u2019s a hug, a cookie, and a juice box! Go back outside and play with your friends? Awww, aren\u2019t they cute when they grow up? \ud83e\udd79\n\nNTA.", "NTA, I would ban that man from my house. He should act like a proper guest if he wants to visit", "Absolutely NTA. His behavior is creepy. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "He's the AH. Not you. If he didn't want to see them he can stop looking in the trash can.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking! John being in the room and snooping in the trash seriously freaks me out", "It is something that comes up again over and over in here. I am genuinely mystified by it. Also, disgusted tbh", "This was my thought too. It was only gross if she walked up swinging it and smacked him in the face.", "This happened to me once. I was mortified when I realized. I forgot to move it to the trash I was taking outside. Found it later that night and was so grossed out.\n\nMy 40-something-male roommate never even spoke about it. He\u2019d have had more right to complain about that than this creepy uncle does about finding properly disposed of tampons in her own trash.", "Oh hell. Even on the sink, big deal.\n\nI've seen so many tampons accidentally left on the sink when my daughters were teenagers. They're not nuclear waste.", "Good thing this person would never be in my house. \nIf my daughter chooses to use tampons I\u2019ll be asking her to throw them in the kitchen trash. \ud83d\ude02\nThe bathroom trash sometimes takes a couple weeks to fill up and the kitchen trash goes out at least every other day.", ">Quite why men in the twenty-first century find it surprising/abhorrent that women have periods is utterly beyond my comprehension.\n\nLuckily, not all men. But i too find it bizarre that any do.", ">fuck John.\n\nAmen to that. Everything about this post makes my skin crawl.", ">Wait until midnight, go into the woods, and bury them just to make John comfortable?\n\nCant she just hold it in? /s", "yeah this !!!", "Depends.  In her private bathroom why bother.  At someone else's house, maybe depending on who's house. My bestie who my cycle is synced up with hers, probably not. Anyone else yes, because some people are grossed out by blood, menstrual or otherwise.", " That\u2019s standard practice if you\u2019re in public or at someone\u2019s house, because you aren\u2019t the one emptying the trash. But in my own home? That\u2019s just a waste of toilet paper dude", "In my day they were wrapped up like mummies, but that has probably changed with the recent unpleasantness and low stock of tissue. Also, kids are taught to be more environmentally friendly now.", "Accidentally auto-corrected + I have dyslexia, my bad! Changed!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "But wtf was his motive for looking through the trash? \n\nI know it doesnt make much sense in context, but part of me suspects he was actively looking for used tampons.\n\nHe must have had a motive or been looking for something.\n\nTbh I wish I hadnt started thinking about it. Ugh", "Hard agree, I would not be comfortable being around this man knowing he was rummaging through my kid's trash, the lack of boundaries is astounding.", "The daughter may not have a private bathroom, and if he's staying there for several days, then that bathroom might be the one that guest bedroom uses as well.\n\n(not saying his reaction is warranted, just that I didn't immediately jump to him \"snooping\")\n\nThe other thing I thought of was perhaps the daughter needs to be sure that she's disposing of the tampons (or pads if she uses them) wrapped adequately in toilet paper.\nIf daughter is just getting used to dealing with period, then maybe she's not wrapping them in tp, or not wrapping them well.\n\nThe uncle is still TA though, for sure. And definitely an overreaction to a normal biological process.", "Can this officially be the way we respond to this nonsense from these very very fragile men from now on please?", "As a woman, I can tell you, it is important to wrap it into a paper before disposal, because otherwise you must scrub the blood from your trash, if, let's say, the bag tears for whatever reason.", "Just because it's called her bathroom, it might also be the one for that area of the house. Growing up, mine was also the only one in the basement and not an en suite, so it was used by other family and guests. It also may have just been at the top of the trashcan. Obviously, NTA and his reaction is unwarranted and weird, just offering some possibilities because it doesn't change that fact.", "Also thinking back, I would feel so incredibly violated and ashamed if I knew my uncle who was staying over went through my trash in my own bathroom, that he doesn't share with me, found my tampons and then complained about it because he felt disgusted by it, it's so out of line, I'm no mother but I would've thrown him out, immediately.", "She shouldn\u2019t have to perfectly wrap her tampon into a discrete package just for the creepy men that come into her house. You can wrap them n it\u2019s still obviously a bloody tampon", "She said Emma\u2019s bathroom is her private space so it sounds like it\u2019s her own", "Op says that it's specifically Emma's bathroom.", "I dont insist on my theory being right at all - because it makes so little sense."]}
