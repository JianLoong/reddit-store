Also, do we need a new doctor or is this normal? \n\nBackground context: my daughter, J, is four months old and had previously seen this pediatrician, Dr X, three times. I happen to be a special education teacher who works primarily in early childhood and with early intervention autism. Dr X seemed constantly annoyed at previous visits. He would roll his eyes for verbiage I would use, such as \u201cJ tracks my voice but doesn\u2019t track other sounds\u201d or for asking questions like \u201cI read online that such and such is okay, is that right?\u201d Dr. X also made comments about us being first time parents who \u201cgoogle everything and worry about anything.\u201d \n\n\nWhat happened: We were at J\u2019s four month appointment. Dr X mentions she has eczema, so I asked what he recommends for overall lotions. He mentioned a few brands that I wrote down, as well as a prescription. He didn\u2019t mention what to put on her dry spots, so I pulled a picture of a new balm I got from my phone and asked, \u201cthis is what I had previously used on her dry spots, is this one okay?\u201d Dr X kept his back turned to me and repeated his recommendations. \n\nI then asked \u201cdo I need to change my diet?\u201d To which he responded \u201cDr Google.\u201d I actually was asking that because my nephew had bad eczema and I remembered my sister-in-law doing that, but I didn\u2019t want to annoy him more so I just laughed it off and said something like \u201cyeah there\u2019s too much information.\u201d\n \nHe continued checking on my daughter and explaining what he was checking, like having her grip his fingers and saying \u201creflexes look good.\u201d At one point he said, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have a head lag\u201d to which I responded said \u201coh that\u2019s good.\u201d My husband asked me \u201cwhy is that good?\u201d And I answered \u201cit can be early indication of autism if there\u2019s a head lag after six months, so that\u2019s good she already doesn\u2019t have one\u201d and then the doctor corrected me and said something like \u201cit can be a sign of neurological divergence after six months.\u201d Okay, fair. I began to ask Dr X advice on J\u2019s sleep and how she\u2019s having trouble transitioning out of the swaddle. He kind of cut me off and said \u201cturn the room cooler.\u201d And I responded \u201coh, it\u2019s because the room should be cooler? And that\u2019ll help her transition?\u201d And he put the baby down and walked out of the room. \n\nAt first we thought he was coming back, but then the nurse popped in and said we were \u201cfree to leave.\u201d\n\nMy husband thinks I probably came off like a know-it-all asshole who challenges everything, and the doctor is fed up with me. He also thinks the relationship is \u201cruined\u201d and we need a new doctor. I\u2019d obviously prefer to not be the asshole here, but if I am, what can I do to be better next time? And do we really need a new pediatrician?\n\n(Edited to clarify the lotion exchange)", "created_utc": 1686537283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/147cpxs/aita_for_what_i_said_to_my_daughters_pediatrician/", "score": 463, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I asked which procedure he would be doing because I had read about a few for the same condition..he cut me off and repeatedly said you\u2019re not a doctor. \n\nSecond time I went to a doctor, probably 12 years after that because I had metal poisoning a few times (I\u2019m a welder and sometimes exposures are unavoidable) so I was worried about my organ function. Told him I noticed I couldn\u2019t process alcohol like a normal person. Tell me why am otherwise healthy 30 year old can go from being able to party with family to being blackout drunk off a six pack of normal beer and being sick for more than two days. I don\u2019t drink often so it took a few years to figure out that I just can\u2019t drink anymore. I can have two beers now without getting slurring speech drunk. Still not normal in my non doctor opinion. My family had to call his office so he could change the notes he added to my records stating I was an alcoholic.

Done that.)", "Seems like you already understand what the problem is.  Sure your pediatrician doesn't sound good at dealing with people, and you and your pediatrician have incompatible personalities, and you need a new one.  But this is also about you.\n\n1.

You do sort of come across as a know it all in your presentation of the story, but the doc's responses to your questions and information sharing seem inappropriate regardless.\n\nYou are the best proponent for your child's healthcare.

In my opinion. I\u2019ve always had kind and patient doctors for myself. I would think that would be more so for a pediatrician.", "NTA is my official vote. I agree with others. You def need a new pediatrician. This one sounds a bit rude. \n\nI think it might be best to find a doc who may also be more open to holistic healing / organic methods but for you always remaining open that sometimes you might need more non holistic medicine sometimes.

The doctor literally rolled his eyes because OP used language that she knows from her training and job. \n\nThere are far, far, far too many products in the world for anyone person (doctor or otherwise) to have an exhaustive list of recommendations. There are always new things coming out, formulas changing. I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you the number of times a medical professional had passed on a recommendation - that they then told me another parent had introduced them to. Whenever I\u2019ve asked about a product they didn\u2019t mention they\u2019ve always been pleased - because they can check I\u2019m not using something I shouldn\u2019t.

It isn\u2019t just about having a good bedside manner - it\u2019s about being approachable and patient so that you can trust the doctor with your child\u2019s life. You are now second guessing yourself, asking for advice on how not to upset this paediatrician again. You\u2019re probably telling yourself off for \u201casking too many questions\u201d and openly contemplating not asking him for advice - in case it upsets him. \n\nIf the paediatrician thinks you\u2019re just being a nervous first time parent, rolling his eyes, belittling your professional knowledge and walking out on an appointment (where your daughter is the patient, not you) is a masterclass in feeding those nervous first time parent nerves. You are feeling terrible about being a concerned first time parent because your daughter\u2019s paediatrician belittled you about being a nervous first time parent. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d change doctors. Your child deserves a doctor who can at least be civil and professional. Walking out like he did is so beyond rude. You should be able to take your child to the doctor without worrying that they won\u2019t just walk out because you asked the \u201cwrong\u201d question. Good luck OP. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be defensive or anything, but I do want to clarify when I say I ask about things I google. I take doctor\u2019s visits pretty seriously, so I\u2019ll usually write a list of questions that I\u2019ve previously researched. I would never purposely cross-question him or disregard what he said. The exchange is usually something the lines of \u201cI noticed X, I read it could mean Y, what do you think/recommend/prefer?\u201d And he answers and we say ok. \n\nWith the lotion, he said J needed better overall lotion and gave the recommendations. I asked about the balm because wanted to clarify what exactly I should use on the dry spots and if that balm was okay. In my experience, it\u2019s best to show doctors what you\u2019re already using.

I did the same thing withy OB while pregnant, I would come to her with my questions and things I\u2019ve heard about or read about and ask her opinion.

Because definitely showing what you\u2019re using is good. But the order of you showing it and asking the questions on recommendations can change the perception of the situation. Just little things like that. \n\nSo it\u2019s probably a lot of being careful with word choice and tone! But yeah, clearly this doctor approached it wrong. I\u2019d find someone who understands where you\u2019re coming from and works with you on better understanding all your questions and cross references. I\u2019d say this bridge has been burned", "Well, for example, the lotion thing \u2026 he gave you recommendations of products he had vetted. \n\nDo you know how many lotion balms are in the market?
