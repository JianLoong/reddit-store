The day of, today, he decided that I shouldn\u2019t go because someone would take him and since they were moving, it would only be him going. I was confused because the amount they wanted in gas was equivalent to an Uber and there was no sign they would bring him home. Also, I wanted to go. \n\nOther times he told me I couldn\u2019t because his guy friends were coming, or I had to work, etc. \n\nBack to now. We\u2019re outside of Walmart and the Uber app is taking a minute to find a driver because it\u2019s a pretty long drive. He then says \u201cif I had done this my way, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. But then you would\u2019ve been upset\u201d so of course I asked how was this my fault. He then ofc tried to backtrack and got upset that I was upset and wouldn\u2019t \u201cfix my face\u201d so he told me to go home. \n\nWe live in a city where I don\u2019t have any family or friends, only him. I don\u2019t have a car and he had my drink, my charger, etc. When the Uber arrived I asked if I should get in. He got into the car, confirmed using my name, and closed the door. And they drove off. \n\nI immediately texted him I wanted a divorce and he responds telling me I should just go home. I couldn\u2019t book an Uber because he was using the ride I booked. I called him, crying in a Walmart parking lot. He said he didn\u2019t want to talk. \n\nSo I canceled his/MY ride while he was on the expressway and booked a ride back home.

I see some clear issues here \u2013 your banking situation seems quite odd, even people with bad credit can usually get bank accounts, especially at local banks. Your decisions seem out of line with how a typical adult would handle things. While it was nice of you to help with his job, you don't need to do it, and canceling his ride because you were upset might not have been the best choice. It affects the Uber driver and could lead to a difficult situation.\r  \n\r  \nDivorce should definitely be a last resort, especially if there are kids involved \u2013 although it doesn't seem like you have any. Since you're both young and don't seem to have your priorities sorted, my suggestion is to play it safe. Stop the physical contact so you don't confuse yourself, talk to a lawyer, start saving up money, and reach out to family for support. Get yourself prepared, then consider couples therapy. If that doesn't work, at least you'll have a way out.\r  \n\r  \nI think you both have some growing up to do.

He even told me , I don't want to look at your face, spat on my face in public and like a fool I kept giving my relationship more chances than needed. I was in a new country with the no friends or family except him. In my Indian culture, specially where I am from divorce is looked down upon and you need to compromise even if the marriage sucks. \n\nLong story short. I stretched that marriage for 5 years and finally got divorced. Had a lot of trauma that I finally managed to process in three years of therapy.\n\nLike you, in my first month of marriage I knew that was an awful relationship but I didn't follow my instincts and kept going because of the social stigma around divorce and also because of the fear of unknown and being all alone after divorce.\n\nI would suggest taking more time if you want to talk to him and discuss why he did what he did, why he acted like an AH. And he is willing, you guys need to work on this immature ways of handling conflicts. \n\nAnd you are NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
