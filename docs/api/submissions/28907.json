I live in a small town in Montana and my family has a few horses. School is 15 miles away so that's not walkable so my mom told us to just take the horses. I 16f have a brother 17m, 14m and a sister 11f. We have no other cars, my brother is going to buy one. We rode the horses to the middle and elementary and dropped off our siblings and we then rode to the high school. There's more space at the high school. Montana law states schools have to store your horses. \n\nWhen we got to school the principal told us we have to go home. We said no because we have no other way to get to school. He said he'd call the police on us so we told him to go ahead. After like an hour of back and forth bullshit they allowed us to keep the horses on some field. We tied them to a metal fence. He said don't do it again. \n\nWe went to school again by horse and the sheriffs department was actually called. Sheriff's department said they don't care and that we are allowed to do this. School said we can't enter. We went home after arguing. They called my mom and my mom got into a massive argument with them, I don't know what she did but she said something that scared them because now they allow us. Some people at school gave us nasty looks but a lot of people said we are legends. We got a lot of attention and at recess some people were playing with the horse, most of the school are people from cities not small towns. \n\nThe principal later told us in private that we are causing distractions and he expects us to find \"normal transport\" and that this needs to stop. We told him no, the law is on our side and that the horses aren't bothering anyone. \n\nFor questions, the horses have poop bags that collect all poop. We feed them before and after school, we bring water with it for it to drink during school.

Who is going to end up getting sued when your horse bites someone,  kicks someone and breaks their leg or tramples one of the idiot city kids messing around with them unsupervised?
