It was absolutely disgraceful for her to punch down on someone who made an honest mistake.\n\nNot to disrespect your wife in the slightest, but she isn't exactly helping here. What her daughter did? **That** was an overreaction, and it should've been corrected right then and there by her as the biological parent. \n\nI'm not saying that she's an irredeemable monster with anger issues, in fact, her reaction could have been genuine anger in the moment. She's a teenager, she likely spent a ton of time getting ready and looking her best only to have it ruined. She maybe felt annoyed to begin with having to go out with her step family. There are a ton of mitigating factors there... none of which of course justify what she did, but knowing how she feels could seek to understand why she lashed out the way she did.\n\nIf this isn't the first time she's done this, ***then*** it's a problem, and your wife enabled it by taking her side right after and giving her validation for acting out like that.", "If she can\u2019t behave well in a nice restaurant, then she shouldn\u2019t be there.

She berated him, disparaging his work and with profanity, in a restaurant where parents might have been with their children.\n\nShe sounds rather snobbish, like the wait staff are deserving of abuse, since they do low-paying menial jobs. Since she's dating age, the boys who come in contact with her might want to give her a wide berth. Isn't how your date treats the wait staff a tell-tale sign of how they'll treat you as a romantic partner?\n\nMoreover, you gave her more than enough chances to walk it back. She refused.

If your server is clearly indifferent or even rude, call them out calmly and assertively, ask to speak with management, and don't leave a tip. Publicly berating and demeaning them is extremely low-class behavior. Servers are human beings and human beings make mistakes. Trips and spills happen in restaurants. He apologized for it profusely. I've openly scolded dates for mouthing off to the waiter. You don't do that in front of me.\n\nThere are some teenagers who think they can do and say whatever they want. You need to put them in their place immediately and by whatever means necessary short of smacking them. If that takes making a scene and tossing them out of a restaurant, that's what it takes.\n\nYour wife is no better -- and clearly, seems to be enabling this kind of bratty, obnoxious behavior.

Sounds like your wife has some responsibility in creating or allowing this kind of behavior. What 16 year old thinks she can talk down to another adult as if that adult is somehow \"below\" her, all while making a dramatic scene, insulting the waiter, embarrassing her family, and acting like she's entitled to some kind of special princess treatment. She sounds awful and spoiled. Letting it go, even once, is telling her it's okay. She's 16. It's exactly the right time for her to learn that she absolutely cannot treat other people with disrepect if she wants to be respected herself. Screaming at a waiter for an ACCIDENT is out of line, and needed to be addressed, but the SECOND she launched into a tirade that mentioned his \"low pay\" as a way to talk down to him - an ADULT WITH A JOB (when she has no job and NO income) is some of the most entitled and obnoxious behavior I've ever heard about. You wre right, and your wife wasn't taking that seriously enough. This goes way beyond asking her to leave the restaurant. NTA for making her leave since she refused to apologize, but this requires a follow up discussion. What makes her think she is better than the waiter? Why does she think she can scream at an adult in a restaurant because she's unhappy? What did she expect the waiter to do when it was an accident? HOW DID IT GET TO THIS POINT where she thinks that this is acceptable? This type of behavior would terrify me - is this the kind of person you guys want to be raising? Good for you for not allowing it. If she's going to act like a toddler and have temper tantrums in a pubic place, she should be removed from the place, just like a toddler. If she wants to be treated like an adult, she needs to start acting like a reasonable and responsible adult by handling disappointing situations with more dignity. Act like a 5 year old - get treated like a 5 year old.", "NTA. She is 16 and had the supreme privilege, or disadvantage depending on how you look at it, of not having to work in customer service. Must be from money or at least from a comfortable enough financial situation that she has not even had to put herself in the waiter's shoes. Don't let her off the hook, and the wife should be ashamed.", "as a former waitress, NTA! and THANK YOU. far too many parents let their kids barade food service workers", "This!\nAnd this is why I encourage young people to get a job in the service industry. \nAt her age, my parents had a catering business so I would bring cups, plates, bowls to customers, often 100 plates a day.\n\nSometimes you drop a plate.\nSometimes you drop a bowl.\nSometimes a wine glass shatters.\nSometimes you spill something.\nSometimes it's on a customer. It's rare but it happens. \nI could tell you of a coffee refill incident, but you get the idea. \nYou are moving very fast with many items! \n\nAccidents happen as we are human. \nI am no longer in that industry, and my parents no longer own that business.\n\nBut even in the career I am now, I still make mistakes every so often.\n\nI have never been called a bastard.\nFunny thing, my parents were married when they had me.\nThis would have been a bigger insult for them and their culture. That type of insult, would have further have insulted my father's faith and morals. It would have been considered a very low thing to say. My dad might have wven tossed you out. It probably would have shocked me, but I probably would have not been insulted, but then, I was was here so a bit differently. \n\nWhy choose insulting words at all? And if you had to...\nIdiot would have been better. Moron too. But bastard? Yikes.  \n\nI'm not sure what culture the waiter was, but this word was chosen for a reason; it's  a very powerful and painful insulting attack. \n\nBut my adult son, I was not married to his father.

Wound up comping the meal and replacing the dress after the dry cleaning failed.", "NTA.

She had no right to speak to him that way. She showed who she is and how she views \"working people.\" That's quite an attitude for a 16 year old who doesn't work for the home she lives in or the food on her table. Does she have a job? Sounds like she could benefit from a job and doing some research about minimum wage, median wage and how hard it is to live on them (which a majority of people do).

Are both you and your wife equal when it comes to discipline and parenting styles? \n\nThe way I see it is that you are NTA in any sense for standing up for the server. If your stepdaughter does not learn to treat people with respect (especially in situations where she holds power over them) then she will turn into an adult who is not worthy of respect herself. Accidents happen and she needs to learn how to give grace in the same way she would want to revive it.\n\nHowever, if you do not have a relationship with her that is set up with you as an authority figure who she listens to, then your demands mean little if anything. If your wife (as her biological parent) has the disciplinary parenting role in your relationship dynamics then it was her responsibility to correct her behavior. It is worrying that she doesn't seem to agree that she was wrong enough for it to warrant an apology though.\n\nIt can also be said that having a full blown argument in the restaurant means ESH. You and/or your wife for not taking her outside for the discussion instead of the yelling match and of course her (much more so) for acting the way she did. \n\nYou and your wife need to get on the same page about the type of person you want to raise your stepdaughter to be and how to attempt and achieve that through parenting. It's probably a good idea to have her work in the service industry to help her gain perspective and hopefully more empathy. If you think it is a general anger problem then that is a separate issue that needs to be worked on as well.\n\nEdit- corrected the genders", "INFO - where the hell was the manager during all this?

Even when your daughter is wrong in one thing (being extremely rude) you still should support her, maybe some implicit way like going home the full family. \n\nAnd, finally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that IN EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT waiter can easily ruin someone\u2019s clothes and just apologise.

Kid sucks for her behavior, mom sucks for supporting it in any way and you suck for sending her out. IMO, apologize to waiter, ask for the check, and bounce immediately. Ground indefinitely.

She probably could have handled it with more grace, yes, but you should have given her some time to calm down and self regulate her emotions a bit before immediately demanding she apologize. You are also the asshole for unilaterally deciding on what her punishment was without taking a moment to cool down and speak with your wife about what the next steps would be. It sounds like you and step daughter both flew off the handle here, but you are supposed to be the parent/adult here. You could have easily apologized to the waiter yourself and then had a conversation with your daughter at home.

Waiter made a mistake food is definitely being comped. The waiter definitely feels terrible already as dropping anything on someone is something you fear as a waiter/runner doing so. To add the belittlement onto that, oh man. Waiter is definitely getting in trouble with boss and you daughter needed to know yes it\u2019s upsetting but treating people like that is not good she may grow up to put down people she believes are beneath her.

The kid is TA but being a 16 year old girl is a special kind of hell so I\u2019m hesitant to condemn her. But on my worst day I would never have acted like that.

You were definitely right especially since you tried the apology route first!", "NTA - what the hell is wrong with your wife?  She thinks it is okay for the waiter to have to continue to serve at a table that allowed this kid to berate him for an accident?  Also, the way she did it \"bastard\", \"paid low\", shouting.   Something is going on with this kid, I would look into her internet history, what kind of content is she consuming that makes her think it is okay to belittle people?  I would also restrict all access that she has to money.  If she wants money, let her get a job waiting on people or in customer service.

I wouldn\u2019t take the SD to a restaurant for a very long time.", "NTA - Your stepdaughter embarrassed and chastised another person for an honest mistake.

Make her get a job waiting tables, maybe as a summer job. Everyone should have to work a service industry job for a minimum of 12 months so that they will develop some fucking empathy.

The stepdaughter never allowed the waiter nor the manager to even offer before going ballistic.  \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, a ruined piece of clothing is not the end of the world, and while its ok to be upset, especially if you had plans after dinner, or would have to sit in maybe an uncomfortably damp item, this reaction was so disproportionate I'd never take her out again.", "Nah, this is not the ride or die you want.

She's quite old enough to decide that that's not an appropriate way to behave. Infantilizing her like you are and treating her like nothing she does is her fault is exactly what her mother probably did, because that's how you get kids like this.", "> do you not come to the conclusion that this is ultimately your wife\u2019s fault?

How about also phone all of his wife's high school teachers and influences in her life to tell them how they made Wife into a terrible parent to her daughter?  \n\nNo, you address the bad behavior that is occurring in the moment.  You address the person who is behaving poorly.  THEN you can have the conversation with the wife about where that behavior came from, what kind of behavior is acceptable or not, and what the plan should be going forward.  \n\nYou can't freeze time and address a lifetime's worth of butterfly effect sociological consequences in a moment.  \n\nDad did the right thing.
