As many of you read - I told my boss about what happened, was backed by my coworkers (unasked - people just don\u2019t like Matt) and Matt was asked not to come back to work. \n\nSome suggested sending a follow-up email to clarify it wasn\u2019t me who sent the original. I completely understand why that was mentioned - but my job is so unimportant I think that would just come off as irritating and unprofessional. \n\nFor clarity - our position is one with AmeriCorps - we are paid next to nothing and the organization we work for gets us for free. In order to be fired you have to be really fucking annoying. Matt was that today. Thank you again to each of you xoxo \n\n\n\nI (23F) work for a nationwide program in a small city as an intern. 23(M) \"Matt\" (not his real name) is my co-intern. Our roles are equal. While Matt is kind to me, he is also somewhat clueless about \"office etiquette\" of any kind. We are both in \"low\" roles (interns) within our department - we are there to help out and complete small tasks, we do not have subordinates, nor do we manage or head large tasks.\n\nIn the last 6 months, Matt has advised one company's CEO to \"finish up\" while he spoke during a meeting, has bossed other interns around, invited himself to lunch or private events that other employees discussed, asked inappropriate questions, taken incorrect initiatives and in general, is unpleasant and difficult to work with. \n\nWe were recently tasked with creating a small community event. Matt took on the role of emailing smaller vendors and nonprofits around our city, asking them for help with our event. Without telling me, Matt sent an email to 600 people in our city, some of them being key players/CEOs. The email was rude, asked for money (which we were **not** allowed to do), used improper grammar, contained incorrect information, and frankly, was embarrassing. It insinuated that nonprofits should dedicate their time to helping two lowly interns with a tiny project - it was an email I would NEVER send. At the end of the email - Matt signed BOTH of our names, first and last. \n\nThat means that 600 people, in a city where I would like to one day get a full-time job and begin my career, received an inappropriate email with my name attached. I was furious. Matt and I sit side by side in a cubicle, I asked him point blank how he could've done such a thing without running it past me. He told me he thought I would agree with the email, and that he had asked our boss. (I asked her - she had told him not to sign my name). I told him he had taken things too far, has no etiquette or manners, and that he has a negative reputation in our department and within the enter facility. Other interns heard our conversation and nodded in agreement. \n\nWas I wrong to raise my voice, say what I did, and humiliate him?   \"mean\" and that my comments were \"uncalled for\". I have tried to be patient, but our roles are so closely associated that I am genuinely afraid his behavior might lose me a career within this city. I honestly believe I have been nicer to Matt than I should be.\n\nWas I wrong to raise my voice, say what I did and humiliate him?

This is why I advise people to start their internships younger so when they enter the work force in their early twenties, they're ahead of the game. You didn't have that opportunity and that's OK, *you're learning now and so is Matt*. \n\nThe matter of him signing an email with your name.. I would have printed out the email and set up a conference with you, Matt and your supervisor or manager. It is management's job to correct such behavior and Matt isn't just hurting you but he's also hurting the company's image. That's something worth bringing up in a meeting. \n\nIf higher management is not correcting Matt, ask yourself why and try to observe the environment management is running. Do they not correct him because while Matt has poor etiquette, does he get results? Is management busy and considers matters between interns to be child's play? Or is management lazy or burnt out?\n\nConsider talking to the other interns that were in your favor. Ask them if they would be willing to talk to management about Matt's inappropriate verbiage and the way he sticks words in other people's mouths. Consider management's response and whether you'd like to work in such an environment based on their response and policies. \n\nBe stern, but not rude. Be assertive but cool. Mention the issues but don't be accusatory. And management loves if you suggest a solution. Maybe you and Matt could use mentors to learn the do's and dont's of corporate communications and office etiquette. \n\nTalk to management but don't be accusatory. Offer solutions and remain calm and flexible ***but don't take anyone's shit***. Lastly, above everything else, find some people you look up to and ask them if they'd be willing to be your mentors so they can offer advice on issues like these and so many others in the future!\n\nBest of luck.

In any case, you speaking out against it likely showed your coworkers that it's okay to be brave and speak up for yourself.", "Of course you weren\u2019t wrong.

Especially if it could cause issues for you o.my future job hunts.

I'm going with NTA because someone higher up the food chain should be in charge of supervising the interns and his behavior should have been discussed and corrected long before it reached this point.   \nIf he is repeatedly overstepping boundaries and showing up uninvited then someone (besides Matt) is really not doing his/her job.", "NTA.

Very much so.\n\nBut being upset doesn\u2019t mean you get to yell at people. \n\nYou are in a workplace, interacting with coworkers. You are expected to act appropriately *even when the other person messes up*.      \nWhen you don\u2019t, you make it very difficult for the workplace to properly identify and address the original problem, and you make the workplace uncomfortable for everyone else around you. More than that, you need to behave with the expectation that you will need to KEEP working in a positive fashion with the same people you were upset at. Unlike in a personal relationship, a workplace has expectations for how everyone will behave.\n\nAll if what that means is: when in a work setting, you must never react in anger. If you think you will, you disengage and leave the situation to calm down. When you fail to do this, it impacts not just the two of you now, but your work going forward and everyone around you. That\u2019s why you were also an AH - its bigger than just your \u2018friendship\u2019. I get why that isn\u2019t what you did this time; consider it a part of your learning as an intern, and do better with the next Mat 2.0 you end up dealing with down the line (hopefully not for a while though, knock of wood)\n\nWhatever Matt does, you make polite requests or, if you don\u2019t feel you can\u2019t because you\u2019re too upset or because you addressing it hasn\u2019t fixed the issue, you take it straight to your manager and ask THEM to address it.", "NTA - they should let him go but I assume he\u2019s related to someone who works there.", "NTA. I mean, you might have humiliated him, but he's not a child. He should know not to sign someone else's name.", "NTA. You are not wrong and he deserves all the consequences and all the shame. Everyone above him should have been actively managing him from day one. The CEO he told to finish up should have stopped talking and stared him down until he squirmed and then explained how inappropriate that was.  \n\nAlso, no one should ever sign your name to an email without your consent. I suggest asking your boss what she thinks you should do to troubleshoot this, since you're worried above negative impact to your own reputation. She might allow you to send out a reply all apologizing for dingus and rephrasing the ask in a professional manner.", "NTA\n\nTake \ud83d\udc4f that \ud83d\udc4f fool \ud83d\udc4f to \ud83d\udc4f H \ud83d\udc4f R \ud83d\udc4f", "no", "Nta bcc is the way to go", "YTA it\u2019s one thing to tell him it\u2019s not OK to sign your name to an email without your permission, it\u2019s wasn\u2019t OK for you to verbally vomit all your frustrations and embarrass him in front of other co-workers.
