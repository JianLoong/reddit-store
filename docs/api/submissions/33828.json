Otherwise it\u2019s a pittance for the injuries you describe and have to live with the results of. I assume your recovery is somewhat limited based on the laws of whatever country/jurisdiction this occurred in. You are under no obligation as far as I am concerned to compensate anyone who did not suffer physical injury due to an accident. This could have occurred at any time, the fact that it happened on holiday only turned it into a different kind of family adventure for your family. On the spectrum or not it\u2019s your money and it kind of feels from your description like your mom is trying to bully you. NTA.", "NTA.  There is not enuf to share for YOUR scars!", "NTA. \n\nDO NOT GIVE HER ANYTHING. Your life has been completely changed because of this and it\u2019s pretty insulting that your mum is trying to minimise the detriment caused to you by saying your sisters vacay was ruined. \n\nIn addition does anyone else feel like op mum has pocketed the money. Because for her to sue and you only get 2.8k is nuts.", "Are you in the USA?\nIf you are, that money was in lieu of the park being responsible for paying for your ongoing medical care. You should absolutely not be giving that money to your sister.\n\nIf you're not in the USA, you were injured and paid compensation of some sort, I guess. NTA,", "NTA. Tell your mom your sister did not suffer like you did. That money is yours, not hers. Your sister will be fine without it. So sad her holiday was ruined, but um hello?!!! You got it worse. Tell mom to stop guilt tripping and to lay off.", "Don\u2019t pay your mother no mind NTA", "NTA\n\n\u00a32.8 k is not a lot of money and it is not going to go far when you go to Uni.\n\nDo not give her the money you are going to need every penny", "WNBTA. You had a traumatic accident that scared your face. Your sister\u2019s holiday was ruined. They are not the same. It wasn\u2019t your fault that her holiday was ruined. If your mom wanted her to have money from the accident, she should\u2019ve sued the company on her behalf as well. \n\nIt\u2019s also not a lot of money. It\u2019s enough to get you set up for college, but giving away 1/3 of that money would seriously cut into your college funds. If it was like something totally outrageous like 100k, I could see giving her a portion as a nice gesture, but that\u2019s not what we are talking about. \n\nIt\u2019s only a couple grand and you are putting it to a good/responsible use. Mom should be proud you aren\u2019t blowing it on something silly like other 18yos.", "Nta if your sis had a legit grievance it would have been in the lawsuit and she would have had her own settlement", "NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Say, if you were a boy who intentionally jumped off of a roof and smashed his face in an amusement park, and then you sued the park because \"the fence was too short and it's your fault i even COULD jump over it\" - and this way you spoiled your sister's weekend - well, I'd give her all of your money, because you did something stupid as hell and (since you won the lawsuit) was not punished for it.  \nIF, say, you were sliding down a waterslide, and the park did not attach parts of the tube well (happened to me) and got scars because of that - and you sister was just sad for you and for the ruined holiday - I dont see why is she a victim here? So - no pay.  \n\n\nE.g. everything depends on the situation - and you lack any decent description of it. IF the park management are AH and you suffered because of it AND YOU SISTER DID NOT (get any harm) - then you are NTA.

Holidays get ruined for all sorts of reasons and worrying about an injured family member is generally the price people pay for having a family- it's just life. She doesn't deserve to get paid for it. The money is for you to compensate for pain and suffering, including suffering in the future. It's yours.", "NTA and \u00a32,800 is barely any money for a facial scar injury.

Tell your mother that you've got visible scars, and that your sister doesn't.   One child was disappointed because of missing a vacation; the other child was physically injured.  These are not the same.  I would point out that your sister wasn't awarded any damages at the time, so that tells you what the courts think.\n\nSave the money for university, and do *not* put it in an account your mother has access to.
