When I found out I was pregnant we were together for two years and he had proposed two months before. It was public, we both posted about it. At first he was excited but when I was seven months he broke up with me and moved out. I asked if he was going to be involved and he said no and blocked me everywhere.\n\n\nOur son is three now. Earlier this year he reached out to me saying hes matured and regrets not being in our sons life. I asked how hes matured and whats changed in the three years hes been no contact and he said that he has a new lifestyle and this and that. Come to find out hes married to a hardcore hippie vegan and living a completely different life. He lives on a farm now and has a lot of animals, none he makes profit off of. I was beyond shocked. He also doesnt smoke or drink and is just so\u2026 different. I spoke to my boyfriend, friends, and parents and they said to give him a chance.\n\n\nHe offered to start paying for his daycare and has been since May. I allowed him to meet my son in a supervised setting at the farm (I wanted to see the horses and animals lol) and met his wife. She inherited the farm and completely redesigned it. She was teaching me and my sisters about her raw organic vegan lifestyle and fed us a potato stew she made. It was really good and I thought things went well. They seemed trustable.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve done a few more supervised visits throughout the year and I only now feel comfortable letting him stay overnights alone. They feed him vegan and I dont mind. The issue is they sat me down recently and asked that I start feeding him vegan full time since its much better for him and the world and that since he wants more involvement it makes sense he has a plantbased lifestyle. I said no, I myself am not vegan and they are not even the vegan chicken nuggets from Walmart type, they are the strictly raw fruits and vegetables type and thats asking me to learn a whole other type of cooking. They offered to meal prep during my time. He said in 2024 he wants 50/50 custody but that if I be \u201cdifficult\u201d he will go for full custody siting our age and income difference and that I still live with my parents. I told him by threatening me he can see me in court and left. \n\n\nOne of my sisters that came with me to a few of the visits has been vegetarian for many years now and she says Im being unreasonable since its healthier for him and they even offered to cook all his meals. And that by eating vegan for a while, it will mess up his digestive system if he eats meat and to just choose one and that since its a lifestyle for them and he will be involved in it, to just agree or Im the asshole?

When your son is in your care it\u2019s up to you what you feed him but you could also get professional advice on the nutritional needs for a 3 year old.", "NTA. and while your sister is right that it can be hard for a non meat eater to process meat, he\u2019ll only be gone for a week at a time. \n\nSorry dad, you can\u2019t vanish for three years and then come back and expect full custody because of your own dietary choices. \n\nIt sounds like the wife understands nutrition, but vegan diets can be very difficult to get all of the protein and nutrients one needs and kids can be trouble enough getting them to eat right!! Especially when it\u2019s not even OPs life style!", "NTA ! So your husband can date a 17 yr old , break a marriage proposal, and leave his child behind for 3 years. But you would be the criminal for feeding your son meat?", "NTA.\n\nGet a lawyer, get your custody worked out (including child support, retroactively), and feed that child as you see fit. Your ex has just replaced one way of being an asshole with another.", "This vegan stuff might be just a diversion to make you weak and to distract you from them trying to steal your child. \n\nYour ex is now paying for daycare, to create a paper-trail that he is taking care of your son. He will start to do more to gain control, make OP look incompetent and to be able to show on paper that he has rights to your son. Don't get tempted by the money, see it more as a weapon that can be used against you.\n\nCheck the laws in your state and even consider quietly moving away to a state with better laws and more protection for you and your son.", "You said that your child's father walked out of your life and blocked you when you were seven months pregnant.  Is he even legal dad at this point?  Because if not he can pound sand, he has zero say in your son's life until he goes to court and files for paternity and visitation.\n\nAfter three years absent a court won't give 50-50 or full custody.  Visitation would be supervised initially.  You can find out what type of visitation schedule is typical in your state, in mine it's recently been changed to 50-50 as the standard though obviously that doesn't work in all cases.", "NTA.  And this isn't about vegan, it's about him trying to exert control over you and your son.  As soon as he threatened to go for full custody, you were 100% right to cut him off.", "It's a matter of opinion whether a vegan diet is healthier for a three-year-old. An opinion I don't share. Furthermore, it's totally unreasonable for a father who's been out of his son's life to sweep in and demand you change your son's diet. I'm not sure what he thinks the age difference will mean in terms of gaining custody, but I would think the fact that you've been the only parent for most of your son's life will weigh much more heavily with the court.", "NTA. Kind of jaw dropping that he has the gall to come back and pull that. And never let him have 50/50 custody. Courts won\u2019t give him full custody unless you are bringing your kid to drug deals or putting the child in imminent danger.", "NTA - a raw vegan diet is absolutely NOT suitable for a small child, and I\u2019m saying that as a someone who has been raising a \u201cvegan\u201d child for 10 years, who also has a qualification in child nutrition. It is HARD. My daughter is allergic to eggs and dairy and we don\u2019t eat meat so we had to be under the care of a dietitian when she was very small, until they were satisfied that I knew what I was doing. I would be very interested to see what they are feeding him as you just cannot get every thing you need from raw fruit and vegetables. Ask them what they feed him when he\u2019s there, under the pretence of learning how to feed him a vegan diet, and get it reviewed by a health professional. I honestly think they\u2019re putting his health at risk. Also, it will make your life 10 times harder - birthday parties, school dinners and trips, holidays - will all get really difficult and he\u2019ll be that raw vegan kid that no-one wants to invite to their birthday party. He is unlikely to want to do it anyway. If you ask him if he wants to give up chocolate and cupcakes for carrots and kale , what do you think he\u2019d say? Also - it\u2019s just not their decision!", "\u201cHe said in 2024 he wants 50/50 custody but that if I be \u201cdifficult\u201d he will go for full custody.\u201d\n\nHe was absent for the first three years of his son\u2019s life and now wants to change something fundamental in his life but thinks he\u2019ll get 50/50 custody. BAHAHAHAHA.\n\nNTA. Do not let this threat scare you. It\u2019s as empty as they come.\n\nBut it\u2019s still a threat. Write down exactly what he said while it\u2019s fresh in your mind. Keep a record of how it\u2019s all gone since he reappeared. Talk to your lawyer.\n\nAnd go back to supervised visits only.", "NTA. I would lawyer up if I were you. He'll probably try for custody.", "NTA - I myself am a vegan and think it would be great for you to try it out BUT\u2026 he comes traipsing back after three years as a deadbeat dad and starts laying down the law?!?! Even if he is eager for you to come around to his way of thinking, does he really think bullying is the way to do it? Get a good divorce attorney and do NOT let him make threats like that.\np.s. Your lousy sister is TA too for debating the health values of veganism rather than your ex thinking he can dictate how you raise your kid.", "NTA! You were 17 and 22 when you started dating? He then walked out on you at 19 years old, 7 months pregnant, and left you alone to raise your child for 3 years and now he threatens to get full custody because you won\u2019t feed your child a diet that does NOT give a growing toddler all the vitamins it needs?!? Stop any visitation, do not let him keep paying daycare, and get a lawyer!", "Vegan is a choice - one that he's not old enough to make himself. He would grow up being more likely to potentially develop sensitivities/intolerances/allergies to foods if hes deprived of it at such a young age. \n\nYou can eat organic and not be vegan (Im gluten free (not by choice) and I eat organic, but I still get to enjoy foods i grew up enjoying) There are so many ways to eat healthy without having to be vegan and rule out everything. \n\nI personally just think it'd be a bit cruel and I'd refuse just like you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. And he obviously has no knowledge about family court. His threats are meaningless. The fact that you live with your parents is a huge *plus* in family court. It means you have a support system. \n\nAs for food, unless a medical doctor is saying your child is malnourished or a medical doctor is saying your son has a condition that requires a dietary change to treat, the court will not give a crap about one parent wanting to be vegan and one not. They will say each parent is allowed to feed the child whatever they want during their own parenting time.", "NTA. You raised your child without him and now he pops back in to your lives and expects you to change your life for him. Then he threatens you for not giving in to his demands. Make sure you save any messages, texts, or emails from him or his group and get a good attorney. Hopefully you'll legally establish sole custody. He'll probably get bored/pissed off and f*ck off back to where he came from.", "NTA.  He\u2019s barely a part of your son\u2019s life and now thinks he can demand you change everything after parenting alone for 3 years?  And he is going to make it hard for you in court because income differences?  Wonder what he will think when you respond by going after him for 3 years of non-support?", "NTA. The human body requires a type of vitamin (B12) that is only found in animal meat. Your son's body is still rapidly growing needing everything it's taking in so that he'll grow healthy and strong. We are, as a human species, obligatory omnivorous. Adults who have finished FULLY DEVELOPING can be vegan if they wish, but it's wrong to push that upon a growing child. Infants have been taken away by social workers for malnourishment because of vegan parents pushing it on them. They can think you're the ass all they want, but you're keeping your child healthy.", "He already made his choice when he told you the first time that he wanted nothing to do with his own son. You've been very kind in letting him change his answer because for me, there would be absolutely no taking that back whatsoever and he could leap headfirst down a manhole. That said  YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER TO MAKE HIM BE A VEGAN. In  fact I'm just going to be extraordinarily candid and say that it's a terrible idea for a three year old. He could end up with all sorts of developmental problems from severe malnutrition. Feed him a normal diet that includes meat and dairy and such, then let him decide to become vegan as an adult if he wants to.", "Raw potatoes are poisonous, please don\u2019t eat potatoes raw and definitely don\u2019t give them/don\u2019t let anyone else give them to a child!", "NTA. Dad is going to have a very hard time getting full custody after abandoning baby for 3 years!! I wouldn't allow any more visits without a court order.", "A \"raw organic vegan lifestyle\" wouldn't include potato stew.", "I can\u2019t imagine trying to g to feed a kid a *raw* vegan diet. They clearly have never spent time with 3 year olds. They are out of their minds. \n\nNTA", "NTA, and now that he has threatened legal action, tell your ex that all contact with you can go through your lawyer.\n\nI\u2019m guessing what happened is he got married and his wife wants a kid, and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh hey, I just happen to have one lying around\u2026\u201d  Now the wife wants to start making parenting decisions.", "You will be sorry if your kid gets attached to him.  Make him go to court for visitation after he pays back support . Also. A child's brain may need more than vegan get informed.  Keep him away as longs as u can. Ot married. Make him get a paternity test. Make it hard for him he wants to steal your kid.  Keep silent and plan. I went through this 30 years ago. Its scary but u can do it", "NTA.\n\nIf he takes you to court go for full custody citing that they\u2019ll put the child in danger by feeding him only vegan food. Meat is needed for a healthy development. Sorry to say but your sister is also an idiot for butting in on the issue and considering she\u2019s also a vegan it\u2019s not surprising that she\u2019s on their side.\n\nIf you can you can also get a nutritionist opinion to present in court, if he does indeed take you to court. I doubt any nutritionist will approve a vegan based diet for a growing kid.\n\nNow i\u2019m not a lawyer but I don\u2019t know if a court would afford him full custody considering he split for 3 years with NC and leaving you raising your kid by yourself. He can play the change card all he wants but since he has a history of abandoning you and your child it means that it could happen again.\nIt might even backfire and make him pay child support.", "NTA. He has no right coming back into your & your son\u2019s life and then demanding that you switch him to a diet that isn\u2019t even necessarily healthy for a young child.", "NTA\n\nYou're the primary caretaker. Your ex can see you in court.", "NTA this isn't about veganism, this isn't about your son's overall wellbeing, this is about control and threats.", "Since he decided to threaten you, I\u2019d check into statutory rape laws in your state.  You were a child, he was an adult.  File charges if you can.  Kinda hard to get custody when you\u2019re in prison.\n\nBut if 17 was legal, it\u2019s time to halt all visits, get a lawyer and make him deal in court.  Document all threats and demands from his family to show you\u2019re under constant harassment.  It won\u2019t look good that a grown man manipulated and impregnated a child, abandoned her, and years later is now threatening and sending people to harass her.", "NTA People have died from that diet, even recently. Literally have dropped dead from malnutrition. A kid so very young needs a ton of food for the energy they are expending to grow and develop. A raw vegan diet doesn't have the nutrition a child needs, it doesn't even have what an adult needs! Only humans think they are some how above nature and are vegan. No other mammal in the world is. (Including bugs in the list of foods for non vegan)", "NTA. They are welcome to feed your son vegan meals while he\u2019s at their house, but they can\u2019t control what you feed him at your house.\n\nJust doing the math here \u2014 so you got pregnant when you were 19 and he was 24, and you were together for two years so you got together at 17 and 22. Make sure you inform your lawyer about that when you start working on an official custody plan. I\u2019m sure a judge would love to hear his age-based maturity argument based on the age you were when he started dating you.", "NTA. I am sorry you are having to deal with this and that your sister wasn't supporting you. Family courts don't care about your income or age. If you lived in a box, they would still give you custody because they only care about children being with their parents. Not how big their house is, or room is or how much money one parent makes over the other. It's pretty crazy how these self righteous assholes think they know what judges care about. You can even get a mediator or handle it yourself and the judge would still not give custody based on income or age. This asshole didn't care to be involved until he met this tree hugger who set him straight? You can feed him whatever you want. You got this!", "NTA.  He doesn't get to dictate anything after what he pulled.  Especially not to please his partner.  I hope you've got the messages where he threatened you because he's definitely the asshole.", "Im willin to bet my left ovary that theyre the deeply unhealthy vegans cause they dont get a lot of important nutrients. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso OP, NEVER LET THEM HAVE A SAY ON VACCINES. JUST GET THE KID ALL HIS VACCINES AND NEVER SAY A WORD TO THEM ABOUT IT", "Of course not. Why would you be an asshole for wanting the best nutrition for your kid?!\nGo animal products!

I am glad he wants to be involved in his son\u2019s life now, but he also dipped and abandoned him for the first three years. He can eat vegan there and eat how you eat when he is with you. It won\u2019t mess up his stomach lol That is absurd - I\u2019m also a vegetarian and your sister is flat out wrong. How does that even make sense? If he eats no meat for a few days he will be sick to eat it again three days later? Lol ridiculous! \n\nDocument everything in case you need it in court. Try not to stoop to his level in communications with him - purely bc he could try to use it against you. Consult with a family law attorney if you can. A court is not going to remove a child from his mother because you won\u2019t feed him a raw vegan diet or because you don\u2019t live on a farm. But you\u2019ll feel better and be better prepared hearing that from an attorney.", "NTA, lol the sister saying that, eating a diverse, whole real foods diet is very good for you, lets not compare. Also, did he give money for the first 3 years he was gone? I'm sure in court they would keep that in mind, in any case see a family lawyer and dont take legal help from reddit", "NTA   I hope he paid you for the 3 years he didn't pay child support.  And you sound like an emtremely kind and generous person.    And btw it won't affect his health to have a few vegan meals and then go back to your regular diet with you.  He's making up crap   that he thinks will work on you.", "NTA. Also he's now threatened to take your child, you need to consukt family lawyer immediately to prepare for whatever he might throw at you, and also start documenting all of this. It can be as simple as a notebook where you write down what happened more or less right after it happened, keeping the record simple and factual.", "First of all, NTA - you were kind enough to introduce this STRANGER into your sons life. After he just disappeared when you needed him the most? Now he's chasing after your son, brainwashing him into going vegan, sneakily trying to get more paper proof that he can support him more than you do until you can't get full custody. Look at the patterns, see how he is slowly getting your trust and your sons trust so that there won't be any problems in the future when he takes him away from you. U might think im exaggerating but being a mum means u have to protect your child from these type of people even if they contributed in creating the child. U gotta trust your instincts on this mum.", "Nta", "NTA.  He is.  Big time.  He's lucky you are even letting him do supervised visits.

Which if not done correctly can be harmful. Also, when does he start saying medicine is bad? Is he re-establishing contact because he and his gf cannot have children together? \n\nGo to court.

When I found out I was pregnant we were together for two years and he had proposed two months before. It was public, we both posted about it. At first he was excited but when I was seven months he broke up with me and moved out. I asked if he was going to be involved and he said no and blocked me everywhere.\n\n\nOur son is three now. Earlier this year he reached out to me saying hes matured and regrets not being in our sons life. I asked how hes matured and whats changed in the three years hes been no contact and he said that he has a new lifestyle and this and that. Come to find out hes married to a hardcore hippie vegan and living a completely different life. He lives on a farm now and has a lot of animals, none he makes profit off of. I was beyond shocked. He also doesnt smoke or drink and is just so\u2026 different. I spoke to my boyfriend, friends, and parents and they said to give him a chance.\n\n\nHe offered to start paying for his daycare and has been since May. I allowed him to meet my son in a supervised setting at the farm (I wanted to see the horses and animals lol) and met his wife. She inherited the farm and completely redesigned it. She was teaching me and my sisters about her raw organic vegan lifestyle and fed us a potato stew she made. It was really good and I thought things went well. They seemed trustable.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve done a few more supervised visits throughout the year and I only now feel comfortable letting him stay overnights alone. They feed him vegan and I dont mind. The issue is they sat me down recently and asked that I start feeding him vegan full time since its much better for him and the world and that since he wants more involvement it makes sense he has a plantbased lifestyle. I said no, I myself am not vegan and they are not even the vegan chicken nuggets from Walmart type, they are the strictly raw fruits and vegetables type and thats asking me to learn a whole other type of cooking. They offered to meal prep during my time. He said in 2024 he wants 50/50 custody but that if I be \u201cdifficult\u201d he will go for full custody siting our age and income difference and that I still live with my parents. I told him by threatening me he can see me in court and left. \n\n\nOne of my sisters that came with me to a few of the visits has been vegetarian for many years now and she says Im being unreasonable since its healthier for him and they even offered to cook all his meals. And that by eating vegan for a while, it will mess up his digestive system if he eats meat and to just choose one and that since its a lifestyle for them and he will be involved in it, to just agree or Im the asshole?
