I took it pretty hard. I got a book about it, and it confirmed a fear I had that I would never be normal or have friends I actually liked. I got depressed for a bit. Then after a few weeks of feeling like garbage, I decided I would not do that stuff anymore. I researched it a lot and started working hard to overcome my issues. I exposed myself to the stuff that bothered me on purpose until it was more bearable and I could handle it without meltdowns. I worked hard to learn social skills from the ground up too. I asked for acting classes and applied what I learned there to my voice and facial expressions and body movements. I read as many books as I could about how to be a good friend or romantic partner and a lot of mens' magazines. It worked, and by the time I was in high school, I had friends I liked and could act like a neurotypical completely. An added benefit was that my endurance was crazy high. I don't really let discomfort bother me, which let me work out a lot more than most kids my age were willing to. I ended up with an athletic scholarship and married my college girlfriend (25F). I think what I did worked great. The problem is that my youngest brother in law (16M) has autism and acts out because of it. He has loud meltdowns regularly at 16. His parents have been focused on him for a long time because of this. My wife feels left behind by her family. I recently mentioned that I had autism during an argument about whether mother-in-law could make it to my wife's MFA graduation or not. She said mine was probably not very bad. I said yes it was. It was very bad until I made it stop. My parents did not think I would ever live independently. I made it stop. I told her how and now everyone is angry at me.

I have trouble finding any that seem to give a path to a good life at all.", "This makes no sense. If you do not show negative consequences, there is no motivation.", "And? Are you hearing the people who say that *do* and they're still depressed?", "I beg to differ. Everyone needs help in some way or another. And your comments are very telling. \n\nI was referring to you saying it is unhealthy to need a caretaker, anyway.", "You aren\u2019t everyone, and not everyone is like you. Get over yourself.", "Because you felt not good enough because of that stupid book. Because you put yourself through horrible things just to seem \"normal\". \n\nAnd now you feel infinitely superior to people who don't do what you did.", "Because BIL is not you. He didn't live your life and isn't living it now.", "Exactly. Should autistic people be ashamed?", "Absolutely not true for autistic people. \n\nPositive reinforcement is a more powerful motivator for NTs than negative repercussions. \n\nThe idea that you can punish a child out of being autistic is abusive. \n\nYou chose to do things for yourself, you were self motivated. If your parents did that to you it would have been abuse.", "If I had not done those things I would be living with my parents and not have my wife or friends or a real life or access to the real world. How is that better for me?", "You have no way of knowing that. Did you even do any kind of therapy as a kid? I am an OT that works with kids with autism, our goal is to help people be as independent as possible. For some people that will be a lot. For others much less. But we work with the actual person. Not trying to change them or make them seem NT.\n\nABA can go to hell as far as I am concerned.", "I did not experience ABA. I was self-motivated in all of this. My parents gave up on me having a normal life. I did not."]}
