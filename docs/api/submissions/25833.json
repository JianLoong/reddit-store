My dad tends to be openly judgmental about basically anything, and I was worried from the beginning about how things would go. Ever since I was a kid he's been critical of my mom for gaining weight after having kids, and he frequently makes shitty comments to her about it (\"are you sure you want to eat all that?\" \"wouldn't you rather have a salad?\" and stuff like that. It's infuriating to witness) so I was worried that he might say something about my girlfriend's weight. Her weight has fluctuated over her life, and right now she's a bit heavier. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously I'm attracted to her regardless of body size, but I know she can be self-conscious about it. I never mentioned anything to my parents before about her size because honestly it doesn't matter and isn't relevant to anything, but maybe I should have talked to my dad beforehand to ask him to behave. But instead I assumed he could act like an adult for one evening.  \n\n\nAnyway, we planned to meet up outside the restaurant and go in together. We got there early, and when my parents arrived my dad looked at her with a noticeably shocked expression. All of my previous girlfriends have been smaller, so I think he had a different expectation of what she would look like. We got a table, and things were going alright until it was time to order. When my girlfriend went to order some pasta, my dad said \"are you sure you don't want to try one of the salads?\" and I flipped out. I told him that mom might put up with him saying this kind of bullshit to her all the time, but I wasn't going to let him be passive aggressive to my girlfriend. I stood up and asked her if she wanted to go somewhere else, and she looked like she felt really awkward but got up with me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom also looked super embarrassed and didn't say anything, and my dad told me to calm down and not to take things so seriously. I told my mom that I was sorry, but that we'd have to get dinner together some other time without my dad, and I left with my girlfriend. We had a moderately awkward dinner just by ourselves at a different restaurant nearby.  \n\n\nMy mom texted me afterwards saying that she was really looking forward to meeting my girlfriend and that she was disappointed that we left before even having a conversation with her. My girlfriend knew that my dad is kind of a dick, because I've told her about what he's like before, but she said that she would have been willing to tolerate it to meet my mom, who is a kind person. Now I'm feeling like maybe I overreacted over something small when even my girlfriend said that she would still have stayed, and causing a scene upset my mom. But at the same time I don't want to establish a precedent where my dad feels like he can talk to my girlfriend like that.

You responded admirably in shutting down that nonsense immediately and definitively.\n\nYou might consider having a conversation with your Dad about what happened. He has now received a very definitive message about what you will not tolerate. If he's willing apologize and accept the boundary, you might try a \"do over\" dinner, if your girlfriend is willing.", "NTA. You\u2019re an amazing bf and son. \nWhen you grow up with family members acting a certain way, it\u2019s really easy to just assume that\u2019s normal and how everyone\u2019s parent acts. So good for you for recognizing the toxicity and standing up for what is right! \nI would definitely follow through with inviting just your mom out for dinner with your gf. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to have some time away from your shitty dad!", "NTA. You are a wonderful guy that has your partner's back. That is awesome, especially when it comes to a weight \"issue\". Your father sounds lovely, I'm sure he's a 10 in looks then (Please read that with a scoff and dripping in sarcasm). \n\nI don't think you overreacted. I think you just snapped harder because of past situations when he's treated your mother horribly. I can understand your partner's embarrassment and awkwardness too though. Meeting the parents is a big deal. I hope you get a dinner with her and your mom. \n\nIf you think it will help, try to have a calm discussion with your father about his behavior and how it has affected you. If you don't think an in person conversation would work, maybe write him an email or long text? Give him an awakening and see how he reacts. At least to say you tried.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re establishing boundaries with your dad. You\u2019re making it absolutely clear that you will not put up with his judgemental bullshit. \n\nContinue to enforce this. Talk to your mom and make plans with just her, and let her and your dad know that the second your dad starts to act like a sexist asshole that you will be leaving. He can either do the bare basics of being a respectful adult or he can have no relationship with his child.", "Nta, I would explain to your mom that you wont excuse your dad shitty behavior towards your gf. She may be willing to put with it but not you. That if your dad makes a commitment like that again then you will continue to leave.", "Did you overreacted? Yes\n\nDid you put you girlfriend in an awkward position to either said that your dad comment was alright (which is not) or following you out. Yep you did. \n\nTime to speak to your dad is overdue. You need to clearly express to him how disgusting for other is him body shaming your mother. Specially that you won\u2019t tolerate him doing it to your SO.", "NTA Hopefully both your parents will get a clue. To your dad, that those \"little\" comments aren't so little. And to your mom that she doesn't have to put up with that BS. \n\nEither way, thank you for standing up for your GF. It might have been awkward at the time, but it could well save her from years of sniping.", "ESH. Not your mother or you GF.\n\nYour dad obviously is an AH. Your poor mother!\n\nBut you suck for overreacting and not giving you GF a chance to stand up for herself, and to get to know your sweet mother. And who knows, maybe your GF could have made your dad change his ways? Maybe? With the help of you?\n\nOf course I understand WHY you overreacted, but you overreacted non the less. You were a balloon ready to pop, and you sure popped :-)", "Imagine meeting someone, your child\u2019s significant other nevertheless, for the first time, and almost the first thing out of your mouth is a comment on their food choices with an side order of implication that they are overweight?! Talk about showing someone who you are at the first meeting\u2026 I think OP is right in that dear old dad has gotten very comfortable to being passive aggressive and causally cruel to his wife, and that this now extends to other women as well. He didn\u2019t even bother to hide his \u201cchock\u201d at GFs appearance at first glance, because it\u2019s his right to shame women for their bodies. /s \n\nGood on OP for sending a clear message that this is a boundary. Meet up with mom, and tell her again that you won\u2019t tolerate his cruelty, but that you and GF can hang with her whenever she wants. NTA", "Easy NTA. I would have carried dad out. Dragged from ear or something.", "Nta. Your dad knows exactly what he's doing.  Good for you for not tolerating it on behald of your girlfriend. Take your mom and girlfriend on a coffee and cake date so they can get to know eachother."]}
