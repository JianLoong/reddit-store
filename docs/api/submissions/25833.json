You responded admirably in shutting down that nonsense immediately and definitively.\n\nYou might consider having a conversation with your Dad about what happened.

You\u2019re an amazing bf and son. \nWhen you grow up with family members acting a certain way, it\u2019s really easy to just assume that\u2019s normal and how everyone\u2019s parent acts.

That is awesome, especially when it comes to a weight \"issue\". Your father sounds lovely, I'm sure he's a 10 in looks then (Please read that with a scoff and dripping in sarcasm). \n\nI don't think you overreacted. I think you just snapped harder because of past situations when he's treated your mother horribly. I can understand your partner's embarrassment and awkwardness too though. Meeting the parents is a big deal. I hope you get a dinner with her and your mom. \n\nIf you think it will help, try to have a calm discussion with your father about his behavior and how it has affected you. If you don't think an in person conversation would work, maybe write him an email or long text? Give him an awakening and see how he reacts. At least to say you tried.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re establishing boundaries with your dad. You\u2019re making it absolutely clear that you will not put up with his judgemental bullshit. \n\nContinue to enforce this. Talk to your mom and make plans with just her, and let her and your dad know that the second your dad starts to act like a sexist asshole that you will be leaving. He can either do the bare basics of being a respectful adult or he can have no relationship with his child.", "Nta, I would explain to your mom that you wont excuse your dad shitty behavior towards your gf.

Yes\n\nDid you put you girlfriend in an awkward position to either said that your dad comment was alright (which is not) or following you out. Yep you did. \n\nTime to speak to your dad is overdue. You need to clearly express to him how disgusting for other is him body shaming your mother.

It might have been awkward at the time, but it could well save her from years of sniping.", "ESH. Not your mother or you GF.\n\nYour dad obviously is an AH. Your poor mother!\n\nBut you suck for overreacting and not giving you GF a chance to stand up for herself, and to get to know your sweet mother. And who knows, maybe your GF could have made your dad change his ways? Maybe? With the help of you?\n\nOf course I understand WHY you overreacted, but you overreacted non the less.

Talk about showing someone who you are at the first meeting\u2026 I think OP is right in that dear old dad has gotten very comfortable to being passive aggressive and causally cruel to his wife, and that this now extends to other women as well. He didn\u2019t even bother to hide his \u201cchock\u201d at GFs appearance at first glance, because it\u2019s his right to shame women for their bodies. /s \n\nGood on OP for sending a clear message that this is a boundary.

You just laid down a SOLID BOUNDARY! \n\nNow we get to the FAFO part of the program and see if dad plays ball or wants to discover consequences!", "NTA\n\nYou did exactly the right thing. You have now set a clear boundary right from the start, and you father knows that his rude bullshit is unacceptable because you did not accept it. Well done.", "NTA\nYour gf sould have stayed because women are trained from a very young age to accept people discussing our bodies in a derogatory way and to pretend that that's ok,  especially if it's an older man or authority figure.  Your one mistake here was asking your gf if she wanted to leave because then you made her responsible for leaving and not you.  Your dad is a major asshole and your mother is just worn down by his shitty behavior.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThat being said I think I might have taken the route of taking my father aside and saying what I had to say rather than potentially embarrassing my partner and mother.

But well, i think it is good you stood up. \nAlso, it sounds like your relationship with your dad is really strained anyway.", "NTA.  Actions have consequences, and your old man knew exactly what he was doing.  If he wants to see more of you, he needs to clean up his act.", "Info- is this the first time that anyone ever said something back to your father?", "NTA and there is zero reason to put up with comments like that just because 'that's how dad is'.

Bet he cannot take criticism either.", "NTA", "NTA but be prepared for people not to recognize that. When someone is shitty the way that your dad is, often it\u2019s easier to blame you for \u2018rocking the boat\u2019 and \u2018making things unpleasant\u2019 than it is to blame him for being a jerk.", "NTA. it's time he hears about it.

So maybe.", "Sure, mom is at fault for not standing up to her husband herself, but that was not the question he posed.", "Had to look that up. Looks tasty, and I might have to try making it!", "NTA, your girlfriend \"would\" have stayed, but the point is she shouldn't have to. Good job protecting her peace and getting her away from that. It shouldn't be too hard for your dad to keep his mouth shut and have basic respect for a dinner to meet your girlfriend, and since it clearly is difficult, you removed yourself and your girlfriend. \n\nI'm mortified how vocal he is about that, can you imagine how he'd be if you had kids?", "NTA Shut it down at the beginning.", "NTA As women we are told from childhood to keep the peace. Whether it is verbally told to us are just put upon us unknowingly as kids. Teachers tend to use girls as examples for the boys to behave or they put the \u201cnice girl\u201d with the trouble make boys hoping she will be a good example etc. This happens our whole lives and it\u2019s hard to stray from if it doesn\u2019t come automatically to you.

So many in-law AITA posts on this sub stem from situations like this, where someone has let their parent/friend/sibling treat their significant other like shit for so long that it turns into an unwinnable situation for everyone. You stepped in immediately and made it very clear that you won't tolerate your father mistreating your girlfriend based on his superficial standards.

I get your girlfriend would have made nice but it was shitty of your dad to say it and clearly it was a bridge too far for you. This was not about your girlfriend (although kudos for taking a stance that protected her but I get that she might find the assumption that she needed it irritating). This seems to be more about the fact that you snapped when your father disappointed you yet again by failing to keep a handle on himself and was rude yet again to someone you love. You and your dad have a reckoning coming. Stand strong, friend. He is a bully (and probably misogynistic). Sorry", "You set the tone of his relationship with your gf right off the bat. You wont allow him to be a dick so NTA", "NTA.  You set a firm boundary with your AH dad (and sorry to say he really is an AH).  Your mom might let it slide and your girlfriend was willing to let is slide in order to meet your mother.  But you did exactly the right thing.  You stood up for her and told him exactly why.  He can choose to reflect on that or not change and loose having you and potential DIL in his life.  Because if it were me, we'd never see him again until he got help and changed his attitude.

I understand that you and your gf could have tolerated your father's behavior, but I think it's best to set the boundary that none of his nonsense will be tolerated.

Don\u2019t need to call Scooby & Shaggy to find the AH here.  You did the right thing.  I have a few toxic relatives that I avoid at all costs.  Let your dad know it won\u2019t be tolerated now or with any person you\u2019re with in the future.", "NTA. You did not overreact. You did the right thing. People like your father never change because nobody challenges them. Can't rock the boat. So he just cruises along thinking he is entitled to that behavior. You made it clear that you won't listen to his nonsense. Well done.", "NTA\n\nYou've put your father on notice that you won't tolerate his bullshitty, misogynistic behavior.  Well-done you!  And although she may have said she'd be willing to tolerate his behavior this one time so she could meet your Mum, I'm thinking your GF was probably grateful that you stood up for her.", "NTA. Whenever people \"tolerate\" his behaviour, it shows he can keep on getting away with it.", "Nope, NTA. You set a boundary in a big way. Good for you for standing up for your GF and mom. that\u2019s not easy to do", "I'm so proud of you OP.  I have been married a long time.  It took my husband 15 years to stand up for me.  Thanks.  NTA", "NTA.  Look at that shiny spine. Your mom is definitely the don\u2019t rock the boat ideology. Do not participate in that.", "NTA - your girlfriend being willing to put up with your dad to meet you mom is nice of her, but you weren\u2019t willing to put up with him and that\u2019s completely your right \n\nI wouldn\u2019t stick around him either \n\nScrew that noise\n\nI feel sorry for your mom", "NTA\n\nSet a precedent(?) that he can\u2019t to that to your gf. If you rolled over and let it happen it would just continue.", "Take your mom out for a meal and she can meet your girlfriend in a nice, relaxed setting without that judgemental asshole ruining the mood.", "\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f \n\neverybody ever should read that post. i have it saved, myself. the analogy is spot on.", "But think of the carbs!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
