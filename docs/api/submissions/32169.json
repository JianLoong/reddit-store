All these people who keep saying I have to take in my neighbor's package no you don't it's not yours if they're ordering something let them take care of it themselves.\n\nYou're not being harsh at all they were compromising the comfort safety of both the building the tenant and the landlord.

I know the worry about damage, animals & theft have been brought up because of insurance, but the big thing is the possibility of someone being assaulted.  \n\nThe front door is your 1st line of defense.

Some one gets sexually assaulted the landlord could be sued as well as the person that left the door open.

I could see OP being the AH if the door was propped open for a short period of time and AND the neighbor was still on site (I am thinking something like they moved large boxes) and just hadn\u2019t closed it yet. But to leave it open for however long when they are not even there makes them completely the AH.", "Also, nothing kept that tenant from leaving his or her key in some spot for his friend - like an envelope in their mailbox, or a jar tucked somewhere.", "And even then, if I don't see vehicles outside the door in the driveway, I'm closing it!  Because some of my neighbors will drive away and come back and think it's perfectly okay to go away for an hour and leave the door open.  At my last apartment, I stole the kickstand off the door because the springiness was worn off and it kept falling down every time the door was opened and people were too dumb to bother closing the door behind them - so I just unscrewed it one morning.

One night my bf forgot to shut it before we went to bed, and he woke up in the middle of the night to go to the kitchen and found a whole family of raccoons had decided to visit! Even funnier, as he was trying to shoo them out, our cat (who is usually a killer) just sat next to one of the raccoons looking up at him like she was on their side! I wish he'd gotten pics, I was asleep and missed the whole thing. He never forgets the window anymore.", "I've gotten whiffs of it before. It can be almost vomit inducing, it's so horrible.

As long as the front door stays locked, you did the right thing!", "Eh.... can't really decide.  \nI personally would have just closed the door and left it with that. Only if it happened more times would I escalate the situation like that to the Landlord.\n\nSo you kinda overreacted by immediately going to the landlord, but on the other hand it is a safety concern and really, having the door \"wide open\" as you said, would be absolutely unnecessary in this situations and there would have been better ways for your neighbor to handle this...  \n\n\nSo in conclusion, I guess I will go with a NTA afterall.", "Life is too short.

You could have easily  kicked the doorstop away  shut the door and spoke to the neighbours later that day instead of immediately going to the landlord.  For all you knew they had misplaced their key and left that door open for a locksmith to get in or they were going to be carrying furniture up the stairs. There's a whole host of  perfectly acceptable reasons people block doors open. \n\nYour neighbour - for knowing the issues in the area and leaving the door open for their friend  telling no one about it and then going out rather than giving their friend a key.", "NTA.

Sleep with a clear conscience.", "NTA. Your neighbor endangered the whole community with this selfishness.

Ask your family how much money they have set aside to help you out when the building gets burned down or your apartment gets robbed or you get attacked.", "NTA.  I would report them again.  now that you know exactly who it was, you should forward that conversation/altercation to the landlord.", "NTA", "NTA, your neighbor is an idiot and a liability. They can either lock the door or get locked out.", "NTA\n\n...and not too harsh.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIn the world around us in these troubled times? Hell, no, you are NTA! \n\nYour neighbor who left it open is acting as if he is a nitwit, and his getting angry with you is over the top.  He's the one who left the house wide open and vulnerable,, not you.  This is a personal safety issue and affects everyone living there, as well as being an insurance nightmare if the apartments are burgled when a door is left open.\n\nIt seems like there's always someone who messes stuff like this up. \n\nDoes each tenant (including you) have their own, interior door that can be locked? That could help, if so, but the outer door is still important.  The neighbor is living in a dream world if he thinks a burglar or that pyromaniac won't notice the door being open. People like that are very good observers and notice most everything.\n\nThe landlord needs to get on this right away. Is there a clause in the lease that says the front door (and the back?) is never to be left open if unattended? Violations of the terms of the lease can be cause for eviction.  If there is no such clause,  the very least he needs to do is add it when the leases come up for renewal. I'm not sure if he could add it to an existing lease, though. \n\nYou might try to recruit your other neighbors in your quest for better compliance with security-related rules. My apartment building has a secured front door that we all need a key fob to unlock, and then we have keys to our apartments. My apartment door is always locked, no matter which side of it I'm on. It even gets locked when I go down to get my mail or to take the trash to the compactor room. \n\nHe is putting everyone else at risk because he can't plan properly to let his friends in the house.  Stick to your guns and continue to monitor the situation  One thing you might do is invest in one of those \"light bulb\" security cameras. I think you can record what happens in the area under watch, which might come in handy if you think ol' loose rules will be doing this again.  If it were me, I'd buy the camera myself, so it won't depend on anyone else being vigilant and careful. \n\nGood luck and hope you stay safe and sound.", "NTA OP\n\nI live in a locked apartment building. I enjoy the luxury of that locked building. People at my building, till they left, would place a rock to keep the door open.

I don't think they are way expensive, and it might help you prove your case.", "You are so right, and men don't understand the fears that women have to deal with every. single. day.

The issue left everyone in that building at risk for several things, including the fool who left the door open himself. Sometimes we needt to step up and do the right thing, which in this case is to make an issue of it.", "It's good that your cat did nothing.  Raccoons are *mean,* and can do a lot of damage.
