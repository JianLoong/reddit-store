We live at the forest and because of such behaviour, we already had rats and a fox in the house! Also a few months ago there was an issue with a pyromaniac in the area, looking for open frontdoors and setting houses on fire. That guy was never caught. So because of that and because I wouldn't notice anything going on at the door living on the upper floor, I called the landlord and reported it. They were absolutely shocked and called all of us tenants for an emergency meeting, where it was clearly stated, if something like this gets ever noticed again, there will be an eviction for safety issues and violation of house rules.

Not your fault.", "Nope, you're not the asshole for reporting the open front door. Safety's a big deal, especially with your history of critters and that scary pyromaniac on the loose. Rules are there for a reason, and leaving the door wide open, especially with a doorstopper, is just asking for trouble.

Just because he didn't want to be inconvenienced. If you have someone coming over you wait for them you don't let a stranger into your building and jeopardize the safety and comfort of the other tenants\n\nThat's for not talking to them and not taking in their packages you're not their parent let them take care of their own stuff. All these people who keep saying I have to take in my neighbor's package no you don't it's not yours if they're ordering something let them take care of it themselves.\n\nYou're not being harsh at all they were compromising the comfort safety of both the building the tenant and the landlord. The landlord's right next time that happens eviction.", "NTA\n\nI lost a very valuable bicycle like that. The insurers told me to piss off bcs Door Open\". That was also 4 apts in one bldg, one of them actually removed the lock for the front door for a while.", "Nta, they are for sure, tho.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to live in a secure building.  Your neighbour not only left the door unlocked, but left it wide open. What was the point of that?\n\nThere is no other way you could have handled this.", "NTA", "It won't be too harsh when the fire starter comes along, burns everything down and the insurance won't pay because someone left the door open.\n\nYour response to your neighbour was reasonable. \n\nNTA", "Absolutely 100% NTA..the neighbor who propped open the door is a typical self entitled individual who projects their lack of due diligence on others..The neighbor is pissed at the fact that they were called out on their poor decision..\nWhat kind of mind would believe that leaving a security door open is a good thing?\nJeez, we live in a strange world..", "NTA. Now that the door-opener has outed themselves, you and the other two roommates with brains should inform the landlord who the culprit was.", "Nope, NTA. It is a safety issue.  \n\nAlso, the friend that was staying there, probably not allowed either, most leases state any guest staying longer than 2 nights you have to tell landlord about.", "NTA.  WTF is wrong with that person?  How is it possible that they are so comfortable being that stupid?\n\n!updateme", "NTA. Potentially a matter of literal life and death; you acted to protect yourself and everyone.", "your neighbour didnt even need to say anything and no one would have knew who it was, they dropped themselves in it when they opened their mouth, your NTA", "I would let the landlord know which neighbour it was and why they left it open\u2026 NTA", "NTA, and you should report what the offending neighbor said as to why the door had been left open to the landlord and let the landlord deal with it.", "NTA she is causing a HUGE safety risk by leaving the door open for random strangers. Also side note, kinda wondering how the fox in the house went.", "Your neighbor has \"main character\" syndrome.  His needs and his guests are to accommodated contrary to established policy and to the danger or everyone else living there.  Your neighbor is an asshole with only care for himself and nonsensical criticism for the rest of you.    \n\n>fter the meeting, one of my neighbours started cussing me out, how I dare to rat them out, \n\nId tell the neighbor I will be more than happy to do it again & again & again each time I see the door wide open like that.  NTA", "No you\u2019re not as asshole, you\u2019re a rat.", "NTA. To hell with people who treat shared spaces like their own", "NTA. Who leaves a front door ajar because their friend is coming to stay", "Nta that person could have caused break ins! The gall!", "NTA too bad you're not gonna risk the safety of my residence because you are too lazy to get a key copy. You were not to harsh they were an AH and putting everyone at risk.", "NTA The people who are affected by what happened are you and the other two families in the apartments and they all agree you were right. Any one else it has fuck all to do with them and they need to mind their own business", "NTA. Even if the neighbor couldn't be home for some reason, they could have easily contacted any one of you to ask if you'd open the door. It sounds like they were just hoping to keep it open for a few days for their friend to come and go, which is extra crazy.", "NTA for being concerned. Definitely a bit of tool for running to the landleech and threatening someone's entire shelter over it.", "They left the door open \n\nThere\u2019s someone in the area looking for open doors to set fires \n\nYeah, NTA OP , your neighbors are though", "NTA.  While it would have been disturbing to find the door unlocked, standing propped open so it is extremely noticeable is another.\n\nNever worry about an asshole calling you an asshole.  Your fellow tenants that follow the rules concur.", "NTA, no one would have known what neighbor it was if they hadn't acted out.\n\nThey ratted on themselves.\n\nWould your neighbour pay for damages if anything happened because of this? No.\n\nYou're looking after your own safety. Screw them", "NTA.  The rule is there for good reasons, so breaking it is unacceptable and needed to be reported.  Talking to this neighbor first probably would have been a waste of time anyway.", "NTA.  Who is to say the friend coming to stay for a few days isn't one of those you're worried about.", "NTA at all, they could have copied the key unless a security one and given their friend the spare.\n\nanimals are known to scent mark new areas and since this is new to them....", "NTA. Propping open a door on a shared building is only acceptable if someone is actually down there loading/unloading something.", "NTA.  I do understand.  If this not a recurring happening, speaking with your neighbors would have been a better route to go.", "That reason doesn't make it okay for him to leave the door open.", "NTA and I notice that the people siding with you are actually affected by this issue, whereas the people telling you you're too harsh have absolutely no interest in what is going on.", "NTA. The thing is you didn\u2019t eat out your neighbor, you didn\u2019t know who did it.", "NTA.  I know the worry about damage, animals & theft have been brought up because of insurance, but the big thing is the possibility of someone being assaulted.  \n\nThe front door is your 1st line of defense. Once someone looking to harm another gets in they are that much closer to harming an unsuspecting tenant. Some one gets sexually assaulted the landlord could be sued as well as the person that left the door open.  Heaven forbid the assault leads to a murder.  \n\nWhat that tenant did was dangerous and put everyone at risk.  Please inform the landlord and let them deal with it. This is just one more reason to always make sure your personal door is secure and locked.", "No. Just...no. that's a huge violation, one that could have put everyone in the building in danger.\n\nNTA. You would have been stupid not to report it.", "NTA. The friend could also arrive when the neighbor would be home. You don't endanger everyone else for your convenience.", "No! NTA , you were trying to keep them safe, and its not like anyone knew that it was the specific neighbor . They just shouldn\u2019t do it again.", "NTA.  Stuff like this is why I'm saving so hard to buy a townhome with my own entrance so I don't have to deal with shared entrance spaces anymore. People are animals.", "Nta", "you are right and NTA", "NTA", "Nta, Your neighbor is wrong to leave the door propped but you are a busy body.", "NTA, but boy howdy your neighbours are. \n\nIn Finland we have this thing called 'kusipelti' for situations like these.", "I might be alarmed but still laugh at a fox, but rats? Ugh, who wants rats? I would also prefer my home not to be burgled or burned down. I don't leave my front door unlocked, much less standing open, so this is ridiculous.  \n\nDon't accept his packages,  don't accept his apology if he has one, and don't let this go. It's completely unacceptable to put you and your other neighbors at risk because he is lazy.", "NTA\u2026The tenant violated the rules and it was an important rule at that. The neighbor that had no problem with would change his tune pretty quick if his pad was robbed because the door was left open!  They would also blame you for not reporting it.", "Agreed. I could see OP being the AH if the door was propped open for a short period of time and AND the neighbor was still on site (I am thinking something like they moved large boxes) and just hadn\u2019t closed it yet. But to leave it open for however long when they are not even there makes them completely the AH.", "Also, nothing kept that tenant from leaving his or her key in some spot for his friend - like an envelope in their mailbox, or a jar tucked somewhere.", "And even then, if I don't see vehicles outside the door in the driveway, I'm closing it!  Because some of my neighbors will drive away and come back and think it's perfectly okay to go away for an hour and leave the door open.  At my last apartment, I stole the kickstand off the door because the springiness was worn off and it kept falling down every time the door was opened and people were too dumb to bother closing the door behind them - so I just unscrewed it one morning.  The landlord never bothered to replace it.", "several tenants here lost bicycles like that because student tenants kept sabotaging the door (every time we repaired it, they would bend the door's strike plate until the lock wouldn't latch ).", "Fox pee smells god awful. You WOULD NOT want them marking the foyer\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e", "Also foxes can carry scabies, you DO NOT WANT THAT. it can take months to years to get rid of and if fox wandered in for some hours laying down where you lay down? Have fun itching all. The. Time.", "In my case, a skunk!", "We don't have central a/c, and sometimes leave the window in the living room open in warm weather. One night my bf forgot to shut it before we went to bed, and he woke up in the middle of the night to go to the kitchen and found a whole family of raccoons had decided to visit! Even funnier, as he was trying to shoo them out, our cat (who is usually a killer) just sat next to one of the raccoons looking up at him like she was on their side! I wish he'd gotten pics, I was asleep and missed the whole thing. He never forgets the window anymore.", "I've gotten whiffs of it before. It can be almost vomit inducing, it's so horrible. Yeah I wouldn't want the door open if there was the potential for that.", "Also, foxes can carry the rabies virus.", "I'm gonna be real.  I've learned a lot about foxes today. Disney really had me believing a different narrative.", "Or rabies. I saw a video of a rabid fox attacking a door trying to get at the person filming and it was TERRIFYING.", "So cute,  but it's still not something I want to see. I fear the stinky."]}
