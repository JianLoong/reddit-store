The house rules state clearly, the frontdoor needs to be locked for safety reasons. So I came home yesterday from grocery shopping and the door was wide open, even fixed with a doorstopper, so the door wouldn't close. None of the cars of my neighbours were in front of the house, I knocked and rang the bells of them but no answer, so one of them opened the door and drove off. I admit, I was angry. We live at the forest and because of such behaviour, we already had rats and a fox in the house! Also a few months ago there was an issue with a pyromaniac in the area, looking for open frontdoors and setting houses on fire. That guy was never caught. So because of that and because I wouldn't notice anything going on at the door living on the upper floor, I called the landlord and reported it. They were absolutely shocked and called all of us tenants for an emergency meeting, where it was clearly stated, if something like this gets ever noticed again, there will be an eviction for safety issues and violation of house rules. Additionally it's an insurance issue. If something gets damaged or someone breaks into an apartment cause they could get in through the open frontdoor, insurances won't pay a dime. After the meeting, one of my neighbours started cussing me out, how I dare to rat them out, they had left the door open for a friend who wanted to stay for a few days and doesn't have a key to the front door. I argued against it, if they expect a visitor, they should stay at home and let them in, those visitors not having a key is no ones problem but theirs and drove home. Now I refuse to talk to that neighbour and refuse to accept their parcels (which I always did before). I told my family and they said, I was too harsh, I should've waited for my neighbours to come back to talk to them first, while the other 2 neighbours side with me. So I come here for judgement.

Your neighbor is in the wrong for leaving the door open when there are safety concerns such as the ones you mentioned, and the friend who was staying with them who couldn\u2019t get in because they didn\u2019t have a key?  Not your fault.", "Nope, you're not the asshole for reporting the open front door. Safety's a big deal, especially with your history of critters and that scary pyromaniac on the loose. Rules are there for a reason, and leaving the door wide open, especially with a doorstopper, is just asking for trouble. Sure, it's a bummer for your neighbor's friend without a key, but that's something they should've sorted out themselves. You did what you felt was right to keep everyone safe, and sometimes that means making the tough calls.", "Nta. It\u2019s a safety and insurance issue for you and your neighbors. It\u2019s literally in the rules set by the landlord.", "NTA.  Not only is it stupid to risk the safety of the entire building for the convenience of a visitor....\n\nIt's probably a violation of the lease terms, also.", "No, NTA. I'm dealing with a similar problem where I live. If I could prove who it is, I would report them; I already know, but it's just hearsay at this point. \n\nThe only time it's acceptable is during an active move-in / move-out.", "NTA.
