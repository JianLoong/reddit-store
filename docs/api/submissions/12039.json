After my mom died when I was 6, it was my grandma who was the woman I felt the most comfortable seeking guidance and comfort from, not my stepmom who married my dad 18 months later. Grandma has always been an important person in my life in her own right but after losing mom she was even more special because she was a connection to my mom when my connections dwindled. After dad got back on the dating scene he packed up all traces of mom from the house and left them in the attic. When he got remarried he told me, in an effort to spare feelings, I needed to add some photos of my stepmom to my photo board that was in my room. He said it would be difficult for her to see me only post photos of him, mom and other family and not her. So while dad and my stepmom wanted me to turn to her, to lean on her as a motherly figure and have her take the primary spot of female influence, it was my grandma who was that for me. \n\nFrom the ages of about 11 to 20 my relationship with my stepmom was the worst. She (and my dad) tried to reduce my access to my grandma in order for me to form the bond with her that they wanted me to have and I resented them for it. My relationship with my dad never recovered. She did apologize for it when she realized that even as an adult I would turn to grandma and that all her efforts to make us closer, to be a mother to me, had pushed me away because I allowed contact to all but end. It didn't make me love her and it didn't make me closer to her exactly. But I appreciated that she had been trying to do what she thought was best and healthiest, even if it was something that I didn't like. I also appreciate that I was more distant with her than most would think of as normal. And that I never did give her a chance to be more to me than she is.\n\nWe have contact, her, my dad and me. But I am still not close to them. I am engaged to my wonderful fianc\u00e9e and we are getting married in November. I asked my grandma if she would want to do a dance with me, in place of a mother son dance, to honor what she has been to me but also to honor my mom. She said yes and even picked the most amazing song for it. My other grandmother, dad's mom, knows what has been going on and joked on Facebook that I'd need to take dance lessons if I go through two spotlight dances. My dad and stepmom saw this and inquired and found out I was dancing with my grandma. This led to them saying I should be doing one with my stepmom too. Dad was more pushy, stepmom was more hopeful that I would be willing. Dad said after all these years and after denying her the chance at being close to me, the least I could do is honor her efforts with a mother-son type dance. I told him I was doing the dance with grandma instead of my stepmom and that was my decision. He told me it was the wrong one and she deserved it more.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678531038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ogz41/aita_for_choosing_to_have_a_spotlight_dance_with/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your grandma sounds like a great person and this is a good way to honor her", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding - it should reflect what you want. All the drama about your stepmom was unnecessary detail here, because even if she was great and really respected your space and your wishes, the fact that you wanted to have the dance with your grandmother would still be the only relevant fact.", "NTA, that is beautiful, stick to your guns. You would think your dad would have learned that by trying to force a relationship that isn\u2019t there he is only driving a wedge between the three of you. Don\u2019t let him bully you.

Step parents who force themselves on unwilling kids are the worst. Your wedding isn't the time to pander to your step mom's feelings. She needs to swallow her own insecurities and let you and your finance enjoy your day.

It's up to you who you honor with a spotlight dance, not your parents choice.", "NTA. Sounds like they're working on getting uninvited and NC, instead of just low contact.

But due to your dads insistence about your stepmoms involvement you may want to have people watch him so he won't do something to hurt you and mess up your wedding.\n\nMy ex and i divorced when my kids were 2 and 3, we separated by when they were 6mo& 18mo.  He got them at least once a month on weekends & less as they got older & had their own interests.  One child had 13 surgeries in 3 yrs he showed up for 1 surgery.  Background to give you insight to how selfish he was & amt of time  spent w him.\n\nFast forward to wedding.  My son the groom, planned to walk me to my seat. His dad wanted him to walk his stepmom but he refused.  So after i had been seated in the aisle as all mothers of the groom, are ex jumped  up and walked his wife and sat her in the aisle (i moved over to not cause a scene olus all the other rows were filled up). Then he wasn't done he went, while the bridesmaids were coming in and walked my other sons gf who was already seated, and sat her between me & his exwife.  He ended up taking the aisle seat.  I couldnt see anything because decorations were in front of me because no one was supposed to sit there.  He still wasnt done.  During the mother son dance he pulled his wife out and danced with her.  I said nothing negative thru all of this.\n\nThe stepmother knew he was wrong and apologized for his behavior but that is lke a mirror thats been broken, you cant make.it right again.  Only one wedding & one chance to see my son get married & he ruined it.  He was still pissed about it so when we were all at the family table every single person except my ex talked to me.\n\nSo please have someone be on the lookout for your dad's behavior because he sounds like he might try something like that.", "She doesn't deserve anything more at OPs wedding than what they choose to give them.", "The moment step moms feelings over rode the child\u2019s feelings, she didn\u2019t deserve anything.", "They're not paying for the wedding. I am nowhere near close enough to my dad to even accept if he offered but he never would.", "His father literally made him put pictures of his step mother on his picture board because \u201cit might her feelings if she\u2019s not included.\u201d Please give me a break. She deserves nothing and neither does his father.", "Why? That isn't what he wants", "Oh my gosh! I am so sorry this happened to you. What a flaming narcissist! I can see why he is your ex!"]}
