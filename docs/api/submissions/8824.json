When he came home, I decided to go to the gym. When I came back, I found that he had put together a significant chunk of the legos without me. I asked why he did that and he said that he wanted to unwind after work and help me out with the lego set. He didn\u2019t even ask if it was okay for him to put them together, he just did. \n\nI got pretty upset and told him that the set wasn\u2019t his, it\u2019s mine, and he should\u2019ve asked to do some of it if he wanted to or at least waited until I was home so we could do it together. I think most of the fun of a Lego set comes from putting it together. He said I was overreacting and it wasn\u2019t a big deal because I still got to do the majority of the set. \n\nI think I\u2019m just gonna take apart the pieces he put together. Am I overreacting?

No but yeah that was pretty lame of him.\nFortunately with lego you can always take apart the parts he did. \n\nI just hope he didnt do any sticker placements, at that point its truly cruel \ud83d\ude02", "Definitely not an overreaction. But you should make HIM take the pieces apart, not you. It was totally a violation.

It'd be like finishing someone's painting or sculpture.  Or going on a cruise but saying they did it for you.  LEGO is about the building experience.\n\nThat being said, you can pull it apart and build it again like you said.  Talk to your BF and make sure he understands that it is your project and if he wants to build something with you, that is awesome but it would be a different project.\n\nI wouldn't want someone finishing my build either.  I'd have been upset too.", "No, it\u2019s like he ate half of your birthday cake right off your plate. NTA, that was a dick move.", "NTA that was a jerk move on his part and inconsiderate.

It's open for our use as long as we schedule in advance, buy our own supplies, and tidy up. He goes to the cabin himself a few times a year. \n\nHe always has a work-in-progress jigsaw puzzle on one of the tables. And he gets such a kick when guests help to complete it.  At this rate, I don't even think he works on it himself.", "NTA. It is your set, your gift, and if he wants to build Lego he can buy his own.

Am I overreacting?\n\nUh, what? Are you paranoid he built something incorrectly? Or you're bizarrely needing to have clicked down every brick yourself? \n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nHe should have asked, but you overreacted and your \"solution\" to re-do his section is weird and will escalate what should have not even been an argument.", "My vote is NAH.  \n\nIt\u2019s kind of like a jigsaw puzzle.  In some families, if someone starts a puzzle and leaves it out it\u2019s kind of understood that anyone can drop in and work on it for a bit.  In other families, that puzzle belongs to the person who started working on it and nobody would touch it without asking first. \n\nIt sounds like you might have grown up in families with very different norms about these types of things and didn\u2019t realize it so you could have a conversation about it.  \n\nYou\u2019re totally NTA if you ask him not to work on your Lego sets, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s TA either.

What I am thinking is there are two grownups who can\u2019t agree on something this simple and move on. You guys needs to focus on that more than legos.", "Uh yeah, a 2000 piece set is fucking expensive too. I'd be mad if my $350 present was half taken by my so without even texting that he was doing it", "Agreed, and most of the fun in legos is building it, he just took away part of the experience", "I've learned this lesson the hard way. I normally did puzzles by myself as a kid and got *way* too focused on finishing them. So when my mom wanted to do one with me a couple of weeks ago, I finished it without her. She made me feel like a right AH for doing it too, which wasn't unwarranted. Lesson learned, lmao.", "Interesting! At our house, if a puzzle is out, it a communal thing and everyone is welcome to work on it. We have a you snooze, you lose policy. That being said, it is known to be the established culture in our house. I think the bf learned lego culture at his house.", "Is it that weird? I think most of the fun is putting it together.

That means you can move on to the next one at a faster pace, so your loss isn't a loss for a long time.", "Its not weird to redo the part he did for the enjoyment of the build. My husband and kid have rebuilt sets the other built first so ignore this person. The video game analogy is spot on.", "I'm someone who has an entire room of Lego, and yes I think the fun is both in putting it together and in the end result. \n\nBut if someone in my family did a section (how much could he really have completed while you were at the gym?), I wouldn't bother disassembling anything unless I thought there was an issue with the build.", "Also it's pretty easy to undo a puzzle and then have the same experience putting it together. It's significantly harder if not impossible to do so with lego.", "That was rude. The least he could have done was text you asking if it was okay for him to put some together. \n\nNTA.

The reason for the YTA is your reaction, your bf could simply not know that it's so important to you or that completing the set upsets you.

If anything,  you're under-reacting. You never, ever touch someone else's Lego build without their express permission. And you don't get upset when you're told no. Lego is for hoarding, not for sharing. You bf is a fool.  Also,  the plural for Lego bricks is Lego.
