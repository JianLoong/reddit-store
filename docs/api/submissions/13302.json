If my wife was in the ER, for any reason, my ass would be there.  I'd have left my family and gone straight to her.  Yes, from 2,000 miles away.  I've said this in quite a few posts before, and I'll probably say it a lot more in this sub.  When you are married here's the order of importance of people in your life: Yourself, Your Child, Your Spouse, Everyone Else On The Planet.  For him, #2 and #3 were in the ER and you're having contractions at 20 weeks?  His, and his family's response is pathetic.\n\n~~Obviously, we don't know the rest of your relationship, but I'd be taking a hard look at how else he treats you, because this is not a good look.~~\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit based on OP edit:  That's even worse.  He knows you're going into the ER and gets shitfaced rather than look for updates?  I insulted shit with my opening statement.\n\nEdit 2 to add based on OP comment below: Now I'm furious on your behalf.  You had a pregnancy terminated for non-viability in the past and he still reacts like this?  Time for family therapy maybe, therapy for him for sure.  If he cannot come around and be supportive then he needs to be the ex-husband.", "NTA. And he needs to learn the difference between 'having a drink' and 'getting shit-faced'.  I'd also question the care of family that encourage him to ignore his pregnant hospitalized spouse. Lot to unpack there.", "NTA. He's being manipulative, using his dad's death to guilt-trip you and playing to the gallery. It's noticeable that neither he nor his family show the slightest concern for the fact you could have been losing HIS CHILD.", "NTA. Interesting that there's some 'past shit' that you apparently need to let go. Well, there's some current shit he's causing, and probably some future shit he's going to deal you too. \n\nIt sounds as though you told him you were bleeding and cramping, that you were going to ER and THEN he chose to turn off his phone and get drunk. He seemingly had no interest in how you were or whether his child was still OK. This is unacceptable. He's already a father. He needs to step up now. \n\nI guess you need to have a long chat before this baby arrives about whether he can step up or not. Tell him the future doesn't involve not drinking, but it will involve responsibilities, priorities and care for each other. If he can't handle that now, before the baby is born, how will he cope in a few months' time?", "NTA I would be absolutely livid. You being really sick is as much his problem as yours. Not to mention you are pregnant, so there is risk for the baby. He needs to recognise that even though he is spending time with his family, that you are also his family, and there are times when you need to be more important ESPECIALLY IF YOUR CHILD IS AT RISK TOO!!! If you aren't as much his family as his relatives, then he doesn't deserve to be with you.", "NTA.   I would have messaged that same family group chat with the following message.  \u201cI am so sorry that me going to the hospital at 20 weeks pregnant with our child and letting you know would cause you to go out and get shit faced.  I really have no idea what I am about to tell you next might cause you do.  The doctor said that I have severe UTI, that is on the verge of becoming a kidney infection.  Hence, why I was experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions and a fever.  By all means I know that you lost your father 7 months ago and you should be able to enjoy your family time without me having to be such a drama queen.  But I just though that as the father of this baby that I am carrying, you should be aware of what\u2019s happening.  Sorry if you thought I was trying to control your vacation tome with your family that was never my intention.  By the way tell your sister that I am truly sorry for interrupting your family time, l will make sure not to that again.  Please continue to enjoy yourself if anything else important comes up I will wait until you get home and inform you.\u201d  Then I would shut my phone off until I go back home.  Let the chips fall where they fall.  Two can play at being AH.  By the way him messaging that family group chat is an embarrassment on him not you.  Your husband is the AH and don\u2019t be afraid to let him know that.", "Wow, so he knew you were headed to the hospital, and there was a potential for a serious diagnosis for you and/or your unborn child? A husband/father who gave a shit would have stayed sober to see if the diagnosis warranted him dropping everything immediately to travel to be with you. But he instead got wasted, and ignored your messages. **AND THEN** he played the victim and got his sister to help. Does the sister even know you were in the hospital?\n\nYou always hear of husbands showing their true face when their wives get pregnant because the wife is now \"trapped\" and the husband doesn't have to pretend to be nice anymore. This is his true face.\n\nThe silver lining here is you know now that you cannot depend on him. You need to plan the rest of your life with that in mind.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You went to the ER. He knew you were going the ER. He knew you were bleeding. He knew that you could lose the baby. He then just blows you off and gets drunk(er) instead of at least staying in contact with you. The bare minimum would\u2019ve been to stop drinking, go to a quiet area and keep in contact with you. He acts like your health and the baby\u2019s health don\u2019t matter.   \n\n\nI hate hospitals too. I\u2019m praying for a safe delivery. Be well.", "NTA.  He knew before he was tanked that you were going to the ER.  I'm not expecting he jump on a plane to get to you, but the least he could have done was make sure his phone was on him to make sure you and baby were alright.  And his family sucks too for encouraging him to relax and ignore his phone.   Someone else said you could reach him thru his family, you should not have to do that.  He should be concerned about the welfare of his wife and child enough to be available when HE KNOWS you're at the hospital.", "INFO was he already drunk when you were going to the ER? From my point of view, that makes or breaks your case - if he knew something was up with you and the baby and *then* got drunk, he's TA. If he didn't, you can't blame him for drinking with his family (not knowing you are having health problems).", "That was the alcohol talking.  \"I/Me\" gets real defensive and self absorbed when fueled by drink.\n\nOf course, NTA!\n\nHe's let the drunkenness make a mess.  I hope you feel better soon.", "Nta you shouldn\u2019t even have to ask this. Even if husband and you are in different states the second he found out you were going to the Er he should of had his phone on standby just incase or to text and comfort you. Contractions at 20 weeks should be taken seriously you are not overreacting.", "NTA \u2026he\u2019s going to be as good a dad as he is a husband. You might want to think on that. You and your baby were at risk, and he cares more about drinking with his extended family and then gets publicly pissy at you for being annoyed at that? \n\nHe\u2019s trying out (clumsily, but he\u2019ll get better with more experience if you let him) a good old bit of childlike emotional manipulation. Do you really want to tolerate a petulant and immature asshole?", "NTA, but jeez, if you're telling this the way it happened you sure are married to one. Why the blazes are you having a kid with this guy? You've already GOT a kid, and it's your husband.", "Yikes, NTA OP. Looking at the discord comments it seems like he is spinning a tale to his family, I\u2019d clear this up with someone else who is there. \n\nBut also, your husband is acting extremely problematic, he doesn\u2019t seem to care that you are in hospital, your baby may be at risk, or that you may need support. The fact that his family wasn\u2019t also equally concerned, given how your past pregnancy ended, shows they don\u2019t care much about you either. \n\nI\u2019d be setting some firm boundaries with them all, including your husband. You are about to have a child, your husband shouldn\u2019t be treating you like this, regardless of his father passing. Parenting is a full time job, he needs to be contacted at all times, and his family encouraged him of the opposite, knowing you were going to the ER.\n\nLastly, I hope you have some people in your corner too OP. If you have family or friends that maybe you could stay with, it might be best. You shouldn\u2019t be alone atm.", "Nta. But ignoring someone in response their asshole behavior isn't how a solid marriage will grow  rethink this marriage", "NTA. What a gross, disgusting guilt trip your husband tried to pin on you.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. He has serious issues.", "NTA if my partner told me they were in the ER no matter what I was doing or how far my butt would be there", "This is unacceptable behaviour from your husband. Seek support elsewhere and well, maybe professional advise from a counselo6and a lawyer. This is what's going to be like whenever you ask him to look after his own child, or whatever else happens.", "> Ok sorry I wanted to have a drink one time with my family after my dad passed Ill never take a sip of alcohol again just for you \n\nIs your husband actually a passive aggressive teenage girl? Cause that's what he sounds like. \n\nNTA but your husband sure is", "> im currently 20 weeks pregnant with **my** first child\n\nI think you subconsciously already decided what to do. NTA.", "NTA, but some INFO missing\n\nIf I understood right: You informed him about going to the ER. Instead of staying in touch with you and ask about your wellbeing, he decided to get drunk and do not respond to any of your messages.\nAbout which time interval are we speaking that you send you send those 20 messages? Did he e.g. get the call in the morning and did not care for you until the evening? Or was it more like \"I am going to ER, hopefully nothing severe\" and next call was 2h later? Are you in general a person that is often going to ER or making drama?\n\nE.g. my SIL is always getting sick when my brother isn't there for the night. She once called him at midnight if he can drive home (3h drive). He refused and as a sister I supported him there.\nSame for my father. He is going to the ER a lot when he's alone because \"something is wrong with his heart\" (he's always fine). So I am wondering if your husband is really annoyed by you the last months and has a different kind of view to that situation.\n\nE.g. he sees his family the first time after bis father's death and you are acting like 7 months should be enough time to grieve. This is a little bit unsensitive.\nAt the same time you sound like you supported him by seeing his family, so why I don't think you are a bad person.", "It might not be too late for an abortion- here in the UK they go up to 24 weeks. I would not have a child with this man. He\u2019s being bad enough to you now but once he has your child to use as leverage he\u2019ll make you truly miserable.", "There\u2019s a lot going on here but it mostly sounds like miscommunication with a side of alcohol. Your husband got caught up drinking with his family... that\u2019s usually going to go sideways. You were with your family so in theory, you were fine. Not feeling great but had support. \n\nTotally understand why you didn\u2019t want to talk to your husband, he screwed up but if you\u2019re trying to read more in to this situation it\u2019s never helpful. Stick to the facts. \n\nCould, woulda, shoulda doesn\u2019t matter cause it didn\u2019t happen. Married people don\u2019t share a brain so hearing the other person\u2019s perspective is the key to finding solutions. What will you do next time something happens? Look for solutions not more problems. \n\nHappy you\u2019re feeling better but try not to ignore health concerns in the future.\n\nNTA\n\nETA \u2014 if this is the first time your husband is seeing his family since his Dad passed, it\u2019s not hard to understand why his focus was somewhere else. He\u2019s still an asshole.", "I'm going to go with NAH and prepare to be down voted for it. \n\nWhile yes his dad died 7 months ago, he may not have had the chance to go reminisce and grieve with his family since the passing. While yes, he got absolutely plastered, this isn't a capital offence. \n\n20 weeks is usually enough time before the birth, where being out of touch for a night or two usually isn't a problem, especially with two adults. \n\nIn saying that, you did get hospitalised, however he was in no condition to do anything at that point. With the level of inebriation I would have simply told my SO \"hey, we'll talk tomorrow.\" Rather than getting upset with them for drinking or being about of contact. \n\nI think it was just a high emotional and stressful time for all involved, and both can learn from this in the future by simply saying\n \"Hey, I'm going to go out drinking with my family.

He was the AH for airing all of your business and dragging you like this, your IL are AH for getting involved. In those days you were having contractions did you give him a heads up?

That\u2019s not outrageous.", "But did anyone ask you how you were, at all?", "As if SIL cared\u2026", "Yes... we all expect better of our husbands. Sadly, they are flawed human beings & don\u2019t always get it right. I would be pissed at my husband too but I also would only caring about myself & unborn child. No one needs the additional stress of drunk husbands & SIL bullshit.\n\nEta \u2014 I see no purpose for anyone adding stress to OP\u2019s plate by telling her, her husband sucks. She has enough on her plate already. Just worry about yourself & your baby. Just take a deep breath & feel better.", "The family encouraged him to put away his phone while knowing something was wrong with OP's health (hence sister asking about whether the baby was all right before berating OP for making a big deal out of her husband not answering his phone for hours). OP's inlaws are AHs and OP correcting the record about whether she allowed her husband to get drunk is not going to lessen their assholery toward her, considering they told him to ignore her while she was sick and pregnant."]}
