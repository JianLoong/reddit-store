If my wife was in the ER, for any reason, my ass would be there.  I'd have left my family and gone straight to her.  Yes, from 2,000 miles away.  I've said this in quite a few posts before, and I'll probably say it a lot more in this sub.  When you are married here's the order of importance of people in your life: Yourself, Your Child, Your Spouse, Everyone Else On The Planet.  For him, #2 and #3 were in the ER and you're having contractions at 20 weeks?  His, and his family's response is pathetic.\n\n~~Obviously, we don't know the rest of your relationship, but I'd be taking a hard look at how else he treats you, because this is not a good look.~~\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit based on OP edit:  That's even worse.  He knows you're going into the ER and gets shitfaced rather than look for updates?  I insulted shit with my opening statement.\n\nEdit 2 to add based on OP comment below: Now I'm furious on your behalf.  You had a pregnancy terminated for non-viability in the past and he still reacts like this?  Time for family therapy maybe, therapy for him for sure.  If he cannot come around and be supportive then he needs to be the ex-husband.", "NTA. And he needs to learn the difference between 'having a drink' and 'getting shit-faced'.  I'd also question the care of family that encourage him to ignore his pregnant hospitalized spouse. Lot to unpack there.", "NTA. He's being manipulative, using his dad's death to guilt-trip you and playing to the gallery. It's noticeable that neither he nor his family show the slightest concern for the fact you could have been losing HIS CHILD.", "NTA. Interesting that there's some 'past shit' that you apparently need to let go. Well, there's some current shit he's causing, and probably some future shit he's going to deal you too. \n\nIt sounds as though you told him you were bleeding and cramping, that you were going to ER and THEN he chose to turn off his phone and get drunk. He seemingly had no interest in how you were or whether his child was still OK. This is unacceptable. He's already a father. He needs to step up now. \n\nI guess you need to have a long chat before this baby arrives about whether he can step up or not. Tell him the future doesn't involve not drinking, but it will involve responsibilities, priorities and care for each other. If he can't handle that now, before the baby is born, how will he cope in a few months' time?", "NTA I would be absolutely livid. You being really sick is as much his problem as yours. Not to mention you are pregnant, so there is risk for the baby. He needs to recognise that even though he is spending time with his family, that you are also his family, and there are times when you need to be more important ESPECIALLY IF YOUR CHILD IS AT RISK TOO!!! If you aren't as much his family as his relatives, then he doesn't deserve to be with you.", "NTA.   I would have messaged that same family group chat with the following message.  \u201cI am so sorry that me going to the hospital at 20 weeks pregnant with our child and letting you know would cause you to go out and get shit faced.  I really have no idea what I am about to tell you next might cause you do.  The doctor said that I have severe UTI, that is on the verge of becoming a kidney infection.  Hence, why I was experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions and a fever.  By all means I know that you lost your father 7 months ago and you should be able to enjoy your family time without me having to be such a drama queen.  But I just though that as the father of this baby that I am carrying, you should be aware of what\u2019s happening.  Sorry if you thought I was trying to control your vacation tome with your family that was never my intention.  By the way tell your sister that I am truly sorry for interrupting your family time, l will make sure not to that again.  Please continue to enjoy yourself if anything else important comes up I will wait until you get home and inform you.\u201d  Then I would shut my phone off until I go back home.  Let the chips fall where they fall.  Two can play at being AH.  By the way him messaging that family group chat is an embarrassment on him not you.  Your husband is the AH and don\u2019t be afraid to let him know that.", "Wow, so he knew you were headed to the hospital, and there was a potential for a serious diagnosis for you and/or your unborn child? A husband/father who gave a shit would have stayed sober to see if the diagnosis warranted him dropping everything immediately to travel to be with you. But he instead got wasted, and ignored your messages. **AND THEN** he played the victim and got his sister to help. Does the sister even know you were in the hospital?\n\nYou always hear of husbands showing their true face when their wives get pregnant because the wife is now \"trapped\" and the husband doesn't have to pretend to be nice anymore. This is his true face.\n\nThe silver lining here is you know now that you cannot depend on him. You need to plan the rest of your life with that in mind.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You went to the ER. He knew you were going the ER. He knew you were bleeding. He knew that you could lose the baby. He then just blows you off and gets drunk(er) instead of at least staying in contact with you. The bare minimum would\u2019ve been to stop drinking, go to a quiet area and keep in contact with you. He acts like your health and the baby\u2019s health don\u2019t matter.   \n\n\nI hate hospitals too. I\u2019m praying for a safe delivery. Be well.", "NTA.  He knew before he was tanked that you were going to the ER.  I'm not expecting he jump on a plane to get to you, but the least he could have done was make sure his phone was on him to make sure you and baby were alright.  And his family sucks too for encouraging him to relax and ignore his phone.   Someone else said you could reach him thru his family, you should not have to do that.  He should be concerned about the welfare of his wife and child enough to be available when HE KNOWS you're at the hospital.", "INFO was he already drunk when you were going to the ER? From my point of view, that makes or breaks your case - if he knew something was up with you and the baby and *then* got drunk, he's TA. If he didn't, you can't blame him for drinking with his family (not knowing you are having health problems).", "That was the alcohol talking.  \"I/Me\" gets real defensive and self absorbed when fueled by drink.\n\nOf course, NTA!\n\nHe's let the drunkenness make a mess.  I hope you feel better soon.", "Nta you shouldn\u2019t even have to ask this. Even if husband and you are in different states the second he found out you were going to the Er he should of had his phone on standby just incase or to text and comfort you. Contractions at 20 weeks should be taken seriously you are not overreacting.", "NTA \u2026he\u2019s going to be as good a dad as he is a husband. You might want to think on that. You and your baby were at risk, and he cares more about drinking with his extended family and then gets publicly pissy at you for being annoyed at that? \n\nHe\u2019s trying out (clumsily, but he\u2019ll get better with more experience if you let him) a good old bit of childlike emotional manipulation. Do you really want to tolerate a petulant and immature asshole?", "NTA, but jeez, if you're telling this the way it happened you sure are married to one. Why the blazes are you having a kid with this guy? You've already GOT a kid, and it's your husband.", "Yikes, NTA OP. Looking at the discord comments it seems like he is spinning a tale to his family, I\u2019d clear this up with someone else who is there. \n\nBut also, your husband is acting extremely problematic, he doesn\u2019t seem to care that you are in hospital, your baby may be at risk, or that you may need support. The fact that his family wasn\u2019t also equally concerned, given how your past pregnancy ended, shows they don\u2019t care much about you either. \n\nI\u2019d be setting some firm boundaries with them all, including your husband. You are about to have a child, your husband shouldn\u2019t be treating you like this, regardless of his father passing. Parenting is a full time job, he needs to be contacted at all times, and his family encouraged him of the opposite, knowing you were going to the ER.\n\nLastly, I hope you have some people in your corner too OP. If you have family or friends that maybe you could stay with, it might be best. You shouldn\u2019t be alone atm.", "Nta. But ignoring someone in response their asshole behavior isn't how a solid marriage will grow  rethink this marriage", "NTA. What a gross, disgusting guilt trip your husband tried to pin on you.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. He has serious issues.", "NTA if my partner told me they were in the ER no matter what I was doing or how far my butt would be there", "This is unacceptable behaviour from your husband. Seek support elsewhere and well, maybe professional advise from a counselo6and a lawyer. This is what's going to be like whenever you ask him to look after his own child, or whatever else happens.", "> Ok sorry I wanted to have a drink one time with my family after my dad passed Ill never take a sip of alcohol again just for you \n\nIs your husband actually a passive aggressive teenage girl? Cause that's what he sounds like. \n\nNTA but your husband sure is", "> im currently 20 weeks pregnant with **my** first child\n\nI think you subconsciously already decided what to do. NTA.", "NTA, but some INFO missing\n\nIf I understood right: You informed him about going to the ER. Instead of staying in touch with you and ask about your wellbeing, he decided to get drunk and do not respond to any of your messages.\nAbout which time interval are we speaking that you send you send those 20 messages? Did he e.g. get the call in the morning and did not care for you until the evening? Or was it more like \"I am going to ER, hopefully nothing severe\" and next call was 2h later? Are you in general a person that is often going to ER or making drama?\n\nE.g. my SIL is always getting sick when my brother isn't there for the night. She once called him at midnight if he can drive home (3h drive). He refused and as a sister I supported him there.\nSame for my father. He is going to the ER a lot when he's alone because \"something is wrong with his heart\" (he's always fine). So I am wondering if your husband is really annoyed by you the last months and has a different kind of view to that situation.\n\nE.g. he sees his family the first time after bis father's death and you are acting like 7 months should be enough time to grieve. This is a little bit unsensitive.\nAt the same time you sound like you supported him by seeing his family, so why I don't think you are a bad person.", "It might not be too late for an abortion- here in the UK they go up to 24 weeks. I would not have a child with this man. He\u2019s being bad enough to you now but once he has your child to use as leverage he\u2019ll make you truly miserable.", "There\u2019s a lot going on here but it mostly sounds like miscommunication with a side of alcohol. Your husband got caught up drinking with his family... that\u2019s usually going to go sideways. You were with your family so in theory, you were fine. Not feeling great but had support. \n\nTotally understand why you didn\u2019t want to talk to your husband, he screwed up but if you\u2019re trying to read more in to this situation it\u2019s never helpful. Stick to the facts. \n\nCould, woulda, shoulda doesn\u2019t matter cause it didn\u2019t happen. Married people don\u2019t share a brain so hearing the other person\u2019s perspective is the key to finding solutions. What will you do next time something happens? Look for solutions not more problems. \n\nHappy you\u2019re feeling better but try not to ignore health concerns in the future.\n\nNTA\n\nETA \u2014 if this is the first time your husband is seeing his family since his Dad passed, it\u2019s not hard to understand why his focus was somewhere else. He\u2019s still an asshole.", "I'm going to go with NAH and prepare to be down voted for it. \n\nWhile yes his dad died 7 months ago, he may not have had the chance to go reminisce and grieve with his family since the passing. While yes, he got absolutely plastered, this isn't a capital offence. \n\n20 weeks is usually enough time before the birth, where being out of touch for a night or two usually isn't a problem, especially with two adults. \n\nIn saying that, you did get hospitalised, however he was in no condition to do anything at that point. With the level of inebriation I would have simply told my SO \"hey, we'll talk tomorrow.\" Rather than getting upset with them for drinking or being about of contact. \n\nI think it was just a high emotional and stressful time for all involved, and both can learn from this in the future by simply saying\n \"Hey, I'm going to go out drinking with my family. I'll text you when I'm home and we'll talk tomorrow. If anything happens call XYZ.\" \n\n#DesignatedSupportPerson\n\n(Coming from a person who had their SO get S faced at a work party when 30 weeks pregnant.

He was the AH for airing all of your business and dragging you like this, your IL are AH for getting involved. In those days you were having contractions did you give him a heads up?

Also, she would have been stressed and sick in the hospital, and he appeared not to care about that.", "Lol pure ignorance especially at the weeks comment", "well things aren\u2019t exactly \u201cfine\u201d, i have to immediately see a doctor once i get home tomorrow because the level my contractions were hitting were close to what they considered risk of preterm labor and they want to put me on a low dose antibiotic after i finish this treatment to prevent this from happening again. i haven\u2019t even gotten to explain that to him yet. but thank you for the opinion!", "If your pregnant partner has to go to hospital, you put down the drink and start making your way. Yes I imagine it was scary, very scary! And you know who OP should have been able to count on in these situations? Her husband, who instead of checking on his pregnant wife who had to get to hospital decided to get more and more shit faced, ignore all her messages, blame her when she\u2019s upset, involve an entire discord chat in this to humiliate her publicly and then run to his family to berate her even more. I understand that he lost his dad 7months ago but he is on track to lose his wife with this behaviour.", "Just because she hasn't lost the baby doesn't mean everything was fine. She has a major UTI which was a hairbreadth away from getting into her kidneys, and was causing contractions. That's actually something that people should be concerned about, and she is going to need monitoring in the near future.\n\nAnd as for getting in touch through his family...did you miss that they were the ones encouraging him to  be out of communication, and trying to guilt trip her?!", "Guy hears his 20 week pregnant wife is going to the ER then gets drunk, ignores her and humiliates her on chat platforms. She needs to change the locks.", "i was in florida for a week with him and his family, but came up here because we rarely get time to visit. and with him not getting much time after his father passed, i told him to stay and spend more time with them.", "Did you miss this part:\n\n> i called my husband and informed him i was going to the ER", "In that case I'd say NTA. Not sure about him, but I hope you can figure it out together.\n\nOh, and get well soon!", "I hear you \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 on him tho", "Oh wow, I am sorry for your loss :( In this case I can understand even more how hard this must be for you to go to the hospital :( I hope that you and the baby are doing well. \n\nI hope you find a way to talk to him again. You are raising a child soon.  Your husband does not seem to be able to handle his emotions. Therapy could help here. By losing his dead and losing one child already, he maybe somehow wanted to ignore the fact that you are in the hospital and that this could be a severe issue again. Not nice, but humans sometimes do strange decision if they are emotionally down.", "Alcohol builds up in the system. He could have been drinking before the call and it just hadn\u2019t processed enough to pickle his brain yet.", "People can seem normal but alcohol is funny like that. I wasn't there, but I think he needs a smidgen of slack, what could he really have done in that moment? \n\nWhen you speak to him, ask him how he was feeling with the news, was he worried about you and a family member kept giving him drinks to calm him down, \nDid he already have a few under his belt, and the next drink just tipped it way over? \nMake plans for the future so.it doesn't happen again. \n\nI know it sucks, I'm sorry you were there by yourself. These things are hard on the daddies too remember. Hope you're feeling better. \ud83e\udec2", "Sober good.", "Did you all miss the fact that she didn't have the baby and that she was released from the hospital, given antibiotics. Was allowed to continue with her vacation and told to follow up with her doctor when she returned home. Having been pregnant myself twice, I am understand a few things about pregnancy. I stand by my opinion she overreacted, and he should have had his phone with him. Maybe she should have been with him visiting his family instead of on separate vacations.", "Ok, that makes sense. .. but I still think counseling is in order. There are obvious communication issues and if he cannot spend time with them without seeing you as the enemy, it does not bode well. You two need to be the force that drives the outside away, and he's not on board. I'm a huge believer in communication in all relationships, and counseling can really help that. And he may also need grief counseling.", "Yup.  Missed that...", "this is reasonable, i just really wish he wouldn\u2019t have handed the phone to his sister and then chose to ignore me for the rest of the night. just made me feel more isolated and alone than i already felt", "that\u2019s definitely a possibility, it\u2019s why i just chose to ignore his behavior until he started with the family group messages and messages to our friends. he was already angry at me on the phone for being upset with him so i just wanted to wait until he was sober", "Honey these people are ignoring two key factors:\n\n1. He chose to emotionally manipulate by texting you on group and online Chats \n\n2. Then he ignored your call and handed you over to his sister to berate. \n\n3. None of this says he cares a fig for you or that baby because he didn't care if you were ok, if his actions caused you stress or anything else. If you'd lost the baby, he wouldn't have known until the next day because he didn't care enough to check on you.", "Totally understand :( So sorry for you. :( :(\nDoes his family know that you've been in the hospital? I would be mad at my brother if he would ignore his wife in such a critical situation.", "That was a smart move. He made some dumb decisions, especially with your being pregnant and being away and the previous history. \n\nHis anger was probably partly at himself. I don\u2019t think any of this is a catastrophic event, and after much cussing and discussing you two will be stronger than ever. \n\nI don\u2019t really see it as you ignoring him, rather just allowing him to come back to the land of sobriety. Had you engaged it might have gotten worse, and the others didn\u2019t need to know your biz. You deescalated the situation by not engaging. Smart move.", "they were aware, the first thing his sister asked was how the baby was so i\u2019m assuming he told them beforehand", "Then I\u2019m gonna say NTA your pregnant, you were bleeding and cramping and nowhere near your due date. Your were scared and needed support, he made it about himself and made himself the victim.", "I wonder what else he told them. :/\n\nI would ask the sister if she can have a call with you because what he wrote in the family chat isn't the truth and you don't want to blame him in front of everybody. So that you would be happy to have a call of her because you are quite confused of his mad behaviour."]}
