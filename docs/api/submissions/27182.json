If your partner is struggling you should do all you reasonably can to support them. \n\nInsisting on an even split of responsibilities when you have free time and you can see your partner is having trouble finding any is pretty insensitive and borderline cruel to me.", "NAH, but get out of this relationship. He wants to do early retirement while you're working yourself into an early grave. If he prioritized your time together he would get more chores done and have dinner ready just so you can enjoy yourselves when you get home from work. But he doesn't care about that. You're not compatible. So just get out.", "NTA and I hope you never have kids with him. You'll have to work and still do half the baby chores and 'your'  house chores... run baby girl, this is a fwb situation not a partnership. You'll end up resenting his laziness in the long run.\nIf he actually loved you he would pick up some of the chores so you could spend more time together.", "NTA. I'm sure if roles would be reversed, he would expect you to do more chores. Relationship is teamwork. He doesn't work, but why can't he do more in the house? Even just to help you more out because you work, come home and still has to do chores? If nothing changes, just break up, he clearly doesn't see this as relationship", "NTA for asking, and NTA for feeling hurt by his refusal to renegotiate chores.\n\nHe's allowed to say \"no\" to your request. You're allowed to be upset that your bf is refusing to put some of his time and energy (which he has more of than you at the moment) into helping you when you're overwhelmed.", "NTA. If I was planning an early retirement and had a long term partner that I wanted to spend my future with, I\u2019d be working towards us both being able to retire early cause what\u2019s the point otherwise?

They should take a bigger role when it comes to chores.\n\nLike, if someone is a homewife/husband, their work is to take care of the home (kids and house/apartment). \n\nIt should all be considered teamwork!\n\nIf he doesn't want to be ok your team, then he should piss off. You deserve someone better in that case.\n\nNot the AH", "NAH. He can say no to increasing his chores, you can feel under pressure from yours and ask for help from your partner. Maybe you could consider reshuffling the jobs instead to suit your schedules. If you usually cook dinner, maybe he could cook dinner since he\u2019s not rushing home from work and you could take one of his less time sensitive jobs, like maybe the hoovering. If you\u2019ve got no kids, other than cooking, dishes, bins and laundry there shouldn\u2019t be much to create additional pressure. Everything else can wait for days off.

Okay so he doesn't need an income but he's not doing anything productive, not challenging himself, has no goals, not growing as a person.  If this is a temporary rest, okay, but if he's checked out at 27, plans to spend his life playing video games and hanging out I would think seriously about what you're signing up for.", "NTA, you are a roommate with benefits.  At his age he is not retired.  Investments can go south. Just because he is getting a good return today does not mean he will in a few months. What if he gets sick?

It's the nice thing to do to help out the people you care about.", "NTA, when myself & my wife worked we shared the chores, there was then a period where I was not working & she was where I took over 90% of the chores, she has since retired & we share the chores again.  \n\n\nI would simply just do half the chores (those that impact you most), see if he complains tell him to do them himself or pay someone to come in & do them", "I'm kinda torn? But your situation is more like a FWB. If he was your boyfriend/partner he wouldn't want to see you this exhausted and overwhelmed. He does not seem to care about your wellbeing as long as you everything is \"divided\".

You're asking for a favor and he's free to say no. You being upset with him for not being willing to alter the agreement is unfair.\n\nHave you offered something in trade to make up for him taking on more responsibilities?

You guys are still roommates, not partners.\n\nI don't think he will change his views about you. Maybe hiring a cleaner could work short term, but long term I don't think you guys can make it work", "NTA.. this is the difference between a boyfriend and a partner.  A partner would want to lessen the load and equalize the circumstances. \n\nTime to look ahead to your future", "This right here is why I don't understand couples who don't share finances. If you two stay together long term, what does that look like? He continues to have his retirement while you work a full time job? He gets to have a nice relaxing life while you work a full time job trying to make ends meet? Because if 2 years into a relationship he's unwilling to do any extra work, despite clearly having the time available to easily do so, then its hard to imagine he's suddenly going to change that position further down the line.", "Sounds like you are roommates and not living partners. Sounds very transactional. NTA", "INFO\n\nAre the chores actually split evenly? Does he do half the household work?\n\nBecause he has a point if so. He worked, he saved, he's managed to set himself up for this. You have made different choices. Nothing wrong with asking for a favor but if he says no and is actually pulling his weight financially and with the chores...\n\nThis isn't a stay at home parent thing where he's being supported if that's the case. This is him still pulling his financial weight and his chore weight. Partnered with someone who chose not to do the same kind of saving or didn't have the income. Someone who now wants the benefits of his hard work to bleed over in to their life without having done that work themselves.", "NTA - Sure technically he is contributing half to the household. But relationships aren't built on technicalities, and you should want to help a partner instead of watching them drown.\n\nI don't understand why he can't cook you dinner, he eats too doesn't he? It wouldn't add much for him but would make a big difference to you at the end of a work day. He could also chuck your laundry on during the day, hang it up and leave it to you to iron. Only a little extra for him, still leaves the bulk for you to do, but would make it that bit easier.", "YTA\n\nBecause he has been successful, he has to cover your chores? Hard no. You are not married, you do not have shared finances, and even if you were, he is putting in 50% of the time, money and effort in your relationship so is not obliged to do more. It is a reasonable thing to be supportive to help a loved one through a bad patch. But you aren't ill, this is not a short term situation, what you are suggesting is that he be your domestic help because you don't want to pull your own weight.", "NAH sounds like you're not compatible.\n\nHe found a way to pay his bills and do his half, but I also wouldn't want to be the working partner while my other half is at home all day doing nothing. I like to be in a relationship with someone who works. Sounds like you found out you don't have the same work ethic.\n\nI think I'm being really generous here, but I had the exact same experience in my 20s. I learned from that I need a relationship with someone who also enjoys working. You won't change him and he doesn't think he's doing anything wrong so if it doesn't suit you, you're best off leaving.", "NAH. \n\nYou two opted for an egalitarian relationship where things are 50/50. This worked out but it\u2019s a glimpse in what will happen in the future.\n\nWhat if you get an injury and you\u2019re unable to do chores? Will he help? Or will he be like - you fell down the stairs; it\u2019s your fault? Same goes the other way; if he\u2019s injured will you pick up his chores?\n\nMaybe another solution is to stop doing any unnecessary chores (other than take out your trash, do your laundry) and take a step back while you\u2019re focused on work. Like if you do his laundry- full stop because it\u2019s 50/50. Also are there any chores you can outsource - like instead of shopping somewhere in person, do a grocery pick up to cut back on time. Maybe even skip cooking every night and opt for meal prep or something easy like pick up your own dinner (since he\u2019s so 50/50 about the partnership).", "I've no idea why this one is so divisive. Obviously you're NTA. Contributing to a household is measured in time and effort, not just money. If I was lucky (or privileged) enough to retire early, I wouldn't want to laze around all day while my hypothetical wife got no free time - I'd at the very least take on the housework so that we could enjoy her free time together. This man values playing an extra hour of video games over your wellbeing and quality time with you. Which I think is selfish, but I suppose it's his right. It sounds like you need to be with someone a bit less transactional though, who actually sees the relationship as a partnership.", "You asked, he said no. Your agreement is fair as it is, he is within his rights to say no.", "NAH\n\nYou're allowed to ask, he's allowed to say no. I'd say you would be an asshole if you kept pushing the subject onto him. No is a complete sentence and he is still doing his share of expenses and chores.", "NAH but that man does not like you.", "You are just a roommate he has sex with. NTA", "YTA He made it and should not be punished for success. Solution: get a cleaning lady or whatever and pay for it together.", "well it ks your right to ask, it is not your right to 'push' anything on him. soft YTA, if chores are so bad start looking into a cleaning agency or smthng, do not bother your bf because you think he has it easier.", "ESH. You aren\u2019t an AH for asking; but he\u2019s not the AH for refusing. These are agreed upon terms of your relationship. The level of tit-for-tat is pretty limiting for a relationship going anywhere. You can always insist upon changing the terms. That just may result in finding a new roommate. Which leaves room in your life to find a more generous and loving relationship.", "NTA, but there's a middle ground here. He's probably worried because he thinks you'll dump the household on him and he won't be able to enjoy his well earned time the way he sees fit.\n\nYou should explain that this is temporary because of work or w/e it is and he'll be helping you personally, then things will go back to normal.", "YTA. He sorted his financials - he has chosen how he wants to spend his time. As long as he is not making more work/chores, you haven't got any right to ask for him to take more chores \"just because he's home more\". \n\nThat being said, my judgement is based on your relationship agreement. If you don't want a partner who treats you like this you'll have to make the hard call.", "Is he wealthy enough now that he could support you guys on just his income? If so and he\u2019s not even willing to let you cut down on hours so you could have more time together, he\u2019s not a great person.

Yeah sure hes providing money but that\u2019s not a partnership. If you\u2019re in a long term relationship wouldn\u2019t you want to have more time together and a less exhausted spouse? It would 100% breed resentment regardless of the gender. It seems like you\u2019re still just roommates with sex. Your normal day would be work 8hrs, come home, cook clean etc, while he does 1hr chores and nothing the rest of the day. In terms of daily effort yours is 90% to his 10%. You asked if he could maybe pick up a few of yours to ease the pressure and he refuses. You never asked him to take over all of your chores, just to help. \n\nI don\u2019t think this relationship is going to work, he will happily let you do more daily and live his early retirement. He would have to pay someone to do your share if you left and I think he\u2019s quite happy with that. I mean I guess that\u2019s his choice but I wouldn\u2019t be with someone like that, regardless of what money they had. \n\nNTA \n\nIs this the relationship you want to be in? Where you struggle daily but because he provides money (not even more money than you to the household) he doesn\u2019t want to help? He thinks that because he puts equal money that he doesn\u2019t have to provide equal effort. Wouldn\u2019t you rather be with someone that wants you to be happy? To not struggle daily?

My husband makes more than me, we both work but if he was able to retire early I know for a fact he would make sure that my working day would be easier as he would be at home, that I would come home to a clean place and if i was really struggling we\u2019d work together to find a solution.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nHe's covering his bills and doing his chores.
