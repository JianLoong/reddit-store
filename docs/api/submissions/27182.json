For the first year we were just roommates and then we started dating each other. Since we started as roomates we never changed the chores and financal distribution everything is equal.\n\n6 months ago he quit his job as he has investments with returns that cover all of his expenses and more. At first I didn't think anything of it he just called it an early retirement. He is always home playing video games or doing something around the house or going out. Now he does do his portion of the chores but considering he has so much time now, I asked if he can maybe take over a few of my chores. I asked this because lately I am overwhelmed with work and then come home and cook for myself and do some chores. \n\nBut he refused and said \"we have everything split equally now if I couldn't handle my share of the bill I would have definitely compensated that by handling majority if not all the chores. But considering I do contribute equally I don't want to take on more work.\" I tried to argue but to it had no effect. I was really upset and he could feel it because he did come to me and tried to make up but refused to contribute more and is now upset that I am expecting something that he just doesn't want to or even have to do. And that I am being a dick by pushing the subject.\n\n\nEdit 1: I was not able to reply to many comments but thank you all for giving your opinions. Adding a few details which I saw people asking.\n\n1. He is able to retire now because he has been working towards it since he was like 15 or 16. He was very frugal about spending money on himself. Sacrificed almost everything a young person experiences like going out, parties, even friends(he has like 2 to 3) and sleep. His target was to retire at 30 but he got a little lucky(his words).\n\n2. I didn't propose this as a temporary change because. I got worried that he might become lazy. Please note he is not a lazy person by any means. But I thought that not doing anything productive could become detrimental to his well being and it would also lighten my share at work so we can spend even more time. Which I now agree is a bit selfish of me.\n\n3. Many people have also said that he doesn't seem to care about me. And I agree that it may feel that way from the post but he has taken care of me whenever I was ill and if I ask if he could handle things at home for a day or two he does that without any complaints. He just doesn't want to change the whole dynamic.", "created_utc": 1695105979, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mjr4m/aita_for_asking_my_bf_to_do_more_chores_around/", "score": 592, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your partner is struggling you should do all you reasonably can to support them. \n\nInsisting on an even split of responsibilities when you have free time and you can see your partner is having trouble finding any is pretty insensitive and borderline cruel to me.", "NAH, but get out of this relationship. He wants to do early retirement while you're working yourself into an early grave. If he prioritized your time together he would get more chores done and have dinner ready just so you can enjoy yourselves when you get home from work. But he doesn't care about that. You're not compatible. So just get out.", "NTA and I hope you never have kids with him. You'll have to work and still do half the baby chores and 'your'  house chores... run baby girl, this is a fwb situation not a partnership. You'll end up resenting his laziness in the long run.\nIf he actually loved you he would pick up some of the chores so you could spend more time together.", "NTA. I'm sure if roles would be reversed, he would expect you to do more chores. Relationship is teamwork. He doesn't work, but why can't he do more in the house? Even just to help you more out because you work, come home and still has to do chores? If nothing changes, just break up, he clearly doesn't see this as relationship", "NTA for asking, and NTA for feeling hurt by his refusal to renegotiate chores.\n\nHe's allowed to say \"no\" to your request. You're allowed to be upset that your bf is refusing to put some of his time and energy (which he has more of than you at the moment) into helping you when you're overwhelmed.", "NTA. If I was planning an early retirement and had a long term partner that I wanted to spend my future with, I\u2019d be working towards us both being able to retire early cause what\u2019s the point otherwise? At a minimum if I had more free time and they weee struggling with work I\u2019d take over more chore to help take the load off them.

He may have said otherwise verbally but his actions say it all.", "Being roomates, the chores and costs should be as equal as possible. However, when romantically involved, it should instead be divided fairly. I mean if one earns more, they should put in more to pay the bills. And yhe same should apply for chores.

They should take a bigger role when it comes to chores.\n\nLike, if someone is a homewife/husband, their work is to take care of the home (kids and house/apartment). \n\nIt should all be considered teamwork!\n\nIf he doesn't want to be ok your team, then he should piss off. You deserve someone better in that case.\n\nNot the AH", "NAH. He can say no to increasing his chores, you can feel under pressure from yours and ask for help from your partner. Maybe you could consider reshuffling the jobs instead to suit your schedules. If you usually cook dinner, maybe he could cook dinner since he\u2019s not rushing home from work and you could take one of his less time sensitive jobs, like maybe the hoovering. If you\u2019ve got no kids, other than cooking, dishes, bins and laundry there shouldn\u2019t be much to create additional pressure. Everything else can wait for days off.

Maybe you could go in together on a couple hours of a cleaner each week.", "NTA\n\nIdk why, but he's treating the relationship like a transaction, not a romantic partnership", "I think it goes deeper than equity. Okay so he doesn't need an income but he's not doing anything productive, not challenging himself, has no goals, not growing as a person.  If this is a temporary rest, okay, but if he's checked out at 27, plans to spend his life playing video games and hanging out I would think seriously about what you're signing up for.", "NTA, you are a roommate with benefits.  At his age he is not retired.  Investments can go south. Just because he is getting a good return today does not mean he will in a few months. What if he gets sick?  Will he have to sell off a few investments, tape out the returns.  Best if you start looking for your own place.", "Nta but ywbta if you push it.  There's no need for a fight over it.\n\nThat said you would not be the asshole if you broke up over this. It's obvious that you are seen as a casual girlfriend rather than a partner.", "NTA.", "NTA - its normal to take on more if your partner is struggling and you have the free time. he\u2019ll still have a lot of free time if he takes some more time to do some of \u2018your\u2019 stuff around the house.", "NTA, find someone who is an equal match in more than earnings.  Your distribution-of-chores system was set up for two working people to share. If you're planning on staying together, it's time to renegotiate.", "NTA/YWBTA (if you pushed it, he's been clear) - He doesn't have to say yes, but I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone who was unwilling to help me out if I was feeling overwhelmed. It wouldn't make me feel like they liked or cared about me very much. It's the nice thing to do to help out the people you care about.", "NTA, when myself & my wife worked we shared the chores, there was then a period where I was not working & she was where I took over 90% of the chores, she has since retired & we share the chores again.  \n\n\nI would simply just do half the chores (those that impact you most), see if he complains tell him to do them himself or pay someone to come in & do them", "I'm kinda torn? But your situation is more like a FWB. If he was your boyfriend/partner he wouldn't want to see you this exhausted and overwhelmed. He does not seem to care about your wellbeing as long as you everything is \"divided\". What happens if you guys have kids? \n\nHe is not a kind of partner I personally wanted to spend my future with.\n\nNta", "I'd say he's right in that he's still contributing everything he originally agreed to. You're asking for a favor and he's free to say no. You being upset with him for not being willing to alter the agreement is unfair.\n\nHave you offered something in trade to make up for him taking on more responsibilities? What about hiring a service to do your part of the chores?", "OP, if you approached this as \"I'm stressed at work and honestly overwhelmed, can you please help me out by temporarily taking on more of the housework until this project at work finishes in two weeks?\" you would'd be N T A, but that's not what your post describes. YTA.\n\nAnyone wonder what the average judgement would be if an entitled man wanted his wife that covered half of the expenses to be a proper housewife on top?", "I think we need to take responsibility for our own messes. \n\nI guess my question would be\u2026 what are \u201cyour chores.\u201d", "NTA, but this is not an equal relationship. You guys are still roommates, not partners.\n\nI don't think he will change his views about you. Maybe hiring a cleaner could work short term, but long term I don't think you guys can make it work", "NTA.. this is the difference between a boyfriend and a partner.  A partner would want to lessen the load and equalize the circumstances. \n\nTime to look ahead to your future", "This right here is why I don't understand couples who don't share finances. If you two stay together long term, what does that look like? He continues to have his retirement while you work a full time job? He gets to have a nice relaxing life while you work a full time job trying to make ends meet? Because if 2 years into a relationship he's unwilling to do any extra work, despite clearly having the time available to easily do so, then its hard to imagine he's suddenly going to change that position further down the line.", "Sounds like you are roommates and not living partners. Sounds very transactional. NTA", "INFO\n\nAre the chores actually split evenly? Does he do half the household work?\n\nBecause he has a point if so. He worked, he saved, he's managed to set himself up for this. You have made different choices. Nothing wrong with asking for a favor but if he says no and is actually pulling his weight financially and with the chores...\n\nThis isn't a stay at home parent thing where he's being supported if that's the case. This is him still pulling his financial weight and his chore weight. Partnered with someone who chose not to do the same kind of saving or didn't have the income. Someone who now wants the benefits of his hard work to bleed over in to their life without having done that work themselves.", "NTA - Sure technically he is contributing half to the household. But relationships aren't built on technicalities, and you should want to help a partner instead of watching them drown.\n\nI don't understand why he can't cook you dinner, he eats too doesn't he? It wouldn't add much for him but would make a big difference to you at the end of a work day. He could also chuck your laundry on during the day, hang it up and leave it to you to iron. Only a little extra for him, still leaves the bulk for you to do, but would make it that bit easier.", "YTA\n\nBecause he has been successful, he has to cover your chores? Hard no. You are not married, you do not have shared finances, and even if you were, he is putting in 50% of the time, money and effort in your relationship so is not obliged to do more. It is a reasonable thing to be supportive to help a loved one through a bad patch. But you aren't ill, this is not a short term situation, what you are suggesting is that he be your domestic help because you don't want to pull your own weight.", "NAH sounds like you're not compatible.\n\nHe found a way to pay his bills and do his half, but I also wouldn't want to be the working partner while my other half is at home all day doing nothing. I like to be in a relationship with someone who works. Sounds like you found out you don't have the same work ethic.\n\nI think I'm being really generous here, but I had the exact same experience in my 20s. I learned from that I need a relationship with someone who also enjoys working. You won't change him and he doesn't think he's doing anything wrong so if it doesn't suit you, you're best off leaving.", "NAH. \n\nYou two opted for an egalitarian relationship where things are 50/50. This worked out but it\u2019s a glimpse in what will happen in the future.\n\nWhat if you get an injury and you\u2019re unable to do chores? Will he help? Or will he be like - you fell down the stairs; it\u2019s your fault? Same goes the other way; if he\u2019s injured will you pick up his chores?\n\nMaybe another solution is to stop doing any unnecessary chores (other than take out your trash, do your laundry) and take a step back while you\u2019re focused on work. Like if you do his laundry- full stop because it\u2019s 50/50. Also are there any chores you can outsource - like instead of shopping somewhere in person, do a grocery pick up to cut back on time. Maybe even skip cooking every night and opt for meal prep or something easy like pick up your own dinner (since he\u2019s so 50/50 about the partnership).", "I've no idea why this one is so divisive. Obviously you're NTA. Contributing to a household is measured in time and effort, not just money. If I was lucky (or privileged) enough to retire early, I wouldn't want to laze around all day while my hypothetical wife got no free time - I'd at the very least take on the housework so that we could enjoy her free time together. This man values playing an extra hour of video games over your wellbeing and quality time with you. Which I think is selfish, but I suppose it's his right. It sounds like you need to be with someone a bit less transactional though, who actually sees the relationship as a partnership.", "You asked, he said no. Your agreement is fair as it is, he is within his rights to say no.", "NAH\n\nYou're allowed to ask, he's allowed to say no. I'd say you would be an asshole if you kept pushing the subject onto him. No is a complete sentence and he is still doing his share of expenses and chores.", "NAH but that man does not like you.", "You are just a roommate he has sex with. NTA", "YTA He made it and should not be punished for success. Solution: get a cleaning lady or whatever and pay for it together.", "well it ks your right to ask, it is not your right to 'push' anything on him. soft YTA, if chores are so bad start looking into a cleaning agency or smthng, do not bother your bf because you think he has it easier.", "ESH. You aren\u2019t an AH for asking; but he\u2019s not the AH for refusing. These are agreed upon terms of your relationship. The level of tit-for-tat is pretty limiting for a relationship going anywhere. You can always insist upon changing the terms. That just may result in finding a new roommate. Which leaves room in your life to find a more generous and loving relationship.", "NTA, but there's a middle ground here. He's probably worried because he thinks you'll dump the household on him and he won't be able to enjoy his well earned time the way he sees fit.\n\nYou should explain that this is temporary because of work or w/e it is and he'll be helping you personally, then things will go back to normal.", "YTA. He sorted his financials - he has chosen how he wants to spend his time. As long as he is not making more work/chores, you haven't got any right to ask for him to take more chores \"just because he's home more\". \n\nThat being said, my judgement is based on your relationship agreement. If you don't want a partner who treats you like this you'll have to make the hard call.", "Is he wealthy enough now that he could support you guys on just his income? If so and he\u2019s not even willing to let you cut down on hours so you could have more time together, he\u2019s not a great person. He just wants his own free time and doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re miserable.", "INFO: are you willing to pay more of the bills?", "I don\u2019t understand why anyone would be happy to watch their partner struggle and have the \u201cwell I\u2019ve got my money\u201d attitude. Yeah sure hes providing money but that\u2019s not a partnership. If you\u2019re in a long term relationship wouldn\u2019t you want to have more time together and a less exhausted spouse? It would 100% breed resentment regardless of the gender. It seems like you\u2019re still just roommates with sex. Your normal day would be work 8hrs, come home, cook clean etc, while he does 1hr chores and nothing the rest of the day. In terms of daily effort yours is 90% to his 10%. You asked if he could maybe pick up a few of yours to ease the pressure and he refuses. You never asked him to take over all of your chores, just to help. \n\nI don\u2019t think this relationship is going to work, he will happily let you do more daily and live his early retirement. He would have to pay someone to do your share if you left and I think he\u2019s quite happy with that. I mean I guess that\u2019s his choice but I wouldn\u2019t be with someone like that, regardless of what money they had. \n\nNTA \n\nIs this the relationship you want to be in? Where you struggle daily but because he provides money (not even more money than you to the household) he doesn\u2019t want to help? He thinks that because he puts equal money that he doesn\u2019t have to provide equal effort. Wouldn\u2019t you rather be with someone that wants you to be happy? To not struggle daily? I just wouldn\u2019t want to live in that kind of imbalance. My husband makes more than me, we both work but if he was able to retire early I know for a fact he would make sure that my working day would be easier as he would be at home, that I would come home to a clean place and if i was really struggling we\u2019d work together to find a solution.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nHe's covering his bills and doing his chores.

You're acting like a shitty employer. Why do you think he decided to retire?\n\n>it would also lighten my share at work so we can spend even more time\n\nThis is back on track.

You aren't an asshole for wanting him to support you when you're overworked when it's so possible, but he's contributing equally so can't be called an asshole. He doesn't care that your stressed and overworked, though. It shows that he's not all that concerned with your wellbeing and feels no need to to support you in any way that puts him out at all.

Meaning one person pays 80%, the other 20% because that's what they can afford.  Which I guess supposed to be equal... some how.

She resents him for making it to his goal and having the thing he bought... because that's what his time is right now. He bought it back from the system. And she now wants it.

My granddad basically became my grandma's sous chef when he retired.

Now that my mom's retired before my dad, she does more around the house than she used to. \n\nAlthough honestly, based how OP described how her bf came to be retired before 30 (sacrificing a social life, etc.), it wouldn't surprise me too much if their relationship was more convenient for him than anything else since they were already roommates before they got together.
