{"id": 5248, "submission_id": "zr55br", "title": "AITA for not wanting to continue supporting my daughter's (12F) gymnastics training", "selftext": "When my daughter was young, we introduced her to gymnastics.  She was totally hooked and kept asking for more and more lessons. We encouraged her, thinking she will eventually lose interest. Now she is 12, training 20 hours a week, spending weekends after weekends competing at high level competitions.\n\nProblem is, she is 5'7 already and still growing. She is starting to have ambition for D1 scholarship, or even Olympics. That makes me very worried. Being 5'7 basically kills her chance of going to the Olympics. D1 gymnastics scholarship is already rare, the odds of her getting one with her height is even more rare.\n\nIt makes me feel bad that our daughter is very, very dedicated. She's almost always the first one at the gym and the last one to leave. She watches replays of her routine on our drive to training, turns down social events because she \"needs to train\", does extra conditioning at home.\n\nYet I cannot justify blowing thousands of dollars a year and hundreds of hours in time every year to gamble on something with so little chance of success. All the hours spent at her training, driving her to competition is already causing our family life to suffer.  She under-rotates her skills because of her height, and gets injured more frequently than others.  Her academics are suffering because of her gymnastics commitment.  Her life is going in the wrong direction because of gymnastics.  The bandaid is better ripped off earlier than later.  My husband agrees.\n\nI broke the news to my daughter. Frankly, it breaks my heart to tell her to give up something she has worked so hard for. I told her I know she is a hard worker. She would get much better reward if she channels her hard work elsewhere, like in school, or another sport. Hell, she plays tennis with the family only casually, yet she was able to win a few u12 tournaments locally. If that's not talent, I don't know what is!\n\nNeedless to say, she did not take that well. She cried and cried and cried, locking herself in her room, refusing to eat, saying maybe if she doesn't eat, she will become shorter. I told her over and over that I love her, and I just want the best for her, but she wouldn't have any of it. I tried to reason with her - telling her chasing a \"dream\" is a privilege, not a right.  No use!  My husband has now softened even though we used to have an agreement. Our family is now phoning us to try to persuade us to let her continue training, even offering support for training cost and pickup / drop-offs.\n\nIf she has the right body type to be an elite gymnast, or if she is tall like she is, but is not struggling because of her height, I would support her unconditionally. However that is not the case! Sometimes I feel like giving in, but to think it through, I was the person who drove her to training and competition, I am the breadwinner who paid for her training.  It should be my right to call it off, especially as a parent.\n\nHelp me out reddit.

Mom of D1 scholarship athlete. The most important thing you wrote is your daughter is getting injured. Truly, that should be it. Gymnastics is very hard on your body even if you don\u2019t have specific injuries. The daily wear and tear means a 18 yo is barely able to make it through 4 years of competition. Watch a few NCAA meets. A few schools look like their athletes are put together with duct tape. If your daughter has injuries like a sprained ankle or a pulled hamstring at 12, it will never fully heal. Gymnastics is 20 hours a week, 51 weeks a year. Then there are the really scary injuries that start to happen around growth spurts, typically puberty. Concussions, herniated discs, broken everything - feet, elbows, hands. Sometimes worse. \n\nThat being said, there are sports that transition nicely from gymnastics. One of the girls from our gym had chronic back pain and finally quit in 10th grade. She picked up diving, D1 scholarship, SEC rookie of the year in her sport. Another girl who broke her elbow ended up in pole vaulting and competes in college. My youngest did everything; gymnastics, theater, lax, poly sci club. She is playing a sport at the club level in college. There are girls on her team who never played before and they have a blast. \n\nYes, your daughter might hate you now but you will never forgive yourself if she ends up unable to do basic things like jogging, or hiking or even going on rides at Disney World because her passion is somehow more important than her health.", "What do her coaches say?

I still regret that decision years on, and it was MY decision, not my parents\u2019. I cannot imagine the resentment she will feel towards you for taking away what she really, really wants. Her hunger strike is her way of communicating to you, at 12 years old, what this means to her. Perhaps she doesn\u2019t value the socialising in the same way as you. That isn\u2019t how she wants to spend her time. \n\nI\u2019ll also add, I am also 5,7. Though, yes I am a male gymnast, I do not under-rotate my skills or have an increased risk of injury because of my height. 5,7 is a brilliant height for a gymnast. And she is only 12, she may be under-rotating now because she has grown taller, but the muscle development isn\u2019t quite there for the height. In time, and with conditioning, it will and she will stop under-rotating. It could also be her technique that is preventing her getting around. Don\u2019t be so quick to blame it on her height. Perhaps she isn\u2019t setting for her skills enough. That\u2019s another issue. \n\nI also think it\u2019s ridiculous to state that her chances of making it in tennis are higher than in gymnastics, because she has won some local tournaments. Look at the facts! She\u2019s already a national level gymnast aged 12. I know that path. I know what it\u2019s like to train 20+ hours per week. To suddenly switch that for another sport...besides, if money is an issue - stay away from tennis! Coincidentally, tennis is also my other sport. It\u2019s more costly than gymnastics. \n\nI would say you are in the right as her parent to call it all off. But I would say you are the asshole I\u2019m not giving your daughter a say, or the chance to voice her concern before you made your decision. I\u2019d also say you should speak to her coach(es) about the prospects of her making it to the top. A good coach won\u2019t lie. When I stopped competing, I had coaches from other clubs reach out to tell me I was making a mistake. That showed the reality of my potential. See what the coaches have to say. \n\nI\u2019d also like to add that gymnastics isn\u2019t so strict as it used to be. Your daughter could specialise in one of the four women\u2019s pieces (assuming you\u2019re talking artistic gymnastics). Floor, Beam, Vault, Bars - she doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be an all around champion. If you want to hone her into her strengths, for example let\u2019s say it is Beam, then see with the coaches if she is/will be able to specialise there. That would potentially require fewer training hours than an all around gymnast. Seeing as she is 12, I doubt they\u2019d let her specialise so young. They\u2019ll probably want to cover all 4 for a few more years before they really allow any specialisation. That was my mistake, I stopped before I was allowed to specialise (floor and vault for me!). \n\nSpeak with your daughter and her coach to see if specialising is an option. Yes you have paid for her training so far, and technically it is your right, however by paying for her up to such a high level, you have implied to her that you would support her in her journey. This is her journey. She\u2019s on board the long term. You can\u2019t really just cut it, even if you can. You will pay in another way of you do not manage this scenario in the way that is fair in your daughter\u2019s eyes.

I tried other sports during seasons when there was nowhere to do the one I enjoy and it kept me active but was never really the same; I always made it back to what I enjoy. It gives me an outlet and keeps me in shape. So you're not just 'investing' in the possibility of going pro, you are allowing your child to have a passion and live it out.

It was a great way to keep in shape, and kept me connected to my friends and a place that felt like home. It was also a lot less hours so I took up fencing and horseback riding in my newfound free time. \n\n\nI then kept coaching for 7 years and traveled in the summer to some expensive boarding style summer camps to teach it as a head coach. \n\n\nAlso while she probably won't go to the Olympics university gymnastics had some decent scholarships and they really don't care the same way about height or body type. So she could have a future in gymnastics that could pay for university, if she wants to continue it. \n\n\nAnother way to approach cutting down on gymnastics is to add in other classes like dance and ballet, which will help the gymnastics as well as strengthen muscles that will help her not get hurt as often.

I loved it, too.  And I would have done anything to go elite... until I suffered a catastrophic injury. I'm lucky and was able to heal from it completely.

Parents are supposed to support your children\u2019s passions, but if that means they break their bodies and develop life long injuries, then it\u2019s a no for me dawg.

There are many ways to make a living with gymnastics.  Even without the Olympics there is still the pro circuit.  But the biggest is stunt work for film and TV.  I know quite a few people who make money doing stunt work that had a background in gymnastics.  And they are people of all sizes. I don\u2019t see how you can say NAH when parent said it\u2019s not worth investing in daughters passion because she is too tall for the Olympics.  OP said that if daughter had the right body type they would still support it, so for OP it\u2019s not about daughters skill.  They just don\u2019t like their daughter sticking out from other gymnasts, even if she is better.  It all about image for OP.  I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t have parents like that when I grew up.  I had parents who encouraged me to do things I loved.  They paid for acting classes and stuff when I was a kid even though they knew I wouldn\u2019t be an Oscar winning actor.  They paid for soccer training and traveling to tournaments even knowing I wouldn\u2019t be a World Cup player. They did what they could to support me, and I think it\u2019s wrong to only see investing in a child passion for a physical return like an Olympic medal.  And honestly if I hadn\u2019t been in a bad car accident at 13, I probably would have kept on with the soccer as long as I could have.", "It's a YTA for me because of **how** OP is handling it & how much of her repeated focus is on the money she's put into it (that won't pay off).\n\nYes, someone needed to step in & gently talk to her, but that's not what OP did or is trying to do.", "I\u2019m a former tall gymnast, and I say YTA so hard.\n\nParents regularly spend thousands of dollars on hobbies for their kids. They almost never, ever, EVER go pro witu those hobbies. Hundreds of soccer moms spend thousands on lessons and hours taking kids to matches in the full knowledge that they will never go pro.\n\nThere are also a lot of things that gymnastics training can give you. Maybe your daughter will try competitive cheerleading \u2014 there\u2019s scholarships for that. Maybe she\u2019ll get into dance. Or diving. Maybe she\u2019ll get the acting bug and use her skills for stunt work. Or personal training. Or acrobatics, or cirque du soleil, or broadway, or aerials. There are so many ways to make a career or hobby in this without being *an Olympian* holy shit.\n\nMaybe her gymnastics will help make her a well-rounded college candidate so she\u2019ll get a scholarship anyway, even if it isn\u2019t a scholarship *for* gymnastics. Maybe she won\u2019t do anything but get a huge sense of pride and accomplishment.\n\nPersonally? It made me great at yoga \u2014 which I enjoy for my mental health \u2014 and climbing, which I also do because it\u2019s fun.\n\nRight now, you\u2019re teaching your daughter that the only reason to do something is if you\u2019re going to make it your life or go pro. That\u2019s so, so stupid. Don\u2019t teach your daughter to give up on something she loves just cos she isn\u2019t in the top 1%. Being in the top 10% is fine. Being in the top 95% is fine. As long as she loves it and she\u2019s happy and healthy, it\u2019s OK. This attitude is setting her up for serious inferiority issues in the future.\n\nYTA for another reason, too, though: it\u2019s clear your daughter\u2019s relationship with the sport is unhealthy. She needs a social life outside of gymnastics. She needs to eat healthily (and forced perfectionism from my parents played a big role in my own disordered eating.) She needs to take breaks so she doesn\u2019t get injured. Your daughter is literally starving herself in a desire to be perfect. Taking this sport away will just punish her for not being perfect. She needs therapy, and a change of pace, and *the knowledge that you will love and support her in her hobbies even as she gets taller and less competitive.*\n\nTHIS is how body dysmorphia happens. I recommend both individual and family therapy.\n\nYou should have been enforcing those boundaries all along. You don\u2019t get to suddenly take away your child\u2019s entire life just because you realized now that you failed earlier. \n\nYou can start enforcing boundaries now, even though it\u2019s going to be hard. You can start to teach her to have a healthy relationship with her body and with her sport of choice. You can teach her it\u2019s OK to love yourself, your hobbies, your skills, and your body without needing 100% perfection.\n\nYou are the cause of your daughter\u2019s struggles. Not gymnastics.

At age 24\u2026 OP is not taking the right approach by any means, but if there\u2019s a way to prevent a life like this for her daughter she should push her to still partake in her passion but in a safer manner (assuming her height would lead to injuries, I have no idea about gymnastics lol)", "As a former gymnast, agreed.

You could have limited her to recreation at an early age, but I bet you were caught up in her doing well in competitions.

If she is frequently hurting herself while trying to push her limits, I fully agree with that stance.\n\nEven Simone Biles, ***widely considered the best female gymnast the world has seen***, has stopped herself from continuing because of safety concerns. **She literally pulled out of the Olympics because she had the twisties and wasn\u2019t confident in her ability to orient herself as she moved through the air**.

I look at it as similar to the increasing numbers of parents not wanting their kids to play American football because of the significant concussion risks - it sucks if the kid wants to play the sport, but if there are real risks to their safety by letting them play, I can't blame a parent for saying no to that", "What did you major in?", "How do you know it will only be a hobby at best?

Listen to your daughter, allow her to express exactly what gymnastics means to her, and in turn explain your concerns. Then, together, discuss how to move forward in a way that doesn't force daughter to give up her passion, but also expands her horizons. Come to a decision on how much time she should be spending on her grades, how much time she's with friends. Hell, do some research together on what's healthy for her age on all of those points. Help her see where you're coming from, and please try harder to see her side too.

There was no expectation I\u2019d be professional, though there was hope for a scholarship.

But 99.99% will end up with injuries, interrupted or poor educations etc and no medals or full ride scholarships. \n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think ROI in the form of medals etc should be required for kids to do sports, but realistic expectations and considering finances/potential harm to child\u2019s development (30 hours of training a week is pretty normal for elite track kids. 30 hours is 3/4 of a full time job.

My cousins had the same deal in their family and that way everyone got to follow their passions without resentment building.
