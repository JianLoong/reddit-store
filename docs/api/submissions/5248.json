{"id": 5248, "submission_id": "zr55br", "title": "AITA for not wanting to continue supporting my daughter's (12F) gymnastics training", "selftext": "When my daughter was young, we introduced her to gymnastics.  She was totally hooked and kept asking for more and more lessons. We encouraged her, thinking she will eventually lose interest. Now she is 12, training 20 hours a week, spending weekends after weekends competing at high level competitions.\n\nProblem is, she is 5'7 already and still growing. She is starting to have ambition for D1 scholarship, or even Olympics. That makes me very worried. Being 5'7 basically kills her chance of going to the Olympics. D1 gymnastics scholarship is already rare, the odds of her getting one with her height is even more rare.\n\nIt makes me feel bad that our daughter is very, very dedicated. She's almost always the first one at the gym and the last one to leave. She watches replays of her routine on our drive to training, turns down social events because she \"needs to train\", does extra conditioning at home.\n\nYet I cannot justify blowing thousands of dollars a year and hundreds of hours in time every year to gamble on something with so little chance of success. All the hours spent at her training, driving her to competition is already causing our family life to suffer.  She under-rotates her skills because of her height, and gets injured more frequently than others.  Her academics are suffering because of her gymnastics commitment.  Her life is going in the wrong direction because of gymnastics.  The bandaid is better ripped off earlier than later.  My husband agrees.\n\nI broke the news to my daughter. Frankly, it breaks my heart to tell her to give up something she has worked so hard for. I told her I know she is a hard worker. She would get much better reward if she channels her hard work elsewhere, like in school, or another sport. Hell, she plays tennis with the family only casually, yet she was able to win a few u12 tournaments locally. If that's not talent, I don't know what is!\n\nNeedless to say, she did not take that well. She cried and cried and cried, locking herself in her room, refusing to eat, saying maybe if she doesn't eat, she will become shorter. I told her over and over that I love her, and I just want the best for her, but she wouldn't have any of it. I tried to reason with her - telling her chasing a \"dream\" is a privilege, not a right.  No use!  My husband has now softened even though we used to have an agreement. Our family is now phoning us to try to persuade us to let her continue training, even offering support for training cost and pickup / drop-offs.\n\nIf she has the right body type to be an elite gymnast, or if she is tall like she is, but is not struggling because of her height, I would support her unconditionally. However that is not the case! Sometimes I feel like giving in, but to think it through, I was the person who drove her to training and competition, I am the breadwinner who paid for her training.  It should be my right to call it off, especially as a parent.\n\nHelp me out reddit.

Mom of D1 scholarship athlete. The most important thing you wrote is your daughter is getting injured. Truly, that should be it. Gymnastics is very hard on your body even if you don\u2019t have specific injuries. The daily wear and tear means a 18 yo is barely able to make it through 4 years of competition. Watch a few NCAA meets. A few schools look like their athletes are put together with duct tape. If your daughter has injuries like a sprained ankle or a pulled hamstring at 12, it will never fully heal. Gymnastics is 20 hours a week, 51 weeks a year. Then there are the really scary injuries that start to happen around growth spurts, typically puberty. Concussions, herniated discs, broken everything - feet, elbows, hands. Sometimes worse. \n\nThat being said, there are sports that transition nicely from gymnastics. One of the girls from our gym had chronic back pain and finally quit in 10th grade. She picked up diving, D1 scholarship, SEC rookie of the year in her sport. Another girl who broke her elbow ended up in pole vaulting and competes in college. My youngest did everything; gymnastics, theater, lax, poly sci club. She is playing a sport at the club level in college. There are girls on her team who never played before and they have a blast. \n\nYes, your daughter might hate you now but you will never forgive yourself if she ends up unable to do basic things like jogging, or hiking or even going on rides at Disney World because her passion is somehow more important than her health.", "What do her coaches say?

I still regret that decision years on, and it was MY decision, not my parents\u2019. I cannot imagine the resentment she will feel towards you for taking away what she really, really wants. Her hunger strike is her way of communicating to you, at 12 years old, what this means to her. Perhaps she doesn\u2019t value the socialising in the same way as you. That isn\u2019t how she wants to spend her time. \n\nI\u2019ll also add, I am also 5,7. Though, yes I am a male gymnast, I do not under-rotate my skills or have an increased risk of injury because of my height. 5,7 is a brilliant height for a gymnast. And she is only 12, she may be under-rotating now because she has grown taller, but the muscle development isn\u2019t quite there for the height. In time, and with conditioning, it will and she will stop under-rotating. It could also be her technique that is preventing her getting around. Don\u2019t be so quick to blame it on her height. Perhaps she isn\u2019t setting for her skills enough. That\u2019s another issue. \n\nI also think it\u2019s ridiculous to state that her chances of making it in tennis are higher than in gymnastics, because she has won some local tournaments. Look at the facts! She\u2019s already a national level gymnast aged 12. I know that path. I know what it\u2019s like to train 20+ hours per week. To suddenly switch that for another sport...besides, if money is an issue - stay away from tennis! Coincidentally, tennis is also my other sport. It\u2019s more costly than gymnastics. \n\nI would say you are in the right as her parent to call it all off. But I would say you are the asshole I\u2019m not giving your daughter a say, or the chance to voice her concern before you made your decision. I\u2019d also say you should speak to her coach(es) about the prospects of her making it to the top. A good coach won\u2019t lie. When I stopped competing, I had coaches from other clubs reach out to tell me I was making a mistake. That showed the reality of my potential. See what the coaches have to say. \n\nI\u2019d also like to add that gymnastics isn\u2019t so strict as it used to be. Your daughter could specialise in one of the four women\u2019s pieces (assuming you\u2019re talking artistic gymnastics). Floor, Beam, Vault, Bars - she doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be an all around champion. If you want to hone her into her strengths, for example let\u2019s say it is Beam, then see with the coaches if she is/will be able to specialise there. That would potentially require fewer training hours than an all around gymnast. Seeing as she is 12, I doubt they\u2019d let her specialise so young. They\u2019ll probably want to cover all 4 for a few more years before they really allow any specialisation. That was my mistake, I stopped before I was allowed to specialise (floor and vault for me!). \n\nSpeak with your daughter and her coach to see if specialising is an option. Yes you have paid for her training so far, and technically it is your right, however by paying for her up to such a high level, you have implied to her that you would support her in her journey.

I tried other sports during seasons when there was nowhere to do the one I enjoy and it kept me active but was never really the same; I always made it back to what I enjoy. It gives me an outlet and keeps me in shape. So you're not just 'investing' in the possibility of going pro, you are allowing your child to have a passion and live it out.

It was a great way to keep in shape, and kept me connected to my friends and a place that felt like home. It was also a lot less hours so I took up fencing and horseback riding in my newfound free time. \n\n\nI then kept coaching for 7 years and traveled in the summer to some expensive boarding style summer camps to teach it as a head coach. \n\n\nAlso while she probably won't go to the Olympics university gymnastics had some decent scholarships and they really don't care the same way about height or body type. So she could have a future in gymnastics that could pay for university, if she wants to continue it. \n\n\nAnother way to approach cutting down on gymnastics is to add in other classes like dance and ballet, which will help the gymnastics as well as strengthen muscles that will help her not get hurt as often.

I loved it, too.  And I would have done anything to go elite... until I suffered a catastrophic injury. I'm lucky and was able to heal from it completely.

I don\u2019t see how you can say NAH when parent said it\u2019s not worth investing in daughters passion because she is too tall for the Olympics.  OP said that if daughter had the right body type they would still support it, so for OP it\u2019s not about daughters skill.  They just don\u2019t like their daughter sticking out from other gymnasts, even if she is better.  It all about image for OP.  I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t have parents like that when I grew up.

They paid for soccer training and traveling to tournaments even knowing I wouldn\u2019t be a World Cup player. They did what they could to support me, and I think it\u2019s wrong to only see investing in a child passion for a physical return like an Olympic medal.

They almost never, ever, EVER go pro witu those hobbies.

Maybe your daughter will try competitive cheerleading \u2014 there\u2019s scholarships for that. Maybe she\u2019ll get into dance. Or diving. Maybe she\u2019ll get the acting bug and use her skills for stunt work. Or personal training. Or acrobatics, or cirque du soleil, or broadway, or aerials.

This attitude is setting her up for serious inferiority issues in the future.\n\nYTA for another reason, too, though: it\u2019s clear your daughter\u2019s relationship with the sport is unhealthy. She needs a social life outside of gymnastics. She needs to eat healthily (and forced perfectionism from my parents played a big role in my own disordered eating.) She needs to take breaks so she doesn\u2019t get injured. Your daughter is literally starving herself in a desire to be perfect. Taking this sport away will just punish her for not being perfect. She needs therapy, and a change of pace, and *the knowledge that you will love and support her in her hobbies even as she gets taller and less competitive.*\n\nTHIS is how body dysmorphia happens. I recommend both individual and family therapy.\n\nYou should have been enforcing those boundaries all along. You don\u2019t get to suddenly take away your child\u2019s entire life just because you realized now that you failed earlier. \n\nYou can start enforcing boundaries now, even though it\u2019s going to be hard. You can start to teach her to have a healthy relationship with her body and with her sport of choice. You can teach her it\u2019s OK to love yourself, your hobbies, your skills, and your body without needing 100% perfection.\n\nYou are the cause of your daughter\u2019s struggles. Not gymnastics.

Based on the other aspects of their lives, OP and their husband apparently believe that right now the best way to do that is to stop. Which makes sense, since OP clarified that her daughter refuses to do it recreationally or at a lower level. Her coaches have even told them she isn\u2019t where she needs to be skill-wise for someone with her goals. If she is frequently hurting herself while trying to push her limits, I fully agree with that stance.\n\nEven Simone Biles, ***widely considered the best female gymnast the world has seen***, has stopped herself from continuing because of safety concerns. **She literally pulled out of the Olympics because she had the twisties and wasn\u2019t confident in her ability to orient herself as she moved through the air**.

My personal anatomy still allowed me to be competitive though, so I do think the disadvantages your daughter has in gymanstics are probably bigger than the ones I had... but you know, there are ways to work around them. It would mean she probably has to train more than othres and find a way for her specific physicality to keep up with others.. but you know.. if she loves it, she loves it. Yeah, it might hurt when she realises it herself, but at least she would've left it on her own accord.

I look at it as similar to the increasing numbers of parents not wanting their kids to play American football because of the significant concussion risks - it sucks if the kid wants to play the sport, but if there are real risks to their safety by letting them play, I can't blame a parent for saying no to that", "What did you major in?", "How do you know it will only be a hobby at best?

They would basically brainwash kids into thinking that singular club or sport was all that mattered.\n\nGiven the way OP's kid is acting, I am very concerned that her gymnastics instructor/coach/whatever the term is, might be telling her that. I'm worried she might be hearing that same \"nothing matters except this\" rhetoric, and it's super damaging.  \n Because realistically, *most* people can't turn sports into a full-time job, unless they're going to be a teacher or trainer. I'm all for chasing your dreams - but you also need to have a backup plan, because not everyone *reaches* their dream.

This is what separates athletes at this age.", "Exactly! You cannot deal with an obsession by just telling someone they wont be successful, of course thats going to result in a complete melt down.

I used to do gymnastics, not in a professional level but still pretty commited. I had training 6 times a week, 2 hours each. So 12 in total. Which was already a lot.

Listen to your daughter, allow her to express exactly what gymnastics means to her, and in turn explain your concerns. Then, together, discuss how to move forward in a way that doesn't force daughter to give up her passion, but also expands her horizons. Come to a decision on how much time she should be spending on her grades, how much time she's with friends. Hell, do some research together on what's healthy for her age on all of those points. Help her see where you're coming from, and please try harder to see her side too.

You should be feeling grateful that some higher power has given you an opportunity to provide that kind of life for you and your children!\n\nEdit2: Also I'm in in Canada.....do you know how many parents pay thousands for their kids to play hockey each year? Between training camps, skates, hockey gear, out of town games etc. The cost is crazy! Yet they do this for their  children knowing that  their precious Benji in the corner isn't. Isn't making it into the NHL", "YTA. You suck so bad. I played sports all my life and went on to play for a year at the D2 level, but decided it wasn\u2019t for me anymore because of burn out. Your daughter\u2019s dedication and care for her sport is amazing, she has a passion I never did. Who gives AF if she doesn\u2019t go D1, there\u2019s nothing wrong with D2, D3, junior college, whatever so long as she loves what she does.", "YTA. I was a 5\u20195 D1 gymnast. This isn\u2019t Romania, and college gymnastics differs greatly from club. At 12, her chances of becoming good enough at another sport to garner scholarship attention are minuscule. \n\nNOW. Under rotating skills & frequent injury are a coaching problem, not a height problem. Her grades suffering is a priorities problem. If you\u2019re burnt out and over it, I can\u2019t say I blame you (God knows my parents were by the end), but you don\u2019t have a height problem. She knows she\u2019s taller than everyone else. Don\u2019t make her resent her body more.", "YTA, why would you put your own child down like that?

Be a decent mother and support her.", "YTA for how you're phrasing all this to her.\n\nYou completely have the right to not be spending thousands of dollars on this unlikely dream while her school, health, and all of you suffer.\n\nBut what you should have done is let her continue to partake in gymnastics more casually, and remind her that while the chances of her getting into the Olympics are incredibly slim, you're still glad she has found her happy place. Let her enjoy her passion in a reasonable amount.\n\nRight now you have basically taught this little girl \"You will never be good enough, even if you try your hardest at what you love, because of your physical disadvantage.

My parents actually tried desperately to get me into tennis or golf which I had a knack for but I hated it. The idea that ripping that Bandaid off earlier would be at all helpful is misguided. She\u2019s 12. She\u2019s going to get taller, and older, the dream of elite gymnastics will fade naturally but her love of the sport might not. I\u2019m can tell you exactly where my parents trying to force me into tennis landed me: in a gymnastics gym ten hours a week after law school, and very very far away from a tennis court.", "YTA. Just because she has a lessor (although not impossible) chance of going to the olympics doesn't make this gymnastics stuff pointless. There are so many other options. She could compete in other competitions or she could become a gymnastics teacher which from my understanding is quite lucrative amongst many things. \n\nRegardless, this is something she enjoys and could still at least be a hobby for her that she does for fun even if it doesn't lead to anything. You could absolutely help her develop more balance between her gymnastics and the rest of her life given you did bring up a legitimate concern there although completely getting rid of the gymnastics is nuclear. \n\nNot to mention, gymnastics can be a precursor for also related sports such as trampoleening or diving which she may have a better Olympics chance with.", " YTA.

It keeps them active and they learn so much more than how to skate and shoot a puck (or stop one in my middle one\u2019s case). \n\nTo tell your daughter to quit because *you* don\u2019t think she can reach the peak of her sport is honestly a terrible, terrible precedent to set. You won\u2019t be valedictorian, why finish high school? Your cooking isn\u2019t going to earn you Michelin stars, better give that up! You didn\u2019t get the promotion at work? Time to quit!

Any good coach should emphasize keeping at least a healthy school/training balance.", "this is exactly the comment I was looking for, as someone who also did gymnastics for a long time I would have also freaked out if my parent told me to stop because of my body type and at 12 it's really hard to understand the burden that training so much puts on the whole family. I think that talking to the coach, physio or doctor whoever is being seen for the injuries to see how much of an effect the sport is having on her would probably put things into perspective and help her understand. also switching sports just like that after being really good at one sport is hard to wrap your head around, but I def think that slowly introducing sports that are similar to gymnastics could help", "Also, world champion and Olympic champion Nina Derweal is 5'7", "Rhythmic gymnastics is a good hard sport.. \n\nBut people don't understand it really has very little to do with gymnastics.

The fact that she said that maybe if she doesn\u2019t eat she won\u2019t be tall concerns me.

If your daughter was a boy and her ambition was to be a professional jockey i doubt people would be questioning your decision. But it is the same concept. People over a certain height have different proportions, different center if balance.

My parents emptied our savings and then used my money from working (I started working at 14 so I could have time out of the house and be with people and also save to leave at 18). My sister had hella physical and mental issues from  it. I really think it caused  personality problems. She is so competitive and arrogant and has zero humility. She majorly struggled with relationships in high school and college. No one was good enough for her and she thought she was better than everyone and everything. She couldn\u2019t keep a job until family hand delivered her one. My parents still feed that dynamic into adulthood and ignore other issues that popped up (alcoholism/DUI/assault charges). Whenever I would bring up that there were real problems that maybe we should intervene on, I was verbally attacked, and gaslit. To this day she is an extension of my mom and dad financially supports her.  My mom is coparenting her children and her husband now gets the treatment my brother and I got.

I knew that failing and falling was part of the sport. I miss it now, being older and not able to do stuff like I used to but it was so so SO worth it to me to have gymnastics in my life. I lived in that gym upwards of like 28h a week from coaching to working at the same gym. Please do not take this away from someone so passionate. \n\nThere were girls on my team taller then me that made it into D1 schools and got athletic scholarships.

I grew up in a gymnastics family, I did gymnastics as did my older sister (my older sister eventually went to a D1 college for gymnastics on a full ride scholarship). We have met MANY people through gymnastics whether that\u2019s other competitors or teammates. She has MANY MANY friends who are 5\u20198+ who were able to go to college for gymnastics on scholarship. \n\nBut beside that my bigger concern is the fact that you feel justified crushing your daughter\u2019s PASSIONS and DREAMS just because you might not get something out if it. If she doesn\u2019t end up going to a college for it then so be it, she had fun and loved the sport. She was able to build up her team working skills and show how loyal and dedicated she is to something. Also if you TRULY wanted the best for her then you would let her continue because you love to see your daughter HAPPY and LOVE something INSTEAD of crushing her passions because you as her parents won\u2019t get something out of it. \n\nAnother thing that I will warn you of if you choose to continue on, you will HAVE to CHANGE your ways of talking to your daughter. The fact that your daughter is saying that if she stops eating then she might not grow is CONCERNING. Gymnasts already a high chance of having an eating disorder because of the AH coaches in this sport so you as her mom SHOULD NOT contribute to that, you NEED to STOP being an AH and letting your daughter think this way about food because of what YOU said to make her think that way. \n\nBut as a side note, like I said I grew up in a gymnastics family so here is a different piece of advice. If money is an issue since the sport is extremely expensive then instead of crushing her hopes and dreams the way you did, instead explain the TRUTH that you simply cannot afford the cost of the sport for much longer and offer alternatives (many ex gymnast friends of ours went on to be collegiate divers) while highlighting that it isn\u2019t her height or the difficulty of a scholarship/going elite that is the issue but instead it\u2019s a financial issue. I also see your concerns for her social life/school/health etc. I understand those concerns (my sister didn\u2019t really have a social life besides the gym girls but she still had good grades). I think you need to present these concerns in a better way as well. Also the part of her under rotating her skills, you either need to speak to her coach or to her about it and express your concerns better that highlights your concerns for her health INSTEAD of getting a scholarship out if it. Overall, I think the way you presented all of your issues to her wasn\u2019t the best and was definitely AH-ish especially coming from her mom. You seemed more concerned about what you as parents would/could get out of it instead of showing genuine concern for your daughter\u2019s well-being and life.", "I think you\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing. Her being tall isn\u2019t the problem that you should be focusing on. Her injuries, not focusing on schooling, and her not having a social life should be.

From a young age, he trained more than 20 hours per week, missed school for training and competitions, and didn\u2019t have the chance to go to parties etc. He had many injuries, which he proudly endured as proof of his efforts. I\u2019m pretty sure if I had pulled him out of gymnastics, even though I knew he didn\u2019t have a chance at Olympic or collegiate success, that he would have sunk into a depression and maybe even killed himself. And it would have been grossly unfair given he was truly giving it his all. \n\nBut he LOVED it. His friends were his teammates. His coaches were his mentors. He lived to learn and master new skills. He developed discipline through training, learned the hard way that results require effort and repetition. Nothing came easily. \n\nHis rapid growth started to impact his ability to win competitions and soon he had to relearn some skills due to his centre of gravity changing and his long limbs hampering his efforts. It was tough for him seeing his fellow team mates (who were all much shorter than him) succeed so easily by comparison, but it was a lesson to learn - even if you train your hardest and give it your all, you may not win - and sometimes you have to find a new outlet for your efforts. But it was his lesson to learn, not mine to force upon him. \n\nHe soon found that gymnastics had other uses though. He changed to training in Tramp and Tumbling and Acrobatic Gymnastics for a short while. Then he moved into the world of \u201cCirque\u201d. Before long, Cirque due Soleil were following his Instagram as well as a circus troupe for elite children known as Le Petit Cirque.\n\nHe started performing as a circus artist and even travelled to Oslo, Norway to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert where his troupe received a standing ovation in a stadium of thousands, including the royal family! He had an incredible experience performing with them.\n\nBy the time he was 15, he decided to pursue other interests and today (at 19) doesn\u2019t do any gymnastics, circus, dance or acrobatics. Instead, he is living an awesome life working part time, studying at university, and hanging out with his partner. He has discipline that most kids who grew up without gymnastics (or another passion requiring training) simply haven\u2019t got yet. \n\nYour daughter has worked so hard in her chosen passion. Don\u2019t take it away for her due to circumstances completely out of her control. She will eventually change course on her own, and will keep the discipline and joy from her skills, and will appreciate the efforts you put in to her being able to achieve the goals she does master. \n\nI look back at how much I spent on his training, how many hours I spent driving him to training and sitting in the stands waiting, with the knowledge that today - he wouldn\u2019t be able to do a quarter of the skills he had once easily done. But that\u2019s okay. As parents, our job isn\u2019t to put our kids in activities that will lead to careers, but rather to help them find and develop their passions and offer encouragement even when they end those activities forever. \n\nPlease don\u2019t pull your daughter out until she is ready to leave or YTA.", "I hate the way people keep phrasing this as OP \"stepping in\" as though OP is some random good samaritan and this little girl created this situation herself.

Even when I was small enough to do JO competitively, I did so knowing that actually making it to the Olympics or D1 was a crapshoot of genetics and other competitors.\n\nMy parents taught me to value the sport for love of it and didn\u2019t pull the rug out from underneath me.

She was forced to retire from competitive skating with a permanent, severe back injury, and her body can go longer turn in one direction.\n\nA healthy balance between physical achievement and physical safety needs to be paramount.

Still lots of conditioning, etc. but there was just no way to maintain the muscle mass I had as a gymnast. One of my shoulders is now permanently kind of\u2026 loose? It doesn\u2019t sit right on its socket, which puts pressure on neck muscles and creates issues. I got it checked out many years ago and was told that either ligaments or tendons (can\u2019t remember which) had been stretched out and didn\u2019t snap back properly anymore, but that my gymnast muscles had been holding my shoulder in place. Once those muscles weren\u2019t as strong, my shoulder just didn\u2019t have the support it needed anymore. 20 years later and it\u2019s still a problem. I wonder if a physical therapist could help you all anticipate potential issues like this and work to prevent them?", "I think you should lay clear for her the whole situation:\n1. Have her coaches tell her honestly were she standing.\n2. Hace her talk to a doctor about the concequences trainning can have on her body. \n3. Let her know she will only be getting x ammount of money from you and she has ti come up with the rest. \n4. Set clear expectations about her grades and family time.\n5. If possible have her talk with a former gymnast in her situation.\n\nHave her decide, she is only 12, which is not young in gymnastics terms, but really young irl.

Own_Faithlessness769 it's not about telling her no, it's about re-channeling her passion. Someone here mentioned switching to diving, which has no height limitations.

It was so sad when my coach told my mom that I couldn't come to practice anymore because my weight had dropped dangerously low and I was burning muscle, so he didn't want me back tucking myself to death. \n\nBut I was okay, because I had other extracurriculars to be a part of, I had friends, I followed other passions. OPs kid has none of these and THAT'S what I see as the problem. I was in the gym 4-6 days a week as a non-competitive gymnast, easily hitting 20 hours most weeks, but I still had an identity outside of the sport. OPs kid has made being a competitive gymnast her entire identity and this can't be solved by quitting - that poor kid needs therapy yesterday.\n\nI'm only saying YTA for the way that OP has phrased it and handling the situation badly.

Not only does the increase in height hurt their progress and chance of being considered for the Olympics, the development of breasts affects their balance and adds further body mass. \n\nStrenuous exercise and calorie restriction are most often the ways in which ruthless instructors and stage parents try to stave off puberty. \n\nIf a child is significantly underweight and malnourished, their body will not be able to sustain the developmental changes that take place during puberty. \n\nThe few nutrients their body does receive (that aren\u2019t used up through exercise) are being used to maintain vital functions. Puberty is sidelined. \n\nThis dangerous approach can temporarily stop puberty after it\u2019s already begun, which may be what OP\u2019s daughter is trying to do.\n\nUnfortunately, this highly damaging approach is very common amongst parents and coaches in the most competitive and brutal circles. If do you get your period, you\u2019ll be reprimanded for \u201cnot training hard enough\u201d.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even the most extreme approach.

Not only do they suppress appetite, they keep you energised and increase focus, both of which maximum your training ability.\n\nI know all of this because I was friends with a competitive dancer growing up.

For one, he loathed stretching and wasn't very flexible.  It naturally died out for him and while he enjoyed it while it lasted, he soon realized he liked other things better and it wasn't hard to encourage him into swimming and trying fencing for instance.  It did a good job about teaching how his body moved in space which he took to other sports.    \n\n\nAt that level there is little chance for serious injury.

She is not selfish for working so hard and falling in love with a sport you started her in.

There are hard things we all must decide in life, she will too. This could prepare her for thinking critically through situations, finding out how to make hard decisions while utilizing appropriate research and support, and healing herself physically and mentally from all this stress and the lack of age appropriate activities (socializing).\n\nYou have the option to set her up for success in life while being loved and supported OR trampling her spirit, causing resentment, and probably damaging your relationship with her forever.

In an environment where resource is scarce, survival is of the utmost importance and \"dream\" has little space in this discussion.
