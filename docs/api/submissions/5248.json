{"id": 5248, "submission_id": "zr55br", "title": "AITA for not wanting to continue supporting my daughter's (12F) gymnastics training", "selftext": "When my daughter was young, we introduced her to gymnastics.  She was totally hooked and kept asking for more and more lessons. We encouraged her, thinking she will eventually lose interest. Now she is 12, training 20 hours a week, spending weekends after weekends competing at high level competitions.\n\nProblem is, she is 5'7 already and still growing. She is starting to have ambition for D1 scholarship, or even Olympics. That makes me very worried. Being 5'7 basically kills her chance of going to the Olympics. D1 gymnastics scholarship is already rare, the odds of her getting one with her height is even more rare.\n\nIt makes me feel bad that our daughter is very, very dedicated. She's almost always the first one at the gym and the last one to leave. She watches replays of her routine on our drive to training, turns down social events because she \"needs to train\", does extra conditioning at home.\n\nYet I cannot justify blowing thousands of dollars a year and hundreds of hours in time every year to gamble on something with so little chance of success. All the hours spent at her training, driving her to competition is already causing our family life to suffer.  She under-rotates her skills because of her height, and gets injured more frequently than others.  Her academics are suffering because of her gymnastics commitment.  Her life is going in the wrong direction because of gymnastics.  The bandaid is better ripped off earlier than later.  My husband agrees.\n\nI broke the news to my daughter. Frankly, it breaks my heart to tell her to give up something she has worked so hard for. I told her I know she is a hard worker. She would get much better reward if she channels her hard work elsewhere, like in school, or another sport. Hell, she plays tennis with the family only casually, yet she was able to win a few u12 tournaments locally. If that's not talent, I don't know what is!\n\nNeedless to say, she did not take that well. She cried and cried and cried, locking herself in her room, refusing to eat, saying maybe if she doesn't eat, she will become shorter. I told her over and over that I love her, and I just want the best for her, but she wouldn't have any of it. I tried to reason with her - telling her chasing a \"dream\" is a privilege, not a right.  No use!  My husband has now softened even though we used to have an agreement. Our family is now phoning us to try to persuade us to let her continue training, even offering support for training cost and pickup / drop-offs.\n\nIf she has the right body type to be an elite gymnast, or if she is tall like she is, but is not struggling because of her height, I would support her unconditionally. However that is not the case! Sometimes I feel like giving in, but to think it through, I was the person who drove her to training and competition, I am the breadwinner who paid for her training.  It should be my right to call it off, especially as a parent.\n\nHelp me out reddit.

I was also dedicated to tap when most of the girls were not so that allowed me to get parts others couldn't do. \n\nAnd you're right, it did become more fun. I didn't have the pressure of auditioning for roles I had no hope of getting. I could explore other things and eventually started also taking dance roles in musical productions (I can't sing lol).

Now you are curtailing your support for something out of her control. She didn\u2019t become 5\u20197\u201d overnight, and this should have been an ongoing conversation with every injury / poor grade / skipped friend plan. I see also that you\u2019ve enabled a push-pull cycle where she attains grades solely so she can train; you should be monitoring her academics on an ongoing basis so that she doesn\u2019t cycle.

Why didn't it stop them? Cuz it made me fucking happy and if you're a parent your kids happiness means the world to you. So my parents paid for me to be in swim leagues and let me spend a few hours every day swimming. They supported me doing this all the way to when I was 18.\n\n That's why this dudes being an asshole.

I would be curious if mom has talk to the coach about this. my main issue with it is she says the daughter keeps getting injured because of her height and that is well documented among tall young women who try to become gymnast.
