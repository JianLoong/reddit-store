She should have gotten up and left when you first said \"it's a little too late for that after she cheated on my big brother and humiliated him.\" People can and do repair relationships after affairs, but getting into a debate with you over it was pointless.\n\nYour brother is an asshole for thinking this kind of information should have been announced in a \"surprise dinner\" like that.

He should be smart enough to realize this looks extremely bad and will go over like a lead balloon. You should be tactful enough to realize that even if you dislike the fiancee and even if you think he's making a mistake and needs a pregnancy test, *very publicly* saying you aren't going to the wedding and that he needs to get tested is a tremendous asshole move, and will also probably backfire because you've made the paternity test about shitting on the fiancee and not caring about your brother. ESH.\n\nE: Also, not attending your own brother's wedding because you don't like the fiancee is very likely asshole behavior to begin with unless she's done something to personally wrong you; refusing to attend because she harmed your brother and they claim to have forgiven and moved past it is going to destroy your relationship with him.", "ESH\n\nYou had your say and now you have to let Bro do what he's gonna do\n\nHe's a dummy if you ask me but if that's the life he wants, it's his to live", "NTA for telling him to get paternity test, YTA for saying it in front of the GF", "ESH.

If she didn't cheat there is zero reason she wouldn't want to get a paternity test for his and the family's peace of mind.  And I say this as a woman who is currently pregnant, cheated in the past, and got a paternity test for my husband's peace of mind lol.  I'm basically an expert in this situation. I didn't want anyone to question anything during the pregnancy so I was the one who suggested and paid for the test just to prove to everyone that I haven't cheated. It was YEARS ago when I did but it's hard to move past things and I take full responsibility. So I paid for DNA Diagnostic Centers which is the only legally admissible paternity test in the US for testing before the baby is born. We did it around 12 weeks. They took my blood and took a swab from my husband's mouth. Perfect match. Everyone is happy. Pregnancy has been wonderful since that test. There's no reason for her to deny testing if she knows and admits she cheated in the past and it's going to leave some open wounds.", "NTA \n\n...but it breaks my heart. It reminds me of a friend who I loved dearly who was in love with this woman. While they were dating she cheats on him and is pregnant with her ex's baby. The ex ran off to the military and my friend decided to raise the child. They get engaged and she's pregnant again, but I did what you did. Demanded paternity tests. Refused to be at the wedding. \n\nHe got married, the second baby came and my friend did the paternity test. Looks like baby #2 is also not his... He hasn't spoken to me since the engagement announcement. Either out of embarrassment or resentment. I regret that. I wish I was more supportive because I heard rumors he committed suicide not long after. \n\nI think a paternity test is in order. It's not an unreasonable request. I would ask your brother this - if you were in his shoes what would he advise you to do? Given the information you and your family have. Let's just say for arguments sake it is someone else's baby.
