She should have gotten up and left when you first said \"it's a little too late for that after she cheated on my big brother and humiliated him.\" People can and do repair relationships after affairs, but getting into a debate with you over it was pointless.\n\nYour brother is an asshole for thinking this kind of information should have been announced in a \"surprise dinner\" like that.

He should be smart enough to realize this looks extremely bad and will go over like a lead balloon. You should be tactful enough to realize that even if you dislike the fiancee and even if you think he's making a mistake and needs a pregnancy test, *very publicly* saying you aren't going to the wedding and that he needs to get tested is a tremendous asshole move, and will also probably backfire because you've made the paternity test about shitting on the fiancee and not caring about your brother. ESH.\n\nE: Also, not attending your own brother's wedding because you don't like the fiancee is very likely asshole behavior to begin with unless she's done something to personally wrong you; refusing to attend because she harmed your brother and they claim to have forgiven and moved past it is going to destroy your relationship with him.", "ESH\n\nYou had your say and now you have to let Bro do what he's gonna do\n\nHe's a dummy if you ask me but if that's the life he wants, it's his to live", "NTA for telling him to get paternity test, YTA for saying it in front of the GF", "ESH.

If she didn't cheat there is zero reason she wouldn't want to get a paternity test for his and the family's peace of mind.  And I say this as a woman who is currently pregnant, cheated in the past, and got a paternity test for my husband's peace of mind lol.  I'm basically an expert in this situation. I didn't want anyone to question anything during the pregnancy so I was the one who suggested and paid for the test just to prove to everyone that I haven't cheated. It was YEARS ago when I did but it's hard to move past things and I take full responsibility. So I paid for DNA Diagnostic Centers which is the only legally admissible paternity test in the US for testing before the baby is born. We did it around 12 weeks. They took my blood and took a swab from my husband's mouth. Perfect match. Everyone is happy. Pregnancy has been wonderful since that test. There's no reason for her to deny testing if she knows and admits she cheated in the past and it's going to leave some open wounds.", "NTA \n\n...but it breaks my heart. It reminds me of a friend who I loved dearly who was in love with this woman. While they were dating she cheats on him and is pregnant with her ex's baby. The ex ran off to the military and my friend decided to raise the child. They get engaged and she's pregnant again, but I did what you did. Demanded paternity tests. Refused to be at the wedding. \n\nHe got married, the second baby came and my friend did the paternity test. Looks like baby #2 is also not his... He hasn't spoken to me since the engagement announcement. Either out of embarrassment or resentment. I regret that. I wish I was more supportive because I heard rumors he committed suicide not long after. \n\nI think a paternity test is in order. It's not an unreasonable request. I would ask your brother this - if you were in his shoes what would he advise you to do? Given the information you and your family have. Let's just say for arguments sake it is someone else's baby.

If it\u2019s truly to help your brother, stay in touch with him, heck, even agree to attend the wedding. In the meantime, start asking him questions, ones that he has to start asking himself.  How did they get back together? Who initiated contact? What\u2019s the due date? How far along is she? Did they start having sex right away? What happened to the last guy? \n\nYes, those questions might make him mad, but that\u2019s because they make him have doubts.  Ask them over time, if you can.  Don\u2019t include your parents, only other siblings if you have. We all know they most likely scenario is that she got pregnant and needed a husband/father fast. So, she went back the guy who still loves her.

Your brother is making a big mistake, but getting a paternity test is a bare minimum! If the child is his, then great. However, if it is not, he needs to know that so the child's real father can be found. If your brother marries her and has this child, get a DNA test that he can take and mail away. One day, when he brings over the baby, swab the baby and then ask him to swab himself and then send that in.

I think the OP is 100% right to push the brother to demand a paternity test and/or to advocate against the marriage.

I'm happy to validate your feelings about her cheating on your brother, the timing of the pregnancy and the whole situation, but the question under discussion is if you were the asshole -- and you were. You let your feelings dictate your actions and create what has the potential to be a very large rift in your family. The mature way to do it is to approach your brother privately and say something like, \"I love you, and I'm really glad to see that you've been doing so much better lately. I'm concerned that getting back together with someone who hurt you so badly won't end well, and the timing of the pregnancy is suspicious -- but maybe you already know everything about that you need to. Anyway, I love you and I just want your happiness. I'll support that in any way I can.\"\n\nYou don't get to hold a grudge on someone else's behalf. If he's ready to forgive her, then you just go along with it. He may know the baby isn't his, and he's fine with it. Or the baby may actually be his, and your knowledge of the timing is incomplete. We can't force family members to make decisions that we think are in their best interest. We can just love and support and keep the doors open and hope for the best.\n\nSuppose that in 10 years they're still a loving, happy couple with an adorable child. What do you want your relationship with them to be? Do you want to be estranged from your brother because you could never forgive his wife for cheating on him? Do you want to to explain to their child why you aren't in any of the wedding photos?\n\nIf this thought process doesn't help, then turn it around. If someone you loved hurt you badly, but then made amends and reconciled, would you want your family to give them another chance or refuse to accept them and throw their past mistake in your faces?", ">Cheaters can change and just because they cheat once doesn\u2019t mean they will do it again.\n\nSo are you a cheater or the one being cheated on?", "So which is it: back off or support it?", "This is regionally different.", "Not necessarily true.

But it is not really OP\u2019s business and this sub gets real self righteous when it comes to punishing cheaters, especially women. \n\nIf the brother and his fianc\u00e9e have worked through it OP and family have a right to be skeptical and still upset with her but taking such a hard stance about her, the pregnancy and the wedding is definitely going to cause the brother no contact. \n\nEither way, OP is probably not going to get that \u201cI told you so\u201d their pining for because they basically just showed the brother that they care more about being right and drawing lines in the and than they care about him and his well-being.", "I think a bit along this line, however, the thing that tips the scale the other way is the surprise of the event. Like hey, not only are we back to gather, but we're getting married and former cheating GF is pregnant.\n\nThat's a huge bomb to drop when prior to that this ex-GF was essentially known as brother's world wrecker. To not have told sister or family any of those three pieces before this moment was a very poor choice. It suggest to me he's still basically broken and could be doing this out of emotional desperation and/or is being manipulated. I'd have a hard time sitting still for that. OP's initial questions were not completely out of line given all these circumstances and GF didn't really take a seeking acceptance route herself. Instead she got defensive and things spiraled. Maybe OP can come around and still go to the wedding and make some amends with the brother, but this GF, now fiancee, is a piece of work and regardless of this incident, it kind of sounds like OP and brother's fiancee are not going to get along.

If you want to have a chance of changing his mind, you need to talk to him in private, ASAP.
