She should have gotten up and left when you first said \"it's a little too late for that after she cheated on my big brother and humiliated him.\" People can and do repair relationships after affairs, but getting into a debate with you over it was pointless.\n\nYour brother is an asshole for thinking this kind of information should have been announced in a \"surprise dinner\" like that.

He should be smart enough to realize this looks extremely bad and will go over like a lead balloon. You should be tactful enough to realize that even if you dislike the fiancee and even if you think he's making a mistake and needs a pregnancy test, *very publicly* saying you aren't going to the wedding and that he needs to get tested is a tremendous asshole move, and will also probably backfire because you've made the paternity test about shitting on the fiancee and not caring about your brother. ESH.\n\nE: Also, not attending your own brother's wedding because you don't like the fiancee is very likely asshole behavior to begin with unless she's done something to personally wrong you; refusing to attend because she harmed your brother and they claim to have forgiven and moved past it is going to destroy your relationship with him.", "ESH\n\nYou had your say and now you have to let Bro do what he's gonna do\n\nHe's a dummy if you ask me but if that's the life he wants, it's his to live", "NTA for telling him to get paternity test, YTA for saying it in front of the GF", "ESH.

If she didn't cheat there is zero reason she wouldn't want to get a paternity test for his and the family's peace of mind.  And I say this as a woman who is currently pregnant, cheated in the past, and got a paternity test for my husband's peace of mind lol.  I'm basically an expert in this situation. I didn't want anyone to question anything during the pregnancy so I was the one who suggested and paid for the test just to prove to everyone that I haven't cheated. It was YEARS ago when I did but it's hard to move past things and I take full responsibility. So I paid for DNA Diagnostic Centers which is the only legally admissible paternity test in the US for testing before the baby is born. We did it around 12 weeks. They took my blood and took a swab from my husband's mouth. Perfect match. Everyone is happy. Pregnancy has been wonderful since that test. There's no reason for her to deny testing if she knows and admits she cheated in the past and it's going to leave some open wounds.", "NTA \n\n...but it breaks my heart. It reminds me of a friend who I loved dearly who was in love with this woman. While they were dating she cheats on him and is pregnant with her ex's baby. The ex ran off to the military and my friend decided to raise the child. They get engaged and she's pregnant again, but I did what you did. Demanded paternity tests. Refused to be at the wedding. \n\nHe got married, the second baby came and my friend did the paternity test. Looks like baby #2 is also not his... He hasn't spoken to me since the engagement announcement. Either out of embarrassment or resentment. I regret that. I wish I was more supportive because I heard rumors he committed suicide not long after. \n\nI think a paternity test is in order. It's not an unreasonable request. I would ask your brother this - if you were in his shoes what would he advise you to do? Given the information you and your family have. Let's just say for arguments sake it is someone else's baby.

If it\u2019s truly to help your brother, stay in touch with him, heck, even agree to attend the wedding. In the meantime, start asking him questions, ones that he has to start asking himself.  How did they get back together? Who initiated contact? What\u2019s the due date? How far along is she? Did they start having sex right away? What happened to the last guy? \n\nYes, those questions might make him mad, but that\u2019s because they make him have doubts.  Ask them over time, if you can.  Don\u2019t include your parents, only other siblings if you have. We all know they most likely scenario is that she got pregnant and needed a husband/father fast. So, she went back the guy who still loves her.  He needs to see that, but can\u2019t let himself, because he wants to live in his fantasy.  \n\nIf your aim is to support your brother, consider playing the long and slow game.

Your brother is making a big mistake, but getting a paternity test is a bare minimum! If the child is his, then great. However, if it is not, he needs to know that so the child's real father can be found. If your brother marries her and has this child, get a DNA test that he can take and mail away. One day, when he brings over the baby, swab the baby and then ask him to swab himself and then send that in.

I made the case to him why he shouldn't get married, and then when he did so anyway, I was a supportive groomsman. The reason was simple: if you care about somebody, it sometimes means supporting them in choices you don't agree with. I think the OP is 100% right to push the brother to demand a paternity test and/or to advocate against the marriage.

I'm happy to validate your feelings about her cheating on your brother, the timing of the pregnancy and the whole situation, but the question under discussion is if you were the asshole -- and you were. You let your feelings dictate your actions and create what has the potential to be a very large rift in your family. The mature way to do it is to approach your brother privately and say something like, \"I love you, and I'm really glad to see that you've been doing so much better lately. I'm concerned that getting back together with someone who hurt you so badly won't end well, and the timing of the pregnancy is suspicious -- but maybe you already know everything about that you need to. Anyway, I love you and I just want your happiness. I'll support that in any way I can.\"\n\nYou don't get to hold a grudge on someone else's behalf.
