She loves you and wants you to live a long life and 2. Maybe this whole diet change is hard for _her_ and seeing you indulge yourself is making it harder for her to stay on track.\n\nRather than brushing her off why don't you both sit down and compare the diets you're doing and see if you can combine them together, that would be a more supportive way to deal with this conflict.

Instead respond, \"thanks for sharing your new knowledge and looking out for my health. This is my cheat treat for the week and I know it has high sugar. I'm going to get it anyway.\" If she continues to push things, then have a conversation where you calmly state your boundaries about food and that you will support her on her journey, but that you don't want her telling you what to eat or how to workout.
