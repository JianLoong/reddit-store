I mean, really, if this is a true story then that person is definitely going to know it\u2019s about them if they read it.", "Until your girlfriend becomes a medical professional or nutritionist then specifically becomes your chosen medical professional/nutritionist-NTA\n\nYou know what you are doing to your body and health. You know what works best for you.", " NTA. She\u2019s condescending. All it is, is that she now feels she has a bit of power and knowledge because of her new course and she thinks it\u2019s ok to lecture everyone else. My narcissistic mother does this and it\u2019s just an attempt at feeling better than someone else.", "Nta. She needs to learn that everyone has different bodies and different goals for their bodies. Finding a diet/exercise routine that suits your body and your goals is very individual; she is not entitled to dictate your body. Your girlfriend might be trying to be helpful, but was still out of line.", "NTA. She was giving you unsolicited advice and is wrong about a lot of it. I don't blame you for snapping back at her. She needs to learn that her health and lifestyle is her own, and no one else's. No one likes unsolicited health advice like this.", "NTA one of my biggest pet peeves is when people give me health advice i never asked for.", "NTA, its very annoying when someone picks up a new healthy habit and needs to constantly remind the everyone about or turns it into their personality.\n\nThere is no ideal diet/exercise plan. Everyone just does the thing that suits them best.\n\nOfc, you're together so sometimes you'll share some of that stuff and advise eachother, but she can't call youan AH if youdon't want her advice, that's absurd.", "NTA.

I hate to say, \u2018if the genders were reversed\u2019 but\u2026if the genders would be reversed people would be talking about how absolutely unacceptable this is.\n\nMale athletes also experience body issues as well. Jesse Thomas, Ironman champion, has talked about this a lot. It\u2019s not okay to be food-policing, period, and her talk about estrogen is mildly annoying, to say the least. \n\nIt truly is classic beginner behavior, but you should hold your ground.

Also, she keeps giving you unsolicited advice that you've told her you don't appreciate. If you're a healthy dude and whatever you eat and do at the gym has been working out for u, i don't see a reason for her to try to change it. Every body is different and what works best for her might not work best for you and vice versa. I would keep an eye on her though, by the way she's behaving it sounds like she might develop some kind of eating disorder.", "NTA. Guys it\u2019s not a competition.

You both are failing to communicate with each other like kind, adult human beings should communicate.", "ESH\n\nActing like you know more than her is just as insufferable as she is being to you. Calling her a beginner is rude. \n\nIt sounds like you found a work out regime that works best for you and that's great. While your gfs behavior is a bit insufferable she's prolly doing it because 1. She loves you and wants you to live a long life and 2. Maybe this whole diet change is hard for _her_ and seeing you indulge yourself is making it harder for her to stay on track.\n\nRather than brushing her off why don't you both sit down and compare the diets you're doing and see if you can combine them together, that would be a more supportive way to deal with this conflict. The only thing I would say is fair to explain to her is someone who is genetically positioned to have high cholesterol does need to eat differently than someone who doesn't. Eat your egg yolks lol.\n\nBest if luck OP!", "And seems insufferable and is probably at risk of an eating disorder if she doesn\u2019t have one already.

Olympic lifters have the least occurrence of injuries of any professional athletes, and they lift way more than their body weight. \n\nEggs are a superfood.\n\nSoy Protein does suck though. The protein in soy has a low bioavailbility. Try hydrolysed beef protein or something else", ">I don't think she is qualified to give me advice.\n\nNAH. While your gf is certainly qualified to nag as befits your relationship status, she is not qualified to give medical advice for you based on medical advice she got from her doctor.\n\nMy main reason for voting NAH instead of not TA is because I believe you are erring in responding by brushing her off instead of bringing her into your confidence about the medical advice you are receiving, so that her nagging can be more valuable to you.", "NTA but you could have been a little less harsh.

You\u2019re both being condescending. Just agree to both just do what you do.", "YTA you both sound insufferable.

Your gf seems to simply be excited about taking care of her health and learning new things, and she's sharing it with you. You could continue passively saying you know what you're doing until you snap at her and call her a beginner and that you know more than her OR you could choose to be kind and appreciate her efforts. Instead respond, \"thanks for sharing your new knowledge and looking out for my health. This is my cheat treat for the week and I know it has high sugar. I'm going to get it anyway.\" If she continues to push things, then have a conversation where you calmly state your boundaries about food and that you will support her on her journey, but that you don't want her telling you what to eat or how to workout. If she disrespects these boundaries after you've calmly stated them, then that's a different issue.", "Your gf sounds annoying asf NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s fantastic that your gf is starting to become more conscious of being fit, and it\u2019s great she\u2019s gotten some education on how to do it properly. But it sounds like she believes she is suddenly an expert and is therefore qualified to give unsolicited advice. Tell her your appreciate her concerns, but you\u2019ve been working on fitness for a long time and you don\u2019t require any coaching.", "NTA.\n\nThis reminded me of my mum and I'm now triggered lol. She reads one article on the internet and thinks she knows enough to scold me on it. \n\nAre you healthy? Then keep doing what you are doing. She needs to stop projecting.", "Well the high cholesterol thing alone is a debunked bit of outdated science, so I will say NTA.", "NTA\n\nPeople oftentimes do this when they start learning about a new subject, cause they\u2019re excited and because the information is new to them, they assume it\u2019s new to everyone, not realizing reading nutrition labels and a healthy balance are something you\u2019re doing already.
