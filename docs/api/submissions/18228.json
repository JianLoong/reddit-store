She\u2019s very into spring cleaning and we\u2019re behind schedule so she figured I could start cleaning the attic as my punishment. \n\nMy old toys and dolls were up there, then boxes of stuff mom and dad packed up and didn\u2019t want downstairs. For my stuff, I was told to throw it out if I\u2019d never touch it again. For the rest, I was told to avoid my sister\u2019s (32f) stuff then to use my best judgment on the rest. If it hadn\u2019t been touched, toss it. If it was cool or interesting, keep it. When I was up there, when I finally started, a lot of it was stuff I\u2019d never seen. Old clothes, old decorations, lots of outdated things that could not even be called vintage. \n\nThree bags of trash later, I found boxes of boxes of photos that had been behind stuff. The layer of dust on them was an inch thick. Looking through, I saw some photos of people I didn\u2019t recognize, maybe a few of my sister when she was a kid. I went to ask my dad (52m) if he wanted them. I\u2019d asked him a few times about things. This time, he didn\u2019t come up and just said do whatever mom said. Because they hadn\u2019t been touched and I didn\u2019t recognize anyone, I threw most of them out. \n\nMy sister finally came home and it was her turn to go through the attic. She came running down about an hour later asking if we\u2019d moved her photo box. I said yeah and that they were gone. \n\nApparently, the wedding photos of her mom and my dad were in there as well as a lot of her mom\u2019s family photos. I didn\u2019t know and it didn\u2019t occur to me that that\u2019s what they were. I saw the wedding photos but didn\u2019t realize it was my dad. \n\nI feel really bad and she\u2019s calling me a little brat but I only did what mom and dad said. They\u2019re not mad at me but now she\u2019s mad at them. \n\nAITA for just doing what I was told?\n\nEDIT: to clear something up, i did pull out the photos that were obviously of my sister\n\nEDIT2: someone messaged me questions. my sister is my half sister. my dad married his first wife when he was nineteenish. she walked out on them. my sister was already out of the house at college when i was born.\n\nEDIT3: the box of photos was in a box of my dad\u2019s stuff. he came up for everything else i asked him about. those he didn\u2019t seem to have any interest in. i saved the pictures of my sister because i recognized my sister because of a birthmark. no one else was distinguishable \n\nEDIT4: i know i messed up because she\u2019s upset. my mom really just wanted to purge out the attic so we can move and dad didn\u2019t come upstairs to look at the photos. they were in his boxes and he said something about it being too much work to scan them. i told kat i\u2019m sorry and she told me she doesn\u2019t care. i didn\u2019t think it was a big deal because they were dad\u2019s photos and we don\u2019t put photos out in frames or anything because they\u2019re on their facebooks or i put mine on insta. \n\nEDIT5: i knew i was getting in trouble because i went to prom with my bf and he\u2019s 18 and my mom doesn\u2019t like him that much", "created_utc": 1685109554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13se0je/aita_for_cleaning_the_attic_as_told/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone - even 14 year olds - know that photos might be important to somebody. Getting rid of someone's sentimental baby blanket by accident is something I could understand, but *wedding photos*?

You were specifically told to avoid your sisters stuff.  When you found photos of your sister in there, you understood enough about what you\u2019d found to save those photos for her.

Using your judgement, you did what was asked, and consulted your father. No input, so you made your best guess. Likely, they should have instructed you to set aside the \u201ctrash\u201d so they could check through it before it was actually gone. \n\n14 year olds were born in 2009, photos taken in that lifetime are not irreplaceable- since everything was digital by then. \n\nThis points to the issue of having \u201cextremely important\u201d items that are being treated like garbage.
