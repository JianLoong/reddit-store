{"id": 15894, "submission_id": "131vkar", "title": "AITA for refusing to eat a \"smash cake\"?", "selftext": "Yesterday was my nephew's 1st birthday, and my sister and BIL had a little get together at their house. When it was time for cake, they brought out my nephew's \"smash cake\"\u2014exactly what it sounds, a cake for the baby to smash up and get icing all over themselves for cute pictures or whatever. \n\nI kind of imagined that it would be the size of a big cupcake, but they brought out a regular-sized round birthday cake. I just kind of figured they splurged and still expected the cake to just be for him to play around with. BUT. After my nephew had gone at this cake with his bare hands, and stuck his whole face in it, my sister started scooping up the mangled remains and distributing servings to everyone (just a handful of family members.) And everyone else was actually eating it!\n\nI declined because...seriously? I didn't want to eat something that has had a baby's grubby hands and body all over it, and I was surprised that anyone else did. My sister insisted I take a portion and I said \"Really, no, that's gross.\" Now...I probably wouldn't have used the word gross if I wasn't on the spot, but I was not at all prepared to have to politely decline to eat baby spit. My sister was very hurt by that and told me later (on a phone call that I thought was way longer than it needed to be for the severity of the infraction) that she thought I was being extremely judgemental, that it wasn't a big deal, we're all family, don't participate if I really don't want to but don't call her gross, etc.", "created_utc": 1682693913, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131vkar/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_a_smash_cake/", "score": 606, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

'We're all family' means nothing when it comes to germs.  And besides that, it *is* gross.  Maybe you could have phrased it better, but would she have accepted that or kept pushing until you had no choice but to say it anyway?", "NTA\n\nSmash cakes are supposed to be only for smashing and for the baby to eat. There is usually a second, non-smashed cake for adults to eat, or the adults are just adults about it and don't eat any cake.\n\nI've never heard of someone trying to serve a smashed cake to adults.", "NTA. So gross. And unbelievable that the others ate it. You spoke the truth.", "NTA, I have a 4 month old. His hands spend 70% of their existence in his mouth. That\u2019s a hard no from me, it is gross.

And for hilarious pictures. The guests have a sheet cake or cupcakes that is eaten. \n\nI would not eat my own childrens smash cakes, so I absolutely would not eat any other child's.", "NTA\n\nI thought that is kind of obvious? Baby gets a smash cake - of whatever size. Guests get a completely separate cake.\n\nAt least that's what I did. Baby got a sizeable smash cake - which was absolutely gross looking after they were done with it. Guests were served fresh cake from a completely separate cake that was made.\n\nI would absolutely not accept either - family or not. Ew.\n\nAlso, for those of you saying you that OP is the asshole here, they declined first.. only after it was insisted upon, did they make the \"gross\" comment - which, I feel, is reasonable at that point. It's reiterating \"I said no.\"", "NTA - It's extremely weird they didn't have 2 cakes (which is normal) a smaller one for baby to smash and a larger one for everyone else. When I worked at Safeway we'd make them for free with the purchase of a regular cake for 1 year old birthday parties as it's a normal thing to do.\n\nNo one wants to eat smooshed cake covered in baby drool, I think the most mind blowing thing to me is that you were the only one to **not** eat it. \n\nGross!", "NTA - a baby is a bundle of joy but they are crawling germ machines. They are always sticky in at least one place, especially around the nose and mouth. Anyone who\u2019s ever worked in a nursery or daycare knows there\u2019s pretty much a rolling cold/flu all year round bc germs flock to babies like moths to flames. I wouldn\u2019t even like sharing cutlery with a one year old.\n\nIt\u2019s insane your sister shared that cake with our people and even MORE insane that people ate it. Mother of god", "NTA that's so repulsive (because it's GROSS) that I actually gagged reading that someone expected you to eat the cake.", "OMG, no, You're NTA to me. I wouldn't eat this cake IF MY OWN CHILD did it. Someone else's kid? Please, it'd better be served on a stack of cash or with implied threats of death.", "100% NTA. \n\nA smash cake is for the child. There should have been a regular cake for consumption by the partygoers. It\u2019s ridiculous to think people, even if they are family, want to eat something another person has mangled. Also, kids hands are gross. Babies teeth and have their hands in their mouths all the time. \n\nI won\u2019t even eat little kids bday cakes where they just blow out candles. They spit all over them when they blow out the candles. It is gross.", "Nta. That IS gross!", "NTA. My godson turned one this past weekend and sneezed in my mouth.

There is absolutely no way I would eat something like that.  My niece's had their own smash cake that was made with less sugar.  And we have normal cake.", "You are supposed to get a second cake. Being related to someone doesn't magically release you from their germs. It may do the opposite if you both inherited a greater susceptibility to something. \n\nNTA.

The point of a smash cake is that it\u2019s NOT supposed the main cake, but rather a mini version or a cupcake. As the mom of a toddler\u2014can confirm, that\u2019s gross AF.", "NTA. That IS gross and she should have just left it when you declined the first time. \n\nNo is a complete sentence. You did nothing wrong after she refused to acknowledge your answer.", "NTA. A smash cake is supposed to be a small cake for the kid to destroy while eating with their hands. There should be another cake for everyone else. Does your sister not know that?", "NTA. That was gross. Children are Petri dishes for ever types of viruses and/bacteria out there. The polite thing to do is have a small smash cake for the baby and another cake for other guests. As for the others eating the cake that is their choice. So your choice to not eat it should be respected.", "> I said \"Really, no, that's gross.\"    \n\nNTA -  Ewwww. I've seen smash cakes a huge bunch of times and never once have I seen someone offer the smash cake to others. So not only is it gross it's also pretty fucking weird as well. Don't blame you for the gross part either, I`d react the same", "NTA.  A baby spit cake is gross.  (But next time I'd not say 'gross' right away.)", "NTA.  And ewww.", "NTA\n\nPlease show her this thread. That\u2019s so gross! Would she eat food that someone else had rubbed their hands, mouth, face and body all over?? Ewww no!\n\nJust cause it\u2019s a baby doesn\u2019t make it okay. \n\nIck!!!!!!", "Ew, gross! NTA", "So much NTA. I mean ewwwww, I wouldn't even eat my own children's Smash cake and I adore them to pieces! I suppose if one of them offered me a bite from their hands, as their mother, I'd eat it, but that would be the line I'd draw. LOL", "NTA and gross was very much the correct word to use in this situation because that is super gross", "NTA. Yes that is gross. Smash cakes are really not for eating...", "Ew. No. NTA. \n\nWe did a smash cake for both of my girls. They had a separate small cake. Everyone else got cake from a much larger cake. \n\nYou don\u2019t share the smash cake. That\u2019s gross. I wouldn\u2019t even eat something that\u2019s been touched and licked all over by my children, I\u2019m not gonna ask someone else too.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't eat it either.\n\nTypically the cake that is smashed is the kids and the adults/guests get another in my experience... or the cake is served and the kid can smash whatever is left.", "NTA. That's absolutely disgusting and your sister has a screw loose.", "NTA you could just explain that you didn\u2019t mean to come off harsh but it was on the spot and you were just shocked", "NTA. I've never seen anyone serve a smash cake to people.", "NTA. That IS gross.", "NTA.... that is not only gross but unhygienic.  She could have just cut him a piece or bought a cupcake.  I would not have ate it either.   I have never seen this before.  Hopefully I never do.", "NTA. That's disgusting. Next time she's over for dinner, serve a cake for desert but desecrate it first and then be upset when she doesn't want to eat it. Or maybe just scoop their pasta with your hands...", "I wouldn't have been able to hide my horrified reaction at her serving it after her baby put himself bodily in it. I'd be asking when I took crazy pills that I'm the odd one out. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\nThat is gross and my guess is your sister realized after you told her the truth that she messed up and is lashing out at you because she feels stupid she served baby snot cake to her guests.\n\nGuaranteed the other guests were also caught off guard and did not want to eat that cake but didn\u2019t have the guts to tell her.", "NTA. Mom of almost 4 boys and I wouldn\u2019t even eat that cake after one of my own children. That\u2019s fucking disgusting. A smash cake is completely separate from the cake you serve your guest. Truly I\u2019m gagging just thinking of anyone serving that shit to other people\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude02.", "NTA - that IS gross and someone needed to point it out. As other people have said, typically a smash cake is small or a cupcake or something like that and then there is another treat for guests.", "NTA. That's beyond gross.

Because i am a cranky old lady.", "NTA\n\nI have never heard of the smash cake being the same as THE cake either.\n\nIt has always been either a cupcake or a simple little 4 inch cake that just the baby gets to play with.\n\n\nUnless you are all in the same house hold, or atleast around each other a lot, immunities don't carry over easily regardless of blood relation.", "NTA, its fucking grim, good on you for not eating it", "NTA - it was gross.", "Nta they did that wrong. 100% of 1yr bday parties i have been to have exactly what you expected, a smaller cake for the kid to destroy then toss, and a secondary cake or cupcakes for guests.", "Omg the fact that people were actually eating it is just \ud83e\udd22 NTA!", "NTA eww", "NTA - Gross!!! What is wrong with people?  These \"Stupid Food\" trends have to stop.", "NTA What happened to the good old\" Don't play with your food\"?", "NTA. I've never heard of people serving the smash cake to others, is this common? I thought the smash cake was just for the baby, in my baby photos I had my own and everyone else had a separate cake!", "NTA, that IS gross.", "AAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\n\nNTA", "NTA that's gross. It's usually a cupcake as you stated or a smaller second cake. \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA. That is the definition of gross like it\u2019s cute for pictures, but no thanks I don\u2019t want to eat that.", "NTA -- A smash cake is actually supposed small cake for the exact reasons you stated. And yes it is gross to try to force your guests to eat anything someone put their face and hands all over.", "NTA Can someone please explain to me the common misconception that being family somehow spreads germs less? Idgaf family or not, I\u2019m not eating your spit cake.", "NTA \n\nIt is gross. I probably wouldn\u2019t of said that just declined it. \nBut normally people do just a separate cake for kid to enjoy then another for the actual guests.", "NTA I have never heard of anyone using a smash cake for anyone other than the birthday child.", "NTA The smash cake is for photos, and there should be a real cake for everyone else!", "NTA, I would not eat this! There could be snot and germs on the cake!", "We did a smash cake for my son when he turned 1. I absolutely would not have served my guests the leftovers. That\u2019s weird, cheap, and gross. \n\nNTA.", "NTA times million!!!! I'm a mom, and even I find this gross.  We did the smash cake thing. It was strictly for the kid.  Had little cakes for others.  It would be gross if it were an adult, teen, etc.  Doesn't matter.  You declined politely to start, and then your sister insisted. That's when you used the word gross, which I get.  You were put on the spot and couldn't think of a more polite way to answer.  I'd rather someone be honest like this than to beat around the bush to be polite.", "NTA. Germs are real. And that\u2019s just gross.", "First thing I thought was, \u201cThat\u2019s gross!\u201d NTA", "NTA...Would your sister eat a cake you had slobbered over and pulled apart with your hands? Not likely.  She would probably also find the suggestion to be gross. It may be fun to watch a baby pull a cake apart, but it's no less gross to eat the remains.  You likely only said what others were thinking.", "NTA. That *IS* just gross. Yeah, you could've been more polite, but I would also be too shocked to say anything remotely polite when confronted with that situation. Eew.", "You don\u2019t have to eat anything that\u2019s offered.\nThey should graciously accept the word \u201cno.\u201d\nNTA", "NTA.  You didn't actually insult them or their baby, you just pointed out that eating cake that a baby had already played in is gross.  I get it.  You didn't say the baby was gross, just the cake. \n\nYou CHOSE to not eat the cake, you didn't prevent others from eating it or, I'm assuming, make a big stink over it.  You just said, \"Really, no, that's gross.\"  \n\nMaybe she's just a bit overemotional since it's her son's first birthday (understandable), but just because it is a special occasion does not mean that you have to eat baby spit lol. \n\nI hope you all were able to work it out.  I'm sure the baby looked adorable and had fun smashing his cake, but I'm with ya, I wouldn't have eaten it either!", "Smash cakes are dumb.

NTA", "NTA - we are living in a post pandemic world and the parents served a cake that a baby mangled?!?!  Babies are cute but I\u2019ve also had the worst stomach viruses ever from what my kids brought home from daycare.  \n\nIt isn\u2019t impolite to indicate the truth in this situation. Eating food that has been completely torn asunder by another human\u2019s unwashed hands, face and saliva is, in fact, gross.  Unless that baby was following the food safety guidelines we establish in restaurants, (which come on, we know isn\u2019t possible) then OP\u2019s description isn\u2019t rude.  It\u2019s true.

Your nephew should have had his own smaller cake to smash. Someone messed up.", "NTA. Both when my niece and nephew turned 1, they both had a smash cake for themselves, BUT there were cupcakes and other treats for everyone else.

Every person I\u2019ve known gave ONE piece of cake to their baby on their birthday (or had a much smaller cake for the baby and a larger one for everyone else) so they could smush it and have pictures taken of their cake covered body. Everyone gets to coo over the baby being silly AND the guests get to eat the rest of the cake which is non-tainted. I know \u201csmash cakes\u201d are a thing but I don\u2019t think anyone else does it this way", "NTA.  If someone wants to do a smash cake, just get a two-tier.  The baby can smash up / eat the small tier, and the guests eat the undefiled base.  Not wanting to eat the baby's leftovers is normal, and your sister shouldn't have been mad at you for that.", "NTA. That is disgusting. I mean, I've eaten stuff from MY babies. But they're my babies, it's different. I love cake smash photos. I think they're adorable, but most people get a cheap cake to smoosh and another one to actually eat.", "I felt like the tiny smash cake was wasteful so I got a standard cake and had my kid smash a slice. Got plenty of messy cake pictures, didn't throw away cake, didn't make anyone eat baby spit. There are other options. I get why she was upset you said ew. People aren't rational about their kids. It'd be nice if you said sorry for the way you worded it, but definitely NTA for refusing it.", "Nta- smash cakes are supposed to be miniature cakes meant for the baby only. I have NEVER seen one served afterwards. When my oldest turned 1 and we got her bday cake the baker actually included the smash cake for free if I bought a whole sheet cake.", "Ew NTA", "Yuck. NTA", "NTA. That is disgusting. It is totally unusual to have a smash cake be that large. You\u2019re right it\u2019s usually something tiny and then others eat a non germ filled cake.

You passed!", "NTA and I\u2019m glad you told her it was gross. I can\u2019t believe other people were eating it.

When someone pushes the bounds of normal behavior; you can push back and say no. \n\nSome people will take offence to being called gross...but sometimes its called for. Eating another persons spit is a great way to catch disease's; every parent knows that. We all get sick regularly from our direct kids. \n\nPurposefully telling your brother its okay, because we're family; isn't true unless you actually live with the family and regularly catch their diseases.", "NTA\n\n>don't participate if I really don't want to\n\nYou literally declined once and it was pushed, did she expect you to magically change your mind on a spit cake?", "NTA. Everyone knows you don\u2019t eat the smash cake, or at least I thought everyone knew that. You\u2019re right that IS gross and I wouldn\u2019t eat it either.", "NTA. Super gross.

I wouldn\u2019t even eat cake my own baby had smashed up, let alone somebody else\u2019s baby.\n\nI hate cake smashes for this exact reason - it\u2019s such a massive waste of cake!", "This made me feel sick. NTA", "NTA in the slightest. That's disgusting, and calling it \"gross\" was putting it mildly.\n\nIt's not about the aesthetics, it's about the extreme lack of hygiene.

It sounds like you only called it gross when she persisted. That's on her.", "NTA\n\nI would have suddenly become diabetic and unable to eat the cake. That's just gross. \n\nMakes me wonder if your sister would have actually eaten smash cake at another child's birthday as well. I think not.", "NTA - you wouldn't be expected to eat a wedding cake that your drunk uncle smashed his face into, or a birthday cake your cat decided to sit on. So how is this any different just because it is a baby? \n\nAnd, you're also NTA for pointing out that it is gross and not eating it. I'm surprised everyone else did eat it \ud83e\udd22 \n\nJust don't let this come between you and your sister, though, it's not worth it.", "NTA, at all! You politely said no and then your sister pushed, it's not unreasonable to not want to eat the smashed up cake, you're right it is gross!", "NTA. That is gross. I just did a 1st birthday party for my son and he got a smash cake all to himself and everyone else got cupcakes.", "Nta. She pushed you so you blurted outa reason, and a valid reason at that. You have a separate cake to serve guests. Stick to your guns. I would\u2019ve used far fouler language if my sister pulled any of that, especially the phone call.", "NTA. You are correct - that is gross.", "NTA I have never ever heard of anyone eating the smash cake.", "NTA yeah that\u2019s really gross.", "No, that's weird and most photos of smash cakes have them as smaller cakes. Bigger than a big cupcake, but definitely not the cake you'd serve to the rest of the party. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s customary to have an additional cake or cupcakes to serve to guests. \nI\u2019ll also add, in our family we are very blunt so to say \u201cit\u2019s gross\u201d would not be inappropriate or surprising. \nAdditionally, my granddaughter literally drools in my mouth and I still would not eat a cake that she has smashed, drooled in, eaten and then spit back out.", "The imagery of that actually made me feel unwell. Almost threw up. Not touching the cake was warranted, and you were right by calling it out as gross. NTA", "NTA. Bacteria and viruses don\u2019t care if you\u2019re family. There are lots of \u201clittle kid\u201d illnesses that absolutely cripple adults. How\u2019s a little hand foot and mouth disease sound?  Not great. Of course with little kids there is always the chance of passing infections around because they slobber, have accidents, shove their hands into your eyeballs, etc. I love my niece and nephew more than anything and eating a cake they literally smashed with their hands and slobbered all over sounds like purposely trying to get whatever sickness is floating around their daycare.", "Nta. I'm surprised others ate it. I think it's normal to have a different cake for the quest", "NTA vile.", "NTA, but if they are first time parents, just give them another few years to get over this period. After having my first child, it was probably 1.5 years before I realized how ugly her first years' photos were, how gross she was, and how she is not the center of everyone else's universe.  At this point, your sister and BIL can't imagine why everyone else wouldn't enjoy eating stuff their precious baby drooled all over. \n\nEating a smash cake is disgusting and I've been around some of these 1 year old parties, and nobody serves that to guests. There is supposed to be a second cake. It is so gross to expect people to eat the smash cake.", "NTA that's nasty. My baby cousin had a smash \"cake\" for her first birthday. It was a small slice of her birthday cake, smaller than the slices the guests eat. She ate most of it, and her mom ate the rest.", "NTA. The point of a smash cake is for just the baby lol. This is one of the weirdest things I\u2019ve heard in awhile", "They are supposed to get a small round cake for the baby to smash and a sheet cake to cut for everyone else that matches!!!! WTf , that is so gross!  I would have been mortified by everyone eating it.  you are NTA", "NTA\nIt\u2019s super gross", "NTA.

As a parent I get that your kids germs aren\u2019t gross to you, but they\u2019re still gross to everyone else. If your sister didn\u2019t insist you took a scoop of chewed up cake, you wouldn\u2019t have said it was gross.", "Ew! I gagged just thinking about this. My daughter is 2 and when she turned 1 she had her own tiny cake to smash up and everyone else was served from a separate sheet cake. Who would ever think it's ok to serve someone a gross baby snot cake? No thanks!\n\nNTA", "NTA. I will be laughing about this for a long time. That\u2019s really the grossest thing I have heard in a while. And everyone eating that cake is just as looney as your sister.", "NTA. I baked my daughters smash cake myself and it left about a dozen cupcakes for family. Then I bought a $20 cookie cake just incase. I have a kid and I do NOT EAT OR DRINK after her.

Family or not.", "I think they didn\u2019t understand that you\u2019re supposed to get a little tiny cake for them to smash lol NTA", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe anyone ate that cake. Yuck!", "NTA. I'm not a fan of smash cakes to begin with, but I thought they were for the baby alone and a different cake was offered for guest consumption. \n\nThing is, babies are sticky, they drool and have no clue about hygiene. After the whole Covid situation, one would think people are more conscious of germs and would be wary of eating food smeared all over another person. Apparently not. Do these people change the baby on the table at restaurants too?", "NTA. I never knew this was a thing. The wording may have been harsh, but it was 100% accurate. Babies can be gross with all the drool and germy hands. While this is cute for the parents and/or from a distance, no one should be obligated to eat mashed up cake with a side of baby spit no matter how much you love the baby. \n\nYou can love something AND not want to eat its spit. I bet most people ate because they felt too awkward and put on the spot to reject it. Show your sis this thread. She needs a reality check.", "NTA. You\u2019re supposed to have a separate cake for smashing and another for actually eating lol wth.", "NTA.\nEwww. Heck no would I eat any baby's smash cake.

When it was time for cake, they brought out my nephew's \"smash cake\"\u2014exactly what it sounds, a cake for the baby to smash up and get icing all over themselves for cute pictures or whatever. \n\nI kind of imagined that it would be the size of a big cupcake, but they brought out a regular-sized round birthday cake. I just kind of figured they splurged and still expected the cake to just be for him to play around with. BUT. After my nephew had gone at this cake with his bare hands, and stuck his whole face in it, my sister started scooping up the mangled remains and distributing servings to everyone (just a handful of family members.) And everyone else was actually eating it!\n\nI declined because...seriously? I didn't want to eat something that has had a baby's grubby hands and body all over it, and I was surprised that anyone else did. My sister insisted I take a portion and I said \"Really, no, that's gross.\" Now...I probably wouldn't have used the word gross if I wasn't on the spot, but I was not at all prepared to have to politely decline to eat baby spit. My sister was very hurt by that and told me later (on a phone call that I thought was way longer than it needed to be for the severity of the infraction) that she thought I was being extremely judgemental, that it wasn't a big deal, we're all family, don't participate if I really don't want to but don't call her gross, etc.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
