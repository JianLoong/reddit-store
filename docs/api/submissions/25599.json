He has a ten year old son from his previous marriage and I love him a lot, my husband splits custody with his ex-wife 50/50 with them alternating weeks. They have been in talks about my Stepsons education for a while as he doesn't thrive in a traditional schooling environment and they want to homeschool him. If done right I don't see an issue with this even though I do have concerns about his social needs. I expressed those thoughts but beyond that I didn't offer much input, he's their son and his education is up to them.\n\nI had an issue however when they seemed to think that I could oversee his education when he's staying with his father and I. They even commented how i'm always home so it's perfect, I work remotely as a Data Analyst so yes i'm around but i'm working and not free to play teacher. Helping with homework outside of work is fine but actually teaching? that's not my job. I told them as much and said if they want to do this either his mum will have to come round during my work hours or they'll have to hire a tutor as I won't be splitting my focus between teaching him and my job, I even told them i'd be happy to put money towards the tutor. \n\nThey feel i'm being unreasonable and his ex-wife even questioned if I see their son as my family if i've got so little interest in his schooling and what is best for him. This led to harsh words said on both sides, my husband actually took her side in this and has told me he's disappointed in me, that it's not like his son is a little kid who'll be underfoot constantly and surely the point of remote working is that I can have a balance to help out around the home, I suggested if he felt that way maybe he should see about working remotely. \n\nI feel pretty shit about this, I love my stepson and I want a good future for him and for an education he thrives in but I don't see why it's down to me to educate him when I work fulltime even if that work is from home. My husband is currently really upset with me and the fact they're both in agreement in this is making me question if i'm in the wrong and being an asshole.\n\nEdit: I'd like to be clear, they could in theory homeschool him properly this isn't something they're wanting to do with no experience. His ex-wife is a former teacher but had to leave her job due to her health.\n\nUPDATE: Hi everyone, sorry i've not been answering messages/very responsive on here. A few hours after this post went up my Husband and I got into a huge fight and I brought up this post and some of the answers which led to him being angry that i'd shared our business online. I ended up packing up my stuff and after a few texts I arranged to go stay with my brother and his husband. I've told my Husband he needs to sort his shit out and figure out an arrangement that doesn't involve me before I come home and even then I won't be back until he agrees to counselling together.", "created_utc": 1693114896, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162hwm6/aita_for_telling_my_husband_and_his_exwife_that/", "score": 5406, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can't expect you to do two jobs at the exact same time. \n\nHe and his wife are completely unreasonable and have no respect for your work.

Remote work is still 100% just that: WORK. Those who work remotely *still have to complete the hours and work.* But somehow, people feel that remote workers can multi-task and also accomplish all the household chores, are eating bon-bons while watching the Price is Right, and I guess homeschool a child too. Nope. You're still in a cubicle working those hours, the cubicle is just your home office as you define it. There is no way the OP can also be a full time teacher on the days her step child is there.

I think you\u2019ve done very well sticking up for yourself, just because you work from home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re sitting around doing nothing all day. You need to focus on work, and son needs to focus on school. If it was as simple as kids teaching themselves we wouldn\u2019t have teacher shortages, and everyone would be homeschooling. Teaching is hard. Talk to a tutor, or another parent who homeschools and get their daily lesson plan/schedule and practice/ show your husband some weekend. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. It\u2019s a whole lifestyle change and depending on where you live it can be really hard. In my area there\u2019s not a lot of activities for kids outside of school, so the social development part is a big factor. I know parents who homeschool and I\u2019ve talked to their kids. Every single one has told me that while they love school from home it does make it difficult for them to meet friends and keep relationships with friends. I know this has a lot to do with our small town and lack of resources all around, and these kids are thriving in spite of it. But it\u2019s not something I would choose to do for my own children, it\u2019s too much work and not enough socialization.
