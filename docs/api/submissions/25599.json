He has a ten year old son from his previous marriage and I love him a lot, my husband splits custody with his ex-wife 50/50 with them alternating weeks. They have been in talks about my Stepsons education for a while as he doesn't thrive in a traditional schooling environment and they want to homeschool him. If done right I don't see an issue with this even though I do have concerns about his social needs. I expressed those thoughts but beyond that I didn't offer much input, he's their son and his education is up to them.\n\nI had an issue however when they seemed to think that I could oversee his education when he's staying with his father and I. They even commented how i'm always home so it's perfect, I work remotely as a Data Analyst so yes i'm around but i'm working and not free to play teacher. Helping with homework outside of work is fine but actually teaching? that's not my job. I told them as much and said if they want to do this either his mum will have to come round during my work hours or they'll have to hire a tutor as I won't be splitting my focus between teaching him and my job, I even told them i'd be happy to put money towards the tutor. \n\nThey feel i'm being unreasonable and his ex-wife even questioned if I see their son as my family if i've got so little interest in his schooling and what is best for him. This led to harsh words said on both sides, my husband actually took her side in this and has told me he's disappointed in me, that it's not like his son is a little kid who'll be underfoot constantly and surely the point of remote working is that I can have a balance to help out around the home, I suggested if he felt that way maybe he should see about working remotely. \n\nI feel pretty shit about this, I love my stepson and I want a good future for him and for an education he thrives in but I don't see why it's down to me to educate him when I work fulltime even if that work is from home. My husband is currently really upset with me and the fact they're both in agreement in this is making me question if i'm in the wrong and being an asshole.\n\nEdit: I'd like to be clear, they could in theory homeschool him properly this isn't something they're wanting to do with no experience.

Homeschooling is a significant time investment, if done right.\n\nEdit: if he's not thriving in traditional schooling, he's unlikely to thrive in a situation where he's supposed to be working independently, supervised by someone who is distracted by having another full-time job they are doing at the time.", "NTA. Teaching is a full-time job. You already have a full-time job that takes up your daytime hours. Working from home doesn't mean you have time to take on a new full-time job. If your husband wants his son homeschooled so badly, but doesn't want to hire a tutor, he can quit his own job and teach. He can't expect you to do two jobs at the exact same time. \n\nHe and his wife are completely unreasonable and have no respect for your work. You are effectively \"at work\" during all the hours you are working. This is next-level insanity.", "NTA. You are being honest about what you are able to do. In this case, loving your stepson is saying \"no\" to what you cannot realistically take on. \n\nI taught 10 year olds for over a decade and homeschooled 4 of my own children. **Homeschooling a grade-school child and doing it well is a huge commitment, not something that can be managed along with a full-time WFH job.** Why do the parents want to \"homeschool\" this boy if nobody has the time to actually do it?", "NTA. Remote work is still 100% just that: WORK. Those who work remotely *still have to complete the hours and work.* But somehow, people feel that remote workers can multi-task and also accomplish all the household chores, are eating bon-bons while watching the Price is Right, and I guess homeschool a child too. Nope. You're still in a cubicle working those hours, the cubicle is just your home office as you define it. There is no way the OP can also be a full time teacher on the days her step child is there. And the bio parents should understand it would not be in the interest of the child in any way for this to happen.", "NTA. His educational need is theirs to figure out.

They need to calm the fuck down a bit. Also, there\u2019s another parent in this household that needs to step up. Show your husband this post and the replies to it. The burden for this should not be on you just because you work from home. Furthermore, a lot of employers frown on this very thing.

By no means TA. \n\nSpeaking as someone who was home educated for a time, it destroyed my parents relationship because they both had to do it alongside working, so they were always tired and stressed and never had time for themselves. Your husband and his ex are about to enter a world of pain I wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy and I absolutely do not blame you for wanting out of that. \n\nThe offer to pay for tuition is not only generous but sensible, because people who aren\u2019t trained as teachers are going to find it hard to get a kid through a comparable education, trust the guy with three(3) GCSEs.", "NTA\nYou are working, not playing around the house. It's not up to you to educate him, you also suggested a tutor so it's not true you don't care about his education. They put you in the corner making you think you are the AHole and that's wrong.

They can't have it both ways.\n\nBTW, your husband isn't really on his ex wife's side. He's on the side of 'not wanting to do the job himself' and they currently align.\n\nOne more thing.

I think you\u2019ve done very well sticking up for yourself, just because you work from home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re sitting around doing nothing all day. You need to focus on work, and son needs to focus on school. If it was as simple as kids teaching themselves we wouldn\u2019t have teacher shortages, and everyone would be homeschooling. Teaching is hard. Talk to a tutor, or another parent who homeschools and get their daily lesson plan/schedule and practice/ show your husband some weekend. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. It\u2019s a whole lifestyle change and depending on where you live it can be really hard. In my area there\u2019s not a lot of activities for kids outside of school, so the social development part is a big factor. I know parents who homeschool and I\u2019ve talked to their kids. Every single one has told me that while they love school from home it does make it difficult for them to meet friends and keep relationships with friends. I know this has a lot to do with our small town and lack of resources all around, and these kids are thriving in spite of it. But it\u2019s not something I would choose to do for my own children, it\u2019s too much work and not enough socialization. Not wanting to work a full time job And teach a 10 year old from home doesn\u2019t mean you love him any less, or that you don\u2019t think of him as your son.

You seem to be the only one thinking in terms of real life logistics. All they're thinking about is how \"great\" this is going to be. They view it as part of custody/care, but it's not, it's a job. Mom doesn't get a \"week off\", mom's got a new full time job. Just because your stepson won't be at her house, doesn't mean she isn't still responsible for the job.

What's wrong with one of them doing it on their time it's not about love they just trying to gaslight you into doing their job no, it's no you have a job other obligations they trying to pass the love card to get with what they want. I wouldn't tolerate it.", "Tell your husband you will be part of your stepson's education by dropping him off and picking him up from his mom's every school day. Mom can teach him and take him out on educational field trips with other home schooled children. He will have consistent education plus the benefit of socializing.", "NTA. The ex was a *teacher*? Who is better qualified to do home schooling?", "erm", "NTA I\u2019ll preface this by saying that your husbands ex-wife has no right to tell you what to do with your time in your home with your stepson. What happens under your roof is the concern of you and your husband alone, unless obviously the ex-wife thought there was some kind of abuse or some other harm happening, which obviously isn\u2019t the case.\n\nAlthough that being said, from your own wording, I do seem to agree that you may not be all in on this kid like you maybe think you are. Referring to him as \u201ctheir son\u201d and saying \u201chis education is up to them\u201d really makes it seem like you don\u2019t look at him as your own child, at least not fully. As his stepmom you are just as responsible for his well-being and education as his biological parents. You chose this family, you married into this family, you live under the same roof as this family. You don\u2019t get to be only half in on anything that has to do with that child and his upbringing.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you should have to devote all this time to homeschooling him, especially if it\u2019s not something you want to do. It\u2019s unreasonable to put that kind of pressure on you given that you work full time as it is. This is a conversation you need to have with your husband so you can work out something that works for the both of you. If that means you need to get a tutor, that\u2019s better than you being pushed into being his full time teacher and developing resentment for being overworked from having to both work full time and teach full time.\n\nDo better putting yourself in the parent role for that child though.

You have a job, and homeschooling someone isn't the same as babysitting them, at least not if you want to do it well or do it right. Your husband wants the control of homeschooling but none of the responsibility of doing the actual work.", "You have a much bigger problem here.\n\nYour husband doesn't understand that **working remotely is still a full-time job for you**. That you are supposed to be *working* during your assigned hours, and not spending time caring for or teaching a child.\n\nIf you've been doing some childcare/parenting activities with your stepson during your working hours, that's why he regards your time as \"free\", and it needs to stop. Tell your husband that during his custody weeks, he needs to arrange for a nanny or childminder for any hours that you are supposed to be working. Stepson comes home from school at 3pm and you're on work until 5? He needs to hire a babysitter for those hours, or arrange for an after-school program.\n\nGood luck with this, it's going to be hard after you've spent years letting him think that you have free time during the day. You may need to consider going back to the office to work; otherwise, you are going to continue to be regarded as a free babysitter and tutor.", "Omg covid destroyed me. My little one was only 4 but trying to work ft and watch him and teach him was challenging. It's hard enough wfh with them here during school holidays", "Yep, she\u2019s the one who wants to move this forward. If she wants it to work so badly, she should be covering the homeschooling 100% of the time and not putting the burden on you.", "Can his dad drop him off at his mom's home for school?", "Oh, absolutely. That's a perfectly reasonable and accommodating alternative. She will have to become familiar with his entire curriculum, evaluate all his work and track his progress anyway, no reason for you to have to do it too. \n\nWhich is to say, any quality homeschooling takes familiarity with the material and the child's skill, preparation and hands-on involvement, which the ex-wife is well aware of. I might explain to her that while her extensive professional experience makes it easy for her to teach children, it might also lead her to underestimate the amount of effort it would take you to learn all of this, teach your stepson and work your actual full time job, which is somewhat involved in its own right.", "This is the answer. Half the time he's homeschooled. Half the time he's being dropped off at \"the school of mum\".\n\nAlthough before they hit the button they've tried everything to keep him in regular school? Could the money spent on homeschooling be used for some extra tutoring? Therapies?", "Yes, this is it. OP is NTA, and homeschooling is done at Mom's house."]}
