He has a ten year old son from his previous marriage and I love him a lot, my husband splits custody with his ex-wife 50/50 with them alternating weeks. They have been in talks about my Stepsons education for a while as he doesn't thrive in a traditional schooling environment and they want to homeschool him. If done right I don't see an issue with this even though I do have concerns about his social needs. I expressed those thoughts but beyond that I didn't offer much input, he's their son and his education is up to them.\n\nI had an issue however when they seemed to think that I could oversee his education when he's staying with his father and I. They even commented how i'm always home so it's perfect, I work remotely as a Data Analyst so yes i'm around but i'm working and not free to play teacher. Helping with homework outside of work is fine but actually teaching? that's not my job. I told them as much and said if they want to do this either his mum will have to come round during my work hours or they'll have to hire a tutor as I won't be splitting my focus between teaching him and my job, I even told them i'd be happy to put money towards the tutor. \n\nThey feel i'm being unreasonable and his ex-wife even questioned if I see their son as my family if i've got so little interest in his schooling and what is best for him. This led to harsh words said on both sides, my husband actually took her side in this and has told me he's disappointed in me, that it's not like his son is a little kid who'll be underfoot constantly and surely the point of remote working is that I can have a balance to help out around the home, I suggested if he felt that way maybe he should see about working remotely. \n\nI feel pretty shit about this, I love my stepson and I want a good future for him and for an education he thrives in but I don't see why it's down to me to educate him when I work fulltime even if that work is from home. My husband is currently really upset with me and the fact they're both in agreement in this is making me question if i'm in the wrong and being an asshole.\n\nEdit: I'd like to be clear, they could in theory homeschool him properly this isn't something they're wanting to do with no experience.

He can't expect you to do two jobs at the exact same time. \n\nHe and his wife are completely unreasonable and have no respect for your work.

In this case, loving your stepson is saying \"no\" to what you cannot realistically take on. \n\nI taught 10 year olds for over a decade and homeschooled 4 of my own children. **Homeschooling a grade-school child and doing it well is a huge commitment, not something that can be managed along with a full-time WFH job.** Why do the parents want to \"homeschool\" this boy if nobody has the time or ability to actually do it?\n\nEdit: added \"ability\" to last sentence.", "NTA. Remote work is still 100% just that: WORK. Those who work remotely *still have to complete the hours and work.* But somehow, people feel that remote workers can multi-task and also accomplish all the household chores, are eating bon-bons while watching the Price is Right, and I guess homeschool a child too. Nope. You're still in a cubicle working those hours, the cubicle is just your home office as you define it. There is no way the OP can also be a full time teacher on the days her step child is there. And the bio parents should understand it would not be in the interest of the child in any way for this to happen.", "NTA. His educational need is theirs to figure out.

By no means TA. \n\nSpeaking as someone who was home educated for a time, it destroyed my parents relationship because they both had to do it alongside working, so they were always tired and stressed and never had time for themselves. Your husband and his ex are about to enter a world of pain I wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy and I absolutely do not blame you for wanting out of that. \n\nThe offer to pay for tuition is not only generous but sensible, because people who aren\u2019t trained as teachers are going to find it hard to get a kid through a comparable education, trust the guy with three(3) GCSEs.", "NTA\nYou are working, not playing around the house.

Don't they think he's part of the family? Then dump their arses. They are treating you appallingly. They are gaslighting you. They are abusing your good nature. And it's only going to get worse. Screw them.", "Ex was a teacher? Fantastic. She can do it when he\u2019s with her. When he\u2019s in your care, he can go to her house during the day, so she can teach him.

I think you\u2019ve done very well sticking up for yourself, just because you work from home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re sitting around doing nothing all day. You need to focus on work, and son needs to focus on school. If it was as simple as kids teaching themselves we wouldn\u2019t have teacher shortages, and everyone would be homeschooling. Teaching is hard. Talk to a tutor, or another parent who homeschools and get their daily lesson plan/schedule and practice/ show your husband some weekend. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. It\u2019s a whole lifestyle change and depending on where you live it can be really hard. In my area there\u2019s not a lot of activities for kids outside of school, so the social development part is a big factor. I know parents who homeschool and I\u2019ve talked to their kids. Every single one has told me that while they love school from home it does make it difficult for them to meet friends and keep relationships with friends. I know this has a lot to do with our small town and lack of resources all around, and these kids are thriving in spite of it. But it\u2019s not something I would choose to do for my own children, it\u2019s too much work and not enough socialization. Not wanting to work a full time job And teach a 10 year old from home doesn\u2019t mean you love him any less, or that you don\u2019t think of him as your son.

You seem to be the only one thinking in terms of real life logistics. All they're thinking about is how \"great\" this is going to be. They view it as part of custody/care, but it's not, it's a job. Mom doesn't get a \"week off\", mom's got a new full time job. Just because your stepson won't be at her house, doesn't mean she isn't still responsible for the job.

Who is better qualified to do home schooling?", "erm", "NTA I\u2019ll preface this by saying that your husbands ex-wife has no right to tell you what to do with your time in your home with your stepson. What happens under your roof is the concern of you and your husband alone, unless obviously the ex-wife thought there was some kind of abuse or some other harm happening, which obviously isn\u2019t the case.\n\nAlthough that being said, from your own wording, I do seem to agree that you may not be all in on this kid like you maybe think you are. Referring to him as \u201ctheir son\u201d and saying \u201chis education is up to them\u201d really makes it seem like you don\u2019t look at him as your own child, at least not fully. As his stepmom you are just as responsible for his well-being and education as his biological parents. You chose this family, you married into this family, you live under the same roof as this family. You don\u2019t get to be only half in on anything that has to do with that child and his upbringing.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you should have to devote all this time to homeschooling him, especially if it\u2019s not something you want to do. It\u2019s unreasonable to put that kind of pressure on you given that you work full time as it is. This is a conversation you need to have with your husband so you can work out something that works for the both of you. If that means you need to get a tutor, that\u2019s better than you being pushed into being his full time teacher and developing resentment for being overworked from having to both work full time and teach full time.\n\nDo better putting yourself in the parent role for that child though.
