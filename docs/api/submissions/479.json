So, if a name is, by their words, a symbol of connection to family, the problem kinda solves itself.\n\nNta", "NTA. So far, none of my kids are trans so I don't know what my opinion on this is worth. One of my kids has expressed a desire to change their name when they reach adulthood. It does make me a little sad because I gave them their name, but that is a ME problem. If they still want to change it when they are an adult, I will help them do that. They are the one that has to live with their name.", "I don't even have to read your story. No, you're not. It's your name. You can change it to whatever you want at any point.", "NTA. Sure, blood is thicker than water when they twist the idiom to their needs. The full phrase is \"the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.\" \n\nYour identity is only tied to the name as far as you let it be. Clearly you are not the name they gave you, and you recognize that in yourself, and now you've chosen a name that shines like a beacon in the emotional hellscape that is \"finding yourself.\" They gifted you a name at birth and now it is time for you to gift one to yourself. Consider it self care. \n\nI'm 36 and for my 37th birthday, I'm gifting myself a new name. It's already the name I use and it fits me so much better than the original. It's more who I am than the name I used for twenty some-odd years. You're not the asshole. You're becoming who you are.", "NTA. It's not surprising that people would react strongly, people attach a lot of emotion to names - your birth name is strongly attached to who you are as a person in the minds of your family members, and it's difficult for them to dissociate you as a person from your name. That being said, it's particularly difficult to deal with those issues with conservative families, so I wish you the best of luck. Ultimately you deserve a name that you feel comfortable with.", "NTA. I\u2019m FTM. I\u2019ve changed my name 4 different times. I took Jonathan because my mom would have named me that if I was born male. It never stuck with me. About half a year later I added Jaxon as a middle name and asked to be called that. People still used my old female name and then also Jonathan. It was a big pain in the ass. \n\nEventually, 7 years later I dropped Jonathan all together when I got married, and took my last name and my wife\u2019s. \n\nBtw I also changed my last name initially. I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged to the \u201cSolis\u201d family in the sense that I wanted to create my new family. Because Mexican culture is so sexist and I wanted to create my own family line. Mind you my family is fucking amazing. \n\nPeople will judge you for any little thing that bothers them. It speaks more about weird internalized insecurities and a general lack of respect for others regardless of xyz.\n\nEdit: congrats on finding a name, it\u2019s a small but weirdly significant part of your identity(:", "NTA \n\nYou are an adult. It is your name. It is perfectly reasonable to choose a name that suits your identity.\n\nAs parents, we do our best to name our infants. But, honestly, we don't know them. That's part of the reason that so many people end up with nicknames, regardless of their gender identity. Their gives name doesn't suit them.\n\nYour gives name doesn't suit you. You are not the person that the name was assigned to. You are you.  You're an adult. Change your name.\n\nYour family will adjust, or they won't. But you will be free of that name. The name that was never you. You will have a new name. A name that feels right. A name that makes you proud. A name that makes you feel comfortable. A name that makes you feel more confident. A name that fits.", "Nta-i'm so sorry.my gosh your family is cruel put stop and think. My favorite author said it's not what you call me but what I answer to that matters", "NTA. You need to change your name, unless you have one of those names that are unisex. It seems to me that your problem with your name is the smallest part of your problem with your family.", "NTA", "NTA at all. Good on you for changing your name to something that empowers you to live your truest self. I\u2019m sorry how your family is reacting and treating you\u2014they are AH", "NTA. I'm sorry your family is not supportive. That's really shitty and has to be extremely hard to deal with. I hope you have friends and other people that are supportive. Those people will be your real family. My friend that happens to be trans posted something recently that basically said a parent names you when you don't have a voice, but now that you have found your voice it's up to you to tell the world who you are. It's really unfortunate that your family has not opened their minds/hearts to the person you *truely* are, and maybe their negativity is something you decide you don't need to be part of your life. Surround yourself with people that support who for who you really are.", "NTA. They say that family is important and blood is blood, but they're unwilling to accept you for who you are despite the whole family blood blah blah blah.\n\nThey don't care about family.

May I ask is your family supportive of your decision of transition? I am asking because you say they are heavily Christian and Conservative. I see this as a new beginning as well. Many people change their names when they get married. It used to be certain religious took a different name when they made their final vows erasing their old life and committing to their new one. I personally see no difference in your choice. And I should have said NTA.", "INFO: Last name, first name, or both? I have a gay sister and a very conservative family who loves her very much. It would break our hearts if she changed her last name for any reason other than marriage.", "Change your name!   One of my kids is trans.  We all lucked out, in that she likes her nickname.  It always suited her, and she likes it.  I\u2019m very proud of that, becuase it means we knew herC even though we didn\u2019t know she was a girl, and she agrees it suited and still suits her, and it is a gender neutral nickname, and she is keeping it, with a spelling change to push the feminine side (think Terry to Teri). But she is changing her full name significantly.  Because she has good taste, I really like the new version. It\u2019s only partially what I would have given her, had I known she was a female, but I like it a lot.  \n\nIt\u2019s not at all hard to have this attitude.  Tell your family, \u201cplease act like you love me more than you hate a name change\u201d. If they can\u2019t do that and deal with the name, then you may need to stick with your REAL family that you choose for yourself.  Tell your family of origin, from me, a mom of a trans daughter, \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard.  Just love your kid. Use the words she tells you and and marvel at the great person she has grow  up to be\u201d", "NTA. Your name, your decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, congrats on coming out and living life the way you are!", "Thank you!\nFor clarity my last name is currently King, and is also a small source of dysphoria, despite me having known several women with that last name. \nThey don't like that I'm not going with a fem version of my birth name, as it would \"make it easier for them\" but I have a lot of good friends with that name and would feel weird hanging out with them with their first name \ud83d\ude05", "Yeah, there's a lot there, but it wasn't relevant to the post, so it's been left out", "A lot of them thought I was transitioning because of my now ex-fianc\u00e9 when she used to be one of the bigger causes of my dysphoria. Some of them have apparently been talking behind my back about how they hope that now that they're gone all this \"nonsense\" will stop. I found this out from my mother.\nAnd I made the same point, my name change is no different than someone getting married, it's just changing a title for purpose of pursuing happiness. They're only response was \"it is if you zoom out that much, but it's just different\"", "Both. But as I said, I have no attachment to names beyond what you give to them. My name isn't one that has brought me any good feelings, so I wish to change it to one that makes me feel like me.\n\nMy idea is \"both are changing it and centered on focusing on my personal happiness, so what is the issue?\"", "Lmfao. Hey, they need to do the work to support you. It doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s easier for someone else. That\u2019s why I chose Jonathan. For a long time I was ok people constantly screwing up and using my female name to the point where I told them to you I\u2019ll always be jenni. Like nah. Eventually I woke up and realized I was doing it because I was embarrassed to have to tell my family to have some respect for me. \n\nYou do you. If you love your last name OWN it. \n\nI chose Wolf \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nJaxon Wolf lmfao!!!!!!!! Gotta get trans with the X in Jaxon lmfaooooooo \n\nI chose Jaxon because I liked the name Jax. It fit me. Only two people call me that tho but I love it hahaha. \n\nI chose Wolf because I\u2019ve felt alone most of my life. I always have to do things for myself. My name is very symbolic and very meaningful to me. I would have kept my birth last name but I always wanted a new beginning and sort of rebirth for myself. \n\nI\u2019m not religious but I\u2019m very morally close to catholic teachings. Most churches are very good at accepting everyone for who they are, but there are a select few that don\u2019t promote the acceptance of diversity.\n\nDo whatever makes you feel good in life. Own yourself and all that you are. Don\u2019t be afraid to have private conversations, or to ask someone to make a public announcement for you. I asked my mom to tell my family to please stop misgendering me and calling me by my old name. It was so triggering to hear it. This did wonders, people would still mess up sometimes but I could tell they were trying. To the point where eventually I felt more comfortably quickly correcting them(:", "NTA. I am responding again. I am an old lady. I lost my child many years ago. I would be happy to have a child who loved and respected me. Your choices are NOT phases, whims or any of the like. They are YOUR life choices. Any decent family should want their child to be happy with who they are. You are not who you were and want the old you gone for good, ( if I am not correct, let me know) I bet you picked a lovely name! Enjoy your new life, Dear! I hope your family wakes up! \u2764\ufe0f", "Ooh! Nice!! I'm caught between two names, and Wolfe is gonna be my legal alias, and it's comfortable as it's a neutral gendered middle school nickname (Wolfie) Lara Wolfe, and my true name is one that I though of, but ended up being VERY similar to a videogame character I have come to love (a machine who worked to protect, rather than destroy, so it's creator: a warmind AI, tried to kill him and he just said \"whelp\" and kept going).", "Hahaha nice! Welcome to\nThe wolf gang \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 that\u2019s sick tho! I thought about using my own nickname/Alia\u2019s Jesse Trent. But it was way too like \u2026. I feel my personality would have completely changed knowing that was my legal name \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 bad ass 24/7", "Lmao! Yes! Yeah, currently I'm going by my true names middle name, with the first name being for people I know\nBut if you know the reference, the characters name is one word, but my first name is one part, Winter is the second (But I'm using Winters with my found sister (not blood))"]}
