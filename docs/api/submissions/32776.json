You want to stay home some weekends instead of staying up until 3am waiting for your husband to be done.", "NTA.  How often are these parties?\n\nI suggest you going with your husband to special events (and the occasional random one), but arranging for him to either stay or to get a sober ride home.  Then you visit for a little bit, only drink soda (or sip one drink all evening), and leave ahead of him, saying \"I have to be up for work!\" or \"My head can only take so much fun!\"", "NTA although I don\u2019t think your husband is either.

I had a similar situation until husband saw how many of his cousins had 2+ DUIs and still partied like that thinking it\u2019s okay to do that. They think it\u2019s fine (as they told me) since when they lived in Mexico, it was a small town and it was normal for people to party til late in the morning with loud banda music and drink and drive. He even had an uncle pass away after he flipped his car over on a rural road heading home after a party. I got a lot of flack when I didn\u2019t want to go. Now he sees the situation. I had even offered to drive him there and pick him up. The issue was his cousins would make fun of him about how his wife doesn\u2019t love him because I wouldn\u2019t stay and drink with them like their wives (while there kids were running around in the street). I finally asked them if I should become an alcoholic like them to make them happy (can\u2019t hold down a job, drunk all the time.) I guess pointing it out was such a buzzkill, they were happy I wasn\u2019t there anymore. Slowly my husband didn\u2019t show up to everything because as you age, you realize how drunk people who are in their 40s and 50s look and its not a good look. Like Vegas during the daytime with people drunk outside. Good luck navigating.", "We have had plenty of discussions about it.\nIt always ends with him getting mad at me for not always going and equating it to \u201cI don\u2019t love him enough\u201d. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Why doesn't he \"love you enough\" to see you need a break?", "You\u2019re entitled to enjoy your free time.

Write a letter instead of talking about it. In the letter focus on your experience and feelings while saying nothing but things about his family", "Has he considered the possibility that if \"he loved you enough\" he would gladly skip a few of these parties?", "Does he not realize that love is a 2 way street? Maybe he doesn\u2019t love YOU enough if he\u2019s not willing to compromise. Not to mention binge drinking every weekend is a major \ud83d\udea9for alcoholism."]}
