You want to stay home some weekends instead of staying up until 3am waiting for your husband to be done.", "NTA.  How often are these parties?\n\nI suggest you going with your husband to special events (and the occasional random one), but arranging for him to either stay or to get a sober ride home.  Then you visit for a little bit, only drink soda (or sip one drink all evening), and leave ahead of him, saying \"I have to be up for work!\" or \"My head can only take so much fun!\"", "NTA although I don\u2019t think your husband is either. It sounds like there are cultural differences.", "If your husband is in his 30s and getting really drunk every weekend, he's got a drinking problem.\n\nSorry for you, but you've got some big issues in your marriage.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nIs your husband drinking more than he used to?\n\nAre you the person who drives him home from these parties?\n\nSounds like you are outgrowing behavior and revealing he can't stop.\n\nIf so, he may be using the family partying as a way to hide his alcohol dependence and wants you there with him to normalize something he cannot stop doing.", "NYA bc if u work long hours then u need to chill", "Definitely not NTA. I had a similar situation until husband saw how many of his cousins had 2+ DUIs and still partied like that thinking it\u2019s okay to do that. They think it\u2019s fine (as they told me) since when they lived in Mexico, it was a small town and it was normal for people to party til late in the morning with loud banda music and drink and drive. He even had an uncle pass away after he flipped his car over on a rural road heading home after a party. I got a lot of flack when I didn\u2019t want to go. Now he sees the situation. I had even offered to drive him there and pick him up. The issue was his cousins would make fun of him about how his wife doesn\u2019t love him because I wouldn\u2019t stay and drink with them like their wives (while there kids were running around in the street). I finally asked them if I should become an alcoholic like them to make them happy (can\u2019t hold down a job, drunk all the time.) I guess pointing it out was such a buzzkill, they were happy I wasn\u2019t there anymore. Slowly my husband didn\u2019t show up to everything because as you age, you realize how drunk people who are in their 40s and 50s look and its not a good look. Like Vegas during the daytime with people drunk outside. Good luck navigating.", "We have had plenty of discussions about it.\nIt always ends with him getting mad at me for not always going and equating it to \u201cI don\u2019t love him enough\u201d. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Why doesn't he \"love you enough\" to see you need a break?", "You\u2019re entitled to enjoy your free time. Watching him get loaded isn\u2019t fun for you. He should be glad you\u2019re not asking him to stay home or do something else on the weekends. NTA", "Maybe try a new form of communicating? Write a letter instead of talking about it. In the letter focus on your experience and feelings while saying nothing but things about his family", "Has he considered the possibility that if \"he loved you enough\" he would gladly skip a few of these parties?", "Does he not realize that love is a 2 way street? Maybe he doesn\u2019t love YOU enough if he\u2019s not willing to compromise. Not to mention binge drinking every weekend is a major \ud83d\udea9for alcoholism.", "NTA - I grew up with a father like this. My great aunt was the matriarch & everyone went to her house on the weekends. My mom had no say. Please don\u2019t have kids with him. My dad drove us drunk home on a regular basis & no one saw how wrong that was. If you have kids, it will be expected for all of you to go & for your kids to fall asleep on chairs or a relatives room because he won\u2019t be willing to leave for bedtime. The food was always great at my Tias house but it always came at a high risk.", "It's weird that he sees it as all or nothing. You can go to a party and socialize without drinking. You can have a few drinks and go home at a reasonable hour. You can go once or twice a month instead of every weekend, and you'll still see family way more often than a lot of people do. \n\nIt's sad that he'd rather drink until the wee hours than spend the evening with his spouse. But somehow you don't love him enough? Nonsense.\n\nIt sounds like he may have an unhealthy relationship to alcohol, and it may run in his family. It tends to happen. \n\nI'm also concerned about how he gets home after drinking until 3am. Or is that why he wants you there, as designated driver?\n\nNTA", "Not the AH. As we get older, we change. It\u2019s normal. Tell him the shaming needs to stop. You don\u2019t have to attend every event nor do you have to drink.", "NTA.\n\nYour in-laws sound like a mass of people with alcoholism. So sad.", "NTA. Set up a schedule. He gets 1 weekend a month for his fun, you get 1 for yours. 2 weekends for utility/recovery ( don\u2019t use your weekends for this).", "NTA - don\u2019t have babies unless hubby grows up.", "NTA, OP!  He needs to respect you as much as you respect him!  It\u2019s ok to have different interests and styles.  It\u2019s not like you never join the parties.  And tell him to knock off the emotionally manipulative whining", "He\u2019s 34 and still getting drunk regularly?  You two are maturing at very different levels.  Maybe try couples counseling and get on the same page or it might be the end.  NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake a new rule: You come along ONCE a month, holidays included.", "NTA. Drink more water tho. You don\u2019t have to ever have a hangover.", "NTA for not wanting to go out all the time, you shouldn't, and don't, have to do anything like that just because someone else wants you to. But at the very end, it also sounds like you are trying to shame him because he wants to go out, which also isn't cool.", "NTA. I want to ask thigh, don\u2019t you find it annoying (I\u2019m not Mexican but have been to hundreds of parties and events for Mexican friends and work) that the sound system is always at the highest volume possible?!", "NTA.  Drive him over to their events, stay for an hour or so, say hello to everyone so they know you showed up, eat, then take yourself home.  Set an alarm for 1:30 in the morning, go back and pick him up.  If he asks, tell him you had a headache and were laying down.   Unless you have kids, most will never notice you left.   (Naturally I'm assuming you live close to the place the events are being held; if you don't, grab a book and hide in a back room - I used to hide out in the hot tub room and recently discovered one brother took his book and hid in dad's shop in the basement.)", "NTA at all, but you both have to decide how you want to move forward here. Your tastes and preferences have changed. You want to be a homebody, and your husband wants to stay out drinking until 3 am every weekend. That is not a great equilibrium if you also want to spend a lot of time together. You're going to have to figure out how often you need to be together, and he needs to back off the shaming just bc you want different things than you used to.", "I'm the unlucky neighbor trying to sleep with earplugs at 2 am while his family parties at msx volume. \n\nEvery weekend. And sometimes weeknights. \n\nNTA", "Turn it around on him.  Tell him he doesn\u2019t love you enough and a man should put his wife first, not be a momma\u2019s boy.", "Why does he need to manipulate you? Ask him. Maybe he doesn't love you enough. Flip it on him he's acting like a child.", "That's emotional manipulation. You guys need marriage counseling. He's TA for expecting you to do what he wants and only what he wants every weekend."]}
