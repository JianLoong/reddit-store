For this trip, we will be driving for a day straight, staying at a hotel, then finishing the second half of the drive after our hotel stay. My parents also need to buy a rooftop cargo carrier to hold all of our stuff and we'll be eating fast food along the way.  In an attempt to save money for this trip, my dad decided to take up a second job and my stay-at-home mom got a job to save money for Christmas.\u00a0\n\nWell, today my brother and I sent our Christmas lists to our parents so they can both look over them to start shopping this weekend. As my dad was going over my brother\u2019s list, my brother kept saying he really really wants a drawing tablet and has given our parents a specific list of things his tablet has to have. This includes: being standalone (he doesn\u2019t want to connect it to his computer), run the best and most recent operating system, come with a drawing pen, and have lots of storage.\n\nThis is obviously in no way something my family can get my brother, along with his other gifts, my gifts, family gifts, and a 2-day drive + a hotel stay. Despite this, my dad has been doing a bunch of research on tablets he can get my brother.\u00a0\n\nEvery time my dad suggests a specific tablet to my brother, he gets extremely upset (yelling at him, stomping his feet, and talking down to him) when the tablet doesn\u2019t have everything he wants. \n\nThe last time my brother yelled at my dad, I texted him and said\u00a0\n\n\u201cyou need to stop yelling at dad when he suggests different tablets and they aren\u2019t exactly what you want. you\u2019re gonna have to settle at some point if you want a tablet and you\u2019re being a selfish little boy. our trip to see the family is more important than you're gift. apologize to him\u201d\n\nmy brother went to apologize to my dad and he now seems to be sulking and not talking to me.

You did the right thing, as this will be putting massive stress on your parents who are obviously trying to do everything they can. 100% not the asshole; if he\u2019s sulking with you it\u2019s because he\u2019s feeling guilty.", "NTA. You're right. He's too old to be throwing selfish tantrums like this, and he's old enough to understand how money works. He needs to find a compromise (maybe cut out all the other gifts).", "NTA. You called him out for being selfish and it is a good lesson before it gets out of hand. You are great for considering what your family is doing and the expenses! I don't know where you are, but I do long distance trips a few times a year (2 12-13 hours drives and then back this year and several 4-8 hours trips) and you can find a lot of healthy snack at the gas stations that also cater to truck drivers. My favorite healthy snacks are fruit, veggies, and hard boiled eggs to really keep me settled between meals. I'm in the Western part of the US.", "OP, I think you did a great job here!! Obvi your lil bro listens and looks up to you because he did apologize. I\u2019d talk to him maybe and dig deeper for his sake. Maybe explain a little more how hard your parents are sacrificing and how much things cost. Teenagers can be notoriously dense about finances and what it takes to run a home. He needed to hear what you texted him, but it might be super helpful to go to talk to him. Hug him(only if he\u2019s receptive of course!). Good luck and you sound like an amazing and self-aware person as well as a fantastic sister. \u2665\ufe0f So far NTA it\u2019s refreshing!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
