This year, my sister asked if we can not exchange gifts because she is saving up to take her kids on an extravagant vacation this spring (Europe), and wants to put the money that she\u2019d use on gifts towards the trip.

I respond and say thanks, but I am not getting them anything as you said you wanted to skip gifts this year.\n\nShe tells me she thought I\u2019d still be getting the girls gifts.

She corrects herself and says she would not be buying me or my kids gifts as she\u2019s trying to save money for her trip as we had previously discussed, but she still thinks I should buy her daughters gifts. I was appalled. It\u2019s not like she can\u2019t afford to buy my kids gifts. If that were the case, I\u2019d absolutely still buy her kids gifts. She is choosing not to buy them gifts to spend the extra money on her own kids. No problem, but why should I still spend extra money on her kids then so they can get a nice vacation and extra gifts? I thought about getting them a small gift card or something anyways, but decided against it as I didn\u2019t want my sister to feel bad for not getting my kids anything. Im not wealthy. I could afford to get them something anyways, but I also have plenty of bills I could use the money for. I told my sister if she wants me to get her kids gifts, I expect her to get my kids something, even something small, in return. She said no and called me an AH because \u201cit\u2019s not her daughters\u2019 fault they are going to Europe so she doesn\u2019t have the extra money to spend on my kids this year\u201d.

It's her fault. 5 and 7 may be past the \"prefers the box\" stage, but they don't need anything fancy. Just a little something from their aunt to show she cares.

And knowing how mean your sister is being . . . do you really want to be the aunt who punishes YOUR nieces and behaves like your sister is?

Frankly, given that your nieces are teenagers, I'd use this as an opportunity... \"I know that your mom isn't any getting gifts for \\[your kids names\\] because she wants to spend it on your trip, but I hate the idea of my nieces feeling like I don't think about them at the holidays, so I thought I'd get you two a little something anyway.
