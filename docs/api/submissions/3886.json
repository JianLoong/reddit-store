This year, my sister asked if we can not exchange gifts because she is saving up to take her kids on an extravagant vacation this spring (Europe), and wants to put the money that she\u2019d use on gifts towards the trip. I say sure, no problem.\n\nFast forward to last week. She sends me a list of some of the things her daughters would like for Christmas. I respond and say thanks, but I am not getting them anything as you said you wanted to skip gifts this year.\n\nShe tells me she thought I\u2019d still be getting the girls gifts. So I say okay no problem, here is what my kids would like. She corrects herself and says she would not be buying me or my kids gifts as she\u2019s trying to save money for her trip as we had previously discussed, but she still thinks I should buy her daughters gifts. I was appalled. It\u2019s not like she can\u2019t afford to buy my kids gifts. If that were the case, I\u2019d absolutely still buy her kids gifts. She is choosing not to buy them gifts to spend the extra money on her own kids. No problem, but why should I still spend extra money on her kids then so they can get a nice vacation and extra gifts? I thought about getting them a small gift card or something anyways, but decided against it as I didn\u2019t want my sister to feel bad for not getting my kids anything. Im not wealthy. I could afford to get them something anyways, but I also have plenty of bills I could use the money for. I told my sister if she wants me to get her kids gifts, I expect her to get my kids something, even something small, in return. She said no and called me an AH because \u201cit\u2019s not her daughters\u2019 fault they are going to Europe so she doesn\u2019t have the extra money to spend on my kids this year\u201d. I caved and got them gift cards (because it\u2019s not their fault my sister is being a jerk), and told my sister, but then she was mad that I spent less than usual on them. AITA?\n\nETA: thank you everyone! You\u2019ve made me feel better about whether or not I was being petty to my nieces. I\u2019ve decided to give the gift cards to my kids teachers. I will buy my kids an extra something too. My nieces are still getting gifts because I love them, but it will be a BOSE wireless speaker and a package of glitter bath bombs to share between the two. They will genuinely like those, and it will drive my sister nuts :)", "created_utc": 1670116980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbwmm9/aita_for_not_buying_my_nieces_christmas_gifts/", "score": 2394, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My first aquarium as an adult housed 5 small goldfish, a common pleco and 4 mystery snails. I fell in love with all of their personalities. The goldfish greeted me every time I walked past the tank, and each of them had different ways of \"playing\" with me and loved to dance between my fingers. Even the snails let me know when they were hungry, loved on me and played with me in their own ways, and were little bubble parasail masters. \u2661 \n\nWhen the goldfish outgrew the tank, I was wrecked with grief. Balancing a tank's pH & ammonia with that many growing goldies was becoming too stressful- for me and for them. I surrendered them to my local pet store that has a floor dedicated to goldfish and gives them to enthusiasts that can properly care for them. \n\nNow? I have a parrot cichlid that is under a year old that I've had since she was a fry. She dances, plays with ping pong balls and shows anger and frustration when she doesn't get her way. She has an incredible personality and I'm completely obsessed with her. She tolerates me \ud83e\udd70\n\nAnyway, that's my soapbox speech, I suppose. Fish (and amphibians!) are spectacular tiny people with complex emotions and extremely specific needs.

As a kid, I was of course thrilled I didn\u2019t need to practice for hours on end.

If anything it\u2019s your young kids who need gifts. Hers are old enough to understand they are getting Europe instead. You are being too generous. Who\u2019s going to explain to your kids why their cousins have gifts but they do not.

Christmas gifts should be given freely.  Do you love your nieces and want to give them a gift?  If so, give them a gift.  I think you should be the bigger person here.  Your sister is being an AH.

And you shouldn't have caved into buying them gift cards. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. It's one thing to say, let's just do no gifts, or let's just get the kids gifts but not adults.

Wtf kind of logic is that?", "NTA, I know people have already given you some pretty good suggestions, but honestly I would say you should pick out the cheapest annoying things to send.

Has your sis told her daughters this idea that your daughters won\u2019t get gifts? Reason I ask is maybe they would want to get their little cousins gifts with their pocket money. \n\nAlso do you have to #buy the gifts?

The best gifts we got we homemade, and mostly food \ud83d\ude01 \n\nI have a suggestion for a gift for all 4 kids if that\u2019s ok, so neither your daughters nor your nieces are left out.

If your sister once gets away with this behaviour it will get into a repeating pattern. Next year / birthdays she will have another excuse why your children get nothing and her children should get something.

So why she thinks you should get her kids presents while she gets your kids nothing just doesn't make sense.", "I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t buy her children Christmas gifts.

Her kids are not \"in need\" of gifts.  There is a great reason to just end this tradition now.  Use the gift cards on your own kids and call it a day.  \n\nThis is just some messed up hill your sister is willing ro die on because I promise you an extra $20-50 bucks is NOT making or breaking her trip to Europe.  It's really more about your sister using people.   \n\nAlso, two teenagers can much better understand not getting gifts because of a trip than little kids.  It's a ridiculous stance.

Plus rubbing it in your face how they are going to Europe. \u201cOoh poor me I have no money left to spend on my sisters kids \u201c get outta here. Send the kids baked goods. It\u2019s a gift. So your sister can\u2019t complain.", "I'm going to be an outlier here, but I think ESH...\n\nHer sister mostly and clearly. You don't demand gifts. She told him there would be no exchange, which is fair - you have a big expense coming up and you are being upfront about an exceptional situation. That heads up is enough. Being pissy about not getting gifts then is wild. Being cross that the gifts are not expensive enough is looney.\n\nI would expect the brother to still send a gift if this exchange had not occurred at all. Just like you don't demand gifts, you don't give gifts just because you are getting some in return. He had enough context to know why he should keep his end by sending a small token gift to his nieces (who didn't do anything wrong). That he was not going to do it on his own makes him a little AH as well. And I don't buy the \"I didn't want to embarrass my sister by giving a gift anyway\". Bro, your sister doesn't seem the kind to get embarrassed by a gift and you have known her your whole life.\n\nAll that said, given everything - I wouldn't send a penny at this point.
