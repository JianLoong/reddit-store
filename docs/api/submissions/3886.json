I mean\u2026if teenagers can\u2019t possibly understand why they are being \u201cpunished\u201d for going to Europe, then how does she expect your little ones to?\n\nI have an older sister a lot like yours and it\u2019s so fun watching her face turn 50 shades of red when I throw her logic back at her.", "I know that her kids did nothing wrong, but also, your kids did nothing wrong either and they aren\u2019t getting gifts. So why do your nieces get gifts?   \nat the beginning of your post it literally says that sis asked that you guys not exchange gifts this year, so why did she think you would still get her kids gifts? You are doing what she asked.", "You could take it a step-further, depending on how close you are to your nieces. \n\nDefinitely give them a gift, but also ask them if they would like to chose a gift for your kids from them (obviously you pay). That way your kids don't get left out either.", "Keep the cards. Get one speaker between them, let your sister referee who uses it. She'll enjoy that \ud83d\ude01  nta", "Get them Bluetooth mics with a voice changer. Pretty cheap but SUPER annoying. Trust me I know from experience", "Let me give you a list of annoying gifts to give your nieces that don't tend to cost a lot of money:\n\nOption 1: Bath bombs\n\nThey get all over the bath and the bath may need cleaning. Make sure to pick something colourful that will get colours all over the bath. Also pick ones with plants in them which will get all over the bath tub.\n\nOption 2: Coloured hair spray\n\nThere is a good chance they will spray this stuff all over the bathroom when they use it and is a nuisance to clean the bathroom when it gets all over the sink, the floors and especially the walls.\n\nOption 3: Fish, lizards, etc.\n\nThese things require ongoing care which costs money.\n\nOption 4: Cheap but noisy instruments\n\nUkuleles (best option) and also flutes, those shaky things, etc. \n\nOption 5: Paint\n\nIf your nieces like art, buy them some paint. There is a chance they will make a mess at some point.", "Two kazoos and recorders", "\u201cWhat? You said I needed to spend more sister. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d *evil grinch grin*", "That\u2019s a good idea. Giving them the money right at Christmas, it\u2019s more than likely it would be spent before their trip.", "YES", "Never give a living thing unless the person caring for it wants it. A lizard or fish does not deserve to suffer because you want revenge. I know those particular animals seem aloof, but they are still living beings, and can live a long time if treated properly (my brother had an iguana that he got at 13 and moved with him several times before he died of old age when brother was almost 30!).\n\nOtherwise, all good ideas!", "How could you list all these items and not include *glitter*, the most terrible of them all? I disagree over gifting pets though, shouldn't force any animal to have to endure OP's sister.", "Don\u2019t worry, no pets will be gifted! Not fair to the animal. I do live the bath bombs, glitter and music ideas.", "A few years ago my sister in law combined 1 and 5, did you know it's possible to buy a \"make your own bath bombs\" craft set?! We get along but she has an interesting decision-making protocol.", "Ok, yes to most of these, but please don't get them pets. If the Mom is nice and doesn't want them, they'll get rehomed, and it'll super stressful for the animal(s) and lead to future behavioural or health issues that could lead to constant rehoming or being put down for being unadoptable.
