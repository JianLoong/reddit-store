It was very hard on him and his father.  The holidays were rough.  My husband is still struggling and I've been doing my best to be kind, supportive, and understanding.  But he's been less attentive with our 3 kids (14F, 12M, & 9M) and I'm pretty sure he's struggling at work too but he won't admit it.  He started therapy about a month ago and is going once a week.  \n\nA couple weeks ago he brought up to me that he wants to move his dad (75M) into our house.  He said that his dad is struggling too and that being in the house he shared with his wife the past 50-years isn't doing him any good.  He had an entire plan laid out so it was obvious to me that he's been planning this for a while without talking to me about it.  \n\nHe wants to move his dad into the room that we had just moved our middle child into last summer.  Before that, our 2 youngest were sharing a room so we did some renovations to make an extra bedroom so all our kids could have their own space.  He wants to force our 2 youngest to share a room again so his dad can move in.  He also wants to talk to his dad about putting their house on the market or possibly renting it out, which means FIL would be here long-term.  \n\nAfter he laid out his plan, he asked me what I thought and I told him my immediate reaction is \"no.\"  I told him that barely any time has passed since his mom's death and it's too soon to make such drastic changes in everyone's lives.  I told him his dad will get better with time and we all just need to take a step back and not rush into any decisions.  \n\nHe was not happy with my response and kept asking for specific reasons other than \"not enough time has passed.\"  I suggested that we look into different housing options for his dad if he's uncomfortable in his home, which I get.  His dad has enough money saved to afford a good retirement home or smaller condo, which would allow everyone to still have their own space.  He didn't like that idea either because it would mean his dad is still living alone.  \n\nI'll admit, there are reasons I didn't tell him.  Seeing my husband deal with his grief has been hard, especially since it's effecting his ability to be present with me and the kids.  I really don't want a second grieving man in our house.  I also really don't want to kick our middle child out of the room that we just made specifically for them.  That isn't fair to them.  But I know if I tell my husband this, he's going to think I'm being selfish, and maybe I am.  \n\nFIL currently lives about 3 hours away so visiting him is difficult.  We also live in a pretty rural area and the nearest town with respectable retirement homes is over an hour away, so even that option isn't ideally close, but it's still closer.  I know it sounds selfish, but I just don't think I could handle 2 grieving men in my home. I can barely handle one right now.", "created_utc": 1678392907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n2gfm/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_husband_move_his/", "score": 891, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I remember her saying that often the parent was offered their place to stay out of grief and guilt and the gesture was poorly thought through. It caused huge amounts of upheaval to the family, caused all sorts of stress, anger and resentment. \nIf everyone is on board then that's different but, here, they're not. This is a big change for everyone and you both need to be in agreement. As others have said, there is more than one option - getting his own home nearer you for one. I love my mum to pieces and we get on so well but I would not want to have her live with me but, if she moved close by, that would be great - I'm close by so could see her regularly and help when needed. I would be happy to help her with housework, shopping etc but, both of us in the same house? No, not happening!\nThe loss for your husband is still quite recent and I hope he finds his way again and you can reach a compromise you can all live with.", "Nta. You have equal decision power. Perhaps share our concern with husband not being available to you and kids? Let him know you ask for time becauae he is still grieving", "NTA, I don't think it's ever a good idea to move a grandfather into the house. They deserve respect but they're old people and they struggle with adapting to new shared spaces. My grandpa went to live with her favourite daughter (my aunt) and their 3 kids (all adults) and it ended up in total shipwreck. He died with my aunt refusing to see him. Bringing him closer is a good idea but I would wait some more and investigate other close by options.", "YTA \n\nImagine if it were your parents and he reacted the way you would. You love your husband but don't want to deal with him in his grief. Terrible.", "Yta for just saying no and not really wanting to make any compromise with your husband. You admitted your ideas weren't great. It's just about you and what you want. You don't seem to be taking your husband's feeling or concerns into consideration at all. Just no.", "NTA, your FIL and husband are suffering.  However, making a huge move, basically ripping FIL away from his friends and familiar environment, and basically isolating him in a rural area is not healthy.", "When my step-dad passed away, my mom tried to live in their home by herself during covid.  She was grieving, and she was lonely.  She now lives in a retirement home, and she is much happier.  She still has all her friends and has made new ones, is still independent, they go places, and she has help if she needs it. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your home too and the home of your children - that\u2019s important too. \n\nI think a further conversation with your husband about his distance from your children since his Mum passed is in order as that may help him see your side but that will be a tough conversation. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t been much time at all but I don\u2019t think it will be a short while before this gets any better. I hope everything works out.", "NTA in that moving a person into a household should be a household decision, especially when it concerns a drastic living situation change for 2 of your children and appears to be permanent.\n\nI think as other commenters have said, a reasonable compromise would be for FIL to buy a small place close by.\n\nI did have massive AH vibes when you were worrying about how your grieving husband wasn't being attentive enough and how you couldn't cope with 2 grieving men. As someone who recently lost a parent, it's devastating and your husband will need time, love and support to move through his grief and it appears from the way you have written this that you aren't willing or able to give as much of this as he might need.", "NTA, it has to be two yes or he doesn\u2019t move in. I wouldn\u2019t want to live in my parents or even my in laws either. I love them but in their own homes. Time really hasn\u2019t passed yet, he has to ride the wave. Maybe look into housing closer to you guys, but his main priority should be you and his kids. Sorry he\u2019s not grieving healthy.", "Has your husband even discussed this with his father? for one everyone says wait a year to make big decisions about life after an event like that. For another who says this man wants to leave his home of 50 years? It seems like your husband is projecting his own grief and trying to \"fix\" the problem when it just needs to be processed. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Forget about the grieving, your first responsibility is to your kids.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, you need to put your three kids needs first.  I'm sure taking care of the kids is quite demanding all by itself.  The very last thing you need is another person who needs to be taken care of.  \n\nAnd if your AH husband wants his dad to sell his house, clearly he's intending you to \"take care of him\" instead of moving him into a retirement home.  While you have three kids to take care of.\n\nYour husband is absolutely an AH **for planning this out at length without even talking to you about it.**  \n\nI'd say make this your hill to die on.  You have your hands full.", "NAH\n\nI get where you\u2019re both coming from! \n\nYoure totally valid in your reasoning, whether it\u2019s selfish or not. You shouldn\u2019t have to uproot your kids in order to house his dad. \n\nBut that\u2019s also his dad and he\u2019s far away and really struggling rn. I would drop anything to help my dad, and I think it\u2019s actually a sign of good character that your husband wants to take care of his dad\n\nAlso, i think y\u2019all are struggling with communication more than anything. He\u2019s your husband, you should be able to be honest about your concerns. Staying quiet truly serves no one", "NAH - I understand your concerns, and I also understand why you\u2019d be hesitant with making your youngest live together again. I\u2019m sure this would all be a hard adjustment on your kids, so thank you for considering their feelings and keeping them at the forefront. As parents, that\u2019s ultimately your main responsibility!\n\nHowever, I understand your husband\u2019s point of view as well. His father is alone, grieving, and he wants to help him. It\u2019s great that your husband is willing to take in his elderly grieving father. Them being together might help your husband in his grieving process as well, so this is important for both of them. The grieving process is hard and long, and it hasn\u2019t been very long at all for either of them.\n\nI think both of your emotions are running high. Be kind and compassionate to him while still making your points about this being a big adjustment for the kids. I *do* think it\u2019s important for his dad to move closer to all of you, whether that\u2019s in the same house or a place nearby. This is something you both need to work out, with his father\u2019s and your children\u2019s input as well; they might want grandpa around! They might not mind sharing again if it means he gets to live with them, kids can be very empathetic. \n\nRemember, it\u2019s the both of you working against this hurdle and supporting each other, *not* you vs. him. You both need each other.", "NAH. Regardless of the decision, it is never smart to make a big decision right after an event like that. \n\nHe should not have done all this planning before talking to you, but a hard no is also a little harsh for someone grieving. Saying you need time to process such a big and permanent decision could be better.\n\nIt would not be fair to the kids, but that doesn't mean there can't be more compromise. \n\nIs there a small house or apartment near you that is renting? This way, you can be closer without making the kids share a room.", "NTA - it's rightly said that one should not make major life decisions for a year following a loss such as this.  Your FIL is not in any sort of a hardship situation, such as needing care, etc.  You have offered a perfectly rational alternative such a s a different home/condo.  It could even be close by where husband and FIl could spend time together and FIL could have more contact with grandkids, which might be of help to him and good for the kids.  You might point out to your husband that taking away your child's room at this point for a non-urgent need is NOT going to endear Gramps to that child.\n\nYour husband is grieving and it's good that he's getting help but I really think this is a hill to die on.  Nothing radical to be done for one year and even then, if you don't feel it's a good idea, then it shouldn't happen.  For all you know, this is the prelude to you having to take over as a full time caregiver as FIL ages.  If you are not up for that, stand your ground.", "When it was time to move my grandmother in, my parents added on to the house and my aunts helped pay. Is something like this an option?", "NTA\n\nYour responsibility is to your kids. You might want to remind your husband of that too. It would be a completely different situation if the father couldn't afford to live alone but that didn't seem to be the case", "NTA\n\nHow are you being selfish by prioritizing your child over a grown man?? It's awful your MIL has passed away. I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nMaking both your children share a room after you _just_ renovated so they didn't have to do that would create resentment in your home.\n\nYour husband is allowed to grieve but when you have children you can't just peace out.  \n\nI think your solution to having him move closer makes lots of sense. Everyone stays independent but then your husband can visit your FIL much easier.", "NTA. \n\nThe first thing that strikes me is that it wouldn't be fair to your children, who just go their own rooms. Sure, lots of kids share and even have tinier spaces to deal with, but in this case, you just presented them with their own rooms AND they went through a process to get there, so taking them away creates sadness, confusion, and probably some animosity. That animosity is a particularly bad thing when you have TWO grieving people in the home who will be the focus of that animosity. \n\nSecond, your husband is barely meeting his duties now- not judging- and wants to add another person to the mix, and all signs point to his father also being your responsibility. Even if the guy is nice and plucky for 75, who is going to move the stuff, who is going to help him get situated, who is going to grocery shop for him, feed him, do all the stuff of getting him to your house, settled, and getting rid of his stuff/other house? It's gonna be you. This man is added work at a time when you have too much already. \n\nAnd finally, yes, the multiple grieving men is a valid reason. \n\nYou need to be more honest with your husband- I know you are struggling with losing your mom, but that struggle has been passed on to me in various ways. You are checked out, I am alone doing X, Y, Z. Now you come to me with a very big thing and I don't think I can handle it. I can't handle caring for another person, and given how you have been, it will be on me. I think it will impact the children negatively as they just got their own rooms, and I can't handle more negativity in this home.", "Why not compromise he stays with you for 6 months while he finds a closer place , your husband will not having to carry the guilt of his dad being alone and hael quicker", "I\u2019m gonna go NAH\n\nHe\u2019s thinking about the well-being of his father and you are thinking about the well-being of you and your children. It\u2019s a tough decision to make but you\u2019re going to have to make one soon. I suggest being completely honest. Not in a mean way but if this will really impact the wellbeing of your children, that needs to be taken into consideration. Can another room be turned into a space for him so that everyone can be happy? Try to come up with compromises.", "YTA. At 75, surrounded by his grandchildren he has a chance of moving out of his grief and into a new family relationship with his son and grandchildren. He is more likely to be better, not worse. Your husband will also be better because he won\u2019t be worried about his dad and having to drive hours and hours to go check up on him. You\u2019ll get to spend more time with your children which is what you\u2019re complaining about he isn\u2019t doing.\n\nThis could be a temporary situation. Give your husband and his father some time to heal, and then make a decision about whether you all want to get a larger living situation maybe with a Inlaw apartment or if he\u2019s ready to move back home.", "NAH. It's a big change for everyone.", "Not wanting to live with your in laws is reason enough. He should just get his own place nearby. NTA.", "NTA...Adding your FIL to your household would be a major disruption to your household. Your husband assumed you'd say yes, but you don't have to.", "NTA but you need to give your husband all of your reasons. He kept his pans from you but that doesn't mean you keep this from him. Be open and be calm.", "I cannot believe anyone is saying Y T A to not wanting your FIL to move in permanently. We don't even know he would want that. Living with someone, never mind pushing your kids back into sharing a room indefinitely, is a *big deal*.\n\nHard NTA. I think you all having a discussion about him selling up and buying a smaller place nearby is a way better option.", "YTA. I can see your points. But it sounds selfish to me.", "[deleted]", "ESH.  Your husband should have spoken to you first; not last.  I am not sure how I feel about your not wanting to move his father in, but don't be surprised when he or your children put you in a home.", "YTA.\n\n1. It's responsible of your husband to create a plan and a pitch to you rather than just asking with no plan. It enables a good discussion.\n2. When he asked you for feedback, you just said \"no\". It's okay to have boundaries and to share boundaries, but ultimatums and zero negotiation stances are not team player moves.\n3. \"not enough time has passed\" is a terrible thing to say on your end. Your FIL spent his whole life with his late wife, and now you get to assign a grief period? WTF is that? His grief will take its time, and he needs support.\n4. You not wanting to see two people grieving is a pretty selfish reason to say no with no room to negotiate. They're grieving, and that's annoying to you- not exactly supportive behavior.\n\nThere are middle ground options. Buy FIL a trailer to live in at your house while finding independent arrangements for him. Move to a new home that can accommodate everyone. Other options, other ideas. You just say no out of hand and don't try to help in any way, and have only selfish reasons listed here.", "Grief is tough. You only have one mother. It\u2019s not a loss that you just get over in a few months. You frame this process like it\u2019s a struggle for you to be empathetic. Similarly, his father lost his life partner of 50 years. I cannot imagine having so little empathy for my husbands only remaining parent that stuffing him in a retirement home hours away is a reasonable solution. It\u2019s beyond selfish\u2014 it\u2019s cruel. Life is about change. Just like a relationship changes with the introduction of children, it changes as we navigate grief and loss with our partners. \n\nThere is NAH when one partner wants an aging parent to move into the home and the other partner wants to explore other options. You are married though. His family and obligations are your family and obligations. He is the grandfather to your children. Being near them will help him and by extension your husband. It doesn\u2019t have to take away from your life, it can add even more joy. \n\nWhat makes YTA here is everything is about you not wanting to \u201cdeal with\u201d your husband and his fathers \u201cemotions\u201d like losing a foundational person in their life should just be gotten over without anyone in your family having to help carry any of the grief. Perhaps you should explore why you have such a negative view of your husband (and his father) showing emotions.", "NTA. Don't let these comments guilt you for valid feelings. It's hard to live with a grieving person. I lost my dad in 2022 and I have been insufferable for my family to be around, I know this. So I can see how your husband's grief is affecting your family. I agree that moving FIL in your home may make this issue persist. I read another comment that mentioned getting him an apartment near your family, that sounds like a reasonable compromise.", "**ESH\n\nI work in a nursing home\n\n\nWe have a resident who\u2019s been there for 5 years, he and his wife came together. She passed 6 months after arriving, leaving him there alone. Everyday he wanders the hall in his wheelchair asking every single person if they have seen his wife because he can\u2019t find her. He was lucid and perfectly cognizant when she died. The grief literally broke his brain.  I can\u2019t imagine making such a selfish choice. Do you think he wants to deal with the grief? Or wants to rely on his sons family? Probably fucking not, but sometimes we just have to deal with shit.\n\n\nESH because nowhere do I see what the man in question wants mentioned anywhere in this post.", "NTA.

Not yet anyway. It sounds like your husband is wanting to make decision without consulting you *or* his father.  Grief counseling  and some meeting of the minds need to take place first.

I like that you phrased it that \u201cmy initial reaction is no\u201d because that lacks the finality and keeps the discussion going. I don\u2019t think you need to necessarily give ground here, but you could talk about moving his father closer. If there isn\u2019t a good retirement community nearby, surely there is at least an apartment complex that you could move him into temporarily. Then you could be open to the father selling the home and building a mother-in-law unit onto your own home with that money. Your husband is likely not just grieving his mom, but also grieving the situation that his father is now in and feeling like his father should be closer, and regretting that his father is so far away and going through this alone. So moving the father closer might also help your husband through his grief. And having the grandkids close by might work wonders for your FIL grief too. I think you can work out a compromise here that helps everyone without compromising your own wishes for your own children.", "NTA.  I was in a similar situation.  My now-ex wanted to move his dad in with us.  I was 6 months pregnant and we were getting ready to move.  I said no. One day, ex went to \"visit\" his dad and just brought him home and moved him in.  I ended up having to provide care for him after a surgery, he only showered when told to, he smoked, and he stank.  I should have been preparing for our baby and instead I was caring for someone I didn't even like, much less want living with us.\n\nYour family, meaning you/husband/kids, comes first.

But look what happened when he did talk to you! \n\nImagine that one of your parents died. You're worried about the remaining parent and struggling to deal with your own grief. Meanwhile your husband is complaining about you not pulling your weight around the house or working hard enough. How would you feel?\n\nYou need to step back and examine how you can support your husband right now.

I get how you are feeling but it really is heartless. If your FIL sells his house can you put an addition on your home to give him his own room.

Tell him you understand he is grieving, but this is impacting you and your family also. Without an open talk, you won\u2019t find a solution.", "NAH. This is a hard situation. And a huge life change for everyone. You both have some valid points. I hope you two can figure out how to sit down and talk with each other openly. Be honest with each other.

I'm sorry, I'm sure this is a hard situation.", "Your perspective and hesitation are valid, but just as your SO would be the AH if he 'insisted' on his father moving in, YTA for 'refusing'. You don't come across in this post as being very patient or empathetic. It sounds like the loss is quite fresh, within the last 6 months, and your husband is rightly concerned for how his father, aging and now living alone 3 hours away, is faring. That might even be contributing to his level distraction you observed with the kids. \n\nHowever moving your FIL in long-term or permanently is not the answer, necessarily. You should have another conversation in which you explore the options with your husband. Maybe FIL living in a supportive facility that offers him socialization, being 1 hour away instead of 3, would be a better option. Maybe having him live with you for a short period, say 3-6 months, especially in conjunction with planning his longer-term living arrangements whether that is selling his home for a condo or something else, would work well. Maybe there are other family members with whom it would make more sense for him to spend time. Also have a frank discussion about what you can expect for responsibilities, schedule impacts, etc. from having FIL live with you for even a short period of time, with the expectation that it is shared and temporary.\n\nBut I think you need to double down on the patience and empathy for your SO and FIL. While you are rightly worried for your own mental health, burden, and the impact on your kids, as a spouse and partner to your husband, you need to be more compassionate of his grief and the time it will take for him to get back to normal.", "NTA. Your reasons are valid and you should bring them up with your husband. Discuss how it makes you uncomfortable and you really have no rooms to spare. I doubt your two sons would be thrilled to move back to sharing a room. Children need their private space to call their own as they get older. I grew up sharing a room with my older sister. When we moved I had the possibility of having my own separate room, but, wishy washily, I chose to keep the status quo and the remaining room became my mum's sewing room and guest room. In hindsight, I wish I had taken up the offer.\n\nYour post made me think once again that neighbourhoods should be zoned for double housing on one lot and that the options of building a granny/in-law suite should be offered.

Your husband isn't thinking straight because of his grief. It would be different if you had a spare bedroom. \n\nYou're probably also doing the majority of the family labor right now, and one more person, being a senior and all, is going to just be that much more weight on your shoulders and you can't carry everyone around you like that. It's healthy to recognize your limits, and I hope that your husband can understand.", "NTA, not even close. The fact that DH came to you with a fully formed plan rather than talking you through it from the very beginning is a problem. \n\nAlso, what\u2019s his plan for the extra labor and expenses his father creates? Who\u2019s doing FILs laundry and cooking? What\u2019s the plan for WHEN he needs additional care? Who is helping him with doctor appointments, personal care, errands, shopping? If DH pushes that onto you for the kids he will \ud83d\udcaf do it for elder care. This is a hill you die on - voice of experience here, it can crush you, crush your family, and it could last for years or even decades, swallowing your family and marriage whole. \n\nUpending your family life as a knee jerk for DH to try to fix his grief and guilt is not ok. Individual therapy for him, couples therapy for you both, and if he pushes this - rethink things. If he\u2019s expecting you to pick up this load, your health is on the line.", "NAH.\n\nYou are all grieving here, some more than others.\n\nYour husband is worried about his father being alone, which is understandable.  But has your husband actually talked with his father about moving into your home?  Is it something his father actually wants?  Being in the house he shared with his wife for 50+ years is probably a mixed bag for your FIL.  Those memories can be overwhelming as well as comforting.  Also, making a big change so soon after your MIL's passing might not be a good idea.  It may be too much too soon for FIL.\n\nI agree that it might be upsetting to your kids to have their lives upended right now as well.  Are they close to their grandparents?  Are they missing their grandmother?  And yes, asking a 12 year old to move back in with his younger sibling permanently will probably cause resentment.  Your kids are as much of a priority as your FIL, and maybe even more so.  If FIL being there were to be a temporary thing, moving your two sons into the same room wouldn't be the worst thing, but a permanent change might be too much.\n\nI'm glad your husband is starting counseling.  Losing a parent is hard, and it brings on a lot of different emotions, and it can make thinking clearly difficult.  But please give him a break. He is going to be more withdrawn and not so present with you and the kids.  Counseling should help with that.  For now, you're going to need to shoulder more responsibility while your husband works through his grief, and you need to be able to talk about this with your kids.\n\nYour concerns about your FIL's moving into the house are valid.  You don't address it in your post, but is he able to live independently? Does he have health concerns that need to be addressed? Has he been so depressed that he can't function?  Would you have to assume care-taking responsibilities?  Do you generally get along and have a good relationship?  You're going to be the one taking responsibility if your husband is still struggling, and adding that to caring for your family and home can become too much to bear.\n\nI think it's time for a talk with your husband about his expectations in all of this, and to determine what, if anything, he has discussed with his father.\n\nEditing to add: At 75, your FIL may be in very good shape now, but what about down the road?  (Sorry, missed his age the first time around.) The reality is that as he ages, you and your husband may become FIL's care givers.  That needs to be part of the discussion as well.", "NTA.

Adding a person to a household is complex enough. Adding a grieving person on top of another grieving person (on top of grieving children who lost a grandmother and are being neglected emotionally by their dad) is a lot a therapy sessions in the making. Also, FIL has stated he\u2019s lonely, which duh\u2026 he just lost his partner of 50 years. He\u2019s still learning how to function daily without her and his son is over here trying to make unilateral decisions to \u201cfix\u201d something that can\u2019t be fixed. It\u2019s fully possible to be lonely and surrounded by people at the same time. I think if FIL wants to move then they discuss it as a family. I think if FIL wants to stay in his home then instead of the son making dads decisions for him, he helps dad find senior activities, a widow support group, volunteer opportunities, etc so that he gets out and is active in learning to live his life again. Get everybody into some grief counseling and communicate in detail, often so that everybody is on the same page.", " NTA. Before you get coerced into doing this, read some caregiver forums on Reddit and elsewhere. Caregiving is not easy.

I\u2019m betting your husband will want you to do all of these things, especially if you\u2019re a stay at home mom or work fewer hours or have a lower paying job. By all means , find a better living situation for grandpa if he\u2019s unhappy. You can even move him closer to you or maybe to your town, even if it is rural.

They can be very expensive but some aren\u2019t (they can start out very reasonable hoping people stay for years to the end and rent increases as folks need more and more assistance).

I very much appreciate that he is trying to step up for his father. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s a good son, but he has to continue being a good husband and father as well. Wish you and your family the best.", "NAH / NTA\n\nI think that both of your positions are valid. You don't want your FIL to move in with you because you don't want to have to make your two sons share a room again, and you don't want to handle having two grieving men in your home at the same time. Plus there's the added cost of having a sixth person/third adult living in your house, in terms of food and utility usage. \n\nI can understand your husband wanting his Dad to move in with you, too. His Dad is 75 years old. He's not getting any younger. Maybe he doesn't want to live by himself because he's so used to living with someone else (his wife/your MIL). \n\nI do have a few questions.\n\nIs your husband an only child, or does he have any other siblings who would be willing to step up and help?\n\nDoes your FIL actually want to sell his house and move in with you and your husband, or is this just something that your husband wants? \n\nDoes your FIL have any health problems that might make him living by himself more difficult as time goes on? \n\nWhat is your FIL like in terms of personality? Do the two of you get along?", "I think you just need to talk to your husband OP.  I'm sure he doesn't realize that his grief is hard on you.  It's okay to tell him that while you understand his grief and want to support him, it's been hard on you too.  You're worried about the impact of the grief and loss of space on your kids, and you need support sometimes too.  Maybe talking will help you understand each other more.  Maybe having his dad there would ease the grief, not add to it.  Maybe you can set a hard time limit for the sake of your kids.  Whatever the solution is, I think it starts with being open with him.", "NAH. Grief is really really hard. I get why your husband feels this way.. but Pulling the rug out from under your kids is not the way to go about this.\nMaybe your husband can go stay with him for awhile? Would that be a compromise that\u2019s possible? He gets to spend time and help with his father, and you can get a break.\nThat\u2019s what my mom did when my grandpa died. She stayed with my grandma for 10 days to help her get her bearings. It worked out because my mom wasn\u2019t there emotionally for us anyway, being in the house didn\u2019t change that fact. \n\nYour FIL is young. Learning to live independently is huge in grief.

So I'm sympathetic. \n\nLiving alone, regardless of the situation, can be really bad for a single elderly person. The isolation can lead to steep mental decline. And it's becoming more and more common for people to move their parents in in their old age (grandparents living separately is not the historical norm anyway). Plus, since what seems to bother you most is being around the grief, they'd have each other, so it might actually help more than you think. So there are some good reasons to move him in.\n\nYour feelings about it are legit, and you have a right to them. You're going to have to do a LOT of communicating with your husband about this.

I have recently lost a parent - very recently - but I happen to be in a situation where my remaining parent is much younger than your FIL and also surrounded by family and a close friend network. That\u2019s to say though, that outside of that, I understand the grief your husband is going through. \n\nI think your husband has a right to ask if his father can live with you - to be honest, it won\u2019t be easy for him living alone, and there is a lot of anecdotal evidence, in my life at least, that elderly men\u2019s health will decline quickly once their partner dies. Living with you could prevent that, and surround him with love and family in his later years. I totally understand why that would be a priority for your husband. \n\nBut taking in an elderly relative is also a big commitment. Are you willing to make accomodations as his health and mobility do eventually decline? Will you allow him to do supported living and/or palliative care at home when the time comes, or put him into a nursing home? I can\u2019t say you\u2019re an asshole for not wanting these responsibilities, particularly as it would affect your kids. \n\nIf it were me, and I were open to considering it, I would suggest to my husband that we look around for 5 bedroom houses in the area, or a 4 bedroom with a granny flat, or space for one. Look at what the prices are - if you sold your house, and your FIL sold his, would that cover a new buy? To me that at least solves the issue of everyone getting their own space. \n\nI also do think that potentially your dad being around his dad will help them both with their grief. They\u2019ll be able to mourn together, but also to remind each other of all the good memories around their mum/wife, and slowly the low grief will turn into something more manageable. \n\nAlso you could make it a conversation about what you both need - your husband might feel he needs to support his dad, and you need more help - if you give a little, I think it\u2019s fair you can expect him too as well. \n\nSomething I would consider is that your FIL may only be around for 5-10 years.

Entire families live in 2 room homes and they can\u2019t find space for that old man in an entire HOUSE?! \nNah I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t come from such a \u201cdeveloped\u201d country \ud83d\ude44\nPathetic!", "Redditors are notoriously against this kind of thing so can't help but think you were looking for an echo chamber to support your feelings. It would suck for your middle kid, but I'm leaning toward YTA. It's a valuable lesson for your kids to know that you help family when they need it.\n\nYou married this man, and as a result, you married his family. Not wanting two sad men in your house is a legitimately effed up reason to not want to move him in. You could move him in for a set amount of time (maybe a year) with an agreement to find a nice retirement community for him to live in in your area. \n\nImagine how terrible it would be to go from having your partner for 50 YEARS, and then one day, you're totally alone. Devastating. Part of your husband's grieving is feeling worried about his poor dad being alone. For the sake of your marriage (and possibly soul), find a compromise and take the FIL in for at least a few months.", "NAH. You both have solid reasoning, there is no right answer. I'm lucky, my wife was happy to allow my father to move in and she/we takes great care of him. This was her choice and her doing, but to me that is what family is all about, but not everyone is me.", "When you're grieving,  you're not only suffering the loss of the person who died, but also everyone who pulls away from you because you're grieving.  It's so incredibly lonely.", "Info: is there a chance he wants to rent out his father\u2019s house because of money issues? Doesn\u2019t want his dad to go into a retirement home because it means less or no inheritance? \n\nAsk him if his dad sold the house, what happens to the money, where would it go. \n\nAnd his dad might not even want to move if he still has a good social circle where he lives. Not only he would lose his wife, but his life as he knows it too. Is this even something his dad wants?\n\nI think you need to speak to the dad and get his perspective. \n\nFind out if this is about wanting his dad close or if this is about money.", "NTA.  I get that your husband and his father are grieving.  But I agree that there are multiple reasons why quickly moving your FIL into your own house is not the best solution.  Maybe having his dad closer is a good idea for them both, and being near your children might help your FIL.  But not crammed into your house that even after expansion barely fits your own family.  And not at the expense of your own family.  You\u2019re already covering for your husband\u2019s withdrawal from you and the kids, and dealing with your concerns over his work performance.  You have every right not to add a grieving widower into the daily mix, if he is capable of taking care of himself.  I know you said you\u2019re in a rural area\u2014is there a small town nearby that your FIL could settle in (assuming he\u2019s interested) so that he is nearby but also able to socialize?  I hope your husband will get some grief therapy and will open his mind to discussing all the possible solutions with you.", "NTA. In addition to forcing your kids to share a room and having to deal with the heaviness of your FIL\u2019s grief, there would also be another person to clean up after and cook for. Will your husband be doing that or is he expecting you to? \n\nYou don\u2019t mention the state of your FIL\u2019s health, but he is 75, I imagine sometime in the near future he\u2019s also going to need a caretaker or at least help. If your FIL moves in is your husband going to do the caretaking for him or will he expect you to do it? I know if you live in a rural location it might be difficult to find certified help. \n\nHow about doctor\u2019s appointments? Can your FIL drive himself? If he can\u2019t, who would have to do it? How far away is the nearest hospital? Where I grew up the nearest hospital was an hour and half away, when I was in high school I had to start skipping days to take my grandmother to her appointments. \n\nI understand your husband wanting his dad to be closer, but expecting you and your kids to completely disrupt your lives to do that is selfish. I think the idea of moving him to the closest retirement community is probably the best option. It\u2019s closer than where he currently lives. He would have people his age to befriend. And he would be able to get help with his health whenever he ends up needing it.", "NTA. Are there any nearby apartment rentals that might work for your FIL? Close but not too close.", "NTA, kinda. You need to tell him all the reasons and you need to also relax about why he got so far along without telling you. It means he was likely processing it all. \n\nYour alternative for your FIL is likely a better long term solution, so perhaps he could stay with you for a short time, IF NEEDED, while the house sells and the new one is found. \n\nDon\u2019t move all your kids stuff out of the room. Make it clear this is temporary. Have him come perhaps for a week to look at places in your area to live.", "Your husband temporarily carried the weight of your life together when you were in a bad space. You are now holding together your family of 5, as he mourns.\nHis idea of moving in his dad is in no way the same. You didn\u2019t make vows with his dad.\n\nHis dad needs a plan that does not involve him living in your home, or you being his primary caregiver. And believe me it will happen. \n\nWhy isn\u2019t dinner on the table at 530pm sharp?\nDebates, pompous and endless, about mail, politics, TV, young people today. Endless hours spent in the bathroom. \nYour husband will suggest his dad gets the primary bedroom suite for privacy, eventually.\nAnother grown adult doing laundry, bed linens, needing rides, entertainment. And wanting you to provide it. No longer able to entertain because the noise is irritating and DD likes his routine. Endless advice about how to parent, cook, clean. \n\nYou realize your kids could be grown and flown and you may still have your fil living with you?\nMy friend\u2019s 98yo dad still lives with her. Dinner out is 430pm sharp at the Cracker Barrel. He can\u2019t be left alone, he\u2019s mentally sharp but incontinent. They no longer travel. No respite care.  He calls to her constantly if she is out of sight. Her children are educated, married, in their own homes. And Dad is with her. \nNTA\nI would support looking at several plans including renting  nearby, eventually buying, moving into 55and older housing, moving into independent living. But not in your home. \nGood luck.", "Nta", "NTA.  That is a massive change that will completely upheave your life.  And honestly, it doesn\u2019t even sound like your husband knows that\u2019s what your FIL wants.  Especially after losing a wife a change in town and being away from friends and familial places could be incredibly difficult.  And with his age, you need to be aware that depending on his own health there might be a lot of caregiving involved, and if your husband isn\u2019t able to care for his children right now with his grief\u2026 who do you think that role will fall to?  So you have every right to be realistic about your own limitations and boundaries- that\u2019s not selfish.  A retirement home sounds like the best option\n\nThe only other option I would consider (which, with FIL age and the situation I really don\u2019t think is an option) is that FIL uses his money from the sale of his house to move into some kind of prefab home/have a guest house built/trailer on your rural property if there is space.  That way he can have his own space and be near the family if that\u2019s what he wants.  But I wouldn\u2019t be moving him into your home, nor would I be taking that on without setting firm boundaries surrounding what you are and aren\u2019t willing to provide in terms of meals, financial help, nights per week visiting, involvement with the kids, physical and mental support for an elderly person, who might be able to drive him around if he cannot, etc.", "Nta, but maybe if it's possible to either visit him or have him come for maybe a slightly extended visit with his grandkids? I know you say you don't want two grieving people to deal with the grandkids may actually help cheer him up some if he got to spend some quality time with them?", "NTA, but don't expect to move any of your relatives in.", "NTA but I think framing it as \"no never\" was kind of rough. Maybe ask him if you and he can talk about this with his therapist. You and he both know that this can't happen without your consent but you owe it to him to talk it out. Not wanting to add another adult family member to your home is absolutely valid. I think as others suggested, an age-in-place apartment near you, where you can have him over for dinner once or twice a week, he can join in with the kids' activities, that would be a perfect balance.", "NTA.  Have you considered building a small house I have heard them called \u201cgranny pods\u201d on your property? That way he has his space and you guys have your space.", "YTA slightly but only for not openly communicating. - you are not an asshole for saying no, but why can't you be honest with your spouse? Communication is key - your children deserve their own space, why can't you say that?", "It seems as if you just don't want him there and if that's the case say so instead of beating around the bush. This seems more about you not wanting an additional person near you grieving. Doesn't seems as if you guys tried to come to a compromise. Yes, you want your home without caring for someone else, that's fine, but YTA, be straight up!", "NTA", "NTA and I can tell you what will happen his dad will move in and you will have another person to look after, Clean up after cook for etc while your husband will step back and let you do it cause it\u2019s not that hard right?  I have seen it happen over and over again all the time your kid will resent you and grandpa.. it\u2019s a no win situation but your FIL should downsize into a retirement community where he can make friends and have the support of people his own age who are also widows and not become another child for you to look after.  Your husband sees this as a fix for his dad, but you can\u2019t fix grief like that especially at the cost to your own family.", "It\u2019s not a good idea for your FIL. He\u2019d have to leave his friends and his whole life. Your family would be the only people he knows. My father tried it after my Mom passed. He was much happier in a retirement community with people his own age.", "NTA. I get that he's grieving but your husband seems to primarily be thinking of his own feelings at the moment. I understand not wanting his father to be alone. However, has anyone considered or asked your FIL how he feels or what HE wants? 50 years in the same home. His wife may be gone, but its the home he is familiar with and comfortable in. The neighborhood is HIS neighborhood, neighbors he is familiar with. His friends are nearby. If he had hobbies (my FIL met up with his friends and went to Bingo every week. They even went to Atlantic City every couple of months), taking him away from the familiar will do more damage than good. Plus who says he WANTS to move in with teenagers at his age? \n\nIt sounds like your husband is thinking of his own needs and wanting to keep his dad nearby after losing his mom. Your feelings and reasons are valid and you need to voice them.", "NTA. You offered FIL moving into a condo or retirement home but husband said no. Unfortunately, your husband is thinking only through his grief and not logically. Grief counselors always tell mourning family to wait one year before making any rash and/or big life decisions. Moving in husband\u2019s elderly father is a big life decision that can cause displacement and possibly resentment for losing some independence (having your own room is the start of independence). Taking a step back and not rushing these decisions is a great idea. If husband feels this strongly that his dad is too lonely, he needs to be asked first what he is thinking about doing. Then discussing options of retirement homes or condos that are closer to you guys. Or even possibly building a living situation onto your current home for FIL but not moving him in until it is built. Husband and FIL should continue grief counseling.", "YTA. It isn\u2019t because you don\u2019t want him to move in. If that was the only reason I would disagree with you, but you would not be a verified AH. It\u2019s your reasons that make you an AH. You don\u2019t want to deal with his grief? You try to drag your children in as an excuse like they wouldn\u2019t love to have gramps living with them. If you\u2019re raising them right they should feel that way at least. Your father in law literally raised your husband and made him the man you love. You can\u2019t even repay him this?", "Not going to add my opinion on TA thing, however you are being seriously selfish when it comes to your husbands mental health issues. Making it all about your children and you not receiving attention when he is dealing with the grief of his MOTHER and trying to help his surviving father who is obviously struggling too.\nI\u2019m not saying move him in, moving him nearby would be great.\nHowever I have some words of wisdom for the FIL. If he chooses to leave the home he had with his wife for so long and displace himself from all that he has known for most of his life (familiar town, people, friends, neighbors) not to mention the emotional and sentimental ties he may hold to the home, the features of it. I feel he will go through a serious mental withdrawal if he moves and he can\u2019t realize it because he is overrun with the grief from the major loss. Of course everything is sad and depressing when you lose your life partner, however, losing the close memories and sentimental space you shared with them can sometimes do more long term damage mentally than staying and coping.", "Look, man. I really really want to be NTA here, but I just can't do it. YTA. This is devastating to both your husband and his father. To see a parent you adore in that much pain contributes to your overall pain and grief. Maybe suggest a few weeks over instead, where your FIL can maybe get back on his feet and a little more mentally stable. During that time, maybe your hubs and FIL can look for options much closer than 3 hours away. I mean, give something to get something back, you know? I'll be totally down voted, but that's okay. I think you should try to meet in the middle.", "OP, as a senior I get where you are coming from.\n\nMy mom bought a condo, after my dad passed but she was really lonely. So much so, that she choose to ignore a mild stroke, then refused treatment for a bigger stroke and died as a result.\n\nOur household situation is unique. We had a house built 5 years ago to accommodate our son, dil and 2 grandkids. We have private space on the top and bottom floors (we have the bottom, they have the top) as well as a semi private main floor. This means, when my husband or I pass, the remaining parent will have family here. We have doors between us on the main floor and with the exception of the youngest (9) everybody knocks before entering. \n\nBut, moving one of your kids out of their room is just plain wrong. The only workable option to having your fil live with you, would be to have a seperate space in the house! If hubby has his dad close by, they will both be able to move through their grief more easily as hubby will see that dad is ok. Plus, fil will be spending time with his grandkids and it will help him heal AND the kids might enjoy having him there.\n\nOh, yes, NTA but almost!", "YTA, there\u2019s several reasons why but one of them is just a gut feeling that you\u2019re just an asshole in general. The way you word things like \u201cIt was obvious to me that he\u2019s been planning this for a while without talking to me.\u201d I dunno about you but usually when I propose ideas to ANYBODY I usually formulate a plan/ideas and then present it. I don\u2019t come up with some half baked ideas. What does it matter if it\u2019s obvious or not? You make it sound like he\u2019s trying to hide it, for what reason? Also stating \u201cI really don\u2019t a second grieving man in our house\u201d makes it sound like the idea of a man grieving disgusts you. To be fair that\u2019s a stretch from my part but just the way you word shit makes me dislike you. Honestly your reasoning is pathetic and your true feelings are just plain selfish. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best be kind, supportive, and understanding\u201d no you\u2019re not. You\u2019re putting on an act hoping it will blow over soon so you don\u2019t have to deal with it. You sound like an absolute treat of a wife.", "The softest YTA\u2026 while your reasons are incredibly valid and I agree with your conclusion that his Dad should not live with you, you failed to properly communicate with your husband. You didn\u2019t tell him the full truth and as a result you\u2019re both finding it hard to come to a resolution. Your reasons are valid and you have no idea the strain that him moving in could place on your relationship or children. \n\nAs someone who invited a friend to live with my partner and me while he was divorcing his wife\u2026 it can be difficult to live with people who are grieving a loss. It was hard on our relationship and there are a number of factors here that present additional challenges (eg she passed rather than divorce, your husband is also grieving and you have children).", "What if it was you? \nWould you want your sons three hours away? \nWould you want to be left alone after your husband has passed?\n\nIm not saying YTA, but think if you would have been okay if it was you. I know for a fact I would let either my husbands parents or mine move in with us in a heartbeat. They have given us so much. No we are not obligated to, but why not take care of those that has just always been there and has loved us unconditionally.\n\nI dont know your situation or the relationship your husband had with his father over the years, thats also an important consideration. However, putting your kids in one room again is not the end of the world. Ive shared a room with my sister for a very long period.", "YTA- the way you talk about your husbands grief as a burden\u2026 let\u2019s get this straight, he lost his mom \u201clate last year\u201d so November or December of \u201822? That\u2019s barely four months. Give it time. Also, how about you compromise and ask if he can just come stay while keeping his house? What if he sold his place and you guys bought a house with a self enclosed basement or in-law suite and he can pay with the proceeds from his house. Have you thought that maybe having grandfather  around would be good for your kids?", "Maube suggest instead that you guys look into trying to move his father closer instead. That way your husband can pop in n check to see if he's okay and you could invite him round for a weekly dinner. But yeah moving him into the house is not a good idea its not fair for anyone involved especially the kids. Has he even spoken to his father bout this. He may not be too happy bout his son maki g all these plans for him without even consulting him first.  He may not even want to leave his home. When my nan died my granpy stayed in the house they shared together for 40 years and if anyone suggested he leave would've got told to shove it.

That inevitably involves a lot changes to the way the household runs, and to the relationship dynamics. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important to note that not only has the grief limited the time, energy, and attention that your husband has for you and the kids, it also requires some of your time, energy, and attention to care for and support him. And the addition of your FIL would divert some more of those things - you are only human, and no matter how much you love people, we all still have a finite amount of time and energy, and emotional capacity. Grief and depression affect the whole family - not just the person actively experiencing it.\n\nI would add that if you are angry with your husband for suggesting it or thinking it through before talking to you, then that\u2019s an AH move. He\u2019s looking out for his remaining parent, who is hurting; that is totally understandable.", "YTA for not giving your husband a reason beyond a year is too soon, yet you seem to also think at the same time grieving for a year is too long. You also got mad that he came up with a plan to make it feasible before coming to you, which is a reasonable thing to do. The real reason you're mad about it is probably because it was a decent plan and you couldn't simply shut it down with how would we even be able to do that and had to try and come up with a real justification other than your grieving is annoying to me and I don't want to deal with your dad too. Lastly you say he's neglecting your kids but you don't give any examples as to how you also say it's affecting his work but have no reason or evidence to support that. \n\nSo YTA and a selfish one at that", "YTA - your partners mother passed away and the only thing you think of is how itll effect your peace of mind.

I don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m not understanding you. I have a few reasons that I think we should wait and rethink this whole thing next September. Number one, I think it\u2019s unfair of our children to go back to sharing rooms. They\u2019re also grieving the loss of their grandmother, and they need that space to be alone. Number two, I\u2019m not sure that it would help your grief to be around your dad\u2019s grief constantly. Like with our kids I feel like that alone time can be beneficial. It brings you down to be around sadness all the time. Number three, that house is a huge asset your father has. Selling or renting it out would be a huge hassle for not much gain right now. He may need that down to road either to live in or sell for one reason or another. I think right now we should implement some times for us to be more together as a family. Let\u2019s do Sunday night dinners. We\u2019ll cook a roast or order pizzas, have your dad over, and eat and play games or watch a movie together every week. Then come September, we can talk about the logistics of moving our family together if that\u2019s something that you still want to do.\u201c\n\nAnd maybe if that time comes, you should sell FIL\u2019s house and use it to ad an addition with an apartment, or tiny home in your backyard, so FIL can be close by but you still have your own space?", "NTA. Your kids come first and sharing a bedroom well into their teens/until they move out seems a problem for all involved. If you are rural, do you have the land space for a tiny home? Would be cheaper than an apt for the dad, he would be a stones throw away, and you wouldn\u2019t need to kick anyone out of their rooms, and would be only a value add to your property. Something prebuilt with a ground floor bedroom and a bathroom.", "NAH.  I am in my 40s and my mom died last year, so I am kind of in a similar place as your husband.

I anticipate they will be for a while.\n\nI completely understand your husband's desire to do something to help his dad - that is natural and commendable. He also may be feeling vulnerable and looking to hold onto what he has left - and wanting to move his dad into the house could be part of that.\n\nI am also 100% with you about not making any major decisions until you all are farther along in your grieving process.  Taking a step back and letting some time go by is important - because what may seem totally reasonable while you are in the depths of your grieving may not seem reasonable at all later on.  Heck, I thought it would be best for us to move into my mom's house after she died and live there.  No, that wasn't a good idea, I was just trying to hang onto the past that I wasn't ready to let go of yet.  I see that now.  There are still days that I wish I lived in that house and am incredibly sad that I don't - but that's the grief.\n\nYou said your husband has started counseling - this may be something that the counselor can help with - help him see that his motivation is likely driven by grief rather than what makes the most sense for your family, dad included.\n\nEdited to add - I think that not wanting to have 2 grieving men in your house is completely valid and not at all selfish.  That would be a lot to deal with.  I know what my grief process has looked like and sometimes I don't even want to deal with myself.  I certainly wouldn't want to deal with two of me.  And not to put too much stock in gender stereotypes, but as women, we tend to be much better at dealing with emotions and soldiering on than men are.

We don't know that it's only going to be a few months to a year, it could also be a very hard few months to a year. \n\nOne of my good friends, as an adult, had her grandmother move in with her family and they watched her health get worse and worse over her time with them, she was battling a host of health issues while also dealing with dementia. I remember the absolute emotional turmoil it caused my friend.\n\nI believe OP said grandad's health isn't great. As a parent, I would have to think really long and really hard about bringing a grandparent into my house and having my boys watch their grandparent die slowly. I remember being a small child, watching paramedics carry my grandmother's body out of our house in a body bag.\n\nLogic doesn't always work for kids, the part of their brains that understands logic isn't fully developed in any of OP's kids, as a parent their needs to be thought of too.\n\nI don't think OP is the AH, and I don't think her husband is either for deciding on what should happen without talking to her.\n\nI think OP and her husband need to have a lot of very long and, possibly, very hard conversations. All the options need to be explored. I don't know what their situations are, I'm just going off of OPs post and my own experiences.", "He needed to share the thought with her before making a plan because it affects the whole family; instead, he spent time thinking about it and came up with a plan for what he wants to do. \n\nThey needed to have a discussion about the idea and it's impact on the family ad well as the impact of him already not spending time with their kids", "My comment was directed at your mention of \u201ckids have shared rooms since caveman days.\u201d They already shared the room. The room was renovated and furnished for that child. Taking it away basically as soon as they get it (especially with less than 6 months-a year living in that room) will bring resentment. Having grandparents around is great, but OP is not wrong for thinking of her children first. Having a grandparent around does not mean they have to move in. FIL could move someplace down the road. But, we don\u2019t even know if FIL wants this so OP is not wrong for saying \u201cno.\u201d FIL might not want to move from his social circle or the place he made memories. It\u2019s only been a max of 5 months. This is too big of decision to be making right now. If the house can be added onto where everyone still has their own room because FIL wants to move in, that is the best option. If he doesn\u2019t want to move in but wants to be close, finding a house or retirement home closer is the best option. OP said no to FIL moving in and displacing their second child who just got their first taste of independence (own room) which if displaced from, can cause resentment. \n\nOP\u2019s answer was not only no. OP also mentioned the other options: FIL moving closer but into a condo or retirement home so he is closer that way everyone would have their own space and husband said no because FIL would still be alone. But husband isn\u2019t thinking, because FIL wouldn\u2019t be alone in a retirement home. Husband is thinking about his grief, not what is logical and rational. I understand why husband is doing that, but many grief counselors state you cannot make such rash and/or big life decisions so soon to a life changing event (like a family death). \n\nHow does inheritance have anything to do with the discussion at hand? OP said no to moving him in because it will displace everyone and is probably not what everyone wants, maybe just the husband. We don\u2019t know what FIL wants. Even then, OP and husband have to think about their family, the family they created. OP isn\u2019t refusing to make any concessions, the husband is.", "OP offered FIL living in a condo or retirement home and husband said no. Husband unfortunately is thinking about his grief and how to ease that, not what is logical.", "OP did offer alternatives. FIL moving closer into a condo or a retirement home were offered by her, but husband said no.", "It would be different if it was temporary. According to OPs post the husband wants it to be permanent.

Moving in with you will stifle his future as well as yours, he needs to be around people his age who have similar shared experiences. He\u2019s 75, he could have 20 years left! You\u2019re right to not make drastic changes too soon. Grief counseling, he needs that.", "No it isn\u2019t and your second statement is even more absurd. Sure, it means he\u2019s put some thought into it, but no where does that mean he\u2019s decided that\u2019s what is going to happen. What the hell?\n\nEDIT: if my wife came to me and said she wants to move her mom into our house, my first response would be \u201cwell have you put any thought into how that\u2019s going to happen?\u201d.

However, moving his father into the house when mean you are now picking up his slack AND his fathers slack.", "It\u2019s not but there are many immature people on this app", "I know that it's your husband's grief and frustration talking when he throws your PPD in your face, but that is still so very hurtful because depression is beyond your control.  Your husband may say he is depressed or your FIL is depressed bc MIL died, but please remember that you can't compare depression.  As someone with clinical depression, it hurt so bad when my \"moods\" were compared and my husband talked about everything HE did for me.  And why can't I be the giving person now.  It was bad, I ended up divorced after 32 years of marriage.  Everything with my ex could have been handled better, but instead, it broke me.

I'm saying they are different.  When my husband stepped up because I literally couldn't, he was taking care of his children and his own house.  That's not the same as moving an elderly adult into a full house with 3 kids.", "It is different to step up as a partner and parent then to add a person in to the household. It sounds like op is stepping up. However isnt able to deal with adding her fil to her home. Which is fair. Not everyone can live with their parents/in laws. \n\nEveryone deserves support while grieving however everyone has their limit. Thats okay. Especially since grief is a long process.", "The situations are not the same.  I was suffering from a debilitating mental illness.   Grief is terrible, but it's not PPD.  I know, I've dealt with both. Yes, my husband stepped up for a long time and took on the bulk of the household needs.  But that doesn't mean we need to uproot our entire lives when there are other options available to us.", "Have you ever had PPD or known someone who's had PPD? There are mothers, a ton of mothers out there, who had or has PPD and have abused or even killed their children. I feel like it was actually in the children's best interests that she stayed at her mom's and actually got the help she needed. \n\nShe's not saying he needs to get over it like it never happened nor is this the trauma Olympics and we get to pick and choose who's more deserving. This is a tough situation for everyone, her husband, herself, her three kids, and her husband's father especially. There is no clear cut answer but everyone is entitled to their own feelings.", "We do not yet know how close they were, how the children will react in the presence of two grieving adults, how well theyll live in one room. I'm not saying it's necessarily bad but it is a big change for them that can not be overlooked and swept under the rug even though the husband's grieving. There are a lot of unknowns here.", "My thoughts, exactly. They have no sense of family, aside from how it immediately affects them. Karma will not be kind. \n\nThere are so many other options that could be explored before jumping to warehousing a parent, including an ADU. After all, they're rural homeowners. It just boggles the mind.", "No she's looking at how hard it's been for her. She sounds heartless TBH. She can barely deal with her own husband and is worried over her kids sharing a room. She doesn't sound like she cares about her husband or FIl. Wonder if she'd have the same energy if this was her parent.", "Bahahaha\n\nWay to show you can't infer.\n\n\nWant to live with your child as OP's husband's dad....meaning after you're 75, go through tragedy, have ailing health, and need to rely on your children\n\nEveryone's acting like the dad actively has a retirement plan using his son. He didn't. Life happens.", "How is doing things 50-50 picking up the slack?", "Depends. If the OP is bring up how she is stepping now because in his grief he\u2019s absent, it\u2019s fair game for him to bring up when she did the same.", "How have you stepped up?", "Also to me it doesn't sound like she's stepping up it sounds like she's just rushing him to get over it.", "Again, my beef isn't with moving the fil in or not. That's a big decision that needs to be discussed, and I agree with not saying yes right away. My points of contention are she doesn't seem open to actually talking about it because she never gave the husband any reason besides its a short time and my biggest problem is that she's complaining about her husband being \"less attentive\" and  \"bringing the house down\" and can \"barely handle his grief\" but when he wad handling everything when she was dealing with grief and depression that different obviously its to be expected.", "Grief also can lead to depression which is a debilitating mental illness, and if your husband is less attentive to the kids, and not performing well at work like you claim it's a sign it might be more than just grief. Also, the dad complaining about being lonely and not wanting to be in his house anymore can also be a sign of depression. And to be clear, I'm calling you out on the fact that you're saying you can't deal with your husband's grieving more than about the dad moving in. Your story is just when I'm depressed or going through grief he's expected to step up, but now that he's going through grief and possible depression, he needs to get over it.", "Yup you\u2019re an AH.\n\nBecause it wasn\u2019t exactly what you went through doesn\u2019t mean his pain is any less valid. Stop playing the pain olympics, loss affects everyone differently.\n\nThe more I think about it, your just a very unsupportive and selfish spouse.\n\nYou\u2019re arguing that your situation and your ability to deal with it was way worse than your Husbands right now.\n\nSo following that logic, your Husband had a lot more to do in terms of supporting your trauma and the household than you have to do now and you\u2019re moaning about that.\n\nBy your own admission your Husband had to deal with more and you\u2019re not even to partially match his energy?", "100% see where you\u2019re coming from. NAH in my opinion because I thinks it\u2019s fair to assume a bit of irrational thinking from someone that\u2019s grieving like your husband.\n\nI\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve discussed having grandpa come stay for a week or two. Why would you just jump to moving him in? Maybe a good visit and grandkid time every once in a while is enough. Also, can your youngest stay in your room while grandpa is there? It\u2019s not fair to uproot your middle child (and let\u2019s face it, middle kids get the raw end of the deal a lot of the time). \n\nMaybe ask to have this conversation with his therapist?", "Yes, I have experience with PPD and know how dangerous it can be for everyone involved. My point being the husband stepped up durring that time and (up until now) didn't complain about it or when she was grieving about her parents deaths where after she was finally better from her PPD  her mom got sick so she went and lived with her for 3 weeks yet she is complaining about him being less attentive to her and the kids now that he is dealing with a hard time in is life with at the very least grief and possibly even depression. And yes, you're exactly right. This isn't the trauma Olympics where we pick who's more deserving, yet she seems intent on doing that by saying the situations were different and he's just dealing with grief. Seemingly ignoring the fact it could be depression.", "I'm sorry for your loss. It is absolutely harder to be the grieving person, but it is also difficult to be the supporting person. I can also understand OP not wanting to displace her kids again.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf. It doesn't sound like the wife cares at all.", "[deleted]", "But you don't need to offer it as a solution just yet. You could simply ask what he wants to do.", "Because, according to the post, he is no longer doing 50% of the chores. He is doing less because he is dealing with depression. So, she is picking up the extra that he is no longer doing.", "I didn\u2019t take it as complaining more like giving the full picture. For i didn\u2019t see op going on and on about. More like stating this is how her partner been since loosing his mom. Which he is grieving.", "Where did op stated her fil was complaining about being lonely and not wanting to be in his house anymore? I read that her husband was stating wanting to move his dad out for its hard for him. Which is two different things.", "The bottomline is the same. She was depressed, he was depressed. She went to go live with her mother while she was sick, he held down the fort while she was away. Now his mother has passed, he could very well be understandably depressed, but he has now proposed something different. Moving his father in, putting her three growing children in one room (which can and will cause issues later down the line). She's right in saying the situation is a bit different. Otherwise, however, we cannot assume how she is or is not supporting her husband through this situation. The post is too short, the situation is overall too complicated and emotional, we can not accurately deduce how everything is going down. \n\nWe do not know exactly how long ago his mother passed, how long he's been checked out, how long she's had to pick up the slack. Nowhere however did I see her complain. All she said was that she didn't WANT. These are her own personal feelings that could very well not actually guide her actions (being inattentive to her husband's depression/grief). Just as her husband is allowed to grieve, she is allowed to her own private feelings, as harsh as they might be.", "You don't get over grief. It's ALWAYS there.", "I don't think the way the husband went about it is wrong. He came with a plan laid out. If there any problems after that when you compromise. \n\nAnd I agree with you but OP barely mentions her kids she's simply saying she doesn't want to deal with it. If she's saying the father has issues that will disrupt the kids life, or the son never had to share a room before so it's a huge change. \n\nShe isn't focused on that it's just. I already have one sad person I don't want another", "[deleted]", "This is exactly what needs to happen before a call can really be made on who\u2019s the asshole or not.\n\nI would be tempted to say e s h because they\u2019re making decisions for a man who hasn\u2019t even voiced if he even wants to move yet.", "1st off, it would be butting 2 growing children in the same room that were living in the same room up until the summer of last year. Second, she is saying it's going to be a long-term term situation when she also said that the FIL isn't doing well (why the husband wants to move him in with them).  And even said she wished she had spent more time with her mom before she passed while effectively making it harder for her husband to do that with his dad so he doesn't regret it. His mother passed between 3-7 months ago op said late last year and that timefrome is september-december, meaning her husband has been \"checked out,\" as you say, for 3-7 months. Op is saying the situations are 100% different, not a bit different. Also she put in her post in a way that can be perceived as complaining about him not being attentive enough and not being present enough so at the very least she already has an issue with him not being very attentive but if he was to do what she did and leave to be with his father for 3 weeks seems to me that it would turn into I had to do everything while he was gone", "True I see what you mean...yes it's harsh to say but I do understand how OP feels. She said it herself that her husband seems to have \"checked out\" (and understandably so) but while grief seems to stop time for the person afflicted, life still goes on. Right now she seems like an overwhelmed mother of four. she's dealing with three young, growing children and a grieving husband on the side. In this case it's easy to point fingers and say how she should be there for her husband and while there are ways to be there for support, having one child is a demanding task, having three kids is an extreme, two person job. I can see how she wouldn't have the mental space, time, or energy to even see how she could do LIFE with not just one but two grieving adults and three children shoved into one room. \n\nI do disagree about the way the husband went about it though. Regardless, there was a huge life changing event that happened. Right after that we are talking about another life changing event (bringing his father into their home) and that should've been discussed with her from the beginning/when he first started thinking about it. \n\nIt's a tough situation all around. I don't think anyone's the asshole here but regardless of how anyone thinks of it/whoever's side they may take, the children's needs will always have to come first."]}
