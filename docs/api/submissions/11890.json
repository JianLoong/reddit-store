It was very hard on him and his father.  The holidays were rough.  My husband is still struggling and I've been doing my best to be kind, supportive, and understanding.  But he's been less attentive with our 3 kids (14F, 12M, & 9M) and I'm pretty sure he's struggling at work too but he won't admit it.  He started therapy about a month ago and is going once a week.  \n\nA couple weeks ago he brought up to me that he wants to move his dad (75M) into our house.  He said that his dad is struggling too and that being in the house he shared with his wife the past 50-years isn't doing him any good.  He had an entire plan laid out so it was obvious to me that he's been planning this for a while without talking to me about it.  \n\nHe wants to move his dad into the room that we had just moved our middle child into last summer.  Before that, our 2 youngest were sharing a room so we did some renovations to make an extra bedroom so all our kids could have their own space.  He wants to force our 2 youngest to share a room again so his dad can move in.  He also wants to talk to his dad about putting their house on the market or possibly renting it out, which means FIL would be here long-term.  \n\nAfter he laid out his plan, he asked me what I thought and I told him my immediate reaction is \"no.\"  I told him that barely any time has passed since his mom's death and it's too soon to make such drastic changes in everyone's lives.  I told him his dad will get better with time and we all just need to take a step back and not rush into any decisions.  \n\nHe was not happy with my response and kept asking for specific reasons other than \"not enough time has passed.\"  I suggested that we look into different housing options for his dad if he's uncomfortable in his home, which I get.  His dad has enough money saved to afford a good retirement home or smaller condo, which would allow everyone to still have their own space.  He didn't like that idea either because it would mean his dad is still living alone.  \n\nI'll admit, there are reasons I didn't tell him.  Seeing my husband deal with his grief has been hard, especially since it's effecting his ability to be present with me and the kids.  I really don't want a second grieving man in our house.  I also really don't want to kick our middle child out of the room that we just made specifically for them.  That isn't fair to them.  But I know if I tell my husband this, he's going to think I'm being selfish, and maybe I am.  \n\nFIL currently lives about 3 hours away so visiting him is difficult.  We also live in a pretty rural area and the nearest town with respectable retirement homes is over an hour away, so even that option isn't ideally close, but it's still closer.  I know it sounds selfish, but I just don't think I could handle 2 grieving men in my home. I can barely handle one right now.", "created_utc": 1678392907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n2gfm/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_husband_move_his/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I remember her saying that often the parent was offered their place to stay out of grief and guilt and the gesture was poorly thought through. It caused huge amounts of upheaval to the family, caused all sorts of stress, anger and resentment. \nIf everyone is on board then that's different but, here, they're not. This is a big change for everyone and you both need to be in agreement. As others have said, there is more than one option - getting his own home nearer you for one. I love my mum to pieces and we get on so well but I would not want to have her live with me but, if she moved close by, that would be great - I'm close by so could see her regularly and help when needed. I would be happy to help her with housework, shopping etc but, both of us in the same house? No, not happening!\nThe loss for your husband is still quite recent and I hope he finds his way again and you can reach a compromise you can all live with.", "Nta. You have equal decision power. Perhaps share our concern with husband not being available to you and kids? Let him know you ask for time becauae he is still grieving", "NTA, I don't think it's ever a good idea to move a grandfather into the house. They deserve respect but they're old people and they struggle with adapting to new shared spaces. My grandpa went to live with her favourite daughter (my aunt) and their 3 kids (all adults) and it ended up in total shipwreck. He died with my aunt refusing to see him. Bringing him closer is a good idea but I would wait some more and investigate other close by options.", "YTA \n\nImagine if it were your parents and he reacted the way you would. You love your husband but don't want to deal with him in his grief. Terrible.", "Yta for just saying no and not really wanting to make any compromise with your husband. You admitted your ideas weren't great. It's just about you and what you want. You don't seem to be taking your husband's feeling or concerns into consideration at all. Just no.", "NTA, your FIL and husband are suffering.  However, making a huge move, basically ripping FIL away from his friends and familiar environment, and basically isolating him in a rural area is not healthy.", "When my step-dad passed away, my mom tried to live in their home by herself during covid.  She was grieving, and she was lonely.  She now lives in a retirement home, and she is much happier.  She still has all her friends and has made new ones, is still independent, they go places, and she has help if she needs it. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your home too and the home of your children - that\u2019s important too. \n\nI think a further conversation with your husband about his distance from your children since his Mum passed is in order as that may help him see your side but that will be a tough conversation. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t been much time at all but I don\u2019t think it will be a short while before this gets any better. I hope everything works out.", "NTA in that moving a person into a household should be a household decision, especially when it concerns a drastic living situation change for 2 of your children and appears to be permanent.\n\nI think as other commenters have said, a reasonable compromise would be for FIL to buy a small place close by.\n\nI did have massive AH vibes when you were worrying about how your grieving husband wasn't being attentive enough and how you couldn't cope with 2 grieving men. As someone who recently lost a parent, it's devastating and your husband will need time, love and support to move through his grief and it appears from the way you have written this that you aren't willing or able to give as much of this as he might need.", "NTA, it has to be two yes or he doesn\u2019t move in. I wouldn\u2019t want to live in my parents or even my in laws either. I love them but in their own homes. Time really hasn\u2019t passed yet, he has to ride the wave. Maybe look into housing closer to you guys, but his main priority should be you and his kids. Sorry he\u2019s not grieving healthy.", "Has your husband even discussed this with his father? for one everyone says wait a year to make big decisions about life after an event like that. For another who says this man wants to leave his home of 50 years? It seems like your husband is projecting his own grief and trying to \"fix\" the problem when it just needs to be processed. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Forget about the grieving, your first responsibility is to your kids.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, you need to put your three kids needs first.  I'm sure taking care of the kids is quite demanding all by itself.  The very last thing you need is another person who needs to be taken care of.  \n\nAnd if your AH husband wants his dad to sell his house, clearly he's intending you to \"take care of him\" instead of moving him into a retirement home.  While you have three kids to take care of.\n\nYour husband is absolutely an AH **for planning this out at length without even talking to you about it.**  \n\nI'd say make this your hill to die on.  You have your hands full.", "NAH\n\nI get where you\u2019re both coming from! \n\nYoure totally valid in your reasoning, whether it\u2019s selfish or not. You shouldn\u2019t have to uproot your kids in order to house his dad. \n\nBut that\u2019s also his dad and he\u2019s far away and really struggling rn. I would drop anything to help my dad, and I think it\u2019s actually a sign of good character that your husband wants to take care of his dad\n\nAlso, i think y\u2019all are struggling with communication more than anything. He\u2019s your husband, you should be able to be honest about your concerns. Staying quiet truly serves no one", "NAH - I understand your concerns, and I also understand why you\u2019d be hesitant with making your youngest live together again. I\u2019m sure this would all be a hard adjustment on your kids, so thank you for considering their feelings and keeping them at the forefront. As parents, that\u2019s ultimately your main responsibility!\n\nHowever, I understand your husband\u2019s point of view as well. His father is alone, grieving, and he wants to help him. It\u2019s great that your husband is willing to take in his elderly grieving father. Them being together might help your husband in his grieving process as well, so this is important for both of them. The grieving process is hard and long, and it hasn\u2019t been very long at all for either of them.\n\nI think both of your emotions are running high. Be kind and compassionate to him while still making your points about this being a big adjustment for the kids. I *do* think it\u2019s important for his dad to move closer to all of you, whether that\u2019s in the same house or a place nearby. This is something you both need to work out, with his father\u2019s and your children\u2019s input as well; they might want grandpa around! They might not mind sharing again if it means he gets to live with them, kids can be very empathetic. \n\nRemember, it\u2019s the both of you working against this hurdle and supporting each other, *not* you vs. him. You both need each other.", "NAH. Regardless of the decision, it is never smart to make a big decision right after an event like that. \n\nHe should not have done all this planning before talking to you, but a hard no is also a little harsh for someone grieving. Saying you need time to process such a big and permanent decision could be better.\n\nIt would not be fair to the kids, but that doesn't mean there can't be more compromise. \n\nIs there a small house or apartment near you that is renting? This way, you can be closer without making the kids share a room.", "NTA - it's rightly said that one should not make major life decisions for a year following a loss such as this.  Your FIL is not in any sort of a hardship situation, such as needing care, etc.  You have offered a perfectly rational alternative such a s a different home/condo.  It could even be close by where husband and FIl could spend time together and FIL could have more contact with grandkids, which might be of help to him and good for the kids.  You might point out to your husband that taking away your child's room at this point for a non-urgent need is NOT going to endear Gramps to that child.\n\nYour husband is grieving and it's good that he's getting help but I really think this is a hill to die on.  Nothing radical to be done for one year and even then, if you don't feel it's a good idea, then it shouldn't happen.  For all you know, this is the prelude to you having to take over as a full time caregiver as FIL ages.  If you are not up for that, stand your ground.", "When it was time to move my grandmother in, my parents added on to the house and my aunts helped pay. Is something like this an option?", "NTA\n\nYour responsibility is to your kids. You might want to remind your husband of that too. It would be a completely different situation if the father couldn't afford to live alone but that didn't seem to be the case", "NTA\n\nHow are you being selfish by prioritizing your child over a grown man?? It's awful your MIL has passed away. I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nMaking both your children share a room after you _just_ renovated so they didn't have to do that would create resentment in your home.\n\nYour husband is allowed to grieve but when you have children you can't just peace out.  \n\nI think your solution to having him move closer makes lots of sense. Everyone stays independent but then your husband can visit your FIL much easier.", "NTA. \n\nThe first thing that strikes me is that it wouldn't be fair to your children, who just go their own rooms. Sure, lots of kids share and even have tinier spaces to deal with, but in this case, you just presented them with their own rooms AND they went through a process to get there, so taking them away creates sadness, confusion, and probably some animosity. That animosity is a particularly bad thing when you have TWO grieving people in the home who will be the focus of that animosity. \n\nSecond, your husband is barely meeting his duties now- not judging- and wants to add another person to the mix, and all signs point to his father also being your responsibility. Even if the guy is nice and plucky for 75, who is going to move the stuff, who is going to help him get situated, who is going to grocery shop for him, feed him, do all the stuff of getting him to your house, settled, and getting rid of his stuff/other house? It's gonna be you. This man is added work at a time when you have too much already. \n\nAnd finally, yes, the multiple grieving men is a valid reason. \n\nYou need to be more honest with your husband- I know you are struggling with losing your mom, but that struggle has been passed on to me in various ways. You are checked out, I am alone doing X, Y, Z. Now you come to me with a very big thing and I don't think I can handle it. I can't handle caring for another person, and given how you have been, it will be on me. I think it will impact the children negatively as they just got their own rooms, and I can't handle more negativity in this home.", "Why not compromise he stays with you for 6 months while he finds a closer place , your husband will not having to carry the guilt of his dad being alone and hael quicker", "I\u2019m gonna go NAH\n\nHe\u2019s thinking about the well-being of his father and you are thinking about the well-being of you and your children. It\u2019s a tough decision to make but you\u2019re going to have to make one soon. I suggest being completely honest. Not in a mean way but if this will really impact the wellbeing of your children, that needs to be taken into consideration. Can another room be turned into a space for him so that everyone can be happy? Try to come up with compromises.", "YTA. At 75, surrounded by his grandchildren he has a chance of moving out of his grief and into a new family relationship with his son and grandchildren. He is more likely to be better, not worse. Your husband will also be better because he won\u2019t be worried about his dad and having to drive hours and hours to go check up on him. You\u2019ll get to spend more time with your children which is what you\u2019re complaining about he isn\u2019t doing.\n\nThis could be a temporary situation. Give your husband and his father some time to heal, and then make a decision about whether you all want to get a larger living situation maybe with a Inlaw apartment or if he\u2019s ready to move back home.", "NAH. It's a big change for everyone.", "Not wanting to live with your in laws is reason enough. He should just get his own place nearby. NTA.", "NTA...Adding your FIL to your household would be a major disruption to your household. Your husband assumed you'd say yes, but you don't have to.", "NTA but you need to give your husband all of your reasons. He kept his pans from you but that doesn't mean you keep this from him. Be open and be calm.", "I cannot believe anyone is saying Y T A to not wanting your FIL to move in permanently. We don't even know he would want that. Living with someone, never mind pushing your kids back into sharing a room indefinitely, is a *big deal*.\n\nHard NTA. I think you all having a discussion about him selling up and buying a smaller place nearby is a way better option.", "YTA. I can see your points. But it sounds selfish to me.", "I'm kind of split here. There's lots about what what you wrote that screams I just don't want to deal with supporting my husband when he needs me to but there's also a good case that this would be very disruptive to yours and your children's lives. He also should have been talking to you before this about his plans. Maybe you should come to an arrangement where he moves in with a time limit on that. Not 100% sold on this but ESH....", "ESH.  Your husband should have spoken to you first; not last.  I am not sure how I feel about your not wanting to move his father in, but don't be surprised when he or your children put you in a home.", "YTA.\n\n1. It's responsible of your husband to create a plan and a pitch to you rather than just asking with no plan. It enables a good discussion.\n2. When he asked you for feedback, you just said \"no\". It's okay to have boundaries and to share boundaries, but ultimatums and zero negotiation stances are not team player moves.\n3. \"not enough time has passed\" is a terrible thing to say on your end. Your FIL spent his whole life with his late wife, and now you get to assign a grief period? WTF is that? His grief will take its time, and he needs support.\n4. You not wanting to see two people grieving is a pretty selfish reason to say no with no room to negotiate. They're grieving, and that's annoying to you- not exactly supportive behavior.\n\nThere are middle ground options. Buy FIL a trailer to live in at your house while finding independent arrangements for him. Move to a new home that can accommodate everyone. Other options, other ideas. You just say no out of hand and don't try to help in any way, and have only selfish reasons listed here.", "Grief is tough. You only have one mother. It\u2019s not a loss that you just get over in a few months. You frame this process like it\u2019s a struggle for you to be empathetic. Similarly, his father lost his life partner of 50 years. I cannot imagine having so little empathy for my husbands only remaining parent that stuffing him in a retirement home hours away is a reasonable solution. It\u2019s beyond selfish\u2014 it\u2019s cruel. Life is about change. Just like a relationship changes with the introduction of children, it changes as we navigate grief and loss with our partners. \n\nThere is NAH when one partner wants an aging parent to move into the home and the other partner wants to explore other options. You are married though. His family and obligations are your family and obligations. He is the grandfather to your children. Being near them will help him and by extension your husband. It doesn\u2019t have to take away from your life, it can add even more joy. \n\nWhat makes YTA here is everything is about you not wanting to \u201cdeal with\u201d your husband and his fathers \u201cemotions\u201d like losing a foundational person in their life should just be gotten over without anyone in your family having to help carry any of the grief. Perhaps you should explore why you have such a negative view of your husband (and his father) showing emotions.", "NTA. Don't let these comments guilt you for valid feelings. It's hard to live with a grieving person. I lost my dad in 2022 and I have been insufferable for my family to be around, I know this. So I can see how your husband's grief is affecting your family. I agree that moving FIL in your home may make this issue persist. I read another comment that mentioned getting him an apartment near your family, that sounds like a reasonable compromise.", "YTA\n\nI work in a nursing home\n\n\nWe have a resident who\u2019s been there for 5 years, he and his wife came together. She passed 6 months after arriving, leaving him there alone. Everyday he wanders the hall in his wheelchair asking every single person if they have seen his wife because he can\u2019t find her. He was lucid and perfectly cognizant when she died. The grief literally broke his brain.  I can\u2019t imagine making such a selfish choice. Do you think he wants to deal with the grief? Or wants to rely on his sons family? Probably fucking not, but sometimes we just have to deal with shit.", "NTA. Have Dad move nearby, visit with him regularly.", "YTA:  it seems your only reasoning is \"I don't want to deal with it\".......sounds like an asshole to me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not yet anyway. It sounds like your husband is wanting to make decision without consulting you *or* his father.  Grief counseling  and some meeting of the minds need to take place first. Your father in law may loathe the idea. The 1 hour away sounds good to me if it is assisted living with ready access to a grocery store and other things an independent senior citizen needs.", "ESH. \n\nThose decisions need to be discussed together and not just at the end. \nYou need to treat your FIL better. If you have enough room, what about building a small annexe to the house, like a secondary house with a bedroom, bathroom, ideally a living room and small kitchen. This way he can have his own space, your kids keep their bedroom, but he is still living with you and everyone can jump in whenever needed.", "NTA\n\nYour husband and FIL need to get into grief counseling immediately. What your husband is trying to do is not going to help anyone, not even his father. It's a knee jerk reaction to seeing one of his parents alone after decades of not being alone. It's an unfamiliar and uncomfortable sight and that's normal.\n\nBut the new normal should not be to move everyone in together. As long as his father is capable of taking care of himself, there's no reason to do this.", "NTA Tell him you\u2019re willing to revisit his proposal in a year.

This is adding to your husband\u2019s stress, worry, & grief.There is a solution, but you have to think of someone besides yourself. Maybe you can add on. Maybe a neighbor would rent a room.Kids have shared rooms since caveman days.   \n\n\nPersonally, I would show the love & compassion I want to be shown by my husband & kids. You\u2019re going to need help someday also.", "NTA. I think there\u2019s a reasonable compromise here. I like that you phrased it that \u201cmy initial reaction is no\u201d because that lacks the finality and keeps the discussion going. I don\u2019t think you need to necessarily give ground here, but you could talk about moving his father closer. If there isn\u2019t a good retirement community nearby, surely there is at least an apartment complex that you could move him into temporarily. Then you could be open to the father selling the home and building a mother-in-law unit onto your own home with that money. Your husband is likely not just grieving his mom, but also grieving the situation that his father is now in and feeling like his father should be closer, and regretting that his father is so far away and going through this alone. So moving the father closer might also help your husband through his grief. And having the grandkids close by might work wonders for your FIL grief too. I think you can work out a compromise here that helps everyone without compromising your own wishes for your own children.", "NTA.  I was in a similar situation.  My now-ex wanted to move his dad in with us.  I was 6 months pregnant and we were getting ready to move.  I said no. One day, ex went to \"visit\" his dad and just brought him home and moved him in.  I ended up having to provide care for him after a surgery, he only showered when told to, he smoked, and he stank.  I should have been preparing for our baby and instead I was caring for someone I didn't even like, much less want living with us.\n\nYour family, meaning you/husband/kids, comes first. If you have the space and want him there, that's one thing.  But you don't have the space.  He could sell his home and move closer.", "YTA - how insufferable. You must be one of those \u201cfor better\u201d only people", "INFO does your FIL actually want to move?", "YTA here, although I'm not saying you should move your FIL here. But you 1) aren't giving your husband space and time to grieve, and 2) completely shut him down when tried to talk to you. Yes, he had obviously been planning this for a while before talking to you. But look what happened when he did talk to you! \n\nImagine that one of your parents died. You're worried about the remaining parent and struggling to deal with your own grief. Meanwhile your husband is complaining about you not pulling your weight around the house or working hard enough. How would you feel?\n\nYou need to step back and examine how you can support your husband right now. Have an honest conversation with him about his FIL instead of just shutting him down.", "NTA. 75 isn\u2019t that old. Moving him in just makes it easier for him to sit in his grief. He would be better served by grief counseling or grief groups. My dad is 92 and going strong so you could be committing to a couple of decades.", "YTA. I get how you are feeling but it really is heartless. If your FIL sells his house can you put an addition on your home to give him his own room. Then you son would only have to give up his room for a little while?", "Ouch.  \"My husband is grieving over his dead mother, and it's so annoying!  Less attention for me, how dare he?!?  And if his dad moves in, there will be two annoying men, not just one, yuck!\"\n\nYTA, and extremely selfish.", "NTA \n\nHowever, I understand your husband\u2019s intentions, and you should help him find a solution.\nThere must be a compromise where your FIL moves closer, your kid keeps his room, and you don\u2019t have two grieving men in your house.\n\nTalk to your husband openly. Tell him you understand he is grieving, but this is impacting you and your family also. Without an open talk, you won\u2019t find a solution.", "NAH. This is a hard situation. And a huge life change for everyone. You both have some valid points. I hope you two can figure out how to sit down and talk with each other openly. Be honest with each other. Give each other the benefit of the doubt. Maybe you can make it work, maybe you can't, maybe you can find a compromise. I'm sorry, I'm sure this is a hard situation.", "Your perspective and hesitation are valid, but just as your SO would be the AH if he 'insisted' on his father moving in, YTA for 'refusing'. You don't come across in this post as being very patient or empathetic. It sounds like the loss is quite fresh, within the last 6 months, and your husband is rightly concerned for how his father, aging and now living alone 3 hours away, is faring. That might even be contributing to his level distraction you observed with the kids. \n\nHowever moving your FIL in long-term or permanently is not the answer, necessarily. You should have another conversation in which you explore the options with your husband. Maybe FIL living in a supportive facility that offers him socialization, being 1 hour away instead of 3, would be a better option. Maybe having him live with you for a short period, say 3-6 months, especially in conjunction with planning his longer-term living arrangements whether that is selling his home for a condo or something else, would work well. Maybe there are other family members with whom it would make more sense for him to spend time. Also have a frank discussion about what you can expect for responsibilities, schedule impacts, etc. from having FIL live with you for even a short period of time, with the expectation that it is shared and temporary.\n\nBut I think you need to double down on the patience and empathy for your SO and FIL. While you are rightly worried for your own mental health, burden, and the impact on your kids, as a spouse and partner to your husband, you need to be more compassionate of his grief and the time it will take for him to get back to normal.", "NTA. Your reasons are valid and you should bring them up with your husband. Discuss how it makes you uncomfortable and you really have no rooms to spare. I doubt your two sons would be thrilled to move back to sharing a room. Children need their private space to call their own as they get older. I grew up sharing a room with my older sister. When we moved I had the possibility of having my own separate room, but, wishy washily, I chose to keep the status quo and the remaining room became my mum's sewing room and guest room. In hindsight, I wish I had taken up the offer.\n\nYour post made me think once again that neighbourhoods should be zoned for double housing on one lot and that the options of building a granny/in-law suite should be offered. Would you be able to afford that (with your FIL's help maybe)? You would have your house as it is and your FIL would have his own space with the ability for visits (and... psssstttt... help around the house too \ud83d\ude09)", "NTA.\n\nThe house belongs to you too, and it is the boys' home.  It's definitely not fair to the kids to give away their space and make them share a bathroom with an old man, even if he is their grandfather, without their input.\n\nMy FIL died 2.5 years ago, and my MIL has spent about 5-6 months of that time visiting us in our house.  She sold the house she bought in 2021 and is with us again temporarily.  It's not easy, and has nothing to do with grief--and we are empty nesters with a spare bedroom.\n\nMIL has an offer on a house about 30 minutes away, and should be moving out next month.  We plan and hope to visit her at least a couple times a week, but that's not 24/7.\n\nI would highly recommend your FIL sell his house and get a small home or condo near to you.", "Back atcha kiddo", "I mean that sounds like a you problem.", "She doesn\u2019t want to deal with his father\u2019s grief. They don\u2019t have an extra room for his father, either.", "Moving an additional person into the house, *especially with minor children*, is a two yes/one no situation. Given the rooming situation that OP described, this would have long term effects on the middle child who would be sacrificed for the FIL who is old enough to take care of himself. \n\nThe compromise here would be FIL selling his house to move closer to the family, not moving him into their own house. \n\nNTA", "I don't think it's being an asshole to acknowledge that processing grief means you have less emotional space to be present for your wife and family. Like it's not a judgement, it's just a fact. Nor do I think it's being an asshole to not want two people deeply consumed by grief who thus have less energy to contribute to the household. It's not a moral judgement, it's just how things work. OP does love her husband, she just also loves her kids and has to take care of them and do more parenting because he's processing his grief. It's exhausting even though it's necessary. You can love someone and empathize with them and be exhausted and a little frustrated all at once.", "He\u2019s not gonna be there for just 6 months and when OP wants him out he and her husband will gang up on her", "The husband didn't go behind her back or anything all he did was think \"I should move my dad in with us because he's having a hard time\" then made a plan to present to his wife to make it feasible so that it was I want to move my dad in and help him, and this is how we can do it vs I want to move my dad in idk how well do it but well figure it out.", "Ops husband didn't speak to her last all he did was before speaking to her or anyone for that matter he came up with a plan so the conversation wasn't I want to move my dad in, but I don't know how we just need to figure it out.", "Absolutely agree with this. Best way to put it!", "I think this is the correct and most empathetic response. OP isn\u2019t TA for being apprehensive about moving a parent in \u2014 that\u2019s a HUGE decision, and has a lot of implications for their lives. But I\u2019m seriously side eyeing all the \u201cugh, grieving men\u201d remarks. His mother is gone. His father is 75. He could still live a good long while, maybe. But the assumption that he\u2019ll get better is also a bit deluded.", "That is completely heartbreaking.", "In fairness, you WORK in a nursing home. You get to leave at the end of the day and go home. Taking in an elderly parent is a big deal and can be pretty consuming especially if they start to become sick or frail or demented. OP already has young children that she had to take care of and maybe this isn\u2019t 100% of the time, but I feel that often times, it\u2019s the wife who ends up doing the bulk of the elder care regardless of whose parent it is. \n\nShe is definitely NTA and I think it\u2019s entirely reasonable to propose other housing alternates.", "Op has three kids though...what you're describing is tragic, yes, but doesn't account for the three children in the house.", "Why should she and the kids have to change their whole lives? This is a death that dad and grandpa should have been prepared to deal with eventually and dad needs to think about his own family. It sounds like their house is too small as it is.", "This is the answer I was looking for. Something definitely needs to happen to make dads life easier and closer to family but it doesn\u2019t need to negatively impact your children by taking away their space. \nMaybe - if he needs to be with people who can help him like in a home - you can talk about using the money from the house sale to add a mother in law unit on your house for dad so he\u2019s within help\u2019s reach but still has his own space.", "The same could be said for husband.   He started a family also.      His first responsibility  is to wife and kids.     His grieving has made him less attentive and she has picked up the slack  with kids and household chores.   Now he wants to move his father in so she has yet another person to care for?", "Nope! You're ignoring the growing children in this situation. Following that logic, when you do start a family, you have to consider the needs of your immediate family as top priority. Shoving three growing children in one even decently sized room is a huge drastic change. Especially when you add two grieving adults.", "I'm thinking it more like she is worried she'll have to take care of his father and the kids needs also it sounds like husband is not willing to compromise either. I understand not wanting to take away from her kid again. But I understand his grieve too. Still does not give him the right to plan something and think it is ok. She does sound as if she needs more empathy. My judgment ESH.", ">Broken-heart syndrome is real, and this may save your FIL's life.\n\nSadly, I know this to be true.  My dad passed away suddenly shortly after our oldest was born.  I was struggling with PPD and wasn't there for my mom nearly as much as I should have/wanted to.  Within 6 months my mom was in hospice care.  By that time, I was doing better and stayed with her for 3 weeks before she passed.  I have a lot of regret about not being there for my mom when she needed me, but I my priority at that time, and now, are my kids and their well-being.", "That was my thought as well. The husband is working on himself in therapy but it may take him a bit longer to be the parent to his kids that he was before.  OP should continue to encourage him and give him grace on that front.\nIt also wasn't unreasonable for the husband to start thinking of elder care for his dad, after all, the loss of his mom is quite recent and is probably making him think about his dad's mortality too. My mom is now 87 and we're all reckoning now with the fact that living by herself isn't as tenable for her as it was before.\nDon't be mad at your husband for working on creative ideas to take care of his last surviving parent. Instead, help him come up with other ideas that will work well for everyone.  Perhaps a small apartment add-on to your house or perhaps a guest cottage might be doable if the dad wants to chip in and zoning rules permit\nMaybe there are good apartments or condos nearby.", "To me it doesn't sound like he's trying to make a decision without consulting anyone. To me it sounds like he wants to do this and thought about how it would even be possible before bringing it up so that it wasn't just a \"hey I want to do this but I don't know how yet.\" Not to mention he litteraly consulted with her about it without making an official decision. He's trying to have a conversation with her and the only response she's giving about is no it's only been a year since you're mom died your dad will be fine and get over it if we just let him be. Then he asked gmfor a reason beyond it hasn't been \"long enough\" which is honestly ridiculous. The op also never stopped to consider that her husband is probably also distracted by the fact that 1 he can't keep an eye on his dad because he's so far away and 2 possibly feels bad about not spending enough time with his mom before she died since she was so far away.", "It\u2019s unfair of her husband to place the burden of caring for another person on her, especially when he\u2019s been absent due to grief. She clearly is showing her husband plenty of love and compassion, but it\u2019s not fair to disrupt her life and their children\u2019s lives.
