It was very hard on him and his father.  The holidays were rough.  My husband is still struggling and I've been doing my best to be kind, supportive, and understanding.  But he's been less attentive with our 3 kids (14F, 12M, & 9M) and I'm pretty sure he's struggling at work too but he won't admit it.  He started therapy about a month ago and is going once a week.  \n\nA couple weeks ago he brought up to me that he wants to move his dad (75M) into our house.  He said that his dad is struggling too and that being in the house he shared with his wife the past 50-years isn't doing him any good.  He had an entire plan laid out so it was obvious to me that he's been planning this for a while without talking to me about it.  \n\nHe wants to move his dad into the room that we had just moved our middle child into last summer.  Before that, our 2 youngest were sharing a room so we did some renovations to make an extra bedroom so all our kids could have their own space.  He wants to force our 2 youngest to share a room again so his dad can move in.  He also wants to talk to his dad about putting their house on the market or possibly renting it out, which means FIL would be here long-term.  \n\nAfter he laid out his plan, he asked me what I thought and I told him my immediate reaction is \"no.\"  I told him that barely any time has passed since his mom's death and it's too soon to make such drastic changes in everyone's lives.  I told him his dad will get better with time and we all just need to take a step back and not rush into any decisions.  \n\nHe was not happy with my response and kept asking for specific reasons other than \"not enough time has passed.\"  I suggested that we look into different housing options for his dad if he's uncomfortable in his home, which I get.  His dad has enough money saved to afford a good retirement home or smaller condo, which would allow everyone to still have their own space.  He didn't like that idea either because it would mean his dad is still living alone.  \n\nI'll admit, there are reasons I didn't tell him.  Seeing my husband deal with his grief has been hard, especially since it's effecting his ability to be present with me and the kids.  I really don't want a second grieving man in our house.  I also really don't want to kick our middle child out of the room that we just made specifically for them.  That isn't fair to them.  But I know if I tell my husband this, he's going to think I'm being selfish, and maybe I am.  \n\nFIL currently lives about 3 hours away so visiting him is difficult.  We also live in a pretty rural area and the nearest town with respectable retirement homes is over an hour away, so even that option isn't ideally close, but it's still closer.  I know it sounds selfish, but I just don't think I could handle 2 grieving men in my home. I can barely handle one right now.", "created_utc": 1678392907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n2gfm/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_husband_move_his/", "score": 7306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I remember her saying that often the parent was offered their place to stay out of grief and guilt and the gesture was poorly thought through. It caused huge amounts of upheaval to the family, caused all sorts of stress, anger and resentment. \nIf everyone is on board then that's different but, here, they're not. This is a big change for everyone and you both need to be in agreement. As others have said, there is more than one option - getting his own home nearer you for one. I love my mum to pieces and we get on so well but I would not want to have her live with me but, if she moved close by, that would be great - I'm close by so could see her regularly and help when needed. I would be happy to help her with housework, shopping etc but, both of us in the same house? No, not happening!\nThe loss for your husband is still quite recent and I hope he finds his way again and you can reach a compromise you can all live with.", "Nta. You have equal decision power. Perhaps share our concern with husband not being available to you and kids? Let him know you ask for time becauae he is still grieving", "NTA, I don't think it's ever a good idea to move a grandfather into the house. They deserve respect but they're old people and they struggle with adapting to new shared spaces. My grandpa went to live with her favourite daughter (my aunt) and their 3 kids (all adults) and it ended up in total shipwreck. He died with my aunt refusing to see him. Bringing him closer is a good idea but I would wait some more and investigate other close by options.", "YTA \n\nImagine if it were your parents and he reacted the way you would. You love your husband but don't want to deal with him in his grief. Terrible.", "Yta for just saying no and not really wanting to make any compromise with your husband. You admitted your ideas weren't great. It's just about you and what you want. You don't seem to be taking your husband's feeling or concerns into consideration at all. Just no.", "NTA, your FIL and husband are suffering.  However, making a huge move, basically ripping FIL away from his friends and familiar environment, and basically isolating him in a rural area is not healthy.", "When my step-dad passed away, my mom tried to live in their home by herself during covid.  She was grieving, and she was lonely.  She now lives in a retirement home, and she is much happier.  She still has all her friends and has made new ones, is still independent, they go places, and she has help if she needs it. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your home too and the home of your children - that\u2019s important too. \n\nI think a further conversation with your husband about his distance from your children since his Mum passed is in order as that may help him see your side but that will be a tough conversation. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t been much time at all but I don\u2019t think it will be a short while before this gets any better. I hope everything works out.", "NTA in that moving a person into a household should be a household decision, especially when it concerns a drastic living situation change for 2 of your children and appears to be permanent.\n\nI think as other commenters have said, a reasonable compromise would be for FIL to buy a small place close by.\n\nI did have massive AH vibes when you were worrying about how your grieving husband wasn't being attentive enough and how you couldn't cope with 2 grieving men. As someone who recently lost a parent, it's devastating and your husband will need time, love and support to move through his grief and it appears from the way you have written this that you aren't willing or able to give as much of this as he might need.", "NTA, it has to be two yes or he doesn\u2019t move in. I wouldn\u2019t want to live in my parents or even my in laws either. I love them but in their own homes. Time really hasn\u2019t passed yet, he has to ride the wave. Maybe look into housing closer to you guys, but his main priority should be you and his kids. Sorry he\u2019s not grieving healthy.", "Has your husband even discussed this with his father? for one everyone says wait a year to make big decisions about life after an event like that. For another who says this man wants to leave his home of 50 years? It seems like your husband is projecting his own grief and trying to \"fix\" the problem when it just needs to be processed. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Forget about the grieving, your first responsibility is to your kids.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, you need to put your three kids needs first.  I'm sure taking care of the kids is quite demanding all by itself.  The very last thing you need is another person who needs to be taken care of.  \n\nAnd if your AH husband wants his dad to sell his house, clearly he's intending you to \"take care of him\" instead of moving him into a retirement home.  While you have three kids to take care of.\n\nYour husband is absolutely an AH **for planning this out at length without even talking to you about it.**  \n\nI'd say make this your hill to die on.  You have your hands full.", "NAH\n\nI get where you\u2019re both coming from! \n\nYoure totally valid in your reasoning, whether it\u2019s selfish or not. You shouldn\u2019t have to uproot your kids in order to house his dad. \n\nBut that\u2019s also his dad and he\u2019s far away and really struggling rn. I would drop anything to help my dad, and I think it\u2019s actually a sign of good character that your husband wants to take care of his dad\n\nAlso, i think y\u2019all are struggling with communication more than anything. He\u2019s your husband, you should be able to be honest about your concerns. Staying quiet truly serves no one", "NAH - I understand your concerns, and I also understand why you\u2019d be hesitant with making your youngest live together again. I\u2019m sure this would all be a hard adjustment on your kids, so thank you for considering their feelings and keeping them at the forefront. As parents, that\u2019s ultimately your main responsibility!\n\nHowever, I understand your husband\u2019s point of view as well. His father is alone, grieving, and he wants to help him. It\u2019s great that your husband is willing to take in his elderly grieving father. Them being together might help your husband in his grieving process as well, so this is important for both of them. The grieving process is hard and long, and it hasn\u2019t been very long at all for either of them.\n\nI think both of your emotions are running high. Be kind and compassionate to him while still making your points about this being a big adjustment for the kids. I *do* think it\u2019s important for his dad to move closer to all of you, whether that\u2019s in the same house or a place nearby. This is something you both need to work out, with his father\u2019s and your children\u2019s input as well; they might want grandpa around! They might not mind sharing again if it means he gets to live with them, kids can be very empathetic. \n\nRemember, it\u2019s the both of you working against this hurdle and supporting each other, *not* you vs. him. You both need each other.", "NAH. Regardless of the decision, it is never smart to make a big decision right after an event like that. \n\nHe should not have done all this planning before talking to you, but a hard no is also a little harsh for someone grieving. Saying you need time to process such a big and permanent decision could be better.\n\nIt would not be fair to the kids, but that doesn't mean there can't be more compromise. \n\nIs there a small house or apartment near you that is renting? This way, you can be closer without making the kids share a room.", "NTA - it's rightly said that one should not make major life decisions for a year following a loss such as this.  Your FIL is not in any sort of a hardship situation, such as needing care, etc.  You have offered a perfectly rational alternative such a s a different home/condo.  It could even be close by where husband and FIl could spend time together and FIL could have more contact with grandkids, which might be of help to him and good for the kids.  You might point out to your husband that taking away your child's room at this point for a non-urgent need is NOT going to endear Gramps to that child.\n\nYour husband is grieving and it's good that he's getting help but I really think this is a hill to die on.  Nothing radical to be done for one year and even then, if you don't feel it's a good idea, then it shouldn't happen.  For all you know, this is the prelude to you having to take over as a full time caregiver as FIL ages.  If you are not up for that, stand your ground.", "When it was time to move my grandmother in, my parents added on to the house and my aunts helped pay. Is something like this an option?", "NTA\n\nYour responsibility is to your kids. You might want to remind your husband of that too. It would be a completely different situation if the father couldn't afford to live alone but that didn't seem to be the case", "NTA\n\nHow are you being selfish by prioritizing your child over a grown man?? It's awful your MIL has passed away. I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nMaking both your children share a room after you _just_ renovated so they didn't have to do that would create resentment in your home.\n\nYour husband is allowed to grieve but when you have children you can't just peace out.  \n\nI think your solution to having him move closer makes lots of sense. Everyone stays independent but then your husband can visit your FIL much easier.", "NTA. \n\nThe first thing that strikes me is that it wouldn't be fair to your children, who just go their own rooms. Sure, lots of kids share and even have tinier spaces to deal with, but in this case, you just presented them with their own rooms AND they went through a process to get there, so taking them away creates sadness, confusion, and probably some animosity. That animosity is a particularly bad thing when you have TWO grieving people in the home who will be the focus of that animosity. \n\nSecond, your husband is barely meeting his duties now- not judging- and wants to add another person to the mix, and all signs point to his father also being your responsibility. Even if the guy is nice and plucky for 75, who is going to move the stuff, who is going to help him get situated, who is going to grocery shop for him, feed him, do all the stuff of getting him to your house, settled, and getting rid of his stuff/other house? It's gonna be you. This man is added work at a time when you have too much already. \n\nAnd finally, yes, the multiple grieving men is a valid reason. \n\nYou need to be more honest with your husband- I know you are struggling with losing your mom, but that struggle has been passed on to me in various ways. You are checked out, I am alone doing X, Y, Z. Now you come to me with a very big thing and I don't think I can handle it. I can't handle caring for another person, and given how you have been, it will be on me. I think it will impact the children negatively as they just got their own rooms, and I can't handle more negativity in this home.", "Why not compromise he stays with you for 6 months while he finds a closer place , your husband will not having to carry the guilt of his dad being alone and hael quicker", "I\u2019m gonna go NAH\n\nHe\u2019s thinking about the well-being of his father and you are thinking about the well-being of you and your children. It\u2019s a tough decision to make but you\u2019re going to have to make one soon. I suggest being completely honest. Not in a mean way but if this will really impact the wellbeing of your children, that needs to be taken into consideration. Can another room be turned into a space for him so that everyone can be happy? Try to come up with compromises.", "YTA. At 75, surrounded by his grandchildren he has a chance of moving out of his grief and into a new family relationship with his son and grandchildren. He is more likely to be better, not worse. Your husband will also be better because he won\u2019t be worried about his dad and having to drive hours and hours to go check up on him. You\u2019ll get to spend more time with your children which is what you\u2019re complaining about he isn\u2019t doing.\n\nThis could be a temporary situation. Give your husband and his father some time to heal, and then make a decision about whether you all want to get a larger living situation maybe with a Inlaw apartment or if he\u2019s ready to move back home.", "NAH. It's a big change for everyone.", "Not wanting to live with your in laws is reason enough. He should just get his own place nearby. NTA.", "NTA...Adding your FIL to your household would be a major disruption to your household. Your husband assumed you'd say yes, but you don't have to.", "NTA but you need to give your husband all of your reasons. He kept his pans from you but that doesn't mean you keep this from him. Be open and be calm.", "I cannot believe anyone is saying Y T A to not wanting your FIL to move in permanently. We don't even know he would want that. Living with someone, never mind pushing your kids back into sharing a room indefinitely, is a *big deal*.\n\nHard NTA. I think you all having a discussion about him selling up and buying a smaller place nearby is a way better option.", "YTA. I can see your points. But it sounds selfish to me.", "[deleted]", "ESH.  Your husband should have spoken to you first; not last.  I am not sure how I feel about your not wanting to move his father in, but don't be surprised when he or your children put you in a home.", "YTA.\n\n1. It's responsible of your husband to create a plan and a pitch to you rather than just asking with no plan. It enables a good discussion.\n2. When he asked you for feedback, you just said \"no\". It's okay to have boundaries and to share boundaries, but ultimatums and zero negotiation stances are not team player moves.\n3. \"not enough time has passed\" is a terrible thing to say on your end. Your FIL spent his whole life with his late wife, and now you get to assign a grief period? WTF is that? His grief will take its time, and he needs support.\n4. You not wanting to see two people grieving is a pretty selfish reason to say no with no room to negotiate. They're grieving, and that's annoying to you- not exactly supportive behavior.\n\nThere are middle ground options. Buy FIL a trailer to live in at your house while finding independent arrangements for him. Move to a new home that can accommodate everyone. Other options, other ideas. You just say no out of hand and don't try to help in any way, and have only selfish reasons listed here.", "Grief is tough. You only have one mother. It\u2019s not a loss that you just get over in a few months. You frame this process like it\u2019s a struggle for you to be empathetic. Similarly, his father lost his life partner of 50 years. I cannot imagine having so little empathy for my husbands only remaining parent that stuffing him in a retirement home hours away is a reasonable solution. It\u2019s beyond selfish\u2014 it\u2019s cruel. Life is about change. Just like a relationship changes with the introduction of children, it changes as we navigate grief and loss with our partners. \n\nThere is NAH when one partner wants an aging parent to move into the home and the other partner wants to explore other options. You are married though. His family and obligations are your family and obligations. He is the grandfather to your children. Being near them will help him and by extension your husband. It doesn\u2019t have to take away from your life, it can add even more joy. \n\nWhat makes YTA here is everything is about you not wanting to \u201cdeal with\u201d your husband and his fathers \u201cemotions\u201d like losing a foundational person in their life should just be gotten over without anyone in your family having to help carry any of the grief. Perhaps you should explore why you have such a negative view of your husband (and his father) showing emotions.", "NTA. Don't let these comments guilt you for valid feelings. It's hard to live with a grieving person. I lost my dad in 2022 and I have been insufferable for my family to be around, I know this. So I can see how your husband's grief is affecting your family. I agree that moving FIL in your home may make this issue persist. I read another comment that mentioned getting him an apartment near your family, that sounds like a reasonable compromise.", "**ESH\n\nI work in a nursing home\n\n\nWe have a resident who\u2019s been there for 5 years, he and his wife came together. She passed 6 months after arriving, leaving him there alone. Everyday he wanders the hall in his wheelchair asking every single person if they have seen his wife because he can\u2019t find her. He was lucid and perfectly cognizant when she died. The grief literally broke his brain.  I can\u2019t imagine making such a selfish choice. Do you think he wants to deal with the grief? Or wants to rely on his sons family? Probably fucking not, but sometimes we just have to deal with shit.\n\n\nESH because nowhere do I see what the man in question wants mentioned anywhere in this post.", "NTA.

Not yet anyway. It sounds like your husband is wanting to make decision without consulting you *or* his father.  Grief counseling  and some meeting of the minds need to take place first.

I like that you phrased it that \u201cmy initial reaction is no\u201d because that lacks the finality and keeps the discussion going. I don\u2019t think you need to necessarily give ground here, but you could talk about moving his father closer. If there isn\u2019t a good retirement community nearby, surely there is at least an apartment complex that you could move him into temporarily. Then you could be open to the father selling the home and building a mother-in-law unit onto your own home with that money. Your husband is likely not just grieving his mom, but also grieving the situation that his father is now in and feeling like his father should be closer, and regretting that his father is so far away and going through this alone. So moving the father closer might also help your husband through his grief. And having the grandkids close by might work wonders for your FIL grief too. I think you can work out a compromise here that helps everyone without compromising your own wishes for your own children.", "NTA.  I was in a similar situation.  My now-ex wanted to move his dad in with us.  I was 6 months pregnant and we were getting ready to move.  I said no. One day, ex went to \"visit\" his dad and just brought him home and moved him in.  I ended up having to provide care for him after a surgery, he only showered when told to, he smoked, and he stank.  I should have been preparing for our baby and instead I was caring for someone I didn't even like, much less want living with us.\n\nYour family, meaning you/husband/kids, comes first.

But look what happened when he did talk to you! \n\nImagine that one of your parents died. You're worried about the remaining parent and struggling to deal with your own grief. Meanwhile your husband is complaining about you not pulling your weight around the house or working hard enough. How would you feel?\n\nYou need to step back and examine how you can support your husband right now.

I get how you are feeling but it really is heartless. If your FIL sells his house can you put an addition on your home to give him his own room.

Tell him you understand he is grieving, but this is impacting you and your family also. Without an open talk, you won\u2019t find a solution.", "NAH. This is a hard situation. And a huge life change for everyone. You both have some valid points. I hope you two can figure out how to sit down and talk with each other openly. Be honest with each other.

I'm sorry, I'm sure this is a hard situation.", "Your perspective and hesitation are valid, but just as your SO would be the AH if he 'insisted' on his father moving in, YTA for 'refusing'. You don't come across in this post as being very patient or empathetic. It sounds like the loss is quite fresh, within the last 6 months, and your husband is rightly concerned for how his father, aging and now living alone 3 hours away, is faring. That might even be contributing to his level distraction you observed with the kids. \n\nHowever moving your FIL in long-term or permanently is not the answer, necessarily. You should have another conversation in which you explore the options with your husband. Maybe FIL living in a supportive facility that offers him socialization, being 1 hour away instead of 3, would be a better option. Maybe having him live with you for a short period, say 3-6 months, especially in conjunction with planning his longer-term living arrangements whether that is selling his home for a condo or something else, would work well. Maybe there are other family members with whom it would make more sense for him to spend time. Also have a frank discussion about what you can expect for responsibilities, schedule impacts, etc. from having FIL live with you for even a short period of time, with the expectation that it is shared and temporary.\n\nBut I think you need to double down on the patience and empathy for your SO and FIL. While you are rightly worried for your own mental health, burden, and the impact on your kids, as a spouse and partner to your husband, you need to be more compassionate of his grief and the time it will take for him to get back to normal.", "NTA. Your reasons are valid and you should bring them up with your husband. Discuss how it makes you uncomfortable and you really have no rooms to spare. I doubt your two sons would be thrilled to move back to sharing a room. Children need their private space to call their own as they get older. I grew up sharing a room with my older sister. When we moved I had the possibility of having my own separate room, but, wishy washily, I chose to keep the status quo and the remaining room became my mum's sewing room and guest room. In hindsight, I wish I had taken up the offer.\n\nYour post made me think once again that neighbourhoods should be zoned for double housing on one lot and that the options of building a granny/in-law suite should be offered.

Your husband isn't thinking straight because of his grief. It would be different if you had a spare bedroom. \n\nYou're probably also doing the majority of the family labor right now, and one more person, being a senior and all, is going to just be that much more weight on your shoulders and you can't carry everyone around you like that. It's healthy to recognize your limits, and I hope that your husband can understand.", "NTA, not even close. The fact that DH came to you with a fully formed plan rather than talking you through it from the very beginning is a problem. \n\nAlso, what\u2019s his plan for the extra labor and expenses his father creates? Who\u2019s doing FILs laundry and cooking? What\u2019s the plan for WHEN he needs additional care? Who is helping him with doctor appointments, personal care, errands, shopping? If DH pushes that onto you for the kids he will \ud83d\udcaf do it for elder care. This is a hill you die on - voice of experience here, it can crush you, crush your family, and it could last for years or even decades, swallowing your family and marriage whole. \n\nUpending your family life as a knee jerk for DH to try to fix his grief and guilt is not ok. Individual therapy for him, couples therapy for you both, and if he pushes this - rethink things. If he\u2019s expecting you to pick up this load, your health is on the line.", "NAH.\n\nYou are all grieving here, some more than others.\n\nYour husband is worried about his father being alone, which is understandable.  But has your husband actually talked with his father about moving into your home?  Is it something his father actually wants?  Being in the house he shared with his wife for 50+ years is probably a mixed bag for your FIL.  Those memories can be overwhelming as well as comforting.  Also, making a big change so soon after your MIL's passing might not be a good idea.  It may be too much too soon for FIL.\n\nI agree that it might be upsetting to your kids to have their lives upended right now as well.  Are they close to their grandparents?  Are they missing their grandmother?  And yes, asking a 12 year old to move back in with his younger sibling permanently will probably cause resentment.  Your kids are as much of a priority as your FIL, and maybe even more so.  If FIL being there were to be a temporary thing, moving your two sons into the same room wouldn't be the worst thing, but a permanent change might be too much.\n\nI'm glad your husband is starting counseling.  Losing a parent is hard, and it brings on a lot of different emotions, and it can make thinking clearly difficult.  But please give him a break. He is going to be more withdrawn and not so present with you and the kids.  Counseling should help with that.  For now, you're going to need to shoulder more responsibility while your husband works through his grief, and you need to be able to talk about this with your kids.\n\nYour concerns about your FIL's moving into the house are valid.  You don't address it in your post, but is he able to live independently? Does he have health concerns that need to be addressed? Has he been so depressed that he can't function?  Would you have to assume care-taking responsibilities?  Do you generally get along and have a good relationship?  You're going to be the one taking responsibility if your husband is still struggling, and adding that to caring for your family and home can become too much to bear.\n\nI think it's time for a talk with your husband about his expectations in all of this, and to determine what, if anything, he has discussed with his father.\n\nEditing to add: At 75, your FIL may be in very good shape now, but what about down the road?  (Sorry, missed his age the first time around.) The reality is that as he ages, you and your husband may become FIL's care givers.  That needs to be part of the discussion as well.", "NTA.

Adding a person to a household is complex enough. Adding a grieving person on top of another grieving person (on top of grieving children who lost a grandmother and are being neglected emotionally by their dad) is a lot a therapy sessions in the making. Also, FIL has stated he\u2019s lonely, which duh\u2026 he just lost his partner of 50 years. He\u2019s still learning how to function daily without her and his son is over here trying to make unilateral decisions to \u201cfix\u201d something that can\u2019t be fixed. It\u2019s fully possible to be lonely and surrounded by people at the same time. I think if FIL wants to move then they discuss it as a family. I think if FIL wants to stay in his home then instead of the son making dads decisions for him, he helps dad find senior activities, a widow support group, volunteer opportunities, etc so that he gets out and is active in learning to live his life again. Get everybody into some grief counseling and communicate in detail, often so that everybody is on the same page.", " NTA. Before you get coerced into doing this, read some caregiver forums on Reddit and elsewhere. Caregiving is not easy.

I\u2019m betting your husband will want you to do all of these things, especially if you\u2019re a stay at home mom or work fewer hours or have a lower paying job. By all means , find a better living situation for grandpa if he\u2019s unhappy. You can even move him closer to you or maybe to your town, even if it is rural.

They can be very expensive but some aren\u2019t (they can start out very reasonable hoping people stay for years to the end and rent increases as folks need more and more assistance).

Moving him in with your family is not the best answer.", "NAH\n\nYou both have valid reasons and it needs to be more of a discussion and compromise. Perhaps asking him to wait another 3 months and see how his dad is feeling at that point.

I very much appreciate that he is trying to step up for his father. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s a good son, but he has to continue being a good husband and father as well. Wish you and your family the best.", "NAH / NTA\n\nI think that both of your positions are valid. You don't want your FIL to move in with you because you don't want to have to make your two sons share a room again, and you don't want to handle having two grieving men in your home at the same time. Plus there's the added cost of having a sixth person/third adult living in your house, in terms of food and utility usage. \n\nI can understand your husband wanting his Dad to move in with you, too. His Dad is 75 years old. He's not getting any younger. Maybe he doesn't want to live by himself because he's so used to living with someone else (his wife/your MIL). \n\nI do have a few questions.\n\nIs your husband an only child, or does he have any other siblings who would be willing to step up and help?\n\nDoes your FIL actually want to sell his house and move in with you and your husband, or is this just something that your husband wants? \n\nDoes your FIL have any health problems that might make him living by himself more difficult as time goes on? \n\nWhat is your FIL like in terms of personality?

It's okay to tell him that while you understand his grief and want to support him, it's been hard on you too.  You're worried about the impact of the grief and loss of space on your kids, and you need support sometimes too.  Maybe talking will help you understand each other more.  Maybe having his dad there would ease the grief, not add to it.  Maybe you can set a hard time limit for the sake of your kids.  Whatever the solution is, I think it starts with being open with him.", "NAH. Grief is really really hard. I get why your husband feels this way.. but Pulling the rug out from under your kids is not the way to go about this.\nMaybe your husband can go stay with him for awhile? Would that be a compromise that\u2019s possible? He gets to spend time and help with his father, and you can get a break.\nThat\u2019s what my mom did when my grandpa died. She stayed with my grandma for 10 days to help her get her bearings. It worked out because my mom wasn\u2019t there emotionally for us anyway, being in the house didn\u2019t change that fact. \n\nYour FIL is young. Learning to live independently is huge in grief.

You signed up to live with your husband and kids, not his dad.\n\nA lot of people take in a parent but only if they have room. Making another room so your kids no longer share, then making them share Indefinitely is a bad move.

So I'm sympathetic. \n\nLiving alone, regardless of the situation, can be really bad for a single elderly person. The isolation can lead to steep mental decline. And it's becoming more and more common for people to move their parents in in their old age (grandparents living separately is not the historical norm anyway). Plus, since what seems to bother you most is being around the grief, they'd have each other, so it might actually help more than you think. So there are some good reasons to move him in.\n\nYour feelings about it are legit, and you have a right to them. You're going to have to do a LOT of communicating with your husband about this.

I have recently lost a parent - very recently - but I happen to be in a situation where my remaining parent is much younger than your FIL and also surrounded by family and a close friend network. That\u2019s to say though, that outside of that, I understand the grief your husband is going through. \n\nI think your husband has a right to ask if his father can live with you - to be honest, it won\u2019t be easy for him living alone, and there is a lot of anecdotal evidence, in my life at least, that elderly men\u2019s health will decline quickly once their partner dies. Living with you could prevent that, and surround him with love and family in his later years. I totally understand why that would be a priority for your husband. \n\nBut taking in an elderly relative is also a big commitment. Are you willing to make accomodations as his health and mobility do eventually decline? Will you allow him to do supported living and/or palliative care at home when the time comes, or put him into a nursing home? I can\u2019t say you\u2019re an asshole for not wanting these responsibilities, particularly as it would affect your kids. \n\nIf it were me, and I were open to considering it, I would suggest to my husband that we look around for 5 bedroom houses in the area, or a 4 bedroom with a granny flat, or space for one. Look at what the prices are - if you sold your house, and your FIL sold his, would that cover a new buy? To me that at least solves the issue of everyone getting their own space. \n\nI also do think that potentially your dad being around his dad will help them both with their grief. They\u2019ll be able to mourn together, but also to remind each other of all the good memories around their mum/wife, and slowly the low grief will turn into something more manageable. \n\nAlso you could make it a conversation about what you both need - your husband might feel he needs to support his dad, and you need more help - if you give a little, I think it\u2019s fair you can expect him too as well. \n\nSomething I would consider is that your FIL may only be around for 5-10 years.

I get that your husband and his father are grieving.  But I agree that there are multiple reasons why quickly moving your FIL into your own house is not the best solution.  Maybe having his dad closer is a good idea for them both, and being near your children might help your FIL.  But not crammed into your house that even after expansion barely fits your own family.  And not at the expense of your own family.  You\u2019re already covering for your husband\u2019s withdrawal from you and the kids, and dealing with your concerns over his work performance.  You have every right not to add a grieving widower into the daily mix, if he is capable of taking care of himself.

In addition to forcing your kids to share a room and having to deal with the heaviness of your FIL\u2019s grief, there would also be another person to clean up after and cook for.

If your FIL moves in is your husband going to do the caretaking for him or will he expect you to do it? I know if you live in a rural location it might be difficult to find certified help. \n\nHow about doctor\u2019s appointments? Can your FIL drive himself? If he can\u2019t, who would have to do it? How far away is the nearest hospital? Where I grew up the nearest hospital was an hour and half away, when I was in high school I had to start skipping days to take my grandmother to her appointments. \n\nI understand your husband wanting his dad to be closer, but expecting you and your kids to completely disrupt your lives to do that is selfish. I think the idea of moving him to the closest retirement community is probably the best option. It\u2019s closer than where he currently lives. He would have people his age to befriend.

And believe me it will happen. \n\nWhy isn\u2019t dinner on the table at 530pm sharp?\nDebates, pompous and endless, about mail, politics, TV, young people today. Endless hours spent in the bathroom. \nYour husband will suggest his dad gets the primary bedroom suite for privacy, eventually.\nAnother grown adult doing laundry, bed linens, needing rides, entertainment. And wanting you to provide it. No longer able to entertain because the noise is irritating and DD likes his routine. Endless advice about how to parent, cook, clean. \n\nYou realize your kids could be grown and flown and you may still have your fil living with you?\nMy friend\u2019s 98yo dad still lives with her. Dinner out is 430pm sharp at the Cracker Barrel. He can\u2019t be left alone, he\u2019s mentally sharp but incontinent. They no longer travel. No respite care.

And honestly, it doesn\u2019t even sound like your husband knows that\u2019s what your FIL wants.  Especially after losing a wife a change in town and being away from friends and familial places could be incredibly difficult.  And with his age, you need to be aware that depending on his own health there might be a lot of caregiving involved, and if your husband isn\u2019t able to care for his children right now with his grief\u2026 who do you think that role will fall to?  So you have every right to be realistic about your own limitations and boundaries- that\u2019s not selfish.  A retirement home sounds like the best option\n\nThe only other option I would consider (which, with FIL age and the situation I really don\u2019t think is an option) is that FIL uses his money from the sale of his house to move into some kind of prefab home/have a guest house built/trailer on your rural property if there is space.  That way he can have his own space and be near the family if that\u2019s what he wants.  But I wouldn\u2019t be moving him into your home, nor would I be taking that on without setting firm boundaries surrounding what you are and aren\u2019t willing to provide in terms of meals, financial help, nights per week visiting, involvement with the kids, physical and mental support for an elderly person, who might be able to drive him around if he cannot, etc.", "Nta, but maybe if it's possible to either visit him or have him come for maybe a slightly extended visit with his grandkids?

Maybe ask him if you and he can talk about this with his therapist. You and he both know that this can't happen without your consent but you owe it to him to talk it out.

I think as others suggested, an age-in-place apartment near you, where you can have him over for dinner once or twice a week, he can join in with the kids' activities, that would be a perfect balance.", "NTA.

Communication is key - your children deserve their own space, why can't you say that?", "It seems as if you just don't want him there and if that's the case say so instead of beating around the bush. This seems more about you not wanting an additional person near you grieving. Doesn't seems as if you guys tried to come to a compromise. Yes, you want your home without caring for someone else, that's fine, but YTA, be straight up!", "NTA", "NTA and I can tell you what will happen his dad will move in and you will have another person to look after, Clean up after cook for etc while your husband will step back and let you do it cause it\u2019s not that hard right?  I have seen it happen over and over again all the time your kid will resent you and grandpa.. it\u2019s a no win situation but your FIL should downsize into a retirement community where he can make friends and have the support of people his own age who are also widows and not become another child for you to look after.  Your husband sees this as a fix for his dad, but you can\u2019t fix grief like that especially at the cost to your own family.", "It\u2019s not a good idea for your FIL. He\u2019d have to leave his friends and his whole life. Your family would be the only people he knows. My father tried it after my Mom passed. He was much happier in a retirement community with people his own age.", "NTA. I get that he's grieving but your husband seems to primarily be thinking of his own feelings at the moment. I understand not wanting his father to be alone. However, has anyone considered or asked your FIL how he feels or what HE wants? 50 years in the same home. His wife may be gone, but its the home he is familiar with and comfortable in. The neighborhood is HIS neighborhood, neighbors he is familiar with. His friends are nearby. If he had hobbies (my FIL met up with his friends and went to Bingo every week. They even went to Atlantic City every couple of months), taking him away from the familiar will do more damage than good. Plus who says he WANTS to move in with teenagers at his age? \n\nIt sounds like your husband is thinking of his own needs and wanting to keep his dad nearby after losing his mom. Your feelings and reasons are valid and you need to voice them.", "NTA. You offered FIL moving into a condo or retirement home but husband said no. Unfortunately, your husband is thinking only through his grief and not logically. Grief counselors always tell mourning family to wait one year before making any rash and/or big life decisions. Moving in husband\u2019s elderly father is a big life decision that can cause displacement and possibly resentment for losing some independence (having your own room is the start of independence). Taking a step back and not rushing these decisions is a great idea. If husband feels this strongly that his dad is too lonely, he needs to be asked first what he is thinking about doing. Then discussing options of retirement homes or condos that are closer to you guys. Or even possibly building a living situation onto your current home for FIL but not moving him in until it is built. Husband and FIL should continue grief counseling.", "YTA. It isn\u2019t because you don\u2019t want him to move in. If that was the only reason I would disagree with you, but you would not be a verified AH. It\u2019s your reasons that make you an AH. You don\u2019t want to deal with his grief? You try to drag your children in as an excuse like they wouldn\u2019t love to have gramps living with them. If you\u2019re raising them right they should feel that way at least. Your father in law literally raised your husband and made him the man you love. You can\u2019t even repay him this?", "Not going to add my opinion on TA thing, however you are being seriously selfish when it comes to your husbands mental health issues. Making it all about your children and you not receiving attention when he is dealing with the grief of his MOTHER and trying to help his surviving father who is obviously struggling too.\nI\u2019m not saying move him in, moving him nearby would be great.\nHowever I have some words of wisdom for the FIL. If he chooses to leave the home he had with his wife for so long and displace himself from all that he has known for most of his life (familiar town, people, friends, neighbors) not to mention the emotional and sentimental ties he may hold to the home, the features of it. I feel he will go through a serious mental withdrawal if he moves and he can\u2019t realize it because he is overrun with the grief from the major loss. Of course everything is sad and depressing when you lose your life partner, however, losing the close memories and sentimental space you shared with them can sometimes do more long term damage mentally than staying and coping.", "Look, man. I really really want to be NTA here, but I just can't do it. YTA. This is devastating to both your husband and his father. To see a parent you adore in that much pain contributes to your overall pain and grief. Maybe suggest a few weeks over instead, where your FIL can maybe get back on his feet and a little more mentally stable. During that time, maybe your hubs and FIL can look for options much closer than 3 hours away. I mean, give something to get something back, you know? I'll be totally down voted, but that's okay. I think you should try to meet in the middle.", "OP, as a senior I get where you are coming from.\n\nMy mom bought a condo, after my dad passed but she was really lonely. So much so, that she choose to ignore a mild stroke, then refused treatment for a bigger stroke and died as a result.\n\nOur household situation is unique. We had a house built 5 years ago to accommodate our son, dil and 2 grandkids. We have private space on the top and bottom floors (we have the bottom, they have the top) as well as a semi private main floor. This means, when my husband or I pass, the remaining parent will have family here. We have doors between us on the main floor and with the exception of the youngest (9) everybody knocks before entering. \n\nBut, moving one of your kids out of their room is just plain wrong. The only workable option to having your fil live with you, would be to have a seperate space in the house! If hubby has his dad close by, they will both be able to move through their grief more easily as hubby will see that dad is ok. Plus, fil will be spending time with his grandkids and it will help him heal AND the kids might enjoy having him there.\n\nOh, yes, NTA but almost!", "YTA, there\u2019s several reasons why but one of them is just a gut feeling that you\u2019re just an asshole in general. The way you word things like \u201cIt was obvious to me that he\u2019s been planning this for a while without talking to me.\u201d I dunno about you but usually when I propose ideas to ANYBODY I usually formulate a plan/ideas and then present it. I don\u2019t come up with some half baked ideas. What does it matter if it\u2019s obvious or not? You make it sound like he\u2019s trying to hide it, for what reason? Also stating \u201cI really don\u2019t a second grieving man in our house\u201d makes it sound like the idea of a man grieving disgusts you. To be fair that\u2019s a stretch from my part but just the way you word shit makes me dislike you. Honestly your reasoning is pathetic and your true feelings are just plain selfish. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best be kind, supportive, and understanding\u201d no you\u2019re not.

Your reasons are valid and you have no idea the strain that him moving in could place on your relationship or children. \n\nAs someone who invited a friend to live with my partner and me while he was divorcing his wife\u2026 it can be difficult to live with people who are grieving a loss. It was hard on our relationship and there are a number of factors here that present additional challenges (eg she passed rather than divorce, your husband is also grieving and you have children).", "What if it was you? \nWould you want your sons three hours away? \nWould you want to be left alone after your husband has passed?\n\nIm not saying YTA, but think if you would have been okay if it was you.

No we are not obligated to, but why not take care of those that has just always been there and has loved us unconditionally.\n\nI dont know your situation or the relationship your husband had with his father over the years, thats also an important consideration. However, putting your kids in one room again is not the end of the world. Ive shared a room with my sister for a very long period.", "YTA- the way you talk about your husbands grief as a burden\u2026 let\u2019s get this straight, he lost his mom \u201clate last year\u201d so November or December of \u201822? That\u2019s barely four months. Give it time. Also, how about you compromise and ask if he can just come stay while keeping his house? What if he sold his place and you guys bought a house with a self enclosed basement or in-law suite and he can pay with the proceeds from his house. Have you thought that maybe having grandfather  around would be good for your kids?", "Maube suggest instead that you guys look into trying to move his father closer instead. That way your husband can pop in n check to see if he's okay and you could invite him round for a weekly dinner. But yeah moving him into the house is not a good idea its not fair for anyone involved especially the kids. Has he even spoken to his father bout this. He may not be too happy bout his son maki g all these plans for him without even consulting him first.  He may not even want to leave his home.

That inevitably involves a lot changes to the way the household runs, and to the relationship dynamics. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important to note that not only has the grief limited the time, energy, and attention that your husband has for you and the kids, it also requires some of your time, energy, and attention to care for and support him. And the addition of your FIL would divert some more of those things - you are only human, and no matter how much you love people, we all still have a finite amount of time and energy, and emotional capacity. Grief and depression affect the whole family - not just the person actively experiencing it.\n\nI would add that if you are angry with your husband for suggesting it or thinking it through before talking to you, then that\u2019s an AH move. He\u2019s looking out for his remaining parent, who is hurting; that is totally understandable.", "YTA for not giving your husband a reason beyond a year is too soon, yet you seem to also think at the same time grieving for a year is too long. You also got mad that he came up with a plan to make it feasible before coming to you, which is a reasonable thing to do. The real reason you're mad about it is probably because it was a decent plan and you couldn't simply shut it down with how would we even be able to do that and had to try and come up with a real justification other than your grieving is annoying to me and I don't want to deal with your dad too. Lastly you say he's neglecting your kids but you don't give any examples as to how you also say it's affecting his work but have no reason or evidence to support that. \n\nSo YTA and a selfish one at that", "YTA - your partners mother passed away and the only thing you think of is how itll effect your peace of mind.

I don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m not understanding you. I have a few reasons that I think we should wait and rethink this whole thing next September. Number one, I think it\u2019s unfair of our children to go back to sharing rooms. They\u2019re also grieving the loss of their grandmother, and they need that space to be alone. Number two, I\u2019m not sure that it would help your grief to be around your dad\u2019s grief constantly. Like with our kids I feel like that alone time can be beneficial. It brings you down to be around sadness all the time. Number three, that house is a huge asset your father has. Selling or renting it out would be a huge hassle for not much gain right now. He may need that down to road either to live in or sell for one reason or another. I think right now we should implement some times for us to be more together as a family. Let\u2019s do Sunday night dinners. We\u2019ll cook a roast or order pizzas, have your dad over, and eat and play games or watch a movie together every week. Then come September, we can talk about the logistics of moving our family together if that\u2019s something that you still want to do.\u201c\n\nAnd maybe if that time comes, you should sell FIL\u2019s house and use it to ad an addition with an apartment, or tiny home in your backyard, so FIL can be close by but you still have your own space?", "NTA. Your kids come first and sharing a bedroom well into their teens/until they move out seems a problem for all involved. If you are rural, do you have the land space for a tiny home? Would be cheaper than an apt for the dad, he would be a stones throw away, and you wouldn\u2019t need to kick anyone out of their rooms, and would be only a value add to your property. Something prebuilt with a ground floor bedroom and a bathroom.", "NAH.  I am in my 40s and my mom died last year, so I am kind of in a similar place as your husband.

I anticipate they will be for a while.\n\nI completely understand your husband's desire to do something to help his dad - that is natural and commendable. He also may be feeling vulnerable and looking to hold onto what he has left - and wanting to move his dad into the house could be part of that.\n\nI am also 100% with you about not making any major decisions until you all are farther along in your grieving process.  Taking a step back and letting some time go by is important - because what may seem totally reasonable while you are in the depths of your grieving may not seem reasonable at all later on.  Heck, I thought it would be best for us to move into my mom's house after she died and live there.  No, that wasn't a good idea, I was just trying to hang onto the past that I wasn't ready to let go of yet.  I see that now.  There are still days that I wish I lived in that house and am incredibly sad that I don't - but that's the grief.\n\nYou said your husband has started counseling - this may be something that the counselor can help with - help him see that his motivation is likely driven by grief rather than what makes the most sense for your family, dad included.\n\nEdited to add - I think that not wanting to have 2 grieving men in your house is completely valid and not at all selfish.  That would be a lot to deal with.  I know what my grief process has looked like and sometimes I don't even want to deal with myself.  I certainly wouldn't want to deal with two of me.  And not to put too much stock in gender stereotypes, but as women, we tend to be much better at dealing with emotions and soldiering on than men are.

The room was renovated and furnished for that child. Taking it away basically as soon as they get it (especially with less than 6 months-a year living in that room) will bring resentment. Having grandparents around is great, but OP is not wrong for thinking of her children first. Having a grandparent around does not mean they have to move in. FIL could move someplace down the road.

If he doesn\u2019t want to move in but wants to be close, finding a house or retirement home closer is the best option. OP said no to FIL moving in and displacing their second child who just got their first taste of independence (own room) which if displaced from, can cause resentment. \n\nOP\u2019s answer was not only no. OP also mentioned the other options: FIL moving closer but into a condo or retirement home so he is closer that way everyone would have their own space and husband said no because FIL would still be alone. But husband isn\u2019t thinking, because FIL wouldn\u2019t be alone in a retirement home. Husband is thinking about his grief, not what is logical and rational. I understand why husband is doing that, but many grief counselors state you cannot make such rash and/or big life decisions so soon to a life changing event (like a family death). \n\nHow does inheritance have anything to do with the discussion at hand? OP said no to moving him in because it will displace everyone and is probably not what everyone wants, maybe just the husband. We don\u2019t know what FIL wants.

Op is saying the situations are 100% different, not a bit different. Also she put in her post in a way that can be perceived as complaining about him not being attentive enough and not being present enough so at the very least she already has an issue with him not being very attentive but if he was to do what she did and leave to be with his father for 3 weeks seems to me that it would turn into I had to do everything while he was gone", "True I see what you mean...yes it's harsh to say but I do understand how OP feels.

In this case it's easy to point fingers and say how she should be there for her husband and while there are ways to be there for support, having one child is a demanding task, having three kids is an extreme, two person job. I can see how she wouldn't have the mental space, time, or energy to even see how she could do LIFE with not just one but two grieving adults and three children shoved into one room. \n\nI do disagree about the way the husband went about it though. Regardless, there was a huge life changing event that happened. Right after that we are talking about another life changing event (bringing his father into their home) and that should've been discussed with her from the beginning/when he first started thinking about it. \n\nIt's a tough situation all around.

It\u2019s stunning how many people seem to be wildly underestimating the impact this will have on you and your children\u2019s lives. Even if his father\u2019s heath magically fails to deteriorate, having him in your household is still going to entail a lot more work and adjusting on your and the kids\u2019 parts. The emotional labor you will have to provide is staggering: on top of having to fill the gaps your husbands grief is creating in the household, you\u2019ll be expected to manage the kids\u2019 upset at having their living situation changed (and the behavioral problems and long conversations that go with it), your husband\u2019s feelings on it all, and now also tending to grandpa\u2019s feelings on losing his independence\u2014 on top of managing your own feelings, needs, and wants, if you have time, of course. Self care will be next to impossible and you seem already tapped out. We haven\u2019t even touched on what adding another person to the household will do to the housework you have to do. For a lot of women, having an able bodied in-law move in with them even under good circumstances is still the difference between holding things together most days to habitually crying in the bathroom whenever you can justify a moment alone. A lot of little, hard to pinpoint things will change with this, and goddamn does it add up. \n\nThis is not a small sacrifice. Do not let your husband hand wave the emotional and domestic labor this will require of you. He will not be present for most of that work, so it\u2019s natural for him to undervalue what this will cost. Yes, it\u2019s possible that it will all work out just fine and grandpa will be an utter joy that helps everyone heal, but that\u2019s a rosy perspective usually offered by those who have the luxury of not being full time, involuntary caretakers in the first place. \n\nYour husband has a deeply valid reason to consider and present the idea. Parents dying and growing old is a whole new ball game in terms of anxiety and existential fear. It does not mean that this plan somehow doesnt still entail lighting your and your children\u2019s needs on fire to keep someone else warm. It likely will NOT be a temporary arrangement. There are many factors to consider, many of which your husband (understandably) has not fully weighed with his grief pressing down on him with that urgent fear. However, his grief does not give him license to deem the sacrifices you and your kids will have to make as less important than his dad\u2019s suffering, nor your defense of them as selfish. If the difference between this plan either working or failing is \u201cOP needs to change her feelings\u201d, it\u2019s doomed to fail anyway. \n\nYou need to discuss this with him in full, possibly with a mediator, before anyone makes any decisions or offers. Please, please, please focus on addressing your husband\u2019s many assumptions, the main one being how much of your time and labor he is theoretically speaking for. I\u2019m sure in his mind he sees this as a team effort and fully intends to contribute a fair share, but if he works full time and you don\u2019t, it *will* fall on you eighty percent of the time unless you dig in your heels and refuse to do more than half (which you won\u2019t be able to do in reality, because everyone will be grieving and your husband legitimately busy and it will always be \u201cwhy can\u2019t you do just this one more little thing?\u201d). Who will spend most of the day with his father should he move in? What care will he need? How exactly will this alter the children\u2019s routines? What does he expect the division of household labor to be? Does your husband actually know how much time you spend on taking care of the household as it is? How much free time to mentally and physically recover you currently get? What will have to be cut in order to provide even a minimum standard of care for his father?\n\nIt really sucks, but your husband is grieving and trying to do a good thing for him and his father without having to confront and accept what a shitty thing it is to do to you and the kids.

Insert your boundaries on the plan and you will take such a weight off your husbands shoulders. He\u2019ll soften towards you.

That's the crux of the matter. If she accepts this decision now, it's most likely a permanent obligation until the FIL dies. She'll have to lift him, change his bed pan, keep track of his medication, give him sponge baths, take him to the bathroom, wipe his ass, become his therapist, and the list goes on and on (and all of that without any training and without the possibility of quitting).\n\nIt's a huge ask for someone who was never raised by that man, and who never planned on becoming a caretaker, an orderly, or a nurse.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd yes, the husband is going to ask for her reasons and then he's going to call her selfish. That's going to happen.\n\nFor that, I recommend that she reads the book \"When I Say No, I feel Guilty\" by Manuel J. Smith. The OP needs to read that book. And if she doesn't believe me, at the very least, she needs to read the customer reviews of that book on Amazon (I would share the link, but I don't want to risk getting this post deleted).\n\nBut basically, when he calls her selfish, she needs to learn not to defend herself on that point. The more she tries to control what he says/thinks about her, the more he will be controlling her. That's how manipulation works. It's a two-way control. And the more she tries to defend herself, explain herself, and justify herself, the more control she will give him over her own decisions.\n\nAlso, she'll need to use a broken record (not in an childish way). But basically, she needs to be crystal clear about what she's going to say and roughly repeat the same thing over and over again. Because the more consistent she is in her answer, the less likely she's to say the wrong thing, that he would use as an excuse to blow up at her. Also, he would see any variability in her answer as a possible opening to wear her down on.\n\nBasically, there is quite a bit more to the book, but I do have one more piece of advice. The book is probably easier to read if you read some of the transcripts near the end of the book first.", "Not only this, but they also say not to make drastic changes within the first year of a loss.

The middlest had to have her own room for a while, and now the oldest is sleeping in there again but they kind of rotate who hangs out in it.

Both of my aunts offered for my grandma to move in with them, and they also offered to help her move into an independent assisted living facility (basically you live alone and independently but a nurse will stop by daily to check in on you).\n\nMy grandma wanted none of it. She wanted to stay in *her home.* Yes, she had many memories of my grandpa, but that had been her home for most of her life, and she wasn\u2019t going to just up and move because my aunts thought she\u2019d be lonely. My mom and aunts set up a schedule so someone was visiting her and checking in on her every day, and when they couldn\u2019t go us older grandkids would go.\n\nHas your husband even spoken to his dad about this? Does his dad *want* to move? It feels like your husband is somehow managing to both show pity and a lack of empathy for his dad. Pity in that he thinks his grown ass father who raised him can\u2019t adult on his own anymore, and a lack of empathy in asking his dad to completely uproot his life after he just lost his wife. That is a *major* life change your husband wants to throw at him when he\u2019s already vulnerable.\n\nThat\u2019s his home. People aren\u2019t usually super keen on just leaving their own home, especially when they\u2019ve lived there for literal decades.

He\u2019ll go from familiar places and faces to a place where just going to the grocery store will be new and frustrating. He\u2019ll probably spend all his time inside and end up even more depressed.\n\nI don\u2019t know. If I lost my wife, the last thing I\u2019d want is to completely give up *nearly every single other aspect of my life.* But that\u2019s me.\n\nSit your husband down and talk to him. Figure out of this is his dad wanting to move or your husband needing his dad around because he\u2019s feeling something about losing his mom. This is one of those times when open and honest communication will likely solve this problem.\n\nFor sure, though, your husband needs therapy, ASAP.", "NAH. It's incredibly important to have a strong support system around you when you're grieving, but -- exploring other options, talking to your daughter whose room might be used, figuring out whether moving right now is something his father would even agree to, or at least having a timeframe if moving in ends up being the best option -- are all necessary for a solution that works for everyone.", "NAH - You're definitely not the A-H and you're doing a good job to keep an open mind to find a better solution than what your husband has suggested. I don't like the idea of calling your husband an A-H either, though, because his heart's in the right place. But going through such an emotional time isn't a great starting point for making big life choices & changes. Are there grief management groups somewhere near you that your husband can attend in between therapy sessions?\n\nIn any case, hold your ground on not moving your FIL in with your family, and hopefully your husband will start to come around soon.

Pay for someone to check in on him and have him for a visit instead.\nEdit NTA", "NTA-- A few years ago my own FIL got ill and was hospitalized. During that time, and honestly the time leading up to it, we knew that he shouldn't be living alone. When he was released from the hospital, I convinced my partner that we should move him in with us. It seemed like a great idea because they could spend time together and grow their relationship and we could monitor his health. I had anticipated that he would live with us the rest of his life and was excited about the opportunity to grow our family with him present.\n\nIT. WENT. TERRIBLY. \n\nMy FIL had absolutely no desire to live with us and made that super clear almost immediately. He either expected to be catered to (meals served on trays in his room because he did not want to eat with us) or he wanted to be left alone (we took him on a cabin fishing trip, something my partner said they used to love to do together, and he wouldn't even leave the cabin). After 9 months of this, we ended up moving him into assisted living where he could have his own space and that seems to have worked out better. Unfortunately those 9 months really caused a rift in the relationship between my partner and his father-- he had expectations of this grandiose relationship with his dad living with us that just didn't come to fruition. \n\nI fear that your husband may be in the same mindset that I was, fantasy land, and is not seeing the big picture. He wants to do something nice for his dad, and most likely remembers him the way he used to be. His dad is older now, and it doesn't sound like you visit all that often, so its possible his dad is vastly different than how he remembers him as a kid. Moving his dad in is going to cause stress to your family, and it doesn't sound like your middle child is going to be super happy with the circumstances. This, to me, is a recipe for disaster. We don't even know if his dad WANTS to move in.", "NTA - getting a tiny home on your property might be the best solution.

Major decisions after a significant loss like this should wait at least a year. The decision should wait until he has had time to grieve and feels ready to make that decision. It should not be rushed. If FIL is struggling, your H and he need to remember that grief has its own timeline. Supports are available to help him process. \n\nHusband isn't being selfish either, but he's making these plans from a place of grief and wanting to help his dad. He's not thinking through the long term impact on all of you. A really important issue to consider is: as dad's health fails, who will end up taking on all the labor required to care for him?

He is dropping the ball and you cant cope with 3 children and him let alone adding another person into the mix.

Moving him into our home long term/permanently is a massive change for him, you, and our entire family. Its not a decision that should be made in haste while the grief is acute. (Again, I think experts would agree with this--it's not just you pulling reasons out of thin air.)\n\n2)  Seeing you deal with his grief in addition to your own has been hard on you, me, and the kids. It is understandably affecting your ability to be present with me and the kids. I worry that bringing your dad into our home will only exacerbate this as transitioning your dad would become a primary focus. \n\n3) I  don't want to kick our middle child out of the room that we just made specifically for them. That isn't fair to them. \n\nThose are honest and fair thoughts based on your original post. You need to be able to say those things to him. Saying them isn't selfish.

Being in a rural area, there will be longer drives and more of them.  How long is an ambulance ride to a hospital? Many of those I work with live in rural areas.  An emergency can require a helicopter ride, where you are looking at $75k + for a simple trip to the ER.\n\nAnother item to consider is social contacts.  He was married and it sounds like in the area where he lives for some time.  I am sure he and MIL had friends and acquaintances.  Is taking him away from his known friends and activities really in his best interest?\n\nI am sorry for you and your family's loss, but you need to stand strong.", "Sounds to me like the responsibility of his care would land on you.

In our culture we look after old people. Older generations looked after us when we were young so we have an obligation to look after them when they are old. I think western culture is probably the only culture where the concept of family has been eroded into the nuclear family consisting of a couple and their children. You will find that in most cultures throughout human history, the concept of family extended to other generations and even other branches of the family tree like aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. The concept of family is much bigger and honestly, I think it can work really well if everyone gets along and looks after each other.\n\nYour culture is not my culture, but I'm going to ask you to think about why your husband made the request. His father is grieving after losing his life companion. It's probably not good for him to be alone right now. He's old. Maybe he's struggling to take care of himself.\n\nIf you were from a non-white, non-western culture, I think the answer would be obvious.\n\nBut given you are (presumably) American, you probably don't feel the same sense of obligation towards extended family, which is understandable, if that's the culture that you grew up in.\n\nBut I'm going to ask you to think about what's best in this situation. Your father-in-law is your father's father, the man who raised him. He's also the grandfather of your children.\n\nHe's not a stranger. He's family.\n\nMaybe having him stay with your family even temporarily, while he recovers from his grief, might not be a bad thing. Maybe it will give your husband time to reconnect with his father, and your kids will get to spend time with their granddad.\n\nThink about it, OP. Is it a burden, or is it an opportunity?

As I would expect him to take over a bigger section of responsibilities if OP was grieving? My husband is currently basically carrying our household, in terms of chores and finances, while I\u2019m coping with my grief for my parent, so I guess I do understand how the husband might be feeling.

It's such an entitled point of view. Many, many children and teenagers around the globe never sleep in a bedroom alone, but share permanently with siblings, or at least do not have their own room until other siblings move out.

Your children will never forgive you either. \n\nDo not make any decisions straightaway. Take the time to look though and discuss all options. Discuss everyone roles and include the children. They do count because they are part of the household. Could you build an extension to your house for him using his money or something in the back garden?

OP, it sounds like your husband has left you doing all the emotional labor, and possibly physical labor, of the household. That\u2019s not fair. If his dad move in, you\u2019ll likely be the caregiver for him as well as your three children. That is a very big ask. There is a difference between selfishness and rational self-interest. Selfishness, to me, is having an abundance of resources and refusing to share. Rational self-interest is that part of you that says, \u201cI\u2019m tapped out, I can\u2019t give any more.\u201d It\u2019s your sense of exhaustion and general malaise because you aren\u2019t getting what you NEED because other people\u2019s needs are taking up most, or all, of your resources. This is especially true if you are stuck with the role of asking for help if you need it. No one is taking care of your needs or even paying attention to them\u2014you have to ask for what you need. So, if you are in that place, and I think you might be, or course you don\u2019t want to take on a fifth responsibility.

My suggestion is to try and set up an appointment for the two of you with his therapist so you can explain you very valid reasons in a controlled environment with the help of the therapist. Maybe they can help him understand your reasons. I get it, my grandfather asked me and my ex-wife to move in after my grandmother died. My ex- wife has to deal with my grief and my grandfather\u2019s grief. I was still present when people were around and at work but I would check out every time I got the chance. My grandmother will be gone 10 years this year and while it got better it never really goes away. A retirement village sound like a acceptable solution. Many older people thrive around people their own age. He will be able to make friends and be social. If you move him in with you, the only social interaction he will have is with your family. I have seen so many older people who get lost in their grief and then as bad as this sounds but die. Moving him to your house will cause so many things. Resentment from two of your children, resentment towards your husband and FIL from me and could ultimately end your marriage if you let it.", "Gonna go with YTA not because you don't want FIL to live with you, but because you're not communicating honestly, and you're doing it because you think it would make you look bad. If honest communication damages your position, your position deserves more scrutiny.", "I\u2019m surprised everyone is saying NTA. In most of the world multigenerational homes are common and celebrated, elders are cared for after all their years of caring for us. I totally understand not wanting your teen kids to have to share a room again, but you didn\u2019t seem interested in finding a compromise\u2014with the earnings from his house you could add a trailer or tiny home to your property, expand your home to include a suite for him, or help him move to his own place in your town.

Ask yourself how overwhelming it would be if your relationship with your husband changed forever because he resented you or felt abandoned by you.\n\nYour children are old enough to understand that grandma passed away and now grandpa needs our help and support. Maybe the tiny home someone else suggested could be an option for the separate rooms you'd like for your youngest children and in 4 years you have a child going off to college. 4 years is a long time but again your family needs your support.\n\nAsk your husband if he thinks he and his father can lean on each other and maybe that will hasten their time through the grief. Maybe your husband wants his father closer so he doesn't feel like he will lose another parent especially because he watched it happen to your parents. He's in pain and you're telling him you can't help him. That only hurts more. How much longer will you continue to deal with the grieving husband you can't handle if he has more pain on his plate?", "NTA \n\nThe fact that the FIL has lots of money changes everything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he could not afford a home anymore then taking him in temporarily would be the kind thing to do but he has the money to afford a place in a care home or assisted living if neccessary. Your husband is griefing and likely doesn't wanna feel the guilt of \"abandoning his dad\" in this time of sorrow. But there is more than one way to help him. Moving him into your home isn't the only solution and if he refuses to discuss this and find an alternative that doesn't severely inconvenience his own family then I'd absolutely die on this hill if I were you. It's not fair on you and he seems to be blinded by his own grief.", "This is the answer.

You are teaching your children that the elderly are burdens to have. Just stick them in a nursing home which is what Your children would do to you when you get old.
