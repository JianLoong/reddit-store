She was in the hospital in the psych ward for a few days in quarantine when she was apparently diagnosed with agoraphobia.\n\n However she had gone to an *ANIME CONVENTION* the previous day. I told her that yes she can go outside, she did it yesterday. This made her very upset and she explained that it takes a lot of mental effort and preparation to leave the house (she only seems to go out every month or two) and that her makeup/nice clothes help her feel secure and confident, but going out in pyjamas with unkempt hair and no makeup is somehow different even when it's JUST the backyard. \n\n She explained that anxiety doesn't have to make sense and she knows it's illogical but can't control it, she even went off on me *screaming* that my 'lack of understanding and nonchalant attitude for her 'depression and anxiety' is why she HATES me and why we'll never have a good relationship and that she just asked me to do a simple thing for her.

Going outside, or even just past what can be a sort of \"threshold of safety\" like a back door can be completely overwhelming when you're unprepared and unmotivated to do it. Personally I have also gone to things like busy events over the years when I've been entirely prepared and ready to, but the catch with that is that usually means for another couple weeks afterwards I can't even think about fetching the post from the post box outside until I've recovered from the monumental amount of mental and physical energy it takes out of me to do something (like an anime convention), even if that was something I'd been looking forward to and enjoyed while I was there. \n\nPhobias aren't reasonable, and being forced unwillingly into confronting them by a 3rd party that isn't supportive would be almost guaranteed to cause setbacks, because you are forcing her into a situation in which her brain screams \"UNSAFE\" even if there's no logical reasoning behind it, and that sort of thing is traumatic.\n\nSo yeah, I think you're a massive asshole for being dismissive of genuine mental health issues that of course don't make sense or they wouldn't be phobias and disorders.

I feel like if this story was about a 27 year old man living with his parents, playing video games all the time and only leaving the house for anime conventions and refusing to leave the house for anything that doesn't interest him, I feel like we would all be questioning whether he's actually agoraphobic or just doesn't want to get a job. Frankly if a giant crowd filled anime convention she's fine with I'm not sure if she actually has agoraphobia. It could be she just doesn't want to get a job and just wants to stay home and watch anime or stay home and play video games all the time. What is really the difference between a deadbeat who just wants to live off their parents and watch anime, and someone with a real mental illness if the behavior is the same? Genuine question. I think since she was recently inpatient she should be still receiving outpatient intensive therapy. If not that needs to be a requirement. She needs to be making progress over the next year even if it's small. As long as she is trying her best and staying in therapy I feel like OP should cut her some slack. But if she isn't attending therapy or following all of the medical advice then I think OP shouldn't cut her any slack at all. Being mentally ill can't be helped. But you can still control your actions. Being mentally ill doesn't give you a pass to do whatever you want. It just means you have to try harder to be a functional person.

A professional would know and be able to help parents navigate the situation better, even if they don't directly to tell them the diagnosis.\n\nWhat's happening now is you have an adult, living at home, willing to go to big fun events, but unwilling to go into the back yard. Furthermore, they appear to be making no plans to move out and telling the person whose house they are living in they hate them and will always hate them. Sorry, but daughter is an adult openly disrespectful of the one willing choosing to provide for her now. OP has zero obligation to provide for an adult. There's some lines being crossed now, and asking for therapy or proof she is actively seeking treatments is justified now", "HIPAA", "Are you talking about OP\u2019s daughter or my sister?", "I understand you want an argument.

Or how *your* energy levels probably change every day? Yeah, it\u2019s like that. Stop being ableist and educate yourself.", "Oh great yeah let me just go call my medical professional. How bout we come back to reality and think about money, do you think a father with 2 daughters that have these issues can afford to do that, no the clearly better way in this situation is trial by fire.", "I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s torture, I got over my fear.", "Her dad telling her her fears are stupid and for her to just get outside. What, you never doubled down on a decision you made after your parents made you feel like shit for it, regardless whether your decision was good or bad?", "Leaving the house does that to her without mental preparation and a love of the other stimuli. YTA. You aren\u2019t her psych.", "Those same lines didn\u2019t need to be crossed by the dad openly accusing her of lying.

OP is having to pick up the slack for her bad days. You never have a right to let your disorder affect other people without making good faith efforts to mitigate. \n\nPointing out daughter was still disrespectful of OP is not ableist. If she was a minor, it'd be a different story. Parents do have a responsibility towards minors, but they also have more ability to get help. But OP is currently choosing to care for her. Don't bite the hand that feeds in this case. Daughter would have been fine if she had gotten upset, but she escalated, too. OP has a right to get upset at that- he doesn't have to let her live there to begin with. \n\nAnd I am in favor of family therapy overall, but if she doesn't want any questions or people pointing out when her behavior is irrational, she may want to seek other housing.
