So one day, she can barely leave the house and go shopping, while other days, she can go to get-togethers without any problems. Your daughter has planned the con for a while and was able to go there through proper planning. After that, she might feel exhausted, after all, it was a lot to take in, especially with anxiety.

Since this was something diagnosed in a psych ward at a hospital, I imagine it is probably severe. I do think there is a difference going to an anime convention as like she explained she had a lot of mental preparation for it and apparently has some coping mechanisms to help make it easier (leaving with nice clothes and makeup). It's easy for someone without such a disorder to go 'Omg, daughter, it's just the backyard. No one is going to care. Just hang it up yourself' and not fully understand the mental gymnastics anxiety makes people do.   \n\n\nFrom her reaction I'd guess this isn't the first time you were dismissive of her anxiety, and your 'I personally feel she uses this as an excuse to get out of activities that don't interest her' line. God, just imagine the progress she could make overcoming her anxiety if you supported her. Instead of being like 'You do it' you could have turned it into a 'Well, how about we plan a day where we both go up and hang it.

I've made some progress, but I'm still considered disabled when you take into account other mental illnesses I have.\n\nIm going to talk about my personal experience for a moment. Going outside, or even just past what can be a sort of \"threshold of safety\" like a back door can be completely overwhelming when you're unprepared and unmotivated to do it. Personally I have also gone to things like busy events over the years when I've been entirely prepared and ready to, but the catch with that is that usually means for another couple weeks afterwards I can't even think about fetching the post from the post box outside until I've recovered from the monumental amount of mental and physical energy it takes out of me to do something (like an anime convention), even if that was something I'd been looking forward to and enjoyed while I was there. \n\nPhobias aren't reasonable, and being forced unwillingly into confronting them by a 3rd party that isn't supportive would be almost guaranteed to cause setbacks, because you are forcing her into a situation in which her brain screams \"UNSAFE\" even if there's no logical reasoning behind it, and that sort of thing is traumatic.\n\nSo yeah, I think you're a massive asshole for being dismissive of genuine mental health issues that of course don't make sense or they wouldn't be phobias and disorders.

I feel like if this story was about a 27 year old man living with his parents, playing video games all the time and only leaving the house for anime conventions and refusing to leave the house for anything that doesn't interest him, I feel like we would all be questioning whether he's actually agoraphobic or just doesn't want to get a job. Frankly if a giant crowd filled anime convention she's fine with I'm not sure if she actually has agoraphobia. It could be she just doesn't want to get a job and just wants to stay home and watch anime or stay home and play video games all the time. What is really the difference between a deadbeat who just wants to live off their parents and watch anime, and someone with a real mental illness if the behavior is the same? Genuine question. I think since she was recently inpatient she should be still receiving outpatient intensive therapy. If not that needs to be a requirement. She needs to be making progress over the next year even if it's small. As long as she is trying her best and staying in therapy I feel like OP should cut her some slack. But if she isn't attending therapy or following all of the medical advice then I think OP shouldn't cut her any slack at all. Being mentally ill can't be helped. But you can still control your actions. Being mentally ill doesn't give you a pass to do whatever you want. It just means you have to try harder to be a functional person. Because you still have a responsibility to manage your own mental health and receive treatment to get better so you aren't a burden on those around you.

For me at least it's like everything resets even if the exposure should have reassured me against my anxieties.

Sure, certain clothes and stuff can be comforting/act as a coping mechanism and can help with that, but it seems odd that the first time she leaves the house post-psych stay is to go to *comic con* (out of her house, *massive* crowds, and its difficult to get help easily if something goes wrong) but she can\u2019t put up a bird feeder. And i\u2019m not saying she\u2019s 100% lying, but i can recognise why OP is confused and/or frustrated, and the dynamic here- where the parents do everything to cater to this and the daughter only uses coping mechanisms when she wants to go to something, and doesnt seek treatment- is odd and OP\u2019s not beingn unreasonable to dislike it.\n\nLike, I dont *have* agoraphobia, but i\u2019ve been in situations where my depression/anxiety have dipped enough to *cause* that kind of intense anxiety around leaving the house, and it really does suck.
