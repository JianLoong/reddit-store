When they first separated it was because my mom had changed a lot and was undiagnosed with brain cancer at the time which had caused a lot of behavioral changes. I still remember how big those changes were. The diagnosis came just before she died. While my parents were separated dad met Rebecca and they got married 3 months after mom died. They had pushed the wedding up since they were no longer waiting for the divorce.\n\nRebecca has always had a very negative perception of mom because dad has told her about her behavior before they separated. She said our mom was a bad parent and she would make sure we know what a good mom looks like. From almost the beginning of their marriage she has called herself our mom. Years later I found out she knew back when she married my dad that she couldn't have kids of her own.\n\nMy sister and I have never liked Rebecca because of the stuff she says about mom. Dad knows how we feel and after he did some therapy, he would tell her to stop. But he also told us that we should understand that Rebecca loves us and feels like we deserve the best and she might say the wrong thing because of that sometimes.\n\nWith all that out of the way I can explain the problem. I have a pretty big friend group. Six of the moms of my friends have made their own little mom group where they can get together and vent and hang out. I think sometimes they use it to plan who'll host something or will volunteer to chaperone some things. The moms in the group all know my sister and I do not consider Rebecca our mom and that we dislike her. My sister is also part of the friend group so they know her feelings too. Rebecca wanted to join the group so many times over the years and was always kept out.\n\nThen a month ago Rebecca actually approached the moms when she saw them out for coffee together and asked why she was never welcomed in. They told her she was not a mom and so they weren't going to include her. She argued back that she's mine and my sister's mom. They said we say differently and that our opinion matters more. They also told her that they were never going to make things uncomfortable for the kids by including her since it would mean she would be around the friend group for certain group stuff we've done together.\n\nRebecca vented over dinner to us about it and I shrugged her off when she asked what I had to say. The truth is I don't feel the tiniest bit bad that she's been excluded. But she was pissed and dad told me I should be kinder.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693482259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1668ve7/aita_for_shrugging_off_my_dads_wife_being/", "score": 1356, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While the circumstances are different, as your parent\u2019s marriage deteriorated before her cancer was diagnosed, I can understand how those changes can cause strain on relationships. It wasn\u2019t your mom\u2019s fault. \n\nNow, on to your actual question. You and your sister don\u2019t control what those other adults said to your stepmom. You told them that you didn\u2019t have a relationship with her because she badmouthed your late mother and don\u2019t consider her your mother, because she\u2019s not. It was up to them (as grown adults) to filter through that information and glean from it what they want. They decided that she wasn\u2019t worth the hassle to them and that\u2019s on them. Not your problem.", "NTA. Dude, your friends' moms are awesome. Good on them for looking out for you two", "I will start by saying NTA.  \n\nI will be down voted but be will be the devils advocate.  I am sorry for losing your mother but you said her behavior changed from a brain tumor.  Well in what way.  How long was she different.  Also you were 7, I am sure your father saw something much different and that he confided in Rebecca.  Also what things does she say about your mother, are they the truth or does she lie and go on a rant.  Has she continued after therapy or has she stopped.  Has Rebecca been there for you and your sister in every other way or she just ignore you.  \n\nI know these are a lot of questions but to be honest, it is easy to paint the picture of someone being evil, but you only brought up one aspect of this.  I know it sounds like your dad moved on quickly, but again given your age, your parents could have been checked out for awhile before your father married Rebecca.  Again I am not pointing fingers, just trying to give a different side.  It almost sounds like you resent the fact that she wanted to be a mother figure to both of you after your loss.  She might have come on too strong.  I do hope only the best for you.", "The problem she knows she would not have her husband without brain cancer. She knows if just one thing played out differently she might not have her husband. \n\nShe did not want to see your mother as a woman ravaged by a disease that destroyed her physically and emotionally as well as wreaking havoc on everyone in her beautiful family. \n\nYou father\u2019s wife didn\u2019t help you cope. She wanted to erase and reframe.  She could have been a friend. She could have been a confidant. She could have been a mother figure. But she wanted to rewrite the end of your mother\u2019s time on earth (as a \u201cbad mom\u201d) to suit her dreams of motherhood by inserting her self in a role that was never hers to begin with. Her insecurities are not your burden to bear. \n\nAll of the nope to that. You are NTA.", "I am only a maternal figure in my stepson\u2019s life as long as HE feels that way. If that ever changed, then I\u2019m no longer a maternal figure. Simple as that. NTA.", "Could this be be more about how she feels about her marriage? \nYour dad unknowingly abandoned your mum in her time of need. In sickness and in health.  Not saying he is to blame especially as they didn't know why her behaviour became so extreme but it must weigh heavily on him in hindsight and maybe she is jealous of that.", "Rebecca needs to get in lane.\n\nBad-mouthing your mother was never a good plan to get along with you.\n\nNTA.", "Info:  you have a lot in here about how much you hate Rebecca but you don\u2019t seem to acknowledge if you have ever had her act like a mom to you in the almost 10 years you have known her.  \n\nI think a lot of people are getting bogged down on her behavior which I\u2019m not saying is correct (and I hold your dad responsible for not shutting it down at all).  \n\nIf you really feel that Rebecca is not your mom be sure that you and your sister aren\u2019t getting the step parent treatment from her and are in fact getting the Dads Wife treatment.  No rides, no lunches, no chit chat after school, no money, no help with homework, no gifts on holidays or birthdays.  Nothing.", "NTA, her big mistake was speaking ill of your mother.  If your mothers actions were off it wasn't because she was a bad mother.  It was because of her illness.  And the fact that she tries to say your mom, who passed away, wasn't good to you is horrible.  Tell her if she can't keep her mouth shut about your mom then she doesn't deserve any kind of respect from you and your sister.", "NTA\n\nLove it that your friends' moms respect your feelings on this!", "It's a mess.  I watched a friend slowly deteriorate and die from brain cancer.  She went from bubbly and sweet, a really warm and loving parent and spouse and friend, to filled with rage and requiring other adult family members to live with them to prevent violence/abuse.\n\nIf this wasn't diagnosed until late and OP's dad was divorcing his wife over her changed behavior?  That suggests it was pretty bad.  Especially since he still feels the need to talk about that time with his current wife.\n\nBut kids are fiercely loyal to their parents, even if mistreated.\n\nAnd anyone competing with the dead is going to find themselves losing.  Step-mom is a real person who makes mistakes, screws up, and has to do better.  Dead mom is on a pedestal where anything she did wrong is attributed to the disease that killed her.\n\nThe only way to \"win\" this sort of competition is to never compete or compare with the dead.", "Rebecca has never apologized. Dad did but expected us to love Rebecca despite her continuing to say things about mom.", "if they are going through a divorce it isn't an affair", "Even if she does actually care for us, and not just as trying to get out of us what she can't have herself, she will never be family after talking about my mom the way she has, for all these years.", "I can't appreciate the stuff she does around the house/us because she has insulted my mom the whole time. I don't have any respect or love for her.", "I don't feel bad for her at all. I have never felt bad for her in any of this. She's a shitty person in my eyes and does not deserve to be included in a mom group centered around my friends and I.", "I mean, the step mom did it to herself. She's not hated just for being a step mom but for her actions. I wouldn't have empathy for the mess she made of her own by talking bad about their dead mom.", "Reveling in it is not being indifferent. Which is what OP is here. \n\nThis isn't a poor step mom maligned by social pressure, this is a shit person who talked badly about their dead mom. I might be on your side if this woman didn't tell little kids their mommy sucked.", "I see plenty of flaws in my dad and I know my mom had them too. But mom was not a bad mom. She was sick. She loved us and I know she was good.\n\nRebecca has overshadowed everything good she could have done by talking about mom the way she did. She made both of us hate her early and that will always be true. I will never claim her as my family. I will never be glad to have her in my life.", "Wait, this woman insults the mother they lost to cancer in some backward attempt to make them love her, and  *they're* the bad guys? Give us all a break.  She's terrible and doesn't deserve any sympathy for being a jerk to children just to polish her own apple.", "My mom had more of a temper and she would do things that were out of character for her. Mostly at herself though. She was more forgetful and stuff of that nature.\n\nShe never stopped saying those things. She still says them. Any good she might have tried to do is meaningless when she has been so shitty about mom.", "> But he also told us that we should understand that Rebecca loves us and feels like we deserve the best and she might say the wrong thing because of that sometimes.\n\nThis is your father gaslighting you into submission, if she loves you and want a relationship with you she must start by saying kind things.", "You do know that you are only in that house and being parented (however, much you are) because she can't have kids of her own. She wants mother experience but she ain't any good at being a mother. You would have had much worst experience if she could replace you.", "there's probably other stuff going of that they exile her. parent tend to be supportive so my guess is there's other stuff you don't know about, but it's not your problem, you can't force adults to socialize with her \n\nNTA", "Op is nta but these women are bizzare. \"We're only friends with moms\" is such an off putting thing to say. If they wanted to be blunt they can say that not everyone meshes naturally, and as an adult, she should already understand that. That doesn't take impressive thinking on your feet skills.\n\nI would not want to be friends with any of these people.", ">Can you read? They didn't find out what was the reason for behavioral changes till after they were separated, just not before divorce. by that time that dad probably went through a lot of abuse from her\n\nCan you read? OP never said that his mom was being abusive. OP says nothing about anyone being beaten.\n\nYou're way wrong here.\n\nRole reversal isn't the issue here either. This was a personality change caused by a fucking brain tumor.\n\nThere wasn't physical abuse.\n\nThe fact that both OP's dad and OP's step mom talked shit about a dead woman and got married right after she died proves that the two of them probably had a thing together far longer than OP probably even knows. \n\nGet your information correct before accusing someone of physical abuse.\n\nNTA. \n\nI am also very sorry that you and your sister OP, had to go through this trauma at such an age. You are caught remembering things as a child that you couldn't possibly understand, and can't possibly forget.", ">he will also tell us we should love her if she's insulting our mom.\n\nthen your father is the bigger AH.", "Exactly!", "she tsarted by saying 'you dead mom was a bad mom' to grieving kids pretty much shows how little care for others she really has, I'm guess she treats other people the same way.", "We don't know how much of that the women said versus what Rebecca heard.  \"You'll never be part of our mother's group\" or \"your stepdaughters don't consider you to be their mother\" could have easily been twisted into \"you'll never be a mother\" by a distraught mind.  We also don't know if she's approached this group many times before, if she was making a scene, etc. OP wasn't there,  and I feel like she probably didn't get an entirely accurate description of what happened from Rebecca. \n\nOP NTA, verdict is still out for the adults in your life, though.", "I'm inclined to give OP the benefit of the doubt that he got some details of their conversation wrong. Since he wasn't there and is only getting Rebecca's perspective from an angry rant, it's likely that that isn't quite how it went.\n\nIf he's right though yeah \"we're only friends with moms\" is a hella weird argument for not wanting someone around.", "So they say", ">OP says nothing about anyone being beaten.\n\nAbuse isn't just physical, you know. Emotional abuse can be just as, if not more, damaging.", "You're right, the only way to solve this is to turn the other cheek and endure these insults to their mother and fully embrace their father's wife as the better option.", "Even if the cancer wasn't the cause of her behavior, insulting someone to make yourself better is unproductive.  Insulting their mother isn't going to make everything better, per your words. \n\nYes, they started divorce proceedings before she was diagnosed, but that means that cancer was affecting her brain for months, if not years before then.  Your take is terrible. \n\nThis woman *knows* their mother had fucking cancer on her brain and it's reasonable to assume it affected her behavior.  It's reasonable to assume she understands this and still wants these girls to accept her by insulting the mother they lost.  Fucking gross, dude.", ">it does appear that she really does care a lot for you.\n\nI don't think that talking shit about their mom for 9 years non-stop to this day is caring about them.", "If an honest relaying of one's actions makes people shun you, the problem is the actions, not the relaying.", "She ignores every time we have told her we don't like it. We stopped after a few times because neither of us wanted to engage with her more than we had to.", "Brain tumors tend to be pretty slow, and some of the behavior changes that go with them can be horrific.  I'm hoping that as young as OP and her sister were when their mom died, they might have been shielded from the worst of it.", "Yes, I absolutely would forgive because I am an intelligent being capable of critical thinking. (Unlike you, it seems.) I also have compassion and empathy. (Also, something you lack.) Whatever abuse happened was a direct result of the brain tumor. It was something completely beyond the control of the person with the tumor. And like the other commenter said, depending on what the relationship was before the tumor caused behavioral changes would depend on whether or not I stayed married to that person. I can even understand that even if it was a previously great marriage, if the tumor caused severe enough abuse that the spouse wouldn't be able to stay married because of PTSD, but I still feel they are owed forgiveness since again, it was a fucking tumor and not just a behavioral/asshole thing responsible for the abuse. And they definitely deserve compassion, support, empathy, and not to be blamed and badmouthed. \n\nAlso, you're making up scenarios. No where does it mention physical abuse.", "You continually using the beating example isn't really helping your case here.", "Simply saying \"my step mom says bad things about my mom and I don't like it and I don't consider her my mother\" would not logically lead to this level of public scorn. \n\nOP is clearly saying far worse than that.", "I don't think we know enough about dad to say that from this post. People can behave in fucked up ways with things like brain tumors and stepmom could've just jumped at the opportunity while he was vulnerable to get her \"perfect family\"", "So despite the fact that the kids' bio moms are terrible, you know that it still wouldn't be nice to talk badly about them in front of the kids.  Why wouldn't Rebecca understand that too, it's pretty obvious.", "You say \"of course not\" like it's some obvious thing but can't understand why they aren't running to her with love and affection after she did thr very thing you say it's obvious not to do?", "Like, maybe saying the actual things the step-mom said?", "He shouldn't have moved up the wedding for his *children's* sake, in my opinion. I think it's fine if he had moved on but pushing up the wedding to so soon after their mom died would have been incredibly hard on them, especially since they were so young.", "Oh totally agree with that. I think the wedding date was definitely too soon!", "But OP specifically said in a comment that she wasn\u2019t abusive. Her personality changed and she was different. I can see how that strains a marriage. So stop making up stuff to make the dead mom seem like the problem. The stepmother and the dad are the problems.", "Abso-fucking-lately ALL that abuse should be forgiven. It was a symptom of a brain tumor that resulted in deatj and was completely 100% out of their control in how they behaved.", "Found the stepmom"]}
