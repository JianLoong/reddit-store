He has a now 12 year old son, Joey.\n\nI didn\u2019t live in the house with them for very long and obviously the age difference is big so Joey and I get along but we\u2019re not close at all. He\u2019s a nice kid but I don\u2019t know him super well. He\u2019s very attached to my mom though which I totally get, my mom is awesome. \n\nAfter I graduated this spring, I moved back closer to home (about 30 minutes from my mom). I was really excited to be nearby, we\u2019ve always been really close and I missed her a lot when I was at school.\n\nI wanted to have a dedicated girls day with my mom at least once or maybe twice a month now that I\u2019m home and we got to do that for a couple months but the last two times, my mom has shown up with Joey.\n\nAgain, I like the kid but we were doing stuff like getting our nails done, having lunch at new places, seeing plays\u2026. Joey changes that entirely. Last time we went to the zoo because he wanted to visit the reptile house and then got cheeseburgers. It was fine but that\u2019s not the day I planned with my mom.\n\nWe got into an argument on the phone that night and it came out that Steve has demanded that Joey be included on our days together because he felt that my time alone with my mother was her showing me favoritism. \n\nI didn\u2019t even know what to say, I\u2019ve never known my mom to be so spineless especially when it came to me. It really hurt me to say it but I told her I wasn\u2019t interested in that and if that was my only choice, I guess I would just have to see her on holidays and family gatherings.\n\nShe\u2019s been calling me and begging me to change my mind but she won\u2019t stand up to her husband about it so I\u2019ve just kept apologizing and saying I\u2019m not interested in having a kids day every month.

If she doesn't want to push back it is possible she has learned to be afraid of defying her husband.

It also sounds like he's trying to isolate your mother", "NTA.  Sorry, you've lost your mother.  She should step up on this.  Its stupid.  Alternatively, she could propose a plan compliant with Steve's schedule - You and Joey each get an exactly equal number of days with your mother/his stepmother.  If that works, your mother could live with you the first week of the year, and then live with Steve and Joey the second week of the year, repeating so each kid gets exactly 26 weeks.  To ensure pure equality, during your weeks, your mother could go in communicato with Joey and during Joey's weeks, you would reject and refrain from any communication with your mother.", "NTA.\n\nThat's weird and creepy of Steve, controlling too.  You're allowed alone and adult time with your mom, regardless of anyone else (be it a partner, siblings, etc.).  If she can't stand up to him about it, well that sucks, but stay firm on it.", "Nta. Showing favoritism lol, you\u2019re asking to see her once or twice a month and Joey lives with her", "Nta. She\u2019s with him every day.

Maybe not as often as once a month.\n\nNTA", "Nta honestly stand your ground. Tell your mom you love her but you deserve to have a day just the 2 of you.

Even if Joey were your bio sibling, parents and kids do things separately. I spend time with one of my children while Grandma babysits the other, and vice versa. It's a special time. NTA", "NTA sorry your mom is shitty.  She has made her choice very clear and you\u2019re not it.  I\u2019d go LC to save yourself from dealing with her whiney excuses.", "NTA\n\nSteve is the only AH here.  Why doesn't he have father son outings at the same time as your mother daughter days?  Makes no sense.  Parents go out all the time separately from siblings.  It's not even an odd thing.", "NTA \nYour mom should make time for you.", "There is really only one AH here and thats Steve. His unreasonable demand that Joey be a part of EVERYONES lives and activity is threatening you and your Mom's relationship. And you dont get this time back. Its perfectly fine to have a girls day. And a Guys day. And an, \"everyone get together and hang out or go to the (zoo, movies amusement park, insert whatever activity you want here) day. Steve unilaterally deciding that Joey must a part of every activity is wrong and an AH move on Steve's part. The solution is an adult discussion and the setting of reasonable parameters going forward.

She is with her stepson every single day. To take a few hours a month to see you shouldn't be a big deal. I'm so sorry.", "NTA", "So by Steve's logic, you getting 1 day a month for mother/daughter time means you're getting favoritism, but when his son lives there 24/7 and sees her daily, that's not seen as anything. If you can't have 1 day for just girls, then there's something wrong. Stay strong and stick to your boundaries. Also, if you can tell other family members to let them know in case he's going around spreading something else. Like, \"Oh, I wanted to do x with mom, but she has to bring the SS because Steve says if we do stuff alone, it's not fair to the kid and showing favoritism.\" It might help your mom see the problem.", "NTA. You are only asking for one or two days a month. I think it's very reasonable to only want to spend that time with your mom. Steve is the AH and you mom need to grow a spine.", "NTA.  Your mom is a grown woman and has free will.  She is choosing to bring your little brother to your outing to keep the peace with her husband.  Don't blame you for opting out.", "NTA, she is choosing her step-son and husband over you. But oh well, she can just see you for Holidays. I know it sucks discovering your mom is so spineless, but she is making her choice. You deserve quality time with your mom, this is true regardless of the age and gender of your siblings. And she is not willing to give it to you.", "NTA, and what a crock from her husband.  I raised three kids and did things separately with each of them, and it wasn't favoring one over the other, it was taking their differences into account and not making one child participate in something just because the other kid wanted to do it.", "NTA, not even a little bit.  I would send your mother a link to this, tell her you are really sad at her stance.  Ask her is she OK, is her husband always this controlling? Show her the thread, show her it's not normal what he is doing.  She could be spineless, she could be in a controlling relationship.  If she is spinless she needs it pointing out, if she is in a controlling relationship she might already know but the voices of strangers might help it hit home.", "Yeah, your mom needs to grow a pair. Having a girls day once or twice a month with your own daughters is not showing favoritism, especially since the kids lives with her. \n\nYou should send your mom a link to this thread. NTA.", "NTA but I'd keep open lines of communication with your mother. You say you've never thought she would be spineless, and that it was Steve's idea, and those aren't exactly green flags when together, you know?\n\nLike, there are very few options for why he'd claim favoritism, and all are less than stellar reason. From not wanting to be a parent, to wanting to isolate your mom, or wanting you out of the picture, they don't bode well.\n\nStand your ground, but keep an eye on the situation and support your mom, just in case.", "OMG.

Besides shouldn't he have 1-on-1 time with his son?  Can you buy tickets to something and say \"Mom, I have a spare ticket to this, would you like to come?\" so that Joey can't tag along?  \n\nOtherwise, I'd say stick to your guns.

I love my dad so much, but I barely know who he is anymore. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019ve decided I need to protect myself going forward and create some distance between us.

There\u2019s no promise that they\u2019ll come to terms with it, which is why acceptance is so important. There is no need for major drama, but it\u2019s 100% okay to ask for what you need from your mother, explicitly. If she\u2019s not willing to give it, then it\u2019s time to detach, accept, and hope she comes around.\n\nGood luck, OP. My dad has been married 8 years, and I am 33. Wish I would have put my foot down earlier and listened to my gut early on in their relationship. Not sure it would have changed anything, to be honest, but at least maybe he wouldn\u2019t have settled into the habit of accepting her wants and opinions as gospel. The relationship with my dad is not completely ruined, there\u2019s still hope, just like with your mom. I am trying to live my life and love from afar, as sad as it feels. I am hoping things change one day, but I\u2019m sick of being hurt over and over, simply because I want to spend time with my dad. \n\nAsk for what you need, express your love for your mom, that\u2019s all you can do. If she can\u2019t stand up to her husband, that is her problem, not yours. It\u2019s hard realizing parents can be like this, but do not sacrifice your self-respect and a relationship with your parent to appease their partner. Ask for what you want and what you need, and move on if they\u2019re not willing to give it. You are loved and wanted, and it may take some sleepless nights for your mom to realize what she needs to do to maintain a good relationship with you. Hopefully as your step brother gets older, it will be easier for her. \n\nI am so sorry you are going through this\u2026it hurts so much and there is no easy answer. Half the time I feel like an asshole because I want my dad to be happy, and he clearly loves her. I don\u2019t want drama between any of us, and I want to love her too, at least for his sake.

Maybe asking if he gets angry easily could be a way to get the conversation rolling.

She has to decide between antagonizing two people (Joey is not even a teenager) whom she lives with all the time, over antagonizing her adult daughter whom she will see for a few hours once or twice a month. Her decision is not surprising if Steve is very stubborn over it. She is just stuck between two people who can't compromise.", "NTA. Tell your mother that the real reason you can't spend time with her and Joey is because your boyfriend doesn't like you spending time with another man. Even if he is 12, he just hates your name and another man's put together in a sentence. He also doesn't trust your mom, I mean she did get pregnant at 15, so the only way he would feel comfortable with you seeing your mother is if he were there to chauffeur and chaperone a maximum of one time per season as his schedule allows. That's fair right?\n\nIf you are able to get that all out before she starts flipping out, immediately inform her that's similar to how you are feeling now. It doesn't feel good to have someone else dictate how and how much you can see your loved one. You never thought a man could interfere with this relationship. You are worried if she is safe.\n\n\nFor a less dramatic, more data driven effect, you could print out a calendar of the past four years (12 months per page, you don't need to kill many trees) and mark the days you saw your mother alone in one color, the days you saw your mom but Joey was there in a different color, and finally highlight the weeks you went without seeing your mother while she and Joey resided in the same home in a third color. You could then hand a fourth color to your mother and ask her to mark down the days she has had to and for herself to do whatever she had wanted or treat herself.", "Nta. So Joey lives with your mom and his father so he gets your mom's full attention virtually 24/7 without having to \"share her\" with you. But you getting 2 or 3 hrs of just you and mommy time once a month is showing favouritism? \nThere's definitely some favouritism going on here but it's not to your benefit. Joey is 12. He's perfectly capable of having a playdate with a friend or spending time with his own parent. But I'm betting stepdad doesn't want to do any actual parenting himself so he foists that all on your mom. Stepdad is an a h but mom is the biggest a h because she's willingly forfeiting her relationship with her own  child and ceding to stevies control to be his fulltime nanny", "Nta, I'm the youngest of 4 kids and my parents still made sure we all got alone time with them.", "Step dad is probably abusive and doesn\u2019t want mom to say anything to her daughter so he makes his son go. So that if  she does he can report back to him.  I mean what 12 year old boy what\u2019s to hang out with his step mom \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if he was little I would understand.", "Yep, OP this is the perfect response. Your mother is being manipulated, and you shouldn\u2019t accept it but leave communication open so she has a chance to see how weird it is.", "I wonder if mom ever gets time to herself *at all* to do anything fun that she likes, or is it 100% kid activities or things husband likes.   \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if this one of those \"you get plenty of 'me' time, you get to do the grocery shopping by yourself every single week\" kind of relationships.", "100% it's this.", "Joey gets 29 ordinary days with mom. OP can easily stop by moms and spend time with them in her home too. What OP is asking for is a special day. Personally I think she is asking for very little and that mom should grow a spine, but since that isn\u2019t happening then a compromise might work. \n\nI also think OP should push back a little. Show up at moms house and during dinner go \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this hole situation and am willing to try it step dads way. So Joey will be a part of every thing I do with mom. I\u2019ll be a part of everything you do with Joey. And all outings, events and family vacations means that all four of us is automatically invited. You know, so no one gets special treatment. \u201c Mom will love it. Step will hate it and show his favoritism quickly.", "Joey is sent to make sure mum doesn't say anything his father wouldn't approve of and to report back to his dad with a full account of the day.\n\nOP's stepfather is a control freak. She needs to go collect her mum for lunch one day when Joey is at school and have a proper conversation with her mum.", "59 cis male. Five years ago, I took my daughter to get her nails done. She convinced me to get a manicure. It was an enjoyable experience and a spontaneous bonding opportunity. Win-win!", "What is your grandmother's take on the situation? Do she and your mother get any time without Steve or Joey?", "I feel ya. My stepdad isn\u2019t dead, but he has seriously challenged my moms relationship w my sister and I. \n\nWe are no contact with him and he\u2019ll do anything to sabotage her spending time with us. It\u2019s very painful and I\u2019m happy she\u2019s gotten a bit of a spine and started standing up to him.", "This was what I was looking for! Next time they do anything with Joey OP should throw a huge tantrum about this clear favouritism! If Joey wanted to go to the zoo, they obviously were there before - why was OP not invited? They have family dinner? Oh no, it has to be canceled, because OP can\u2018t make it after work!\n\nBut I am petty like that\u2026", "Easy solution. She does one on one time with each of you \n\nOr the fact that you don\u2019t live in the house makes a difference - idk but it seems easy to solve", "NTA - Joey lives with your mum full time, and has a good amount of every day to spend time with her. All you're asking is to have a few hours of a day with her, for a couple of days a month.  Your mum needs to recognise the ridiculousness of your step father's request, so if it takes an ultimatum to do so then so be it.", "You should take Joey along for exclusively girlie things. Take him for pedicures, facials, tea parties, ballets, and to see chick flicks. I\u2019m guessing your controlling stepdad is the kind of toxic man that wouldn\u2019t want his son doing these things. Also in about 2-3 years Joey won\u2019t want to hang out with you ladies anyways. Your mom sounds like she might be in a bad relationship so try to give her a little grace especially if you say she is awesome.", "NTA it would be one thing to have the kid around if the plans for the day won\u2019t change. But now you are not allowed to do anything that was in original arrangements. Either mom goes to the nail salon with you or it\u2019s no go. Kid can come if he wants", "NTA tell your stepdad, that joey gets now more alown time with your mom, as this is clearly favoritism. To assure that your stepdad and his son need to move out immediately.", "If she's still insistent on taking the child with both of you then don't change your plans to suit him. Take him to the spa. Take him to see a show or get a manicure.  No reason it has to always become kiddie-adventure-day.\n\n\nNTA.", "There are so many posts like this in this sub and I still cannot figure out why so many people assume that the way to make this work is to ruin everyone's time. Like, why not just go with your mom and then your mom can take Joey out 1 on 1 so that he also has that bonding time? Sheesh, my wife is one of 10 siblings. Her father had off only Sundays from work and each week took a different kid for something to do on Sunday afternoon. Everyone else did whatever they planned with siblings or friends. \n\nOP and Joey are supposedly competing for individual attention, so the answer is for neither to get any individual attention? How does this make sense to anyone", "NTA.  \n\nI think you've correctly identified your mom as the problem. Steve, who sounds like a controlling AH, is not actually the problem. If your mom decides Steve's demands are more important than spending quality time with you, there may not be anything you can do other than set boundaries and move on. Maybe in a few years you can spend one on one time with your mom. When Joey is in high school, he may no longer want to go on outings with you and your mom.", "NTA\n\nBut I feel like you need to find out why your mom can\u2019t just tell her husband that it\u2019s a girl\u2019s day.", "NTA though i can't relate spending one on one time with your mum is important for you. you stepdad can go f himself if he can't respect your wishes of spending 'ONE' day alone with your mum.\n\nkeep in contact with your mum but don't allow your stepdad or stepbrother to win", "NTA, my brothers are my biological brothers and I still have girls only days with my mom. It's not favoritism at all, it's just a healthy mother-daughter relationship.\n\nAnd as other commenters have said: Joey gets her to himself every other day. Your stepdad sucks for doing this. Maybe you can talk to him about this?", "NTA\n\nYou're right, you're mum is being spineless and it's completely disrespectful and hurtful to you. Also, your mum seeing you exclusively once or twice a month is favouritism? Yea, no it's not. Sounds like step-daddy dearest is trying and succeeding in driving a wedge between your mum and you. \n\nStand strong in your decision, OP. This isn't something you should have to compromise on because your mum is too spineless to put you first a couple of times a month.", "12 yo can stay at home alone for a few hours. Your mom and Steve are assholes. Why she let him control how she spends time with her adult daughter? This is insane. NTA", "NTA. He's getting more time with your mother rn, YOUR mother's time. The stepdad is a huge AH, he's doing this on purpose. Keep your foot down, I'm sure your mother will realize what's more important soon enough, hopefully.", "Steve is a prick. It\u2019s not favoritism and he just wants her to take the kid off his hands so he can use those days for himself, obviously. No logical person would have a problem with a girls day.", "I'm so sorry to hear this. I don't think you are the ah. I think this is a very difficult situation and understandably you feel like you are missing out on something.\n\nI can imagine that the step dad insists on your step brother being there because he has deep fears that your mom has a preference and doesn't want his son to feel excluded. Saying that it would be most likely that you are missing out on stuff that you arent forcing yourself in places.\n\nMy advice is to contact your mum in a compassionate way. Saying you love her and you accept her family, however you need girly days. But you appreciate that joey wants to feel included in the family too, and would like to include him and step dad. Maybe there's things we can do together and things we can do just daughter and mum days.\n\nI find Chat gpt helps you write things in a loving and assertive way even when all you can write is aggressiveness.", "Google the word \u201cjoke.\u201d", "Yeah, but if you plan a special day with one kid for no particular reason, planning one with the other one is pretty typical. If it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday or similar then kids usually understand that they\u2019ll get their turn on their birthday, though.", "Funny how the majority offenders are men but pop culture has made women out to be the evil when it comes to step-parents, mostly.", "Steve is the asshole bid time. Your mother will have to learn to stand up for herself if she wants to see you. NTA", "NTA joey is living with your mom, is that your mom showing favouritism to him? She needs to grow a spin or accept that you won\u2019t be around much anymore.", "Have you asked your mom why she isn't willing to stand up for your relationship?\n\nOne on one time with parents is important.\nEven with blood siblings.", "NTA. F*ck your stepdad. Joey gets to see your mom everyday. Of course you two can hangout but you deserve some time alone with your mom.", "NTA at all, but it's worrying of her husband to be like this. Joey gets to have alone time with his Mum when she 'has him' (I am guessing there is one) so OP should absolutely be able to see her Mum alone. It's so manipulative of her husband to do this", "NTA.\nYou get 1 or 2 days in a month alone time with your mom. Joey has her every day. This isn't about favoritism. This seems more like he doesn't want to be the one looking after his own son during those days. Maybe he wants days off, too, and is using an excuse to put your mom in guilt.\nEither way, your mom needs to be more stern with her hubby. You are her daughter, and you need your time too with her. Maybe show your mom the responses here.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA But I would be supportive and open to your mum.  It sounds like she was so desperate to be in a relationship that she has decided to put up with manipulation and control.  I think you need to see her to know what else is going on.", "NTA. It's super weird that step-dad thinks giving each kid independent quality time is bad...it's actually necessary.", "NTA. Invite stepbro and mum to a spa day, I mean the works but dont tell them before hand, just take them there and  when he complains, say  You dad knew  this was girls day, yet he wanted you to come, complain to him. And if he doesnt complain make sure he comes home with black nailpolish.", "NTA, of course you want one on one time with mom. Don\u2019t let stepdad pressure her into always taking the little one.", "One of the hardest parts of getting older is people will come and go. And yes I include family. But it\u2019s inevitable", "NTA.  Where is Joey's mom that he gets all day, every day with yours and that's NOT \"showing favoritism\".  Your mom's husband sounds like an ass, and a control freak.\n\nYour mom needs to find a backbone.  The fact she sees nothing wrong with badgering you to take a kid along on time you plan to spend with her doesn't paint her as a good parent, or a good woman.\n\nYou can miss your mom, and I understand why you do but you also deserve to have a life that is not totally towd to a control freak and his kid.", "Here's the thing. Even if Steve is saying that Joey feels left out, how about she lets him come along once or twice, but **don't compromise for him.** Tell him, if he wants to come along he can, but he can sit there while you two get your nails done, eat what you want to eat, and sit in plays with you guys. I guarantee you his desire to. be included will drop very quickly. NTA btw.", "NTA - However do remember that Joey is 12. He probably doesn't understand why he doesn't have a day alone with his dad, or his stepmom for that matter.\n\nEveryone in the comments pointed out how he sees her at *home* every day. But do they ever do anything fun? Just the two of them?", "NAH. I get that you want to spend time with your mom. That\u2019s totally normal and fine, but it\u2019s also normal for Joey to want to be included and for your mom and step dad to encourage a relationship between the two of you. \n\nCan you ask your mom to have one dedicated day a month that\u2019s just for the two of you and one where Joey can come along? \n\nYour main argument is that he\u2019s a nice kid but you don\u2019t know him very well.. but the only way to fix that is to spend more time with him.", "NTA. Where\u2019s Joey\u2019s mother in all this? If she\u2019s still in the picture and does a good job at parenting, I\u2019d say that he already has a mother and, while of course he\u2019s going to spend time with yours, it\u2019s not favouritism for your mother to want to spend time alone with her daughter. And, even if he doesn\u2019t have his mother anymore, still 1-2 days with you alone, doesn\u2019t compare with the remaining days your mother spends with Joey.", "NTA but your stepdad and mom are. Keep advocating for yourself because your mom clearly won't. Your stepdad doesn't get to dictate your how you spend time with your mom. That disturbing and you have every right to opt out if that situation. Stepdad is alienating you from your mom and she is allowing that to happen. You deserve better OP, I'm sorry.", "No possibility at all that mom is just an asshole?", "I suspect keeping tabs, and using Joey as a spy to report back any conversation or actions.
