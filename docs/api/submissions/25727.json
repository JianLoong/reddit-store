He has a now 12 year old son, Joey.\n\nI didn\u2019t live in the house with them for very long and obviously the age difference is big so Joey and I get along but we\u2019re not close at all. He\u2019s a nice kid but I don\u2019t know him super well. He\u2019s very attached to my mom though which I totally get, my mom is awesome. \n\nAfter I graduated this spring, I moved back closer to home (about 30 minutes from my mom). I was really excited to be nearby, we\u2019ve always been really close and I missed her a lot when I was at school.\n\nI wanted to have a dedicated girls day with my mom at least once or maybe twice a month now that I\u2019m home and we got to do that for a couple months but the last two times, my mom has shown up with Joey.\n\nAgain, I like the kid but we were doing stuff like getting our nails done, having lunch at new places, seeing plays\u2026. Joey changes that entirely. Last time we went to the zoo because he wanted to visit the reptile house and then got cheeseburgers. It was fine but that\u2019s not the day I planned with my mom.\n\nWe got into an argument on the phone that night and it came out that Steve has demanded that Joey be included on our days together because he felt that my time alone with my mother was her showing me favoritism. \n\nI didn\u2019t even know what to say, I\u2019ve never known my mom to be so spineless especially when it came to me. It really hurt me to say it but I told her I wasn\u2019t interested in that and if that was my only choice, I guess I would just have to see her on holidays and family gatherings.\n\nShe\u2019s been calling me and begging me to change my mind but she won\u2019t stand up to her husband about it so I\u2019ve just kept apologizing and saying I\u2019m not interested in having a kids day every month.

If she doesn't want to push back it is possible she has learned to be afraid of defying her husband.

Hold firm she needs to be pushed to stand up to him.

Your mom's husband is an AH.", "NTA Not to be obvious, why can't your mother plan a separate activity with her stepson?

It also sounds like he's trying to isolate your mother", "NTA.  Sorry, you've lost your mother.  She should step up on this.  Its stupid.  Alternatively, she could propose a plan compliant with Steve's schedule - You and Joey each get an exactly equal number of days with your mother/his stepmother.  If that works, your mother could live with you the first week of the year, and then live with Steve and Joey the second week of the year, repeating so each kid gets exactly 26 weeks.  To ensure pure equality, during your weeks, your mother could go in communicato with Joey and during Joey's weeks, you would reject and refrain from any communication with your mother.", "NTA.\n\nThat's weird and creepy of Steve, controlling too.  You're allowed alone and adult time with your mom, regardless of anyone else (be it a partner, siblings, etc.).  If she can't stand up to him about it, well that sucks, but stay firm on it.", "Nta. Showing favoritism lol, you\u2019re asking to see her once or twice a month and Joey lives with her", "Nta. She\u2019s with him every day.

My guess is that Steve doesn\u2019t want to watch his son alone.", "Steve is the AH here.\n\nJoey is not your sibling, or biologically your mom's child.

Maybe not as often as once a month.\n\nNTA", "Nta honestly stand your ground. Tell your mom you love her but you deserve to have a day just the 2 of you. If she can\u2019t/won\u2019t stand up to her husband then she is the one not fighting to spend time with you.\n\nYou want a girls day not a day spent babysitting. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about favorites, because honestly parent spend one day a month with each bio kid they have, this is about the husband being too lazy to parent his kid.\n\nIf your mom isn\u2019t willing to go out with you just you and prioritize her new husband and step child that\u2019s on her.not you.\n\nYour doing nothing wrong with sitting this boundary.", "NtA \n\nJust bring him to the spa and get his fingernails done also.", "This doesn't sit right. Even if Joey were your bio sibling, parents and kids do things separately. I spend time with one of my children while Grandma babysits the other, and vice versa. It's a special time. NTA", "NTA sorry your mom is shitty.  She has made her choice very clear and you\u2019re not it.  I\u2019d go LC to save yourself from dealing with her whiney excuses.", "NTA\n\nSteve is the only AH here.  Why doesn't he have father son outings at the same time as your mother daughter days?  Makes no sense.  Parents go out all the time separately from siblings.  It's not even an odd thing.", "NTA \nYour mom should make time for you.", "There is really only one AH here and thats Steve. His unreasonable demand that Joey be a part of EVERYONES lives and activity is threatening you and your Mom's relationship. And you dont get this time back. Its perfectly fine to have a girls day. And a Guys day. And an, \"everyone get together and hang out or go to the (zoo, movies amusement park, insert whatever activity you want here) day. Steve unilaterally deciding that Joey must a part of every activity is wrong and an AH move on Steve's part. The solution is an adult discussion and the setting of reasonable parameters going forward.

She is with her stepson every single day. To take a few hours a month to see you shouldn't be a big deal. I'm so sorry.", "NTA", "So by Steve's logic, you getting 1 day a month for mother/daughter time means you're getting favoritism, but when his son lives there 24/7 and sees her daily, that's not seen as anything. If you can't have 1 day for just girls, then there's something wrong. Stay strong and stick to your boundaries. Also, if you can tell other family members to let them know in case he's going around spreading something else. Like, \"Oh, I wanted to do x with mom, but she has to bring the SS because Steve says if we do stuff alone, it's not fair to the kid and showing favoritism.\" It might help your mom see the problem.", "NTA. You are only asking for one or two days a month. I think it's very reasonable to only want to spend that time with your mom. Steve is the AH and you mom need to grow a spine.", "NTA.  Your mom is a grown woman and has free will.  She is choosing to bring your little brother to your outing to keep the peace with her husband.  Don't blame you for opting out.", "NTA, she is choosing her step-son and husband over you. But oh well, she can just see you for Holidays. I know it sucks discovering your mom is so spineless, but she is making her choice. You deserve quality time with your mom, this is true regardless of the age and gender of your siblings. And she is not willing to give it to you.", "NTA, and what a crock from her husband.  I raised three kids and did things separately with each of them, and it wasn't favoring one over the other, it was taking their differences into account and not making one child participate in something just because the other kid wanted to do it.", "NTA, not even a little bit.  I would send your mother a link to this, tell her you are really sad at her stance.  Ask her is she OK, is her husband always this controlling? Show her the thread, show her it's not normal what he is doing.  She could be spineless, she could be in a controlling relationship.  If she is spinless she needs it pointing out, if she is in a controlling relationship she might already know but the voices of strangers might help it hit home.", "Yeah, your mom needs to grow a pair. Having a girls day once or twice a month with your own daughters is not showing favoritism, especially since the kids lives with her. \n\nYou should send your mom a link to this thread. NTA.", "NTA but I'd keep open lines of communication with your mother. You say you've never thought she would be spineless, and that it was Steve's idea, and those aren't exactly green flags when together, you know?\n\nLike, there are very few options for why he'd claim favoritism, and all are less than stellar reason. From not wanting to be a parent, to wanting to isolate your mom, or wanting you out of the picture, they don't bode well.\n\nStand your ground, but keep an eye on the situation and support your mom, just in case.", "OMG.

Besides shouldn't he have 1-on-1 time with his son?  Can you buy tickets to something and say \"Mom, I have a spare ticket to this, would you like to come?\" so that Joey can't tag along?  \n\nOtherwise, I'd say stick to your guns.  We're getting our nails done and going shopping, Joey's presence won't change that.  Tell him to bring a book, or suggest that Step Dad and he do something together.  He'll start protesting to his dad on his own.", "Maybe offer to alternate outings - one just with your mom and the next one including Joey. \n\nIs there anything Steve does one-on-one with Joey?

It is equally possible that mom lied. People blame spouses for crap all the time.", "Is there any way you can meet your mom for lunch during the work day?", "She's an adult with a life. She is wanting to spend two days a month with her mom who she hasn't spent a lot of time with for the last 4 years.", "Her seeing her once a month is having her all to herself? You are the one who needs to grow up what weirdo. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t gone NC ether she just isn\u2019t seeing her because she has to bring her stepbrother.", "Nope op doesn\u2019t want to spend the day babysitting. She wants to spend the day bonding with her mom. So if she can\u2019t spend quality time with mom then I would not go to babysit someone else\u2019s child.\n\n\nPlus if mom can\u2019t grow. Spine and put step dad in his place why would op want to see her. \n\nHer mom just proves op is not a priory so I would not go out of my way to hang with her and her stepson!", "It is. She can\u2019t make her mom change her mind and the mom can\u2019t force the boy on her during their time.", "It\u2019s not no contact, she said she\u2019d still see her at gatherings, and they are clearly still communicating in other ways. Also her goal is to get her Mom to stand up to the controlling husband, it\u2019s not like she wants this. \u201cYou can only see your daughter if my son is with you.\u201d Fuck that", "No, the drive would eat up most of it. I could probably take a half day of PTO but I don\u2019t know if I could do that often", "Young children are often the priority for parents.", "Oh, I understand, I was thinking you need to see your mom in person, without Joey or Steve around, so you can talk to her about how wrong Steve\u2019s demand is and how concerned you are that she is scared to stand up to him.", "12 is not a \u2018young child\u2019. 12 is a child that can look after themselves reasonably well and don\u2019t need to be with their parent/carer constantly while relying on them to fulfil/address all their needs."]}
