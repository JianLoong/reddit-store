He has a now 12 year old son, Joey.\n\nI didn\u2019t live in the house with them for very long and obviously the age difference is big so Joey and I get along but we\u2019re not close at all. He\u2019s a nice kid but I don\u2019t know him super well. He\u2019s very attached to my mom though which I totally get, my mom is awesome. \n\nAfter I graduated this spring, I moved back closer to home (about 30 minutes from my mom). I was really excited to be nearby, we\u2019ve always been really close and I missed her a lot when I was at school.\n\nI wanted to have a dedicated girls day with my mom at least once or maybe twice a month now that I\u2019m home and we got to do that for a couple months but the last two times, my mom has shown up with Joey.\n\nAgain, I like the kid but we were doing stuff like getting our nails done, having lunch at new places, seeing plays\u2026. Joey changes that entirely. Last time we went to the zoo because he wanted to visit the reptile house and then got cheeseburgers. It was fine but that\u2019s not the day I planned with my mom.\n\nWe got into an argument on the phone that night and it came out that Steve has demanded that Joey be included on our days together because he felt that my time alone with my mother was her showing me favoritism. \n\nI didn\u2019t even know what to say, I\u2019ve never known my mom to be so spineless especially when it came to me. It really hurt me to say it but I told her I wasn\u2019t interested in that and if that was my only choice, I guess I would just have to see her on holidays and family gatherings.\n\nShe\u2019s been calling me and begging me to change my mind but she won\u2019t stand up to her husband about it so I\u2019ve just kept apologizing and saying I\u2019m not interested in having a kids day every month.

If she doesn't want to push back it is possible she has learned to be afraid of defying her husband.

Hold firm she needs to be pushed to stand up to him. Personally I see two things happening here I suspect he doesn't want to babysit the son while you are out for a girl's day (most likely) or this is his way of keeping tabs on her.

Your mom's husband is an AH.", "NTA Not to be obvious, why can't your mother plan a separate activity with her stepson?

It also sounds like he's trying to isolate your mother", "NTA.  Sorry, you've lost your mother.  She should step up on this.  Its stupid.  Alternatively, she could propose a plan compliant with Steve's schedule - You and Joey each get an exactly equal number of days with your mother/his stepmother.  If that works, your mother could live with you the first week of the year, and then live with Steve and Joey the second week of the year, repeating so each kid gets exactly 26 weeks.  To ensure pure equality, during your weeks, your mother could go in communicato with Joey and during Joey's weeks, you would reject and refrain from any communication with your mother.", "NTA.\n\nThat's weird and creepy of Steve, controlling too.  You're allowed alone and adult time with your mom, regardless of anyone else (be it a partner, siblings, etc.).  If she can't stand up to him about it, well that sucks, but stay firm on it.", "Nta. Showing favoritism lol, you\u2019re asking to see her once or twice a month and Joey lives with her", "Nta. She\u2019s with him every day.

My guess is that Steve doesn\u2019t want to watch his son alone.", "Steve is the AH here.\n\nJoey is not your sibling, or biologically your mom's child.

Maybe not as often as once a month.\n\nNTA", "Nta honestly stand your ground. Tell your mom you love her but you deserve to have a day just the 2 of you. If she can\u2019t/won\u2019t stand up to her husband then she is the one not fighting to spend time with you.\n\nYou want a girls day not a day spent babysitting. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about favorites, because honestly parent spend one day a month with each bio kid they have, this is about the husband being too lazy to parent his kid.\n\nIf your mom isn\u2019t willing to go out with you just you and prioritize her new husband and step child that\u2019s on her.not you.\n\nYour doing nothing wrong with sitting this boundary.", "NtA \n\nJust bring him to the spa and get his fingernails done also.", "This doesn't sit right. Even if Joey were your bio sibling, parents and kids do things separately. I spend time with one of my children while Grandma babysits the other, and vice versa. It's a special time. NTA", "NTA sorry your mom is shitty.  She has made her choice very clear and you\u2019re not it.  I\u2019d go LC to save yourself from dealing with her whiney excuses.", "NTA\n\nSteve is the only AH here.  Why doesn't he have father son outings at the same time as your mother daughter days?  Makes no sense.  Parents go out all the time separately from siblings.  It's not even an odd thing.", "NTA \nYour mom should make time for you.", "There is really only one AH here and thats Steve. His unreasonable demand that Joey be a part of EVERYONES lives and activity is threatening you and your Mom's relationship. And you dont get this time back. Its perfectly fine to have a girls day. And a Guys day. And an, \"everyone get together and hang out or go to the (zoo, movies amusement park, insert whatever activity you want here) day. Steve unilaterally deciding that Joey must a part of every activity is wrong and an AH move on Steve's part. The solution is an adult discussion and the setting of reasonable parameters going forward.

She is with her stepson every single day. To take a few hours a month to see you shouldn't be a big deal. I'm so sorry.", "NTA", "So by Steve's logic, you getting 1 day a month for mother/daughter time means you're getting favoritism, but when his son lives there 24/7 and sees her daily, that's not seen as anything. If you can't have 1 day for just girls, then there's something wrong. Stay strong and stick to your boundaries. Also, if you can tell other family members to let them know in case he's going around spreading something else. Like, \"Oh, I wanted to do x with mom, but she has to bring the SS because Steve says if we do stuff alone, it's not fair to the kid and showing favoritism.\" It might help your mom see the problem.", "NTA. You are only asking for one or two days a month. I think it's very reasonable to only want to spend that time with your mom. Steve is the AH and you mom need to grow a spine.", "NTA.  Your mom is a grown woman and has free will.  She is choosing to bring your little brother to your outing to keep the peace with her husband.  Don't blame you for opting out.", "NTA, she is choosing her step-son and husband over you. But oh well, she can just see you for Holidays. I know it sucks discovering your mom is so spineless, but she is making her choice. You deserve quality time with your mom, this is true regardless of the age and gender of your siblings. And she is not willing to give it to you.", "NTA, and what a crock from her husband.  I raised three kids and did things separately with each of them, and it wasn't favoring one over the other, it was taking their differences into account and not making one child participate in something just because the other kid wanted to do it.", "NTA, not even a little bit.  I would send your mother a link to this, tell her you are really sad at her stance.  Ask her is she OK, is her husband always this controlling? Show her the thread, show her it's not normal what he is doing.  She could be spineless, she could be in a controlling relationship.  If she is spinless she needs it pointing out, if she is in a controlling relationship she might already know but the voices of strangers might help it hit home.", "Yeah, your mom needs to grow a pair. Having a girls day once or twice a month with your own daughters is not showing favoritism, especially since the kids lives with her. \n\nYou should send your mom a link to this thread. NTA.", "NTA but I'd keep open lines of communication with your mother. You say you've never thought she would be spineless, and that it was Steve's idea, and those aren't exactly green flags when together, you know?\n\nLike, there are very few options for why he'd claim favoritism, and all are less than stellar reason. From not wanting to be a parent, to wanting to isolate your mom, or wanting you out of the picture, they don't bode well.\n\nStand your ground, but keep an eye on the situation and support your mom, just in case.", "OMG.

Besides shouldn't he have 1-on-1 time with his son?  Can you buy tickets to something and say \"Mom, I have a spare ticket to this, would you like to come?\" so that Joey can't tag along?  \n\nOtherwise, I'd say stick to your guns.  We're getting our nails done and going shopping, Joey's presence won't change that.  Tell him to bring a book, or suggest that Step Dad and he do something together.  He'll start protesting to his dad on his own.", "Maybe offer to alternate outings - one just with your mom and the next one including Joey. \n\nIs there anything Steve does one-on-one with Joey?

After few times, your stepbrother might stop wanting to come.", "NTA. You're literally asking for twelve days a year for just you and your mother. The fact that your mother can't give you this shows how much she really cares about you. She's choosing her new husband and her \"fresh start\" over her own child. \n\nI also doubt Steve's claim that his issue with the mother-daughter days was fairness or favoritism. If it was then your mother could arrange to have another day each month for just her and Joey. Steve might be trying to muscle you out of the family.", "Your step dad has taken his own kid hostage. If you and your mom have 1 on 1 time, it's a great opportunity for him to have 1on 1 time with his son. If your mom insists, the fact that he wants to avoid his own kid becomes blatant and unavoidable. Poor kid would be so hurt... and your mom doesn't want him to know that his dad thinks he's a burden. NTA", "op=nta\n\nSteve is AH for insisting on joey being there. Joey gets your mother 29-30.5 days a month(i'm assuming you aren't taking 24 hours for your mom-daughter day).  \n\nInvite your mother to visit you ALONE at your home and then leave it there--if she can't stand up to her husband--then that is her choice--I'm sorry.  \n\nHonestly, I would worry that this level of control may or will become abusive however.", "NTA. Steve\u2019s got a hide and your mother needs to grow a spine. Steve sounds like a jealous little boy who\u2019s been made share his favourite toy. How embarrassing for him. But your mum needs to step up. I\u2019m sorry you got the short end of the stick. There\u2019s no excuse.", "So joey has your mom 24/hr and her husband wouldn\u2019t allow to see you that you\u2019ve been away for months/years? I call it bs. I think the problem here is your step dad", "NTA and it sounds like Step Dad is jealous of your close relationship and wants to make sure his kid is front and center which is really shitty for you.  Your Mom, if she really cares about you, needs to say that she lives with them but only sees YOU once a month and that time is for you two.  That\u2019s it. They either understand or they don\u2019t. You need to reiterate this to her several times and tell her your relationship with her does not involve entertaining her step son. It\u2019s ridiculous. Honestly the Dad is really such a Dick.  I\u2019m sorry you aren\u2019t seeing her but try to stay firm and get her to stand up for you.  Good luck!!", "What 12 year old boy wants to spend time with their mom and sister don't most boys that age just want to hang out in there room, play video games and make there sheets crusty. NTA, but by not spending time with your mom you're giving your stepdad exactly what he wants isolation.", "NTA Joey gets every day with your mother on his own, you are asking for 1-2 days a month. So you want 12-24 days a year with your mom Ona 1 on 1 basis, Joey gets the remaining 300+ (catering for joint days for family events etc). How is this favouritism on your part? Steve is an AH, Joey is meh and your Mom is an AH for letting it happen.\n\nTell her not to be surprised when you move away considering the only reason you moved close was to maintain a relationship with her and she can\u2019t even be bothered to do that.", "NTA \n\nInsist that you be included in everything that Steve and Joey do together \u201cas not to show favoritism.\u201d \n\nAnd literally do every activity you can until Steve gets the picture.", "Op, maybe you should go to her house and leave the house with her in case her husband decides to make a move or something, see how things are at home..", "I would think biological children take precedence over step children.", "He\u2019s twelve and wasn\u2019t mentioned having any kind of disability that makes it so he can\u2019t be left alone. Don\u2019t be callous and say because that OP\u2019s mom has a step kid that kid takes precedence over her first kid.", "And you have no right to demand OP spend time with someone there is no bond with. Also why the hell shouldnt OP be able to spend 1 on 1 time with THEIR mother?", "Joey gets 29 days out of the damn month with OP\u2019s mom, is it so hard for op to get two with their mom just being them?", "Doing a shit job at it.", ">I hope she's ok.\n\nUnfortunately, if she is in an abusive or unhealthy relationship, she has to be the one who chooses to get out of it or demand changes.", "You should remind your mom that she is allowed to have alone time with you. She is an adult, and her husband is not her boss.", "Think again, especially when the stepchildren are minors", "The kid is 12 though. You can leave 12 year olds home (or with friends) for a few hours usually. Or not interact with them for a few hours while you are both in the same house since most 12 year olds can entertain themselves for a while. Though I guess as co-dependent as this kid sounds, maybe not.", " it\u2019s just the fact her mom won\u2019t stand up for her, that\u2019s a relationship killer", "No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Joey at all. I doubt he has any idea that those days were supposed to be for my mom and me. I think Steve tells him something like \u201cyour mom wants to take you out for the day\u201d and then my mom feels like she can\u2019t say no after that. \n\nHe\u2019s more attached to her than I think most boys his age are but he\u2019s a pretty emotionally level kid, he\u2019s not freaking out without her. He just likes spending time with her a lot.", "They\u2019re not friends, that\u2019s like asking you to form a bond with a 4th cousin you only meet every third year.", "Same.   I am an adult whose mom is not \"allowed' to have private conversations without stepdad being around.   They have a shared email account, and he answers her cell.\n\nOPs stepfather is definitely trying to put distance between them.", "I don't think my dad is allowed to have conversations with us if my stepmother isn't in the room and the phone on speakerphone. Like, he won't pick up the phone if she is not immediately available and make some sort of excuse about the cell reception in his house. I don't care because I talk to him about 3 times a year and she succeeded in separating him from his kids over 30 years ago so this is just a continuation of that.", "I'm sorry you're going through this too. It's really hard to watch a parent willingly let someone separate you from them ... and so frustrating to have no chance of getting through to them because the step parent has such a firm grip on their mind.", "I'm upvoting this cause this is the future OP and her mum are looking at if Mum doesn't step up now.", "I'm sorry. Few things are as frustrating as someone coming in and methodically destroying a family ... and the people who are supposed to love and protect us doing nothing to stop it.", "Solution is easily meet at a bar", "Yes, sometimes others need attention too.\n\nThey had a dedicated girl day once or twice a month for a couple of months.
