I love babies and I love that my friends are having babies. When I was pregnant, a lot of people were there for me, including people I hadn't talked to in years. I was so happy and grateful for all of that support, and since then, I've tried to pass that sentiment on.

I know because she told me once, and because Becca and I often end our hang-outs with quick catch-ups about mutual friends.

Carmen has never told me anything about her baby -- she didn't tell me she was pregnant or about the birth, and there was no shower or other announcement. (She doesn't have social media.)

Who responds this way to a congratulatory text?!\n\nSending well wishes and congrats when you hear someone finally got the kid they wanted is never bad. You did nothing wrong here.", "With the information given I'll say NTA.\n\nWhat maybe happened here is that Carmen was unaware Becca was giving you any information about her personal life until you texted, and was upset when she figured it out.\n\nPeople with zero social media tend to be very worried about privacy and if that's Carmen your text may have come as a nasty shock to her. If you know she had a baby when she didn't tell you directly, what else do you know? \n\nIf that's the case and Becca knows Carmen is like that, she would be the AH.

Seriously, I think you might be friends with my sister. This is her exact response to me every time I try to talk to her. Even information she has told me but forgotten. I mention her GD and she gets angry as that was private (she told me), I offer her help with her babies christening and I\u2019m an AH who wasn\u2019t given that information, this happens whenever I talk to her.

NTA, at all. you have a habit (not a bad one, either!) of celebrating this particular event in the lives of your friends and acquaintances and that's what you acted on, here. does she plan on hiding the kid away from everybody that she didn't purposefully select and inform of it's birth? \n\ncarmen is an AH, big time. you were being sweet and she responded with not only something rude to say, but then a block, for (seemingly) no good reason. don't let this stop you from doing what you normally to and celebrating new life with those who should (and will) be thankful and excited that you're sharing in their joy.\n\ni wish i had a friend, like you!", "You say you only see Carmen 2-3 times a year, at Becca's events. It's clear that whatever friendship you and Carmen might have had in the distant past, she checked out of that friendship a long time ago, and you've just been oblivious to it. If she witnessed a lot of your \"super extra\" behavior with other people having babies while she was struggling with infertility, it's understandable if it hurt and she took steps to get away from being exposed to it. \n\nAnd she behaved with class about it; she never confronted or criticized you for being super extra about everyone else's babies, she just went low/no contact with you.\n\nI don't think you're TA for congratulating Carmen as such; I just think YTA a little for being so oblivious and not realizing that you no longer have a friendship with her (if you ever really did), and that your congratulations would not be welcomed. \n\nJust accept that you're not in each other's lives any more, and move on with your life.", "The real villain here is Becca. But still - you shouldn't've sent that text.", "YTA for allowing Becca to gossip to you about anyone else\u2019s private information esp medical informationno matter how minuscule you think it is. If ppl aren\u2019t telling you info or asking for you to around for these things personally it\u2019s bc they don\u2019t WANT/NEED your support and that\u2019s okay. A text should\u2019ve never been sent because you should\u2019ve never known she had a kid until she decided to share that info with you. Id be thinking what else are these 2 AHs discussing about me. What other private info is being passed around w/o my knowledge. A gossiping Patty isnt to be trusted ever and neither is the idiot who just happily engages with them either. Why when you meet up do you not talk about each others lives or shared info that\u2019s known between the 2 of you why get together to gossip about other ppls lives and than act on info you aren\u2019t even supposed to have are you okay. Like are you mentally okay you both look extremely disrespectful and untrustworthy(Becca more bc she\u2019s gossiping and you sitting there like a fox who saw his next meal happily accepting info that isn\u2019t your business). Carmen\u2019s name doesn\u2019t ever need to be mentioned and saying she\u2019s having a hard time with fertility should never be talked about with someone she doesn\u2019t want to share her hard time with. Eww", "She was quiet about it bc she was unsuccessfully trying to keep you and prob many others also from this info. Parents w fertility problems often fear miscarriages and maybe she s paranoid about SIDS. She\u2019s not interested in sharing all this stuff with you, let her be. \n\nThere\u2019s a particularly fragile person and a rabid, possibly inconsiderate babyholic. YTA", "NTA. That seems like a bit of an extreme reaction and there must be more going on here. Having a child is hardly something that can remain a secret. Doesn\u2019t sound like Carmen is your friend at all.", "INFO is it possible that you mentioned her infertility in your message and THAT's the information you weren't supposed to be privy about? She may have not wanted Becca to tell others. Theres' definitely missing information here.", "NTA", "NTA. naw Carmen is an ass that was uncalled for. I would ask Becca what her problem was. That was weird.", "NTA\n\nPlease debrief with Becca and report back!", "INFO: How many times has their fertility come up with her and you in the same conversation, and how long ago was that?\n\nFrom her point of view, can you see how \"random person i barely ever talk to just out of nowhere with pregnancy news i never announced\" would warrant an immediate ghosting?", "Nta", "INFO: What did you do to Carmen?", "YTA stay in your lane. If she wanted you to know, or cared to hear your thoughts on it she would have told you about it herself. She didn't, but you decided that you needed to involve yourself in something in which you knew you weren't wanted anyway.", "But even then that is a weird reaction. \nI would find it a bit weird if a distant acquaintance congratulated me like that, but I would thank them and move on with my life. And maybe give out to my friend if they weren't supposed to share the information.", "Just guessing here, OP sees Carmen as a distant friend/acquaintance but Carmen sees OP as a friend of a friend that she has to interact with from time to time.\n\nTo be clear, OP is NTA and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s done anything wrong and that was a rude and unnecessary thing to say. But she may have not picked up on some signs because they both really like Becca", "This is a really good insight re: privacy and social media. I\u2019m super private and don\u2019t like the idea of friends sharing my life news. I\u2019m not saying Carmen\u2019s reaction was perfect, but I do get it. But still you\u2019re NTA.", "Yeah if OP was all \"congrats on the baby after struggling with infertility\" then it would be a totally understandable response to be all you werent privy to [my private medical] info. I would be a bit freaked if someone I only met a couple of times a year in passing would know my medical history.", "Carmen doesn't talk to OP or even have social media, so how would she know that OP is extra supportive of her friends' pregnancies?", "Excellent points.", "\u2026why?", "reaching. big time.", "are you mental? lol\n\nwas carmen planning on hiding this kid away from all of society, except those whom she elected to tell about it's existence, herself?\n\n\"*you needed to involve yourself in something in which you knew you weren't wanted anyway\" -* probably the most ignorant comment i've read on this entire site. OP stated that she and carmen only interact/see each other about three times a year, max, at special events that involve their common friend. she further stated that becca was the one who informed her about the birth of the child, as well as the struggle that carmen had w/ infertility. it's to be expected that carmen would have the common sense to know that becca would tell OP, and if carmen didn't want OP to know, she should ask becca not to inform her. furthermore, anyone reading this who had common sense, would say it's safe to assume that carmen wouldn't have shared her pregnancy.birth news with OP due to their lack of exposure to one another on a regular basis. i don't go up to people and let them know i had a baby in 2020...because i'm quite certain that other people we know, commonly, have already told them.\n\ncarmen is the AH here. and that rude comment you dropped reeks of a bitter person.", "Exactly. I'm only active on places that allow me to remain as anonymous as I desire, and do not take it well when people share information about me without asking, which may be why I immediately thought that could be the issue here.", "OP has stated that social media is not the only place she is being extra about other people's babies (\"buy big beautiful gifts for every baby shower\") at baby showers at which Carmen is likely present. She is probably also being that way at Becca's get-togethers 2-3 times a year.\n\nIt's also possible that Carmen *does* actually have social media -- but she's had OP blocked for so long that OP doesn't realize she has it. There are a handful of people who've been blocked from my Facebook account since the day I created it 16 years ago. They don't see any of my posts or comments on other people's posts, and they won't see me on their friends' Friends lists, so if it's entirely possible if they ever thought about me that they'd think I don't have social media.", "Why Becca is villain? Because she was told something in confidence and she passed it along. Why OP shouldn't send the text? Because Carmen was hiding it for a reason (of some kind). OP should connect 2 and 2 together and realize telling Carmen her life is less private than she wants is only going to piss her off.", "I'm taking her post at face value when she says she meets Carmen at birthday and Christmas parties, not baby showers.\n\nIt's very possible she unintentionally did something to offend Carmen at an event but my impression is that OP is just friendly and extroverted while Carmen is extremely private. \n\nNeither are wrong but I'm on OP's side. When my parents got sick with the first wave of covid, word got around. Acquaintances and friends I hadn't spoken to in years reached out to offer support. I never posted about it and tbh I really don't like the idea of people talking about me, but I wasn't upset because I know their intentions were good.", "where do you gather that becca was told in confidence? i don't see anything in the story that alludes to becca informing OP that carmen told her she was pregnant/had given birth and asked her to keep it a secret, but that becca was telling OP, in spite of this.\n\nnope. checked again. nothing there.\n\nyou can't insert things into someone's post in order to support your crappy take on the whole thing.\n\ni'm laughing and picturing carmen being in the grocery store or something with her child when he/she is 3YO, walking along beside her, and OP running into them and commenting \"cute kid!\" or something...all to have carmen spazz out and be a complete AH (like she was in the scenario OP shared, here), sounding like a lunatic saying \"you're not privy to knowing i that this is my child!\" LoLoL", "You can't doubt on your judgement when you so casually use ableist language, just so you know.", "> where do you gather that becca was told in confidence?\n\nFrom the text Carmen sent to OP. She would've worded it very differently if she was okay with the world knowing.\n\n> you can't insert things into someone's post in order to support your crappy take on the whole thing.\n\nI'm just taking the most likely explanation. I mean, really, what's more likely to be true - that Carmen is batshit crazy but still maintains an office job and wasn't stripped of parenting rights, or that Becca said a little too much?", "you're really trying....i gotta give that to ya. but you're also really, *really* failing.", "you can't deduce that carmen told becca in confidence from her AH response to OP's sincere congratulatory text. that's a FAR, far reach, at best. nice try, but no. you *still* can't find anything in OP's post that would lead anyone with common sense to believe that becca was told about the pregnancy/birth and told/asked not to share the info with OP/anybody else.\n\ncarmen could very well just be a two-faced adult brat that doesn't even like or (this is more likely) is jeaous of the friendship that OP has with becca and was looking for a way to drive a wedge between them whilst also cutting OP out. she may have only been friendly-ish w/ OP this entire time in fear of losing becca, and truly be one of those immature \"she's *my* friend\" types. her response to OP's kindness definitely reeks of immaturity! \"congrats on the baby\" is FAR from \"too much\".", "One is still batshit crazy if one things one can hide a kid from someone you have in your circle somehow."]}
