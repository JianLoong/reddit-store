But, he's not going to anything just because you are offended.  And legally speaking, it doesn't matter who actually wrote the petition, since it was submitted under his name as the father.  You need to be talking to your lawyer not Reddit.", "INFO there needs to be way more to the story here. Someone just doesn\u2019t start screaming \u201cget your ass in the house\u2026\u201d without anything happening before this.

Hopefully you have or find a good lawyer.", "NTA. If they need the passport does this mean they\u2019re taking your daughter out of the country? Are you sure you want to allow that? Will they come back?", "NTA - You said they're going on an Alaskan Cruise. Unless you're not American or the Cruise leaves from Canada, I do not see any reason why they need her passport. This honestly seems like they might be trying to Kidnap your daughter. Get all the information regarding the trip.", "NTA\u2026who does she think she is speaking at you like that? That\u2019s plain rude and out of line.  If that\u2019s how she acts in public I wonder how she behaves behind closed doors\u2026.she needs to back off and you need to talk to a lawyer.", "NTA. The audacity.  \n\nShe is going to cause more and more trouble.  See a lawyer.", "NTA how dare she talk to you like that. I would tell your ex after that exchange you will no longer communicate with her. All must go through him via text. They don\u2019t need it until July. You have plenty of time. No way I\u2019d have looked for it after being screamed at like that. In fact might want to talk to an attorney.

This is red flag that they could potentially be plotting to take your child.\nIt sounds outlandish at first thought but their behavior all adds up to this, it happens more than people realize.", "ESH.\n\nShe was rude. With that said, a lot of visas and flight bookings etc require the passport number well in advance. If you've been delaying giving them the passport, I can see why she'd be anxious about it.\n\nBut girl, you left him a year ago, have been with another guy for only 7 months and you're already pregnant again. I don't think you have much of a leg to stand on to tell other people to \"take a step back\" when you're clearly rushing things, too.", "YTA", "your life would be more harmonious if you didn\u2019t have such a bad attitude.  You should make more effort at being kind to your husbands new gf because it is better for your CHILD", "NTA If that was going to happen it would have happened. I would tell her that she is his girlfriend and that is it. Any decisions will be made between mother and father. I would also put that in your answer to the modification request.", "NTA, and dude, get kiddo in therapy to give them the tools they need to navigate the bullshit they're undoubtedly wading through at the other house. If that's what's said in front of you, how does she go off when you're not there?", "NTA. Are you documenting this behavior? Take time now to put together a FU folder and speak with an attorney. She might be the one behind the request but it doesn\u2019t look like he knows how to manage her.", "I agree. Although I do NOT like her, I would've been much more receptive if she simply said it like a respectful human being.\n\nI was notified of that by my lawyer. I included it in the story more to show how involved she's making herself than anything else.", "There is some backstory but it would get very long winded. We're both contract RNs and she came to my hospital and basically stalked me and badmouthed me to colleagues. There has always been bad blood from that point. Also, my ex husband never formally introduced us, there was no attempt on his part to bring us together civilly.\n\nEdit: There is definitely no residual jealousy. I wanted to leave him for years. I cannot stand him as a person and leaving was the best decision I ever made.", "i agree", "I have a great lawyer. I have no worries on that great.", "They're going on Alaskan cruise and apparently you need a passport for that. Unfortunately we were very vague in our parenting plan, only requiring 30 days notice.", "It's possible it's starting off in Canada but I'm not 100% sure. We didn't discuss it much prior to the altercation and my lawyer advised me to not speak to him until the civil court matter is resolved.", "This!", "The first sentence is what my lawyer said! Lol. That's how I knew he was hired.", "Secured a lawyer the day after this altercation. I don't need us to be friends. Just civil. I fear it'll never happen though.", "I agree, but I'm new to the \"ex husband has a new gf\" thing so I wanted to be sure. I sent it with her to school today so we don't need to have further contact and I have a great attorney!\ud83d\ude0a", "That's what I thought too. I don't yet know a ton of details about the trip, but I'm assuming it's because they may be going up the coast of Canada?", "I don't think OP is telling her to take a step back in their relationship, but in regards to her getting involved in how these two parents raise their child. I mean, writing a petition to the court to modify the custody agreement is a huge overstep. NTA", "While I did know about the trip for about a week prior, he never specifically asked for the passport until he arrived at my house.\n\nWhile you're certainly entitled to your opinion, I've been pregnant once and it was 12 years ago. So it's not really \"already pregnant again\". It was planned and it's never too soon if you're sure somebody is \"the one\". \n\nNonetheless, thanks for your feedback!\ud83d\ude42", "Can I ask why?", "This comment has got to be a bot because how in the hell would you come to this conclusion when her exes girlfriend screamed that at her out of the car? How are you telling someone who from this post hasn\u2019t said anything negative about the girlfriend at all? It\u2019s almost like blaming the victim.", "I agree, but it has to be mutual. I believe she needs to respect me as the MOTHER before I respect her as a STEPMOTHER.", "My lawyer is already on it!! He's adding a stipulation that she can no longer be present at time sharing exchanges and any and all decisions will involve the parents only. As stated in my OP, I have no issue with her taking on a stepmother role. But she's just that, a stepmother.", "That's my biggest fear! Unrelated to my op, but there are several examples of them both bad mouthing me and him manipulating her against me. She has had therapy sessions since our divorce, but I think you're right in that it's time to make it a more regular thing.", "Why do they need the passport? Does he belong to  a different country?", "You should be able to have it written into the modification that decision will be between mom and dad only.", "Appreciate the response and totally fair that the backstory would be long winded. I wish you and your daughter the best - sounds borderline dangerous that she would come to your hospital to stalk you before ever being formally introduced. Take care of yourself", "Best of luck to you. She sounds exhausting.", "You absolutely do not need a passport for travel within the USA, unless they are heading to another country or starting out in Canada first. OP, this scenario doesn\u2019t sound right. They\u2019re up to something else", "After that interaction, I would\u2019ve told him I couldn\u2019t find it let that be his fucking problem and hers but I\u2019m petty", "Good luck to you.", "Nope, Alaskan cruises only cruise Alaska. \nHonestly when it comes to your child OP there shouldn\u2019t be any assuming, only verifiable facts. \nGiven your history of the animosity between you guys and her getting overly involved so quickly, you need to be concerned. \nI highly recommend sharing these issues with your lawyer and asking for a legally binding itinerary for their trip. Also include mandatory daily check in\u2019s with your child for the duration of the travel in that agreement as well.", "You're correct. I didn't realize the other commenter was insinuating this. I literally could not care less what they do in their relationship. I'm happy for them. This is strictly about her interjecting herself into parenting matters.", "Reacting negatively is pointless.", "If you want respect you treat her with respect", "Nope. We're all in the US. I wasn't 100% sure but will get all the details once the family court situation is over.", "My lawyer is on it!", "If not dangerous, highly annoying!! I was there long before her and had to leave and take a lesser paying contract at another hospital to avoid the animosity and drama. Thank you!", "Thanks. It's been a nightmare lol.", "That's what I thought too. I'm like \"do they realize Alaska is part of the US\"? My only assumption is if they were traveling up the coast of Canada it would be needed?", "I can be petty but when it involves my daughter's happiness I have to concede. She's excited about the trip. Anything else and I would've been much less cooperative.", "Thank you!", "That is solid advice. I may do that just to be safe. Not to mention that this trip is conveniently planned during MY week with her. I believe the civil matter will be over quickly so I can then resume communication with him and get details. Thanks for the input!", "Sorry, respect to the MOTHER comes first.", "Most Alaska cruises stop for a few hours in Victoria, B.C. You must show passport to leave and reboard the ship.", "So even if this philosophy of yours is detrimental to your child\u2019s well being, you will still stick to it ?", "That makes sense! I'm sure it's something along those lines. He's a dick but I don't think he's trying to kidnap her lol.", "I have never NOT treated her with respect. I've never even spoken a word to the woman until she came to my house yelling at ME. So yes, I'll be sticking to my guns on this one. It's not a detriment to my child's well being on my part. If anything, it's the constant bad mouthing of me to my daughter that she tells me about every week I have her. You can spin it anyway you like, she's the outsider. In what world does it make sense that I have to earn HER respect first? Respect me as the mother and I'll give you every ounce of respect in return."]}
