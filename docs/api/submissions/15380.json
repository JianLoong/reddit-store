This is red flag that they could potentially be plotting to take your child.\nIt sounds outlandish at first thought but their behavior all adds up to this, it happens more than people realize.", "ESH.\n\nShe was rude. With that said, a lot of visas and flight bookings etc require the passport number well in advance. If you've been delaying giving them the passport, I can see why she'd be anxious about it.\n\nBut girl, you left him a year ago, have been with another guy for only 7 months and you're already pregnant again.

I would also put that in your answer to the modification request.", "NTA, and dude, get kiddo in therapy to give them the tools they need to navigate the bullshit they're undoubtedly wading through at the other house.

I included it in the story more to show how involved she's making herself than anything else.", "There is some backstory but it would get very long winded. We're both contract RNs and she came to my hospital and basically stalked me and badmouthed me to colleagues. There has always been bad blood from that point.

As stated in my OP, I have no issue with her taking on a stepmother role. But she's just that, a stepmother.", "That's my biggest fear! Unrelated to my op, but there are several examples of them both bad mouthing me and him manipulating her against me.

Does he belong to  a different country?", "You should be able to have it written into the modification that decision will be between mom and dad only.", "Appreciate the response and totally fair that the backstory would be long winded.

Also include mandatory daily check in\u2019s with your child for the duration of the travel in that agreement as well.", "You're correct. I didn't realize the other commenter was insinuating this. I literally could not care less what they do in their relationship. I'm happy for them.

It's been a nightmare lol.", "That's what I thought too. I'm like \"do they realize Alaska is part of the US\"? My only assumption is if they were traveling up the coast of Canada it would be needed?", "I can be petty but when it involves my daughter's happiness I have to concede. She's excited about the trip. Anything else and I would've been much less cooperative.", "Thank you!", "That is solid advice. I may do that just to be safe. Not to mention that this trip is conveniently planned during MY week with her. I believe the civil matter will be over quickly so I can then resume communication with him and get details.

I've never even spoken a word to the woman until she came to my house yelling at ME. So yes, I'll be sticking to my guns on this one. It's not a detriment to my child's well being on my part. If anything, it's the constant bad mouthing of me to my daughter that she tells me about every week I have her. You can spin it anyway you like, she's the outsider. In what world does it make sense that I have to earn HER respect first? Respect me as the mother and I'll give you every ounce of respect in return.", "Obviously NTA wtf. I gotta say after that, I wouldn't let your ex take daughter on a trip with her. Who tf does she think she is demanding things from you?", "INFO: how old is your daughter?", "NTA   I'm glad you have a lawyer and are handling it the right way.  I'm sure someone else suggested it, but document everything.  Get as many receipts as you can.", "I don't believe he knows how to manage her. I definitely wore the pants in our relationship and I imagine it's no different with her. He's very simple and passive. I have started documenting everything since the recent altercation, as requested by my lawyer.", "Document everything and get witness statements. You never know when you will need it", "Talk it over with your lawyer of course, but there's likely some alienation happening.  Whether it's enough to make a difference to a judge?  That's what lawyers are for.", "chillax, there's a whole canada between alaska and the lower 48. the cruise ship will be docking along the way in canadian waters.", "Have been on it!! Thanks foe the input\ud83d\ude42", "All Alaskan cruises are NOT just Alaska. Ex-travel agent here.", "That's not true. Many Alaskan cruises stop in BC, which is part of Canada and would require a passport to leave the ship. We're actually a whole separate country.", "Sorry, but you and many other people in the comments, are completely wrong about this. The VAST majority of cruises to Alaska will stop in Canada or originate/terminate there and therefore require a passport to board.\n\nThis is due to the Passenger Vessel Services Act which requires a foreign flagged ship \u2013 a huge majority as registering a ship in the US has difficult and costly requirements to fulfill \u2013 sailing from the US to call on a foreign port as part of the itinerary. For the same reason cruises to Hawaii will stop in Mexico along the way. It's a very old law originally meant to protect US shipping companies from foreign competition.", "Good job! She doesn't know who she is messing with! \ud83d\ude02", "And make sure your lawyer knows about the act of verbal abuse. I mean, let them decide what to do with the information, but make sure they know.", "Unless he has discussed with you plans for international travel, why would he need her passport? That is a big red flag.", "You\u2019re welcome. There\u2019s just so many red flags I had to say something. \nIt\u2019s always better to come across as a fiercely protective \u201chelicopter\u201d mom than have something happen and endure suffering. \nI work in pediatric mental healthcare, a work friend specializes in custody assessments and the things I learn about adults doing can just be horrifying. \nKeep being her steadfast advocate and congrats on your current pregnancy, OP.", "I\u2019ll refer to you on that as that\u2019s your forte, thank you for the insight.

I appreciate you taking your time on such well thought out comments\ud83d\ude42", "Depending on the cruise, some companies can require passports even for cruises to Alaska, especially if there's a stop in Victoria, BC.\n\nDoes your ex or his gf have any foreign citizenship?  Could they conceivably abduct your daughter overseas and not come back?  There are a lot of parental child abductions in and out of the US.", "If Canada is a stop ...", "OP make no assumptions. Do your due diligence and make sure a passport is needed for their trip. And require an itinerary before they leave.", "Do either of them have Canadian citizenship?", "NTA in any way, shape, or form.\n\nJust curious though- what kind of modifications did she want made to the parenting plan? Were they things that would lead to potential parental alienation (given how you said both her and your ex bad mouth you to her)?", "NTA. Um personally I wouldn\u2019t be ok with them taking my daughter out of the country.", "Not to doubt your relationship seeing as you\u2019re already pregnant, but next time, you should BOTH wait a decent period of time before introducing your partners to your kid. You need to make sure you guys know and are comfortable with who your new partners are and after 7 and 8 months, it really doesn\u2019t seem like enough time has passed for either of them to be taking on any sort of parental role or going on trips or things like that. Moving on takes time. Rushing it can lead to some really crappy outcomes. It\u2019s harder when you have a kid, but her well being and safety needs to come before either of your desires to have a new happy family.", "NTA. And after that exchange they wouldn\u2019t see a passport. Definitely no international travel.", "OooooWeeee, that would have had me over the No-Sense line in 2.5 seconds.

Seems a bit hypocritical.", "Wait, why is it planned during your week with her? Cruises leave literally every week- they didn\u2019t HAVE to go your week.", "If it's your week, you don't have to allow her to go.", "Indeed, someone let me know so I edited my comment. Thank you though.", "Yup! Someone else already mentioned that, I learn something new every day on Reddit. Thank you for the further insight", "Seems odd to me that you would just send over the passport without having many more details about the trip."]}
