Have fun in bora bora! That sounds amazing", "NTA.  Your honeymoon has been planned, childcare has been arranged and your friend's wedding is short notice.  Making sure that people are available to attend is why Save the Date cards are a thing!  Enjoy your honeymoon!  It sounds amazing!", "It's Monday. You are leaving Thursday? And you still haven't booked your tickets or hotel?   That's crazy.", "NTA.\n\nBut I also want to call out a minor detail: You agreed to let someone propose at your wedding. That is a very generous attitude to have, and kudos to your friend's boyfriend for asking first. Some people propose at weddings without telling anyone and it can upstage the bride & groom. You all sound like a nice group of people (other than your friend's mother.)", "NTA. So, not only did they get engaged *at your wedding*....they planned their wedding *the same week as your honeymoon*. You understand what's happening here, right? I don't know why they feel the need to upstage you in such an extreme and heavy-handed way, but....y'all better go have fun in Bora Bora.

Wait, that won\u2019t happen - you couldn\u2019t even wait a week before harassing us about  not placing enough importance on *your* wedding, when it hadn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nLove (well, marriage),\nOP\u201d \n\n\nETA: to anyone planning a wedding, please know, if a particular date is important to you, you have to deal with people maybe not being able to attend. If (and only if!) a particular *person* is important enough to you that they **need** to be there, you need to check dates with them **before** you book.", "NTA. Not even remotely a thought. It's your honeymoon, you have plans. It's not like you guys were going to have a date night or something, you have tickets, travel, *other people* involved.\n\nTell her mom to kick rocks while you guys sip on cocktails with umbrellas. Enjoy your trip!", "NTA \n\nThe obvious argument is that they could postpone their wedding since they just decided on it. You already had plans and made arrangements. It doesn't matter that the tickets weren't bought yet.", "NTA. You already let them have an engagement announcement at your wedding which was INCREDIBLY nice of you. You were also there for her so her mom\u2019s insinuation that the relationship is one sided or that \u201cyou owe her\u201d is complete bullshit and tbh I would reconsider the friendship. Go on your beautiful honeymoon knowing that your brother was at your wedding and your little ones are taken care of. Anything else is pure noise, ignore them or block them if they can\u2019t pull their heads out of their asses.", "NTA, wow your best friend demands you move your honeymoon because she decided to schedule her wedding at the same time, to say she is somewhat selfish is the understatement of what's left of this year. Enjoy your honeymoon.", "NTA.", "NTA.  It's not like the wedding can't happen if you're not there.  This is  such short notice and you have everything planned already re kids etc.  \"Completely blowing their wedding\" is just a tad dramatic, and you're \"not being there for them\" isn't like you're ditching a commitment that will require them to change their plans.\n\nEnjoy your get-away, your friend's wedding will take care of itself.", "NTA \n\n You couldn't postpone without having to pay more than you can afford.

My bff would never want me to miss my big exciting trip to accommodate her last min plans, because true friends do not do things like that. Enjoy your trip with zero regrets!", "NTA. If you only give people a little notice, don't expect a lot of people. You had plans that were painstakingly made.", "NTA, but I don't get why would you tell her you didn't buy tickets...", "These people obviously aren't from my country, we have to fill in an \"intention to marry\" I think it's called, and register our plan to wed 30 days in advance, or it won't be a legally binding marriage. Who on earth cancels their plans for such short notice?!"]}
