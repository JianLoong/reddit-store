Ive never been close to my moms side of the family, they\u2019ve never tried to be involved at all no matter how much I tried. Last year my moms sister (F 28) found out she was pregnant with her first baby, she\u2019s struggled with infertility for years so obviously everyone was overjoyed, including me. We hung out plenty times after and i would constantly tell her about my plans for my quince and how it lands exactly on my birthday. Fast forward to the month shes due, shes past due and gets a list of days she able to get induced she chose my birthday. Her reasoning being \u201cThe baby\u2019s first birthday will land of a Saturday, perfect.\u201d After i trusted her and loved and supported her through her whole pregnancy this is how she repays me. Day of my quince as expected none of my moms family shows. Just my dads side and my friends as well as girlfriend. To say the least the moment i checked instagram and saw my moms family at the babys party, i just broke down in my girlfriends arms. I tried to enjoy the rest of my day but it was hard knowing my own family chose a party the kid wont even remember over something ive been dreaming of and waiting for sense i was 8. My mom told her cousin about this and yk how it is in Hispanic familys, everyone knew the next day and now im being called a ungrateful brat. I just wanted my family there for once, and i couldn\u2019t even have that.", "created_utc": 1668294174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytl49s/aita_for_getting_upset_that_my_moms_side_chose_a/", "score": 354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I recommend spending more time with your Dad and his family.  NTA.", "NTA. Baby's firsts are all about the parents, not the baby themselves. I believe, with a few exceptions, you don't even start forming permanent memories until you're 2. \n\nI'm not going to make a comment about her getting induced- her medical shit is her business- but she could have had the party after/before yours.", "NTA. The baby won\u2019t remember their first birthday and it\u2019s understandable why you\u2019re frustrated. Your aunt is TA for not licking a different day for the party . Very inconsiderate on her part.", "NTA\n\nTHEY are calling you a brat?\nDid they pay for the party? \nDid they send you gifts and cash? \n\nThey can stuff it. \n\nWhere was your mom in all of this? \nDid she speak up and say to her sister \u201chey my daughter\u2019s quince is that day\u201d?", "NTA. She could've chosen any other day and chose your birthday", "NTA.\n\nThey are even calling an \"ungratful brat\"? Definetly a RED FLAG. I would honestly try speaking with them and I would ask why are they treating you this way. And one question, since in the text it wasn't mentioned: was your mom at your Quinceanera? Did the family sent you gifts or money?\n\nBtw, never ever expect to be repayed for supporting sb.", "NTA - Happy Birthday, sorry for what happened to you \nYour mom and her side of the family sucks , it was your birthday", "NTA - your party was planned before that child was even born. I don\u2019t care when the baby\u2019s 1st birthday landed, the aunt chose to have the party on the same day as your quincea\u00f1era because she\u2019s an asshole.\n\nIt\u2019s not a sign of immaturity to be hurt that she forced your family to pick between the two of you, and that they chose her celebration instead. \n\nI\u2019m sorry she did that to you, it\u2019s not okay.", "NTA - sure a babys first birthday is one of the \"special\" ones but its about the parents not the baby - baby wont have permanent memories for a while \n\n\\-she had a list of dates to choose from and knew what your plans were, she chose that one ( but thats her health shes considering so we shouldnt judge on that) - she could have arranged the babys birthday celebration for a different day/time \n\n\\- your mums family chose the baby cel;ebration - take time and focus on your relationship with dads side more for support", "(NTA)\n\nNah! They\u2019ve been doing this to you even before the baby was born!? Cut them out of your life. They just proved to you that you mean nothing to them.", "You're NTA. How can you be ungrateful when you have received nothing from them?", "NTA because intentionally choosing your birthday is really weird and will now cause a conflict every year.", "Nta", "NTA. Your aunt and your mothers family were brutally unkind. To schedule the party for a bay who has no idea what\u2019s going on anyway the day of your Quinceanera is petty and small minded.", "Oh honey I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you on a day you deserved all about \nThe fact it was a first birthday that could have easily put it off for a day or two NTA", "NTA.  Happy Quinceanera! Sorry half your family are AHs.", "You're NTA. Neither is your aunt--having a baby is difficult, and there are a lot of decisions to make, and her hormones are all over the place. But I don't get why her entire family had to wait around for the baby to arrive. So they're TA for brushing you off when they could have shared your special moment and then gone to meet the baby after.", "Ask your parents to go NC with that side of the family.", "NTA.  If you ever decide to marry, you won\u2019t have to worry about invitations for that side of the family.", "NTA.  Sorry, sweetie!  Happy birthday, anyway!  You are still your wonderful self, and they are the kind of people who missed out on your quince for a lame baby's party.  Hold your head up, and don't let them get you down.", "NTA and calling you a grateful brat? Seems like they're lashing out because they can't cope with guilt, immature much.", "NTA.  I hope you tell them all to shove it!", "NTA", "NTA. Cut all those people off permanently.", "First, I am so sorry that you had to deal with this. You\u2019re 100% NTA here and I don\u2019t want you to think for a second you are. \n\nI know how hard it is to feel abandoned by your family and then have them place the blame at your feet for it. It feels shitty, and it feels even shittier when someone\u2019s trying to tell you that your ungrateful for having your feelings hurt. But you\u2019re entitled to your emotions, and anyone\u2019s reasonable reaction would be to be hurt. Keep your chin up, you\u2019re going to go far and do amazing things I\u2019m sure. \n\nDon\u2019t let a group of assholes let your head hang low, even if they\u2019re family.

Focus your energy on the half that showed up and don't expect much from the half that didn't. There were a lot of ways to make this work, but the adults on your moms side didn't look for solutions. Do not waste energy trying to coddle them or concerning yourself with how they feel", "First birthday parties are usually huge. Parents are always very excited to celebrate all the first milestones. You expected your aunt to not have her mother there on the baby's first birthday? ESH. You could have mentioned that you didn't like having your birthday shared with your aunt. She may have kept the date, but pregnancy is difficult and sometimes you have limited options. One of you could have had your party at lunch, and the other a little later. I don't know why this wasn't discussed prior to the parties.", "Was wondering the same thing. What have they done to be grateful for? They weren't even there. Maybe OP should be grateful for not having a bunch of AH there", "This times 100. A baby's first is really a parent's party. You're 15, she's almost 30, she should have been mature enough to accomadate you.", "Where I'm from, first birthday parties are HUGE. Like, 300 people huge. It's the baby's coming out party, where the whole family, both sides, extended, from out of state/country all come to meet. There's a lot of ethnic beliefs about raising children involved that make a first birthday a family wide expectation. It's not at all about the parents.\n\nThat being said, OP is NTA for wanting her family to be there for her.", "Meet the baby? The kid is a year old.", "[removed]", "Not to mention most people don\u2019t give birth the day they\u2019re induced. It\u2019s not a fast process especially for a first time mom. I really doubt she planned the day to get the first birthday on a Saturday. That just sounds exaggerated. NTA for wanting your family there, but the baby\u2019s birthday is also important to the family. Sharing birthdays isn\u2019t fun but it happens.", ">One of you could have had your party at lunch, and the other a little later. \n\nYou clearly don't know what a quincenera is.", "A quincea\u00f1era is a huge deal for a girl.

I mean literally an early brunch, baby smashes the cake and \"opens\" their gifts...boom, bam, over in time for people to change and be to your party later in the day!", "I agree... NTA.  That aunt did all this on purpose. She seriously couldn't make the birthday party Sunday???? \n\nI hate that this happen to OP. OP sweetie, First i would like to say happy birthday sweetie!!!  I understand being upset when your own mom's family doesn't attend, but think of it like this.

Your timeline is confusing.", "I'm not sure that's true. OP says auntie got pregnant last year..... I'm not sure in this situation whether \"first birthday\" means \"day they turned 1\" or \"day they were born\". If the latter, I don't think the family are AHs for prioritising it.", "How does being upset that your family didn\u2019t show up for you make you an ungrateful brat? \n\nBut maybe you should be grateful they are showing you now where they stand, a first birthday is more important than yours. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t invite anyone who didn\u2019t come to this very important birthday to any future parties.

It would be different if she chose the day before but still ended up delivering in your birthday. \n\nNTA!", "NTA, she obviously knew the first birthday fell on a Saturday because you told her. She did you dirty and its quite unfair how no one sees anything wrong w it.

Did she even talk to her or said anything like  ? \"Hey ummm that's day of my daughter's quincea\u00f1era.\" They even send you gifts or even paid for the party,venue your dress decontions???

If I were you I'd just act like that entire side of the family doesn't exist anymore.

This was deliberate and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.  Their defensive and aggressive attitude is validation that it was deliberate.
