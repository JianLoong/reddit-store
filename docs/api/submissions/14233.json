{"id": 14233, "submission_id": "12er4vt", "title": "AITA for refusing to attend my half sister's wedding with my grandparents?", "selftext": "There's some backstory here to explain some stuff that I need to get out of the way first. My mom was married before my dad. Had my half sister Sarah. When Sarah was 2 her dad cheated on mom and mom divorced him. When Sarah was 4 mom met my dad and they got married when she was 5. Sarah's dad was angry that my mom moved on and was an ass to my dad. He tried to interfere in my parents relationship and then he came between Sarah and my dad. It worked and Sarah would reject my dad, call him names and say her dad was better than him. My mom put Sarah into therapy, took Sarah's dad to court to try and end his alienation of my dad. The courts gave my mom primary custody but Sarah still saw her dad every other weekend and he still got like a month with her in the summer. Sarah and my dad's relationship improved a little but summer's were never a great time. Sarah was 9 when I was born. Almost 11 when her dad died.\n\nThat ended all progress between my dad and Sarah. She went back to calling him names and rejecting him. She hated him so much that she hated me too and she was either a jerk to me or she'd ignore me. Mom already had Sarah in therapy to help her cope with the loss of her dad but she also added therapy for the two of them to try and figure out if she could do anything to help her and my dad's relationship. Mom ended up telling Sarah the truth behind the divorce with the help of a therapist when she became a teenager and nothing had changed with how she felt about my dad. Sarah told mom he was still her dad and my dad was an asshole. Sarah still loved mom and they were generally close. But when Sarah was graduating from high school she insisted that my dad was not welcome. Mom told Sarah that she loved her but she couldn't treat my dad like crap and couldn't expect her to leave him behind all the time. Sarah told mom it was dad + me or her. Mom said she wouldn't choose between us and there was a compromise somewhere surely. Sarah cut off mom and hasn't spoken to her since. Neither have I.\n\nShe stayed in touch with our shared grandparents. They were invited to her wedding which is happening this month and were given a +1 to bring along a family friend that Sarah was close with. They told my parents and my parents and grandparents decided I should go in the friend's place. They say since I'm her brother and her issues are with my mom and dad, this could start to repair things between us. I heard them talk about it and told them I didn't want to go. My parents dismissed me saying I'm 17 and still their kid so of course I'm going. I told them no and thought they might listen. But it's being insisted on. Dad said not to let her hate for him come between us and mom said this is our chance to redevelop our relationship. I told her there was nothing to redevelop because we never had one. My parents begged and I refused to go. They and my grandparents are angry that I'm \"being so stubborn\".\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680885504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12er4vt/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_half_sisters/", "score": 421, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All that is going to likely happen if your grandparents bring you instead of the family friend they were intended to bring, is that your half-sister also ends her relationship with her grandparents.\n\nAnd they'd deserve it.", "NTA, you don't have to have a  relationship with your sister, if neither of you wants it. Also, does your sister know you are supposed to come? Even though she behaved like an ass in the past, that was largely her dad's fault, and springing this on her on her wedding day is unfair.", "NTA  this is a horrible idea.  She did not invite you & when you show up, surprise!  It would not go well.  This is absolutely not the right event for a surprise reunion.   Stick to your guns!  Do not let your parents & grandparents put you in this awkward position that will  NOT  have the result they hope.", "NTA. You are being asked to be the catalyst to fixing a problem you didn't create, a problem that is so much bigger than what it seems you are prepared to handle.\n\nDo they intend to sneak you in? Does your sister know what they are planning? This could do so much damage to any potential relationship you may have with her in the future, not to mention what it could do to you personally, if your sister freaks out because of this.\n\nYou have a right to say no. What they are asking may seem reasonable in their eyes but I guarantee they are not thinking this all the way through.", "NTA you don\u2019t have a relationship with your sister and randomly showing up on her wedding day probably won\u2019t improve that. The plus one was not sent for you and your parents&grandparents do not get the right to fill it with whoever they choose. I\u2019d find somewhere else to be that weekend so you aren\u2019t taken along for the ride.", "NTA.\n You can't force halves/steps, and it sounds like y'all won't ever see eye to eye. It's a shame, but there you go.\nI suspect you'd be unwelcome anyway.", "NTA.  If you are being stubborn so are they.  You have very good reason not to attend as she has treated both you and your dad very poorly.  A wedding isn't necessarily a good place to start to heal a rift.", "NTA - there\u2019s no point in you going to this wedding at all.", "NTA - but you need to talk to your parents and grandparents again.  A wedding is her special day.  It is not a therapy session to fix a broken relationship.  Your half sister believes the plus 1 is a family friend that she wants at the wedding.  If she wanted you, she would have invited you.  She didn\u2019t.  When you walk in, her seeing you will ruin her day and ruin her relationship with the grandparents.\n\nIf your parents and grandparents want her to reconcile with you, that is on them to talk to her or for your grandparents to invite you and her to their house for a therapy,f ox the relationship session.\n\nAmbushing her at her wedding is a way to permanently break your relationship with her.  She broke the relationship.  It\u2019s on her to mend it and that isn\u2019t going to happen on her wedding day.  If she wanted to mend the relationship, she would have invited you.\n\nPoint these things out to your parents and grandparents.  They can\u2019t fix this and neither can you because none of you broke it.  She did.  Your grandparents run a very high risk of breaking their relationship with her if they bring you.\n\nAfter you say all of this, if they are still not convinced, then ask your grandparents to notify her that they are bringing you.  If they still refuse and still demand that you go, I would suggest that you go.  If you don\u2019t go, they will misplace their anger at the situation on you and blame you for not fixing the relationship.  If you go, it will blow up, and you will be able to say I told you so, and they will not be able to misplace their anger at the situation on you.  If you go, be polite and respectful regardless of what happens.", "NTA. You can't fix what never was.", "They can't force you to go to the wedding and even if you did go I'm not so sure it would be a drama free experience. NTA OP because you said it best that you can't redevelop something that was never there to begin with. If she had wanted you there she would have invited you, but to show up and surprise here with a \"Congratulations, Mom wants us to start getting along on your big day!\" would not be received well.", "OP, this is not your problem- she has been a stranger to you- best to leave it that way. NTA.", "NTA  just tell your parents and grandparents that they will make a bigger mistake by forcing you when you wasn't invited. How would she feel if they showed up with you right before her wedding. This isn't the time nor should it be you reaching out like your parents and your grandparents want to do or have you do. She is the one that cut contact wants nothing to do your family in the first place. If anything it should be her reaching out.", "NTA. Nor will you going instead of the family friend Sarah expects rebuild any relationship. She is likely to see you, being someone she didn\u2019t invite, as a betrayal and cause all kinds of problems even if she didn\u2019t, it\u2019s her wedding. You won\u2019t be able to talk or reconnect even if she wanted to. The day isn\u2019t about that but her and her new husband. What a terrible idea your parents and grandparents have. I\u2019m sorry for the relationship that never was but you are definitely NTA", "NTA, she clearly doesn\u2019t desire a relationship on fair terms, so don\u2019t give her an excuse.", "NTA - Sarah made it clear that she didn't want you in her life, lumping you in with your dad. If anyone is going to make the first steps toward healing that relationship, it should be her, not you. it is not your responsibility to heal the harm that she caused.\n\nAlso, attending the wedding as a +1 when she specifically demanded that you no longer be in her life is not only sneaky, it has the potential to ruin her wedding. She doesn't *want* you in her life, so not only are your parents ignoring your wishes, they're ignoring *her* wishes too. And while her wishes are pretty shitty, that doesn't mean that *her wedding day* is the appropriate time to disregard them.", "NTA.  Even if you wanted to develop a relationship with your half-sister, showing up at her wedding in place of a family friend would not be a good way to do it.  Stand your ground, OP.", "NTA. I can't believe they think surprising her with you which is acceptable behavior??  If you want to get your family off your back, tell them you'll go but only if your half-sister approves it first. I'm going to take a wild guess and say she would not be cool with you being there so that should solve things. \n\nAlso, in this hypothetical scenario where you go unannounced to her wedding, what about the other family friend who the ticket was originally for? Do they just have to miss the wedding?", "NTA. Your grandparents are indulging in a deluded fantasy. This is an ambush, and no one reacts well to being ambushed. Your grandparents are trying to make your half sister's wedding day about themselves and their opinions on her family relationships. It's a terrible idea--it's self serving, disrespectful, and doomed to fail. Your take is correct, stand your ground and don't do it.", "NTA, if you can somehow get word to Sarah about what they are doing you should. At minimum she wouldn't be surprised if they force you to go. If you do end up being dragged to the wedding be nothing but apologetic and duck out as soon as you can. Arrange a ride or get an Uber if necessary.", "NTA. She cut off contact with you and hasn't spoken to you in years. I wouldn't go either.", "Do not go!  This will end badly for everyone, especially you.  Your grandparents may also find themselves in the same position your parents are in right now if they push this.    I would not be surprised if Sarah had security at her wedding ready to deny the three of you access if you show up.  I would sit down with all of them, ask them why they think you won't be turned away at the door.  If they say that won't happen remind them that there was no invitation to you three for a reason.  They are setting you, and themselves up for serious problems.\n\nIf they won't listen to reason, I hate to say this, but find a way to let Sarah know their plan so she can decide to stop it.  Underhand maybe, but a wedding is not the time or place for this kind of thing.  It is also Sarah's choice who she wants there.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. That's a horrible idea.  Its unfortunate that your sister's father was able to alienate her so thoroughly that she doesn't want a relationship with you but it is what it is at this point.  You showing up at her wedding would go horribly.  She clearly does not want you there and would see your presence as an affront. I don't know how your parents and grandparents don't see that.\n\nIs it possible to let your sister know that this is what they are planning to do?  I think she is probably the only one that could shut this down completely.  Try to appeal to your parents again but if they won't budge, I would try to make myself scarce that day. You're 17 not 12, more than old enough to decide if this is something you want to do.", "NTA. The first point is that you have a right no matter your age to say you don't want to do something because It makes you uncomfortable. The second point is, does your half sister even know that they're trying to bring you? If she doesn't, this is a fight at a wedding that nobody should be having. If they want to try to get you guys to reconcile a wedding is not the place.", "NTA. She asked your mom to leave you as well as your father. She clearly has issues with you too.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would YOU want to repair relations with that AH?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents are an AH to push THEIR failed relationship with their child on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: You are NOT even invited .. why would you wnat to face TGHAt drama so your parents and grandparents can have their assholish satisfaction of \"having tried\"?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are NOT a reasonable \"+1\" ... It would be as reasonable to bring dad or mom, and THEY actually want to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**YOUR PARENTS are AH for trying to draw you into THEIR drama.**", "NTA!  Wow your mom, dad and grandparents are not only stupidly stubborn but clueless about how family re-connection works. In fact THEY are acting like AHs. \n\n I'm guessing no one has told your sister about the switcheroo on the plus one.  If that is the case they are setting up something that estranged adult kids refer to as an \"ambush\". This is one of the tactics most hated in the estranged community and to do it at your sister's wedding is almost guaranteed to that the No Contact your sister currently has in place with your parents becomes a life long commitment on her part. \n\nThe worst thing is that your family is using you.....a minor and (for want of a better term) a non-combatant... as their weapon of choice.  This is not your battle to fight. If they want to reconcile with your sister they need to handle it themselves. (Based on how they are trying so hard to coerce you into doing it makes me think that maybe your sister has a point about your parents.)  \n\nFurthermore if your sister is \"surprised\" by your attendance it will possibly ruin any chance of you reconciling with her in the future. She may not understand or believe that you were forced into this. If you cannot convince your parents to drop this is there anyway you could give your sister a heads up about what is going on?  It will probably cause a blow up, but a blow up before the wedding is far better than one at it.  Good luck!", "NTA and this is not going to rebuild this relationship. Your half sister although has been wrong on how she dealt with your mom and dad has the right to invite who she wants to the wedding. Planning a bait and switch is going to cause her to hate you even more. It\u2019s also going to cause her to cut off all contact with her grandparents.\n\nIt is wrong to invite someone to a wedding you know is unwanted. If your half sister wanted you there she would have told your grandparents that the plus one was for you.\n\nWhat your parents and grandparents are doing g is wrong. \n\nI would reach out to sister and let her know through social media the plan to do a bait and switch for the wedding. I figure your sister will put a stop to it.", "NTA you are 100% doing the right thing. Honestly I just feel terrible for Sara. There's no such thing as alienation to a step parent. Her feelings about your dad based on her history and the way mom seems to have really tried to force it (in re: trying to get full ass custody over it)...make a lot of sense.", "NTA\n\nIf it gets too messy (sounds like it already has) you should probably just go so you don't have to hear about it for the rest of your life.\n\nIt's free food and you can suck it up for half a day to keep things cool with your parents and grandparents. \n\nThey're wrong for forcing you to go, but families are weird and their intentions are good.\n\nA wedding isn't a big enough deal to fall on your sword to avoid.\n\nOn reflection just go, act civil/behave, fake your way through it and be the bigger person.\n\nYou'll score major points with the people you actually care about and you can cut her off completely when you're living your own life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That of avoiding drama with the sisters wedding.\n\nI do see a problem though. The parents/grands aren't thinking rationally. If he does make himself scarce and the grands go without him, that will leave them open to deluding themselves. To developing a story in their minds that \"if he'd just gone... everything would have worked out\". They'll see OP as the \"bad guy\" for ruining their storybook reunion, instead of the hero that was saving them from their own folly.

I won't deny that your half sister's father influenced her negatively BUT your parents' current behavior sounds to me like they were trying a father daughter relationship between your father and your half sister.

The almost forcing you to go to the wedding simply shows that your parents are at least partially to blame for the situation. NtA", "NTA. Doesn't really sound like you would be welcome.", "NTA.

Not even movies have this kind of plot xD. What is going on in their heads?", "The fact your parents think this is a sane, ok thing to do makes me suspect Sarah has good reasons for cutting contact with them. You were a little kid and innocent in all of this and it sucks that she took out her anger at your parents on you too, but this is about the opposite of how a good parent goes about trying to foster a better relationship between their child and their spouse.", "Parents and grandparents desperately want a reconciliation and they see OP as the designated envoy.

That wasn\u00b4t an attack.", "Like some other commentor already suggested: try to send your half-sister information about what is going on through a trustworthy person.

You can't just phrase things as a question and not understand that it changes the context and implications as compared to a statement. I understand what he did, I just think it was stupid. By phrasing it as a question you imply that is what OP wants.
