My stepmom and I aren\u2019t particularly close because she was already pregnant when I was introduced to her and after that she mostly focused on my brother. I neither like nor dislike her. She\u2019s just my dad\u2019s wife. My dad\u2019s family is wealthy so we never have issues with things like chores or money. I have 0 involvement with her side of the family.\n\nMy paternal family openly favors my brother because he\u2019s a boy. We are Asians. I was never quite neglected but ever since my brother was old enough to voice his desires, whenever my and his interests conflicted, he always got his way and I was fed the whole \u201cbig sister must give up her own wants and comforts for her younger brother\u201d spiel. I tried to distance myself from them and spent more time with my maternal family who\u2019ve had nothing to do with my dad\u2019s new family.\n\nI got into a university in the US and left when I was 18 and ever since was low contact with my dad\u2019s family. I\u2019m not big on social media and don\u2019t have a Facebook account and it works wonders on my mental health. When I was 22 I met my now fianc\u00e9 who was a med student at my university. He looked white, though after our first date I learned that his mom was from the same country as me. He showed me her picture, told me his parents divorced when he was 10, and his mom had since been remarried twice. They\u2019re not very close-she calls him twice a year on birthday and new year.\n\nI got a job in the same city after graduation while my fianc\u00e9 continued his med school. I met his dad a few times and he saw my maternal family through video calls. A few months ago he proposed and we recently headed back to my home country. He told me his mom\u2019s family would also meet us there. \n\nIt was then that we found out his mom is my stepmom\u2019s sister. They looked nothing alike, by the way.\n\nLong story short, my dad\u2019s family is wildly against us getting married, claiming that we\u2019re both related to my brother and it will be super awkward for him and everyone they know. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom and family (minus my stepmom) and my maternal family have no problem, thinking it\u2019s a funny coincidence more than anything. \n\nI told my dad\u2019s family that since we plan to live mostly in the US, they don\u2019t have to worry about us being awkward in my brother\u2019s life. My fianc\u00e9 and I insisted on the wedding and invited his and my maternal family and they told us they\u2019ll be there.\n\nLater, my dad called me, telling me I\u2019m not thinking of damages in the long run. He said he planned to send my brother to live with me so he can go to a US university, too, and I shouldn\u2019t be selfish and marry my step cousin. My fianc\u00e9 and I laughed about it, but I still wonder AITA?\n\nEdit: I already told my dad my brother won\u2019t be living with me during our call.
