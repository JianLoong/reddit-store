They had petty and sexist reasons to not give you either of their names when you were born, and now you have to compromise with them and be the mature one. Also, you are being asked to change your identity of the last 18 years. The name you have been issued your educational record in, etc. Do not complicate your life for these people.\n\nSide note: as someone who is into genealogy, it is pretty cool that you were given another family name from a previous generation. Crazy to see how many names are lost as we end up with just the one name that comes down from a single source of the father's line (in many western cultures).", "NTA. Fuck them. Neither of them wanted to share a name when you were younger, why should you do them that honor now? Your great grandmother gave you a gift- she showed up for you when neither of them did. That means something. Keep the name and remember fondly that she loved you very much", "NTA. Your parents are awful. Keep your name", "NTA The time when it is awkward for a child to have a different last name than the parents is \u2026 while they are a CHILD. Dealing with schools, doctor\u2019s office, etc. Asking you to change it as an adult is like closing the barn door after all the cows are out. What they are REALLY asking is \u201cprove I\u2019m your favorite parent by choosing MY name,\u201d which is all kinds of f\u2019ed up.", ">My mother says that it's ridiculous for a child to have a different last name than either of their parents<\n\nIt wasn't ridiculous for the last 18 years but now you're old enough for them to blame you for their mistake it's all of a sudden ridiculous?\n\nYou can't make this shit up.\n\nNTA and you DID have a special bond with your great-grandmother or she wouldn't have given you her name and loved you dearly.\n\nHow were your family not disgusted with your parents when they both decided you weren't worthy of their names.", "NTA - Your name, your choice. Period.", "NTA. They could have had it changed at any point during your childhood, why is it up to you to change it now? You like your name - keep it", "Terrible idea. Tell them each separately you\u2019re taking the others name. \n\nSee their reaction and it will show you their true character", "I came to highlight this exact quote!! \"It's so ridiculous to keep the name we chose for you!!!\"", "Right? They could have legally changed thier child's name for 18 years. They last their chance to have a say.", "Literally was about to say this", "I'll admit I giggled more than a bit over the idea of someone thinking this is \"ridiculous\" when they're the ones who filled out the birth certificate. The time to have that thought was 18 years ago, lady.", "If it's that important to the parents, they should change their own name to match.", "I think there may be some underlaying legal issues why they didn't change her name. Now that she is going to be eighteen she needs to rush to please mommy and daddy to make them seem happy in a one name family.", "They wanted to change it during their divorce but the judge said no.", "They are willing to pay for it.", "They wanted to during the divorce but the judge said no.", "These people should not be having more kids.", "Right? Even if it is \"ridiculous for a child to have a different last name than either of their parents,\" well.... at 18 OP's no longer a \"child\" so there, problem solved! \n\nNTA NTA NTA", "She\u2019s being rebellious because now she\u2019s offended her parents. It doesn\u2019t matter that she wasn\u2019t good enough for their names when she was born!", "Apparently it was. I don't really remember it but I also didn't pay attention either.", "This!  NTA.", "That's the line that really jumped out at me for being insane. \"It's ridiculous for a child to have a different name, so now that you're legally an adult go do what I tell you to do.\"", "Mom says it's ridiculous for a child to have a different last name?!     \n      \nWhere was she back when her daughter was born then?", "Seriously OP this \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb\nWTAF is wrong with your parents?", "They didn't do it because it would've cost them money; pretty much the only time you can do it for free is when you get married. Now they want OP to spend that money.", "That\u2019s the way it should be", "Methinks the parents are upset at having a constant reminder of their own petty behaviour from nearly 18 years ago. Dad doesn't want to be reminded of what a raging misogynist he was (and probably still is on some level) and Mum doesn't like to be reminded that she sulked like a toddler over the issue (\"why should I be the one to fix this, it's not fair\" etc).\n\nNow they're both playing \"pick me!\" with OP, so 18 years later neither of them has grown up over this issue. Like you say, they just want power over the other. One of them probably said \"I'm going to ask OP to change to my surname\" and the other immediately threw a hissy fit because it should be THEIR name that gets picked.\n\nChanging your name is a huge pain in the neck. I've still got a few documents in my maiden name as sending off my marriage certificate is such a faff. And that's another thing, if OP ends up in a committed relationship in the future then they may want to change their surname then anyway (including double barrelling, or combing the two surnames to make something unique), so double the effort for, frankly, sod all actual reward.", "Smells of some kind of legal issue in the backstory.", "It's expensive and harder to change a kid's name vs an adults. We were going to change my SD's name to match my husband and there's so many hoops to jump thru!", "ok but they should have given you one of their last names when you were born, it just seems like a messy situation and you should just tell them that its your choice", "Info: Are your parents on good or bad terms?", "Still, everything else is true.", "So a judge wouldn't get in the middle of their fight over which name you should take?  Ok, fair enough.\n\nSo both your parents decided to wait until you're 18 and you can decide for yourself.  And now that you're almost 18 they're both pressuring you to pick different names?  So they essentially just deferred the argument from the time of the divorce until now?\n\nSeems like a bunch of crap to me.  If they want to be at each other's throats or coming after you to pick sides, I think that not changing at all is really the best course of action.  Sounds like they are both acting very immaturely, and it doesn't seem right that either of them should \"win\".\n\nMore importantly, you like your name as it is.  That's really the only reason that matters.  I'd say tell both of your parents that you aren't changing it, and they just need to deal with that.", "There\u2019s a reason: judge probably didn\u2019t want to take sides. And you shouldn\u2019t have to do that now.\n\nAlso in the US at least , it really is a pain to have changed your name. Every school, job , apartment, bank account, credit card, you will have to provide double the paperwork instead of just a driver\u2019s license.  \n\nDo you want to have to explain why you changed your name for the rest of your life? Cause you will have to if you do this.", "Then they could have changed it then. Not your problem now! You do you!", "I don't think money is the issue, OP said they offered to pay. \n\nI really think it's just them trying to make OP \"pick sides\" post-divorce", "Now you have a name from someone who was proud to give it to you.", "If it was that important,  then they would have deemed those hoops worth going through back then. Seems like more of a petty thing between the parents now. No OPs problem.", "Bad. \n\nIt's calmed down now though.", "Then they are probably trying to use this as a way to hurt the other. Like who's name you choose is who you care for the most. Didn't they produce any other kids?", "My mom and her wife have a baby, but they hyphenated. My father doesn't have more kids, but they probably still could.", "Yeah, both bad parents are competing against each other without a care for the OP."]}
