For small dogs, though, it can be very dangerous, as they only need to ingest about one clove\u2019s worth or so.\n\nCats, however, are much, much more susceptible and have a much higher chance of serious complications or death due to how their bodies work and how small the ingested amount can be before that damage is caused.

I'll never forget hearing about a chinchilla who'd died after a guest fed them meat (they are herbivores) or the well-meaning 'rescue' team who killed a lot of the chins they were meant to be helping by giving them vegetables, a major bloat risk. Chinchillas are really delicate, what to feed them is more about what not to, and chinchillas who have been fed healthy food are only more sensitive. I definitely find people wanting to lump them in with other rodents like rats and mice (and then insisting on arguing about it) or thinking they're like a guinea pig or rabbit while also not realising how important it is to be careful about food with those animals too. I could swear some people process delicate exotic pets as some kind of challenge to prove they're not really that delicate and don't 'really' have the care needs they do, like the issue some have with cats, and with disabled humans (as I am disabled) even.\n\nEven my mum, who I would generally trust not to poison them on purpose, I once turned my back for five seconds and found her feeding my sick boy chinchilla a raw banana. At that point I was also prepared to mix sugary items like diluted apple juice to encourage him to eat, so I would otherwise have been drastically madder, but there I can control quantities, not just 'he looked interested' and assumptions I'm 'mean' and a certain stubborn idea that he must basically be a hamster.", "My cat likes to murder but not eat vegetables.
