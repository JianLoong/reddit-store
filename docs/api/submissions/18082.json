Not intentionally trying to poison it. \nHe's a dork for doing that for sure.", "He was told multiple times not to do it, had OP not noticed the cat could have died, her response was not at all overblown.", "So I googled it:\n\n>In most cases, a single clove of garlic is all it takes to poison a cat. Cats are more susceptible to garlic poisoning than dogs\n\nAbsolutely the cat should not be fed garlic. Full stop. \n\nHowever this was not a life & death emergency. There is no way the dose was high enough to kill a healthy cat.", "I perfectly understood that, throwing food in thrash is equally wrong. I am sorry but wasting food is never the right thing.", "Alliums are bad news for cats, man. It gets the chocolate treatment by a lot of people in that \"oh, a little bit won't kill them!\" but it absolutely can. And that's not a gamble anyone should be making tbh", "And dogs! So are onions", "I\u2019d have responded dramatically as well. Sudden, explosive, dramatic. I wasn\u2019t intending to say it was an overreaction, because i certainly don\u2019t feel it was", "Agree,  this Steve guy is being actively hostile and dangerous now.   Not sure why in the world the husband would want to be friends with a jerk like that.", "while i agree op is nta and had every right to throw away his food, that scenario is different lol. she said she threw the whole meal away, not just the garlic bread. i don't think the whole meal consists of garlic.", "NTA regardless, you don't give peoples pets any food or treats without the owners permission.", "This. She\u2019s reminded him so many times and if her cat got sick? I\u2019d be done. She gave plenty of warning maybe Steve should get his listening ears on when in someone else\u2019s house.", "Everyone in the story sucks. Steve for feeding the cat after OP asked him not to; husband for letting him feed the cat and continuing to invite him over.\n\nBut neither of them rose to the level of OP yelling at Steve and physically taking food away from him.", "My cats wouldn't eat something that was poison. They'd ignore it.", "She still can\u2019t take his food and throw it away. She can either tell him to leave or take her cat and put it somewhere.", "Then she owes for the cost of his meal. And if she wanted him to leave, she should have just told him to leave instead of stealing his food.", "i\u2019m not saying she over reacted, just that throwing out his food wasn\u2019t necessary and makes it seem more like she was being over dramatic. much more productive to just kick him out of the house all together", "I know and agree. She's an asshole for letting him come over in the first place. There is nothing she can do to keep her cat safe with him there.", "Nonsense. She did not have the right to trash that guy's dinner. She sounds like an angry drama queen. Her reaction was way over the top.", "But it could very easily have made the cat very ill. Or the cat could be unexpectedly unhealthy. Yeah, don't let people poison your pets. If they try, feel free to chuck the poison.", "Thank you doctor, glad for your Google expertise. Oh wait, you aren't a vet? Then wtf do you know?", "It could still have been enough to make the cat sick. I mean, if your child had a mild, non-lethal allergy to peanuts (let's say it makes them break out in hives), and you'd repeatedly told someone not to give them food if they're not sure what's in it, and you caught them giving your kid a random cookie, wouldn't you be upset.\n\nI don't like the fact that she threw away the whole meal, but I get the sense she was really fed up. Too much human food of any kind is terrible for cats.", "The people that say \"Oh a little bit won't matter\" when it comes to allergies or poisons are frustrating idiots.", "I disagree purely because certain foods are dangerous to and can kill animals, garlic can kill dogs (I'm not sure about cats) and he had been asked multiple times and still chose to ignore the warnings. She couldn't trust him to have food and not potentially kill her cat, so she got rid of the threat (the food). And the fact he hasn't come back, shows that it worked.", "OP's actions are the *worst* in the story? Yikes. I just value an animal's health more than a plate of food I guess", "YOUR cats. When I was 9 my cat stole a slice of garlic bread from the cabinet. Dead 3 days later. Garlic is toxic to them. It doesn't matter what your cats would do, when other cats have done it.", "yeah, no. cats will ingest plastic. they will ingest lilies and other poisonous houseplants. they will eat chicken bones out of the garbage. they will knock over the recycling can to try and ingest the styrofoam meat-soak pack incorrectly binned from the container of ground turkey used to make burgers forty minutes ago. (specific, huh? *ask me how i know*.)\n\ncats, much like dogs, will not always know what's bad for them. some of them think they have stomachs like garbage disposals. some of them don't think at all.\n\nwhich is all bad enough without some dipshit trying to share his Papa John's on purpose.", "Cats die all the time from eating potted Easter lilies that unknowing people bring into their houses.", " Not all cats would avoid it.", "Clearly some cats have eaten garlic, since we know it's toxic to them. Some cats have less of a survival instinct.\n\nLook, I hate food waste, but I can understand an exasperated knee-jerk reaction in this case.", "how is she the asshole when steve is the friend of her husband? the husband is the one enabling this and op just had to be the one to put their foot down because he wouldn\u2019t", "Says the drama queen saying that garlic isn't gonna kill the cat when garlic has killed thousands of cats, probably more. Including mine as a child.", "I say NTA and I'm not even on the side of thinking she had the god-given right to throw out his meal. More like...it was just a combo meal from a fast food place, he can easily just go get another one? Throwing out the food was inconsequential compared to the repeated disrespect.", "Its nonsense that you seem to only want to label the wife here as some kind of rage a holic after someone literally fed her cat something poisonous. He didnt know? Tough shit, hes been told not to feed it. Its not his pet. And if the husband is giving \"mixed signals\" then hes also an asshole for not talking to his buddy about it. She over reacted, but on the totem pole of assholes in this scenario shes definitely at the bottom.", "for real\n\nshe just had to tell him to leave, as viciously and loud as she wants but you don;t get to trash someone's possessions\n\nBet there's more than a few bad dry-wall patches in that house", "If I'm wrong, go find a better source and cite it.", "ESH covers the husband, as well. The only person blameless here to me is the cat.", "Her husband was right there and allowed it. If Steve is getting mixed messages, he probably goes by what his friend allows and ignores the hothead wife.", "The point is that he shouldn't have done it at all. OP overreacted by throwing his meal out, yeah, but it's not like my solution would have been any better (call the cops on him for trying to poison my animal multiple times)", "Your own source says it's highly poisonous. Point is, NO dose of posion is OK, no human food should be fed to the cat and he got numerous warnings. \n\nIs it OK until the cat dies? Wtf? How many licks equals a clove? Personally, I use an entire bulb of garlic when I make a loaf of garlic bread. Any bite may give you a whole clove. \n\nHow do you or Steve know the cat doesn't have undiagnosed kidney issues? \n\nCan I feed a baby just a teaspoon of bleach since it's unlikely to kill the baby?\n\nNTA and Steve shouldn't be allowed back in the home until he apologizes. He shouldn't be allowed to eat there ever again.", "Oh wow we're getting into the sexism early today."]}
