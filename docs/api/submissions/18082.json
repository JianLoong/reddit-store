For small dogs, though, it can be very dangerous, as they only need to ingest about one clove\u2019s worth or so.\n\nCats, however, are much, much more susceptible and have a much higher chance of serious complications or death due to how their bodies work and how small the ingested amount can be before that damage is caused.

Throwing things out that don't belong to you is childish. \n\nSteve is the asshole.  Op had a childish reaction.  \n\n\nThats all.", "Not necessarily. There is a difference between active malicious behaviour and simple dumbassery.\n\nIf my boss makes a cake with butter and I eat a piece, I am going to suffer some consequences. But my boss isn't trying to poison me, they just don't know that consuming a butter-laden item will have me diving to the nearest restroom at lightspeed.", ">Sometimes it's OK to do things like thet to get someone to leave or to stop people from poisoning your pets.\n\nI just merely pointed out that throwing out food is not right. I am not sure why I am being attacked for that.", "NTA. is steve a youngster? he could have poisoned your cat due to his inability to listen? that is entirely his fault, and he has been warned multiple times. If something had happened to the cat, this could have turned out much worse for him. I wouldn't allow Steve back into my home after this because your husband is also the AH for not holding Steve accountable and forcing you to do so.", "Yes, I believe it was all members of the allium species, but I\u2019m not sure if the flowers themselves are an issue.  Just that the \u201cbulbs\u201d (so to speak) like garlic, onions, leeks, scallions, shallots, etc, are certainly toxic, with garlic being more toxic than the rest (and the most common).\n\nFun fact, aloe is also toxic to cats and dogs\u2014or at least the outside layers of the plant are.  I discovered this when my dog ate part of my aloe plant.  She was fine, but it was very stressful.", "Absolutely, Steve is the worst. \n\nSo is the comment above mine's bil. Don't be mean to animals and respect the rules of the pet owner/ handler of non-pet animals.", "Emphasis on \"MADE UP\"", "We found the beta.", "*Balled up fist intensifies*", "A-A-R-D-V-A-R-K", "i know, im saying if its bad for a dog, its REALLY bad for a cat in cases like this.\n\nit really doesnt take much", "Pretty sure it's illegal to kill someones pet in their own home.", "No, the only childish people here are Steve and you. OP had every right to institute the natural consequence of removing the dangerous food before removing the dangerous person.", "Steve almost killed her cat. Who cares about his food? He can starve for all she cares.", "Because you're holding a plate of food above quick action to stop someone from harassing a cat.", "Lilies are also fatal if the pollen is ingested. I'll never forget the fear when our kitten shoved his face full on into a lily at the in-laws house and came out orange. Thankfully we grabbed him and washed it off before he could clean himself, but we were on high alert for ages just in case.", "Oh, gotcha!  Sorry, I\u2019ve got post-long weekend brain today, I swear.  Everything\u2019s processing at a snail\u2019s pace.", "Did you miss where I said esh. I have even went on further to say Steve was the main a hole here but she was asking if she was for throwing out his food and yea she get some a hole credit for that.", "I never blamed her reactions we all react differently but I just said throwing food is not a solution to any situation.\n\nI am not sure if this is a cultural thing but from where I come from food is considered important and must be respected and to be never wasted. I hope now my comment makes sense", "nah its cool lol gotta get the brain up and running again lol", "You all are acting like I said Steve was in the right. He was wrong. I have said that many time but she was also wrong, to a much smaller degree, for throwing out his food. If she had cooked it or bought it then she was not an a hole at all but that\u2019s not what the situation was.", "And I'm objecting to that because a lot of people believe that so hard they argue to respect the food, even when the food is part of the problem.  \n\n\nWhere I come from at least respecting food like that causes a lot of really unhealthy pathology.  \n\n\nI didn't mean to attack you just push back against the kind of thinking that gives us the \"clean plate\" club and people ignoring allergies."]}
