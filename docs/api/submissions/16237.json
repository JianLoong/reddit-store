It's usually really fun and a great way for the family to keep in touch and support each other (like sending someone having a bad week home with a bunch of great leftovers). There's only one rule: What you bring needs to be homemade. The explanation I got for this was always that one of my uncles has a peanut allergy so it's important that there not be peanuts in the food. Most of the family are great cooks so it's not an issue. If someone's not a great cook or is having a tough week, they bring in something like fruit and it's all good, we try to keep it low pressure.\n\nAnyhow, about a year ago I (29F) got a bread maker from a thrift store and absolutely love it. A lot of weeks I'll bring in a couple loaves of fresh bread along with something else (like homemade jam or fixings for sandwiches). On the rare occasion that anyone's asked me how I make the bread, I have not been shy about saying it came from my bread maker, but it honestly doesn't often come up in conversation.\n\nThis Sunday I brought in garlic-y bread (bread with garlic baked into it, not garlic bread like we think about it usually) that I made in the bread maker with fixings for BLTs. \n\nSo, I'm helping my cousin's (34M) kid (7M) put together a sandwich when his wife Betty (34F) (fake name) came up to chat with me. She said that her other kid (13M) really liked his sandwich and asked about the recipe. When I told her that I use a bread machine to make the sandwich she flipped, saying that I was a cheater and a faker, that the bread wasn't truly homemade, and that I should be ashamed of myself for leading everyone to believe that I was making bread from scratch for so long.\n\nFor a minute I thought she was joking and tried to laugh it off, saying that I was pretty sure she used an electric mixer for the whipped cream she made last week (which was delicious, just saying) and asked her if that counted as cheating, too. She said that wasn't the same thing, called me a witch, and took her kid away. Their family left a couple minutes later and I haven't heard from her since.\n\nI haven't talked about this with anyone in my family and I don't think she has, either, as I haven't heard from anyone. Most of my friends just kind of said WTF when I told them about it, but the fact that Betty is someone whose judgment I usually respect has me second-guessing whether or not I am the asshole for using the bread maker so often and \"cutting corners\", which is why I am coming here for judgment.", "created_utc": 1683054716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135xac2/aita_for_bringing_bread_made_with_a_bread_maker/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
