The fact that your dad also laughed is outrageous (I'm assuming you and your sister have the same dad but even if you don't, that's still gross). Your grandma also needs to step off with defending him because from my perspective, this is indefensible behaviour. \n\nAlso, while you're involved in this dispute with your family, please remember that, at 24, you are also an adult and can speak your mind whenever you choose, especially when you're standing up for someone who isn't in a position to stand up for themselves.

Everyone but you and your sister in your family have a warped way of looking at things.

I just don't have words for them.  The fact that their warped logic would entail you apologizing to someone merely for the reason that they are your elder makes no sense.  I can't think of something more ridiculous, to be honest.  An appropriate analogy would be if the uncle had punched you in the face in an attempt to mimic the antics of The Three Stooges, and when you reacted in horror and anger, as you should, everyone in your family says it was merely a joke and you owe your uncle an apology because he is older than you.\n\nApologies are not based on age, or in your family's case, one's level of stupidity.  They are based on the situation, event or person deserving of an apology.\n\nEveryone should be treating your sister with kindness and empathy.  There is absolutely NOTHING in her situation that warrants a response of a hurtful comment in gest.\n\nPLEASE show your family this response and every other one that will no doubt side with me, and please know that you have my admiration for standing up for your sister, and putting those idiotic, so-called \"adults\" who are completely devoid of empathy in their place.", "You think your uncle was an AH and not your father?
