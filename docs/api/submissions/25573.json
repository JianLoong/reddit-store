It's simply cruel. He says he didn't mean it \"that way\"--well, in what way did he mean it?\n\nYou called an AH an AH, and that' okay.", "NTA. What an incredibly insensitive thing to say to young woman who isn't going to be able to live out her whole life. Your uncle is TA and you were fully justified in what you said. Just because he is an adult in your family doesn't mean he gets a free pass to talk to people like this and as a \"joke\" this has got to be one of the least funny things I've ever heard. The fact that your dad also laughed is outrageous (I'm assuming you and your sister have the same dad but even if you don't, that's still gross). Your grandma also needs to step off with defending him because from my perspective, this is indefensible behaviour. \n\nAlso, while you're involved in this dispute with your family, please remember that, at 24, you are also an adult and can speak your mind whenever you choose, especially when you're standing up for someone who isn't in a position to stand up for themselves. I hope your sister is OK, and I hope the times ahead aren't too hard on you both.", "My first comment got removed because I called the uncle some not so nice names. You are NTA and if anyone says he was joking ask them \u201cwhat was the joke?\u201d", "Yes, absolutely, your sister deserves an apology.  Everyone but you and your sister in your family have a warped way of looking at things.  The uncle was in the wrong for saying such a tasteless, heartless, really repulsive thing, and it matters not that it was meant as a joke.  In fact, that makes it worse because \"who\" with two brain cells and an actual heart would make a joke of such a thing.\n\nYour father laughing at it makes my blood boil, as this is his own daughter that the uncle was referring to.\n\nYour grandmother and mother . . . I just don't have words for them.  The fact that their warped logic would entail you apologizing to someone merely for the reason that they are your elder makes no sense.  I can't think of something more ridiculous, to be honest.  An appropriate analogy would be if the uncle had punched you in the face in an attempt to mimic the antics of The Three Stooges, and when you reacted in horror and anger, as you should, everyone in your family says it was merely a joke and you owe your uncle an apology because he is older than you.\n\nApologies are not based on age, or in your family's case, one's level of stupidity.  They are based on the situation, event or person deserving of an apology.\n\nEveryone should be treating your sister with kindness and empathy.  There is absolutely NOTHING in her situation that warrants a response of a hurtful comment in gest.\n\nPLEASE show your family this response and every other one that will no doubt side with me, and please know that you have my admiration for standing up for your sister, and putting those idiotic, so-called \"adults\" who are completely devoid of empathy in their place.", "You think your uncle was an AH and not your father? Actually, I think your father was the bigger AH for not shutting down your uncle. This was his DAUGHTER!\n\nAnyway. no you're not the AH. Your uncle is. Your father certainly is.", "In no one\u2019s imagination could that be remotely funny.", "NTA, also the \"he is an adult\" comment as if OP isn't 24? Jokes are only funny if everyone is laughing. This is the opposite of funny, and everyone who laughed or excusing the uncle are major AH.", "You did not do anything wrong.  That makes you not the asshole.

It doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s an adult. The only way that should be relevant is to further prove how immature and cruel he behaved, and not as an adult should. It isn\u2019t his business whether or not she goes to college, and the fact that she started to list them means that she absolutely wants to. I respect the hell out of you and supporting her choices in life. Your sister definitely deserves an apology from him, and based on the responses, from the rest of the family as well. The only AH here is your uncle.", "NTA\u2014he\u2019s the asshole and you were accurate in saying so, the Internet has spoken", "NTA. DO NOT APOLOGIZE!!!! There was nothing funny about what he said and he is exactly what you called him. Tell him your sister doesn't appreciate what he said and would like an apology. You and your sister should refuse to have anything to do with him until he understands what he said was not funny and was not a joke. Best wishes for your sister's comfort and I'm sorry this is happening to both of you.", "NTA.\n\nA joke to you isn't a joke for everyone. \"To relax,  you where only joking\"", "I am so so sorry for you and your sister to be related with a bunch of unsensitive tools.\n\nI hope your sister will get into the university of her choice and she'll enjoy it to the max.\n\nNTA\n\nIt's great your sis at least has you to be there for her.", "NTA. What possible way could your uncle have meant that joke that would be acceptable? Ask your grandmother to explain that to you, and every time she tries to get around the question, saying, \"oh well, he just,\" repeat the question again; How is it funny that my sister will die before she can graduate college?

It was a joke at your sister's expense, and it sounds like no one but you stood up for her. \n\nI come from a culture where family will take the absolute piss out of you, even if it hurts, and laugh like hyenas. If this happens, you gotta laugh at yourself twice as hard or stand up for yourself. \n\nExcept in this case, if I were the uncle and read that the joke wasn't funny or distasteful, I'd swallow my pride and apologise sincerely. Instead, they expect an apology without accepting what was said was crossing a boundary which you established then and there. Good on you, you're a good sister.

Really gotta set the examples better, this isn't how leaders lead.", "NTA fuck your uncle.", "He was an A H. The butt of his joke wasn't laughing, so it was cruel and bullying, not humor.
