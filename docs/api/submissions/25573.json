The fact that your dad also laughed is outrageous (I'm assuming you and your sister have the same dad but even if you don't, that's still gross). Your grandma also needs to step off with defending him because from my perspective, this is indefensible behaviour. \n\nAlso, while you're involved in this dispute with your family, please remember that, at 24, you are also an adult and can speak your mind whenever you choose, especially when you're standing up for someone who isn't in a position to stand up for themselves.

I just don't have words for them.  The fact that their warped logic would entail you apologizing to someone merely for the reason that they are your elder makes no sense.  I can't think of something more ridiculous, to be honest.  An appropriate analogy would be if the uncle had punched you in the face in an attempt to mimic the antics of The Three Stooges, and when you reacted in horror and anger, as you should, everyone in your family says it was merely a joke and you owe your uncle an apology because he is older than you.\n\nApologies are not based on age, or in your family's case, one's level of stupidity.  They are based on the situation, event or person deserving of an apology.\n\nEveryone should be treating your sister with kindness and empathy.

Be specific.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s an adult\u201d\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re saying adults are allowed to be cruel?  What is the exact age where that type of behavior becomes acceptable?  Because I\u2019m 24, so I\u2019m an adult - why is his behavior acceptable while mine isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nYou are NTA - your uncle is an AH & anyone defending or excusing him are encroaching on AH territory.  If they are determined to pretend this behavior is okay, they should be able to explain why.", "NTA; age doesn\u2019t automatically demand respect. Good for you for standing up for your sister.", "YNTA.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say you and your sister are the only ones in this story who aren't AH!", "NTA.  Yes he is your uncle and an adult but you\u2019re an adult too?   That doesn\u2019t give him the right for an apology for something he was an AH for doing.  Sheesh.", "You're NTA. Uncle and father, however, are.", "NTA SO MUCH NTA. This is not even up for debate.", "NTA-  your uncle is an AH. How the hell else were you supposed to take what he says? Ask him to explain what\u2019s so funny about your sister dying? \n\nTell him you were only joking and he just didn\u2019t understand how you meant it. He should learn how to take a joke, it\u2019s not that serious. Not like he\u2019s dying.", "NTA. He is an adult? And wtf are you at 24?? He can F off.", "I'm sorry but the real red flag here is that your DAD was laughing. Like what in the actual fuck is happening here. What kind of family do you have that his terminally ill daughter is something to joke about. If someone said that about my kid they'd be six feet under. You were right to say what you did to your uncle. Actually, you could have said so much more than that. Your poor sister omg. I'm sorry she had to hear that.", "NTA, there's no way that was \"just a joke\" that was a terribly cruel thing for your uncle to say; saying \"it's just a joke\" is not a get out of jail free card. Honestly I probably would have called him much worse.", "nta and your uncle is disgusting", "NTA. Look Grandma in the eye and ask how it's funny that your sister is dying.", "He mocked his niece over her impending death, then ran and cried to Mommy when you slapped him down.  Tell him if he's thinking of doing stand up comedy, he shouldn't quit his day job.  NTA.", "NTA- Don't let your dad off the hook either bc he laughed too. Your sister deserves an apology from both of them.", "Some people use dark humor to cope, but that\u2019s up the the person who is actually terminal.", "I see it this way. If you are adult you are free to became asshole. Logic of OP's family", "Yep. I agree. Call him back and then cuss him out worse than the first time. Then tell mom, dad, and grandma what pathetic pieces of @:$/ they are for the way that they behaved.", "NTA. You are an adult too. Maybe you should ask your mother if she\u2019s developing dementia since she doesn\u2019t remember your age?\n\nMaybe ask Uncle to explain his \u201cjoke\u201d. Explain specifically what makes it funny.", "NTA with all due respect screw your family if they can\u2019t see that a dear loved one has less time to live and they joked about it I can\u2019t imagine how your parents are on his side if your sister made the joke maybe but from anyone else is disgusting and you have my deepest sympathy", "NTA. I'm sorry you and your family are going through that. The situation is cruel enough, your uncle didn't need to make it worse.", "NTA at all!!! \n\nI\u2019m speechless.", "You're 24. That's old enough to identify and call out assholes without getting scolded for it. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour uncle --- and your father --- thinks it's funny to joke about your sister's terminal illness?????\n\n\nAnd your family thinks that *you* should apologize???????\n\n\nI cannot even say on this sub what I think of your uncle, your father and your family.\n\nBut it starts with complete disgust and gets worse from there.", "NTA ask grandma to explain the joke. I have called my uncle a hell of lot worse then that. \nAnd tell your uncle you will appoligize when he pulls his head out of his ass.", "NTA and it\u2019s just horrifying to hear he joked about your sister dying, and people are defending him! NO, you don\u2019t defend the man who joked about your sister going to die soon so what\u2019s the point in paying for college! Your parents taught you right and wrong, and you are using it correctly. The fact that your mother said you should go along with what he said because he\u2019s an adult is fucking disgusting.", "I would've went to jail that day. You certainly handled it better than I would've. Not even close to being the AH", "You are not an AH.  Anyone who does not support you is one.  Shame on your father too.  kt", "All of you people are AHs for putting up with this disgusting pig who mocks a young woman facing her own mortality.\n\nHe didn't mean it that way? What way did he mean it, then?\n\nAnd there are your elders demanding you apologize--you, the only one who stood up to him.\n\nAnyone who doesn't go NC on him and his supporters is unforgiveable.", "NTA. Your uncle is evil and your family is cruel for telling you to apologize to him.", "Anyone who doesn't think your uncle was an asshole for saying that is probably an asshole. At least in this context.", "NTA to the millionth power. I am sorry about your sister\u2019s illness.", "NTA.   you had a right to call out your uncle for saying something that hurt your terminally ill sister.  It was an inappropriate comment that was not funny, but in fact insensitive and hurtful to your terminally ill sister.  \n\nDeath is not easy for anyone, and your Uncle and Father(who laughed) need to step up while they can and just apologize to both of you and refrain from expressing their grief and discomfort with her terminal illness by way of disturbing comments or jokes that hurt your terminally ill sister.  She is your sister and seeing her be hurt while battling a terminal disease, hurts you too and pisses you off, which will likely drive a life long wedge between you and your Uncle, Dad and Grandma as a result if it continues.  That is just the reality.  \n\nThey don\u2019t have to get therapy, but your Dad, Uncle and not surprisingly, your grandma need some grief counseling to provide them with some skills for coping and learning better communication skills for the duration of your sister\u2019s terminal illness.  The family needs help to get through this.  \n\nThey need to put her life experience ahead of their own personal discomfort with her impending death.  And they need to remember that their behavior is impacting your perception of them.   Their grief and sadness is expressing itself in a way that is hurting people and likely creating distance from your terminally ill sister and you from them.  and if it continues, it will likely put a permanent distance between you and them.  And that would be really sad, and compound hurt on top of more hurt.  \n\nI am so sorry. You are NTA.", "NTA- Hurting people you love is not a joke. Even if it's with words.", "NTA. I have worked as a CNA before and been around dying people. Having a sense of purpose and meaning to your life improves the quality of your life sometimes can even extend the length of a dying person's life. Give her all the love she deserves and continue to help her attend college. I know from experience that you won't regret it. She needs more people like you in her life.", "NTA-you should remind them that you are an adult as well.", "NTA.  Your parents should be furious with him too!", "NTA.  What \"other way\" did he mean it?  That's bullshit.", "NTA. Your Uncle is an adult and should have known better, same with your mother. Sounds like after your sister passes, you should just exit your family life, because it doesn't look healthy. Their loss, you're a compassionate person.", "It is amazing that you stood up for your sister. What he did was cruel!", "I had to put that so that they would accept it lol!", "Exactly my thoughts. If she was okay with it,\nI would be too.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Thank you", "she wants to go to college! her dream is to become a child life specialist. thanks for the concern \u2764\ufe0f", "She's living her short life with appreciation and bravery instead of giving up and not progressing as a human.", "she wants to go", "So your family is also full of people who put their idea of civility over actual decency; that sounds about right?", "I appreciate this so much!!! Much love! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "It does help when you read the whole sentence.", "Hang in there.  Try if if you can to give them a bit if grace, but encourage the family to seek some help.  Time is limited.  Hugs.", "Oh I did read the whole sentence, so I know what the yes absolutely was referring to(their sister being owed an apology)"]}
