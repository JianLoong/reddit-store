For anyone who walks in to be able to view you topless, I think that\u2019s bad business. Almost every studio I know has some sort of partition for people who don\u2019t want to be seen. \n\nNormally deposits are non refundable but as a woman for just anyone to be able to see your tits off the street, no fkn way.", "I\u2019m going NTA. The minute the artist new the tattoo was going to expose genitals, a private area should have be a for sure thing. The fact he denied you & then yelled at you about it, says he\u2019s an ass, too me. Honestly, I would leave a factual review about the experience; \u201cI paid a deposit for a sternum tattoo. When I arrived for my appointment, \u2018artist name\u2019 indicated I would be at a station where people walking by on the street would be able to see my exposed breasts as well as incoming clients. Despite repeated requests to move to a privater area, I was denied. The artist kept my deposit and told me if I wanted privacy I would have to reschedule with a new deposit. He was yelling at me so I left because I was very uncomfortable. I tried reaching out later once he had a chance to calm down and he will not respond.\u201d Done & done. If I read such I review, I would think long & hard about using such an artist.", "Naw fuck the YTA people. She was totally reasonable to not want to be exposed, and in her other comments, she mentioned the \"artist\" asked her not to wear anything to even cover up the nipples. The guy sounds unprofessional and stupid judging from her side of the story. And I'm saying this as a guy, if someone isn't comfortable with being exposed in the open, that's their right. I would have left the deposit with a credit card and charged back in her case.", "NTA. You are getting a private body part tattoed.  He needs to provide a private place to do that or give you your money back.   Just dispute the credit card charge.", "NTA. Fuck him, find a new tattoo artist. What sort of dick doesn't understand you don't want to be exposed in a public place. You should take him to small claims court to get your deposit back if he won't give it back.", "NTA. But I am not sure what your options are to recover the $80. I suspect it will be a huge fight to get it back and not worth the effort. I do think your boyfriend could have been more supportive though.", "NTA for not wanting to get tattooed. Also for wanting your deposit back. While artists can have deposits that are \u2018non refundable\u2019, if it comes with unspoken conditions then OP is within their right to want their money back. Getting tattooed in plain sight of strangers was not part of the original deal", "NTA. Having a tattoo in a spot like that shouldn\u2019t require you being on show to anyone who fancied a look. The artist was completely unprofessional not preparing adequately for your appointment and for putting you on the spot like that. You should have been given your deposit back IMO as you didn\u2019t want to cancel, you were forced to due to their actions. I\u2019d be surprised if you did get it back though, they don\u2019t seem to be able to see your side of this at all. I\u2019d be inclined to write it off, leave a review so that other women know what to expect and find a new artist.", "I'd say NTA. Getting the deposit back seems unlikely but I think in this case its at least ok to ask for it. Every tattoo shop should have some sort of privacy screen! He should have at least mentioned the lack of! I recommend finding a new artist, this dude sounds sketchy as hell for expecting you to be comfortable exposing yourself like that.", "NTA - Cost him way more than $80 in lost business and post one star reviews everywhere. He thinks it\u2019s tough to keep up with the bills now\u2026", "Nta", "NTA because he didn't try to accommodate you. It like you ask for a butterfly tattoo and he draws a moth and refuses to change it. You have every right to walk out and he should be giving your money back.", "Of course you're NTA! Christ, what's wrong with that dude. Drop him, tell his story on a review page", "Obviously it's customary that the deposit covers the artist's time if you don't end up getting the tattoo. You didn't get a tattoo, so technically the artist is within his rights to keep it.\n\nMorally, the artist set you up in an incredibly uncomfortable position and refused to accommodate a reasonable request in the slightest. Asking for the deposit back in that situation makes you NTA.\n\nWhen I got my sternum tattoo (right up between my boobs so no hope for bra coverage), my artist set me up in the corner so that other customers and artists were kinda separate from me, and a wall separated everyone from the reception desk and randoms on the street. He checked with the people who do the studios social media that they wouldn't be wandering back for \"in progress\" photos while I was there, so I wouldn't be in the background with my tits out. clarified he was going to be all up in my face and boobs while doing it and made sure I was comfortable. He offered tape to cover my nipples but in the end we decided to simply tape my button down shirt so it covered my chest but gave him access to where he needed to be. I'm fairly certain the tape came off at one point and he discreetly fixed it without being weird about it. My experience was good, I was happy, and I've gone back to that artist many times since. \n\nI don't think you were wrong to ask for the deposit back, and he is technically allowed to keep it (although it does make him an asshole in my opinion). If anything you've spent $80 to learn your artist is a jerk and that he's not someone you want to get tattoos from, an expensive and disappointing lesson for sure, but you're not in the wrong here.", "I\u2019m of two minds so INFO \n\nWhen you booked the appointment was it understood you would be in the back or just an assumption?  Or did you not know the way it was setup?", "Wow NTA.\n\nWhen I had to get my top off during my back piece, the tattoo artist had some non see through film to stick to my front, just incase I was not comfortable with being half naked the whole time.\nHeck he even offered to tape my bra in place if that is what I wanted.\nEventho we were at the back of the shop and the only ones who see me were other artist and clients.\n\nIt is very within your rights to not wanting to get tattooed in full view of everyone who might just walk in. You need to be comfy and feeling safe when sitting with someone that is basically scarring your body.", "Sounds like you need a new BF *and* a new tattoo artist.", "All the people commenting Y T As, it's understandable when you are getting something done to your privates that you will be covered and not exposed. \n\nIf the artist didn't have the accomodation, he should inform the customer before the appointment. \n\nI get a Brazilian and I expect that it will be done in privacy. If they do it in an area that's open to anyone, I'll just nope out of it. \n\nNTA\n\nOP, I donno if you could take him to small claims. But do give him a review everywhere you can and do mention what happened explicitly. Also, how he refused nip covers when they will not create any issue.", "NTA, if the artist doesn't want to give you your money back you could give a call to your bank", "as far as I\u2019m aware, deposits aren\u2019t taken back\u2014idk I may be wrong. you\u2019re not the AH for not wanting to get tattooed with your chest out, and your tattoo artist definitely should have been more accommodating, but couldn\u2019t this issue have been solved with some scheduling? ESH\u2014you for wanting your (non refundable) deposit back and him for his lack of accommodation", "ESH your deposit is non refundable either way and you chose not to go ahead with the tattoo. He\u2019s an asshole because a lot of people don\u2019t want to be exposed for all to see when getting tattoos, it\u2019s a bit inappropriate to expect clients to be happy being open for all to see.", "You are not the AH for not wanting the tattoo to be done in a more public area.  However, the purpose of a deposit is compensate the artist for lost time and income - he could have booked a paying customer into the time slot you cancelled on.  So YTA on wanting the deposit back.  Talk with him and perhaps you can reschedule for a time when a more private area is available.", "Sorry why do your breast need to be exposed for this tattoo? You can wear a sports bra or a tank pulled up. Even a bikini shirt. You could have done something so you did not have to be exposed like that.", "The deposit is like the fee to book an appointment. Regardless of whether you chose to go through with it or not, that's a time that they've reserved for you and therefore could not schedule any other customers in. That the deposit is non-refundable is standard practice.\n\nYou're fine to change your mind, but YTA for demanding the deposit.", "NTA. But just schedule for another day when he can guarantee you the back tattoo space. As he offered (though he should have warned you so as not to waste YOUR time). If you want him to do the art, the deposit is still his right?", "NAH;\n\nA tattoo shops featured artist typically tattoos in the most prominent area.\n\nYour deposit is typically non-refundable as it may have been used to draw your art and order necessary supplies for your tattooing. \n\nSeriously though, this issue could have been solved with a single roll of not see-through tape.", "YTA they take deposits because they've already spent time doing work research or even drawing your tattoo also he's still willing to do the tattoo. It's ridiculous to think that there is no way to do this tattoo without you being completely exposed. There are button-up t-shirts you can even put like medical or sports tape over your boobs so they're not out for everyone to see.
