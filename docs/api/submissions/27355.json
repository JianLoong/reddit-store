A few years ago for her birthday I bought her a pair of AirPod Pros since she needed new headphones. I've got a set and she borrowed them a lot, so I knew she'd use them. She loved them. She takes good care of her things but since then hers have started acting up/glitching, and also losing battery quickly. I know it frustrates her. Mine don't have these issues, but they're obviously not brand new as I've had them for a couple years.\n\nI have the opportunity to get a new pair for free through my job. I have no need of a new set but why pass up the opportunity? And since her birthday is right around the corner, I'm planning to give her my old set.\n\nI want to clarify that I am not planning on **only** giving her a pair of used headphones. I've got three or four other gifts, that I'm sure she will love. That being said I worry that she'll see me giving her my old pair as hand-me-downs or as me splurging on myself instead of on her. I wouldn't be surprised since I myself might feel a bit of resentment if someone bought themselves a new item and gifted me the old one. I don't want to pass on the opportunity to get a new pair for free, and I also don't want to toss out my current pair, and I'm sure it sounds selfish but I want a new pair for myself, not get a new pair and give it away.\n\nSo I guess my question is, would it make me the asshole if I gave her my current (used) pair while keeping the new pair for myself?", "created_utc": 1695341457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ovuaz/wibta_if_i_gave_my_wife_my_used_airpods_for_her/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
