A few years ago for her birthday I bought her a pair of AirPod Pros since she needed new headphones. I've got a set and she borrowed them a lot, so I knew she'd use them. She loved them. She takes good care of her things but since then hers have started acting up/glitching, and also losing battery quickly. I know it frustrates her. Mine don't have these issues, but they're obviously not brand new as I've had them for a couple years.\n\nI have the opportunity to get a new pair for free through my job. I have no need of a new set but why pass up the opportunity? And since her birthday is right around the corner, I'm planning to give her my old set.\n\nI want to clarify that I am not planning on **only** giving her a pair of used headphones. I've got three or four other gifts, that I'm sure she will love. That being said I worry that she'll see me giving her my old pair as hand-me-downs or as me splurging on myself instead of on her. I wouldn't be surprised since I myself might feel a bit of resentment if someone bought themselves a new item and gifted me the old one. I don't want to pass on the opportunity to get a new pair for free, and I also don't want to toss out my current pair, and I'm sure it sounds selfish but I want a new pair for myself, not get a new pair and give it away.\n\nSo I guess my question is, would it make me the asshole if I gave her my current (used) pair while keeping the new pair for myself?", "created_utc": 1695341457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ovuaz/wibta_if_i_gave_my_wife_my_used_airpods_for_her/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just want to know if it would make me the asshole if I also gave her the old pair. Thank you for your input.", "Okay but let\u2019s pretend for a sec that he did give her the new ones. Then people like you would probably be saying it\u2019s tacky for him to be regifting something he got for free instead of actually spending something on a separate gift for her.", "Exactly.\n\nPlease don't do this.\n\nYou already know that it's not ok\n\n\nYWBTA", "This right here.  OP is very selfish.", "That\u2019s the key right there, passing on ear buds used for years is kind of nasty. I assume some cleaning is possible but still.  Making it part of the Bday is doubling down on the sketchiness.", "Since when are women\u2019s birthdays afterthoughts? Do you have stats to back up your claims?", "Or just give the old ones but NOT as part of a birthday present. Or just buy her a NEW pair?", "Plus it's like...can you even change out the parts that go in your ears on AirPods?

But, since yours work fine, why not give your wife the new ones since hers are not working well?", "My overriding emotion reading this is \u201cThank God my husband is nothing like you\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s her 40th birthday- classically an important birthday for most people\u2026 and you want to give her a hand me down gift so you can have shiny new ones AND not spend that kind of money. Because \u2026 fuck her I guess. \n\nI mean, I hope you at least have the decency to not respond to her with how ungrateful she is when she\u2019s upset about your trash idea of a 40th birthday gift. YTA.", "Why not give her the new ones YTA. Do you even like your wife?", "Just give her your old headphones separate from her birthday.", "I appreciate that you took the constructive criticism and are doing what seems to be the best option. Well done and good for you. I say NTA for asking and taking the sound advice when it's presented.", "You already have gift for her. So don't give your old headphones as a gift. Just gave them to her and explain that you get a new one and instead of throwing an old one you're just wanted to ask her if she want them. Don't call it a birthday gift. \nAnd ask her this after her birthday.", "Mods have noted that this is not true quite often. If there are two judgments a mod reviews and determines it.", "Yes it sounded like you had done less with the other presents because of the AirPods, it sounded like they were small. It\u2019s her 40th, make it a big deal.", "Used old headphones\u2026.not a great gift.  Especially when you start wearing brand new ones instead.", "If you say it is part of her birthday present then YTA. If you say \u201chey, I got new AirPods for free through work. I know your are acting up so would you like my old ones?\u201d then NTA. Don\u2019t relate it to her birthday.", "Yta and don\u2019t have a conversation with her about it because that just sounds like your going to guilt her into saying yes. Either buy her new ones or just give her the other gifts. Giving her something used because you kept the new ones would just make her feel unappreciated", "Yes, you would be.

He cares more about himself", "Did you not read the part where he\u2019s getting her like four other things?? Just because he himself receives something nice once in a while doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s obligated to give it away first chance he gets. \n\nAnd my other over riding emotion is let\u2019s say he were to give her the pair he\u2019s getting for free. Then people would probably be up in arms about how he\u2019d still be a cheap skate by just re-gifting something.", "He's NTA for wanting to splurge on himself.

Thanks", "Do you realize that every guy or majority aren\u2019t the caricature of shit guys women date?", "Yeah\u2026 you do realize that in some cultures birthdays are celebrated, right?

Also doubt work will require him to use a specific apple product if he doesn\u2019t work with apple or partnered with then in any way.", "In some cultures, people are raised to care about others and celebrate others. So birthday become big gathering of family and celebration of life of that person. Not everyone in a typical American guy raised to care about themselves. Think every guy is like that is stupid.", "It\u2019s not even about fighting.

But I\u2019m also fairly positive if the question were \u201cAITA for regifting my wife a pair of headphones I got for free?\u201d or something, plenty of people would still be up in arms about it and still accuse him of not putting thought into it.", "What makes you think I am referring only to American men? I\u2019m not American and neither are the majority of the women in the world and yet if you go out and ask, you will find every woman shares this experience.

It\u2019s a bullshit response and shows your immaturity. Additionally, I wasn\u2019t even going to just say American I was going to go into western culture, but yeah\u2026"]}
