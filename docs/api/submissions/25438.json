The other people don\u2019t know the dog is nice and friendly. That was stupid of her.\n\nYou however, OP, definitely overreacted. There were a thousand better ways to react and handle this situation. When was the last time calling someone \u201cfucking stupid\u201d helped?? Never. That\u2019s when.

Golden Retrievers are known for the temperament and gentle/playful nature, yet still she should have considered your thoughts first.\n\nStill, you were out of line in how you responded to the situation. You are a young parent, I\u2019ve been there, and I know it\u2019s scary. You can\u2019t let the outside world turn you into a bitter asshole. Your son is going to come across a lot worse than a Golden Retriever, save your energy for the real issues.\n\nEdit: I must have missed that line where you threatened the safety of her and her dog.

If you don\u2019t like it, go elsewhere.", "ESH.\n\nOne, obviously this was a rookie dog owner move. There should have been communication with you, the parent, about whether it was okay to have her dog approach your son. Instead of making assumptions. It was rude and definitely AH behavior. You were right to ask her to curb the dog, move along, or have a leashed interaction w/ your son if you permitted it.\n\nBut you escalated things dramatically by calling her \"fucking stupid.\" It was a dumb judgement call, but one that was not malicious or harmful in its intent. Also, did you actually, um, threaten her/the dog (\"she's lucky all I did was grab its collar?\") Also, why are you touching someone else's dog? Why not, you know, pick up your kid versus touch \"the strange dog\" in a way that actually might provoke a negative response in the dog? Because, you know, a strange human grabbing a dog's collar/neck is an aggressive response.\n\nHonestly the level of vitriol here makes you seem really unsettled OP. I'm assuming you've had a very negative interaction with an unleashed dog, because otherwise you acted pretty unhinged.", "I understand the sentiment, but you could've been alot less abrasive", "~~E S H~~\n\nShe absolutely should not have even approached you without permission, but you way over-reacted and could have potentially made the situation even worse if that dog actually *was* aggressive.\n\nLow-key threatening the dog was just... unnecessary.\n\nEdit: changing my verdict because OP mentioned that this particular park does not require that dogs be leashed. Still don't think the owner should have done this but I definitely think OP is the one at fault here for their borderline unhinged reaction.", "YTA.

I do not support off leash in any places in public not even the dog park. Leashes keep the dog safe and everyone else safe. Definitely a lot of unnecessary injuries and deaths. If someone grabbed my dog by the collar and asked if I was fucking stupid, I might have an episode. You\u2019re just as \u201cfucking stupid\u201d as taking a dog off a leash with kids around. Maybe a little more. I wouldn\u2019t be touching peoples animals without permission but you can pick up your son and ask for them to put their dog back on the leash or leave. Its a public park so you have no authority over what other people do just what you do, like most things in life. It\u2019s wild that people walk around talking to strangers like that. You weren\u2019t supposed to know if the dog was aggressive or not because it\u2019s not your dog or your problem. You\u2019re lucky she was a stable person or you would have two unstable people in a conflict. Who knows what your son could have subjected to over a dog.

Even a non aggressive dog will bite someone who suddenly grabs it.\n\nIt sounds like you might have had a traumatic experience in the past (although I still don\u2019t understand why you would have grabbed the dog in that case), but a huge overreaction to the situation", "YTA don't bring your kid to the off leash park if you're so scared of a damn golden retriever", "Ok this is kind of on you then... why are you bringing your kid to a park where dogs can be unleashed and then losing your mind when there's an unleashed dog? Still think what she did was dumb, but I don't think you were acting much better.", "That's one of those facts that changes the whole story. \n\n\"It was profiling, as it turns out they were arresting everyone who drove down that particular sidewalk.\"", "Oh. I missed that. Well that makes OP the asshole.", "The sentiment isn't wrong, but the execution is. You GRAB YOUR KID in this situation, not the \"strange dog\" -- especially by the collar, which could easily provoke even a calm dog into a fear/aggression response.\n\n\"Defending your kid at all costs\"... by literally going for the strange dog, not your kid? Makes no sense.", "First issue with that is that the dog was absolutely doing nothing aggressive (as far the info OP gave us says), it doesn\u2019t even say how close the dog got? Secondly randomly grabbing a dog is pretty much the worst idea, I would understand if a dog had bitten the child or had grabbed onto the child, you would of course try and pull it away. But suddenly grabbing and yanking the collar of a strange dog, that has just walked nearby, especially when you think it is aggressive is unbearably dumb. I mean they literally even left their child alone to storm back over to the owner with the strange dog. You want to protect your child in that situation? Pick the child up, put yourself between the child and the dog and request the owner puts the dog on a leash.", "Thanks!", "Thank you!", "oof. It IS an issue. Dog's off the leash are always an issue in a public place UNLESS its specifically a dog park. The difference is, in a dog park, every person who enters agrees to assume the risk of being in the company of unleashed dogs. In just a random park, folks should have confidence that any dogs will be leashed and managed by the people holding the leash. \n\nYour town needs leash laws IMO and I'm surprised they don't actually have them.", "Seriously, it irritates me to no end when posters do that", "don't worry, i didn't see it either until i started scrolling their comments. they conveniently left that bit out of the OP.", "Grabbing the kid could also make the dog think you\u2019re playing a fun keep away game with it.\n\nI learned this lesson the hard way when I picked up my dog to try and keep her safe while a loose dog was on the street. The other dog thought I was playing with it and grabbed my dog out of my arms. Its owners probably dangled a plushie above her for her to grab with her teeth, like many dog owners do, so this was a trained response I didn\u2019t predict. \n\nThe fact that it wasn\u2019t trying to be purposefully aggressive at least made it easy to get my dog out of its teeth, but my dog had to go to the hospital because I inadvertently provoked a play response in a strange dog.", "In a fight or flight reaction people do all sorts of things. I guess when a dog runs up to your kid you can do whatever you want and op can too", "I don\u2019t live in America, I am British. Pretty much no where in Britain or most of EUROPE has leash laws, it\u2019s primarily an American things. So no it\u2019s not actually an issue, it\u2019s actually far more common than you realise", "I was curious why there weren\u2019t leash laws in Britain and googled it and found this:\n\nThere is no blanket law requiring dogs to be kept on a lead in all public spaces. However, there are a series of orders that mean you have to leash your dog in certain places in your local area, for example children's play areas, sports pitches, roads, parks and beaches. (https://www.bluecross.org.uk/advice/dog/wellbeing-and-care/dog-laws-uk?amp)\n\nWhich is pretty sensible to me. Do you live in a part of Britain that doesn\u2019t even have these orders?", "Common or not. It makes me uncomfortable. I wouldn't want to encounter random wandering dogs.", "That\u2019s wild, I can\u2019t imagine it being legal to let a large dog run around off leash near small kids. Y\u2019all need to do something about that!\n\nI gotta say, leash law or not, if a random dog was coming at my 2 year old I would react similarly to OP. You don\u2019t know the dogs temperament and a parents first priority should always be their kids safety", "So some parts of Britain (remember Britain is made up of 4 different countries with different political systems, languages and laws) have councils (I\u2019m not sure what the equivalent in the US would be but think of like a town having it\u2019s own people in charge-but their not properly in charge if that makes sense). So some of those councils have these orders (which means their not laws) to say that they pretty much request the constituents to do that.\n\nTbh the majority of people in Britain would leash their dogs in a play park, we\u2019re just polite like that. And I think there should be laws that if your walking next to a road you leash your dog (that\u2019s mainly for the dogs safety). There are also sort of laws around dogs being leashed around livestock in Britain, because we (In Scotland) have something called Right to Roam, which means you can pretty much walk anywhere in Scotland, even private land.", "Their not random nor wondering? Their with someone, it\u2019s just not legally required to leash them", "We actually don\u2019t really need to do anything about it, dog attack\u2019s are few and far between and the majority happen at home. We have very strict laws about the breeds of dogs and we have a far better culture of training and caring for dogs than Americans do. It helps that we have banned prong collars, general fear based dog training, ear cropping, tail docking and have high levels of welfare.\n\nThis is not the smart thing to do in this situation. If you believe a dog is aggressive, do not suddenly grab it, pick your child up, and ask the owner to put the dog in the lead", "I get the instinctive being unhappy / not wanting an interaction between a toddler and a large dog. Less about bites and more about:\n\n1) large dog is boisterous and knocks kid down\n\n2) wanting to reinforce a boundary/lesson for the kid to make sure there is always a positive interaction with dogs (lest another dog be unfriendly)\n\nThe ironic thing is that while the lady letting the dog off leash was not a smart move, OP's behavior actually dramatically escalated the possibility of a negative interaction."]}
