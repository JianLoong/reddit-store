We just recently moved in together.  Several years ago (before I met her), my gf was very obese.  I've seen pictures of her and she doesn't even look like the same person.  She had gastric sleeve surgery, lost all of the weight and had cosmetic surgery to remove excess skin and such.  So, she keeps a very strict keto diet while at home and exercises 5 days a week.  Because she is very strict about her diet, when we do go out or have people over, she will sometimes have something not on her diet that just looks tasty to her at that moment.\n\nNow, my family doesn't necessarily diet, but we do eat fairly healthy.  We all exercise regularly.  My sister (22F) may be considered to be a little chunky, but I do not think she is heavy in any way.  I guess you could say that she caries whatever weight she has well.  I've also never gotten any impressions that my sister was self conscious in any way. (Which of course doesn't mean that she *isn't* self conscious)\n\nBecause of distance and timing, my gf had not met my family in person, but we have all video chatted many times.  Finally, my gf and I were able to go visit my family for Thanksgiving.  Because it was a holiday, at dinners my gf would go ahead and eat whatever even if it was not on her diet.  She would counter it by having maybe only one or two hardboiled eggs for breakfast and stuff.  And she was running every day.  I noticed that at dinners, my sister would make snide comments about my gf being able to eat whatever she wanted and not gain weight.  How she was lucky and should appreciate that her body allowed that.  And this was not jokingly, there was a definite undertone of snarkiness.  And this went on multiple times during each dinner and during multiple dinners.  My gf would try to laugh it off but I could tell it was starting to bother her.  So, after dinner on Saturday, my sister was washing dishes by herself, I went in and started helping her and told her that I've been noticing her comments and that I found them rude and she should stop commenting on my gf's body because she has no idea what my gf's day to day diet is and no idea what she's been through to have her body how she likes it. (My family doesn't know about her surgery because it's not my business to tell them).  My sister immediately got mad and said that I have no idea what it's like to have to sit across from someone with as perfect a body as my gf and I should just shut up.  She avoided me and my gf for the rest of our visit.  AITA?\n\nEdit:  I didn't mention that I did tell my gf after the fact.  She said that she appreciated me standing up for her because the comments were starting to bother her.  She didn't want to say anything since she was just meeting my family.", "created_utc": 1669642139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6wlsn/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_she_was_being_rude/", "score": 571, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I were you, I would have a few words about with sister about how hard GF works to keep that shape, with diet and exercise. I would then inform her that if she can't be polite, she needs be quiet because you aren't going to tolerate her rudeness. I spent years getting crap about how I could eat anything and not gain weight. I shut it down myself by telling people that if they would just get crippling depression and anorexia, they could starve themselves to a near fatal body weight... and maintain that for 2 years... so they too could kill off all their useful gut bacteria enabling them to eat anything and gain no nutrition from it the same way I did. It took me a while to find out that being brutally honest about how you are able to get and keep that super skinny figure, they realize pretty quickly that need to shut up.", "NTA - No one should be commenting on anyone else's body type. Good for you for standing up for your girlfriend.

If I was rude to every person with a better body than me Id be a fucking bit\\*\\* all the time! lol. I will suggest that your sister should maybe see someone about her obvious body issues.

Youre a good boyfriend and brother to stick up for your gf and to confront your sister in a private moment and not embarrass her in front of everyone.", "NTA - you talked privately to a family member about behavior that was out of line in a way designed to address the problem, defend your gf, and no humiliate your sister. It sounds like your sister has a lot of insecurities that she needs to work on but that doesn't give her the right to take it out on your gf.", "NTA. \n\nI bet your sister would start WW3 if someone commented on her figure and calling it body shaming.

Even IF she had a perfect metabolism, it's not grounds for the sister body shaming or insulting her.\n\nYour sister needs to address her OWN insecurities.", "NTA - But I feel like all of this could have been avoided if you GF would have simply said something like \" Girl, I can't eat just anything I want. I have a very strict diet and I run 5 days a week to keep my body this way.\" She didn't have to say the surgery part or get snippy to your sister while still letting her know that she works hard to keep her body the way she wants it.", "NTA you sound like a great guy, not telling your sister about your gf's weight struggles... But try to remember your sister is only going off of what she sees, and some people really are lucky enough to eat whatever they want. My brother was one of them, where as I gain 5 lbs smelling the bread. Perhaps your gf could talk to your sister? Could she share the diet and exercise she foIlows with your sister that allows her to eat like that on special occasions?

Your sister is very inconsiderate of your gf. Everyone has things they are dealing with. Hopefully, your sister can see that this is a way she could bond with your gf, instead of being mean. Her attitude is harmful to herself and your gf. Perhaps you should all work out together or something. It's not fair for your gf to be treated that way. It's good for you to stop it before it gets worse.", "Yes to this. If the sister has an issue with someone\u2019s presence being there, that\u2019s her own problem, what does she expect the gf to do?

Your sister obviously is a lot more self-conscious about her weight than you thought. But making snippy comments to a slimmer person isn't the way to handle it, and just comes over as bitter. Even if your girlfriend hadn't had weight issues and surgery, it still wasn't appropriate.\n\nI struggle with my weight and fight really hard to keep it down. I have friends who are just effortlessly naturally slim. I never feel resentful of them for it. Their naturally slim figures aren't a personal attack on me!\n\nYour sister is projecting what is obviously an inner shame at her weight onto your girlfriend. I am sorry for your sister because I know how bad it hurts to hate your own body. But lashing out at your girlfriend just isn't fair.", "Nta. You did it privately whilst respecting your gfs privacy. Maybe you can have a discussion with your gf about talking to your sister privately about her past with weight and what she does to maintain how she looks now.\n\nI think it could be a positive influence on your sister whilst creating a good relationship between the two of them. Your gf could be a positive influence that your sister needs.\n\nEdit: obviously if your gf doesn't like that idea that's OK as well. I'm not super chirpy about how I used to be 150kgs and am very self conscious about that period of my life. However I am a lot more open about it if people ask. I have a coworker who is very overweight and in a discussion I told him about how I used to be and now he asks me for advice on certain things and works out occasionally with me (he has lost 10 kgs thus far am v proud of him).\n\n(For any one interested, I did keto, calorie counting and being in a 15% deficit,intimittent fasting and worked out 4 days a week). I lost that weight within 14 months. \n\nI do exercise regularly, however I don't do the other stuff anymore.\n\nI go back to keto whenever I gained 10 kgs and usually after holiday periods to maintain weight as I find keto easier to do in bursts now then to maintain it all year around now I'm at a good weight. Even when I'm off keto I still keep low carbs, just not as intense as when I am on it.", "NTA - way to go for standing up for your gf against your family while still keeping your gf's surgery a secret. It goes a long way to building trust in a relationship.", "NTA\n\nYou did exactly the right thing. Commenting on someone else's body or eating habits is *extremely* rude (especially in this manner), and it's your job to ensure your family treats your SO with respect. Your sister needs to deal with her insecurities herself, not by blaming your girlfriend's existence for her feelings.", "NTA- if/when your sister eventually finds out how hard your gf has had to work, she will have learned a valuable lesson about never really knowing what someone else is going through. You sound like a lively boyfriend and a kind brother.", "NTA. Your sister is a brat though. As an overweight lady, I would never think to judge a thinner person and put them down. As I know what it's like to be judged based on my looks, I would NEVER do that to another. No one has any right to pass judgement on anyone elses body type and the sooner people realize this the better.

Well Handled.", "NTA Your sister needs to stop projecting her issues onto others and get over herself", "NTA.

And good for you for not telling about the surgery your GF had, but you could have said look, she used to be a big girl but with diet and exercise she's gotten the body she wants and deserves, so knock it off with the remarks.", "People aren't owed someone else's trauma as an explanation for why they shouldn't be rude. There is literally no universe in which it is okay to meet someone and then spend days commenting on their body.

If she won't even offer a half hearted apology, OP would be TA if he suggested gf spend any more time than absolutely necessary in her presence imo.", "NTA. Your sister needs therapy if she thinks it's appropriate to be that jealous and tear into someone repeatedly at meal times. Does she want to give someone an eating disorder because she's unhappy with her own body? She could have asked for tips on exercising as obviously your gf was still active everyday instead of just being rude af.

That's why I told my gf about what I said to my sister, so that my gf can decide what to tell her, or if to tell her anything at all.", "The problem is that people can still misconstrue what \"working hard\" means and continue to spin how GF is lucky. I am obese but I run and people say that I'm \"Lucky\" I can run and how they can't. I work really hard to run and I have arthritis, obesity and heart issues. \n\nThe truth is, it's none of sister's business and she shouldn't be commenting like that.", "NTA. I actually think it's incredibly considerate that you talked to her in private and didn't overstep telling your gf's business.", "NTA.  Your sister is a grownup and needs to learn to keep snarky comments about other people to herself.", "NTA\n\nbut also you should invite your sister over some time and let her experience your GF's day to day diet, and then explain exactly how your GF got the body she has", "NTA I\u2019m sure your GF was still trying to have fun while exercising regularly and staying on a strict diet just for it to be ruined by your sister . Also it was smart not to talk about it in front of whole family and to do it in private", "NTA. You're sister is a prick. Seriously, a bully. This type of toxicity should be avoided.", "NTA..... GF should be the 1 to disclose her personal experiences.  Little sister needs time-out!", "If your sister ever does it again, I think you need to be less private about responding, and tell her \u2013 in the moment, as soon as you can get a word in \u2013 that you have already spoken to her about this behavior and she needs to stop making those comments. Remember, your sister has shown no reluctance to attack and try to embarrass your gf in front of your family; if she is willing to indulge her most unkind inclinations in public, she no longer deserves to be confronted only in private.", "I agree with your approach 100%!   Maybe you should point out how your girlfriend limits her food and runs which is impressive as heck.  My little sister had the medical procedure but ate right through it and is back to her original weight so it isn\u2019t a \u201ccure\u201d but more of a helping hand kind of thing.  Kudos to you both for supporting each other!", "NTA.", "Sit down with your gf and ask her if she is fine with this, but my idea would be to ask if she was willing to send your sister a picture of her from a few years ago. Text it to her and just simply say \"I don't ever want to hear you speak about my gf's weight again.\" That should be a super shock to her & shut her up. If it doesn't, then she definitely needs therapy. Yes I know, it is none of your sister's business and your girlfriend absolutely doesn't need to do it, but at least you don't have to mention anything about the surgery and it would actually be a testament to how hard it was for her to get there. EDIT: I know that if the sister is an actual bully this may backfire and she starts making fat jokes. I am hoping deep down she is ignorant and not a complete mean spirited person.", "NTA", "I wouldn't suggest this OP because if she's being this snide about your gfs body she's going to mock her for taking what, in her mind, is the \"easy way out\" by using surgery to lose weight. She's going to call her names and make snide comments that are probably going to he worse. Do not have your gf open up to her."]}
