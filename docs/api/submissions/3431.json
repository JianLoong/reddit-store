{"id": 3431, "submission_id": "z6wlsn", "title": "AITA for telling my sister that she was being rude?", "selftext": "My (34M) gf (33F) and I have been together for a little over a year.  We just recently moved in together.  Several years ago (before I met her), my gf was very obese.  I've seen pictures of her and she doesn't even look like the same person.  She had gastric sleeve surgery, lost all of the weight and had cosmetic surgery to remove excess skin and such.  So, she keeps a very strict keto diet while at home and exercises 5 days a week.  Because she is very strict about her diet, when we do go out or have people over, she will sometimes have something not on her diet that just looks tasty to her at that moment.\n\nNow, my family doesn't necessarily diet, but we do eat fairly healthy.  We all exercise regularly.  My sister (22F) may be considered to be a little chunky, but I do not think she is heavy in any way.  I guess you could say that she caries whatever weight she has well.  I've also never gotten any impressions that my sister was self conscious in any way. (Which of course doesn't mean that she *isn't* self conscious)\n\nBecause of distance and timing, my gf had not met my family in person, but we have all video chatted many times.  Finally, my gf and I were able to go visit my family for Thanksgiving.  Because it was a holiday, at dinners my gf would go ahead and eat whatever even if it was not on her diet.  She would counter it by having maybe only one or two hardboiled eggs for breakfast and stuff.  And she was running every day.  I noticed that at dinners, my sister would make snide comments about my gf being able to eat whatever she wanted and not gain weight.  How she was lucky and should appreciate that her body allowed that.  And this was not jokingly, there was a definite undertone of snarkiness.  And this went on multiple times during each dinner and during multiple dinners.  My gf would try to laugh it off but I could tell it was starting to bother her.  So, after dinner on Saturday, my sister was washing dishes by herself, I went in and started helping her and told her that I've been noticing her comments and that I found them rude and she should stop commenting on my gf's body because she has no idea what my gf's day to day diet is and no idea what she's been through to have her body how she likes it. (My family doesn't know about her surgery because it's not my business to tell them).  My sister immediately got mad and said that I have no idea what it's like to have to sit across from someone with as perfect a body as my gf and I should just shut up.  She avoided me and my gf for the rest of our visit.  AITA?\n\nEdit:  I didn't mention that I did tell my gf after the fact.  She said that she appreciated me standing up for her because the comments were starting to bother her.  She didn't want to say anything since she was just meeting my family.", "created_utc": 1669642139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6wlsn/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_she_was_being_rude/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to deal with them and stop projecting her shit on other people.", "NTA.  Your sister is rude and insecure. No matter how frustrated we may feel about our own bodies we don\u2019t have the right to take that frustration out on others.  Making other people feel bad just because we feel bad about ourselves is a terrible thing to do.", "NTA.  Your sister is acting as though only her experiences and history count.  Rude, inconsiderate, self-centered, and a-hole-ish behavior on her part.", "NTA you dealt with it appropriately, not blowing it up, but letting her know in a setting where she doesnt have to lose face in front of everybody.", "NTA, your girlfriend is a guest in your home and you sisters behaviour was shocking. She doesn\u2019t get to bully a guest because she\u2019s unhappy with herself.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s good that you defend your girlfriend, and I hope your sister can get over her insecurities. There\u2018s literally no need to put someone down or be \"jealous\".", "NTA \n\nI don't think you are the asshole you asked her in private, if she has self image issues you really can't do much about it, she has to put in the work, physical or mental whichever works for her.", "NTA  the fact that you talked to your sister in private spoke calmly to her about how you thought it was making your GF feel are very commendable, if the shoe was on the other foot & talking about your sisters body the food choices she was making etc your sister would be incensed, like someone else said your sisters issues are her own & she needs to address them not project them onto your gf especially bc she was meeting her for the first time", "NTA - Commenting on people\u2019s bodies is rude. Period. Doesn\u2019t matter if you have your own body issues.", "NTA.\n\nEven if your girlfriend happened to be someone who *could* eat whatever she wanted without gaining an once, your sister doesn\u2019t have the right to comment, especially in front of others.\n\nWomen are usually aware the most other women have some body image issues no matter what they look like to everyone else. At 22 she should be aware enough to realize that she isn\u2019t the only person who doesn\u2019t love their body and has to work hard at it at that!\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with my weight and ate strict keto for a decade. I\u2019ve been a size 8 and a size 22 so I empathize with both situations. \n\nI might mention the conversation you had with your sister to your gf. That way not only does she get to know that you noticed and stood up for her, she may also decide to share her past with your sister. Not that she should or that your sister has any right to know, but if she\u2019s comfortable, it could nip this in the bud. \n\nIt\u2019s a good lesson for you sister that what you see is only a tiny bit of the story.", "Completely NTA!\nSelf conscious or not, she doesn't have the right to take out her frustration on your gf! If anything she is harming your girl friend's mental health given her old history. \n\nFor safety of your gf, you should draw the boundary with your sister and let her that you will not appreciate or tolerate such comments! No where on this earth they are justified!", "NTA - sticking up for your gf is your job.", "NTA \n\nYour sister was acting like a jealous cow. I understand she doesn\u2019t know all the hard times your gf had to go through to get to get to the point she is now, but your sister has literally no right whatsoever to comment on your gf\u2019s body, or be nasty just because your gf looks good and your sister feels insecure about herself.", "NTA Your sister is insecure and childish. If I were you, I would have a few words about with sister about how hard GF works to keep that shape, with diet and exercise. I would then inform her that if she can't be polite, she needs be quiet because you aren't going to tolerate her rudeness. I spent years getting crap about how I could eat anything and not gain weight. I shut it down myself by telling people that if they would just get crippling depression and anorexia, they could starve themselves to a near fatal body weight... and maintain that for 2 years... so they too could kill off all their useful gut bacteria enabling them to eat anything and gain no nutrition from it the same way I did. It took me a while to find out that being brutally honest about how you are able to get and keep that super skinny figure, they realize pretty quickly that need to shut up.", "NTA - No one should be commenting on anyone else's body type. Good for you for standing up for your girlfriend. Its refreshing to see partners who actually do that and not stay silent.", "NTA, your sister is taking out her insecurities on your girlfriend.", "NTA but your sister needs to get a grip. All that energy into making snippy comments would be best used I. Eating healthier and exercising.", "Nta you told her the truth, your gf is not 'able to eat.anything and stay skinny'  You also told her in *private* whereas her snotty comments were in *public*", "NTA I think you handled it very well by waiting until she was alone to talk to her.", "NTA. If I was rude to every person with a better body than me Id be a fucking bit\\*\\* all the time! lol. I will suggest that your sister should maybe see someone about her obvious body issues. Her immediate anger and refusal to apologize I feel like are signs that she is very self conscious and maybe even have body dysmorphia. Youre a good boyfriend and brother to stick up for your gf and to confront your sister in a private moment and not embarrass her in front of everyone.", "NTA - you talked privately to a family member about behavior that was out of line in a way designed to address the problem, defend your gf, and no humiliate your sister. It sounds like your sister has a lot of insecurities that she needs to work on but that doesn't give her the right to take it out on your gf.", "NTA. \n\nI bet your sister would start WW3 if someone commented on her figure and calling it body shaming. Then why does she have the right to do it to your girlfriend? \n\nGood job OP for standing up for your girlfriend.", "NTA. Your sister was being a giant AH attacking your GF. Even IF she had a perfect metabolism, it's not grounds for the sister body shaming or insulting her.\n\nYour sister needs to address her OWN insecurities.", "NTA - But I feel like all of this could have been avoided if you GF would have simply said something like \" Girl, I can't eat just anything I want. I have a very strict diet and I run 5 days a week to keep my body this way.\" She didn't have to say the surgery part or get snippy to your sister while still letting her know that she works hard to keep her body the way she wants it.", "NTA you sound like a great guy, not telling your sister about your gf's weight struggles... But try to remember your sister is only going off of what she sees, and some people really are lucky enough to eat whatever they want. My brother was one of them, where as I gain 5 lbs smelling the bread. Perhaps your gf could talk to your sister? Could she share the diet and exercise she foIlows with your sister that allows her to eat like that on special occasions?  People tend to understand the known and we all know how people spiral out of control with the unknown as your sister has so clearly shown.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her comments were rude and needed to be addressed, but you didn\u2019t embarrass her by doing it in front of the family. And your actions showed respect and love to your girlfriend.", "NTA. Your sister is very inconsiderate of your gf. Everyone has things they are dealing with. Hopefully, your sister can see that this is a way she could bond with your gf, instead of being mean. Her attitude is harmful to herself and your gf. Perhaps you should all work out together or something. It's not fair for your gf to be treated that way. It's good for you to stop it before it gets worse.", "Yes to this. If the sister has an issue with someone\u2019s presence being there, that\u2019s her own problem, what does she expect the gf to do? Not date the OP anymore just to make her feel comfortable around the holidays?", "Yeah I wanted to make sure it was private.  I would never want to call her out in front of anyone and embarrass her.", "My gf doesn't like to explain it too much because in her experience, people then continue asking more and more personal questions and want to get even more specific about exactly what her diet and exercise routine is and then people feel like they can bring it up to my gf any time they see her.  I think it gets very tiring and annoying for my gf to feel like that's all people want to talk about with her.", "I don't really know any of the people involved so take my advice with a grain of salt but maybe you could tell your gf about it and maybe have her talk to your sister about how she struggled with her weight loss and maybe that would help. Of course I can see one or both of them not being receptive to the idea but I would consider it", ">maybe you could tell your gf about it and maybe have her talk to your sister about how she struggled with her weight loss and maybe that would help\n\n\nYeah, they need to take this with a grain of salt cos what if gf thoroughly hates that time of her life? And sister is an adult, does she do it to every stranger with \"perfect body?\" \nShe needs to handle her issues.", "NTA and I think you handled it really well. Your sister obviously is a lot more self-conscious about her weight than you thought. But making snippy comments to a slimmer person isn't the way to handle it, and just comes over as bitter. Even if your girlfriend hadn't had weight issues and surgery, it still wasn't appropriate.\n\nI struggle with my weight and fight really hard to keep it down. I have friends who are just effortlessly naturally slim. I never feel resentful of them for it. Their naturally slim figures aren't a personal attack on me!\n\nYour sister is projecting what is obviously an inner shame at her weight onto your girlfriend. I am sorry for your sister because I know how bad it hurts to hate your own body. But lashing out at your girlfriend just isn't fair.", "Nta. You did it privately whilst respecting your gfs privacy. Maybe you can have a discussion with your gf about talking to your sister privately about her past with weight and what she does to maintain how she looks now.\n\nI think it could be a positive influence on your sister whilst creating a good relationship between the two of them. Your gf could be a positive influence that your sister needs.\n\nEdit: obviously if your gf doesn't like that idea that's OK as well. I'm not super chirpy about how I used to be 150kgs and am very self conscious about that period of my life. However I am a lot more open about it if people ask. I have a coworker who is very overweight and in a discussion I told him about how I used to be and now he asks me for advice on certain things and works out occasionally with me (he has lost 10 kgs thus far am v proud of him).\n\n(For any one interested, I did keto, calorie counting and being in a 15% deficit,intimittent fasting and worked out 4 days a week). I lost that weight within 14 months. \n\nI do exercise regularly, however I don't do the other stuff anymore.\n\nI go back to keto whenever I gained 10 kgs and usually after holiday periods to maintain weight as I find keto easier to do in bursts now then to maintain it all year around now I'm at a good weight. Even when I'm off keto I still keep low carbs, just not as intense as when I am on it.", "NTA - way to go for standing up for your gf against your family while still keeping your gf's surgery a secret. It goes a long way to building trust in a relationship.", "NTA\n\nYou did exactly the right thing. Commenting on someone else's body or eating habits is *extremely* rude (especially in this manner), and it's your job to ensure your family treats your SO with respect. Your sister needs to deal with her insecurities herself, not by blaming your girlfriend's existence for her feelings.", "NTA- if/when your sister eventually finds out how hard your gf has had to work, she will have learned a valuable lesson about never really knowing what someone else is going through. You sound like a lively boyfriend and a kind brother.", "NTA. Your sister is a brat though. As an overweight lady, I would never think to judge a thinner person and put them down. As I know what it's like to be judged based on my looks, I would NEVER do that to another. No one has any right to pass judgement on anyone elses body type and the sooner people realize this the better. Your sister obviously has issues with her own weight, so either she deals with it and loses the weight or wears it proudly. She cant have it both ways.", "NTA good for doing it in private as you say she has no idea what your gf does to keep that body good on her btw for having that discipline", "Definitely NTA. Your sister is projecting her own body issues onto others. Commenting on the bodies of others or trying to police their food choices is rude. Period.", "NTA, the mere fact you went and talked to your sister privately should have clued her in to the fact that his girlfriend has a story behind her \u2018perfect body\u2019.", "NTA and I 100% agree that you should not comment on other\u2019s bodies like this. If you are a close friend or family member and gently approach someone about rapid weight loss or gain out of concern for their health that\u2019s one thing, snarky comments at the dinner table are completely different. You handled this perfectly OP, you talked to her privately and did your best not to embarrass anyone."]}
