We are both fortunate to be successful professionals with high earning power. We have a 4-year old who is in pre-K 5 days a week from 9 to 5:30, and sleeps well (730-7:00). We have cleaners that come 2x/week and we split the remaining household duties 50/50 (we have a written schedule that encapsulates cooking, dishes, dog duties, laundry, etc). My wife is the \"default parent\" for our son and childcare for her is often more stressful than it is for me because our son demands her attention a lot, whereas if I am watching him he is often content to play on his own.\n\nAbout a year ago we decided that my wife would stop working. Since the birth of our son she had been having a difficult time balancing her extremely demanding job with family life with a kid (For context, we had a full-time nanny and our son has always slept well, but it's hard to fit family life in-between a 70-80hr/wk job). To be honest, this has been amazing for our relationship and my wife's mental and physical health. We previously were on the fast-track to divorce given the stress her job was placing on our relationship.\n\nWhile my job is much less demanding (40hrs/wk on average), and I am fortunate to make enough to support us comfortably as long as we maintain a (quite high IMO) budget. This has been the case for a few years. Last year, while my wife was working, her post-tax income ($9k/month) was entirely discretionary. I have been responsible for paying for housing, pre-k, childcare, restaurants, groceries, insurance, etc. As a part of my wife\u2019s move to not working she agreed to cut her discretionary budget to $6k/month. She\u2019s been over-budget by about $1k/month on average since then and I haven\u2019t said anything about it yet\n\nThings came to a head this week when my wife mentioned, in passing, buying an expensive gift for her best friend\u2019s birthday. She doesn\u2019t have the money for this purchase in her existing budget as she\u2019s already spent ahead of her budget for the rest of the year. I had a talk with her where I told her that I\u2019m happy to fund it, but in the future if she wants to buy expensive things that are out of the budget she needs to save for them. I do the same thing myself with a discretionary budget that is 60% of her discretionary budget.\n\nThis caused my wife my wife to get mad at me, she told me she understood and didn\u2019t argue, but when I asked her how she was feeling she said she had \u201cnothing productive to say\u201d. She also told me she wants to audit how much I\u2019m spending on gifts so we can make sure we\u2019re spending the same, which I think is ridiculous. My own gifting is part of my discretionary budget, which is 40% less than hers and which I stick to quite consistently. The last two days my wife has been sulking and won\u2019t talk to me about it. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m being far more than reasonable, but maybe not?", "created_utc": 1698339768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h16mn/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_needs_to_stick_to_a/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have the wrong problems in my life", "NTA\n\n$6k a month is more than a most people have for their entire not just discretionary. Jesus fuck. Your wife needs to understand that living within your means is what responsible adults do.\n\nEven in a high COL area, that's still a lot of money/month.", "...\n\nNTA. Who the hell can't keep it under $6k a month for \"discretionary\" spending??? What in the ever loving hell does she spend $1500 on a week? That's insanity. I guess when you don't work and your kid is gone ALL DAY you can find some things to dump money on. The only thing I'd agree with is if you can see how she spends her money, she should be able to see how you spend yours. Anyways. \n\nIt's really hard to feel remotely sorry for her sulking. You are being totally reasonable. Your overall income just dropped substantially for her to be a stay at home mom, it's reasonable to expect that will come with a lifestyle adjustment. And this can't be that big of an adjustment, her monthly discretionary income is more than some people have for 6 months-year.", "NTA, but by all means make sure the \"books\" are open for auditing - while I wouldn't scrutinize every expenditure, the total income vs. spending vs. savings should be clear. If she's really spending 40% more than you every month on discretionary expenses, she needs to apologize and get her head in the game.", "Why not let her see what you\u2019re spending on gifts to show her how much less it is.", "I\u2019m so lost. \n\nI need more info: You pay for cleaning twice a week, pre k and child care and\u2026 she\u2019s a stay at home parent? What is she doing all day?\n\nIf your child is at pre k 5 days a week from 9-5:30 I think an easier solution is for your wife to find a job that is only 40hrs a week or work part time. Unsure what field you are in but maybe she\u2019s really unhappy being a stay at home parent with not much to do. Especially if she was used to working 70 hours a week. Maybe she wants to be busier.", "NTA.\n\nINFO: How does your wife spend 6K a month?", "NTA. I think it\u2019s a good thing that she starts monitoring. Clearly, she is not paying full attention because that is your burden in the relationship. Her monitoring is, hopefully, going to open her eyes to her spending and allow her to budget a bit better.", "Money is power. She now has less power. Ouch.", "Nta.   Budgets are reasonable.  That said it\u2019s also reasonable for her to ask to see how you are spending your discretionary budget.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is a stereotypical spoiled princess.\n\nHow much did she save from her salary?\n\nI think it's extremely foolish for her to quit her job.", "INFO: what does she spend her discretionary fund on? Does it include family vacations, kid's clothes or extracurriculars?", "So I also stay home while my husband works. I am 40f he is 53m. I don't have a degree or anything so I really wasn't bringing a lot in, he does well, so he suggested it. It has been AMAZING for our marriage. I absolutely love handling all the household things and cooking etc and he likes the lack of stress. His kids were grown when we got together about 8 years ago, and I didn't have/want any. I never thought we would be a one income house but it's been absolutely lovely. But we agreed early on he would handle the money. He made budgets and such. I'm not ridiculous with money but he is MUCH better at it. I always lived paycheck to paycheck. On the very rare occasions i had a few dollars extra, I just didnt have the mindset to put it away. In our marriage, There have a couple times he had to \"check\" me for lack of a better word for going over on this and that. Nothing wild just a $100 over budget spend here and there. Anyway, last year, our AC went out. We live in Louisiana. We got married 2 years ago, had been in our new home about 6 months when it happened. I immediately went into panic mode about how to pay the 3 grand it would cost to replace the whole unit. Then my husband reminded me, we have money saved for these times. And we have that money saved because we budget and plan. It was a moment thst changed my mindset to the whole dynamic. Like the recent baby shower I was asked to help host. I told them I could not contribute over a certain amount (and they wanted ridiculous things like $150 balloon arch). Or a friend's birthday gift. That extra $50 here and $100 there is the difference between being prepared for a financial emergency and not being prepared. \nWhat I'm saying is, remind her that the budgets and planning and living a little bit more skinny than we sometimes want is the reason she gets to stay home and sleep well knowing a $3,000 fix will not make yall choose between eating and internet that month. My husband has NEVER been sexier than the day the ac went out, and he was able to remind me that the very small sacrifices we made before we the reason we didn't have to make a big one right now. \nThere are still days we fuss a little over what to spend. There are times we splurge just for the hell of it. There are times we both go without something we really want. But whenever I think I'm missing out because I can't spend, I remember that day in August when when the air went out at 5pm and it was 105 outside but we were in a 70\u00b0 house by 8 that night.", ">I feel like I\u2019m being far more than reasonable, but maybe not?\n\nReasonable? Probably. Rational? Certainly. Unfortunately, people are not always either reasonable or rational and often resent authority even when it is reminding them of terms they agreed to. \n\nThe only thing I can see you've done wrong here is structure your finances in such a way that puts you in the position of being the spouse who says \"No.\" NAH, but be prepared to audit and renegotiate in light of any emerging resentment from your spouse.", "NTA -- and I would be very concerned about where this money is going.   Drugs or alchohol does happen.  Other things she may not want to share.   Helping family or friends should be discussed.", "The biggest issue is here that she have no clue of what the income/expenses are. If you manage to give insight in this, she may wel realize that her overspending is not something you all can afford. If it doesn't work and continues, you may need to set a weekly budget on her, which she can't overspend. (Bank-blockade) you have the responsible to keep your family financially healthy.", "ESH. You\u2019re both still adjusting to a huge drop in income and it takes time. Try splitting the discretionary spending into thirds. You both get an equal amount and spend it on gifts, your own clothes, or whatever, and the final third is spend on the child\u2019s clothes, toys, fun, etc. This is easily solved with cooperation.", "ESH. This seems like a ridiculous situation where two people seem to be extremely entitled and not communicating at all. So, you have a house cleaner come twice a week? That seems excessive if you guys are cleaning yourselves. Also, you aren\u2019t on the same page with a ridiculous budget. Your wife seems to resent you. There seems to be a LOT more going on here. Seems like you can afford it, so you should go to therapy. You, personally, should go with the intent of being a better husband and to figure out why your wife hates you. Sleeping 12 hours a night? She seems depressed. And TELLING her what to do instead of discussing? Sounds like you\u2019re bossing her around. Ugh. This all sucks.", "YTA. Your wife earned more, parented more and you did what? Worked less hours, earned less and didn\u2019t even compensate that in parenting. If you\u2019d been more adjusting, she wouldn\u2019t have quit her job and she could\u2019ve still been working and able to afford whatever she wanted.
