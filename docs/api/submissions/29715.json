We are both fortunate to be successful professionals with high earning power. We have a 4-year old who is in pre-K 5 days a week from 9 to 5:30, and sleeps well (730-7:00). We have cleaners that come 2x/week and we split the remaining household duties 50/50 (we have a written schedule that encapsulates cooking, dishes, dog duties, laundry, etc). My wife is the \"default parent\" for our son and childcare for her is often more stressful than it is for me because our son demands her attention a lot, whereas if I am watching him he is often content to play on his own.\n\nAbout a year ago we decided that my wife would stop working. Since the birth of our son she had been having a difficult time balancing her extremely demanding job with family life with a kid (For context, we had a full-time nanny and our son has always slept well, but it's hard to fit family life in-between a 70-80hr/wk job). To be honest, this has been amazing for our relationship and my wife's mental and physical health. We previously were on the fast-track to divorce given the stress her job was placing on our relationship.\n\nWhile my job is much less demanding (40hrs/wk on average), and I am fortunate to make enough to support us comfortably as long as we maintain a (quite high IMO) budget. This has been the case for a few years. Last year, while my wife was working, her post-tax income ($9k/month) was entirely discretionary. I have been responsible for paying for housing, pre-k, childcare, restaurants, groceries, insurance, etc. As a part of my wife\u2019s move to not working she agreed to cut her discretionary budget to $6k/month. She\u2019s been over-budget by about $1k/month on average since then and I haven\u2019t said anything about it yet\n\nThings came to a head this week when my wife mentioned, in passing, buying an expensive gift for her best friend\u2019s birthday. She doesn\u2019t have the money for this purchase in her existing budget as she\u2019s already spent ahead of her budget for the rest of the year. I had a talk with her where I told her that I\u2019m happy to fund it, but in the future if she wants to buy expensive things that are out of the budget she needs to save for them. I do the same thing myself with a discretionary budget that is 60% of her discretionary budget.\n\nThis caused my wife my wife to get mad at me, she told me she understood and didn\u2019t argue, but when I asked her how she was feeling she said she had \u201cnothing productive to say\u201d. She also told me she wants to audit how much I\u2019m spending on gifts so we can make sure we\u2019re spending the same, which I think is ridiculous. My own gifting is part of my discretionary budget, which is 40% less than hers and which I stick to quite consistently. The last two days my wife has been sulking and won\u2019t talk to me about it. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m being far more than reasonable, but maybe not?", "created_utc": 1698339768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h16mn/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_needs_to_stick_to_a/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only thing I'd agree with is if you can see how she spends her money, she should be able to see how you spend yours. Anyways. \n\nIt's really hard to feel remotely sorry for her sulking. You are being totally reasonable. Your overall income just dropped substantially for her to be a stay at home mom, it's reasonable to expect that will come with a lifestyle adjustment.

I don't have a degree or anything so I really wasn't bringing a lot in, he does well, so he suggested it. It has been AMAZING for our marriage. I absolutely love handling all the household things and cooking etc and he likes the lack of stress. His kids were grown when we got together about 8 years ago, and I didn't have/want any. I never thought we would be a one income house but it's been absolutely lovely. But we agreed early on he would handle the money. He made budgets and such. I'm not ridiculous with money but he is MUCH better at it. I always lived paycheck to paycheck. On the very rare occasions i had a few dollars extra, I just didnt have the mindset to put it away. In our marriage, There have a couple times he had to \"check\" me for lack of a better word for going over on this and that. Nothing wild just a $100 over budget spend here and there. Anyway, last year, our AC went out. We live in Louisiana. We got married 2 years ago, had been in our new home about 6 months when it happened. I immediately went into panic mode about how to pay the 3 grand it would cost to replace the whole unit. Then my husband reminded me, we have money saved for these times. And we have that money saved because we budget and plan. It was a moment thst changed my mindset to the whole dynamic. Like the recent baby shower I was asked to help host. I told them I could not contribute over a certain amount (and they wanted ridiculous things like $150 balloon arch). Or a friend's birthday gift. That extra $50 here and $100 there is the difference between being prepared for a financial emergency and not being prepared. \nWhat I'm saying is, remind her that the budgets and planning and living a little bit more skinny than we sometimes want is the reason she gets to stay home and sleep well knowing a $3,000 fix will not make yall choose between eating and internet that month. My husband has NEVER been sexier than the day the ac went out, and he was able to remind me that the very small sacrifices we made before we the reason we didn't have to make a big one right now. \nThere are still days we fuss a little over what to spend. There are times we splurge just for the hell of it. There are times we both go without something we really want. But whenever I think I'm missing out because I can't spend, I remember that day in August when when the air went out at 5pm and it was 105 outside but we were in a 70\u00b0 house by 8 that night.", ">I feel like I\u2019m being far more than reasonable, but maybe not?\n\nReasonable? Probably. Rational? Certainly. Unfortunately, people are not always either reasonable or rational and often resent authority even when it is reminding them of terms they agreed to. \n\nThe only thing I can see you've done wrong here is structure your finances in such a way that puts you in the position of being the spouse who says \"No.\" NAH, but be prepared to audit and renegotiate in light of any emerging resentment from your spouse.", "NTA -- and I would be very concerned about where this money is going.   Drugs or alchohol does happen.  Other things she may not want to share.   Helping family or friends should be discussed.", "The biggest issue is here that she have no clue of what the income/expenses are. If you manage to give insight in this, she may wel realize that her overspending is not something you all can afford. If it doesn't work and continues, you may need to set a weekly budget on her, which she can't overspend. (Bank-blockade) you have the responsible to keep your family financially healthy.", "ESH. You\u2019re both still adjusting to a huge drop in income and it takes time. Try splitting the discretionary spending into thirds. You both get an equal amount and spend it on gifts, your own clothes, or whatever, and the final third is spend on the child\u2019s clothes, toys, fun, etc. This is easily solved with cooperation.", "ESH. This seems like a ridiculous situation where two people seem to be extremely entitled and not communicating at all. So, you have a house cleaner come twice a week? That seems excessive if you guys are cleaning yourselves. Also, you aren\u2019t on the same page with a ridiculous budget. Your wife seems to resent you. There seems to be a LOT more going on here. Seems like you can afford it, so you should go to therapy. You, personally, should go with the intent of being a better husband and to figure out why your wife hates you. Sleeping 12 hours a night? She seems depressed. And TELLING her what to do instead of discussing? Sounds like you\u2019re bossing her around. Ugh. This all sucks.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What is she doing with her time?\u201d I am also a married parent who does not work outside the home, so perhaps I can provide some perspective. Sorry, this will be long, but let me start with a tiny bit of background about me. I have a PhD and never planned to become a stay at home mom. But my husband is a physician who works strange hours. For me, the reality check was that I would be spending as much money on childcare as I would bring in with a postdoctoral position, and I would give up the flexibility to see my husband when he is actually off work. Nights and weekends are kind of a thing in emergency medicine. So my work would be just for the sake of the work and would come with sacrifices. So what worked for our family was that while our daughter was still a toddler, I was a full-time parent. And exhausted. When she went to preK, we realized we were happy with the way things were, and I decided not to find work. I did have more free time, so I did start some volunteer work and spend more time on hobbies. However, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing to be done around the house. \n\nFirst of all, perhaps those critical folks have never parented a four year old, but it\u2019s exhausting! Children that age can have very strong opinions! Parenting is nonstop and mentally draining. It is part of their developmental process to push back against their parents and try to be independent. But at the same time they don\u2019t understand why certain things have to be done the way they do, so you have endless micro-battles over everything from wearing pajamas to school to eating the occasional vegetable to why it\u2019s rude when you call the meal your mother prepared for you \u201cgrossy\u201d. But they can\u2019t do much for themselves, so you have to supervise everything they do. And parents of young children get zero vacation from that. Even when you\u2019re ostensibly on vacation, you have the battles with your child over meals and clothes and bathtime and bedtime. So if you\u2019re going to get any downtime, it has to be while the kid is in somebody else\u2019s care. This is why the OP says it has been so good for his marriage to have his wife quit her job. All of the childcare and general admin that comes with life has to be done outside of your work hours, and it\u2019s so important to have time to spend on your partner, fun with your kid, and taking care of yourself. If you\u2019re both tired and stressed when you get home, your home life is going to suffer.\n\nSo next, I\u2019d like to dismantle the ridiculous argument that having a cleaner come in *twice a month* means mom has nothing to do at home. Children are messy! They are messy eaters, they find the moment to sneak away and flush a chopstick down the toilet, they put stickers on your furniture, and in general they create completely unique kind of messes that grown-ups would never even dream of creating, and those have to be dealt with. For instance, young children have an occasional, but alarming, tendency to wet the bed or projectile vomit. The person who has to be at work at nine is probably not going to be the one washing the sheets at two in the morning.\n\nKids also come with a lot of admin. They get sick all the time and require their own doctor and dentist appointments that you have to take them to. Grandparents want to see the kid, so you have to schedule visits to them or time to host them in your own home. Both can be a lot of work. Kids also have social lives that you have to manage, and that takes time and mental energy.\n\nRunning a household as partners necessitates a division of labor to keep things running smoothly. if you are home during the day, you are probably also taking on a larger share of the management of the home. And that creates a lot of mental labor. So you do the things that can\u2019t be done in the evening, like waiting around for the cable guy and making phone calls. You know what tasks have and have not gotten done while your partner was out of the house and have to relay that information to your partner. And because I think it would be unusual for the partner with the full-time job to be responsible for the meal planning and grocery shopping, I\u2019m going to assume that as the stay at home mom you will probably take care of that. Dad can be told what the dinner plan is and and be expected to make dinner, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg as far as the work goes. Now when you do tasks things more often, you end up with the particular knowledge to efficiently complete them. So if you want help you have to delegate, but often you find situations where it would actually be easier just to do it yourself, even when your partner is a willing and helpful participant. \n\nThink about grocery shopping. I make the grocery list. I know that I need to have two cans of diced peeled tomatoes in the pantry. And I also do the cooking because I enjoy it and my husband does not. I know that because I made chili three nights ago I used one of those cans and a can of tomato pur\u00e9e. But my shopping list doesn\u2019t say I need one *14 oz* can of *petite* diced, no salt added, without Italian seasoning, tomatoes. I just write diced peeled tomatoes and know what that means. Now imagine that you need limes, but how many you buy depends on how big they are. And that you want bananas, but if they are green you need to buy some other fruit to eat until the bananas ripen. This sort of decision happens with every item on a grocery list. If my husband wanted to do the grocery shopping I would have to write such a ridiculously detailed list that it would be faster to just do it myself. Not to mention insulting to him! And that\u2019s only one of the chores that keeps a household going. I guarantee you there are responsibilities like this she routinely handles that he doesn\u2019t even need to think about. And this is part of why their marriage is so much better: both parties have fewer things to worry about because she doesn\u2019t have a stressful job, and she can take some of the household burden off him in return. But meanwhile, too many of you are assuming she\u2019s just shopping in boutiques all day.\n\nI also want to point out that human interaction is essential to your mental health. If his wife is not going to a workplace and interacting with people there, she needs to get out of the house and have a social outlet of some description. So maybe she goes to yoga or meets up with other moms for lunch or coffee or even shopping! And I think too many of you see something like that happening while her husband is at work and chalk that up to living the highlife while he brings home the bacon. But if you\u2019ve been in her situation, you would see it\u2019s not all frivolity. Her strong mental health makes his life better.\n\nWell, if you made it to the end of this post, thank you!

Now that I\u2019m going through a divorce, I wouldn\u2019t mind\u2026.. of course, I have two kids, so\u2026\n\nMostly kidding, but if I had been given the opportunity to stay home and take care of my kids when they were younger, I\u2019d have gladly done it.  Now that I\u2019m a single dad, i am truly blessed/lucky to be able to work from home, so I make money and am home for the kids.  Win-win", "You WHAT? I'm just over here raising my two little kids working 70 hrs per week with some slight help from family and a housecleaner 1x/week and feeling spoiled for it.", "Millions would like 6k/month income!", "He says the child is in pre-K, but the hours he lists are not consistent with school hours. They are consistent with a daycare center offering a \"pre-K\" curriculum, which is what I meant.", "She\u2019s over budget \u2026. Cut out the donations.\n\nShe has a budget if the causes she is supporting matter to her she will spend less elsewhere.", "Idk if therapy should really count as discretionary though. That's more like a medical expense.", "I think it was wrong that wife spent ALL OF HER INCOME however she wanted. No savings, no retirement, nada. So now she is used to spending whatever she wants. NO ONE needs to spend $6k a month on non-essentials. The consumerism related to that is mind-boggling!", "I was referring to \u201cwhen there\u2019s a parent at home\u201d.  The child was in daycare/pre-k when both parents were working.  But now that a parent is home I\u2019m not sure if the child is still there or if the child is at home.", "yeah would like to know that, too\u2026 9000 is over half of my annual salary\u2026", "I was hoping they were the goop candles that smell like Gwyneth Paltrow \u2018s vagina, but apparently those only cost $75.. they HAVE to smell like someone\u2019s vagina or some other insane thing though, for that kind of money!", "I know, right?! It can be done!", "I was expecting it was something people light up....but not candles"]}
