{"id": 799, "submission_id": "yjjbf0", "title": "AITA For refusing to loan my GF money unless she signs a contract and I keep an itemized list of what she owes me", "selftext": "My GF (24F) and I (25M) have been together for almost 5 years.  We met in college and moved in together about a year ago.  She picked her passion as a major in college (art) whereas I picked a more practical degree (accounting).  I work for a firm and earn a nice salary.  She works as a server and sells art she makes online and at some art fairs.  She's sick and tired of being a server and has been thinking of going back to school.  I've suggested she look into coding bootcamps.  \n\nShe found one that is very reputable and has a great track record, but it's pretty spendy.  She already has student loans and since her income to debt ratio is not good and she has a low credit score, she hasn't been able to find a place that will give her another loan without extortionate interest rates.  I suggested asking family for a loan, but she does not have a good relationship with her family (they aren't NC, but damn close).  \n\nAfter exhausting all her options, she came to me.  When she asked me, I could tell she felt terrible about it.  We ran some numbers and she would need about $15-20K for the coding class.  It's a 9-month program with about 30-40 hours a week.  So she would have to cut back her hours considerably from the 40-45 she's currently working.  She plans to work 15-20 hours a week to still earn some income.  \n\nShe has just over $5K in savings.  She asked if I would be willing to help her pay for the rest of her program and for me to help cover more of the expenses because she won't be earning as much.  I told her the only way I would feel comfortable giving her that amount of money would be if she signed a contract and we kept an itemized list of all the extra expenses I am taking on so that we can work out a payment plan when she starts earning more money again.  I am NOT adding interest onto anything.\n\nShe got mad at me because she feels like I am not trusting her.  But I'm just trying to protect a sizeable investment.  She is also mad that I will be keeping track of every additional cost I am taking on and expecting her to pay me back.  She thinks I should just be willing to pay more and to think of it as an investment in our future together since her getting a better job will benefit us both.  She's OK with paying back the cost of her program, but not the additional costs I will be paying because she's earning less.\n\nI told her this is a much better deal than she would get from anyone else, but if she wants to keep looking for different options or take a loan with a super high interest rate, she's free to do that as well.  She feels like I'm trying to make a profit off of her trying to better herself.  But honestly, I'm just thinking about breaking even.  \n\nWe've talked about getting married, but we aren't even engaged yet.  I do want to spend the rest of my life with her, but life happens and who knows for sure.  I'm just trying to protect myself, but she's taking this idea as a personal attack on her trustworthiness.", "created_utc": 1667332425, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjjbf0/aita_for_refusing_to_loan_my_gf_money_unless_she/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She came to me to ask if I will help her pay for it.  I agreed, but with conditions.  She didn't like my conditions and now thinks I don't trust her.

NTA.", "No judgement on the situation here, but she does not need a coding bootcamp. When applying for jobs, it gives no more clout over a full self-taught programmer. The hardest part is getting that first job. She can do courses on www.codecademy.com and if looking at web development, can do the Odin project. I'm self-learning, and in a short amount of time, I'm way ahead of where a 9 month bootcamp would have got me. I'm actually applying for jobs now, but need more in my portfolio. All I've spent is ~$100 for codecademy pro.", "NTA. Asking her to sign a contract for the money you\u2019ll be spending for her class makes sense; you two aren\u2019t married and legally making sure you\u2019re paid back a large chunk of money is totally fair on your part. Although I do wonder how you\u2019ll handle it in the future if you choose to get married and your finances become one, but that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to tackle if you get there. \n\nWhere I start to question things is you wanting to make an itemized list of expenses you\u2019ll be covering more of while she\u2019s in school so that can be tacked onto the money she has to pay you back. It is at that point it is starting to feel less like a relationship and more as a business transaction. I do understand where you\u2019re coming from, but if this is someone you genuinely want to spend the rest of your life with I\u2019d consider how helping to support her now without adding more debt hanging over her may be a benefit to you both.", "NTA.....but only just....with the potential for a recount.\n\nAs myth-busting as it may be, it really IS best to treat money as money in close relationships. At least as far as the loan goes.\n\nMAYBE rethink the whole \"additional expense\" thing...that's a wee bit bloodless for someone who wants enough goodwill down the line to put a ring on it. Sacrifice in the name of love...to say nothing of in the name of future earnings benefitting both parties...is a worthy one.\n\nAfter all, you want to end up with both your initial investment AND your GF when all is said and done. Might be time to itemize her goodwill as a non-fungible asset rather than something you just assume you could find elsewhere. The best financial deals entail SOME level of risk. And the reward is nothing to sneeze at.", "NTA.\n\nBut I get why she thinks you are, it was hard for her to come to you in the first place, and then feels like she's getting a bad deal from the man she wants to spend the rest of her life with ... but you can't predict the future and it's fair to want the money paid back on the investment for the school ... maybe you're going too far with the additional expenses but I can see where you're coming from.\n\nETA: That I think you may come across really judgmental even if you don't mean to. You lead your story with you taking a practical course in life and her taking a more passionate course in life. She's now wanting to be more practical, you made a suggestion, she followed it and now *dun dun dun* the contract ... I really can see why she would say that you're the AH here even though I can't quite bring myself to rule that way.", "NAH. Handling finances in a couple is always tricky.", "NTA. She isn\u2019t asking for $100. She asking for a large no interest pay out. Honestly, I don\u2019t think coding would be right for her but I don\u2019t know her personally. There are things she can do to start getting scholarships and start working on that degree but if she isn\u2019t willing to put the time and effort that is on her. Honestly, I would say start looking into other jobs, or possibly try to get into a vocational career that she can work up towards. I really think that will go further than possibly putting down a ton of money for a job she may or may not like.", "NTA\n\nIt is your money - not only do you get to choose how you spend it or give it away you also get to choose how you get it back", "NTA. \"Make a profit off of her\"\n\nHow the hell are you gonna make a profit if you won't be charging interest?", "NTA. She wants you to front her at least $15,000 and pay the vast majority of everyday expenses. I'm surprised you'd go along with this, so asking for some accounting is not unreasonable at all.", "This is kind of the same reasoning behind getting a prenup. Most people don\u2019t get married intending to divorce, but it\u2019s still smart to get a prenup if someone enters the relationship with significantly more assets, or even if both parties have significant assets. Imagine y\u2019all do break up and all you have is a promise to pay you back? That\u2019s a lot of money down the drain. NTA.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re an accountant and this is the most accountant thing I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s beautiful.", "NTA, but BARELY that.\n\nIt makes perfect sense if you loan her the cost of the program and she pays you back (either with cash or that amount towards a down payment on a house or something).\n\nBut to nickel and dime the next 9 months is insane. Your relationship will become transactional, and that is miserable.", "NTA. It would be an investment in your future. BUT, only if you are married and have joint finances.\n\nWithout an enforceable contract, she can break up with you any day and you\u2019re just thousands of dollars in the hole. Eff that. \n\nAnd she\u2019s not factoring in the extra cost of you paying more into expenses because she is earning less? NOT COOL. I was a coding bootcamp grad and she can kiss that 15 hour work week goodbye. The 30-40 hours is just class time - the rest is independent coding time and doing your portfolio projects. She\u2019s realistically looking at 60-80 hour weeks. I didn\u2019t even do much chores during bootcamp.\n\nYour gf is being selfish. You\u2019re being plenty supportive to even be ok with loaning her the money without interest.", "NAH. She thought y\u2019all were planning a future together. You don\u2019t see her as a sure bet. You\u2019re just not in the same place with each other. That\u2019s nobodies fault.", "NTA, but it would be better if she just took out another loan and then paid it off.  The stress of having a ledger would suck.  If you get married you can approach the debt as a couple.  Also if you plan to have children, will she stay home with them?  Again you would be responsible for the debt.  Good luck.", "NTA for wanting her to sign a contract to pay back what you are lending her.\nYTA for not being willing to take on more of the household expenses while she is in school.\n\nWhen you are in a committed long-term relationship, you should be willing to subsidize household expenses during a period where the other partner is doing less well.  You should not treat this as a loan she has to pay back but as your taking on some of her burden to help her through this period.\n\nThe loan of the money for tuition is different and you should definitely have a contract.   Similarly if she borrows from you to pay for student loans.  It is only sensible to keep a record of big contributions like that, even within families and with domestic partnerships.\n\nYou never know what will happen in the future.  Tell her to imagine  that she wins the lottery today and gets run over by a truck tomorrow.  As you are not her spouse,  the next of kin would get her lottery winnings.  With a contract, you would have a claim to be paid back by whoever inherited the hypothetical winnings.", "NTA. No contract, no money. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't entitle her to your hard earned money.", "NTA but I think you sound a little bit condescending when you word it as 'you did a more practical course'. \n\nYou've just said you want to itemise the costs. She says you're trying to make a profit...not realising that itemising her costs will literally stop that from happening. If she expects you to pay for the additional costs out of kindness, she'll be profiting from you. It sounds like you really do need to keep an eye on the costs.\n\nGetting this done as a contract may seem harsh but no harsher than people who get prenups. You're just protecting yourself in case something happens. We can live in the clouds and pretend break-ups don't happen but that's very far from reality.", "I\u2019ve thought a lot about this one. You\u2019re NTA for asking for what you feel you\u2019re entitled to. However, continuing to charge her for living expenses makes you a terrible partner, and she would not be the asshole if she dumped you over that. You say you want to spend the rest of your life with this woman. At what point are you going to start working together to build that future? I completely understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to cover her tuition. It\u2019s a lot of money, and I\u2019m of the opinion people work harder at their studies if they pay for at least a chunk of it themselves.  But her part of the living expenses?  Love doesn\u2019t keep a tab. You\u2019re acting as if you won\u2019t benefit from the increased salary that comes with her new career. If you do stay together and become engaged, it\u2019s an investment in both of your futures.  This pettiness tells me you aren\u2019t ready to be in that kind of partnership with anyone. What you need is a roommate you can bone.", "NTA protect yourself at all costs. My Ex bf still owes me hella money. We did pretty much what you're going through and in the end the butthole left me broke. Don't loan anyone any money without a written signed contract stating you will be paid back", "I would loan her 20k with contract. She can use her savings and anything left to cover monthly costs. If you have to cover a little extra now and then so be it, but I understand not wanting to be on the hook for an unknown amount of expenses for months, with no plan of repayment.", "NTA- for the loan of money for school. It is a steep investment. \n\nHowever, start with a community college coding class first! Make sure it is something she wants ling term before throwing money at it.\n\nYTA- for the itemized budget for extra expenses.  This is entering tortured territory. Give her a list of what you will cover for how long: full rent and utilities, $500 for groceries for eight months- whatever you are willing to cover. Let her figure out how to finance the rest if her expenses. This is your investment in your relationship.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. The fact that you're not even charging interest and she's still mad makes it clear she saw this as free money.", "INFO : why do you think of adding the itemized extra expenses clause? are you guys currently living together and split 50-50?", "NTA. I think what she doesn't like is the implication she's on the hook if you two break up.", "NTA  I have seen MORE cases get filed in small claims courts for loaning money that doesn't get paid back.  Couples, friends, family.   There is a big difference between lending someone 100 bucks, and lending in the tens of thousands.  It has nothing to do with trust....it has to do with being wise and protecting yourself.  She is asking you to stick your neck out for her, and you are graciously willing to help her.  As you stated, you are not engaged or married at this point.  Even if you were, you'd still be wise to keep finances well documented when it comes to borrowing or lending.  \n\nIf she wants you to do this for her, she has to be willing to accept and respect the accurate accounting records you need to keep.  If not, she has the right to keep on looking for a different solution.  No one is going to hand over money to her without some contract being signed, so she may have to just work extra hours and save to fund her own future if she's opposed to doing so.", "NTA\n\nKeeping track of what she owes you is completely fine in my opinion.", "NTA but not the correct approach. First if you are in the US, charge interest. If you don't it is less likely to fly as a loan should you actually need to take it to court or write it off as bad debt. If you do get married the debt and interest just go away if you want depending on how you do your finances and state laws.\n\nBut don't keep track of each individual thing. Loan her the tuition plus half the rent for the length of time or just agree to cover her for a while. The daily tally of what you're owed will break the relationship.", "Relationships won't ever be 50/50 equal. You've been together for five years, that's a pretty decent amount of time.\n\nAsking for a loan agreement is fair and smart.\n\nBut perhaps you could consider taking on a larger amount of expenses, a lot of people divide their expenses based on income. Especially considering you'd both have more money at your disposal for future investments like down payments if she does this. \n\nNAH.", "Info: if she gets a loan elsewhere, will that loan be used for living expenses or just school? If she gets a loan elsewhere but can only use it for school, what\u2019s your plan for the living expenses?", "Nta. Just look at how many couples break up or divorce. Recognizing your relationship might not last forever is just realistic. Protect your money.", "Wanting to make the loan official is a smart move and it should be acceptable to your girlfriend, it is 15k after all, not just some small amount she'll be able to pay back instantly. But she's your partner of 5 years... If you're not willing to support her for 9 months by covering some/most of her share of utilities so that she can invest in a more practical plan for her (or should I say your) future, then why are you even with this person?

Do you feel she was foolish to pick art as her passion?

Because otherwise you will get screwed over.", "Maybe I\u2019ll get downvoted but I think you are mostly NTA but I do think her compromise to pay you back for the program but not the extra expenses is very reasonable. \n\nIn the state I live in, any degrees that are earned while you are married are community property of the marriage. So if I go back to school and get a degree and then my husband and I divorce, he could hire a lawyer to estimate the potential value of that degree and include it in distribution of assets. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t married, so if she leaves you post degree and you don\u2019t have an agreement for her to pay you back, you\u2019re just out of money. \n\nI do think however you should re-think trying to make her pay back living expenses. If you do plan to stay together, it will make your shared future better, so just help her out and support her while she goes back to school.

Your offer is mostly reasonable. \n\nI can guess why she's upset, though, on the matter of extra expenses. I suspect it has to do with her family.\n\nAsk her about her family's attitude toward money. Did they use money to control each other? Did her parents ever say she \"owed them\" because they fed and clothed her as a child, or something? Did they fight over who paid for what? \n\nYour family probably handled money very differently. The two of you need to sit down and talk about how your families dealt with money, how that affected your emotions about money, and family, and so forth.\n\nYou might find that your own family's attitudes toward money weren't 100% healthy, either.

Part of any relationship is people with different unspoken assumptions learning to speak about them, examining them, and then negotiating compromises between different ways of approaching life.", "YTA\n\nI get it for the school part, thats a huge sum to give to someone without security and she is willing to pay it back.

Would you expect the same sort of reimbursement if she lost here job or had her hours cut for another reason, like an illness? She on the other hand is being irrational to point based on her feelings for you now, which could actually change in the future. \nTo be totally honest you two need to sit down and have an honest discussion regarding finances and how you each see things.

We met in college and moved in together about a year ago.  She picked her passion as a major in college (art) whereas I picked a more practical degree (accounting).  I work for a firm and earn a nice salary.  She works as a server and sells art she makes online and at some art fairs.  She's sick and tired of being a server and has been thinking of going back to school.  I've suggested she look into coding bootcamps.  \n\nShe found one that is very reputable and has a great track record, but it's pretty spendy.  She already has student loans and since her income to debt ratio is not good and she has a low credit score, she hasn't been able to find a place that will give her another loan without extortionate interest rates.  I suggested asking family for a loan, but she does not have a good relationship with her family (they aren't NC, but damn close).  \n\nAfter exhausting all her options, she came to me.  When she asked me, I could tell she felt terrible about it.  We ran some numbers and she would need about $15-20K for the coding class.  It's a 9-month program with about 30-40 hours a week.  So she would have to cut back her hours considerably from the 40-45 she's currently working.  She plans to work 15-20 hours a week to still earn some income.  \n\nShe has just over $5K in savings.  She asked if I would be willing to help her pay for the rest of her program and for me to help cover more of the expenses because she won't be earning as much.  I told her the only way I would feel comfortable giving her that amount of money would be if she signed a contract and we kept an itemized list of all the extra expenses I am taking on so that we can work out a payment plan when she starts earning more money again.  I am NOT adding interest onto anything.\n\nShe got mad at me because she feels like I am not trusting her.  But I'm just trying to protect a sizeable investment.  She is also mad that I will be keeping track of every additional cost I am taking on and expecting her to pay me back.  She thinks I should just be willing to pay more and to think of it as an investment in our future together since her getting a better job will benefit us both.  She's OK with paying back the cost of her program, but not the additional costs I will be paying because she's earning less.\n\nI told her this is a much better deal than she would get from anyone else, but if she wants to keep looking for different options or take a loan with a super high interest rate, she's free to do that as well.  She feels like I'm trying to make a profit off of her trying to better herself.  But honestly, I'm just thinking about breaking even.  \n\nWe've talked about getting married, but we aren't even engaged yet.  I do want to spend the rest of my life with her, but life happens and who knows for sure.  I'm just trying to protect myself, but she's taking this idea as a personal attack on her trustworthiness.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I got an arts degree too, and realized only after that I couldn\u2019t do a whole lot with it unless I wanted to get a PhD, which would take years.  I ended up going back to school for law because the field I wanted to work in wasn\u2019t as feasible in my country.\n\nI got lucky because when I did my arts degree my parents sat me down and made sure that I had a plan for what to do after if things didn\u2019t work out.

The rest is cold. They've been together 5 years and he doesn't think enough of her as a partner to help with daily expenses.", "So much this. I know of several cases when men put their girlfriends through school/university and got dumped right after graduation. You've gotta protect yourself.", "So? They've been together 5 years and he doesn't have an idea of when they might possibly get engaged. There are serious problems and the money is just revealing it.", "Asking a bunch of hypothetical questions can go both ways though.  What if she gets stressed from the program and stops working completely?  What if she hates the program and wants to drop out?  What if she breaks up with me right after she finishes the program?  Asking those questions doesn't do any good.", "Seems hard to believe given what I know my accountant friends make versus what my waitress friends do.", "If it were, I doubt he'd look down on her degree to the same extent!", "And blaming OP for not being supportive which will almost certainly end in a break up.", "No they're not, you're just supporting his girlfriend mooching off him while he's already paying the majority of expenses.", "No, because then we would probably have shared finances.  Right now our finances are completely separate.  IF we get married, or even engaged, before she pays me back, I would wipe it clean because then we are making a life-long commitment to each other.  But we aren't at that point yet.", "Agreed and vice versa - plenty of women stick with a guy through something demanding like med school thinking they\u2019ll mutually benefit but then he\u2019ll leave her and she gets nothing for putting her career on hold to support him. In general it\u2019s better not to treat money this way, it\u2019s a huge risk. That\u2019s why even married people can and should have prenups.", "100% this. When you level up your girl she usually leaves you for someone else. Nta", "You're missing the point of *that* commenters hypothetical ... you're already covering all of your questions that you countered with - with your contract. Now its time to talk about what would be expected of *you* if you could no longer provide financially ...", "Ikr? I wonder how much money he would need to pay if they actually share proportionately to income, like reasonable people do.", "Yeah, her resentment is sure no matter if she takes the loan or not.", "Nope.", "In that case, and assuming she is aware of this as well, I think your position is entirely reasonable, and I really don't understand why your gf is so upset.\n\nI also really don't understand how she thinks you would be \"making a profit\" off of her when you specifically said that you were *not* going to charge her interest \u2013 which *would* be a profit for you, but certainly not an unreasonable type for a lender to make. (Obviously, in that case, the amount of interest charged would have an impact on how reasonable or unreasonable you were being.)", "You're not at that point after 5 years? I'm not one to push marriage and in fact chose to not get married ro my long term partner, but after 5 years you should know where you stand together. It's strange that you are talking about her like you are just beginning to date.", "I already have my student loans paid off and have enough in savings to cover me for 6-months.  I also have long-term disability insurance to help with those kind of expenses if I can't work.  If, for whatever reason I couldn't work for an extended period, I have myself pretty well covered.", "We're barely in our mid 20s and are still clearly getting our lives figured out.", "Then why are you so obsessed with the idea of potentially spending an extra \"$5k over 9 months\"?   Based on your comments here, you make an adult salary, have no debt, and have healthy savings - $5k is pretty immaterial in this case. Seems or at least immature.  YTA.", "I'm in my mid 20s. You and her are way overdue for a serious talk about the future. You're making excuses and putting off a difficult conversation."]}
