We have 2 kids together (8 & 6).  My wife also has a daughter from a previous relationship, Liz, (16F).  My wife has primary custody of Liz so she lives with us the majority of the time and spends a couple weekends a month with her dad.  Liz and I have a pretty good relationship, but like any teenager, there are some battles.  \n\nA couple of months ago, Liz decided she wanted to switch to a plant-based diet.  That's not a problem in itself, but it has caused some issues.  For starters, the kind of food that Liz wants to eat is expensive.  When she first told us she wanted to do this, she had my wife take her to Whole Foods to get some food specifically for her.  I was shocked when I saw the receipt.  We don't live paycheck to paycheck, but I told my wife that we need to look at different options because we can't afford to get Liz that food all the time.\n\nSecond, I do all of the cooking for the family.  I work from home so it's easier for me to get dinner ready in the evening.  I'm not a great cook by any means and we get meal deliveries to help with recipes.  So when Liz started this diet, we told her we would get one plant-based meal in our deliveries.  \n\nBut the other nights of the week, I've been struggling to make 2 separate meals for everyone.  No one else in the family wants to eat what Liz is eating every night.  And not every meal is easy to make into a plant-based meal.  A handful of times I've messed up meals because I'm trying to do too much in the kitchen.\n\nI told my wife that we need to figure out a different plan because this one isn't working.  I said that Liz is old enough to learn to cook on her own and if she wants to eat something completely different than the rest of the family, she might have to cook it herself.  I also suggested getting plant-based frozen meals that Liz could heat up for herself.  \n\nMy wife didn't really like those ideas because she felt it would single Liz out and that we would be treating her differently than the other kids.  But she did at least agree to talk to Liz about it.  When we spoke to Liz, she was not a fan of those ideas either.  She said she hates frozen meals and that even the plant-based ones have bad ingredients in them.  She also said that she doesn't think it's fair that she has to cook for herself when everyone else has meals cooked for them.\n\nI asked Liz if she has any other ideas and she said that the whole family should just switch to her diet so that it's easier for me to cook for everyone.  I told her no right away.  I will support Liz with her dietary choices, but I won't have them forced on everyone else in the family. \n\nI told her that I don't have the time or ability to cook separate meals for her every night.  I said that if she wants to eat something different than everyone else, then she's going to have to be the one to make it happen.  Now both my wife and Liz think I'm being a jerk by being unfair and unsupportive.", "created_utc": 1674054320, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f9jdq/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_separate_meals_for_my/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd offer two solutions - either she eats what you cook, but you don't add meat ingredients until necessary and save her part to the side, or you give her whatever her share of the family grocery budget is. From here she can plan her own meals, purchase the ingredients, and cook. \n\nThis is great preparation for adulthood, because she'll learn how to budget, prepare meals, and also that we don't get to eat exactly what we want for every meal (unless you're rich).", "NAH.\n\nKid's 16, she's gonna boundary-push and be a little outrageous and self-important sometimes. That's a nornal part of teenage life. Irritating, sure, but not out of pocket.\n\nAnd as someone who often is primary food provider, it can be MAJORLY frustrating trying to accomodate multiple different diets. I've often been in situations where I've had a looong list of restrictions and preferences to deal with on top of my own outside-the-norm dietary needs.\n\nMy best advice is to start with meals where the protein can be easily swapped in and out, or assemble-your-own meals. Spaghetti with a roasted veg sauce where meatballs & cheese are added after serving, stirfry bowls with lots of veg options, tacos with pulled jackfruit as a protien alternative, falafel in place of fried chicken (fried before the chicken, of course). Things where you're only making one or two extra ingredients instead of whole meals.\n\nAnd pull your stepdaughter into meal prep with you. She's 16, she's old enough to learn how to chop veggies and preheat an oven and prep protein options. It'll take some pressure off of you, teach her how to cook both for herself and others, and be good bonding. :)", "NTA\nIf she wants a different diet she is old enough to cook and clean up.

Fruits, veggies, pasta, rice, potatoes all inexpensive compared to most meats.  That being said, your solution of her preparing for herself is reasonable.  She is 16, making a berry and apple salad with vinaigrette dressing is simple, cheap, fast and delicious.  Oatmeal with almond milk, etc. etc.  My son is vegan, he says the trick is to buy vegan options that are NOT in the marked up vegan section.  Also consider including meals that are easy to make both ways, for example pasta with marinara.  You could easily make her a portion without protein in a different pan.  Not 2 meals but one meal in 2 pans.  Op is NTA.", "Nta Liz is 16 and old enough to actually work for her morals/principals.  She can learn to batch cook on the weekend and plate up individual portions for the week.  \n\nI would say one a week, the family can go meat free.  Pasta with red sauce or Alfredo is meat free.  Pizza can be meat free.", "NTA\n\nYou are the chef in the house, so you set the rules n everyone else must follow. Kids can follow whatever diet they want outside", "Honest question: how come you can't make a single meal, separate the proteins, and then add in the protein of choice?\n\nA single pot of vegetarian spaghetti sauce, then after it's done cooking,. split out her portion, add in sme TVP or firm tofu or beans and the. For you add in your meat and cheese. Minimizes the extra work and the resentment because everyone's eating the same foods.\n\nAlso - a plant based diet done right is cheaper by FAR than meat. Go to a bulk food store instead of trendy bs places. You can get TVP, pulses, legumes and plant based protein powder at a bulk barn for a fraction of what they'll charge at Whole Foods - and it's usually the same brand or supplier. Plus an ordinary supermarket will have tofu for a reasonable price. Failing that - try an Asian grocery. \n\nI'm not even vegetarian but I get my plant based protein there. I eat plant based 4 days a week for health reasons. Trust me when I say my plant based meals are miles cheaper than the meat based ones. Usually they're less than half the cost. \n\nOn a related note: Liz probably should be helping with food prep more. Maybe she cooks once a week for everyone?

You also can't say you are treating her differently from your other kids since they are way younger and when she was their age you didn't ask her to cook. My child is 12 and can make himself eggs and warm tortillas and bake cookies on his own, im sure a 16 can learn to make her own meals if she doesn't like whats being offered.

Your daughter can be responsible for her own main the other days.", "NAH i think you already doing good seeking compromises. I think you could cook 2 plantbased meals for everyone (i mean many meals are naturally plantbased and dont need expensive surrogates) 2-3 times you could cook meals where a vegan alternative is easy to do (exchange meat with alternatives for her) an the rest of the time she was to eat frozen meals or cool herself. i think its also a good idea to encourage her cooking but i think then it would be a nice thing if she cooks plantbased for all of you.", "NTA. She's asking to be both treated differently (having a plant-based diet) and not differently (having you still cook her meals). She doesn't get it both ways. 16 is more than old enough to cook.

Doing this weekly if you have the freezer space means shell have a variety.

Think about teenagers going out w friends or getting takeout acouple times a week and he's making a vegetarian meal once a week. 3-4 meals may be what she eats at home. It's also unfair to force others to eat vegetarian, especially the younger kids. \n\nIt might not be necessary to eat meat at every meal but it isn't necessary to go meatless at the behest of a child when the family eats meat.\n\nWhole Foods isn't a budget store. You're making decisions for yourself and choosing what type of food to eat. \n\nHe doesn't need to make 2 meals. He can make one weekly meatless and 16 can learn to cook."]}
