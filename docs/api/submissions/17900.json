I breath in and exhale a portion of it and the neighbours can smell it.\n\nedit: typo", "It's actually defined as tobacco smoke exhaled by someone else (I googled out of curiosity). Not arguing for or against either thing (although out of interest would you be as upset about someone smoking cigarettes on their porch, which is also legal?) but I thought it was an interesting point as someone  brought up in another comment that second hand smoke doesn't include other types of smoke and apparently the actual definition only refers to tobacco.", "You realize BBQ smoke has a large amount of carcinogens in it yea\u2026.?

There must be no harmful effects for second hand marijuana smoke because you can breathe in bbq smoke just fine /s", "That's not what I said.

You don't have to like it or agree with it but you can get over it.", "NTA. But take care to protect yourself. Try to avoid the neighbor being able to see you. Get a privacy fence, tall plant etc.", "Definitely NTA, but a strange idea; could you get a standard desk fan, lay it on its back facing upwards on the side your neighbours are, and have it on when you smoke? Then it would blow any drifting smoke upwards rather than letting it drift over to their side. He would still see you sitting there Smoking, but it would possibly stop the smell drifting over?

If he\u2019s annoyed by the sight of you doing it when the kids aren\u2019t even outside then it\u2019s just his own personal bias.

Bet he wouldn't mind then. You offered to mitigate the impact, wtf do they really expect?", "Anyone on here trying to say that OP is the AH because of some perceived health risk for the children, clearly don\u2019t know much about marijuana smoke. The second hand smoke isn\u2019t gonna get these kids high unless they\u2019re literally in the same room as the person smoking it. From what I can tell, OP is a whole backyard away from these kids and doesn\u2019t smoke when they\u2019re outside. If you just simply don\u2019t like the smell of weed then idk what to tell you but OP is definitely NTA", "NAH I'd say.\n\nFor some, it can be an incredibly obnoxious scent and it's understandable to want to protect your kids from it and develop an emotional reaction from the persisting situation. However it's also understandable to want to continue this habit for your own reasons in your own space and you are well within your rights.\n\nThere are however several methods you could employ to cover both the smoke trail and the scent so you could continue smoking weed there and also take a considerate action towards your neighbour. \n\nAs a quick example, dry-herb vaporisers do a good job of this and they are fairly cheap to buy nowadays. Plus - in my opinion - it makes for a slightly nicer experience in regard to taste and also reducing the harshness of the smoke inhalation.", "NTA. The double standard is *chef kiss*. He\u2019s allowed to get drunk and loud with his friends in the backyard, regardless of how safe that is for his kids. And he gets pissy with you for sparking up in your own back yard.", "NTA. It\u2019s not 20-30yrs ago. Weed is perfectly ok now. Especially if you have anxiety, it\u2019s really helping you relax. Especially if you have to deal with a stressful work week.

You handled this much more polite than I would have.", "NTA.

The wife seem possibly more reasonable to compromise with.\n\nYou are well within your right to smoke outdoors in your garden. It's one of those inconveniences people have to tolerate. Same with noises, grill smoke and cigarettes. As long as it's normal, of course.

I'll say NTA... but I'd also encourage you to look at alternatives like vape or gummies.  I get it, I like flower, but I know flower can stink for people.  They are a small family just wanting to have use of their backyard with their kids.  I can totally understand where they are coming from.

Source: I\u2019ve done both for long periods of time. Smoking is actually easier to monitor your high because it affects you faster, even though the high itself happens little by little. Basically, you\u2019re ingesting a smaller amount of weed when you smoke, so the way it affects you quicker means you can pretty accurately judge how much more you need to be a comfortable high. For someone who doesn\u2019t smoke, I\u2019d compare this experience to drinking beer or wine. It\u2019s a low enough alcohol content that you can pretty easily monitor how drunk you get.\n\nHowever with edibles, it\u2019s a fixed amount and it takes longer to have an effect. So once you take too much, you won\u2019t realize it until 30 mins - an hour later and you can\u2019t go back. The high from edibles I have noticed also hits you in an \u201call at once\u201d sort of way. For someone who took too strong of an edible for them, this can feel extremely scary. I have had this happen a lot when I was younger and dumber, and didn\u2019t know the correct dosage for my own body/tolerance. I\u2019d compare this to taking shots of vodka. You can take the shot and feel fine after the initial burn/discomfort of the shot going down, but after a few minutes you will feel SIGNIFICANTLY drunker than before. That sudden wave of \u201cI\u2019m now way too drunk\u201d is what taking edibles can feel like to someone who isn\u2019t experienced with edibles. \n\nAnyway long story short, edibles aren\u2019t a quick fix to someone who is bothering others with the smell of weed smoke. They are a different concentration/formulation of the same drug, and have different effects. My friend has switched from smoking joints to a dab pen, which has pretty much no detectable weed smell even though it is more concentrated (straight up thc oil). That can be a solution, although dab pens come with a different set of risks as well as a different overall experience, similarly to edibles.", "Different people can react differently to smoking vs edibles. I have a friend that can smoke all day and be pleasantly high but one edible makes them sick/paranoid.", "Some people are immune to edibles. Their bodies digest the edible before the THC can get into the body. I\u2019ve got 500mg edibles before (5mg is the normal amount) and felt nothing besides faint droopy eyes. I\u2019ve also used RSO oil which is a super powerful THC concentration and still didn\u2019t get high. The only way I can get high on weed is smoking.", "edibles are a wild card and you really can\u2019t be sure how they\u2019ll affect you until it hits.

It's better for you, it doesn't smell, etc. But it just doesn't do anything for me. I can feel my anxiety decrease from one hit, but can't feel anything after eating an entire bag of edibles.\n\nI really hate to annoy my neighbors with the smell and I do feel bad about it.
