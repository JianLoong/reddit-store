This is what I do too. \u201cCigarettes are so gross, only unhealthy people would smoke them.\u201d Then when weed became legal \u201cthat\u2019s marijuana, it\u2019s kind of like cigarettes, ugh.\u201d Works like a charm.", "You conveniently left out the first part where I said \u201csecond hand smoke\u201d, which is specifically smoke exhaled by someone else.", "I said regardless of what kind of \u201csecond hand smoke\u201d. So cigarettes, or weed, or vapes. \n\nA BBQ is not second hand smoke.", "From the first article: \u201cStudies show that when you are around someone who is smoking marijuana, the smoke gets into your system too. How much of it gets in depends on how close the person is, how many people are smoking and how much, how long you spend near them, and how much ventilation there is in the space\u201d \n\nOP is outside which means the smoke is clearly quite ventilated, and is not close to kids as he\u2019s on his own deck which is 20ish yards away. Meaning, there isn\u2019t impacting these kids and as OP has said, he makes an effort not to smoke when the kids are there. \n\nYeesh bro, you gotta smoke some weed and chill.", "English is not my first language but by your logic, technically, if I stand around a bbq and breath, that's second hand smoke, innit? I breath in and exhale a portion of it and the neighbours can smell it.\n\nedit: typo", "It's actually defined as tobacco smoke exhaled by someone else (I googled out of curiosity). Not arguing for or against either thing (although out of interest would you be as upset about someone smoking cigarettes on their porch, which is also legal?) but I thought it was an interesting point as someone  brought up in another comment that second hand smoke doesn't include other types of smoke and apparently the actual definition only refers to tobacco.", "You realize BBQ smoke has a large amount of carcinogens in it yea\u2026.? So yea\u2026. Inhaling smoke from any burning substance is infact second hand smoke and has a deleterious effect on one\u2019s lungs?", "I'm just messing with you tho, I couldn't give a shit about any of this.", "Oh wow yeah you got me, my entirely point has been completely demolished! There must be no harmful effects for second hand marijuana smoke because you can breathe in bbq smoke just fine /s", "That's not what I said. But I'm starting to realise that I'm not gonna have a proper conversation with you so Im just gonna leave it."]}
