No I just meant, maybe, they don't want their kids going out to play when you are smoking weed, rather than letting them out then you stop sort of thing.

It is reasonable to want to protect your children from exposure to smoke.  It is understandable if you don't want the stench to accumulate in your home, and choose to smoke outside where the smell will (eventually) dissipate.  It is hypocritical of your neighbor to care only about this, but expose his children to other neighbors smoking tobacco, and his guests drinking.  IF he does.  It is disingenuous of you to expect your neighbors to willingly accept something you yourself find undesirable inside your own home, IF that is why you are outside.\n\nYou could try some creative problem solving so your relationship improves.
