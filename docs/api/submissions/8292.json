I understand as an atheist you feel covering your arms goes against your beliefs, and I respect that. You will be missed on the day.* \n\nShe's being ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA. It's basic courtesy to follow dress expectations at special events like weddings. I left the church I grew up in but occasionally attend while visiting my parents, and I wear what they consider modest. When I visited St. Peter's Basilica, I put on a cardigan because covering shoulders is required. You're not telling her to change how she dresses all the time, just at this one event. \n\nI'm sorry your friend seems to be putting her feelings about clothes over your friendship.", "NTA.

Weddings are to celebrate the couple, and that includes celebrating and honoring their culture.\n\nCongrats on your upcoming wedding!!!", "NTA - As an atheist this is bs. I would respect whatever customs my friends practice and especially on a special day such as this. You\u2019re not being a bridezilla, please don\u2019t let Ellie make you feel like you are one. She is trying to make this about her for whatever reason, jealousy maybe? Seems extremely selfish and not something a friend would do.

It's a wedding. Weddings have dress codes. And it's in a masjid, which presumably has its own dress code. Many cultures and countries will not admit you into a house of worship if you're dressed inappropriately. Moreover, weddings are allowed to have dress codes. That's not singling anyone out. \n\nI'm an atheist too, but I still put on slacks to go see St. Peter's Basilica and other churches in Italy.

If she can't wear a cardigan and floor length dress or a suit to your wedding she clearly doesn't respect you enough to deserve a seat in the event.", "NTA.  Being an atheist is irrelevant.  She wants to attend a religious service, and of course she has to conform to the faith's dictates about dress whilst doing so.", "NTA\n\nThis is what you and your place of worship is asking for, if it was just for your preference then I would possibly say maybe not be so strict but your wedding venue also requires this type of dress. So your friend can either adjust or not go. Her decision.", "NTA. A religious venue has a dress code. It\u2019s not really upto you but you want to be respectful of it. Also friends should support each others beliefs on the one day where it\u2019s about celebrating them (the couple get married). Your friend is the AH. You\u2019re fine.", "NTA. \n\nYou have a right to be respected on your wedding day. She is stating that you caving in the her unnecessary Want is more important than being a good friend to you.", "NTA. How rude of her to make your wedding all about her attire. Surely she can follow a reasonable dress code for one event.", "NTA. Based on your other comments you aren't asking anything excessive. You are simply asking her to respect your traditions and belief and respect the sanctity of the space where your wedding will take place. It's a simple to comply with request and it isn't unique to Islam. Many religions ask visitors to dress modestly when visiting their sacred spaces.  It's respectful and not hard to comply with. If she doesn't like it she doesn't have to pretend.", "NTA. When in a religious space, you respect the culture. Point blank.", "Nta", "NTA You're not, it's your wedding. She can play by the rules you and fiancee and set for it or she can not play at all.\n\nIt's not like you're asking her to do anything outrageous.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a bridezilla request to ask someone to respect a place of religious worship and ceremony.\n\nI\u2019m a strong atheist myself, and I always ensure I am appropriately dressed if I\u2019m entering a place of worship, because it\u2019s the respectful thing to do.\n\nShe\u2019s making a fuss over nothing. Covering her skin in modest clothing for one event isn\u2019t going to hurt her. \n\nShe can be atheist, and still respect you as a person, can\u2019t she? Even if she doesn\u2019t agree with religious practices, you think she\u2019d accept the scenario because you are friends.", "NTA. Your wedding, your call. You have every right whoever to invite it and how you want the wedding to be. I don't have the same religion as you but I got married. Your friend is the AH for making it about her.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m a complete atheist. Travelled through Turkey and went in at least 15 Mosques. Wore head covering, top and skirt to the floor each and every time. \n\nYou respect I\u2019m atheist and I will respect your rules in your place of religion! It\u2019s quite simple", "NTA. At this point you\u2019d be better off officially uninviting her. No good friend would cause all this extra stress and drama over a reasonable dress code due to religious reasons. She can have a problem with it and not attend, but to say she\u2019s going to wear whatever she wants anyways then trying to get friends on her side is doing too much. Cut your ties sooner rather than later so it\u2019s a distant memory by the time your wedding comes.", "NTA. It\u2019s a place of worship. I went to a mosque once for a school event (long story) and we all covered our hair with scarves, etc, even though none of us were Muslim. It\u2019s out of respect for the religion being practices there whether you personally agree with their practices or not", "NTA, it\u00b4 is your wedding and it is ok to want to inspire a respectful environment for all of your guests. If it is going to be a religious event, any sane person with common sense will expect formal wear, maybe not a dress code, but surely something appropriate.\n\nNow, if she\u00b4 is having so much of an issue with a simple dress code, you may need to ask yourself if she is pissed or upset about something, since sounds like she is clearly going to dress like a ho to get on your nerves. Since atheism is not an excuse to dress inappropriately.", "I\u2019m an atheist and I truly don\u2019t understand your friend. Why is she trying to make your ceremony all about her? It is not about her. Your requests are not even remotely unreasonable. If she can\u2019t respect you, your spouse, your culture, or your faith, she shouldn\u2019t be there. \n\nI hope you have a lovely wedding.", "NTA. You're not being a bridezilla, Ellie's just being an AH. Be it a  mosque, church, synagogue or even work, there are certain dress code expectations, both spoken and unspoken. Ellie needs to get it through her thick skull that A) this wedding is not about her and B) even as adults we are expected to follow the rules. \n\nLet her raise a stink over it. All she's doing is making it obvious to people that she is a self-centered, immature brat who can't handle one simple request: dress for occasion and the venue.", "I couldn\u2019t go in St Marks Cathedral in Venice because I didn\u2019t have sleeves on my top.  Some places still require a man to wear a coat and tie for dinner. There are rules and it\u2019s just respectful to follow the rules of the facility you\u2019re in.  Your \u201cfriend\u201d has no respect for you.  I would uninvite her. NTA", "NTA. Its the same as, more important in your case because of your faith, a lot of other weddings where only the bride wears white. No one else wears white out of respect for the bride and i guarantee she hasnt gone against that. Wearing a dress with long sleeves or a blouse or long dress or whatever is required to be modest is not that hard to do. Especially if your close longtime friends", "NTA - If she has a problem with the dress code, she can decline to attend, which she is free to do. \n\nYour request was straight to the point and explained why, if your friend decided she wasn\u2019t comfortable with that then she should\u2019ve declined or offered to celebrate with your later on. But it sounds like she\u2019s not a real friend for trying to shame you for your beliefs.", "At this point I'd tell her to do whatever she likes and let the venue turn her away so she can see this is bigger than just your wedding she'd be disrespecting.  It's the whole concept that houses of worship ask you to respect their modesty requirements. If she isn't aware of that widely-known practice, and won't listen to you politely trying to explain it to her, let her embarrassed herself when she sees others frown on her behaviour.", "Oh good Lordt (or not). She's just being a pill and making your day all about her. I dressed modestly through all of the monasteries and churches I visited in Greece at the height of summer. She can handle one day to honor her friend. And if she can't? She isn't a friend. Tbh, agree just looking to start drama here, which I wouldn't be surprised if that was her MO on the regular anyways. NTA, OPA, and good luck.", "Nta. I am am atheist. She is being ridiculous. It sounds like you may have outgrown the friendship.", "NTA. I understand why women get in a twist about these kinds of dress codes, but she needs to take a stand on her own dime. Your wedding is not her platform.", "NTA.", "NTA. She needs to understand that your wedding is not about her wearing whatever she wants. It\u2019s about understanding and respecting other\u2019s beliefs. But if she already knows the date/time/location of your wedding, maybe have someone there to keep her out of she show up dressed inappropriately for the venue/service.", "NTA\n\nIt's not really any different than a dress code anywhere else. Don't like it? Don't go there.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding. In your case, it\u2019s also a practice of your faith. It\u2019s 100% inappropriate to dress immodestly at a religious event.", "NTA. Religious venues have dress codes \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of respect. I\u2019m agnostic, my husband is Jewish, I have friends of varying religions. When I go to a masjid, I dress modestly and cover my hair \u2014 it\u2019s both required and the respectful thing to do. I dress modestly at most churches and synagogues, too! What world does your friend live in???", "NTA\n\nYou are not being a bridezilla. Ellie is being disrespectful towards your culture. \n\nYou clearly specified the dress code. She is free not to be ok with it and decline the invitation because of it (that would be understandable). However coming there \"dressed as she wants\" is unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nYou respect her being atheist all these years right?\n\nShe can choose to respect your religion, and your right to it. Or she can impose her views and decide not to attend.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to ask others to change their beliefs for her. That\u2019s insane to me, especially coming from an atheist (most atheists hate religion because it imposes a belief on to others don\u2019t they?).\n\nSucks your friend is a D, I\u2019d ask her in the group chat simply \u2018can you attend with the dress code or do you prefer to rsvp No?\u2019 (Don\u2019t explain or engage in her accusations.)\n\nNobody is forcing her either way, and she can choose to not attend doesn\u2019t mean you excluded her. It\u2019s freedom of choice.\n\nImho she\u2019s trying to prove Islam oppressed women by stating she has to be allowed to come as she wants - and forcing you to say no. It\u2019s very twisted. Don\u2019t play into it. She\u2019s been invited, that\u2019s inclusion. Everything after is drama\u2026she\u2019s acting like you asked her to convert lol\n\nI\u2019m not Muslim, my family is orthodox Christian, I cover up in our church (even when touring and not during mass), out of respect for where I am. I\u2019m not oppressed, at home I\u2019m agnostic and freethinking. Not been to church since 11, my parents let me choose. But I still respect the customs of others. That\u2019s basic human decency I\u2019d say", "Same as several other people who have commented: I'm an atheist who is totally okay with complying with \"modest dress\" rules in a house of worship. It's basically just good manners and generally accepted etiquette. I'm not sure why anyone would find this request to be offensive.", "My boyfriend and I went to a funeral for a friend of ours who\u2019s family is Buddhist. We didn\u2019t know it was going to be at a Temple so I went with normal school age girl clothes and wore a knee length skirt. I felt so embarrassed walking out into the living getting told that my dress wasn\u2019t appropriate. Luckily it was easy to put a long skirt overtop. You\u2019re an asshole is you\u2019re not respectful to other religions when you are in their holy place.", "NTA It doesn\u2019t take much to be respectful, but for some it\u2019s damn near impossible to do.", "NTA- personally I disagree with modesty dress codes but I wouldn\u2019t show up somewhere to a private function wearing something out of synch with the expected dress. If your friend has that much of a problem with the dress code she should politely decline to attend. She\u2019s out of line.", "NTA, this is not a personal vendetta against her. It is a request of all guests for religious reasons. If she can't respect that, regardless of her beliefs, then that's on her. The wedding is not about her.", "NTA. Religious venues often have dress codes. Even Kate Middleton's wedding venue (Westminster Abbey) had a dress code and she and her guests had to obey it.\n\nEllie is just using this event to make some anti-religion BS stand.", "No because it's your wedding. In the west sometimes brides dress the bridesmaids up in a uniformed color or even rather homely to flatter themselves more.I've seen some oogly dresses they pick out for them.  If the bride says wear this they wear that. Sometimes they even tell the men, but men may or may not listen. Wear a tuxedo FINE, not tucking the shirt in though lol. Younger men mostly, but it happens. \n\n You just have all of your differences and feelings on social happenings concerning that bubbling up as argument which is what all the heat is about and the basic fact that it's your wedding to host and she is a guest is being glossed over. \n\n Ask her to please stick with that consideration, it's your wedding, you want it to be a certain way and you'd like her to be a part of it. Tell her during her wedding you'd do the same. Beach wedding bikini attire, cool. It's not ideological warfare here, it's personal tastes on an important personal day. Your pursuit of happiness here is not the pursuit of her misery. You'd like her to be a part of it and if it's too big an ask for a friend to not even bend over backwards but bend a little then you think that's hurtful because you'd bend for her on her day.\n\nI'd focus on that element of it hoping there can be common ground there because the rest of it is a wasps nest.", "NTA.

That's not a stupid reason.   She wants to ignore the restriction because she believes her atheism trumps the venue's restriction.  \n \nThat's not you having an agenda because of her atheism, that's her having an agenda because of the venue's restrictions.\n\nUninvite her from the ceremony and she's welcome at the reception.", "Info: when you say dress modestly, does that include covering the head? \n\nI can see why she would be uncomfortable with that.

I would probably go with NTA, because this is your wedding, not hers, she can dress how she wants at hers, but as long as it\u2019s yours she should comply to what you want as long as it\u2019s not completely unreasonable. Anyways, congratulations on getting married!", "NTA, when a guest in a religious building you have to follow the dress code, that\u2019s just being polite.

Important enough that it has been enshrined in the Bill of Rights. \n\nInterpretation of what is a \u201cwell-regulated militia\u201d has been contentious for a long time and I\u2019m not weighing in on that part here.", "OH! the bears are fighting themselves!\n\nSo, I dont have to worry about stealth drop bears falling out of the sky with sharpened pic-a-nic baskets?", "You're missing the point of the discussion.

I would not be surprised if there are renegade mosques that go out of their way to bend the rules in order to be more welcoming.

We're supposed to have confessed and dealt with any sins against a brother before taking communion.", "I get where she\u2019s coming from and I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable wearing one either. A wig has other uses for a non-Jewish woman, but _in this situation_, it\u2019s explicitly a religious item. It\u2019s the difference between wearing a small cap and a kippah, just not as visually distinct. It\u2019s different than just a requirement to wear something, anything, over a body part that that location requires to be covered for modesty standards, even if that standard is religious based, which is what a head scarf is. There are explicitly religious styles of head scarves that I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable wearing either, though a plain head scarf is non-denominational.", "Even then, from my experience unless it is a very strict mosque, wearing a hijab for non Muslim women is usually just wear a scarf over your head. It does not have to meet Muslim women standard.

I can respect that.", "Returning citizens", "that would depend on denomination, I grew up Protestant and confession was never a thing in any of the churches I attended, mostly Presbyterian and United.\n\nETA I just reread your comment and realized I misunderstood. Yes you're right, I was interpreting it as confession to a Minister or Priest like in Catholicism but I realize that you didn't mean that. Sorry!", "Old school catholic want you to cover the head too -mantillas- but the story no longer a requirement. Shoulders and knees are still on the covering list.", "u/ksiyoto you would have loved a friend of my family who was an Orthodox rabbi. My own family, for the record, is not Orthodox, did not attend his synagogue, and at the time of this story I was an angry teenaged agnostic. I was in hospital for several months because of serious illness, and my own congregational rabbi didn't even bother to visit. But this man, a deeply religious scholarly type, with the typical long beard, etc., not only showed up to spend time with me when it was not part of his job, but the first thing he said to me was, \"I am not here to talk about religion or anything like that. You're a friend of my kids, and I know being in the hospital is really hard, and lonely. I just thought maybe you could use some company. We can talk about whatever you want, or nothing at all.\" And he just sat with me.

I should probably lose the f * ck too LOL\nedited for formatting", "I love that! Reminds me of my childhood rabbi. One time my mom was in the hospital to have a lump removed from her breast, and the nurse had set her up with a compress to put on the incision, but she had to hold it on. Just then, our rabbi popped in for a surprise visit! My mom was flustered, and trying to quickly cover up, because our rabbi walked in on her grabbing her boob! But without missing a beat, the rabbi said, \"That's ok, everyone needs a hobby.\"", "Yeah my dad used to tell me stories of when he was in Scotland & the first time he ever heard the term f@g, he almost punched the dude lol he said he was in a bar, & someone came up asking (I'm prolly spelling this WAAAYYYY wrong lol)  \"geez a f@g?\" My dad turned around fully prepared to throw hands, but dude was holding out a cigarette & my dad realized he had JUST asked someone for a smoke.
