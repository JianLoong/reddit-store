I understand as an atheist you feel covering your arms goes against your beliefs, and I respect that. You will be missed on the day.* \n\nShe's being ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA. It's basic courtesy to follow dress expectations at special events like weddings. I left the church I grew up in but occasionally attend while visiting my parents, and I wear what they consider modest. When I visited St. Peter's Basilica, I put on a cardigan because covering shoulders is required. You're not telling her to change how she dresses all the time, just at this one event. \n\nI'm sorry your friend seems to be putting her feelings about clothes over your friendship.", "NTA.

Weddings are to celebrate the couple, and that includes celebrating and honoring their culture.\n\nCongrats on your upcoming wedding!!!", "NTA - As an atheist this is bs. I would respect whatever customs my friends practice and especially on a special day such as this. You\u2019re not being a bridezilla, please don\u2019t let Ellie make you feel like you are one. She is trying to make this about her for whatever reason, jealousy maybe? Seems extremely selfish and not something a friend would do.

It's a wedding. Weddings have dress codes. And it's in a masjid, which presumably has its own dress code. Many cultures and countries will not admit you into a house of worship if you're dressed inappropriately. Moreover, weddings are allowed to have dress codes. That's not singling anyone out. \n\nI'm an atheist too, but I still put on slacks to go see St. Peter's Basilica and other churches in Italy.

If she can't wear a cardigan and floor length dress or a suit to your wedding she clearly doesn't respect you enough to deserve a seat in the event.", "NTA.  Being an atheist is irrelevant.  She wants to attend a religious service, and of course she has to conform to the faith's dictates about dress whilst doing so.", "NTA\n\nThis is what you and your place of worship is asking for, if it was just for your preference then I would possibly say maybe not be so strict but your wedding venue also requires this type of dress. So your friend can either adjust or not go. Her decision.", "NTA. A religious venue has a dress code. It\u2019s not really upto you but you want to be respectful of it. Also friends should support each others beliefs on the one day where it\u2019s about celebrating them (the couple get married). Your friend is the AH. You\u2019re fine.", "NTA. \n\nYou have a right to be respected on your wedding day. She is stating that you caving in the her unnecessary Want is more important than being a good friend to you.", "NTA. How rude of her to make your wedding all about her attire. Surely she can follow a reasonable dress code for one event.", "NTA. Based on your other comments you aren't asking anything excessive. You are simply asking her to respect your traditions and belief and respect the sanctity of the space where your wedding will take place. It's a simple to comply with request and it isn't unique to Islam. Many religions ask visitors to dress modestly when visiting their sacred spaces.  It's respectful and not hard to comply with. If she doesn't like it she doesn't have to pretend.", "NTA. When in a religious space, you respect the culture. Point blank.", "Nta", "NTA You're not, it's your wedding. She can play by the rules you and fiancee and set for it or she can not play at all.\n\nIt's not like you're asking her to do anything outrageous.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a bridezilla request to ask someone to respect a place of religious worship and ceremony.\n\nI\u2019m a strong atheist myself, and I always ensure I am appropriately dressed if I\u2019m entering a place of worship, because it\u2019s the respectful thing to do.\n\nShe\u2019s making a fuss over nothing. Covering her skin in modest clothing for one event isn\u2019t going to hurt her. \n\nShe can be atheist, and still respect you as a person, can\u2019t she? Even if she doesn\u2019t agree with religious practices, you think she\u2019d accept the scenario because you are friends.", "NTA. Your wedding, your call. You have every right whoever to invite it and how you want the wedding to be. I don't have the same religion as you but I got married. Your friend is the AH for making it about her.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m a complete atheist. Travelled through Turkey and went in at least 15 Mosques. Wore head covering, top and skirt to the floor each and every time. \n\nYou respect I\u2019m atheist and I will respect your rules in your place of religion! It\u2019s quite simple", "NTA. At this point you\u2019d be better off officially uninviting her. No good friend would cause all this extra stress and drama over a reasonable dress code due to religious reasons. She can have a problem with it and not attend, but to say she\u2019s going to wear whatever she wants anyways then trying to get friends on her side is doing too much. Cut your ties sooner rather than later so it\u2019s a distant memory by the time your wedding comes.", "NTA. It\u2019s a place of worship. I went to a mosque once for a school event (long story) and we all covered our hair with scarves, etc, even though none of us were Muslim. It\u2019s out of respect for the religion being practices there whether you personally agree with their practices or not", "NTA, it\u00b4 is your wedding and it is ok to want to inspire a respectful environment for all of your guests. If it is going to be a religious event, any sane person with common sense will expect formal wear, maybe not a dress code, but surely something appropriate.\n\nNow, if she\u00b4 is having so much of an issue with a simple dress code, you may need to ask yourself if she is pissed or upset about something, since sounds like she is clearly going to dress like a ho to get on your nerves. Since atheism is not an excuse to dress inappropriately.", "I\u2019m an atheist and I truly don\u2019t understand your friend. Why is she trying to make your ceremony all about her? It is not about her. Your requests are not even remotely unreasonable. If she can\u2019t respect you, your spouse, your culture, or your faith, she shouldn\u2019t be there. \n\nI hope you have a lovely wedding.", "NTA. You're not being a bridezilla, Ellie's just being an AH. Be it a  mosque, church, synagogue or even work, there are certain dress code expectations, both spoken and unspoken. Ellie needs to get it through her thick skull that A) this wedding is not about her and B) even as adults we are expected to follow the rules. \n\nLet her raise a stink over it. All she's doing is making it obvious to people that she is a self-centered, immature brat who can't handle one simple request: dress for occasion and the venue.", "I couldn\u2019t go in St Marks Cathedral in Venice because I didn\u2019t have sleeves on my top.  Some places still require a man to wear a coat and tie for dinner. There are rules and it\u2019s just respectful to follow the rules of the facility you\u2019re in.  Your \u201cfriend\u201d has no respect for you.  I would uninvite her. NTA", "NTA. Its the same as, more important in your case because of your faith, a lot of other weddings where only the bride wears white. No one else wears white out of respect for the bride and i guarantee she hasnt gone against that. Wearing a dress with long sleeves or a blouse or long dress or whatever is required to be modest is not that hard to do. Especially if your close longtime friends", "NTA - If she has a problem with the dress code, she can decline to attend, which she is free to do. \n\nYour request was straight to the point and explained why, if your friend decided she wasn\u2019t comfortable with that then she should\u2019ve declined or offered to celebrate with your later on. But it sounds like she\u2019s not a real friend for trying to shame you for your beliefs.", "At this point I'd tell her to do whatever she likes and let the venue turn her away so she can see this is bigger than just your wedding she'd be disrespecting.  It's the whole concept that houses of worship ask you to respect their modesty requirements. If she isn't aware of that widely-known practice, and won't listen to you politely trying to explain it to her, let her embarrassed herself when she sees others frown on her behaviour.", "Oh good Lordt (or not). She's just being a pill and making your day all about her. I dressed modestly through all of the monasteries and churches I visited in Greece at the height of summer. She can handle one day to honor her friend. And if she can't? She isn't a friend. Tbh, agree just looking to start drama here, which I wouldn't be surprised if that was her MO on the regular anyways. NTA, OPA, and good luck.", "Nta. I am am atheist. She is being ridiculous. It sounds like you may have outgrown the friendship.", "NTA. I understand why women get in a twist about these kinds of dress codes, but she needs to take a stand on her own dime. Your wedding is not her platform.", "NTA.", "NTA. She needs to understand that your wedding is not about her wearing whatever she wants. It\u2019s about understanding and respecting other\u2019s beliefs. But if she already knows the date/time/location of your wedding, maybe have someone there to keep her out of she show up dressed inappropriately for the venue/service.", "NTA\n\nIt's not really any different than a dress code anywhere else. Don't like it? Don't go there.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding. In your case, it\u2019s also a practice of your faith. It\u2019s 100% inappropriate to dress immodestly at a religious event.", "NTA. Religious venues have dress codes \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of respect. I\u2019m agnostic, my husband is Jewish, I have friends of varying religions. When I go to a masjid, I dress modestly and cover my hair \u2014 it\u2019s both required and the respectful thing to do. I dress modestly at most churches and synagogues, too! What world does your friend live in???", "NTA\n\nYou are not being a bridezilla. Ellie is being disrespectful towards your culture. \n\nYou clearly specified the dress code. She is free not to be ok with it and decline the invitation because of it (that would be understandable). However coming there \"dressed as she wants\" is unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nYou respect her being atheist all these years right?\n\nShe can choose to respect your religion, and your right to it. Or she can impose her views and decide not to attend.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to ask others to change their beliefs for her. That\u2019s insane to me, especially coming from an atheist (most atheists hate religion because it imposes a belief on to others don\u2019t they?).\n\nSucks your friend is a D, I\u2019d ask her in the group chat simply \u2018can you attend with the dress code or do you prefer to rsvp No?\u2019 (Don\u2019t explain or engage in her accusations.)\n\nNobody is forcing her either way, and she can choose to not attend doesn\u2019t mean you excluded her. It\u2019s freedom of choice.\n\nImho she\u2019s trying to prove Islam oppressed women by stating she has to be allowed to come as she wants - and forcing you to say no. It\u2019s very twisted. Don\u2019t play into it. She\u2019s been invited, that\u2019s inclusion. Everything after is drama\u2026she\u2019s acting like you asked her to convert lol\n\nI\u2019m not Muslim, my family is orthodox Christian, I cover up in our church (even when touring and not during mass), out of respect for where I am. I\u2019m not oppressed, at home I\u2019m agnostic and freethinking. Not been to church since 11, my parents let me choose. But I still respect the customs of others. That\u2019s basic human decency I\u2019d say", "Same as several other people who have commented: I'm an atheist who is totally okay with complying with \"modest dress\" rules in a house of worship. It's basically just good manners and generally accepted etiquette. I'm not sure why anyone would find this request to be offensive.", "My boyfriend and I went to a funeral for a friend of ours who\u2019s family is Buddhist. We didn\u2019t know it was going to be at a Temple so I went with normal school age girl clothes and wore a knee length skirt. I felt so embarrassed walking out into the living getting told that my dress wasn\u2019t appropriate. Luckily it was easy to put a long skirt overtop. You\u2019re an asshole is you\u2019re not respectful to other religions when you are in their holy place.", "NTA It doesn\u2019t take much to be respectful, but for some it\u2019s damn near impossible to do.", "NTA- personally I disagree with modesty dress codes but I wouldn\u2019t show up somewhere to a private function wearing something out of synch with the expected dress. If your friend has that much of a problem with the dress code she should politely decline to attend. She\u2019s out of line.", "NTA, this is not a personal vendetta against her. It is a request of all guests for religious reasons. If she can't respect that, regardless of her beliefs, then that's on her. The wedding is not about her.", "NTA. Religious venues often have dress codes. Even Kate Middleton's wedding venue (Westminster Abbey) had a dress code and she and her guests had to obey it.\n\nEllie is just using this event to make some anti-religion BS stand.", "No because it's your wedding. In the west sometimes brides dress the bridesmaids up in a uniformed color or even rather homely to flatter themselves more.I've seen some oogly dresses they pick out for them.  If the bride says wear this they wear that. Sometimes they even tell the men, but men may or may not listen. Wear a tuxedo FINE, not tucking the shirt in though lol. Younger men mostly, but it happens. \n\n You just have all of your differences and feelings on social happenings concerning that bubbling up as argument which is what all the heat is about and the basic fact that it's your wedding to host and she is a guest is being glossed over. \n\n Ask her to please stick with that consideration, it's your wedding, you want it to be a certain way and you'd like her to be a part of it. Tell her during her wedding you'd do the same. Beach wedding bikini attire, cool. It's not ideological warfare here, it's personal tastes on an important personal day. Your pursuit of happiness here is not the pursuit of her misery. You'd like her to be a part of it and if it's too big an ask for a friend to not even bend over backwards but bend a little then you think that's hurtful because you'd bend for her on her day.\n\nI'd focus on that element of it hoping there can be common ground there because the rest of it is a wasps nest.", "NTA.

That's not a stupid reason.   She wants to ignore the restriction because she believes her atheism trumps the venue's restriction.  \n \nThat's not you having an agenda because of her atheism, that's her having an agenda because of the venue's restrictions.\n\nUninvite her from the ceremony and she's welcome at the reception.", "Info: when you say dress modestly, does that include covering the head? \n\nI can see why she would be uncomfortable with that.

I would probably go with NTA, because this is your wedding, not hers, she can dress how she wants at hers, but as long as it\u2019s yours she should comply to what you want as long as it\u2019s not completely unreasonable. Anyways, congratulations on getting married!", "NTA, when a guest in a religious building you have to follow the dress code, that\u2019s just being polite.

And that the ones who weren't ALSO TIED SCARVES ? Like it straight up shorted her brain. Finally calmed down then she learned you have to take your shoes off too....whoops", "It wasn't outlandish at all or even extreme", "I've been to Muslim weddings, it's just modest dress is all.  Nothing weird.", "How did you take that in a snippy manner? She literally just answered your question?", "Sorry. I see people get blasted for long answers here so I wanted to give a succinct reply. My apologies", "OP wasn't snippy? You might ve reading the tone totally wrong. She was responding totally normal.", ">Would she wear a short skirt for her friend if required? If she refuses because of religious beliefs, why isnt her friend allowed to refuse due to atheist mindset\n\nBecause the atheist mindset doesn't say a damned thing about clothing. The atheist mindset is \"do your own thing.\"", "If her friend says \"everyone has to wear a short skirt to my wedding\" and OP said, \"I can't do that because of my religion, I apologize but if that's the rule I can't come\" and that was the end of it, no one would be the asshole. Likewise in this scenario, if her friend had said \"I'm not comfortable with that, I can't come,\" no one would be the asshole. Her friend became the asshole when she threw a tantrum and said she'd break the dress code and come anyway, and when she started trying to make OP out as an asshole to all their other friends. It's not about the beliefs about clothing, it's about being a mature adult when it comes to someone else's special occasion.", "When did atheists start exclusively dressing immodestly? Cooperation with the dresscode out of respect of her friend's beliefs does not contradict atheism. If my vegan friend invites me to dinner I'll eat vegan. I'm going to eat meat at home later, but it's their party.", "A long skirt does not compromise any of my beliefs.  It does not force me to behave in a way I find intolerable.  \nPersonally, I don\u2019t eat meat. If I have a luncheon and only serve salad, bread, and cheese, my meat eating friends would enjoy it.  If they did the same but only served a steak, I would say I don\u2019t want to join them.  \nThere is a difference and keeping score doesn\u2019t make things equal.  That sounds like a terrible way to view the world.", "There is no such thing as a code of atheism. Individual atheists arrive at their beliefs on their own individual paths. Being an atheist is as irrelevant to the behavior of selfish people as being a bike rider or spending Wednesdays fishing---that is, not at all. But ignorant jerks who are just plain bad-mannered claim that it's their atheist religion because they know most folks won't challenge a \"religious\" excuse.", "Seems like their opinion can be discarded as simply rage/troll bait.", "You can't claim to be anti-theist and hate religion and then cry foul when someone calls you an islamophobe. Wear your truth.", "Okay then you hate all religions. That's fine. But why is it an issue what others believe? I've seen a lot of weddings where brides set dress codes. How is this any different than that? And yes, you have to respect others beliefs, you don't have to agree with them.", "Ohhh I didn\u2019t see that yet. Idk as I said in the post both men and women have been told to dress modestly so I don\u2019t think this is misogynistic?", "When a dress code is based on religion, then it is different than the dress code at the wedding per what you linked in.", "However, thousands of people actually up voted the comments that said that the OP was NTA.  Bride & Groom made the request for conservative attire.  It was the OPs bosses daughter, i.e., professional social obligation.  GF agreed with OP, OP bought GF appropriate dresses.  GF shows up with inappropriate attire for wedding claiming misogyny. \n\nWTF is with people who cannot understand that there are social rules for some events.  Those that host share rules, guests respect the rules or R.S.V.P. \"No\". It's not that difficult.\n\nEnjoy your wedding.  Might be time to cut ties with your friend who is causing you grief.", "Good luck for the marriage, anyhow!", "I wish I lived in a different universe. But when I first commented one of the few posts showing was a \u201cYTA\u201d, so sorry about that.", "My jaw is dropping in disbelief reading your story but at the same time I can picture it clear as day. What a nut - and your family sounds so lovely and welcoming of his.", "100% agree and that's why it's important that someone asked for more details.", "I have no idea what masjid is, and when asked to clarify, she snarkily said it was stated in the post. \nStill doesn't help everyone know what the dresscode is like.", "You didn't come off as snippy, theybsound like they're looking to be rude for no reason.", "You weren't snippy. They just have a case of the Ellies.", "I dont see why that should be less protected than religious stuff", "I could not have said it any better. OP is 1000% NTA here", "Again, its against religion itself, not especially islam, if you dont get that you shouldnt contribute in this discussion", "The difference is that one choses the dresscode due to taste and the other does it due to restrictions from a cult", "It's not misogynistic.  Don't listen to those people.", "Yeah that's what I said, but reddit has pointed out that men's dress is never an issue and the default is modest, while women are heavily sexualized and judged for their bodies so it's not the same", "Yeah, I'm that guy from the top post.  I was providing context and got heavily downvoted for this :/\n\nI don't think it's wrong of either bride.", "If only you were on some sort of device that could TELL you what a masjid is. If only.", "babes u can google it, she doesn't owe you translation... #embarrassing #dobetter", "You're typing on a computer. Google it instead of acting like you forgot computers exist. Lord", "OP said she and her husband are muslims and two words that are arabic(? sorry if wrong) so I'd assume it's like a christian wedding at a church. And even further in the post OP stated that it's a place of worship, and a lot of muslim women cover themselves up so you could connect the dots even without googling. Or you could just have directly asked what it is. \"Hey, I don't know this word, can you explain it to me?\"", "Exactly. I had to go read the FAQ for a local masjid to get a straight answer.", "There's nothing to protect. There is no atheist cultural dress. Atheism is about a lack of the divine, so there are no rules. I say that as an atheist", "This mindset is possibly islamophobic.", "Because individual atheists have their individual beliefs: there is no atheist code. Just saying that you refuse to dress appropriately to enter another person's place of worship is not a religious tenet anywhere.", "Islam is a subset of all religions bud.

There are a few atheist clubs, but there's no central doctrine outside of \"no god.\"\n\nYou're making bad faith arguments.", "Ah yes, please tell me what are the sacred practices of atheism?", "What we are trying to explain to you is that this is not atheism. Atheism can be about many things, but it's not about individual clothing choices.", "Ellie spotted", "Besides the fact that you made up that word, yes. Having faith in something unprovable is inherently the opposite of rational. That doesn't mean they can't be rational about other topics, just like I don't assume you hate puppies just because you hate religion.", "If you truly needed to know, you'd work it out on your own.", "Its not about the clothing choice its about the fact that the clothing restrictions are based on religion"]}
