She happily agreed, so I dropped the dog off at her place and told her I would pick her back up the next day after work. \nHowever, when I came to pick Lilo up I was shocked to see that she hadn\u2019t been taken care of at all. The cans of food I brought for her were still unopened and she hadn\u2019t been taken outside, not even to go potty. Instead, she had peed on the floor after not being able to hold it any longer, and my sister just halfheartedly tossed a towel over the puddle of urine. \nI didn\u2019t get mad at my sister though, because I know this was all due to her mental illness. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are going on a trip over the weekend next week, and we\u2019re planning to leave Lilo with a friend of mine who is also a dog owner.

I worry about your mom calling you insensitive, does she mean that your sister's wish to have the dog should weigh more than doggies safety and wellbeing? It's good that you didn't get mad at your sister. But did you talk to her about what taking care of a dog means, specifically? Like going outside, playtime, feeding, hygiene, following/enforcing the rules that doggie learns, etc? Sister can be mad, but you didn't do anything wrong. Taking care of a dog is a big responsibility, doggie also needs stability and sometimes someone is just not capable of offering that.", "NTA an animal like a dog needs interaction.

If she's not in therapy, having an animal would be helpful, but my concern would be getting an animal that would require more than she can give at times.\n\nEdit: The support animal should only be seriously looked into if she is actually showing responsibility.

But I just can\u2019t trust her again and her episodes are impossible to predict", "Perfect answer right here.", ">it can cause physical distress for a dog who has been potty trained, as they can begin to feel they are \u201cbad dogs\u201d because they know better, and that anxiety effects them physically as well as psychologically. \n\nThat part is so important. I feel so bad thinking about poor dogs that are forced to go inside, knowing they're not supposed to, and having to be \"bad\" without wanting to be. People who do this to dogs really upset me.", "Agreed. I don't buy it that it's just depression. I think it's another issue entirely that makes a person be that cruel to an animal.", "All of this is completely spot on. I\u2019d even add further that, as much as sister may want to take care of the dog in theory, it clearly is too great a stressor in reality.", "I am a (albeit retired) mental health professional, and this is partially true. When I had a patient who was as seriously depressed as this sister sounds to be, the first thing we would do was work on improving their mental health. Only when we reached a point where I felt confident that the patient would get up to walk a dog, to care for a cat properly, or to complete the tasks required in caring for the companion of their choosing would I then recommend considering a companion animal. People make jokes about people getting a plant or a \u201cstarter fish\u201d, but that might be something that\u2019s recommended - because if you aren\u2019t going to complete the comparatively minor care of watering and rotating a plant or of feeding a fish and keeping its aquarium clean and at an adequate temperature, I can\u2019t feel confident that you will do those things for an animal with more complex needs. \n\nThe idea is to get the animal and bond them closely when the person is on an upswing; then, if the patient deteriorates later, they still feel obligated to walk that dog, even if they are too depressed to get up.  Most - assuming we\u2019re talking about depression and not more complex issues - will still toilet and walk their dog even if they aren\u2019t showering themselves.  That\u2019s where the benefit comes in and helps them keep going and keep asking for help because they will ask for help if not for themselves then so the pet doesn\u2019t suffer.", "A very good point! Dog is a living soul, not just a source of comfort or emotional support. If Lilo is not a trained support dog, then they should not be used as a medicine/treatment against depression.

At this point the sister should NOT be in charge of a pet. \nShe can't care for herself or another, she couldn't even care for someone else's puppy during an overnight stay, if she were to get an emotional support animal at this time it would get neglected. \n\nI have severe chronic depression. I know how hard it is. But I also have 2 cats that no matter what I will roll out of bed for to care for them. Or when I can't I know to ask for help in their care. \n\nSister needs some serious treatment and therapy before an emotional support animal is suggested", "That\u2019s a good idea, Thanks! I\u2019ll suggest that to her!", "Good call to not just trust her on her word again. Maybe you could invite your sister to be involved in actually caring for Lilo, for example go on long walks together, and afterwards brush doggie or something. Not only the fun and easy stuff, but also picking up the poo, leash training/commands like stop at sidewalk before crossing, not pulling on leash etc. Together with you. Even if you are the one holding the leash, she can still observe and learn. That way she can enjoy Lilo's company and participate in taking care of doggie, and maybe gradually prove (over time) that she understands what it takes. And you are able to observe and judge if she is capable of that.", "NTA your dog would be ok with no food or even water for one day, although thirsty, but a week?  NFW", "Maybe you could let her watch him while you go to the gym or run some errands, for a few hours, to see if she might be more responsible now, and maybe lift her spirits a little. But an entire weekend? Nope! Stand your ground.", "Yes, I agree with your add-on. I just read a reply from OP  on someone else's comment, and I replied to that, with a suggestion that might be helpful to clear up any misunderstandings OP's sister might have, about what caring for a dog on a daily basis really means, while also opening the door for sister to prove that she is willing and capable to take on that responsibility (in the future)", "Good comments. I was cat sitting some years ago, apparently still not well enough as I felt exhausted because cat had to be fed more than once. (My husband was there as well, so no risk of cat being neglected.) \n\nNow we have a cat and I\u2019d be able to care for her on my own, including her required cuddles of at least 3x20 minutes a day.

I didn't mean to help her get an animal now. In time, down the road, it's something to think about.

My top priority in living situation is a fenced yard for him. \n\nMy cats litter boxes might not get cleaned as often as they should - but I have a pretty hard rule that I can\u2019t shower unless I\u2019ve just cleaned the litter box. So while I may slack on both, combining the two gets my ass in gear to ensure its liveable. \n\nThey ALWAYS have food and water. Always. I raised my pets as grazers, so there is always dry food available to them.

I might not eat meals regularly or properly take care of myself when my depression is at its worst. \n\nBut my pets are ALWAYS taken care of. Because I am responsible for them and they depend on me to live. \n\nEven at my worst my priority goes:\n\n1) Go to work. I need money to take care of my pets. \n2) Take care of my pets. \n3) Indulge in something that makes me feel better or at least distracts me. \n4) Communicate with loved ones. \n5) Try to take care of myself. \n6) Try to take care of my house. \n\nTheir lives literally depend on me. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t leave them in her care for more than a few hours. With a young dog, I wouldn\u2019t leave it in her care for longer than a bathroom break for it. \n\nShe broke your trust and neglected your dog. It was depending on her to meet its basic needs, and she failed. Her depression is just an excuse - you can FEEL lethargic and have no energy but you CANT neglect basic life essentials for someone in your care.  She showed you she does not have the willpower to do that, so she can\u2019t be trusted to take care of your dog again.", "I have clinical depression and I wouldn't leave a dog with me either.

It's not your responsibility to protect her feelings when it comes to the care of your dog", "NTA.\n\nYou tested that theory already, and she let your dog starve. The dog is your baby, and you're responsible for making sure she's OK. It sounds like your mother is enabling your sister; she needs to stop.", "NTA and depression is not an excuse for neglecting that poor dog.  I have depression and even on my worst days and I can't even bring myself to shower or eat I still take care of my fur babies.  She has already neglected your dog once.  She'll do it again.", "Depressed person here.  I still manage to regularly feed the people and creatures in my care.  Depression makes it harder but it can still be done.", "This is why I absolutely hate when people suggest that a severely depressed person should get a pet to help them feel better.  If you can't take care of yourself because of your depression, you sure as hell can't take care of another living creature on top of that.  It's like they only see the fun parts of owning a pet - playing with it, taking pics of it, etc. - but they don't see the much larger part that requires you to actually care for the animal.  Shit, I have guinea pigs and you would be stunned to know how much work they are.\n\nPets aren't toys, and you should never get a pet when your mental/physical condition is so bad that you can't even take care of yourself.\n\nOh, and NTA.", "To me, the issue here isn\u2019t whether she was able; it\u2019s that when she *wasn\u2019t* able, she didn\u2019t (or couldn\u2019t) communicate. If she had, I\u2019d think maybe ask friend to be the backup plan if she has another depressive episode, but as is, you can\u2019t trust her to communicate if she\u2019s unable to meet even the most basic needs of the life you would be leaving in her hands.\n\nFirm NTA. Being sensitive to her situation means accepting it for what it is, not pretending it\u2019s something else.", "You are NTA wanting to make sure your dog is safe and cared for. I struggle with severe depression but my 2 cats are always fed and their litter box is cleaned out in a timely manner, even on days I can\u2019t manage to take a shower. I\u2019m sorry your sister is struggling but I don\u2019t think her reaction or demand that she be the one to take care of your dog despite your valid concerns is fair. Hopefully she can get to a place where respecting your boundaries/ concerns is possible. Until then it\u2019s ok for you to not let her depression give her a blank check for whatever", "Considering she saw herself as fit enough last time and clearly doesn't regret what she did towards your dog then, you have no reason to believe that she has improved to the point of actually doing a proper dog sitting job, and you certainly aren't required to test that theory by potentionally putting your dog through that again. Or, even worse, she knew she wasn't mentally ready last time, but didn't care and just greedy wanted your dog there for her at its expence.", "Well she needs to build up trust through actions not words and certainly not from pressuring you into giving in", "Why is she making it about her? This isn't about her. It's about the dog. And her insistence on making it all about her is just further evidence she isn't up to the task.", "Bananas that she thinks the fact that she's doing better in this moment means you can trust her to continue to be so while your dog's wellbeing is her responsibility. Which is what this issue actually is: trustworthiness. NTA. Hope your sister finds a system that helps her stay out of these dark places more often than not. But super hard n t a.", "Yup it\u2019s not her fault but she should still respect other people\u2019s decisions and also try to better realistically evaluate her current capabilities.\n\n Also, it didn\u2019t seem like she addressed or took accountability for the incident with Lilo last time. Even if it was a result of her depression she still needs to take some form of accountability for her actions, which it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s done here.\n\nI\u2019m saying this as someone with chronic, severe depression", "No it's not. It's a terrible idea. Do not do this.", "I also have severe depression, and my dog and cats are sometimes the ONLY thing I can manage to take care of. They\u2019ve helped me in so many ways. I would never dream of neglecting my animals. A lot of mental health professionals will even recommend getting a pet for people with depression, because it gives them something to take care of. \n\nBut I am also self aware enough to know that taking care of these animals is a responsibility and one that I can\u2019t ignore, no matter the circumstances. \n\nYour sister\u2019s depression is not an excuse for neglecting your dog. NTA, OP.", "Exactly. And if it **were** so bad that she couldn\u2019t take care of the pupper, she should have called OP the moment she realized it. \n\nThen the fact that she wasn\u2019t utterly mortified when OP came to get the pup also shows that it wasn\u2019t deep guilt/shame keeping her from calling OP. \n\nThis cannot be attributed to mental health alone, and it\u2019s detrimental to do so!", "Ditto. I'm currently in a depressive episode and caring for my cats always takes priority. They are entirely dependent on me, I chose to have them, it's not fair to make them suffer. *Especially* when they make me feel better. \n\nOP, NTA. It may be something your sister can do in the future, but now isn't the best time. Try again later with another weekend sleepover and go from there.", "Yes this! I have depression and I'm a foster parent. I foster dogs and cats, I also have 4 cats and a dog of my own. If there was ever a point I don't think I could care for them I ask for help. I always manage to care for them. NTA", "And she shouldn't be trying to take the dog again without proving herself", "I would have recommended that too if the sister hadn\u2019t tried to pressure her. OP shouldn\u2019t award bad behaviour and the lack of respect towards her OP\u2019s decisions", "Yup! And when it DOES get to that point you need to take drastic actions to protect your pet - whether it\u2019s rehoming or making a change in your own life in some form", "I always managed to get up and care for my Gerbils. How could I not change their water when they were relying fully on me? Starting with their water usually motivated me to keep going and do everything else. Pets are awesome motivaters, but it's not their responsibility to make you do things either.\n\nThe Sister didn't even feed the poor dog, that's the absolute minimum level of care.", "When my depression was at its worst I couldn't, but (un?)luckily he was a very old boy not super interested in going for walks. I did still manage to feed him twice a day and take him into the garden for a play and the loo. I can't imagine not feeding him at all and just letting him mess inside the house.", "Sometimes having someone who relies on you for their basic everyday needs can keep you from falling over the edge.", "100% especially the Lego part", "> The sister has no excuse whatsoever\n\nWell i mean she may have a similar condition, but it could manifest in different ways. She very well could have been unable to do things that you are able - through sheer force of will - to accomplish.", "But this is adopting the same troubling mentality of people who are simply free of mental illness and insist everyone else just suck it up. \"IM able to suck it up and do these things\".  Maybe she ISN'T. We can never fully understand what she goes through.\n\nSo while yes, it makes sense to deny her such a responsibility, for the very same reason, she aughtn't be subjected to the judgement of exhibiting some sort of moral failing."]}
