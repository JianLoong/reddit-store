A few months ago, my boyfriend and I adopted an adorable little puppy named Lilo, who she absolutely loves and who always manages to lighten her mood. Because of this, I offered to bring Lilo over to her apartment for a sleepover about a month ago when my sister was having a rough week. She happily agreed, so I dropped the dog off at her place and told her I would pick her back up the next day after work. \nHowever, when I came to pick Lilo up I was shocked to see that she hadn\u2019t been taken care of at all. The cans of food I brought for her were still unopened and she hadn\u2019t been taken outside, not even to go potty. Instead, she had peed on the floor after not being able to hold it any longer, and my sister just halfheartedly tossed a towel over the puddle of urine. \nI didn\u2019t get mad at my sister though, because I know this was all due to her mental illness. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are going on a trip over the weekend next week, and we\u2019re planning to leave Lilo with a friend of mine who is also a dog owner. When my sister heard about this she said that she wanted to take care of her instead, but I refused and said that I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea because of what happened last time. Now my sister is mad at me and my mom told me I was being insensitive and should have agreed to let her take care of my dog.

NTA at all. You gave her a chance previously, and she failed. How can you even think you're the AH at all?\n\nIt would be neglectful and borderline abusive to knowingly leave your dog with somebody that you know won't take care of it.", "NTA good for you for being responsible with your precious pup. Your sister may be depressed and may even enjoy having Lilo around, but she\u2019s proven herself not to be 100% trustworthy and responsible with your puppy, especially long term.", "NTA - she is not responsible enough. The puppy should not suffer because of this.", "NtA. Your dog has to suffer just so you can be polite to your sister? Not worth it.", "You are NTA, not at all. An animal is not a toy; they are living beings who requires love, attention, and care of their physical needs.  That includes walking, toileting, attention, feeding, water - you didn\u2019t even mention water, but I feel like if she wasn\u2019t feeding Lilo, water wasn\u2019t being regularly cleaned and refilled - and maybe even things like medication or wound care. Throwing a towel over the puddle is not appropriate, can u see mine established potty training, and presents an environmental toxin; it can cause physical distress for a dog who has been potty trained, as they can begin to feel they are \u201cbad dogs\u201d because they know better, and that anxiety effects them physically as well as psychologically. \n\nYou made a promise and accepted an obligation when you adopted LILO, that you would love her and take care of her. Leaving her unsupervised with your sister before she accepts the help she needs *and* recovers would be a breech of that promise. \n\nNTA", "NTA, I appreciate you trying to help your sister with an overnight with the puppy, but it clearly did not work.  So in order to keep your sisters home sanitary and your puppy happy and healthy, she is staying at another house for the weekend.  \n\nIf you were willing to compromise, for another time, maybe have the puppy stay with your parents and your sister can babysit with another responsible adult in the house?  Test the waters again so to speak.  However, you are under no obligation to do that.  Animals do help with mental illness (i had two little guinea pigs that honestly saved my life) but only if you have the support and the ability to care for them the way then need to be treated. If your depression is that bad, you need a back up plan to help you with your animals.", "NTA... and your mom is an AH for sticking her nose in...\n\nAbsolutely have to protect your dog...", "NTA. Your dog\u2019s well being matters and you\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA the well-being of your dog is of the upmost importance and you are being a responsible pet owner by keeping your dog out of her \u201ccare\u201d.", "Title is hella misleading. NTA because it has nothing to do with her battling depression and everything to do with her being neglectful", "NTA\n\nYour sister has already proved she cannot take care of your dog for even one night. You'd be mad to let her try for an entire weekend.", "Solid NTA. You seem like a good sister, and responsible  pet owner. I worry about your mom calling you insensitive, does she mean that your sister's wish to have the dog should weigh more than doggies safety and wellbeing? It's good that you didn't get mad at your sister. But did you talk to her about what taking care of a dog means, specifically? Like going outside, playtime, feeding, hygiene, following/enforcing the rules that doggie learns, etc? Sister can be mad, but you didn't do anything wrong. Taking care of a dog is a big responsibility, doggie also needs stability and sometimes someone is just not capable of offering that.", "NTA an animal like a dog needs interaction. She did not feed it or take it out for the night she had it. With you gone a week from the dog it needs someone who will take responsibility and will feed water and even walk and play with them. The dog being a puppy means they will likely have energy they need to get out and they need someone who will care for it properly.", "NTA. Your dog deserves quality care and your sister cannot provide it. I get that she's struggling but your dog will be struggling too, if left in her care.", "Nta !!! Oh no!!", "NTA. Nothing spoke of a change or breakthrough that would make it seem like she was in a better place and the pup would be cared for properly.", "Obviously NTA.  I'm not a mental health professional, but I  thought pets were good for people with depression because you have to take care of them--feed them, play with them, cuddle them, take them for walks. If your sister can't take care of a puppy for a day or two, her mental illness might be more serious than you think.  Don't put Lilo in a position where she is being neglected.  Your sister needs help, but given how your Mom responded, I think it's a real problem.  If she has a psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist, you should advise that person of what happened, so at least they are aware how potentially serious the situation might be.", "NTA at all. Your sister seems to be incapable of properly caring for Lilo.", "NTA for the sake of your dog! Your sister is struggling to take care of herself and isn't in a place to be taking care of others. That's not an insult or insensitive, it's the truth of her situation. Maybe when she's feeling like herself now and isn't in a low, then she could do day sitting or something, but she's not fit at the moment to do what she'd like.", "NTA.  Maybe your sister is in a better psychological place now and everything would be fine, but she doesn't get to put your pet at risk to prove it.", "NTA because she proved that she wouldn\u2019t do the very minimum for the dog when you trusted her before. She can try to earn your trust by having Lilo for an hour or two from time to time, but leaving the dog with her for multiple days after she wasn\u2019t even feeding her or taking her out to go potty is a no go. Tell her that trust is earned after it has been broken like that previously. She didn\u2019t tell you last time that she couldn\u2019t handle it and she didn\u2019t call you to pick the puppy up or call anybody else for help when she couldn\u2019t figure out how to do the most basic things for her. She\u2019s going to have to take the initiative to show that she\u2019s in a better place now before it\u2019s reasonable to expect you to trust her to doggie sit again.", "NTA. Your sister needs professional help. Lilo cannot provide that kind of support.", "NTA\n\nA dog is a living, feeling being and as such should not be subject to experiments when it comes to its physical or psychological well-being. \n\nYou would also not be able to enjoy your trip if you have to worry about your dog.", "Definitely NTA. She's shown you that she can't take care of your dog before, and she needs to build up your trust again if she wants to take care of Lilo again. It's horrible that she's struggling, but at the same time, you need to take care of your dog.", "NTA. You have to looked after the welfare of your dog, and it clearly isn't in Lilo's interests to spend the weekend at your sister's house since just one day didn't go well. \n\nAs far as your mum saying you are insensitive, does she know what you found when your sister last 'took care' of Lilo?", "NTA, if her depressive episodes are so bad that she actively ignores and borderline abuses an animal, then under no circumstances should they be left in charge of one.", "NTA, but you could have said you felt it would be better for the dog to spend some time with another dog for socialization and play. \n\nAnimals play such a helpful role in our lives. If your sister is in therapy at present, you could tell her to talk to her therapist about an emotional support animal. If she's not in therapy, having an animal would be helpful, but my concern would be getting an animal that would require more than she can give at times.\n\nEdit: The support animal should only be seriously looked into if she is actually showing responsibility. Someone else noted in their comment that it would be better to allow your dog to spend an afternoon or maybe a night at your sister's. That might help to be able to see if she starts showing responsibility or if she continues to neglect giving proper care.", "NTA,\n\nYou could always try again later, in a more controlled manner. For an afternoon first, maybe a night later on when you think she can handle it.", "NTA all the way.", "NTA", "NTA. She has shown she can not be responsible for her, and the reason for her not taking care of Lilo is irrelevant. She can not provide adequate care for your dog so you can not leave her with your sister. So you mom and sister both feel it\u2019s ok to neglect an animal???", "NTA. She needs to accept that by doing an awful nonjob of it last time she lost your trusr to do it again. Dogs are living creatures and deserve to be taken care of by someone who won't neglect them.", "NTA. Better let your sister be angry than your dog mistreated. Tell your mom this has nothing to do with her", "NTA\n\nIt's also important to remember that mental illness can affect a person's ability to care for themselves and others, and it may be necessary to make accommodations or find alternative arrangements in certain situations. It's important to be understanding and supportive of your sister and her struggles with mental health, while also considering the needs of all parties involved.", "She's not taking care of the animal which is the whole point of finding someone to care for it when you're not there. NTA", "NTA.  No matter the reason, you choose a sitter for your own pet.  I just had a great pet sitting job b/c the former sitter, while good with the pet, left the place a mess.  Again, doesn't matter the reason- the pet owner decides.", "NTA don\u2019t you do that please let the dog owner take care of her because that\u2019s like giving a baby to somebody battling depression if she could ignore the puppy like that the same would go for a child so let\u2019s not send the puppy back", "**NTA**\n\n**Save the dog! Be a good mama bear. Ignore whatever stupid, senseless gaslighting by mother**\n\nIf this was a child and sister left her in the same diaper for days, crying on the floor not cleaned or fed what's that called? Oh yeah, ***ABUSE & NEGLECT!***\n\nA baby, cat or dog aren't disposable forks can buy a replacement. They are live beings that can be permanently physically, mentally, emotionally damaged from abuse or worse killed. *Don't ever let her do any more harm than she has.* ***She was given a change & blew it, never will she get another.***", "NTA, obviously she isn\u2019t able to take care of the dog, so you\u2019d be an asshole to the dog to leave it with her.", "NTA\u2026nope. Your sister has prove she cannot even care for your pup for one night, why would she think you would let her watch your pup for longer?   Buy her a plant.  Tell her when you see that she can tKe care of said plant, then you might let her watch your pup again.", "NTA- if she wants to be responsible for the dog in the future, she needs to prove it with shorter instances of caring for her over a few hours at a time, probably supervised at first to ensure minimal stress for the dog.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I just can\u2019t trust her again and her episodes are impossible to predict", "Perfect answer right here.", ">it can cause physical distress for a dog who has been potty trained, as they can begin to feel they are \u201cbad dogs\u201d because they know better, and that anxiety effects them physically as well as psychologically. \n\nThat part is so important. I feel so bad thinking about poor dogs that are forced to go inside, knowing they're not supposed to, and having to be \"bad\" without wanting to be. People who do this to dogs really upset me.", "Agreed. I don't buy it that it's just depression. I think it's another issue entirely that makes a person be that cruel to an animal.", "All of this is completely spot on. I\u2019d even add further that, as much as sister may want to take care of the dog in theory, it clearly is too great a stressor in reality.", "I am a (albeit retired) mental health professional, and this is partially true. When I had a patient who was as seriously depressed as this sister sounds to be, the first thing we would do was work on improving their mental health. Only when we reached a point where I felt confident that the patient would get up to walk a dog, to care for a cat properly, or to complete the tasks required in caring for the companion of their choosing would I then recommend considering a companion animal. People make jokes about people getting a plant or a \u201cstarter fish\u201d, but that might be something that\u2019s recommended - because if you aren\u2019t going to complete the comparatively minor care of watering and rotating a plant or of feeding a fish and keeping its aquarium clean and at an adequate temperature, I can\u2019t feel confident that you will do those things for an animal with more complex needs. \n\nThe idea is to get the animal and bond them closely when the person is on an upswing; then, if the patient deteriorates later, they still feel obligated to walk that dog, even if they are too depressed to get up.  Most - assuming we\u2019re talking about depression and not more complex issues - will still toilet and walk their dog even if they aren\u2019t showering themselves.  That\u2019s where the benefit comes in and helps them keep going and keep asking for help because they will ask for help if not for themselves then so the pet doesn\u2019t suffer.", "A very good point! Dog is a living soul, not just a source of comfort or emotional support. If Lilo is not a trained support dog, then they should not be used as a medicine/treatment against depression. Unless maybe in the form of cute pictures/videos that make you feel warm and fuzzy inside  \ud83d\udcf8 \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc15", "No sorry but that's putting the animal at risk. At this point the sister should NOT be in charge of a pet. \nShe can't care for herself or another, she couldn't even care for someone else's puppy during an overnight stay, if she were to get an emotional support animal at this time it would get neglected. \n\nI have severe chronic depression. I know how hard it is. But I also have 2 cats that no matter what I will roll out of bed for to care for them. Or when I can't I know to ask for help in their care. \n\nSister needs some serious treatment and therapy before an emotional support animal is suggested", "That\u2019s a good idea, Thanks! I\u2019ll suggest that to her!", "Good call to not just trust her on her word again. Maybe you could invite your sister to be involved in actually caring for Lilo, for example go on long walks together, and afterwards brush doggie or something. Not only the fun and easy stuff, but also picking up the poo, leash training/commands like stop at sidewalk before crossing, not pulling on leash etc. Together with you. Even if you are the one holding the leash, she can still observe and learn. That way she can enjoy Lilo's company and participate in taking care of doggie, and maybe gradually prove (over time) that she understands what it takes. And you are able to observe and judge if she is capable of that.", "NTA your dog would be ok with no food or even water for one day, although thirsty, but a week?  NFW", "Maybe you could let her watch him while you go to the gym or run some errands, for a few hours, to see if she might be more responsible now, and maybe lift her spirits a little. But an entire weekend? Nope! Stand your ground.", "Yes, I agree with your add-on. I just read a reply from OP  on someone else's comment, and I replied to that, with a suggestion that might be helpful to clear up any misunderstandings OP's sister might have, about what caring for a dog on a daily basis really means, while also opening the door for sister to prove that she is willing and capable to take on that responsibility (in the future)", "Good comments. I was cat sitting some years ago, apparently still not well enough as I felt exhausted because cat had to be fed more than once. (My husband was there as well, so no risk of cat being neglected.) \n\nNow we have a cat and I\u2019d be able to care for her on my own, including her required cuddles of at least 3x20 minutes a day. And now she truly improves my mental health.\n\nSo thank you for adding your thoughts, caring for both human and animal well being \ud83d\ude3b", "I'd remove my comment if I wasn't worried the system might remove yours, because I really think this needs the assessment of professionals like yourself, and I hope OP sees your opinion.", "You're absolutely right that it's neglect and not the depression with OPs sister. I didn't mean to help her get an animal now. In time, down the road, it's something to think about. I have kids, and 1 does their pet chores while the other doesn't, and that prevents me from allowing them to get another pet as they are not going to take proper care of the animal.", "I saw what dogs can do for people who suffer from depression. But there's no use \"borrowing\" or geting. On one herself if she can't handle it at the moment.", "It\u2019s a common misunderstanding.  No harm, no foul.  :)"]}
