So your son, a good college student, just dropped out because his calling was to work at The coffee bean? What happened there?\nYTA. OP, you seem like an inflexible parent and you see your kid an an investment gone wrong. Your son is a person, and even if you see him as a business (people can be obtuse) you\u2019ll understand that even the best ones go through ups and downs. This is supposed to be your best one and you\u2019re throwing it out. I hope you don\u2019t mind if your own child doesn\u2019t want to see you anymore. Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re creating.", "Info what's the problem? Just be honest with your former son that you don't want to ever see or speak to him again. He will be so much better off without you in his life", "Wow, some parent you are. Your son is 19 yrs old and you have decided you are out. I get it, just be honest and tell him that you don't give a flying F for him and don't want to be reminded of what a dissapointement to you he is, so you plan to trash his clothes and stuff for the remaining child that you do care about. \n\nYes, if you have to ask. YTA and a pitiful excuse for a parent. It's not a problem to want an adult to remove stuff you don't want to store, but every other part of your comment shows just how much of an AH you are.", "YTA\n\n1. There's no interpersonal conflict here.  It's just you being disappointed in your son for not doing what you think he should with \\*his\\* life.\n2. Your \"sacrifices\" were your choice, not his.  He doesn't owe you anything.\n3. You don't have to store his stuff. He's an adult and should take care of himself. But your judgement and sense of entitlement over his life puts you firmly in the AH column.", "YTA - sounds like you were only \u201cclose\u201d when your kid was compliant. I have zero patience for parents whose love is so blatantly conditional.", "I'm going with YTA because all your questions to him seem to deal with \"what are you doing\", not \"how are you doing\".\n\nThere's more going on here that is being shared, either because you don't want to share it or because you are still ignorant to it. Is there any indication your son is struggling mentally, has he seen a therapist since dropping out? Was engineering what he wanted to do in the first place or what you wanted? \n\nI had a friend when I was young who wanted to be a teacher since we were in elementary school, then she dropped out halfway through getting her bachelor's and nobody I asked knew why. I wondered about it for a long time because it's all she ever wanted and she never posted on social media about why she left or took time off. Found out years later she was sexually assaulted during her sophomore year and went home to be closer to family and undergo therapy, but never felt safe enough to return to campus so completed an online program of some sort. \n\nYou can't know what's going on with someone if you don't ask, even if they're your own child. So ask.", "You and your ex need to grow up and parent him together. You should help him some, but have him get an apartment and start paying for his life. He will probably be ok, but will reconsider school. College during the pandemic sucked and maybe the time off and working will help.", "YTA, it sounds like your son has made a bad life choice and you're angry with him. But I don't think you'll get your message across to him like this.", "Got to the Coffee Bean part and I'm out.  Except to say YTA.", "YTA\n\nI wish I had had the courage and ability to take a year off between high school and college. I was a high-achieving high school student who went into a good private university. I survived, but I did far better when I took a few years off, worked at a fairly low stress job, and then went back for my master's degree in a completely different field.\n\nYou have plenty of evidence that your kid does not have problems with academics, and even can stand up to the rigor of university. But it looks like he's burned out.", "I'm going with YTA. I would guess that your son has spent most of his life trying to appease you instead of choosing a path he really wanted. Love is supposed to be unconditional, whereas yours is based solely on his net worth. Did you even bother to speak to him and ask if he was struggling or depressed? He got a job, obviously, but not the job YOU wanted.  Don't be surprised if he never speaks to you again.", "YTA. He didn\u2019t choose to have you as a parent, or to have you pay for expensive private schools and to move to an expensive area. He declined your demands and moved out when you kicked him out. Now you want to throw everything he has out at your house out bc he isn\u2019t going down the \u201cdream path\u201d that you have chosen. It\u2019s less about throwing his stuff out and more about you trying to control his life path. \n\nYou want him to live out your dreams, not his own. If working at a coffee shop right now (or for forever) makes him happy, you should support that.", "Are you taking lessons in how to sound like a hurtful ass, or does it come naturally?\n\nYes, it's perfectly reasonable for you to want to subsidize your kids whilst they're pursuing their education, with the understanding that the subsidy stops when they get a job.\n\nYour son has apparently chosen not to complete his degree, but to work in a coffee shop. That's his choice, and so he owns the consequence, which means paying for his accommodation (or in this case, moving in with mom who is apparently happy to put him up). \n\nThreatening to toss his stuff is a bit harsh - can you not offer to store his stuff in your attic / basement / something?\n\nYTA", "NTA he\u2019s a grown man and has made life choices that he, as a grown man, needs to learn how to live with. His mommy can keep her baby boy and his crap at her house.", "YTA - you sound like one of those parents who\u2019s disappointed to find out their children have minds of their own. Never understood it.", "YTA. Only thing pressure does is cause them to dig in the heels more. It's obvious that he knows he can't talk to you about what his goals are.", "YTA: Your son's choices with regard to career (or lack thereof) should not have any say in how you treat his belongings.  If you really care about his academic achievement, why would you throw away his books? All you're doing now is further estranging yourself from him and teaching him that your love/respect is conditional.", "YTA so he's only your son when he's educated. You chose to be a parent when you slept with his mum, you are a parent for life. You are teaching him that love is conditional on education and your younger son sees this too. They are their own people and won't want the same career that you want for them. He may go back to uni, but he won't if you keep at him. \n\nStop being an ass and try being a loving parent that is there for him no matter what.", "NTA for wanting his stuff out, but for everything else you are. You made the choices to send him to private school and live in a nice area. That's all you, while ideally he would appreciate that it doesn't mean he actually owes you anything for it. \n\nFrankly I think a year or two off to see what working is like isn't a bad idea anyway for many people that age.", "Dude YTA\n\nI wonder why yall don't talk much anymore, hmmm?", "YTA just for your attitude alone. He does need to get his belongings out of your house, but holy crap, dude. Way to destroy every remaining shred of relationship you might have ever had with him.

However the fight went down, if he has essentially moved out, he needs to also take his things. I don't know any parents who refuse to store any of their kids stuff, but you do you I guess.\n\nNo, the reason you suck here is because you are essentially cutting him off for being a teen without a plan, even though he DOES have a job. He IS working and learning valuable skills that he can take into other jobs. He's not sitting around 24/7 playing games and hanging with friends and expecting you to fund it. He is *employed*. Your entire beef, and your reason for cutting off your CHILD, is that his job isn't...good enough?\n\nI don't know what your magical bar for *good enough* is, but if you've been paying attention to the world at all, you'll know that even if he was in college and got that degree, he might STILL end up in a minimum wage job or three. A Bachelor's degree is *not* a guarantee of a successful career.\n\nIt would be reasonable to ask for rent, to ask for him to contribute to living expenses, and if he needs to change his job or get another one to meet his financial needs them he'll need to figure it out. But shaming ANYONE for doing a job, just because you don't think that job is good enough, is 100% asshole behavior, even if it wasn't your own kid.\n\nLiterally zero of your sacrifices obligate him to live his life your way.

It's fine you want his stuff out, but you can communicate it nicely with a decent deadline.\n\nIf your son needs more time to find his path, that's fine. Not everyone does the HS+college+job then married with 2 kids before 30. Not everyone become happy the same way.\n\nYour son will remember how you treated him, and it's a pity to ruin your relationship for that. My father did the same to me. I dropped medical school and wandered few years before finding what makes me happy (I'm an engineer now).

I am 100% behind giving someone like this a kick. The problem is, you did it in a situation where it doesn't really hurt. You told him to move out and he moved to his mother's house. Nothing really changed. The mother is an AH for being an enabler. And as someone who is still in debt due to college after 10 years, your son is an AH for not recognizing the work you put in to help them go to school.", "I am mixed on N T A or A H. \n\nChildren don\u2019t owe their parents anything for being born. So he does not owe you for your sacrifices. \n\nThat being said you have a right to say who lives in your house.

He doesn\u2019t live there anymore.\n\nOn a separate note, I think you should ease up on your 19 year old.  He\u2019s made his choice, you thought kicking him out would make him change his mind, he didn\u2019t.  I\u2019m not saying let him move back in, but I would work on repairing that relationship lest he goes NC.", "NTA. Your son is 19 and doesn't live with you and you're not a storage unit.\n\nOn the subject of his career trajectory, you might want to take a minute and rethink your position. There are a lot of miserable people out there who picked their career at 18/19 and hate it. I worked with an engineer when we were both straight out of school who figured out he hated engineering within a year. He found himself applying to general labor jobs because he just didn't want major responsibilities or anyone calling him after 5 pm. That's a hell of a thing to realize when you have 5 figures of student loans to pay off.", "NTA, once he decided to move put that includes all his stuff.

Yes, it is entirely possible.\n\nStop deciding that people not doing what you would do means they must be going through a mental breakdown. Maybe the son just wants to work.

He's not going to \"fall behind\" if he takes just one fucking second to breathe at 19. There's no prize for racing straight through school and into a career. At a certain point, it ceases to matter. When you're 45, nobody's counting whether you've been out of school for 22 or 24 years. But I will tell you, as someone who raced through school like I needed to get to the finish line first, committing to a whole career path in your teens and then unwinding all that shit and changing your mind later is a lot more complicated than figuring things out early in the process.\n\nYou seem like someone who gets very stressed out if stuff isn't happening RIGHT NOW. I'd suggest that maybe you take a little step back and take a breath yourself. Nothing bad is going to happen if your kid doesn't have a plan for a year or two. Nothing bad is going to happen if his stuff's still in your place on Feb 1. You can't force everything. Take a beat, and realize that the rest of your relationship with your son is long too, and what you're doing now could fuck it up forever. That might not seem like a big deal now, but it will in 20 years, I promise you that. Calm the fuck down. Chill out. And reach out to your son with the intention of listening to him.", "YTA! I think you are trying to teach your son a lesson regarding cause and effect with his decision. The reality is his current job isn\u2019t going to support him living independently and you want him to understand that but that is not how your post comes across. Maybe the better lesson would have been charging him rent so he can begin to understand the true cost of living. Too bad you just want him to fall in line instead of truly trying to meet him where he is and offer guidance.", "YTA. You sound like my dad, I don't talk to him anymore. Your kid was trying to succeed but found it depressing to live with you, and probably didn't have any income to spend on having a life outside of studying - right? That's why he wanted to work, because he was burning out studying and having no life.\n\nYou don't understand that because you're a bit socially underdeveloped - you don't know how to empathize with people and understand their perspective instead of enforcing your own. Is it possible your kid just wants to work as a barista and not a high-paying job? Yes. But is it likely? Not at all. You've just failed to empathize with him. Forget about your own opinion and find out what his is then shut the hell up until you can actually empathize with it. Then you can give fatherly advice. At this point, for him, it would be like receiving fatherly advice from an emotional stranger. He's not your son anymore and won't be again unless you show him you have changed.

This is especially relevant for his generation as their education and development has been impacted by covid.

I have a nice house that I own and am renovating, two kids, and a lovely partner who works as a barista at Starbucks. And I am happy. Why isn\u2019t your son allowed to do what makes him happy? How you live doesn\u2019t matter so long as it makes you happy. To contrast my sister has 5 years of college experience for an accounting degree. She\u2019s currently a janitor at a gym and can\u2019t find a job in her field at all. And she\u2019s living in the one place she absolutely never wanted to live because her husband is in the navy. The only reason she is renting the apartment she is is because the navy is paying most of her rent. And it\u2019s not a great place either. College doesn\u2019t make a lick of difference in your quality of life. Going after what you want from life does. Your son doesn\u2019t need college to be successful he just needs to be happy.

Sounds like you never took the time to find out what was going on with him. Maybe he would have decided to go back in a term or two - but your slash and burn approach has likely made him determined to stay clear of you. Did you consider that maybe he would rather not go with the traditional college route? Maybe a trade school would have suited him better. I know plumbers that make more than I do. And I make pretty good money. You totally disregarded his feelings and the fact that he is a young adult. This would have been the perfect opportunity to help him, but you made it about yourself... your disappointment, your money, your house \"your rules\" and belittled him for his employment.
