I guess he had expected me to forgive Stacy too because the affair was \"so long ago\". The opposite pretty much happened, and I just walked out on the wedding.\n\nThe problem with this kind of revelation that people like Tom forget is that the victim of such a sense of betrayal will datemark their experience of the trauma to the moment they found out. If you'd known four years ago it might be different, keyword \"might\", but since it's only now that you find out and it's in addition to the deception, the deliberate witholding of this information, the fact that it ruined your relationship, and you had to deal with being dumped out of no where's while someone let you vent to their face while full in the knowledge that they were responsible, it all just compounds the offense really.\n\n>It ended up causing a huge mess because I was basically running the whole show (Stacy made me do everything, so she didn't even know what was happening at certain times or who to call).\n\nYou know what the sick part about this is? So, Stacy admits to all this shit right before the wedding to \"start things fresh\" while having left everything last minute so Tom has to make a bunch of hard decisions for himself real quick. However, she also probably got you to do all this shit for herself out of some sick twisted mentality of either knowing she did this to you and is just doing it on some level to feel like she pulled one over on you, or she was using it as some thinly veiled coping mechanism of, \"if she's doing this for me it's all good, in fact she's being done an honour, so it's all square. I didn't do anything wrong.\" Like, I know I'm making a fuck load of assumptions, but the depths of bizarre rationalizations surrounding cheating really shouldn't be underestimated.\n\n>Stacy and Tom have both been slandering me online now, saying that I ruined their once in a lifetime moment. Some of their friends are on their side, saying that I should have handled the situation more privately, and at least stuck out the wedding since it was so last minute.\n\nHonestly, this was probably 90% why Stacy did this now, because you \"can't just walk out now, it's our once in a life time wedding, and everything needs you. It would be so rude. You should deal with this 'privately' and 'maturely' because adults take shit like a breeding sow all the time and just deal with it.\" Which, btw, is a fucked up mindset, but I'd place money that Stacy was doing this now specifically because sunk cost fallacy would kick in.\n\n> I heard that Stacy has been so upset she's had to take time off work, which does make me feel like an AH. Especially since I've just been ignoring her calls.\n\nOk, but why should you care? Oh no, her wedding got ruined! Such a tragedy, she's such a victim. Nothing is worse than a bride in tears\\~\n\nHowever, she's a twofaced asshole who stabbed you in the back and then probably maybe wiped her conscience clean at a tactically chosen moment of total commitment so people wouldn't deliver her the consequences that come with their contempt.\n\nAlso, given the drama they'll probably get divorced in a year or three and she can just have another one.

My ex was their friend, and I sometimes tagged along.

When her husband had to travel, she asked my ex and I to stay at hers because she didn't want to be alone. He and I were to sleep on the guest room. I was playing PS3, leaning on my ex on the bed, and she came to chat with us. They were a little drunk. She tried \"drunkenly\" coming onto me, and touched me in a way I didn't like. I pushed her and asked her to stop joking around. Both B and my ex changed their attitude, sighed, got up, and left. I felt a weird sensation in my chest and went to see where they went. They were smoking weed together in the balcony.\n2. A day where my ex and I were at B's (don't remember if the husband was around), we were getting ready to go out together. I went to the bathroom, and when I got out, B was baby-talking my ex. But, like, 2cm away from his face, body-to-body. They both turned to look at me, and looked surprised for a millisecond. She moved away from him and talked to me like nothing had happened, so I brushed it off as \"they were joking and she was mocking him\", but thought it was weird because I hadn't seen her talk like that to him before.\n\nFor context, I was 6 years younger than my ex. We started dating when I was 16-17. We broke up 3 years later. And B and husband were around his same age. Ex always dismissed my jealousy as me being crazy, always told me nothing was happening when I was mad about some interaction. Truly, I was a toxic teen in that regard, and very insecure. But he flirted around with women, and I didn't want to accept that. I should've just left instead of being jealous, but I was young and stupid. I guess getting dismissed and called crazy so much made me ignore all weird signs and think I was just imagining things.", ">and soften the blow by waiting and having her husband deliver the news.\n\nHonestly, I think she didn't expect him to spill the beans and just keep it a secret between the two of them.", "\"the wedding\" refers to OP and John's wedding, not Tom and Stacey's wedding.", "Yes, yes and yes!", "Done lol", "\u201c If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together \u2013 let them speak now or forever hold their peace.\u201d\n\n\u2018Polite cough\u2019 \u201cIf I may..\u201d", "There would be a perverse pleasure in attending the wedding just for this moment.
