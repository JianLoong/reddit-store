I thought we were pretty happy, but last year he dumped me pretty suddenly. I tried to figure out what went wrong, but he said it was \"personal\" and that I should respect his space. \n\nDuring this time, my best friend \"Stacy\" and her fianc\u00e9 \"Tom\" were my rocks, letting me crash at their place and just being overwhelmingly supportive and loving. When Stacy asked me to be her maid-of-honor, I thought it was a no-brainer and happily took on the task.\n\nFast forward to what happened this weekend: the morning of the wedding, Tom asked me to meet him for breakfast super early in the AM before all of the festivities. I thought it was weird but assumed he maybe wanted me to pass something on to Stacy. \n\nWhat happened instead was that Tom let me know that a few days prior, Stacy admitted to him that she had an affair with John, which was what lead to my breakup. He said that Stacy wanted to come clean to \"start their marriage fresh\", and that he was forgiving her to move forward. \n\nHe had gone back and forth between telling me, and finally decided to spill the beans. I guess he had expected me to forgive Stacy too because the affair was \"so long ago\". The opposite pretty much happened, and I just walked out on the wedding. \n\nIt ended up causing a huge mess because I was basically running the whole show (Stacy made me do everything, so she didn't even know what was happening at certain times or who to call). Not only that, but everyone realized that the MOH wasn't there (she had headshots and bios of the party on her wedding page), and news of the affair eventually got out because her cousin knew John. \n\nStacy and Tom have both been slandering me online now, saying that I ruined their once in a lifetime moment. Some of their friends are on their side, saying that I should have handled the situation more privately, and at least stuck out the wedding since it was so last minute. I personally don't know what Tom expected, but either way I've been getting bombarded with texts and I heard that Stacy has been so upset she's had to take time off work, which does make me feel like an AH.

Not particularly. But what on Earth did they expect would happen by telling you? And on the wedding day. They knew they were playing with fire. They chose when to tell you this information.

None of the people complaining about you on line would lift a finger for someone who ended whatever relationship they may have by being a part of an affair with their SO.\n\nStacy was deceitful, and finally faced the consequences of what she was a part of.

Why would Stacy (or any mutual friends) ever expect you to continue a charade when she was actively involved in an awful time in your life?\nSeems like her support may have been out of guilt.  \n\nAnd how could you have done it more privately?

I encourage you to speak the truth of what happened on social media. They have the audacity to say you ruined a moment in the life?!?
