I guess he had expected me to forgive Stacy too because the affair was \"so long ago\". The opposite pretty much happened, and I just walked out on the wedding.\n\nThe problem with this kind of revelation that people like Tom forget is that the victim of such a sense of betrayal will datemark their experience of the trauma to the moment they found out. If you'd known four years ago it might be different, keyword \"might\", but since it's only now that you find out and it's in addition to the deception, the deliberate witholding of this information, the fact that it ruined your relationship, and you had to deal with being dumped out of no where's while someone let you vent to their face while full in the knowledge that they were responsible, it all just compounds the offense really.\n\n>It ended up causing a huge mess because I was basically running the whole show (Stacy made me do everything, so she didn't even know what was happening at certain times or who to call).\n\nYou know what the sick part about this is? So, Stacy admits to all this shit right before the wedding to \"start things fresh\" while having left everything last minute so Tom has to make a bunch of hard decisions for himself real quick. However, she also probably got you to do all this shit for herself out of some sick twisted mentality of either knowing she did this to you and is just doing it on some level to feel like she pulled one over on you, or she was using it as some thinly veiled coping mechanism of, \"if she's doing this for me it's all good, in fact she's being done an honour, so it's all square. I didn't do anything wrong.\" Like, I know I'm making a fuck load of assumptions, but the depths of bizarre rationalizations surrounding cheating really shouldn't be underestimated.\n\n>Stacy and Tom have both been slandering me online now, saying that I ruined their once in a lifetime moment. Some of their friends are on their side, saying that I should have handled the situation more privately, and at least stuck out the wedding since it was so last minute.\n\nHonestly, this was probably 90% why Stacy did this now, because you \"can't just walk out now, it's our once in a life time wedding, and everything needs you. It would be so rude. You should deal with this 'privately' and 'maturely' because adults take shit like a breeding sow all the time and just deal with it.\" Which, btw, is a fucked up mindset, but I'd place money that Stacy was doing this now specifically because sunk cost fallacy would kick in.\n\n> I heard that Stacy has been so upset she's had to take time off work, which does make me feel like an AH. Especially since I've just been ignoring her calls.\n\nOk, but why should you care? Oh no, her wedding got ruined! Such a tragedy, she's such a victim. Nothing is worse than a bride in tears\\~\n\nHowever, she's a twofaced asshole who stabbed you in the back and then probably maybe wiped her conscience clean at a tactically chosen moment of total commitment so people wouldn't deliver her the consequences that come with their contempt.\n\nAlso, given the drama they'll probably get divorced in a year or three and she can just have another one.

It still would have gone sideways, all because the couple didn't bother to know what was happening on their own day. \n\nThat's not OPs fault. That's on the couple and if it was a hotel they should have had a single contact at the location who coordinates everything for staff and timings to feed questions to.", ">They knew they were playing with fire.

I also feel that Tom told OP the day of the wedding so the news would get out but he wasn't the one telling it.", "And what Tom did was the equivalent of giving you bad news in a crowded restaurant so you wouldn\u2019t cause a scene.

Op is so much kinder than me.", "^ I like this person. Also, NTA.", "Perfectly stated! Also wanted to point out that Tom specifically called it \"an affair.\" Not \"one time they got drunk and slept together\" and she felt terribly sick about it. Sleeping together once would be grounds enough for OP's reaction, but a WHOLE AFFAIR, full of emotions, sex and sneaking around behind Tom and OP's backs... and then to COMFORT OP in her time of confusion and heartbreak. That's an ENTIRELY different level of psychopathy.", "I don't know why you are getting downvoted. It is.", "You're getting down voted - not sure why. \n\nYou offered another reason as to why Tom chose the WEDDING day to tell OP.

Once a cheater always a cheater.", "The fact that she was OP\u2019s \u201crock\u201d while being the one to help cause the landslide is so unbelievably cruel and twisted I refuse to believe this woman has a soul. \n\nI will say I think OP missed a lot of opportunities to be petty and blow up the wedding with a killer MOH toast. \u201cTo Tom, who had the decency to tell me just hours before the wedding that the breakup they both helped me so much through was aided by none other than his beautiful wife, who slept with my ex while we were still together. Tom, I hope you can live happily with a cheating wife because they never stop at one. Cheers to you both!\u201d", "I think the part that gets me the most is Tom. You watch your \u2018fianc\u00e9\u2019 cheat, on you with her best friends partner, then watch her console her, then make her plan the wedding, while being her maid of honour. Your conscience gets the better of you enough for you to tell the friend, then you get upset when she has a reasonable response of horror at what\u2019s gone on. \n\nLike at what point do we look at this situation and say, \u2018well this is all fucked up and it ain\u2019t OPs fault. My wife\u2019s a sociopath.\u2019", "yup, I also wouldnt be surprised (not saying thats what definitely happened, just that I could see it being the case) that Tom told OP the day of to kind of 'force her' to accept it because it is so last minute and she is doing everything for them. That way OP technically couldn't say that she was tricked into doing it if they told her after the wedding. Also NTA obviously. good luck OP", "This made me lol. Unexpected, but almost certainly true! Only if Stacy changes dramatically do I have any hope for their marriage.", "The affair happened while op and her partner were planning marriage.", "Oh what she did was better, her way the whole day imploded, as it should have. NTA. The whole day  was ruined because Stacey is a cheat and Tom is pathetic. Why would you marry a cheat? Once a cheater always a cheater. And to cheat with your \u201cbest friend\u2019s\u201dbf? And then let her move in she watches her grieve like they did nothing to cause the pain. And the audacity of the both of them going after OP.  They are embarrassed that people now know Stacey is a cheater and Tom is the pathetic loser who has no self respect.", "OP was the bigger person in this situation and chose the mature option.

The cousin attending the wedding knew OP's ex (John), the beans were going to be spilled.

Lmao just to get back at Stacy. \u201cI fucked your man too girl!\u201d", "Yes 1000x.  The other option was likely be a meltdown during the wedding. Which imo would have been justified", "Down voted also but because it's word salad and I had a stroke reading it.", "You call out Tom but not Stacy, the woman who told her fianc\u00e9 she had cheated on him a few days before her wedding and didn\u2019t tell her best friend that she was responsible for their break up at all", "Close but no cigar. He should have told her the minute he found out. Waiting until after the wedding would only have prolonged OP\u2019s exploitation by her shitty friend.", "The friend should have told her a long time ago. I can't believe you're blaming the guy who was also having to come to terms with this news.  In that moment he probably felt more on the side of the op then his fiance and wasnt sure what to do.  He and the friend were both lied to for a long time. Then right before the wedding the selfish crime decides she didn't even want to hold the burden of her own guilt. \n\nI can't believe Reddit found a way to turn it on this guy when the cheating woman that couldn't tell her friend the truth caused all of this.  The cognitive dissonance modern feminism has caused is terrifying. Are women just not capable of doing anything shitty... I can't believe this post.  You don't realize it but it actually hurts women when they aren't held accountable for their actions. How do you grow character when nothing that you do wrong in life is your fault... I'm sure it was the patriarchy that tricked her into having sex with this guy and not telling her friend right?", "Tom\u2019s an even bigger AH than now if he waits until after the wedding lol are you joking?", "Why would you stay with them after your breakup. It seems their behavior in general is very disgusting. They didn\u2019t show signs of being such perverts before you moved in with them..?

Not some deep lesson in human interaction.", "Nah the saying still makes sense here. They just forgot the part where you don't tell your enemy that they are your enemy.\n\nIf Stacy kept her mouth shut the wedding would have went over without a hitch. But Stacy is also a person who only tells her fiance right before the wedding that she cheated which puts a lot of pressure on him to forgive her because otherwise he had to cancel the wedding.", "He didn\u2019t know until right before the wedding either from what I understand. He certainly should have reflected in all that but I\u2019d imagine he was in shock.", "In the comment I replied to:\n\n>No Stacy, you ruined your once in lifetime moment by cheating on Tom and fucking my boyfriend John **just before the wedding**.\n\nIn the post she said they had *started to discuss* their future.

He's the real AH here (as well as the wife, obviously)", "I read it as the wife seeing her opportunity a few days before the wedding and they both decided to tell OP the morning of because they didn\u2019t think the MOH would ditch the wedding. Guess she called their bluff.", "Oh! Absolutely. Smash the cake, dump wine on the bride. Object in the middle of the vows and out the bride. Out her during the speech. Fuck yeah! And none of that would have made her the asshole. She did it best, though.", "It's actually a psychotic trait", "Idk... it sounds like he knew for a while before the wedding. I'm guessing he thought telling her on the day of would make her less likely to cause a scene/do anything/pressure her to forgive Stacy. I might be too cynical though, but it would explain why he's acting like an AH now, slandering OP and piling on on her.", "B sounds sociopathic. They can be very charming and really able to pull the wool over one's eyes\n\nSource, I met one and had no idea till a year after.", "I was young, and felt alone while navigating all of that. It was the first time I was cheated on (that I know). She always insisted on me coming over and taking me out to distract me. I thought she was genuinely kind because she didn't mind inviting me to eat or to go out with her, even though I had told her I couldn't pay for the things she did and didn't want to inconvenience her, and because she put her friend's ex (me) as a priority over her friend (my ex).\n\nI didn't know them much before all of that. My ex was their friend, and I sometimes tagged along. The only weird things she did at two different times (and I had completely forgotten about this until some years ago, I probably blocked it in my brain), were:\n\n1. When her husband had to travel, she asked my ex and I to stay at hers because she didn't want to be alone. He and I were to sleep on the guest room. I was playing PS3, leaning on my ex on the bed, and she came to chat with us. They were a little drunk. She tried \"drunkenly\" coming onto me, and touched me in a way I didn't like. I pushed her and asked her to stop joking around. Both B and my ex changed their attitude, sighed, got up, and left. I felt a weird sensation in my chest and went to see where they went. They were smoking weed together in the balcony.\n2. A day where my ex and I were at B's (don't remember if the husband was around), we were getting ready to go out together. I went to the bathroom, and when I got out, B was baby-talking my ex. But, like, 2cm away from his face, body-to-body. They both turned to look at me, and looked surprised for a millisecond. She moved away from him and talked to me like nothing had happened, so I brushed it off as \"they were joking and she was mocking him\", but thought it was weird because I hadn't seen her talk like that to him before.\n\nFor context, I was 6 years younger than my ex. We started dating when I was 16-17. We broke up 3 years later. And B and husband were around his same age. Ex always dismissed my jealousy as me being crazy, always told me nothing was happening when I was mad about some interaction. Truly, I was a toxic teen in that regard, and very insecure. But he flirted around with women, and I didn't want to accept that. I should've just left instead of being jealous, but I was young and stupid. I guess getting dismissed and called crazy so much made me ignore all weird signs and think I was just imagining things.", ">and soften the blow by waiting and having her husband deliver the news.\n\nHonestly, I think she didn't expect him to spill the beans and just keep it a secret between the two of them.", "\"the wedding\" refers to OP and John's wedding, not Tom and Stacey's wedding.", "Yes, yes and yes!", "Done lol", "\u201c If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together \u2013 let them speak now or forever hold their peace.\u201d\n\n\u2018Polite cough\u2019 \u201cIf I may..\u201d", "There would be a perverse pleasure in attending the wedding just for this moment.

Though this would take work it would probably cost a lot less then the lawyers fees trying to get an annulment and a potential divorce.", "Honestly it seems like Stacy told him just a few days before the wedding because she probably assumed that at such short notice he wouldn't have time to think clearly, and would just go through with it because of all the momentum behind a wedding.
