I guess he had expected me to forgive Stacy too because the affair was \"so long ago\". The opposite pretty much happened, and I just walked out on the wedding.\n\nThe problem with this kind of revelation that people like Tom forget is that the victim of such a sense of betrayal will datemark their experience of the trauma to the moment they found out. If you'd known four years ago it might be different, keyword \"might\", but since it's only now that you find out and it's in addition to the deception, the deliberate witholding of this information, the fact that it ruined your relationship, and you had to deal with being dumped out of no where's while someone let you vent to their face while full in the knowledge that they were responsible, it all just compounds the offense really.\n\n>It ended up causing a huge mess because I was basically running the whole show (Stacy made me do everything, so she didn't even know what was happening at certain times or who to call).\n\nYou know what the sick part about this is? So, Stacy admits to all this shit right before the wedding to \"start things fresh\" while having left everything last minute so Tom has to make a bunch of hard decisions for himself real quick. However, she also probably got you to do all this shit for herself out of some sick twisted mentality of either knowing she did this to you and is just doing it on some level to feel like she pulled one over on you, or she was using it as some thinly veiled coping mechanism of, \"if she's doing this for me it's all good, in fact she's being done an honour, so it's all square. I didn't do anything wrong.\" Like, I know I'm making a fuck load of assumptions, but the depths of bizarre rationalizations surrounding cheating really shouldn't be underestimated.\n\n>Stacy and Tom have both been slandering me online now, saying that I ruined their once in a lifetime moment. Some of their friends are on their side, saying that I should have handled the situation more privately, and at least stuck out the wedding since it was so last minute.\n\nHonestly, this was probably 90% why Stacy did this now, because you \"can't just walk out now, it's our once in a life time wedding, and everything needs you. It would be so rude. You should deal with this 'privately' and 'maturely' because adults take shit like a breeding sow all the time and just deal with it.\" Which, btw, is a fucked up mindset, but I'd place money that Stacy was doing this now specifically because sunk cost fallacy would kick in.\n\n> I heard that Stacy has been so upset she's had to take time off work, which does make me feel like an AH. Especially since I've just been ignoring her calls.\n\nOk, but why should you care? Oh no, her wedding got ruined! Such a tragedy, she's such a victim. Nothing is worse than a bride in tears\\~\n\nHowever, she's a twofaced asshole who stabbed you in the back and then probably maybe wiped her conscience clean at a tactically chosen moment of total commitment so people wouldn't deliver her the consequences that come with their contempt.\n\nAlso, given the drama they'll probably get divorced in a year or three and she can just have another one. Weddings are the most repeatable \"one time event\" in modern society.\n\nNTA", "Those are wild mental gymnastics those people are doing.  \n\n\nWalking out on the wedding WAS the private way of handling things.
