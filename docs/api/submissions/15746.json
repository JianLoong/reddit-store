June really liked him...a lot...so much she said, 'I love him! If I wasn't married to Advanced - Stress, I'd marry Ben'. it was weird to me but I shrugged it off as an overly nice compliment. then they started happening more. all four of us had a double date night and we talked about how Alex and I like to live in present and focus on the now, while June and Ben like to think a lot about the future. June said we should do a SO swap, because it seems her and Ben would get a long so well.\n\nI finally talked to her about these comments after our sex life declined. She refuses sex and has made comments my body disgust her and maybe my weight it why we can't have a kid. she then told me, along with Alex, she imagines the sex is great with ben because he has such a great body. I told June these comments were uncomfortable for everyone, i'd appreciate it if she stopped as they're impacting how I view myself and if it's a body issue I can work towards losing weight but this isn't the way to do it. She said she knows, she knows.\n\nhere's where the situation comes into play. We had another double date and the comments about Ben happened again. June pretty much implied if there's ever a day both are single let her know. Ben looked at her and said, 'I could never been with someone so ugly on the inside and outside. have some respect for my girlfriend. I hate being around you I just came to support Alex.'
