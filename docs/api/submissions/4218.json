A week delay in her final hospital stay wasn't the reason she died, she died because the cancer prevailed.\n\nGrieving is not a reason to shit stir.   The people who should be apologizing are these nasty relatives.", "NTA - if your family is making up stories to place blame, then correcting them doesn\u2019t make you an AH. That is a very toxic way to grieve and they need to grow up and get professional help.", "You\u2019re not even close to being the asshole. Your family must be dumb as rocks to think that your grandpa (who was dealing with his own chemo) could do anything to prevent your grandma from dying of cancer.", "NTA.\n\nWe all have our own way of grieving but scapegoating the widower is a pretty low thing to do.", "Absolutely NTA! You were completely justified in defending your grandpa. It is cruel and unfair to blame him for something that he could not have prevented. You showed that you are strong and willing to stand up for what you believe in, and you should be proud of yourself", "Yikes your familys way of greiving is to blame others for their death just yikes", "NTA, nah that is just wrong, your family accused him of killing her, they are not grieving wtf. This is so sad, your poor grandpa i feel really bad for him. Good that you stood up for him!!", "NTA. Very disrespectful for them to be so insulting", "NTA.\n\nAlso, never apologize if you did what you believe was right, not even just to settle family drama. If you do that enough you end up surrounded by assholes.", "INFO\n\nNo way to really judge this unless you explain why your family felt that way / what specifically they said your grandma should have done but didn't do.", "NTA. During stressful times it's common for old resentments and insecurities to come out. It's even happened in my family, who you'd normally think were wax figures because we're not exactly an emotive bunch. But some families have this weird thing where, whenever something bad happens, they have to blame someone. Really unfortunate that you've got these two dynamics feeding into one another here.", "NTA!  In fact, you are an angel for standing up for him!  How sad that others would blame him for a death he had no control over!  My own dad died of metastatic lung cancer and nothing could have saved him!  This also touches a nerve because when I lost my husband to suicide, his family shunned us, likely believing I should have seen it coming.  I did NOT, and I'd have given anything to have been able to save him!  He was my whole world.  So I know the pain your grandfather must feel when being blamed for something that was not his fault.\n\nYou are a wonderful granddaughter to him, and I am so proud of you for standing by him!  So sorry for your loss, by the way.  \\*hugs\\*", "NTA.  Tell them that making up stories to place blame on another person for the death is the opposite if grieving and just toxic and evil behavior and they can all F off for an apology as that is about all they deserve in that regard.  If anything they feel guilt for not doing enough themselves and are attempting to redirect this over to someone else not deserving of it.", "NTA the only asshole is cancer and those believing you had any control over it. I'm sorry for your loss and hope those that blame you for it step on Legos forever", "Definitely NTA!? How on earth is he meant to cure cancer!?", "To be clear, they're not providing any evidence to back up their claims, just saying that they grieve by blaming somebody because someone died of cancer? NTA and good for you for sticking up for your grandpa. Please continue to spend time with him, especially if nobody else will; I'm sure he's also grieving a lot over the loss of his wife.", "NTA - OK, there is grieving and then there are lunatic accusations abusing a sick old man who has just lost his spouse to cancer--WTAF is **wrong** with those people?!?!  Apologize?  I'm sorry, but I'd still be laying into them. (Actually, not sorry at all.)  I hope your grandfather has good care and is being looked after.  All you can do now is to be there for him.  INFO: Now that I re-read your post, this whole thing happened 2-3 years ago?  Is this still going on or what?", "Frick no, you're NTA. Good on you for standing up for him. That family should feel ashamed of themselves. \n\nMy blood is boiling on yours, and your grandpas behalf. Poor guy. He's dealing with cancer while taking care of his wife with cancer, lost her so now he's alone. Then the family accuses him of killing her furthering his isolation while sick.\n\nOP, they deserve so much worse.", "NTA\n\nEspecially with your family\u2019s rationale on why you\u2019re \u201cwrong\u201d. Clearly you were grieving as well, so their logic is completely flawed. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m really confused as to why they are now lashing out at you you. Why now?", "OP \n\nAre your parents like outer space aliens? Because there is no place on this planet where blaming the spouse is ok and an acceptable \"way of grieving.\"  Like maybe on Mars this is ok, but not here. Don't you dare apologize. \n\nNTA not even a little. Glad you have your grandpa's back.", "I didn\u2019t know your Grandpa had the cure for cancer.\n\nNTA.", "NTA Grieving does not involve anyone other that the deceased.  Everyone dies.

Nothing could have saved her, and at stage 4, nothing could help your grandma either. Your family is cruel for what they are doing and deserved to be called out. Do not apologize and stay by your grandpa's side. NTA", "OP this right here. Grieving is a process of coming to terms with someones death. Blaming your Gpa isn't coming to terms it's passing the buck. Don't apologize, tell them they need to apologize to your Gpa for being awful people when he was in critical need of family support.", "Yep. A week would not have saved her. Her cancer was so severe that doctors literally told her they had no clue how she is still alive...and my family knew that.", "That's just heartbreaking. The poor man.", "They are mad because they found out my grandma didn't go to the hospital as soon as her breathing problems started. My grandma wanted to wait about a week for her doctor to get back from vacation but my grandpa convinced her to go to urgent care. As for my family the most likely reason they jumped on my grandpa is because he is technically a step father/grandfather making it easy for them to attack him.", "Yes, they have and had no evidence. They knew to some degree that my grandma was already sick.  Once in the hospital my grandpa made sure that everyone was aware of everything. He was open and honest about what happened and what will happen to her. When she was alive they accepted that but it wasn't until her death that they suddenly had a problem. Most likely because they knew my grandma would rip them a new one for treating her best friend like that.", "Because one of my cousins who still talks to me asked me to come down for Christmas with my boyfriend so they can meet him.

I am aware of bullying. \n\nBut whatever is going on with your family isn't relevant here. My response only applies to this story. \n\nWhat we do know is perhaps OP doesn't have the full story. Maybe she does maybe she doesn't. Bur she was a teenager when this happened. Two grandparents are dying and its possible the older generation shielded her from everything that tooks place. Two grandparents with severe illness are going to have so many issues going on. \n\nThere may be more to the story. There might not be. We don't know. Which is why I didn't make a judgement. No harm no foul.", "She just told you why they are mad, heck you responded to OP's explanation of why they are mad. I've seen a ton of families turn on one person when it's no fault of their own. Unless you're a family member who has tea to share all we can go on is what OP did explain if you read. She went to the hospital a week after she was having breathing problems not that moment.  That is what the family is gossiping about, that is what she was speaking to was rumors no one hid from her. Rumors that are so bad they have an old man who lost his love having anxiety.  Plus he also probably feels like crap because he couldn't get her there sooner, may even blame himself without their help. Their issue and rumors they are starting is what she addressed, I firmly believe the OP has it right and unless you have some Tea to spill you won't make me think he is the bad guy. Period. Family sucks here sorry not sorry they are tearing down an old man under the guise of grieving, unacceptable.", "No the rest of your family are assholes for putting the blame on a person instead of the lung cancer itself. Wtf is wrong with people.", "NTA.  My father's cousin accused my mother and I of killing my 103-year-old grandmother, and we immediately went NC with her.  (Her \"logic\" was that Grandma could easily have lived to 120, so clearly there was something suspicious.)  These people are not worth your time, and grieving is no excuse for their comments."]}
