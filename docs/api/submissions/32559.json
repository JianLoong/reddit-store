Please accept both my congratulations and condolences. It took me many, many years of interacting with family after leaving our cult to realize that nothing would ever be the same with them again. \n\nYou have left, and for good reasons. Family is not going to see that or accept it as long as they are still in the midst of cult thinking. Family is going to want you back in the cult. Pretending is going to leave them with hope that they will act on. \n\nYou have enough on your plate right now with trying to make this transition as easy as possible on your son. I'd focus on him and not worry about demanding adults who don't understand the changes you are making in your life. You clearly don't want to raise him in a cult. Stick to that. Give yourself time to figure out what family interaction in the future will look like. Also, please see if you can find a therapist who specializes in cult issues sooner rather than later. You'd be surprised what gets in one's head and lingers. Best wishes to you.  NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
