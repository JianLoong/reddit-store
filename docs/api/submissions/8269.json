I've been in her life for 8 years and we have full custody. She sees her momma once every other week. I also have 2 sons, aged 11 and 9. \n\nFor the past like 6 months or so my step daughter will stand right directly behind me whenever I'm cooking anything. She doesn't want to help me cook. I've asked and she said no because she's afraid of getting burnt. She just stands directly behind or beside me close enough that we are touching whenever I'm cooking and it's incredibly frustrating. Our kitchen is small as it is so I have no room to move. I started telling her to stay out of the kitchen when I'm cooking because I need space and I'm becoming frustrated from either dropping things constantly because I'm tripping over her or constantly having to ask her to move out of the way. Ever since I started telling her to stay out of the kitchen when I'm cooking she has been making excuses to be in there. Like getting a drink every 5 minutes or wanting to color at the counter versus having her own huge desk in her bedroom or even using the office desk in the living room. If she wanted to learn to cook and help me that would be one thing. I would be more than willing to teach her! But as I said, she's refused and doesn't want to help me. She just insists on standing right on my heels and watching what I'm doing. Can't even express how many times I have almost burnt her and HAVE burnt myself because of this. \n\nSo yesterday she came in after I told her not to and I didn't hear her come in. She was standing right behind me. I went to turn to strain noodles and bumped in to her and got boiling water all down my front and all over the floor. I did yell and tell her to get out now. She ran to her room crying. My husband immediately started berating me for hurting her feelings \"simply because she's fucking curious\". I explained to him the same shit I have a million times before, she is not to be in the kitchen anymore when I'm cooking because I'm exhausted from constantly tripping over her when she has zero intentions to help or learn. I explained that because of her I just burnt the fuck out of myself and he just completely ignored it and said I'm the one in the wrong because of her feelings. AITA? -and yes, I've spoken to her several times after I've been burnt in the past. She just says \"sorry\" and continues to do it.", "created_utc": 1674678748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l8w48/aita_for_not_letting_my_step_daughter_in_the/", "score": 354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were hurt because the boiling water spilled over you; but, that water could have easily spilled over her face and neck.  \n\nAs an adult, sit down at a time other than when you're cooking and ask her if there is anything wrong/bothering her.  Let her know because of kitchen safety she Can't be in the kitchen when you're cooking period.  Not getting drinks, not coloring, not lurking like a post-it note on your butt when your back is turned.\n\nNext time you're cooking, if she's behind you - leave the pots on the burners, turn the burners off, take out bread and lunchmeat to set on the table and tell your husband/step-daughter that you refuse to put her safety and yours at risk because she won't stay out of the kitchen while you're trying to cook...and repeat until they both get it.", "NTA\n\nThat is extremely dangerous and frankly very irresponsible of your husband.\n\nShe's 10 and plenty old enough to not risk injuring or getting herself injured due to cooking accidents.

I\u2019d sit her down and have a conversation about why she is scared of being burnt, and then tell her how you\u2019ve been burnt because she\u2019s in the kitchen and you\u2019re avoiding burning her. \n\nMaybe ask if she wants to be involved in the prep.", "NTA\n\nThis is a real problem. Your husband needs to snap out   of it. Tell him to cook with her there. If she doesn't do the same things, you'll know it's a bigger thing. 10 yrs is old enough to understand the safety reasons you are trying to explain to her.", "NTA from now on, if she walks in, everything stops - turn the stove off, put the knife down, no exceptions - until she leaves. I\u2019d also try to have a conversation outside of cooking time when you are both calm to figure out what she is going for here? Is it spending time with you? Is it actually the cooking process? Maybe you can set up something else to satisfy that need.  And if your husband won\u2019t back you up, I\u2019d probably switch to 24/7 sandwiches or stop cooking altogether.", "NTA. But it's time for you to have a long conversation with your husband about how YOU are getting yourself hurt, and if she keeps doing it, you will no longer cook. You will get seriously hurt because of this.\n\nAlso, I think it's time to ask her why she is doing this. If she can't tell you, tell her she is hurting you and that is dangerous for you.

Next time she's in the kitchen ask her to help or leave. If she says no and refuses to leave then turn everything off,  and leave. Her father can finish cooking while tripping all over her. All dinners can be bread slices with a slice of cheese slapped between them until further notice.", "NTA. Her behavior is causing other people injury and could potentially cause her injury. Her getting her curiosity satisfied should not come at the price of you being physically injured.

Yelling is a reaction to pain. You didn\u2019t curse or insult her. Having a kid cling to me while cooking gives me such anxiety. I kick everyone out of my kitchen unless they are helping. \n\nWant your husband to support you on this? Go on a cooking strike.

It seems to me that she wants some motherly affection, but she may not have the words or confidence to ask. \n\nPerhaps you can reset with her, and explain kitchen safety again and set the boundary, while reassuring her that \u201cx time is for us to hang out together\u201d?", "NTA. Have your husband do all the cooking when she won\u2019t leave you alone. I would stop and not cook anything, he could do it from now on.", "you\u2019re not an asshole in my eyes at all. it\u2019s insane for your husband to even get mad at you because you yelled at the girl out of frustration. like i\u2019m sorry that i didn\u2019t calmly ask her to give me space after burning myself even though i\u2019ve warned her multiple times to not get in the way???", "NTA. The only time kids are allowed in my kitchen while I'm cooking, is if they're helping. I trip over my dog enough while cooking, that I don't need added obstacles. Also if I got burnt repeatedly because of a child, I'd stop cooking and make sandwiches or my husband can cook dinner.", "NTA, there were real consequences to her disregard of your safety. That being said, telling kids no only works if you're consistent in reinforcing that no - it sounds like even if she's on your heels, nothing has been done to truly stop her, so she thinks no is a light suggestion. \n\nSet strong boundaries and physically remove her in the future, don't let her just stand there - ex, only helpers can be in the kitchen from now on, if you can't help, you need to leave. \n\nCan you put up a baby gate for the kitchen, a physical blocker to stop the impulse to come in and watch or watch from a safe distance? Or can you place a chair near the kitchen that she is to stay at if she's going to be in the kitchen at all?", "Put a baby gate at the entrance of the kitchen.", "NTA\n\nShe is doing something that has already resulted in bodily harm. It can get much worse!\n\nif your husband is feeling all self-righteous in his feelings let him cook for a week or two with his daughter standing right behind him.\n\nI bet he will change his tune in 2 days.", "NTA. You have two solutions. Option 1, stop cooking. Your husband can deal with it. He must have plenty of free time since he isn\u2019t watching his daughter. Option 2, next time this happens, spill it on her, stop trying to protect her. She doesn\u2019t want to get burned, she needs to get out.", "The exact same thing happens to me, but instead of a step daughter, it is with my dog (7F). It is super annoying and I have tripped on her and spilled food on more than one occasion. Perhaps this was her plan all along?\n\nI would suggest never giving your step daughter treats in the kitchen, and if some food does fall to the floor, grab it quick before she can get it. Doing this might cause her to lose interest. Despite the fact that this approach has not yet worked with my dog, I believe the idea to be sound.", "NTA she could get badly hurt if she is just in the way. Happened to my nephew and he got boiling water on him and he ended up needing skin grafts, to say nothing of the psychological damage.", "NTA \n\nI don't even let my husband in the kitchen when I'm cooking because it's so narrow and it's just too stressful. I definitely don't let my kiddos be under my feet. If we're cooking together, and communicating well, then they can participate. The biggest reason by far is that it's a safety hazard. But honestly, it's also super frustrating to be trying to complete a task with someone always getting in the way. Especially if you have certain kitchen layouts where you're always on top of each other. \n\nI love my family, and love that they want to hang with me. But if I'm making a meal, they can still be very present while staying out of the danger zone. If they can't keep themselves out of the way, then they need to go for my sanity and their safety. \n\nYour stepdaughter's curiosity does not trump safety. She can pull up a chair and stay out of the way. She can sit at the entrance to the kitchen and talk to you from a safe place. But being under your feet around hot surfaces, sharp knives, you're distracted because your focus is on the tasks you're completing, it all adds up to a safety hazard and she needs to learn to respect you, your space, and safety. Curiosity, her boredom, whatever doesn't override that.", "NTA Holy crap.your husband is a complete AH. You BURNED yourself and he criticized your TONE?  No wonder your stepdaughter has issues. But here's the thing, she wants to be with you. She wants to be close to you and learn from you. That is amazing. So after you show her your blisters and explain how unsafe standing behind you has been, can you let her watch from the door and include her by talking about what you're doing? Much love to you as negotiate this dangerous situation in a loving way.", "NTA\n\nBut I think she is curious just afraid to actually participate. There is a legit safety concern with her getting in the way. She could watch from a distance but I guess at 10 she has trouble following the rules or understanding why you need space. I would kinda expect she would have learned the issue if it was an on going thing.\n\nMaybe try to teach her stuff she could do safely. Like \"you can be in here but you have to stay behind the caution line and help with X.\" If she can't follow the rules then she needs to wait until she's more responsible.", "NTA and honestly I'd start handing out some ultimatums. If she walks into the kitchen while you're cooking you turn everything off and leave the room. Or just stop cooking at altogether. She and your husband get cereal or peanut butter sandwiches for every single meal. Or announce that everyone is now responsible for their own meals and you will no longer be cooking for them as they don't respect you or care about your safety. You can't force her to tell you why she really wants to be in the kitchen and you can't force her to help or learn to cook if she truly doesn't want to, so if she refuses to stop this ridiculous behavior you'll stop it yourself. No more cooking until the walking safety hazard learns to keep out of the way.", "Nope NTA. That is unsafe as has been shown. Have your husband do all the cooking for a while and let him deal with her hovering behind him. Maybe he would change his tune. Standing there for no reason isn't okay. Maybe a chair in a corner so she can watch?", "NTA, after reading your comments she may indeed be bored, so you have two choices either assign her a household chore to do or stop cooking until she and takes the hint that her presence in the kitchen is dangerous and not welcomed during cooking time.", "NTA stop cooking", "Maybe you could try something like, you can be here when I cook but ONLY in this particular spot \u2014 obviously, out of the way.  That way, she could still be there, but both of you are safe.", "NTA\n\nI have an easy solution: your husband is going to be the family cook instead.\n\nBelieve me he will sine learn why you don't want behind you in the kitchen.", "NTA your husband is for not teaching his kid to respect people's CLEARLY ESTABLISHED boundaries.", "NTA stop cooking your husband can cook since he thinks he can handle it better", "NTA.  Put her to work. Anyone in the kitchen is to help you. Make it go for everyone. And then see if she wants to be there.", "NTA she should be allowed in the kitchen but not allowed to hang out right behind you.  Do you know why she wants to be in there?  Does she want to be near you, is she curious about the cooking, or is she trying to bother you?\n\nIf she wants to be in there for a good reason tell her you're afraid you will fall on her or spill something hot on her, give her a special stool or chair to sit on while you're cooking.  Try to give her small tasks if she's willing, like handing you the butter out of the refrigerator.  Maybe that will draw her into helping more.", "INFO: Did you explain to her that if she is scared of being burned, standing right behind you is the most dangerous place in a kitchen?\n\nSimply telling her to get out wasn't enough if you didn't explain exactly besides \"it's frustrating\"", "NTA. my only solution is to possibly face time her while you\u2019re cooking? that way she can watch but not be in the way ?", "NTA. Get a baby gate that has a latch she wouldn't be able to open and is high enough that she can't climb over it and use it to block the entrance to the kitchen when you are cooking.", "NTA. Although you can try handling it some other way. If love as well as yelling is not working, try welcoming her into the kitchen. Get a kids chair with a strap-on lock and make her watch you cook.", "It sounds like she really likes to be around you, have you tried setting her up in the kitchen in a designated spot? If I was a little kid and I wanted to be around a parent who I admired and they kept rejecting me I know it would sting. Now I understand the frustration as I have three kids myself and they're usually pretty oblivious when they're in the way, but I've never considered banning them from the kitchen. If they're in the way let em know, about to move a hot pot? Doesn't hurt to look at your surroundings and let em know you're about to move some boiling water and someone can get hurt. It can't be harder than a pet walking by, as you can communicate with your child way easier. Remember you're teaching them how to react when you react. Sit her down and have a conversation about both of you trying to be more mindful of your surroundings when in the kitchen, so everyone can be safe. Personal space is also a good discussion to have. It sounds like you're a much bigger influence in her life than you may realize. Sometimes standing behind someone and getting a negative reaction is better than getting no reaction from nobody. I could be wrong about all of this but in my experience kids do pretty silly stuff like this when they don't know how to properly communicate their feelings.\n\nI wouldn't say YTA, but it seems like there's possibly some reasons she's doing this you may want to investigate further. I'm not sure about the relationship with her mother but I can't imagine only seeing your mother once every other week leads to the most healthy development, and more than likely you're now filling that role. It's okay to get frustrated and feel like you have, and its even easier to overlook things like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Perhaps you should serve sandwiches and cereal for a week, and explain that you've decided to limit the dinner menu to what can safely be prepared. You're not going to continue to risk your's and daughter's safety since the family can't agree on following the kitchen rules. Until these rules can be followed, you have to think about everyone's well-being.\n\nAlso, I think you should sit down with step daughter, just the two of you, and have a conversation with her about why she wants to be so close to you all of a sudden. It seems like she may seeking attention from, or wanting quality time with you but doesn't know how to properly communicate that need. Her wanting to watch/do activities in your presence to me sounds like her primary interest is spending time with you. She also might secretly be interested in learning, which is why she insists on being present, but is still too scared/intimidated to vocalize her actual interest.

It was very weird and at the time none of us understood why she would do it. She eventually grew out of it about when she was 16, I think it's some kind of bonding thing or she was trying and just didn't understand how, her mom married my FIL and she came from a broken household. I don't know, but I understand where you are coming from and I think you are nta. Maybe try talking to her about the need to be so close.", "NTA\n\nHowever I think it's a good time to involve her mom if possible and ask what their kitchen time looks like. Does she do similar behaviors? Have there been discussions of how to be safe in the kitchen? I think if you haven't already it's also an appropriate time to talk about \"punishments\", or expectations for immediate response reactions (when something dangerous or potentially dangerous happens what're the expectations for you to react with?)\n\nI'd also take the time to check in with your partner when neither of you are upset, involve all the kids in the house and talk about kitchen safety, and how to respond to when fears come up.", "NTA but... I think she want to be close to you, want your company and love. A lot of kids go through similar phases. \n\nI understand that she is in your way and you need to keep both of you safe, but can you give her other little jobs she could do to help (e.g. setting up the table?). \n\nIn regards to the incident, I understand why you shouted at her, it could have been very bad. She was probably scared too. I think it is important that you talk to her once every thing is a bit more quiet. Apologies for screaming, explain that you still love her but you got hurt, and this is why it is important to follow the rules in the kitchen so that people don't get hurt... I would also have a chat with her about why she want to be in the kitchen with you. She might not know, but I suspect it is also in part due to her relationship with her mother and what is lacking from it. It could also that she want to learn by observing and is interested in cooking but is too scared about burning herself.\n\nMaybe offer to do some cooking together (make sure you set a specific day) to make something simple so that she can slowly work up the courage to do things that are a bit more challenging.

Is there anyway you could or would be willing to let her help with simple tasks like breaking up the lettuce for salad, buttering the rolls, or taking stems off the strawberries, etc, even maybe start out small with cutting soft things with a butter knife and work her way up from prep to cooking slowly to help build her confidence? \n\nIt\u2019s a good skill for the kids to learn and it\u2019s not to early to start teaching them.", "NTA.

Not enough to do colouring or whatever, but I often found giving them a small task helped a lot. It's my general rule for kids being Too Much - ask them to help you. Not quite bored=chores but engaging them.\n\nUpside is I have a kid who helps out in the kitchen all the time now, has good spatial awareness, and helps out at other houses too. But it took YEARS and a lot of minor injuries to get there.\n\nSo I'd emphasise, family meeting style, that being burned HURT but also scared the shit out of you because it was only your reaction time that saved the kid from being on the burns ward.
