I've been in her life for 8 years and we have full custody. She sees her momma once every other week. I also have 2 sons, aged 11 and 9. \n\nFor the past like 6 months or so my step daughter will stand right directly behind me whenever I'm cooking anything. She doesn't want to help me cook. I've asked and she said no because she's afraid of getting burnt. She just stands directly behind or beside me close enough that we are touching whenever I'm cooking and it's incredibly frustrating. Our kitchen is small as it is so I have no room to move. I started telling her to stay out of the kitchen when I'm cooking because I need space and I'm becoming frustrated from either dropping things constantly because I'm tripping over her or constantly having to ask her to move out of the way. Ever since I started telling her to stay out of the kitchen when I'm cooking she has been making excuses to be in there. Like getting a drink every 5 minutes or wanting to color at the counter versus having her own huge desk in her bedroom or even using the office desk in the living room. If she wanted to learn to cook and help me that would be one thing. I would be more than willing to teach her! But as I said, she's refused and doesn't want to help me. She just insists on standing right on my heels and watching what I'm doing. Can't even express how many times I have almost burnt her and HAVE burnt myself because of this. \n\nSo yesterday she came in after I told her not to and I didn't hear her come in. She was standing right behind me. I went to turn to strain noodles and bumped in to her and got boiling water all down my front and all over the floor. I did yell and tell her to get out now. She ran to her room crying. My husband immediately started berating me for hurting her feelings \"simply because she's fucking curious\". I explained to him the same shit I have a million times before, she is not to be in the kitchen anymore when I'm cooking because I'm exhausted from constantly tripping over her when she has zero intentions to help or learn. I explained that because of her I just burnt the fuck out of myself and he just completely ignored it and said I'm the one in the wrong because of her feelings. AITA? -and yes, I've spoken to her several times after I've been burnt in the past. She just says \"sorry\" and continues to do it.", "created_utc": 1674678748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l8w48/aita_for_not_letting_my_step_daughter_in_the/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were hurt because the boiling water spilled over you; but, that water could have easily spilled over her face and neck.  \n\nAs an adult, sit down at a time other than when you're cooking and ask her if there is anything wrong/bothering her.  Let her know because of kitchen safety she Can't be in the kitchen when you're cooking period.  Not getting drinks, not coloring, not lurking like a post-it note on your butt when your back is turned.\n\nNext time you're cooking, if she's behind you - leave the pots on the burners, turn the burners off, take out bread and lunchmeat to set on the table and tell your husband/step-daughter that you refuse to put her safety and yours at risk because she won't stay out of the kitchen while you're trying to cook...and repeat until they both get it.", "NTA\n\nThat is extremely dangerous and frankly very irresponsible of your husband.\n\nShe's 10 and plenty old enough to not risk injuring or getting herself injured due to cooking accidents.

I\u2019d sit her down and have a conversation about why she is scared of being burnt, and then tell her how you\u2019ve been burnt because she\u2019s in the kitchen and you\u2019re avoiding burning her. \n\nMaybe ask if she wants to be involved in the prep.", "NTA\n\nThis is a real problem. Your husband needs to snap out   of it. Tell him to cook with her there. If she doesn't do the same things, you'll know it's a bigger thing. 10 yrs is old enough to understand the safety reasons you are trying to explain to her.", "NTA from now on, if she walks in, everything stops - turn the stove off, put the knife down, no exceptions - until she leaves. I\u2019d also try to have a conversation outside of cooking time when you are both calm to figure out what she is going for here? Is it spending time with you? Is it actually the cooking process? Maybe you can set up something else to satisfy that need.  And if your husband won\u2019t back you up, I\u2019d probably switch to 24/7 sandwiches or stop cooking altogether.", "NTA. But it's time for you to have a long conversation with your husband about how YOU are getting yourself hurt, and if she keeps doing it, you will no longer cook. You will get seriously hurt because of this.\n\nAlso, I think it's time to ask her why she is doing this. If she can't tell you, tell her she is hurting you and that is dangerous for you.

Yelling is a reaction to pain. You didn\u2019t curse or insult her. Having a kid cling to me while cooking gives me such anxiety. I kick everyone out of my kitchen unless they are helping. \n\nWant your husband to support you on this? Go on a cooking strike.

It seems to me that she wants some motherly affection, but she may not have the words or confidence to ask. \n\nPerhaps you can reset with her, and explain kitchen safety again and set the boundary, while reassuring her that \u201cx time is for us to hang out together\u201d?", "NTA. Have your husband do all the cooking when she won\u2019t leave you alone. I would stop and not cook anything, he could do it from now on.", "you\u2019re not an asshole in my eyes at all. it\u2019s insane for your husband to even get mad at you because you yelled at the girl out of frustration. like i\u2019m sorry that i didn\u2019t calmly ask her to give me space after burning myself even though i\u2019ve warned her multiple times to not get in the way???", "NTA. The only time kids are allowed in my kitchen while I'm cooking, is if they're helping. I trip over my dog enough while cooking, that I don't need added obstacles. Also if I got burnt repeatedly because of a child, I'd stop cooking and make sandwiches or my husband can cook dinner.", "NTA, there were real consequences to her disregard of your safety. That being said, telling kids no only works if you're consistent in reinforcing that no - it sounds like even if she's on your heels, nothing has been done to truly stop her, so she thinks no is a light suggestion. \n\nSet strong boundaries and physically remove her in the future, don't let her just stand there - ex, only helpers can be in the kitchen from now on, if you can't help, you need to leave. \n\nCan you put up a baby gate for the kitchen, a physical blocker to stop the impulse to come in and watch or watch from a safe distance? Or can you place a chair near the kitchen that she is to stay at if she's going to be in the kitchen at all?", "Put a baby gate at the entrance of the kitchen.", "NTA\n\nShe is doing something that has already resulted in bodily harm. It can get much worse!\n\nif your husband is feeling all self-righteous in his feelings let him cook for a week or two with his daughter standing right behind him.\n\nI bet he will change his tune in 2 days.", "NTA. You have two solutions. Option 1, stop cooking. Your husband can deal with it. He must have plenty of free time since he isn\u2019t watching his daughter. Option 2, next time this happens, spill it on her, stop trying to protect her. She doesn\u2019t want to get burned, she needs to get out.", "The exact same thing happens to me, but instead of a step daughter, it is with my dog (7F). It is super annoying and I have tripped on her and spilled food on more than one occasion. Perhaps this was her plan all along?\n\nI would suggest never giving your step daughter treats in the kitchen, and if some food does fall to the floor, grab it quick before she can get it. Doing this might cause her to lose interest. Despite the fact that this approach has not yet worked with my dog, I believe the idea to be sound.", "NTA she could get badly hurt if she is just in the way. Happened to my nephew and he got boiling water on him and he ended up needing skin grafts, to say nothing of the psychological damage.", "NTA \n\nI don't even let my husband in the kitchen when I'm cooking because it's so narrow and it's just too stressful. I definitely don't let my kiddos be under my feet. If we're cooking together, and communicating well, then they can participate. The biggest reason by far is that it's a safety hazard. But honestly, it's also super frustrating to be trying to complete a task with someone always getting in the way. Especially if you have certain kitchen layouts where you're always on top of each other. \n\nI love my family, and love that they want to hang with me. But if I'm making a meal, they can still be very present while staying out of the danger zone. If they can't keep themselves out of the way, then they need to go for my sanity and their safety. \n\nYour stepdaughter's curiosity does not trump safety. She can pull up a chair and stay out of the way. She can sit at the entrance to the kitchen and talk to you from a safe place. But being under your feet around hot surfaces, sharp knives, you're distracted because your focus is on the tasks you're completing, it all adds up to a safety hazard and she needs to learn to respect you, your space, and safety. Curiosity, her boredom, whatever doesn't override that.", "NTA Holy crap.your husband is a complete AH. You BURNED yourself and he criticized your TONE?  No wonder your stepdaughter has issues. But here's the thing, she wants to be with you. She wants to be close to you and learn from you. That is amazing. So after you show her your blisters and explain how unsafe standing behind you has been, can you let her watch from the door and include her by talking about what you're doing? Much love to you as negotiate this dangerous situation in a loving way.", "NTA\n\nBut I think she is curious just afraid to actually participate. There is a legit safety concern with her getting in the way. She could watch from a distance but I guess at 10 she has trouble following the rules or understanding why you need space. I would kinda expect she would have learned the issue if it was an on going thing.\n\nMaybe try to teach her stuff she could do safely. Like \"you can be in here but you have to stay behind the caution line and help with X.\" If she can't follow the rules then she needs to wait until she's more responsible.", "NTA and honestly I'd start handing out some ultimatums. If she walks into the kitchen while you're cooking you turn everything off and leave the room. Or just stop cooking at altogether. She and your husband get cereal or peanut butter sandwiches for every single meal. Or announce that everyone is now responsible for their own meals and you will no longer be cooking for them as they don't respect you or care about your safety. You can't force her to tell you why she really wants to be in the kitchen and you can't force her to help or learn to cook if she truly doesn't want to, so if she refuses to stop this ridiculous behavior you'll stop it yourself. No more cooking until the walking safety hazard learns to keep out of the way.", "Nope NTA. That is unsafe as has been shown. Have your husband do all the cooking for a while and let him deal with her hovering behind him. Maybe he would change his tune. Standing there for no reason isn't okay. Maybe a chair in a corner so she can watch?", "NTA, after reading your comments she may indeed be bored, so you have two choices either assign her a household chore to do or stop cooking until she and takes the hint that her presence in the kitchen is dangerous and not welcomed during cooking time.", "NTA stop cooking", "Maybe you could try something like, you can be here when I cook but ONLY in this particular spot \u2014 obviously, out of the way.  That way, she could still be there, but both of you are safe.", "NTA\n\nI have an easy solution: your husband is going to be the family cook instead.\n\nBelieve me he will sine learn why you don't want behind you in the kitchen.", "NTA your husband is for not teaching his kid to respect people's CLEARLY ESTABLISHED boundaries.", "NTA stop cooking your husband can cook since he thinks he can handle it better", "NTA.  Put her to work. Anyone in the kitchen is to help you. Make it go for everyone. And then see if she wants to be there.", "NTA she should be allowed in the kitchen but not allowed to hang out right behind you.  Do you know why she wants to be in there?  Does she want to be near you, is she curious about the cooking, or is she trying to bother you?\n\nIf she wants to be in there for a good reason tell her you're afraid you will fall on her or spill something hot on her, give her a special stool or chair to sit on while you're cooking.  Try to give her small tasks if she's willing, like handing you the butter out of the refrigerator.  Maybe that will draw her into helping more.", "INFO: Did you explain to her that if she is scared of being burned, standing right behind you is the most dangerous place in a kitchen?\n\nSimply telling her to get out wasn't enough if you didn't explain exactly besides \"it's frustrating\"", "NTA. my only solution is to possibly face time her while you\u2019re cooking? that way she can watch but not be in the way ?", "NTA. Get a baby gate that has a latch she wouldn't be able to open and is high enough that she can't climb over it and use it to block the entrance to the kitchen when you are cooking.", "NTA. Although you can try handling it some other way. If love as well as yelling is not working, try welcoming her into the kitchen. Get a kids chair with a strap-on lock and make her watch you cook.", "It sounds like she really likes to be around you, have you tried setting her up in the kitchen in a designated spot? If I was a little kid and I wanted to be around a parent who I admired and they kept rejecting me I know it would sting. Now I understand the frustration as I have three kids myself and they're usually pretty oblivious when they're in the way, but I've never considered banning them from the kitchen. If they're in the way let em know, about to move a hot pot? Doesn't hurt to look at your surroundings and let em know you're about to move some boiling water and someone can get hurt. It can't be harder than a pet walking by, as you can communicate with your child way easier. Remember you're teaching them how to react when you react. Sit her down and have a conversation about both of you trying to be more mindful of your surroundings when in the kitchen, so everyone can be safe. Personal space is also a good discussion to have. It sounds like you're a much bigger influence in her life than you may realize. Sometimes standing behind someone and getting a negative reaction is better than getting no reaction from nobody. I could be wrong about all of this but in my experience kids do pretty silly stuff like this when they don't know how to properly communicate their feelings.\n\nI wouldn't say YTA, but it seems like there's possibly some reasons she's doing this you may want to investigate further. I'm not sure about the relationship with her mother but I can't imagine only seeing your mother once every other week leads to the most healthy development, and more than likely you're now filling that role. It's okay to get frustrated and feel like you have, and its even easier to overlook things like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Perhaps you should serve sandwiches and cereal for a week, and explain that you've decided to limit the dinner menu to what can safely be prepared. You're not going to continue to risk your's and daughter's safety since the family can't agree on following the kitchen rules. Until these rules can be followed, you have to think about everyone's well-being.\n\nAlso, I think you should sit down with step daughter, just the two of you, and have a conversation with her about why she wants to be so close to you all of a sudden. It seems like she may seeking attention from, or wanting quality time with you but doesn't know how to properly communicate that need. Her wanting to watch/do activities in your presence to me sounds like her primary interest is spending time with you. She also might secretly be interested in learning, which is why she insists on being present, but is still too scared/intimidated to vocalize her actual interest.

It was very weird and at the time none of us understood why she would do it. She eventually grew out of it about when she was 16, I think it's some kind of bonding thing or she was trying and just didn't understand how, her mom married my FIL and she came from a broken household. I don't know, but I understand where you are coming from and I think you are nta. Maybe try talking to her about the need to be so close.", "NTA\n\nHowever I think it's a good time to involve her mom if possible and ask what their kitchen time looks like. Does she do similar behaviors? Have there been discussions of how to be safe in the kitchen? I think if you haven't already it's also an appropriate time to talk about \"punishments\", or expectations for immediate response reactions (when something dangerous or potentially dangerous happens what're the expectations for you to react with?)\n\nI'd also take the time to check in with your partner when neither of you are upset, involve all the kids in the house and talk about kitchen safety, and how to respond to when fears come up.", "NTA but... I think she want to be close to you, want your company and love. A lot of kids go through similar phases. \n\nI understand that she is in your way and you need to keep both of you safe, but can you give her other little jobs she could do to help (e.g. setting up the table?). \n\nIn regards to the incident, I understand why you shouted at her, it could have been very bad. She was probably scared too. I think it is important that you talk to her once every thing is a bit more quiet. Apologies for screaming, explain that you still love her but you got hurt, and this is why it is important to follow the rules in the kitchen so that people don't get hurt... I would also have a chat with her about why she want to be in the kitchen with you. She might not know, but I suspect it is also in part due to her relationship with her mother and what is lacking from it. It could also that she want to learn by observing and is interested in cooking but is too scared about burning herself.\n\nMaybe offer to do some cooking together (make sure you set a specific day) to make something simple so that she can slowly work up the courage to do things that are a bit more challenging.

Is there anyway you could or would be willing to let her help with simple tasks like breaking up the lettuce for salad, buttering the rolls, or taking stems off the strawberries, etc, even maybe start out small with cutting soft things with a butter knife and work her way up from prep to cooking slowly to help build her confidence? \n\nIt\u2019s a good skill for the kids to learn and it\u2019s not to early to start teaching them.", "NTA.

She gets to be in the kitchen and gets some beginning friendly, no-burn-risk tasks she can do if she wants to practice. \n3. She stays out of the kitchen if she doesn\u2019t want to do either of those things specifically because it\u2019s a safety risk.", "+1", "Lmao lurking like a post it note on your butt. Love all of this!", "Oh I love this response. Seriously OP, next time it happens turn all the burners off. NTA\n\nEdit to add: maybe put a bell on the door for now, to avoid another surprise, since they seem to refuse to understand.", " I say, \"Why is there a dog in my kitchen??\" and she immediately walks out and sits in the doorway to watch.", "She shrugs her shoulders and says \"I dunno, I'm bored\".", "I wanna know this too OP. I also wanna know if this is a recent thing?", "This.  I'm surprised I had to scroll this far to find it.  A rule has been established.  Kids is repeatedly ignoring said rule.  Kid is lucky all that's happened is they've gotten yelled at *once*.  My daughter just turned 10, son is 11.  Our kitchen is also tiny, with one way in and out.   The first thing you pass is the fridge.  So the rule is, When the stove is on, do not pass the fridge, do not collect $200 (monopoly joke).  Occasionally one of the kids won't realize my wife is cooking and will try to come in.  All we have to say is the stove is on.  The instantly get that means back up and stay out.  If they want to talk from a diatance that's fine.  Sounds like OP has a discipline issue that dear old daddy is creating.  NTA", "The kitchen is literally so small. It's like a hallway space. So the fridge is on the far wall and then there's only one counter between the fridge and the stove and one counter space after the stove. I only have roughly 10 inches behind me when I'm standing at the stove. There's no where for her to stand without being in my way.", "We do a lot of one on one together. We do ballet twice a week, she has horse back riding lessons every summer, that I intend with her and we do dinner dates just the two of us once a week (my husband and I rotate so all the kids get that one on one dinner once a week with both of us). We also sit and color and have board game and movie nights. Her and I also do our hair and make up together and have girl time.", "I thought that also but when I saw her husband's reaction, I thought maybe this would be a bad thing because it could be a temporary situation.  Who would stay married to that jerk?  I've seen boiling water burns and they are nasty. It happened to my mother, and no I was not standing right behind her but I was in the room.  \nHe should have been putting cold wet towels on her and offering to take her to the emergency room  \nOP you are NTA.", "Option 3: Before starting, walk her over to her father and tell them it\u2019s  now their super-fun togetherness time!", "I mean, spill something that's not hot, she's still a kid. But in quantity. Like a whole pot of room temp vegetable oil.", "This cannot be upvoted enough!  Perfect way to handle this.", "My dog tries this too. After 10 years she does not sit, she will not give you her paw, she only comes when I call her if we're outside and I'm going in because she's afraid of being outside alone, but if she is bothering me in the kitchen, I say, \"Why is there a dog in my kitchen??\" and she immediately walks out and sits in the doorway to watch.   \nOP maybe you should try \"Why is there a dog in my kitchen?\". You never know.", "OP has said repeatedly in the comments that her stepdaughter has expressed no interest in learning or being involved in the cooking, even when asked several times and when OP has offered to involve her in cooking activities that have no burn risk. Not only has she said she isn't interested in learning, but she has also outright refused to help when asked.", "She\u2019s 10 years old, not 10 months old\u2026", "There is no room in her kitchen. Op stated it's like a hallway style kitchen and there's barely even room for her husband to pass behind her. It's safer for the kids to just stay out of the kitchen and you would have yelled too if you got boiling pasta water on you too it's a reasonable response to me. NTA", "OP has already said repeatedly in the comments that she has asked her stepdaughter if she would like to learn/help with the cooking, and even offered to cook cold/no burn-risk foods with her to avoid the fear of getting burned, and stepdaughter has refused and said she has no interest in learning or helping. OP has also said the kitchen is so small that there isn't even a place where her stepdaughter could sit safely and watch. As such, she has no reason to be in the kitchen.", "There's no where for her to sit in the kitchen. It's an old apartment kitchen that is literally just a walk way wide enough for one person. My husband can't even walk behind me when I'm cooking. I've asked her if she wants to make no-burn risk foods and she still says no. She won't help at all with salads even. She simply doesn't want to. Curiosity or not she shouldn't be standing on my heals and causing severe burns on me.", "I learned not to say that to my mother. She had all kinds of things for me to do when I was 'bored'. Maybe she needs some tasks to perform.\n\nStill, her being right on your heels is kind of creepy, no? Dangerous to be sure, but silently coming up on you like that-I'd be a little freaked out.", "She'll be a lot less bored when you put her to work.  It doesn't matter that she didn't want to help -- if she's going to be in the kitchen, then she's going to help.\n\nYou'll either get help or get peace.  Either way you win.", "Time to start giving her tasks to do while she's \"bored\". Garuntee you it will keep her out of the kitchen while your cooking.", "You realize that this is code for \"I need some housecleaning tasks to perform\", right?  \nAt least that's what I learned by say this to my mom/dad/grandpa/grandma  :)", "Ok....YTA....any reasonable adult would know that isn't the real reason and that there is a real reason behind it.  Instead of sitting her down talking to her you just say \"get out\".  Instead of saying hey if you want to stay in here you have to sit here you say \"get out\". \n\nYou didn't handle it as if she was your child,  you handled it as if she was an inconvenience", "It's started like 6 months ago and whenever I ask why she insists on being in the kitchen for every single meal I cook if she doesn't want to help or learn, she just shrugs her shoulders and says she is bored.", "OK then.  I'd have no problem kicking my 10 year old out of the kitchen in that situation.", "I'd agree with another commenter. The minute she gets behind you at the stove, shut everything off and stop cooking. Cereal for dinner. Every time. If your husband isn't going to parent her on this then he gets Corn Flakes.", "Yes, but she seems to not be able to follow instructions after repeated reminders and is putting herself and others in as much danger as a toddler would, so perhaps she needs this type of solution.", "I don\u2019t disagree with you about the last part. But clearly she wants to be there and banning her isn\u2019t working, and screaming at her when you get hurt accidentally isn\u2019t working either. That\u2019s why I said ESH. So you and your husband need to talk to each other and then talk to her rather than continuing to do two things that are not working as nauseous expecting it to be different.", "Yeah being bored was a sin worse than murder when I was  kid.", "\"You're bored? Let me find something for you to do\" \\*Gives me a 5 page-long chore list\\*", "I did handle it the same way I would have with my own biological children, actually. Her and I have girl talk all the time. Kids are bored all the time so it's a very real possibility that that's exactly what happening. Not every child is riddled with dark secrets that they aren't letting out. That sounds like projection at best.", "I agree with you. It seems the daughter wants some mom time- a hug and a kiss and a how you doin'? I also say to OP YTA.", "NTA. What if she has the choice of helping or leaving? Maybe give her an easy task, like shredding lettuce. If this doesn\u2019t work, as another poster suggested, stop cooking. If your SO doesn\u2019t like it, he can pick up where you left off. You and the child have both gotten hurt, so her being in the kitchen isn\u2019t working. \n\nI have to tell you, this seems odd to me. Like those creepy twins in The Shining, just standing there. I wonder why she\u2019s doing that?", "It seems so odd to me. I know reddit has a habit of jumping to conclusions but it sounds like she either really wants to talk to you or she's seeking your protection. \n\nI'm gonna say nta but I would sit down and really talk to her about what's going on. If she's risking your anger to stay in there, there must be a reason", "INFO: have you ever snuck anything in her food or lied to her about what you\u2019re feeding her? I\u2019m just trying to think of a reason she\u2019d want to observe you cooking so closely and that\u2019s a common thing that parents do to kids \u201cfor their own good\u201d.", "Is that how you\u2019re asking her? Because if so, woof.", "Except then the OP doesn't get the good dinner she was looking forward to.", "We used to love telling my dad we were bored growing up. He would event all kinds of games for us to play.", "We used to love telling my dad we were bored growing up. He would event all kinds of games for us to play.", "When she says \"I'm bored\" next time, can't you hand her a cutting board, a knife, and a carrot and tell her to chop it up? It sounds to me like she DOES want to learn but doesn't even know where to start -- if you're good cook, you probably move pretty fast and it looks intimidating. Giving her prep tasks will slow you down at first, but she'll learn pretty quick that if you're in the kitchen during meal prep, you better have a tool in your hand.", "So for 6 months this child has been told by you to stay out the kitchen, you yelled at her to do so. She watched you injure yourself because she continue to enter the kitchen. \n\nAfter repeatedly being told and seeing the consequences she still does it. And you still believe it's simply because she's bored. There's no projection here, but I think you're being willfully ignorant to think this just kids being kids. \n\nOnce or twice maybe. But for a solid 6 months it's more than \"I'm bored\".", "She's been doing it for 6 months. She's not bored. Just start giving her jobs to do while your cooking and talking through what you're doing. You might be surprised to discover something here.", "Lol wow didn't know that many people disagree with the idea of talking to a child and seeing why they repeatedly do an action you warn them not to do.  Guess saying \"I'm bored\" for 6 months is acceptable to some parents", "That's a good point. Maybe there's problem with a sibling that recently started? It is pretty odd behavior, it seems like something should have triggered it", "Point taken but this is getting dangerous for both of them.", "This is the right answer. Most parents bury *bored* children in chores when I'll they wanted was to spend time with them.", "Yup! If my children come to me and say they are bored - they get to pick a chore to do OR find something else to do instead.  But if they come to me and hover because \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d then it\u2019s great! I need someone to do dishes/laundry/insert chore here and then you\u2019ll have something to do!!", "If you didn't read my post just say that. Literally said that I've asked her to help and tried teaching her and she outright refuses. She simply stands on my heels. And yes, she is bored. I've known her for 8 years and I know the signs.", "It's alright, I often have the wrong opinion on here lol. But all I read was how the girl wanted some attention from \"Mom\" but at 10 it's hard to know the words to say especially if that person is telling you to move and get away.", "If you don't want people's input, don't post your dilemma on Reddit and refuse to accept what anyone else says.", "Telling them to try something they already did isn't really useful input lol"]}
