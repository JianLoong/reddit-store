I've made enough money since I was 21 that she has never had to work, and we don't have kids yet. She used a lot of that time to get a bachelors degree. I asked her to try working for a bit when she was 24 and wow big regrets. Homemaking even without kids is something I learned to appreciate so much. I just didn't see what it really meant until she wasn't doing it. I asked her to stop working pretty quickly. Now she just works at our local ski resort for fun a few hours and home makes otherwise.\n\nI'm one of those people that is really good at something specific, so I make quite good money. But I'm a mess otherwise. She's good at everything else that I'm not. She makes me healthy homemade food and bring love into every moment of my day, which makes me perform better at work. Her homemaking unironically makes us more money as a household than if we both worked white collar jobs because my income increases year over year much faster when I can focus. That's why she spends OUR money whenever she sees fit. She earned it just as much as I did by helping me achieve more professionally.\n\nBasically, I'm posting this because there are good men that don't currently understand why homemaking is important but will learn. And it isn't something that you can itemize, which most jobs you can't. Don't try to because it just isn't going to make sense. They either understand the value, or they don't. You aren't a salesperson, nor do you need to be about it. Your boyfriend may not ever learn that.\n\nLastly, don't let your boyfriend make you feel like homemaking does not have value. It has THE MOST value of any job in this world. Our consumerism shit-tier society has made us lose sight of the intangible things that make us happy and at the center of any happy household is a wonderful homemaker.
