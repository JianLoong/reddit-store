For the religions of the Christian area, baptism is only the first step, then other sacraments follow.\n\n\r  \nObviously, since you said you gave in on baptism, your in-laws will now feel empowered to press for the other sacraments as well. The lie you told can't last long.\n\n\r  \nYou should have been honest and said, \"I don't believe in baptism and in your religion, and I want to give my child freedom of choice: when they're older, they will decide for themselves about religion.\"", "NTA\n\nI guess\u2026 but pretending to give in now will only come back to bite you in the ass when it\u2019s time for the first communion or confirmation. Good luck with that.", "NTA I was baptized as a baby just to shut people up. It was the only interaction with the church I ever had. I see no real difference here. You're just keeping the religious wackjobs off your back.", "Yes. Don\u2019t lie. Either get the baby baptized or explain to them it won\u2019t be baptized. Preferably get it baptized as religion is a very important and useful tool in establishing morality and culture.", "ESH.\n\nYou least of all - the lie is eventually going to be found out, and you'll have to admit to it. But your husband's family need to get their nose out of your business, and your husband needs to deal with his family directly and stop putting it off/leaving you in that awkward position. If he can't deal with that conversation, then he needs to get off your case and let you just do it for the sake of you and your child.", "How do you plan to keep up this lie? I mean will you lie he made his First Communion when he's older and continue it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So soft YTA", "Just tell\nthem the truth", "it\u2019s none of the in-laws business if you comply to their religion, but not talking to your husband before hand about this makes ESH", "YTA. Your husband was attempting to avoid the question and keep the peace. If you were unhappy with that then you should have spoken to him first about finding a joint approach. You are both in this together, that\u2019s how a relationship works. Together you could have made a decision as a United front instead of forcing him to choose between upholding your lie or compromising his moral character.", "NTA. I'm all for shutting people the fuck up however you need to.", "Soft ESH.  It's your baby, if you don't want to baptize them, say you're not going to do it and they can learn to live with it.  And your husband needs to support that if he is also okay not having the baby baptized, and grow up and talk to his parents like an adult.  Lying is just going to make things worse when they find out (not that it is their business anyway though).", "ESH\n\nThis will come to a head. NTA for not baptizing the baby but this is a band-aid you want to rip off now before the other steps (and there *are* other steps) come up. And I don't just mean Catholic. Let's say they're visiting and it's time to go to your IL's  Super Cool Non Denominational Why-Would-You-Ever-Think-That-About-Us? Church.\n\n\"Well he's baptized isn't he/she?\"", "NTA.\n\nIf your husband didn't want to lie, why didn't he tell the truth?\n\nAlso, I think total honesty is overrated. That lie you told doesn't hurt anyone, in fact considering the reason why religious people are so avid about baptism (something about unbaptized babies going to purgatory or some such nonsense), then your lie was actually a kindness to them.\n\nI suppose one could make the argument that you hurt your husband by lying, since now he feels he has to lie too. But then, he should have put on his big boy pants and told his parents to knock it off.", "NTA. My mom\u2019s side of the family is Catholic and while my mom doesn\u2019t care if her grandchildren are baptized or not, some of my mom\u2019s siblings think it\u2019s a big deal if my cousins don\u2019t baptize their kids and it leads to lots of drama. Your lie may catch up to you one day but in the meantime, it\u2019s a white lie to keep the peace.", "YTA.  Let your husband handle his relatives, and stay out of it.", "YTA - that lie is going to become a big problem. You've said that you made your baby a Christian, officially. It doesn't stop there.\n\nTell them the truth. Stand up for your principles.", "NTA. Are you sure the baby is his? Bc that man's got no balls", "NTA. No one would have to lie if your husband just told them to shut their traps about your kid.", "Yta because now yoyvr forced him into a lie. Have him be the sole respondent on religious rituals", "INFO: why didn\u2019t your husband tell them the truth if he cares so much?", "I don't think so, it's your prerogative to raise your child as you wish. While lying is dishonest, sometimes it's better to not shake up the family like that. If you had told them the truth, they may have never forgiven you and that would be infinitely worse than a small lie that doesn't harm anyone.", "YTA - don\u2019t start this kid\u2019s life off having to lie. It\u2019s very hard to stand up to family, especially when religion is involved - boy do I know it! But the sooner you rip off that bandaid and make it clear where you stand (in a tactful way, not in a way that attacks your beliefs) the better.\n\nWith your approach, you\u2019re now going to have to rescind a lie and try to rebuild trust, which sucks for you, your husband, and your kid!", "Your baby to raise as you like. It's none of their business. I would tell them the truth and tell them to stop bugging you about it.", "Why not follow your husband's lead? Yes, his parents are butting in and it sounds annoying, but if you didn't like the way he was handling it (by being vague), you should have talked to him, not go over his head.\n\nYes, I recognise that the husband's strategy seems poor, but 1.- he may actually know better, and 2.- it sounds like his business.\n\nESH.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't have told his parents anything without his input, especially lies. Is it really that hard to handle their criticisms from \"far away\"? \n\nYou decided to take executive control because you didn't like the way he was handling it with his own parents. That's not a good sign for your relationship or your parenting choices going forward. You need to be a team.\n\nAnd you decided alone that the team aspect wasn't important here.\n\nApologize.", "Nta tell your husband he is more than welcome to tell them you lied, however when they call you to approach the subject that your answer this time will be less than diplomatic.\n\nTell him that you will tell them to take their suggestion, harassment\u2019s  and options and take a flying leap. It\u2019s your baby. You will raise him like you want their option is not needed but more importantly not wanted. \n\nTell him you\u2019re done. Until he grows a pair of balls and learns how to deal with his parents you no longer will. That from this moment on you will not answer phone calls, FaceTimes, and text.\n\nYour done. He can placate them how he wants, however you will no longer tolerate the harassment.", "never mind, if they\u2019re religious they\u2019re already used to be lied to.", "Yes, YTA, you should have set clear boundaries up front \u2013 what happens when in-laws want to go to your kid's first communion? Confirmation? Are you just going to keep lying?", "NTA. It has nothing to do with them. Your husband has no right to be upset with you since he vacillated so long, you had to stop the bickering. It will never matter. Tell him to dry his eyes.", "NTA. Your husband should have dealed with them and help you out.", "YTA. People\u2019s faiths mean a lot to them, just as your lack of faith does to you. Just be honest.", "NTA.  This is less of a lie than the \"babtism\" itself is.  Your husband should be standing up for both of you.", "NTA, your husband is spineless and should have answered his family, and tell them to quit it. \n\nMy preferred way to deal with this would be to ghost the family. Don\u2019t answer the phone when his family calls; they can call him. You\u2019re to bussy with the baby and you\u2019re not available. \n\nSince they kept pestering you, lying is just a coping mechanism to get their bullying to quit. \n\nYour husband brought this upon himself. He has no reason to be angry with you, he himself dropped the ball leaving you to solve his family problem the way you see fit.", "I'm going to go against the trend here and say NTA, because your husband hemmed and hawed and left you to deal with the brunt of their repeated nagging.  He was the one who wasn't honest in the first place, and they're his parents.  He put you in a really unpleasant and annoying position.    \n\n\nIn future any time they bug you about something just parrot over and over, \"you'll have to talk to \\[husband\\] about that.\"", "In normal circumstances, based on your own circle of living and regardless of outside human life outside your own, specifically designated circle.\n\n90% of the times your absolutely unique opinion absolutely has no value.", "In normal circumstances, based on your own circle of living and regardless of outside human life outside your own, specifically designated circle.\n\n90% of the times your absolutely unique opinion absolutely has no value.", "It's not her prerogative to lie to his family without his involvement!
