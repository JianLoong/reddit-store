It would probably damage your relationship, but this dog is sadly not compatible with a normal life, and these things do happen. It's nobody's fault, certainly not yours for reporting it and not your parents for feeling bad for the dog.

You can choose to not socialize with your bf's family or go near the dog. \n\nAre you hoping to convince them to re-home the dog by unloading him on unsuspecting strangers ?  That's an AH move. \n\nYou could also call animal control, show pictures of your bf's injuries, and report the multiple other bites of human victims.

That may sound cruel, but you'd be protecting the dog's future victims because with these owners, there WILL be more victims. \n\nWhat's your goal here ?", "Info: how old is everyone?", "shes literally setting that dog up for death. it needs to be rehomed now. the dog WILL attack and kill someone and will be killed itself bc of so.", "Well is there anyway you can compromise with them and get the dog into training or at least muzzle it outside the home?

Not ALL dogs belong in family homes. As someone who has been in a very similar situation and was one of the victims of the dog, I\u2019m glad that someone eventually reported that dog. I mean, who knows who that dog would attack on the runs bf\u2019s mom wants to take him on!!! If they don\u2019t want someone, another one of their pets, or someone else\u2019s pet to be seriously injured or killed, they need to get rid of this dog. And FAST! They are basically asking for a lawsuit by keeping it and letting it get away with biting like that\u2026\nOnce the attacking starts, it won\u2019t stop. It will just continue to get worse. Believe me! And, unfortunately, the owners usually don\u2019t see that until it\u2019s too late\u2026\nIf reporting the dog yourself is the only way to make that home a safe one again, then I\u2019d say do it without hesitation. Those who have already fallen victim to that dog and the ones who could have been will later thank you.", "This is beyond rehoming or training.

The dog has attacked everyone and caused severe damage. A dog doesn't care and with so much trauma and age this dog has a 99% chance of staying the same. The dog doesn't want to compromise clearly since it has bit everyone. \n\nPut your soft brain aside and think. Do you want to have to muzzle your dog 24/7 because it might try to kill you? Trainers might not accept this dog because of its age and aggression. Training is for the dogs FIRST owner and when it is younger.", "It's a kelpie", "That's why I said they need to call Animal control, some dogs need professional help but if this dog has continued to bite and then attacked someone they need to be put down before someone else or those other animals get seriously hurt, or worse.", "I completely understand what you are saying. Just putting it out there because if reported this dog probably will be put to death. And yes if nothing changes than maybe that is for the best however there are plenty of examples of successful rehabilitation but the owners do need to be 100% committed to it. (Also just a clarification I meant comprising with the parents, not with the dog haha. Obviously a dog doesn\u2019t understand the concept of comprise).", "Thats really out of character for a Kelpie. Poor thing probably went through something horrific to turn like that. NTA about reporting it. The dog needs some serious action to change behaviour or to be unfortunately put down.", "Yes, I also know a dog can't compromise but I mean he probably wont listen if he hasn't already.  The dog should probably be put down if it continues, since it has severe trauma and is neurotic. I believe dogs should have a chance but this one has and not saying its his fault but he failed. It isnt fair but you should put your life at danger for a crazy and unstable dog that wants to attack. If they arent committed to truly caring for that dog ( not compromising, letting it attack, keeping it a secret)  rehabilitation is sadly out of the question.", "There are plenty of examples of permanent life altering injuries as well."]}
