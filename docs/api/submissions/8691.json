Your husband likely thought he was doing something nice by giving you the opportunity to really focus on yourself and your relaxation rather than him and his comfort (is he even someone who likes going to a spa?)\n\nBut on the flip side, you're not an AH for wanting some company at the spa.", "NAH - hubby wanted to get you a relaxing solo day, but may not have known you'd prefer to have company. Good intentions sometimes lead to less than desirable results.", "NAH your husband has good intentions and probably thought you\u2019d react better as a spa day sounds like an ideal gift but your completely justified questioning it especially if you just wanted to spend more time with him", "NAH.", "NAH.  However, if you communicate clearly how you feel to your husband and he gets defensive and angry instead of being understanding and appreciating your open communication of how you feels, he's the AH.", "NAH\n\nI've had times when I just want to have a massage by myself and chill out - and I've also had times when my husband has joined me and we've had a very calm, romantic day of it.  \n\nYour husband thought he was giving a nice gift of a day of relaxation - and likely didn't stop to think that you might not want to be entirely alone (or maybe just didn't even know what the spa day fully entailed, including long stretches of time entirely alone)", "NAH\n\n\"and I want to know if what I did was bad?\"\n\nI think you're overthinking it and that it shows too much. Your husband is with you for film and a dinner. It sounds like that might be too common?", "NAH- You aren\u2019t TA neither is your husband.\n\n(TY for the correction)", "Nah", "NAH. It makes perfect sense that your husband would gift you some alone time at a spa. It also makes sense that you may want some company. He is spending time with you later in the evening so it doesn\u2019t sound like mal intent. Is there an option to add a \u201cday pass\u201d on for the pools so your husband or a family member can join when you won\u2019t be in treatment?", "NAH - but give the solo day a chance, you may come to love it.", "My dad brought me a spa day once for something (can\u2019t remember why) and I wasn\u2019t sure about going alone but it was actually really nice. Lots of people are on their own and no one really cares. I even had lunch on my own. \n\nIf my husband were buying me the spa day, I\u2019d prefer him to come so we can spend quality time together. But if it\u2019s not his thing and it is yours, I understand why he thinks you\u2019d enjoy it on your own.\n\nNAH as he\u2019s trying to do a nice thing and you would rather go with someone.

My husband is not the best of picking out gifts so now I usually go shopping with him and pick out something for myself. My best girlfriend and I exchange surprise presents because we\u2019re better at it. This way, no surprises and no hurt feelings. \ud83d\ude42", "NTA, he clearly doesn't respect your feelings. I'd divorce and go NC. This is a slippery slope towards physical abuse.", "INFO: you haven't said what your reaction actually was? What did you say to him when you say 'what I did was bad'? \n\nIf you explained how you feel like your post does then definitely NTA and NAH, as your feelings are completely understandable whilst your husband was probably just trying to do something nice for you and hadn't fully considered the implications.", "Hun, i think he wants you to make friends. it\u2019s not healthy that he\u2019s the only person in your life", "Yep, think is definitely a different strokes situation. Personally, I would be thrilled to have a whole day to myself. I do wonder why her husband doesn't know her well enough to know she would prefer company, though. Maybe she's never expressed that.", ">Maybe just different strokes for different folks\n\nYeah.  As an introvert I say sign me up for an afternoon by myself.  I get that for others it would be torture though.", "That judgement would be NAH", "That's NAH", "NAH\n\nThis is a thoughtful gift, but it might not be thoughtful for you. If you are someone who would obviously not want alone time as a birthday celebration then your husband should have chosen something else.\n\nPersonally this sounds like a reflect day to me, alone time to relax in the am and celebrating with loved ones in the pm.\n\nCommunication of your desires ahead of time would have helped here on both sides", "NAH\n\nBut maybe its an opportunity to try and make friends\n\nBeing in that positions makes you sound very needy.", "NAH if he never booked one before so doesn\u2019t really know how they work. (Possibly his mum and sister are AH if they have been to a spa before!)\n\nSome places will let someone join you just for the afternoon tea part. That might be worth investigating. Much cheaper than paying for a full spa day for him.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m a solitary spa girl myself so I can\u2019t relate to you wanting company, but something that stands out to me is three people chipped in for this gift for you, so I think it\u2019s probably quite a pricey experience, hence why you\u2019re solo. I am sure if it had been feasible he/they would have loved to send a friend or come along themselves.", "I could also simply be a matter of cost. It took 3 people to go in on this gift for OP, and the husband still has dinner and a movie to pay for afterward. He could simply not have been able to afford a second spa package.", "Apreciating your open communication of how you feels, he's the AH.", "They are also expensive, and since there\u2019s 3 people pitching in to the gift they may not be able to afford it for two.", "WTF is this comment for freaking spa day what if he couldn't afford 2 person spa day Jesus I feel bad for anyone in a relationship with you. NAH but you sure are the AH.", "Let's recap:  It took 3 people pitching in to afford a ***half*** day at a spa.  Not even a full day, a half a day.  Did it ever occur to you that a half day for one person was all he (with help!) could afford?  \n\nAnd instead of appreciating it, you tell him the gift wasn't good enough?  Soft YTA.  You should be able to do what you want on your birthday, but you could have declined the gift graciously.  It sounds like you didn't.", "YTA.  He got a gift for *you*, not for you and a friend.\n\nYou're more than welcome to invite somebody along, but your husband shouldn't have to pay that freight.", "> he's taken my reaction badly and I want to know if what I did was bad\n\nINFO what reaction?", "A little YTA\n\nThe gift was incredibly thoughtful. What you could have said to him was \"This is such a nice gift! I think I might enjoy it even more if you came with me!\" Right now, it sounds like you don't appreciate it. Your reasons are valid, not wanting to do it by yourself, but you have probably ensured that this thoughtfulness will not happen again!", "NAH I would personally love to have lunch by myself in a spa like setting, and then meet up with someone after. Might not be your thing and that\u2019s ok, but totally reasonable for him to think you\u2019d enjoy it.", "NAH but I completely understand your discomfort because I was in the same position. Husband treated me to a spa day on my own (pressie from him and the kids), I smiled like crazy and kept thanking them because I knew they'd spent money on me and didn't want to upset them. I put it off until the day before it expired and had to book it. I've got various issues, including my weight, not being seen without clothes on, being touched etc., so the whole day was an utter nightmare! Eating lunch on my own while feeling like I was being watched, taking my clothes off for a massage and being touched, being in a swimming costume  - everything! If I'd had my partner or friend there I'd have been fine, in fact many parts probably have been fun! As it was I was just desperately trying not to cry when I got home and I can say with certainty I will never have a pedicure, massage or anything similar again! \n\nSo you don't hurt his feelings (assuming you have the money) could you suggest paying for him to go with you as a Valentine's present from you to him and explain that you think you'd have so much fun together and he deserves a treat too?", "I tend to agree but surely her husband should know which type she is?", "It seems like the sort of thing he should've asked about before buying, if it's that expensive and especially since he was going to tell her what the gift was before the birthday anyway.", "Was thinking that - it doesn't usually quit double the price but still a substantial add on and he might not want a massage or to spend time waiting for her. Also not all spas have unisex saunas or steamrooms which are usually part of the deal. \n\nNAH for wanting company but think just taking a cheap copy of a good book and chilling will respect the family's gift. I do get wanting company at afternoon tea though.", "People aren't always a consistent 'type.'"]}
