Tricky one.\nIt has been out of your possession for so long that mum may have felt justified in giving it to someone else in need. That said, she should have spoken with you first.\nIs the cost of her hiring one for you instead of replacing it a compromise you are willing to accept?", "NAH--so far.\n\nOP, have you and your mother gotten in your car and driven to her friends house?  Try that first to get your tent back.  Your mother didn't give it to a friend, she lent it to a friend.  That is a little AH-ish since it wasn't hers but still.", "I suspect this too. If a friend was using it I would assume it was for a party or event that she was invited to, why wouldn\u2019t she have just taken it back at the end of the event? I have no issues if somebody wanted to borrow it but it was an expensive tent and everybody knows I love to entertain and would continue to use it over and over.", "I have no way to confirm that this isn\u2019t what happened. If the friend does indeed exist I also have no way of knowing what the context was they were given the tent, whether it was truly supposed to be they were borrowing it or whether they were gifted it.", "Yeah my mom gave some of my shit away that she said I could store in the garage. \n\nI was pissed for sure, but at the same time it wasn't a hill I was going to die on because she has and will help me in times of need.", "It was about a $1400 tent. And she knew at the time we made the agreement that she would be storing it for a couple years, as I had nowhere to store it until I had moved into a new house. She was the one who had proposed the agreement, I was going to turn around and resell it on marketplace after my event to get the money back. She benefited by using it for herself numerous times over those 2 years. Large party tents are about $1000 to rent in the area. If at any time she no longer wanted to store it she knew that I could resell it, which was my initial plan.", "She agreed to store it. She didn\u2019t have permission to give it away.", "It\u2019s a $1400 tent, it would cost about $1000 to rent. She knew at the time the arrangement was made that she would be hanging out to it for a couple of years until I bought a house with more storage. She actually proposed hanging on to it as she wanted to use it for herself and she had done so a handful of times.", "How is it NAH when the mom gave it to someone else without permission and didn\u2019t get it back?  That\u2019s AH behavior\u2026", "I have not, she hasn\u2019t told me who the friend is but I doubt it\u2019s somebody I know.", "She needs to either try harder to find her friend and get it back or reimburse you the cost.  This is her fault 100%.  Nta", "I would at least push for an honest answer about where it ended up and why said person is unreachable. \nYou think it is BS, many here have a similar opinion. At least knowing the full story may allow you to understand what has happened.\n\n1400 is a lot of money to some, not to others. I don't know where any of the parties fall in this, but is it enough to risk harming relationships with loved ones?", "INFO: How many times in the last two years have you picked up/checked up on the tent? \n\nIs this the first time you're mentioning it to her again, is basically what I'm looking for. A $1400 party tent doesn't just fit in a drawer or go in a closet, I'm trying to feel out the logistics of this tent lmao", "NTA. She had no right to loan something that was not hers. She absolutely needs to replace it", "Sounds more like she somehow broke the tent when she last used it, and is afraid of confessing this. \n\nYWNBTA. Ask her to either \"magic\" the tent back, give you a \"new\" (comparable wear & tear) tent, or give you enough money to buy yourself a replacement.", "NTA - your mother either returns your tent in the condition it was when it went into storage or replaced it with the same or similar (even if it costs her more than you paid for it).", "YWNBTA\n\n\n\nImo if you lose/break something that belongs to someone else, you should at least be willing to replace it, without the owner having to ask you to, to begin with.\n\n\nAlso, lending something that doesn't belong to you to someone else and without the owner's permission, is a very bad idea..", "NTA your mother failed to keep the property safe. it's on her to replace it", "She had it stored in an unused barn on her property. She has been using the tent for her own events since the last time I\u2019ve used it for my own party. I\u2019ve been to her own parties where she\u2019s used it probably 4x over the last 2 years? Each time she\u2019s used it I\u2019ve helped set it up and broken it down. I did not have any parties or events of my own last summer as my house was on the market at that time.", "I\u2019ve always helped her set up and break down every time she\u2019s used it. I know it wasn\u2019t broken the last time she\u2019s used it for herself. It also is super durable and I imagine would be pretty difficult to break.", "You're mother wanted to be a nice guy and generous on your dime. NTA", "Do you think there's any possibility she considers it a \"left it with me for so long it's mine\" kinda situation?\n\nI don't think you'll be an AH to ask her to help replace it, but it feels more like a 50/50 situation is the best bet. She's been storing it for you for a long time, using it, etc. I don't think saying \"you owe me 1400 bucks\" is fair in this case. \n\nBut I'm just a dude on the internet", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any possibility of that. Going in she knew that she would have it for at least a couple of years as I was looking to purchase a larger home with more storage. My previous property had nowhere to store it. She was the one that offered to store it for me as she was getting the benefit of using it for her own events. It\u2019s only one summer (last summer) that I didn\u2019t use it and the reason was because my house was on the market at the time.", "I don\u2019t think $1400 is an insane amount to anybody involved. It\u2019s just pretty bothersome to me that she knows I love to entertain (it\u2019s a huge part of the reason I bought this new house), and knew I would get a ton of use out of this tent and still either gave it away/sold/lost it. It\u2019s just a bummer, if the roles were reversed I would have replaced it without having to be asked. If at any point something changed and she no longer wanted to store it she could have just told me and I either would have sold it or made other arrangements for storage.", "Not enoungh info here. You have to get your mom to tell you what the story is with the tent. I guess if she won't do that, than NTA and she should replace it.", "NTA.\n\nShe offered to store it for you in an out-of-the-way place on her property, because she could use it herself. She knew you would be claiming it in two years or so.\n\nAll this you have told us.\n\nNow comes the mystery. Maybe she lent it to someone. Maybe she sold it. Either way, she made use of property that she agreed to hold for you and is basically saying, Too bad, so sad.\n\nWhy not tell her that you'll go permanent NC on her and see what she does? She can get it back from whoever or buy you another one.\n\nSome may call it harsh, but you won't see movement on her side unless she needs to avoid a rift in her family. And what she did is the equivalent of theft.", "NTA, given the additional info that yoou have provided.  Since it was a $1400 tent, I'd ask my mother for the friend's details and track them down.  Can't be that hard these days.", "NTA either mom gets your tent back or she pays you back the money or she buys you a new tent", "OP said the tent cost $1400. That's enough money to make a mess of things over", "I guess she lent it to a friend she used to work with and now is unable to contact that person", "She is being pretty vague about where it ended up but I guess the story is that she loaned it to a work friend that she no longer works with and now can\u2019t contact. I don\u2019t think am losing a tent is severe enough to go no contact over but I do wish that she would offer something towards a replacement. That\u2019s what I would do if the roles were reversed.", "Sorry. 2 years. The statute of limitations on \"holding this for you\" has passed.", "You don't know that dude. Different amounts mean different things to different people in different contexts.\n I've already said he's technically fine :P", "She knew going in that she would be holding it for a while and was the one that offered to hold it it exchange for using it for her own events. If for whatever reason she no longer wanted to store it she could have just told me and I would have either sold it or made other arrangements for it. I initially planned to sell it right after my party until she said she wanted to store it for me in exchange for being able to use it for her own events. Her being able to use it last summer for her own parties saved her thousands in tent rental fees so it\u2019s not like she was just doing me a favor without getting something out of it.", "I disagree. If someone offers to store something for you, they don't get to decide to give it away after a small number of years have passed. Especially if it's a large, expensive or sentimental item that someone with a permanent home has offered to keep for you. (So not a sweater your drunk third cousin forgot at your apartment 2 years ago, but an actual storage agreement for a valuable item.) The mom should have been sure to get the tent back when she loaned it someone and/or asked OP's permission if she intended to give it away permanently.", "? Based on what exactly?", "It wasn\u2019t just an offer to store it as a favor to me, she was benefiting herself from storing it as she used it numerous times for her own parties. It was only one summer (last summer) that I didn\u2019t use it, and the reason I didn\u2019t have an event last summer was because my house was on the market and I was moving into my new house.", "Or, just ask for the friends name, address and phone number", "NTA\n\nYour mother explanation is fishy.\nAsk for replacement and don't invite her at garden party until it is done.", "Could also have sold it, but wants to keep the proceeds.", "Since this is a high ticket item (I was seriously thinking about $100- boy, was I  wrong!) then try to find these people! I don't mean to be ageist, but you might be more savvy than she in finding someone. Hopefully they haven't moved far away.", "How about you contact this friend?", "The only information I have is a first name. The story is that my mom used to work with this woman, the only contact she had with her was through work, she didn\u2019t get the tent back immediately after the woman\u2019s event and her and the woman no longer work together. I don\u2019t have a last name or anything to go by. It\u2019s bizarre to me that she was friendly enough with this woman to loan the expensive tent out, but not friendly enough to even know her last name or to have any contact info.", "That or mom ruined it in some way when she used it and doesn't want to admit it.", "Her job (former job?) should have all the other woman's information on file. She should go ask. Perhaps another employee or former employee knows the \"friends\" name.", "Call the employer and ask about this person. Then you can do a search and I bet you can find their phone number and address. Who knows if they ever had your tent but it can\u2019t hurt to ask"]}
