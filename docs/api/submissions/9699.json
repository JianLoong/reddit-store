I am currently trying to limit the amount of alcohol I am drinking so I can cut, but my girlfriend was not so we had very different drinking habits there.\n\nDuring the 3 or 4 hours we were there I had like 3 white claws while my girlfriend drank to get drunk with her girls that were there. Eventually we got to a point where it was very clear my girlfriend wasn\u2019t doing well, so I decided to drive her home.\n\nLike I said she was very drunk, so she was wasn\u2019t walking straight, was a bit incoherent  and once we left the house, she threw up in the bushes. I was there with her the whole time and asked one of our pledges to get me some water and Gatorade for her.\n\nWhile we were waiting, these two random girls ran up on us and were trying to talk to us. I\u2019m convinced one was on something as she was convinced she was friends with my girlfriend and said that she\u2019d take her home. I explained the situation and told her that I would be taking her home. \n\nThe girls wouldn\u2019t leave us alone and despite me telling them that my girlfriend is in fact my girlfriend, they refused to believe us. My girlfriend was again off her ass and was in her own drunk world and wasn\u2019t being helpful. \n\nEventually I just grabbed my girlfriend and tried to get to my car so we could leave but these two girls refused to let me leave. They literally stood in front of me and tried to pull my girlfriend off of me. I was trying to push through them and they would not let me go. At this point I was so fucking tired of whatever dumb shit they were trying to do so I went off.\n\nI told them that they needed to get the fuck out of my way. I told them that they\u2019re need to leave me and my girlfriend alone before they do something they regret. They decided to continue be dicks about this and I walked through them. I finally got my girlfriend to my car and they continued to bitch at me and were telling me to leave my girlfriend alone. Finally some of my brother saw us and came and distracted them while I got my girlfriend into the car and was able to drive off.\n\nThis morning I got multiple DM\u2019s about what happened from one of the girls that attended the party. She explained that she knew the girls they thought my girlfriend was \u201din danger\u201d and they wanted to help her. She demanded I apologize to them for how I acted, yelling at them and walking through them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676133896, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zrvth/aita_for_yelling_some_chicks_that_were_preventing/", "score": 7319, "replies": ["This thread is now locked due to an excess of rule violations. \r\n\r\n[Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) ||| [\"FAQs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)", "NAH.  I\u2019d say this is just a really unfortunate situation where nobody did very much wrong.  I don\u2019t blame these young women for jumping to conclusions when they saw a sober guy taking a wasted woman home - women deal with SO many creeps that it\u2019s not an unreasonable thing to think, and I\u2019m sure they acted with your GF\u2019s best interests at heart.\n\nOn the other hand, you certainly did nothing wrong in taking her back, and it\u2019s understandable that you asserted yourself strongly when your explanations were ignored, you were being physically obstructed and essentially accused of crimes that you categorically were not committing.\n\nIf there has to be an AH here it\u2019s the girl hitting you up via DM after the fact, still acting like you\u2019re in the wrong, when really everyone involved should just acknowledge the misunderstanding and move on.", "NAH. I get it\u2019s probably frustrating, but maybe just think of how thankful you would be for those girls if your gf went out alone and someone tried to take her home. \n\nThe world is a scary place, and it\u2019s hard to override that part of us that wants to protect other women. Like I see a woman in danger, and all logic goes out the window. It\u2019s just protect, protect, protect.", "NAH - The other woman wasn\u2019t \u201con something.\u201d She was pretending to be your girlfriend\u2019s friend because that\u2019s a common thing women do to look out for each other. Even if it\u2019s a stranger, if they believe another woman is in danger of assault, they will jump in and pretend to be her friend in order to get her away from the situation.\n\nI don\u2019t think you were wrong for snapping or getting frustrated, because while they were entirely good-intentioned, it was still unfair to you while you were trying to just get your drunk girlfriend home. Could there have been quicker and simpler ways to end this conflict before it escalated, though? Like photos on your phone, or walking back into the party so your fraternity or other friends could corroborate your identity? Or you said you sent pledges to get water and Gatorade, could you have waited for them to come back so they could confirm who you were? Like I said I don\u2019t think you were an AH (and neither were they) as this sounds like a high-stress situation for all involved, but try to keep these things in mind for future outings in order to deescalate the situation.", "I can see it from their side.\n\nYou were trying to get a blackout drunk chick into a car after a fraternity party, they were just trying to look out for her.\n\nNAH, because I can also understand your frustration", "NAH, the girls did the right thing based on what information they had - which is a sober man was trying to take a highly drunk girl home by himself. It is highly suspicious without the necessary context.\n\nObviously, you did the right thing by taking her home, but next time this occurs, work with them to show you are going to do the right thing. Maybe go home with a mutual sober female friend or two.\n\nOr don't get shitfaced in public.", "NAH. You were trying to take care of your girlfriend and  they were also. It's like an unspoken girl code, you pretend to know the person you're worried about and take them away from the guy causing problems. Obviously it can sometimes backfire. Send back a message that you appreciate knowing your girlfriend would have been looked after and protected if you weren't there and then drop it", "i doubt the woman who insisted she was your girlfriend's friend was \"on something.\" this is a really common thing for women to say when they're stepping in to try and help another woman out of a dangerous situation with a man. it gives the woman an out if she needs it (\"yes, [friend of many years], we should hang out! let's do it right now\"), and hopefully will scare the man out of raping/killing her, if that was his intention (if a friend sees him, they can report his appearance and last known location to the police)", "What they did was in the best interest of your GF.  \n\nFirst, why would they believe you? It could have been someone else at that party taking her out while you were in the kitchen playing beer pong (or whatever).  Even if you are an attentive BF who kept her in sight, not every bf is, and the girls outside have no way of knowing the difference between a good bf and a threat. The right thing to do would be to show them a recent pic and a recent text so they know you know her, and the text gives some reassurance that the pic is not old.  \n\nYou should be grateful that there are girls out there willing to step up.  I get that you may have been ignorant that this is indeed a thing and a very needful thing.  Ton of TikTok vids out there where it saved someone.  Take a google.\n\nBut now you know.  You can disregard what people are telling you and decide in your manfulness that all these women are wrong, but that would make you the AH. \n\nGoing forward, I think you should speak to the girls and let them know that you misunderstood what they were doing and thought they were a threat to your gf.  Tell them you now understand why they were acting the way they were.  Then y'all shake hands and agree to a fresh slate. You both did the right thing for your gf. But what we don't want happening is for women to have one more reason to fear helping when things don't seem right. If you can't do that. YTA.\n\nI am just glad that you really were the boyfriend.", "NAH. \n\nYou were trying to protect your girlfriend and you got frustrated that people were preventing you from doing so.\n\nThey wanted to prevent some presumably random guy from taking her somewhere while she was drunk", "NAH. They were trying to protect her, it's unfortunately common for guys to do this exact thing with a girl they don't know so that they can take advantage of her while she's drunk.\n\nObviously it's going to be very frustrating if you are actually her boyfriend and unaware of what they are trying to do.", "NAH. No assholes involved in this. Those girls had good intentions and didn\u2019t know that she was your girlfriend.", "NAH.\n\nThose women were using a common tactic to help other women from being in danger. It's a very common problem that women are assaulted, kidnapped, or worse especially if they are intoxicated. Assault happens a lot in university settings and this is a fear many women have and of course universities will sweep SA cases under the rug adding more pain to an already painful situation.  They were attempting to save your girlfriend was well intentioned. I would offer some reassurance to the women that your girlfriend is fine and thank them for trying to help.\n\nETA \"I'm her boyfriend\" is a common lie men who SA women say to escape with their victim. I can't fault the other women for not believing you. \n\nETA 2: thinking about it, you definitely should apologize for saying \"get out of my way before you regret it\". I get it that the moment was annoying for you but for them they were worried and possibly scared of what might happen. Also seems like you were going to blame them for your own actions.", "NAH. They were protecting her, as women. She wasn\u2019t on something, it\u2019s what we do if we think a girl we don\u2019t know needs help. \n\nYou\u2019re right to be frustrated but\u2026\n\nThey didn\u2019t know you or your intentions and it\u2019s a situation seen too often.", "INFO: Why didn't you just show them a picture of you and your GF together? Surely you have some type of digital evidence of your relationship.", "NAH. Except maybe your girlfriend is an AH for getting that drunk. All of you were just trying to watch out for her her. Honestly, with all the shit that goes down at frat parties, good on her friends for being certain that she wasn't going home with some random guy. I don't think you should have yelled, though.\n\nAlso, \"chicks\"? \"Girls\"? Really? They are women.", "NAH-I understand this is very frustrating but imagine if they\u2019d been right and someone random was trying to \u2018help\u2019 your girlfriend home.", "NAH - At the end of the day, you both had your girlfriends best interest at heart. Unfortunately, it wasn't handled in the best way by either sides.", "At least everyone actually had the best of intentions. I can see not wanting to leave your GF with two strangers. I can see it from both sides, you were in a situation trying to do the best you could for your gf and these girls were trying to protect her from what they thought was a predator. I don\u2019t think you need to apologize. Not the best situation but maybe pull up pics on social media of the two of you. Maybe a conversation with your GF about being wasted and something like this happening. Maybe the girls should have asked people, \u201cis that her bf, is she ok with him?\u201d Before charging in.", "NAH, you have to understand how common it is to have guys at parties take advantage of drunk girls. Be grateful that if she gets blackout drunk without you there, other girls will look out for her.", "NAH those girls were concerned and clearly were trying to do a good thing. Your behavior likely didn't help.", "NAH\nYou were concentrating on your girlfriend who was drunk and throwing up. But those girls have probably heard countless stories about girls being drunk at bars and parties being led by a man and assaulted, they were trying to make sure your girlfriend didn\u2019t have a story like that. They could have tried to verify if that was your girlfriend or you could have found someone who knew both of you to verify that was in fact your girlfriend.", "NAH. Drunk people are really annoying, I can understand how you lost your patience. I probably would too. But try to understand from a women\u2019s perspective.", "Honestly the only asshole here is the girl who demanded an apology the next day\n\nYou 100% shouldn\u2019t be treated like a criminal when you were being very mature and caring to make sure your partner got home safely. It\u2019s completely not fair to you and you shouldn\u2019t have to prove anything to them. You were super responsible making sure she was safe \n\nOn the other side, I totally get where they were coming from. A sober person leaving with a very drunk person from the outside looking in looks very alarming especially around a college campus. If they stop even one actual predator from getting a drunk person home to SA them then it\u2019s definitely worth it. That being said, they could have handled it with a lot more grace \n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong and probably didn\u2019t even realize their thought process / why they might have been trying to stop you \n\nNAH except the woman who demanded an apology for a genuine mix up", "On the one hand, I can understand your annoyance at them stopping you leaving, even if you sound a bit too dismissive of their concerns; on the other hand, I have seen dodgy guys trying to take drunk girls home who definitely weren't their girlfriends and I can understand where the girls were coming from, especially since they only had your word that she was your girlfriend. Not a fun situation in any case. \n\nEdited to add judgement: NAH", "NAH.\n\nNice of them to try to help. You could thank them for trying to look out for your girl however I don't think you owe them an apology. Why can't both parties be like \"We all wanted to help this girl and without knowing the full truth was understandably acting like an ass to each other. But now that we do, we should just let it go and move on.\"", "NAH look i get it its not nice to be accussed of something. But these girls saw some guy they dont know dragging a delirious drunk girl out of a house who keeps insisting hes fine and to get out of his way\n\nThey are trying to stop a bad situation from happening and you are just trying to help your gf\n\nBig thing id say is just have a picture on your phone of you together or something if this happens again. A few maybe just in case. Its the simplest way to prove your not some random creep. I say to people to always have pictures of your pets and kids for the same reason", "I posted this as a reply to another comment but considering the other votes I\u2019m seeing I wanted to get the opportunity to get voted down twice. \n\nI don\u2019t think that there is really an easy answer here. The truly sad thing is that I understand those women\u2019s motivation. This shit is scary and women are raped too frequently by men acting the exact same way OP was doing. But that is also the way a loving and caring boyfriend would act. \n\nTo those suggesting that OP should have calmly and rationally thought to think to show a picture of himself and his girlfriend, would you say the same thing to a black dad and his white passing daughter if someone just started trying to lead her away because they didn\u2019t think he was her dad? Don\u2019t get aggressive and calmly think in the heat of the moment when someone is trying to kidnap your loved one that you don\u2019t know and you know your loved one doesn\u2019t know?\n\nPersonally I say NAH. It is way too common for women to get raped like this, especially on college campuses. And we have definitely been preaching not to let it slide if you truly are worried for someone\u2019s safety. \n\nBut if you look at it from OP\u2019s perspective, as a man he\u2019s never had to think this way. So it looks like two random women are trying to kidnap his girlfriend in front of him because they\u2019re either drunk or on drugs. I can\u2019t say I blame him for not thinking they had a legitimate reason to acting the way they did and so calmly thinking oh I should just show them a picture because ***he*** knew his intentions are good.", "NAH they thought you roofied her", "NAH - I understand how frustrating it must have been for you but I can also see why they were so concerned. It is unfortunately something women/girls have to think about especially when drunk", "I was raped by men who were \"making sure I got home alright.\" One of them drugged me in a bar, and they walked me out once I was unable to walk by myself. I was obviously incapacitated, but this was the 90s and nobody was really as tuned in to checking on a woman if she's being \"helped\" out of a party or bar this way.\n\nThose girls didn't have any way of knowing what was happening, and while I can certainly see how inconvenient this was for you in the moment, and can understand feeling defensive there in the moment, they had to choose between the risk of pissing you off and slowing down your exit for no reason, and the risk of letting a woman get raped.\n\nThey made the right choice, *especially* in light of: My girlfriend was again off her ass and was in her own drunk world and wasn\u2019t being helpful.\"\n\nYou're not TA, necessarily, for reacting impatiently in the moment, but your friend is right: they deserve an apology. YTA.\n\n*Edit: fixed typo*", "NAH. Just barely. These girls were just looking out for your girlfriend.", "Only AH is your girlfriend for getting that drunk. You were trying to take her home. The girls were trying to keep her safe. They saw you outside a frat party with a drunk girl unable to communicate. I would've done the same thing. No need for you or the girls to apologize. It was a misunderstanding.", "YTA\n\nWhat those girls did is a common tactic among girls to protect each other.  They saw a very drunk girl being (in their eyes) separated from the party and manhandled into a car by a random guy.\n\nPretending to know a girl that you perceive to be in danger is a common trick to give the girl a way out of possibly sketchy situations.\n\nYour response was to behave in a threatening manner towards them (\u201cI told them they needed to get the fuck out of my way. I told them that they\u2019re need to leave me and my girlfriend alone before they do something they regret.\u201d) which just set off their alarms even more.  \n\nThey were trying to protect a very drunk and incoherent girl from being dragged out of a party and stuffed into a car by a man she couldn\u2019t identify.  You got aggressive with them.  YTA.", "EHS\n\nYour gf needs to learn her limit. You can get drunk without getting so sloppy you can't tell someone \"I'm fine, this is my bf\"\n\nThe girls were trying to make sure your gf was safe and not being taken advantage of while visibly drunk. Instead of yelling and screaming, they could've explained their reasoning and asked to see a pic of you two together or something.\n\nAs for you, I guess common sense isn't common. Clearly they were trying to prevent you from leaving with your gf, it would have been much simpler pulling out your phone, showing quick pic to confirm, and been thankful someone was looking out for her instead of fighting your way thru them.", "Yeah, this is a tough one.  The biggest asshole, by far, is your girlfriend - puking in bushes and being blackout drunk isn't at all necessary to have a wonderful time (though it may redeem the dismal experience of \"partying\" at a fraternity). You can thank her for putting you in this position, which, it should be said, wasn't covered in glory by anyone.  A possible way forward would be for you to ask the girls how they feel you should have proven to them that your girlfriend is indeed your girlfriend.  Because, while I admire their tenacity in trying to look out for your GF, it also seemed that there was no convincing them that you had her best interests at heart (which you unquestionably did), which would be frustrating if you were sober and surrounded by a bunch of drunk idiots, however well-intentioned.  It's fascinating to me that the kids are so tragically inept at having a bacchanale that ends well for everyone, but that's another conversation for another day.   What's the acronym for \"everyone here didn't do nearly as well as they should have, especially your drunk girlfriend.\"", "I mean as a woman when you see a situation that is dangerous you try to intervene. Thank goodness you were who you said you were and you didn\u2019t take advantage of your drunk girlfriend (I am hoping)\u2026\nWhile the girls may have been annoying I commend them! As far as you apologizing- I think you could thank them for looking out and since you are in a fraternity you could see about a plan to help drunk people be safe.", "NAH. I completely understand your upset and frustration. You were trying to get your gf home. BUT those girls didn\u2019t know you are her bf; for all they knew, you were lying. They thought they were protecting her. I can say, as someone who has been drugged and assaulted at a frat party, I wish someone had been that proactive for me instead of watching me be dragged off. You\u2019re not an AH for being mad, but they\u2019re not AHs either.", "NAH\n\nThe girl wasn't \" on something\" as soon as you said she insisted she knew her I knew what was happening ...the situation looked suspicious... And these girls were trying to help. Isn't that what you would want them to do? What if this was another person with your girlfriend these girls could have saved her life ( not exaggerating)\nI think men often don't understand why and how hard it is pushed on us to take care of each other and ourselves to protect us from bad situation.\n\nYou weren't doing anything wrong and just wanted to go home with your gf.\n\nNext time if suggest something super simple tell them you understand their concern BUT this is your girlfriend and then show them pictures on your phone of you guys together.", "NAH but these women rock for trying to protect an other woman. Granted the \u201cI\u2019m her bf\u201d excuse is used often and women get SAd. Shoulda pulled a pic up or something", "NAH  \nThey were trying to protect her, you were trying to protect her.  \n\n\nWhat is the point in drinking so much at parties, where is the fun (this is a real general question) ?", "NAH, Next time (and judging from what OP said - there will be), get a couple of your girlfriend\u2019s girl friends to help you get her into the car.  1 guy and 2 girls helping an extremely drunk girl shouldn\u2019t raise any red flags!", "YTA they lied about being her friend because they thought they were preventing a kidnapping/date rape situation. Your comment about \"before you regret it\" was uncalled for", "Your GF is TA in this situation for getting so drunk that she wasn\u2019t even coherent enough to tell these girls to stop and that you were her BF. What did she say when she sobered up and found out what happened? She\u2019s the one who needs to apologize to those girls. Im sorry you went through this!", "Soft yta. I understand your frustration,  fren, but you should have calmly explained and provided proof (do you not have pics together? On your phones?) rather than getting rude and aggressive, which likely made them more suspicious.\nAlso you talk about women dismissively/degradingly and you should fix that.", "Honestly if anything, you could have shown them proof of y'all dating, like recent texts and photos, cuz they were just trying to protect your girlfriend. Now yeah it's frustrating that they accused you but you should be thankful of them for trying to protect her. You don't need to apologize for it, but neither do they. In my opinion they deserve to be thanked more than anything. They might of been wrong about what was happening but in the end, those girls are heros. If I was your girlfriend, I'd want both of us to thank them. Like say sorry for getting frustrated but that you're thankful for them looking out for your girlfriend and make sure your girlfriend actually knows what happened", "YTA. Kudos to those girls. The best thing to do would show them a thread of a conversation between you and your gf or find someone who knows you and your gf or show photos of you with your gf. You should have tried to put their mind at ease.", "I'm sorry to say this, but those girls are heros. Guys get girls drunk and take advantage. You should be glad someone was looking out for your gf, just like you were. You all wanted to help protect and take care of her. Next time I suggest pulling out your phone and showing them a few photos of you together so they know you're really together. I think there are no assholes here.", "W those girls\nYou have no idea how many people get raped that way\n\"She is my gf\"", "NAH You did nothing wrong, but they were right to be concerned because so many times there is something wrong in a situation like that. I think it was a misunderstanding.", "I'm just trying to understand the reddit here. OP states that his girlfriend was not feeling well, due to which, he wanted to take her home as soon as possible, so that he will feel better. So, maybe everyone agrees that he was good till then.\n\nThen comes the factor of 2 girls trying to stop a inexistant potential SA from occurring by trying to lie through their teeth, but with good intentions. And despite him telling that he has to take care of his girlfriend, they do not trust (understandable) or listen to him. They kept on hounding the couple to the extent of physically trying to move the gf from OP. All this with good intentions towards the girl. But, imagine yourself in his place, some stranger trying to pull your SO from you, in the guise of being their supposed friend. How would you react to that? Calmly explain stuff? Or make sure to get your SO away from them? Isn't that what OP did? He only got aggressive, when they did. \n\nImagine, 2 girls seeing another girl being taken away, surely dangers of SA there, so you all are giving them the leeway to behave whatever way they want, just because there intentions are in the right place. But on the other hand, someone is trying to safeguard the interests and safety of his SO, from strangers and not even the acquaintance of the girl and the SO not being in the best of her health. And on top of all this, the OP has to apologize, trying to safeguard his gf, and only going to that act, when the other people were getting aggressive. \n\nIf they had asked this while being high, maybe things would be different. If this all continued after they all sobered up, and their main concern was the safety of the girl, why are they even demanding an apology? Or why is anyone?\n\nJust to correlate this to something people might hopefully understand. Imagine that you are out with your kid, and for some reason, your kid faints. You don't know why, but want to take him to the doctor soon and try to find out what the issue is. And in between all this, some stranger walks in, with good intentions, and tries to ask about why you are taking a unconscious kid, that they know the kid, and asks you to let them take care of the kid. Even after you try to explain that the kid is yours, in that state of worry, would you really think of showing them some proof that the kid is yours? That time, the proof wouldn't matter at all. You just want your kid to be alright, and that is exactly what's happening here. I know the parallel I tried to pull is kind of a far shot, but it was the closest thing I could think of.\n\nAbout my decision om this, NAH. But if the girls press and demand an apology, I will change it to NTA.", "No you\u2019re not the asshole you\u2019re a good dude trying to do the right thing. Unfortunately, they are also trying to do the right thing. You\u2019re both in the right imo however I do think it could\u2019ve been handled differently if you had people verify to them that you were actually together or like you give them her license or something and answer her birthday and adress and shit like that.

You had an opportunity to think about your story and write thoughtfully, and you went with \"chicks.\" My dude. It's 2023. Be better.\n\n3. I see you in the comments insisting that you shouldn't be assumed guilty just because you're a guy. But very bad news for you: lots of men hurt women. Women are rightfully afraid of men, and these women were brave to stand up to you. Not all men, yeah, yeah. Enough men, though. \n\nIf you want to avoid this situation in the future, have a talk with your girlfriend and figure out a better plan.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards!", "Somewhere between ESH and NAH\n\nBoth parties had your girlfriends best interests at heart, both parties could have reacted better\n\nI'd probably just chalk it up to an awkward experience and move on.\n\nI'd say you should apologise for yelling as long as they also apologise for not believing you and being stubborn", "I would say NAH but your aggressive behavior towards the women leaves my judgment at a soft YTA. You were perfectly sober and could\u2019ve easily explained, in a calm manner, what was going on. All these women saw was a man with a very intoxicated woman, and when they tried to step in you were aggressive and standoffish. They were well within their rights to question you in that situation. But ultimately it was a misunderstanding, so no one is really at fault.", "YTA - Dude, use your brain. Think what would you like to happen if you were not the guy by your girlfriend's side. Would you like those girls to immediately belive the rando or try to stop your girlfriend from potentially being raped and/or hurt and/or murdered? \n\nYou could have easily showed them a picture of you together, but instead you insulted them and became agressive. No-one is going to believe you have good intentions if you're agressive to people who try to protect your girlfriend.", "Why could you not sober realise that they were just trying to protect your gf which you should be grateful for. How hard would it have been to pull up a photo or two of you and your gf to prove you weren\u2019t a creep? YTA", "Low key YTA. Your intentions were good but you do need to know that a man leading a very drunk woman away from a frat party often does mean danger, so those women did have reason to think something wasn't right.", "Only slight YTA in not understanding why the girls acted that way even after other people tried to explain their side of the story \n\n\nJust show a picture of both of you next time. Heck even try to call one of your or her friends at the party to vouch for you.\n\nThe girls pretended to be friends because they thought you were a predator. You obviously aren't, but you (naturally) got defensive and aggressive when they were not letting you protect your gf. Doing so only affirmed their beliefs that the situation looked really bad. \n\nIf your gf went to a party and got drunk, I hope those girls would be as aggressive if a stranger tried to take your gf to their home.", "YTA. There were a lot of things you could have done, like finding  mutual friends, showing pics of you together, etc. Instead you decided to be offended that anyone would question you. Your arrogant response is exactly the same one that a kidnapper would use. \n\nI know that my girlfriends saved me from a guy who probably drugged my drink. Educate yourself about why they would step in and find a peaceful solution next time.", "Nah", "Reading your responses, YTA. It sounds like you care more about your convenience than your GFs safety. You chose escalation at every point because \u201cdamnit you\u2019re a man and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with these silly girls.\u201d \n\nAt any point you could\u2019ve solved the problem and deescalated the situation by simply showing those concerned women some proof on your phone or your GFs phone.\n\nIMO they did the right thing - looking out for a black out drunk woman. You did the wrong thing - being more concerned with your convenience that you escalated a situation that could have been easily deescalated.", "INFO did you not think that you could perhaps have shown the girls photos of you and your girlfriend together to prove that was your girlfriend? it seems like the girls were just trying to make sure that she was okay - it's common for women to pretend to know a woman who they think might be in danger to protect her, id also feel suspicious if i saw a completely sober man with an absolutely wasted woman trying to get her into a car", "Are they gonna apologize for accusing you of being a predator?", "NTA but neither were they. It was just an unfortunate situation. All of you were trying to protect your gf and it just got out of hand. In the future, maybe keep some pictures of the two of you on hand or show them texts between the two of you. While you shouldn't have to prove your relationship, it's a scary world out there for a drunk woman and it's not a bad thing that those girls wanted to look out for her. Maybe talk to your gf about this though and let her know that getting *this* drunk does hinder your ability to care for her. If she's so drunk that she can't assure some random women that she's safe then that's maybe a little tooooo drunk.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am currently trying to limit the amount of alcohol I am drinking so I can cut, but my girlfriend was not so we had very different drinking habits there.\n\nDuring the 3 or 4 hours we were there I had like 3 white claws while my girlfriend drank to get drunk with her girls that were there. Eventually we got to a point where it was very clear my girlfriend wasn\u2019t doing well, so I decided to drive her home.\n\nLike I said she was very drunk, so she was wasn\u2019t walking straight, was a bit incoherent  and once we left the house, she threw up in the bushes. I was there with her the whole time and asked one of our pledges to get me some water and Gatorade for her.\n\nWhile we were waiting, these two random girls ran up on us and were trying to talk to us. I\u2019m convinced one was on something as she was convinced she was friends with my girlfriend and said that she\u2019d take her home. I explained the situation and told her that I would be taking her home. \n\nThe girls wouldn\u2019t leave us alone and despite me telling them that my girlfriend is in fact my girlfriend, they refused to believe us. My girlfriend was again off her ass and was in her own drunk world and wasn\u2019t being helpful. \n\nEventually I just grabbed my girlfriend and tried to get to my car so we could leave but these two girls refused to let me leave. They literally stood in front of me and tried to pull my girlfriend off of me. I was trying to push through them and they would not let me go. At this point I was so fucking tired of whatever dumb shit they were trying to do so I went off.\n\nI told them that they needed to get the fuck out of my way. I told them that they\u2019re need to leave me and my girlfriend alone before they do something they regret. They decided to continue be dicks about this and I walked through them. I finally got my girlfriend to my car and they continued to bitch at me and were telling me to leave my girlfriend alone. Finally some of my brother saw us and came and distracted them while I got my girlfriend into the car and was able to drive off.\n\nThis morning I got multiple DM\u2019s about what happened from one of the girls that attended the party. She explained that she knew the girls they thought my girlfriend was \u201din danger\u201d and they wanted to help her. She demanded I apologize to them for how I acted, yelling at them and walking through them.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was an unfortunate misunderstanding. \n\nIf I were them, I\u2019d actually be reaching out to you to explain their part in the situation and sure then -mutually-apologize.", "NAH.\n\nYou don't owe them an apology and they don't owe you anything. They were just tryna make sure your gf was safe but no apology is needed.", "NAH. Your girlfriend was blessed to have everyone, friend or not, in her corner during her weakest moment. Not many women in her condition would've been this lucky.", "NAH \n\nI can understand how frustrating this is, but everyone had good intentions. \n\nFrom their point of view, they saw a very drunk woman being taken away from a party by a sober guy. Unfortunately women get taken advantage like this all the time, and we\u2019re always looking out for other women. \n\nBest thing to do in that scenario would be to show them your social media/pictures of you guys together or whatever, so they can actually see that you\u2019re telling the truth.\n\nObviously it\u2019s frustrating and you shouldn\u2019t have to do things like that, you should be able to look out for your own girlfriend without being cornered for it - but that\u2019s the world we live in. I wouldn\u2019t blame the girls for that. They had the right intentions. \n\nBlame the men who take advantage of women because they\u2019re the reason we have to be so hyper vigilant 24/7.", "Nah. Unfortunately our world today you can never be sure. Those girls were looking out for her seeing as you were sober enough to drive and didn\u2019t want anything to happen. You were doing the right thing. It was a misunderstanding and they should have let it slide after you explained the situation.", "NAH except maybe for your gf for getting shitfaced and the girl demanding you to apologize. But you did the right thing and the two other girls also did the right thing.", "NTA. However think of the alternative: what if you went to the party and someone else had tried to take your girlfriend \"home.\" These 2 girls would be heroes in your eyes then.\n\nThey did not know her, they only saw that a guy was trying to take a girl away from the party and they did not know if they could trust you or your words. They were trying to protect her as much as you were.\n\nJust a final note, if I were in this situation I would have pulled out my phone and shown them pictures of us on dates or similar. I would also apologize to them.", "NTA. This is a very nuanced situation and Redditors are making it a simple situation where as for you it\u2019s definitely not. This situation could have gone left really quickly.", "NTA.\n\nI get they thought they were trying to be helpful but they were abusing the taboo of using physical force on women to bully you, probably for just for the fun of it.  \n\nIf they really thought there was danger then they'd have gotten themselves hurt if you were someone who actually was happy hurting women and they could have easily called the cops if needed.  They could also have called someone at the party who knew you to verify if they didn't want to do that.\n\nThey are either very stupid or just wanted to pick a fight knowing they'd have \"cover\" from the consequences by claiming to be helping some random women being taken advantage of.", "NAH - hey, remember Brock Turner and what he did to that drunk girl behind a dumpster?\n\nYeah. \n\nIt sucks, but preventing a sober guy from taking home a really drunk girl is pretty grounded in reality as stopping a very bad thing from happening. \n\nYou may have felt harassed, but in those girl's minds there was a very real chance you had grabbed some random woman to take home and SA. Or worse. \n\nDunno if your phone lock screen is a picture of you and your girl, but it's likely that you could have diffused the situation by showing clear proof that you and your GF were close. Hopefully your GF is a bit more careful next time, but if it happens again, it might work.", "u/retoldjoke \n\nNAH, except the friend who demanded you apologize. You can tell her a cranky old feminist on the internet told you that the goal is to educate and encourage respect, not harangue people. Yelling at people who aren't harming others is not how we get the job done. She could have explained why it is important that women adhere to certain social protocols to ensure the safety of other women. If you only did what you said you did here, you don't owe anyone an apology. You didn't do anything wrong. \n\nYou might read through the conversations here, then go back and tell the friend you now see why the women's behavior was understandable, and that perhaps you could all look at this as a positive thing where everyone was concerned for an intoxicated woman's safety, where everyone walks away with a better understanding of these kinds of dynamics.", "YTA.\n\n I get why you were annoyed, since YOU obviously knew you were in fact her boyfriend. They didn't know that.\n\nTry and view the situation from their POV:  \n**An incoherent drunken girl who can hardly walk being dragged to a car with a sober man.**   \n**Now how does that look?** \n\nYou should be grateful and happy that there are women out there ready to protect their fellow women from potential predators.   \nBut because of your aggressive reaction they might be reluctant to interfere the next time they see this scenario and who knows, then the man might actually be a predator who is taking advantage of a drunk or drugged girl. \n\nThat is why YTA.", "NTA.  I get what they were trying to do, and they may have been genuinely concerned, but demanding an apology instead of apologizing for making a mistake made it seem like they didn\u2019t really care.  Sucks you were put in such a position, and hopefully your gf will lay off the heavy drinking soon\u2026", "YTA. They questioned you. You said exactly what a predator would say. They tried to stop you. You got aggressive with them and used your physical strength to push through them\u2026just like a predator would force himself on a drunk woman. Nothing you did in the situation would have given me confidence that you were who you said you were. \n\nCall a friend over to vouch for you, get your drunk off her ass GF to speak up, show photos on your phone, thank them for looking out for drunk girls everywhere instead of becoming adversarial. Did you do any of those things? Nope.", "YTA. Sorry, I get that you were frustrated and they were drunk, but women being sexually abused and raped while they were drunk is sadly a lot more common than you'd think. These girls were just trying to look out for your girlfriend\n\nI don't get how it didn't occur to you for one second to just assuage their worries and sort out the situation.", "YTA\n\nThe girls were doing what any smart and kind woman would do - attempting to look out for another woman who was obviously in no shape to prevent being raped or worse.\n\nDo you realize how many woman are raped or killed by men - rape is still rape even if you know the woman because there is no consent possible.\n\nYou could have de-escalated the situation quite easily by realizing where they were coming from in terms of being good citizens and showing that she was your girlfriend by showing pictures of you together or getting one of your friends to vouch for you instead of having some \"bros\" distract them.\n\nAgain there are way too many stories of frat bros who look the other way while unsuspecting women are raped or molested in the frat houses. Sometimes the women who appear to be vulnerable are even targeted in terms of getting them as drunk as possible.\n\nYour GF isn't an asshole but she is really stupid to get so drunk that she literally has no ability to protect herself. Again that is how women wind up raped or murdered.\n\nETA - My college years are behind me and there wasn't the same emphasis on safety but I wouldn't be surprised if colleges and sororities now taught women to be proactive in terms of attempting to ascertain whether a very drunk woman was in a potentially dangerous situation.", "The referring to women as \u201cchicks\u201d threw me. I forgot ppl still do that. I was picturing baby birds instead of like, human women \ud83d\ude02", "I get what they were trying to do and it's really nice of them, and I would've voted N A H for that, but demanding an apology? Yeah, you're NTA.", "Yta. You don\u2019t have pics of you and your gf together? That would have been the easiest solution. I know that you shouldn\u2019t have to justify your relationship with her in a perfect world but so many guys lie. I have intercepted guys faking their relationship with a girl to get into their dorm room so I can\u2019t be too mad at the girls in this case.", "From a purely ethics-based standpoint? N-A-H. Everyone involved was looking out for the girl who apparently was so drunk she couldn't walk well, couldn't talk well, and vomited. Girls are taught from a young age (my mother has been telling me about this since I was like five) to not leave a drunk girl alone, ESPECIALLY with a man. It's unfortunate, but in the name of safety you kinda have to assume any sober guy alone with a blackout drunk girl at a party or bar doesn't have the best intentions.\n\nYou, obviously, were trying to take care of your clearly inebriated girlfriend. But from the viewpoint of anyone who doesn't know both you and her, it doesn't look like that. It looks like a sober man taking a drunk girl home. \n\nFrom an actions standpoint, E-S-H. They didn't handle it well, and rather than asking for proof or finding someone who could confirm your story (according to you) they just told you to leave her alone (valid) and tried to yank her away (not cool, but also we only have it according to you).\n\nYou were an ass here. Rather than offering proof of your relationship or finding someone who could confirm it, you just yelled at and threatened them. And now, rather than describing what happened in much detail at all you choose to simply say they bitched at you and were dicks. Not to mention you're being purposefully obtuse in the comment sections, completely disregarding many valid points.\n\nAt the end of the day? YTA. They were standing up for someone that they may have actually known, just because you didn't recognize them doesn't mean they didn't know her. They did what girls are taught to do when they see another girl in potential danger. Did they do it well? No. But they were trying to help.\n\nYou, too, were trying to take care of your gf, sure. But you were an ass about it and did not do anything to support your point, seemingly thinking that they'd believe you just because you were telling the truth. But, as many people have told you, that's a common lie told by r*pists to be able to get girls alone with them. \n\nAnd now here we are. I wouldn't say anyone is owed an apology, since this is the type of situation that's just best left in the past and told as a \"back in college...\" story. If you ever run into the girls, both parties should definitely say something along the lines of \"hey remember that night... yeah sorry about that but...\" and then move on.\n\nIn the end you acted like a textbook predator. Obviously your intentions were very much in the right, but you didn't explain it well and the situation escalated. I mean dude. Assuming that someone is high because they act in a way you don't appreciate? Really?", "the ignorant men in the comments have no idea what it\u2019s like being a woman living in a man\u2019s world where other women have to look out for each other. you were sober dude, instead of your anger and believing for some reason those women were being an AH to you - you resulted into being the AH in the entire situation. \n\nthey\u2019re bad guys out there that use the same line \u201cthis is my girlfriend\u201d and then you see that girl on the news the very next day. \n\nyou need to work on your communication and your girlfriend needs to work on her alcohol intake. you infact need to apologize to those women because there could be a time that you may not be there to save the day, hopefully other women are there to step in like they were that night\n\nedit: spelling error oops", "YTA. They thought you were abducting a clearly incoherent girl and were trying to help her. That\u2019s a stand-up move. While I could see how that would be annoying to deal with, yelling at them and threatening them was a dick move.\n\nNow that everyone\u2019s sobered up, you could all get together and clear the air. No harm in that.", "YTA. First of all you weren't sober enough to drive - 3 white claws is 3 too many if you are gonna do any driving. \n\nYTA when it comes to the girls as well. They were doing the best thing they could in trying to protect someone they saw in a dangerous situation. I wish more people - men and women both - would do this. Again, you had 3 white claws so you were not sober yourself and so your thinking would have been impaired. Also, something must've been really off to them for those girls to try and intervene. How exactly were you talking to your gf, how were you treating her? And what does she say about this now?\n\nThere's a lesson here for everyone, if you are the designated driver then don't drink. If you are going to drink then get a cab/uber/whatever. Also, if someone thinks the person you are with is in danger, perhaps just don't get aggressive and set more alarm bells off.", "NTA, You explained who you were, and they kept on.  There was no way to prove you were the boyfriend if your GF was incoherent.  On the other hand, they couldn't prove to you that they even knew her either.  Sort of standoff.  But you got your GF home safely and that's all that matters.\n\nIf you want to apologize to those girls, go for it BUT they should apologize to you for the exact same reason.\n\nAnd let's not forget your GF in all this.  She PURPOSELY got wasted and was the root cause of everything that happened after that.  She was completely responsible for the condition she was in.", "YTA Those girls were absolutely doing the right thing and you were TA to them. You could have responded calmly or gone (or sent a friend to get) one of your gf\u2019s friends to confirm. Or shown them her social media with pics of you guys. Something other than being dismissive and aggressive. \n\nAnd quite frankly you deserve the label TA just because you have no effing clue as to why women might be concerned about a guy \u2018helping\u2019 a woman drunk off her ass out of a party and into a car. Like wtf??", "YTA because of how you treated them and how you are speaking about them now in your post. They were trying to look out for an intoxicated woman begging dragged to a car by a man they didn\u2019t know. They were doing a good thing.

You were in the classic case of \"Damned if you do damned if you don't\".

A total stranger going up and trying to take OP's girlfriend? You guys applaud this? Its one thing if HER FRIENDS did this but then ya know...they would know who OP is.

They don\u2019t know he\u2019s her BF, and they don\u2019t know how he\u2019d react if they tried to protect her. \n\nThey are their own situations, but OPs fear of being racially profiled and the dangerous consequences that could arise from escalating are not unlike those women\u2019s fear for OP\u2019s GF. As women we are taught not to trust men, because nearly all women have experienced some sort of sexual harassment and almost half have experienced sexual assault. \n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking OP to consider.

You could prouve them it was your gf by pics or else. They were concern ant it\u2019s normal. Shits like this happen all the time.

Did I left her with someone dangerous ?\u00a0\u00bb", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. It\u2019s very clear that the two girls thought your girlfriend was in danger which is absolutely understandable considering the context clues: they were at a frat party, she was very drunk to the point she was incoherent (which from the outside looks like she was roofied), and you were much more sober and trying to to take her away. From the outside, a dude taking his drunk girlfriend home and a dude taking advantage of a girl\u2019s intoxicated state to hurt her look VERY VERY similar. The girls were following girl code and looking out for her.\n\nAt the same time, I get that this can feel insulting and annoying, especially because as a a black man at a predominantly white university, you\u2019ve probably been treated as if you were a threat or intending harm and this must have been triggering and especially hostile. \nI don\u2019t your original reaction makes you a bit of an ass, though you had a bunch of options when they didn\u2019t believe you immediately: you could have called one of your frat brothers or a friend of your gf over to confirm you were her bf or shown them pictures on your phone. If you\u2019d kept your cool more, the situation would probably been resolved much more peacefully. Still, considering the circumstances, that in itself doesn\u2019t make you the asshole. \n\nWhat does, in my opinion, is that you seem completely unwilling to take on the women\u2019s perspective here and to accept the judgment that you could and should have deescalated the situation. The two girls, as annoying as they were, thought you were someone intending to harm your girlfriend. As insulting as that might feel, that is something that is unfortunately really, really necessary because 1 in 3 women has experienced sexual violence in their lives. They acted out of genuine care. And if your girlfriend had been in this situation with any other dude but you, you\u2019d be thanking them instead of being angry.", "Genuine honesty here. I was so ready to tell you that Y. T. A.  As a female who has been assaulted sexually it is so important for us to see something say something. From your post 2 girls saw a guy walking a clearly intoxicated girl out to his car. Yes there should have been better ways for them to handle that but I get it. Then I read some of your comments and realized you are black which makes this more complicated I'm sure you spent your life people assuming the worst of you because of skin color. I am truly sorry for that, I can't even imagine how hard that must be. I honestly dont know whether those girls would have responded the same way if you were white or if you were helping a black girl. I want to hope they would but just because I want the world to be a better place doesn't mean it is and just because I would act a certain way doesn't mean every white woman would. \n\nWith both of those things in mind I will vote NAH unless you find out those women were racial motivated it is best to assume that they were trying to keep all females safe who are not able to do that for themselves (ie drunk or high or hurt) but I also understand where you are coming from not wanting people to assume you are guilty based off of nothing. \n\nMaybe try talking to those women and see if both parties can help teach each other something.", "A soft YTA - My dude, these are the same girls who will save her life if she ever gets roofied at a bar. Do you understand that? The \"safety checks\" women pull on one another are extremely important to our collective survival.

You were trying to protect her from what you thought were high people with bad intentions and they were trying to protect an obviously drunk woman from being drug home by a stranger from a frat party. Pretending to be a friend of the woman so she feels less alone is a good tactic that makes men back off when they see that the person that can\u2019t take care of themselves has someone who can.

But OP probably didn't know, and random strangers insisting they're taking your friend home makes a situation go from manageable to stressful with alarm bells -- at least in my experience.", "Let\u2019s see the options \n\n1.show them pics of them together \n2.call her phone to prove they know each other\n3.call some of their friends that were at a party to clarify that they know each other\n4.Not get defensive and say stuff like \u201cget the fuck away from me before you do something you regret\u201d \n5.not have male friends holding back girls while he drags his girlfriend to the car.", "Easy. Pull out his phone and show some pictures of them together.", "random women freaking out on him, drunk girlfriend providing no help... yeah, surely the real problem is how he wasn't calm enough", "Because instead of calmly thanking them for their concern, offering to let them come with, finding evidence that they came to the party together / are in a relationship etc; he acted like a person that was abducting a woman for the purposes of SA.", "Yeah that's fair I suppose. Honestly I think everyone was tired, and they all had the right intentiona. Things obviously got a bit too heated. But I'd say both sides are decent people.", "They could have claimed he was an ex or a friend trying to take advantage. Or what if his phone was dead. Then what? They needed to back off.", "Sorry, not handing my girlfriend over to random druggies in the middle of the night. That would be beyond irresponsible and stupid. Not trying to get her raped or mugged or something. OP is a good man! \n\nHis GF's druggy \"friends\" should apologize to him.", "People also lie to strangers in order to take advantage of them.\n\nDoes nobody here have any street smarts at all? Do you all just trust randoms?", "You misread the ending. They didn't demand an apology. Someone else from the party who knew the girls sent the message, not them.\n\nAnd there's zero indication that they are the ones demanding an apology. More likely, the messenger thinks OP is an AH (which I don't entirely agree with) and wants him to apologize to her friends.", "It doesn't need to be a romantic text, even just \"honey I'm at the store, do you need anything?\" Something that shows you're living together or at least know each other well.", "When some terminally inside loser decided they needed a soapbox to stand upon.", "What is fonzie?", "Better learn your limits quick though, there's no excuse for getting that drunk!", "The thing is, for all the girls knew, he was a stranger. If you actually see this from a completely unbiased perspective. A drunk girl is being carried/dragged/brought to the car by a guy. Girl is so drunk she has no idea what's going on. Guy who's with her, when stopped by two women says he's her boyfriend. They don't believe him and try to stop him from leaving with her. This whole thing would have been easily solved by OP showing a picture. The girls aren't trying to steal her or something. There are way too many documented and much more undocumented SA cases where the victim and I'm not saying always a girl but still majority of cases, involve the girl being excessively drunk or drugged. The guy or guys with her claim to be the BF. Are they? The situation when it started, nobody was the AH. But OP took the time to yell at the girls when he could have very quickly just shown he knows her. He said himself his GF was very unhelpful. Does he need to? Maybe not. But hypothetically if he's not the guy in this situation and some random guy pulls the I'm her BF act, would he still be this mad at those girls?", "...no, that has nothing to do with the situation in the OP. Nobody heard anyone being beaten/assaulted/abused.", "Not at all. While it was right for them to step in and make sure she was alright, they were being accusatory and not willing to reason at all. I'm sure one of them could have also asked, \"can you show us a pick of you two, get into her phone or go grab someone inside to verify what you're saying for us?,\" but instead they were obtuse about it and assumed he was a pervert because he was a sober man and she was drunk. There were way better ways for them to approach it, just like there were better ways for this guy to get them to back off. Difference was he was pressured into a corner, they chose to approach him like that.", "I'm not saying he should have handed her over to them or that he did anything wrong, but just his word that he's her boyfriend means nothing. If he had shown them a picture of him and her together or something else that proved he actually knew her, they would have let him be. All they see is some guy trying to leave with a super drunk girl, they were trying to protect her from being taken advantage of.", "User name checks out.", "When I'm being harassed and followed by a random man then yes, I trust the kind-looking woman who yells \"katie, haven't seen you in ages!\" and runs over to hug me. Women look out for that kind of thing. It IS being street smart as a woman. \n\nObviously in this instance OP's girlfriend couldn't say anything, and OP wasn't actually an attacker. But both parties were just trying to help in this situation.", "Like how those girls were supposed to trust he was actually her bf and not some random dude?", "That\u2019s the first thing I would have done", "I don\u2019t think that would have cleared things up, though. Showing photos just proves he knows her. He could easily be someone she\u2019d just broken up with, or someone who has terrorized her into staying in a relationship. They could easily have refused to listen to anything he has to say. Getting his friends to vouch for their relationship wasn\u2019t effective (and I can understand why it wouldn\u2019t be). If these women were also intoxicated and he believed them to be strangers what was really going to work? \n\nI don\u2019t argue that he should have yelled but I see just leaving and having the girlfriend clear things up in the morning as the only real solution. The women would still be upset in the morning that he ignored their attempts to help his girlfriend but oh well\u2026", "I don't think I have any pics on my phone of me and my husband together.", "Never ever call bitches chicks", "No, it is not sexist to call women chicks.\nSource: me, a girl, a woman, a chick, who also sometimes calls over women chicks. \n\nPlease go outside more.", "If you don\u2019t know, \u201cchicks\u201d has been derogatory longer than you\u2019ve been alive.", "Yeah I don't disagree with you at all. I've been saying the same thing about giving a photo. Although someone pointed out to me that the girls could've asked for a photo as well, which is kind of true. Either way I think both sides weren't doing anything wrong and they both got a bit heated. As for OP yelling, I do kind of understand, since he's probably tired, his gf is puking, and he just wants to get her home. Overall neither of them are an asshole.", "It's principle though. I'd rather annoy someone or come across as a dick personally than let someone be harmed.", "You know what means nothing? The words of random people who seem like they're on drugs in the middle of the night. OP owes them absolutely, positively nothing and would be a fool to linger even a moment longer than he needed to in a potentially dangerous situation like that where he's outnumbered in the middle of the night.\n\nDo none of you have any street smarts at all?", "Okay cool.\n\nAnyways if my girlfriend is drunk and I'm trying to get her home safe there's a 0% chance I'm stopping to talk to random people in the middle of the night I don't know.\n\nThey should have pulled up a picture of his GF on one of their phones if they wanted him to believe they were her friends.", "I have plenty of pictures of what matters. Mind your business. I don\u2019t need or want your pity.", "Yeah, I hear you. But did you feel OP was wielding a gendered term in a kind way or a way diminishing their goals? The issue seemed to be that they didn't immediately defer to him and his judgment. So he calls them chicks in his post. It's the context that really matters.", "Honestly fuck all words. Just delete language", "He never said they were \"druggies\". He assumed they were \"on something\" because they insisted that they were friends with his GF.", "It must be nice not to have to go to the lengths women do to keep themselves and other women safe from creeps.", "You have it. You have my pity. It\u2019s a shame to have no pictures of the person you built a life with and yourself. I feel sad that your immediate reaction is defence vs thinking \u2018yeah! We should get a pic once in a while\u2019. Lol.", "I think he called them chicks bc he just calls them chicks, I thought there were already enough issues to talk about that bringing up such an insignificant and maybe innocent thing kinda just a takes away some of the validation to your point bc it\u2019s now what everyone is talking about instead of the actual problems", "We have pictures of of \u201conce in a while\u201d. We do not, however, take stupid selfies that litter our phone for the sake of having photos. Important moments. Candid moments. You need to get a life if you think your intrusive comments are going to make people behave in a way you deem necessary. The audacity.", "Sounds like you do have photos then \ud83d\ude07 I\u2019m glad. It\u2019s really nice to have those memories to reflect back on if the important moments!", "NTA \n\nThey owe you an apology", "NTA. If they were that concerned they should have called the cops but didn\u2019t.", "That\u2019s how some people talk just calm down", "Lmao Jesus do you not know what face to face interactions with real humans look and sound like?", "What do you recommend as a plan? To just leave the girl ? Seems like op shouldn\u2019t have to take such a huge risk in trying to take care of his girlfriend.", "What if the girls were rapists?", "Happy Cake Day!", "Exactly it\u2019s like when a person crosses the road when they see a black guy", "Personally, if someone was assuming that I was essentially kidnapping someone they didn\u2019t know, I wouldn\u2019t want to interact with them at all. I get looking out for someone who you might think is in danger, but if you don\u2019t know them, and the person is insisting that they do, you let it be. \n\nIf he was trying to run off with a strange girl, you wouldn\u2019t have to physically grab her away. He would\u2019ve backed off at the claim that they knew her.", "He said he explained the situation and the girls didn\u2019t believe him. It sounds like they were also too drunk to be reasoned with.", "Dude pisses some people off too. Crazy to me as a life long west coaster. We throw casual pronouns like dude, buddy, chick, etc., regularly.", "Some women are predators and some men are victims. NTA"]}
