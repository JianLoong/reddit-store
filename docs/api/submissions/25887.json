I reached out to a friend of mine from childhood to be our real estate agent. She sells a lot of homes and I thought she'd treat us right.\n\nWe found a place we loved and made an offer. After a brief bidding war, our bid was accepted. We signed a contract for the deal to move forward. \n\nRight after we signed the contract, our realtor told us we needed to schedule the home inspection. Fine with us. She told us the company we should use, but we have a guy our family and friends who do lots of real estate deals recommend highly. We told her we were selecting him. She freaked out.\n\nShe told us he is very difficult to work with. She said he \"brings a lunchbox and stays all day and finds every little thing wrong with the home.\"\n\nIsn't that the point?\n\nShe told us the sellers' agent would not approve of our guy and that the sellers would likely refuse him too. She advised us strongly against him and to go with her people or find someone else. We said no. \n\nWell, guess what? The sellers and their agent rejected our choice. Our realtor sent us a termination document to sign and we did so right away. It felt shady, like they were trying to hide something that was wrong with the house, which is close to 50 years old.\n\nLater that day, my realtor \"friend\" texted my husband and me, telling us that what we chose to do didn't sit right with her and she is no longer willing to be our realtor. Which is fine with us, as we no longer trust her. She was the listing agent on the house our sellers had just bought and we felt like maybe she was working in their best interest instead of ours (they have a lot more money than us). I just feel weird about her suggesting we did something wrong.\n\nAITA for not going with the home inspection company she suggested?\n\nEDIT: I showed this post to my husband and he reminded me of something I left out...\n\nWe told our agent after we signed the contract we wanted the inspector our friends and family recommended. She said the sellers' agent was \"going to fucking kill\" her and that he would not be okay with this. She said we should really use the company she was suggesting or at least find a different person than the guy of our choice. We said we would try to find someone else.\n\nThe next day, before we could pick a different person, we both received an email from her confirming the date and time of our home inspection with **the company she wanted us to use**. She had gone ahead and scheduled it for us.\n\nAt this point, my husband wrote to her and said we already told her no regarding that company and now we want to use the guy we originally wanted.\n\nIt was after this that she sent us the termination document.", "created_utc": 1693426787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165pihd/aita_for_terminating_a_contract_to_purchase_a_home/", "score": 767, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When a used car seller screwed you over, the consequence is relatively minor compared to being screwed over on a house purchase. The whole system of buying a house is rigged; from agents to appraisers to title insurance companies to mortgage brokers. The only somewhat independent entity you have is the inspector because you (buyer) pay for the service and they don't care if the house is sold or not. And in this case, they even want to corrupt that step. The only people truly happy about the sky high prices are the agents.

Hence, there is a disincentive for the listing agent to negotiate a lower price or conditions more favorable to the buyer. That is the job of a buyer's agent.
