Your inspector should be independent,  not in league with the realtor. Definitely something shady going on. Might even be worth reporting.", "NTA - why on earth would the seller even have input into who is completing the home inspection, I thought that was solely up to the discretion of the buyer.  At any rate, this sounds like you've dodged a COUPLE bullets.", "100% NTA. Consider yourself to have dodged a bullet.", "Absolutely NTA. Is what she did even legal over there? Sounds pretty dodgy and you should make a complaint about this.", "NTA.  Great job on insisting and getting out of a contract with obvious problems. She had no interest in protecting you so good riddance.", "NTA Rule number one in real estate is location, location, location. Rule number two is trust your instincts. You're commiting hundreds and thousands of dollars when you enter a purchase agreement for a home. If someone doesn't want a thorough inspection of a home prior to it's purchase, the home is a dog with fleas. And if your realtor wants to drop you as clients because you want your home inspected by someone other than \"their guy\", get another realtor.", "Completely NTA- a good inspector will save you massive problems down the road and they're worth their weight in gold. Your shady \"friend\", however, has completely shown her lack of ethics, and I wouldn't want to continue any relationship with her.", "NTA. I'm an office manager for a contracting company, and we see SO many houses that didn't pass inspection. Sure sometimes it's petty stuff like mold on the vents or dips in the floor. But there's also water damage from mistreated roofs. Backwards ass DIY plumbing, mold on the walls, appliances installed incorrectly, windows that are rotting off the sides of the house, don't even get me STARTED on the ventilation we've had to install. You're right to go with an independent inspector over a contracted one, they'll tell it to you straight. There's probably flood damage or carpenter ants or something.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey refused your home inspection?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means: THey KNOW there was something wrong, and they did not want you to find it, ebcause then they would officially know and ccan no longer avoid disclosing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" and she is no longer willing to be our realtor.

She was the listing agent on the house our sellers had just bought and we felt like maybe she was working in their best interest instead of ours\" .. you are right, and you dodged a bullet there. SHe is NOT YOUR friend.", "Definitely NTA. You want the inspector who treats their job seriously. Transparency is important for any transaction. \n\nHonestly your friend sounds terrible to not disclose the conflict of interest with the sellers ahead of time or recommend working with another agent. There's got to be some kind of ethical obligation to not double dip on a transaction. \n\nNever go into business deals with friends or family.", "They wanted someone to rubber stamp amd not actually check. Which is literally the inspector's job.", "NTA makes me think something is wrong with the home and they want to use their hand selected inspector to make sure it stays hidden. The one thing I learned from buying a place and being fucked over by the inspection is to have my own inspector do the inspection. You were right to walk away", "Nta. She is supposed to be working for you, not fr the sellers.", "NTA, why is this even a question here? You listened to your instincts and acted on it. End of story.", "NTA\n\nI majorly regret going with the inspector my realtor suggested. Next time, I\u2019m going with the persnickety one.", "Nta", "NTA. But now I wanna know what the inspector would\u2019ve found lol", "NTA, Remember the realtor works for the homeowner unless you hire one as a purchasing agent.

A house is a major purchase and the inspection is so important!  Also, consider looking for a buyer's agent.", "My money is on lead paint or asbestos, there was definitely something they were not disclosing. NTA, sounds like you dodged a bullet and you may have grounds for at least a complaint to her broker if she's working under a brokerage.", "NTA. When we bought our house, my uncle, our realtor, asked if we wanted an inspector that would yes it all or one who was here all day. We went with the thorough guy. We still bought the house, but we went in knowing what was what. Her actions are suspicious.", "NTA. If multiple parties fear someone doing a thorough inspection then you most likely dodged a bullet. I'm surprised you actually got an offer accepted contingent on an inspection in this market. So many people are waiving inspections these days just to get a house.", "The family friend inspector might be able to advise them if there's some fishy collusion going on and whether they can report it \n\nOn the other hand, OP got a great recommendation for a home inspector to use for their next contract. The guy who brings his lunchbox and finds all of the problems.", "Yes! This didnt sound right to me either. To my understanding (and i bought 2 homes), the seller doesnt have any input when it comes to the home inspection.\nIts all up to you - unless because they already signed a contract, it was written in such a way that both parties had to agree?? But again, ive never heard of a home inspection after the fact either", "That\u2019s what I was thinking too. The seller should have zero say, and the realtor shouldn\u2019t have a say beyond \u201chere\u2019s a list of home inspectors in our area\u201d.", "When I bought my house, I put in an offer contingent on the inspection results, they accepted it, I scheduled and paid for the home inspection, and then negotiated with the sellers based on the findings of the inspection.  But they had no involvement with the inspection at all.", "Yes a conditional offer; but again the seller can\u2019t dictate who inspects the house.\n\nWhich makes me think that the real estate agent like put some wording in the offer that specifically said that both parties had to agree on the home inspector, or lied to the buyer that the seller needed to sign off on it"]}
