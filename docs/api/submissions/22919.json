And if you really aren't on the hook for the money, then refund it to your friends.", "Yes you would be.", "YTA. \n\nThe least assholish thing to do is to call the restaurant and pay for your meal again. Restaurants aren't high-margin businesses, and a couple of blown checks a month can be the difference between making bills and not. This goes double if there was a tip on your card which also got declined - you got service that deserved a tip, and through no fault of the server they're now not getting the money they worked for.\n\nThe only moderately assholish thing to do is to pay back your friends because of the windfall. I admit that this would be tempting to me if it was a big corporate chain restaurant, because I know how those places treat their employees. I mean, the server is still getting screwed (and if I went back and got them again, I would double-tip, in cash) but I don't have a lot of sympathy for those places.\n\nThe completely assholish thing to do is to keep all the money for yourself.
