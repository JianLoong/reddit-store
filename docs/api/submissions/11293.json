Has your husband considered seeing a therapist about his issues?", "NTA \n\nSleep is also Essential for your newborn, not just you, so if the baby sleeps (mostly) at night it should be reasonably quiet at night, especially if you have reactive/anxious dogs. I feel like screaming/talking while angry wasn't the best move, but considering you were exhausted and had just been awoken by startled dogs and a baby that's understandable. I see in the comments that your husband had a bad experience in therapy, and I understand that, but he needs to find a way to convey his reasoning, and I think that you two should have that conversation after calming down a bit.\n\nThere's also something else to consider. You said he was going to the garage to work, What does your husband do for work? Does be contribute to the business or work an outside job? Is he a House-Spouse? Does he sleep during the day or night or perhaps the dusk-dawn hours? Does he expect quiet when he sleeps? Does he help calm your daughter down when his noise wakes her or are you expected to do that yourself with no help from him?", "ESH, he for ignoring your request, you based on your response. It also sounds like you both haven't trained your dogs well if they are the cause of you waking up. Maybe instead of him changing his schedule, he can have the dogs with him while he cleans so they don't bark.", "NTA, is he neurodivergent perchance? I literally only ask as I was recently diagnosed with autism in my 30\u2019s and I\u2019ve had behaviors like only being able to clean my kitchen after my husband goes to bed.

It just stood out to me that he loves organizing and cleaning but at certain times. \n\nEither way, what he\u2019s doing is AH behavior, whether he realizes it or not.

He is burning daylight hours doing nothing and then insists on doing chores in the middle of the night. He should be sleeping like you and the baby are, or at least like you and the baby are trying to. He is being inconsiderate. \n\nI.N.F.O. What is he doing during normal waking hours that prevents him from doing these things at that time? Like, is he so overwhelmed with daily tasks that he isn't finished with them by 3 AM?", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't need to be working in the garage at 3 AM and waking up your family. Does he have a mental issue that prevents him from sleeping?\n\nHonestly, sounds like a bipolar or manic phase.", "NTA. While it's awesome that your husband wants to clean, since his cleaning at night wakes you up, he should have realized by now that he simply can't clean at night. He needs to do it during waking hours, as you have requested.", "ESH. Your reaction and calling him a selfish inconsiderate asshole---that's not the way to treat a partner. He could obviously make an adjustment to dish-time. But it seems like you're not addressing the real issue of \"why isn't he on a similar schedule as you.\"\n\nIf he's doing stuff at 3am, then why is that? Is he just a night owl? Is he ever getting into bed with you, does he get up at 7 as well? Does he work a weird shift? Is he sleeping all day or doing something else that means he's unproductive at that time? Is he cleaning as a compulsion?", "NTA. His response to you asking he not do this disruptive activity during your core sleeping hours is not good:\"I'm doing this for us.\" Is bonkers. If he really thinks this is helpful to you, the baby, and him, he needs to get back into therapy stat. You specifically asked he not do this during the time you absolutely need to recharge and he keeps doing it over your objections. So now you are sleep deprived, the baby is fine, and the dog is rewarded for making noise with attention from all of y'all. \n\nYou are going crazy with no sleep. He is preventing you from sleeping, your reaction (while rude) is understandable. If he absolutely needs to clean he do it during the day. If he's got insomnia or disordered sleep, then he needs a doctor. And he definitely needs a therapist. When is he sleeping? If he not sleeping either, y'all need some big help in the home.", "INFO: Is there a bedroom further away from the garage and kitchen? \n\nWhat kind of work does your husband do in the garage? Is it relating to his job/business? Have you done anything to lessen the noise or perhaps have white noise on? \n\nHave you tried training the dogs to recognize the normal household sounds and not bark? It takes a lot of work but it can be done. \n\nI ask these questions because as a night person living with a morning person, we have our bedroom in the room that is as far away as possible from our front door, kitchen, and office. \nWe have white noise going in our bedroom when we\u2019re sleeping. Our dog is trained not to bark at normal household noises or when we leave the house. \n\nEach of us works better at certain times and that\u2019s not always something easy to change. We have different schedules. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole here, except maybe in the way you both discuss it and try to solve the problem. \n\nI remember when my kids were babies and it was rough. It\u2019s easy to get upset when you aren\u2019t getting enough sleep.", "NAH. Sounds like you're both struggling with your kid and with everything that's going on. You're not the asshole for being mad about this, your husband isn't the asshole for having insomnia and trying to do something productive instead. It's extremely obvious that he's not, like setting an alarm to wake up at 3 am to do this. \n\nThe two of you should get some couples therapy to figure out a better way to deal with this than fighting, though. It's clear that this situation (new parents + insomnia) is being handled really badly by both of you and is causing a huge amount of what should be avoidable tension.\n\nI want to throw out that as someone who grew up around this, the other option is for your husband to just like... grab an ipad and sit in the bathroom reading or something. If that's where you two shake out that's probably fine, but that's going to make his insomnia worse and end up with him not putting the same effort into the two of you. \n\nI'd see what you can to to get him to look for a medical solution.", "NTA for being furious.

You can also share why it\u2019s a hardship and figure out what the barrier is for him cleaning during the day.", "NTA. Nighttime is for sleeping, especially with a baby. It\u2019s not for loud chores and reorganizing the house while everyone sleeps. It\u2019s nice he\u2019s doing those things, and it does better your home, but is he aware that same kitchen exists before 12am?", "Thank you, we have done a lot of therapy.

Has he always done this? \n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA here but it sounds like something else is going on because this is not typical or normal behavior. Obviously, arguing in the middle of the night is not helpful nor a practical solution to this problem. I would be madder than a hornet if anyone but my kids were waking me up at 3 am.... to clean!! Why is he choosing to do this & how are you stressing him out by requesting he go to bed? \n\nSorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Hopefully y\u2019all can find a solution soon & get some sleep!", "Then I'm inclined to say he is being an asshole. Not only to you and the baby but to himself. These things can be done during normal daylight hours. There is no reason to be up in the middle of the night doing household chores. He should be sleeping!", "NTA.   Sleep deprivation with a baby is awful.  When does he sleep? Is he a vampire?", "NTA. This is why I had the rule that if you wake the baby, you\u2019re putting her back to sleep.

His behavior is sus.", "NTA. He sounds like a vampire version of Felix Unger or Adrian Monk. Who TF gets up to do dishes at 3 in the morning especially when you have a newborn,  AND 2 dogs who are easily woken up AND he knows you have a 7 AM start time for your baby, and then working all day? I'm especially side-eyeing him for calling you crazy for your very reasonable request. Would he like it if you started blasting loud music or vacuuming, etc. while he's trying to sleep,?

Oh, well.", "You are NTA ma'am, and... While personally my, erm, default, reaction is to call Him the AH, I'll refrain... I will however say he is being a grade A jerk if he's repeatedly ignoring your calm, rested requests, and furthermore gets 'upset' at you when He wakes You, and your Baby up in the dead of hecking night when you work and the baby, well. Baby's need sleep. If nothing else he is being mighty disrespectful and selfish", "NTA\nMany multiple housing units define quiet hours, around 9-10 at night to 7-9ish in the morning. That is normally sleeping hours for most people.\n\nYour husband is disregarding this common courtesy. If it's dark out and the rest of the household is sleeping, he SHOULD be mindful of not disturbing the sleepers. \n\nIf he wakes the baby, he should tend the baby and let you go back to sleep. His late night cleaning frenzies are like a gift the recipient does not want and doesn't enjoy. \"But I got you this thing you SHOULD be grateful for, despite its actual unpleasant effect on you!\" \n\nAdequate sleep is a basic need. He is disturbing yours on a regular basis at a time when you're already struggling with sleep deprivation. The amount of sleep your body needs to feel fully rested is not negotiable. No more than how you breathe or needing adequate food is negotiable. His \"but I cleaned such and such an area,\" expecting his completely voluntary waking up the household to be eclipsed by his getting around to a chore at the worst possible time.", "NTA! Full disclosure, my husband does things like this too.\n\nI need to nap!\n\nI no sooner lay down and he comes inside and turns music on a little loud, starts banging around and muttering to himself how I don't help, etc. Cancer is hard, he's making it harder. I work and have worked since diagnosis.", "NTA- I\u2019m gonna go with NTA because you are sleep deprived but your husband is not the AH either. You yourself say he is wonderful. Your reaction was not a good one at all but you were sleep deprived and not sleeping affects absolutely everything in life. I have realized that lately. If I don\u2019t sleep I\u2019m useless. \n\nYou won\u2019t solve anything by screaming. It\u2019ll just make him and angrier. Clear the dinning room. Sit down together with no distractions and say \u201cwe need to talk\u201d. Sorry for screaming but I was feeling sleep deprived and  it\u2019s affecting me. \n\nThere are so many things you gotta tackle. \n\nFirst, your husband. \nYou said he has free time during the day. Does he have windows of time where he does nothing? Or is that nothing time spent with the baby? Does he sleep in when you are awake? Or is he not being able to sleep and is sleep deprived? Does he try to sleep with you and then wake ups? Is it possible he is just a night owl? There is no shame in that, some people work better at night, it\u2019s okay as long as they are healthy I think. Has he always been like this? Or is this suddenly? \n\nYou might want to look into the question \u201cwhy?\u201d Ask him why does he keep doing it after midnight? Or why does he feel like he has to? And keep asking why until you get to the root of the problem and then ask \u201chow can we solve this?\u201d \n\nMaybe you could both be needing couples time. Take some time to spend together with no baby. (I know it\u2019s almost impossible with a new born.) But maybe there is a communication problem and neither of you are listening to each other or really seeing each other. \n\nThe dogs. \nSeems like one of the biggest issues are the dogs. They shouldn\u2019t be barking every time your husband leave the room. I mean, they can follow him without barking. Maybe your husband can reach out to a trainer and explain the issues. Are they young pups? What can you do to prevent their barking? If they slept somewhere else, would that help? \n\nCouples will have different schedules sometimes. It\u2019s great, but it is life. So maybe look into how can you sound proof your room. \n\nAll the best.", "NTA. Most of the time when someone prefaces a story about their husband by saying \u201cmy husband is a wonderful man, but\u2026\u201d the story ends with the husband obviously not being wonderful. \n\nThis is one of those times. What a selfish inconsiderate asshat. You should be taking him throwing what he does in your face and saying you\u2019re ungrateful and crazy more seriously. He\u2019s essentially torturing you with lack of sleep, and then using that he\u2019s cleaning to avoid any repercussions or responsibility. And you\u2019re calling him wonderful? \n\nPlease raise your standards for the people in your life. This is borderline abusive behavior on his end. Many would argue it\u2019s just straight up abusive behavior. Please take this more seriously than you seem to be.", "NTA.\n\nBut can he keep the dogs with him if he's out in the garage or cleaning? Cut down on the noise somehow?\n\nI would do everything except vacuuming at night, because it was my time to put on headphones and have time to myself without our four kids or husband needing me. I was having problems sleeping, so if I wasn't cleaning I was out walking. And for awhile when my cousin was waitressing on the night shift I would take a book and hang out at her restaurant.\n\nAnyway, he does need to pull his head out of his ass and realize that if you and the baby aren't sleeping well, that's just awful.", "He is.", "ESH. Plenty of people operate the way your husband does and it is difficult for some people to switch around when they do tasks. Have you talked to him about why he feels like he can't do dishes after dinner but before bed ?\n\nYou can scream it's easy just fix it into the wind all night long but it's clearly not doing anything. \n\nIf you really think he's doing this to be annoying and disrupt your sleep then why do you wanna be with him.", "Doing more during the day would likely help his insomnia. He needs both mental and physical stimulation throughout the day, not just sitting around until something comes up he can help out with. \n\nAnd I would like to add that his actions are, in fact, selfish and inconsiderate. You have spoken to him before about how his nighttime activity impacts your sleep. And yet he still makes noise and wakes everyone up. There are many activities he could do at night that are quiet and unobtrusive. This is a choice on his part.", "Wait, he's not watching the newborn while you are working?", "Sounds like he's a night owl but that doesn't mean you're NTA and that he's TA. A good relationship needs compromise. OP doesn't say so but it looks like he's a SAHD and OP is financially supporting the family. It's not unreasonable to expect husband to take that into consideration when doing the cleaning.", "Maybe you should go to a therapist on your own to talk about the situation and develop strategies for dealing with it.", "NTA, but this is classic ADHD behavior, which could help you both understand better what\u2019s going on. One thing I\u2019ve done is put a reminder in my phone about the dishes at an earlier time.", "NTA. He is being really inconsiderate of you and the baby, by choosing to do the house work during times that will stop you from sleeping. You should be sleeping in earplugs, so you can sleep uninterrupted. The baby is another matter. He is not being helpful, he is being dense, inconsiderate,  and manipulative. Getting you a cup of tea to drink is a nice helpful gesture. Doing it while you're asleep, waking you up to give it to you, and expecting you to appreciate it is ridiculous. Does he have time during the day or on weekends to do this work? Should he have the baby out there with him, so he deals with her interrupted sleep?", "NTA but it sounds like your husband may have some sort of issues he needs professional help on.  I'm not being nasty I'm hearing he is up in the middle of the night , when most people sleep, cleaning the house to be spotless. That sounds kind of OCD.", "ESH. Both of you need to grow up.", "NTA", "NTA, though I don't think your husband is trying to be either.\n\nI do stuff like that. I have ADHD, am very nocturnal (even though I work days), and often find I can only focus or find the motivation to be productive when it comes to self-directed tasks like cleaning during the night, after my SO goes to bed. I don't know why, but I've been like that since I was a kid, and it's not something I've been able to change despite trying. I wrote all my papers for university in the middle of the night, I clean in the middle of the night, I do my taxes in the middle of the night. It sucks when I have to work early, but its that or just not get anything done sometimes. I can do a bit during the day or evening, but I'm at maybe 1/3 of my 2 am capacity. If your husband is like me I get why he isn't just doing the obvious and not doing things at night.\n\nThe obvious solution here is to train the dogs not to bark at night, and for him to at least stick to the less noisy tasks that need doing. If there is a specific noisy thing, like the dishes he can't seem to get done until nighttime maybe trade him for a quieter task, you do the dishes at a reasonable hour, he does something else like folding laundry that won't wake everyone up at night.", "Info: have you considered he might be on drugs?  This sounds like meth behavior.", "You're both the assholes.", "I'm a nightowl with ADHD. Nighttime can be a time of hyperfocus for me. BUT I do not have a child.", "Or meth.", "Yeah, it\u2019s odd not to take those steps. White noise machines, extra padding for the doors that are loud, deciding which tasks are loudest and avoiding those\u2014 this seems like obvious first steps. And, keeping the dogs out of the bedroom so the don\u2019t disturb OP is a no brainer.", "Aren't the dogs doing what they're supposed to do? You hear loud noise at night you wake up. Like I would be mad if someone tried to break into my house at night and my dog slept through the whole thing.", "Thanks, I acknowledge I can be a bit of a crazy person when I\u2019m startled awake in the middle of the night. I said things I wouldn\u2019t say during the day under normal circiumatances.", "I've scrolled this thread and don't see an answer to the questions of when he sleeps.", "Thanks, I actually do know I can be a jerk too.", "I honestly don't blame you.

I know I never got much deep sleep when my kids were small.  Always ready for them to wake or even breathe different.  Lol.  NTA and he is being inconsiderate.  You\u2019ve asked him to respect your sleeping and he isn\u2019t.", "I agree. I don't think he needs to necessarily give up late night cleaning but there's no reason not to split the jobs so that the noisy ones get done during daylight hours.", "nta ... tell him if he wakes the baby up its HIS responsibility", "INFO: \nWhat has been done to mitigate the noise? Dogs sleeping elsewhere? White noise? Insulation? \n\nThis people have different sleep schedules. He is obviously a night person. So you both compromise on what works for you both.

Hopefully he will start behaving better.", "So your husband obviously has some sort of OCD or mental issue over cleaning and you're mad at him? Y'all need therapy.", "so....I guess I'm the only person curious about why you sleep with your kid and dogs instead of with your husband.  Why don't you put the dogs out of the bedroom if they tend to startle and bark at the rattle of crockery?\n\nIf you are running the business all by yourself and your husband is sitting around eating bon-bons all day, who looks after the kid?  \n\nWhat does doing the dishes have to do with him going to the garage?

He IS being an AH.\n\nBut that being said, I had an ex who when it came to be nighttime, would stay away with his anxiety and watch ESPN/Sportcenter all night until he was physically too tired to keep his eyes open (sometimes this was days).

I am most definitely not. One night, my husband woke up around 2 in the morning ish, and had to use the bathroom. He left the door connected to our bathroom wide open, turned the light on, and peed. Why oh why is men\u2019s pee so much louder/longer than womens?? So after he finished everything, he came back into our room and turned the light on, to find some lotion because his hands were dry. I sat up in bed and stared at him, and he so sincerely confused asked \u201cwhy are you up?\u201d \n\nWHY WAS I UP??\n\nHe was honestly shocked I woke up to everything. I was so annoyed, had a hard time falling back asleep, and woke up just as annoyed the next morning.", "When he goes to sleep run the vacuum around his bed over and over.", "NTA\n\nWaking a baby and your partner in the middle of the night to clean is SO RUDE and inconsiderate. Unless he has an excuse for why he can\u2019t do things during the day (a long work shift or something) then he is only thinking about himself.", "He sounds nutty. Who cleans in the night and wakes people up? That sounds like someone on drugs or who needs to be on medicine. Odd behavior. It is not kind for him to clean and wake others. Untreated bipolar disease or substance use comes to mind. Sorry you have to deal with this.", "Wut.   This is not normal.   Definitely NTA.", "They should be able to understand the difference between you in the kitchen and someone breaking in. If this was a one-time thing, that's understandable. But the husband is in the kitchen most nights and they always bark. That's a problem. They need to train their dogs to distinguish when to alert them or not. Imagine your dogs barking every time you get up to use the restroom at night. That would get annoying.", "Might I suggest you do start vacuuming when he\u2019s asleep? \n\nNTA\n\n* I know I am petty do not take my advice", "Time to start making LOUD noises during the day, when baby is awake and he is sleeping.  Vacuum,  music, bang doors.\n\nHe either starts adjusting his schedule to be more considerate of his family or he gets a massive dose of his own medicine. NTA", "You're not giving the full story. I really doubt your husband does \"nothing\" all day, but then has the drive and motivation to clean like crazy at 3am.", "NTA. \nSummer of 2020 I was the only person in the house working and my dad would loudly put away the dishes after midnight and make it difficult to fall asleep or even wake me up. It's really rude when people don't respect others sleeping.", "Need more information. What does he do during the day? What are his working hours?", "NTA, he is behaving in a wildly erratic way. When does he sleep?\n\nDisturbing the sleep of a BABY and her mother deliberately is really odd behaviour no matter what he's doing.\n\nI would seriously question his mental health at this point, if he is obsessively cleaning in the middle of the night even though he has been told the effect it has on his family.", "Wow NTA \n\nSo he doesn\u2019t do\u2026anything all day but happily interrupts your sleep? And you have a newborn. Who is doing the night feedings? Yikes. He\u2019s being selfish.\n\nAlso if that baby is new, you are still physically recovering. Even if you feel normal the demands on your body right now are still significant.", "NTA but what's good for the goose is good for the gander start doing loud banging chores and wake him up and do not apologize for it not like he's looking after a baby or providing for his family so him getting broken sleep doesn't matter", "NTA but, if he is a night owl, but you want him to work during the day, lower the expectations for the amount of work done.", "LMAO", "No OP does the cooking. Boil his head.", "I'm ADHD and this behavior kinda reminds me of when I can't do nothing all day even when I really want to and suddenly get the zoomies around midnight or in the middle of the night.\n\nWould be worth it for Mr. Husband to check if there's something going on there.", "yeah. I am a night owl and I wouldn't be happy if I was banned from going in the garage. It isn't like he was hanging pictures or using loud equipment, it sounds like he simply tried to go into the garage and the dogs freaked out. If I can't move freely in my own home (or leave my home) during specific hours, i'll be cranky about that.\n\nBut there is a newborn baby so I think everyone does need to be extremely careful about not waking the baby or anybody else in the house, I assume they are all somewhat sleep deprived right now. So maybe with the baby it is reasonable to not go in the garage?\n\nI would be trying to find ways to keep them from waking up. Maybe the dogs wouldn't get spooked if they slept outside the bedroom? And maybe white noise? \n\nThe husband should try to do noisy chores while everyone is awake though. seems like basic courtesy.", "Nothing like ADHD choosing the worst times to be like \"Okay you can finally do the thing\"", "Sooo, to recap YOU are raising OUR child,  YOU are running OUR business,  and YOU are cooking all of OUR meals and all he has to do is clean during the day..... and he's mad about that??\n\nNTA. If the position is open, I'll come cook and clean during whatever hours you want AND get up with the baby at night if you're going to run this business and pay the bills. Just saying... it sounds like a good deal to me.", "NTA except for your home. You need a place with a bedroom far from the common areas; upstairs, for example, with the common area being downstairs. That way you can each have a place to retreat, and it still works for everyone.", "Info: why is he even awake at the wee hours of the morning? Have you considered this could be a symptom of something bigger? Like bipolar disorder? \n\nHonest question", "NTA", "nta, its not an unreasonable request.", "INFO: Who is doing nighttime feedings for the newborn?", "YTA, your husband should absolutely be able to move about the house and garage at any hour.  You don't have a husband problem, you have dog problem. If the dogs making noise is a problem, figure out a new place for them outside of your bedroom.", "Depends... Sure, if your husband is using power tools or vacuuming after midnight, then NTA. If your husband is just like wiping down counters and dusting or something, then get a fan to drown out the noise and move on.", "He knows he routinely interrupts your sleep and he's doing nothing. In fact, he's digging in his heels and doubling down. This is borderline abusive behavior but it sounds like your husband has an undiagnosed mental illness", "ESH  \nhave you ever sat down with him and tried to find out why he\u2019s more productive at 3am vs 3p.\n\n  \nim more productive at 12a because I have chronic health issues and my pain levels tend to be the lowest since my stress are also lower. At 12p I\u2019m battling my 3 year old over a nap since I happen to be a sahp.\n\nalso he\u2019s not helping with your daughter, he\u2019s parenting. I\u2019d be interested in knowing what this looks like.", "NTA. Wake him in the AM and keep him up. Why does he not help with baby or your business?", "Or adhd", "She sleeps through the night now (she\u2019s 8months) but I don\u2019t as up with her when she was waking during the night.", "This is a very crucial bit of information. NTA. Since he has all day, there\u2019s no reason to disturb you. My ex who came home at 1 or 2 a.m. never once woke me up. He could have turned the tv or radio on to unwind, but he never did to my knowledge. Neither me nor our newborn was ever awoke by him. House cleaning needs to be done during normal hours since there\u2019s plenty pf time. Sounds like a recipe for couples counseling!", "NTA you and the baby need regular sleep. \n\nI made the dogs stay out of the room until my husband came to bed when my daughter was still roomsharing with the baby.", "But you can still choose to do The Thing silently if it\u2019s 3am and other people are sleeping. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much my adhd has me awake & functional in the middle of the night - I will choose something that doesn\u2019t wake other people.", "NTA", "NTA! Your husband should really read these responses. Sleep deprivation is real and can make you sick and crazy!", "NTA. Ummm....does he have a job? If not, does he take care of the baby while you work? What in the hell does he do during the day?!", "Question:  Why are you texting your husband when you are in the same house?  I would have  been in his face in less than 30 seconds so he knew just exactly how angry I was right in that moment.   By texting, you are putting more degrees of separation between the two of you, allowing him to downplay what has happened and how it affects you.  It also allows him to not acknowledge the impact his actions have because - after all - you didn't even get out of bed.", "NTA- if he has nothing to do during the day, then he is being an asshole.", "ummm does your husband have a mental health condition? for example a type of bipolar? I only ask because I know of a couple of individuals that have done similar to this.  \n\n\nNB: I am not diagnosing.  \n\n\nyou are NTA", "NTA. This is a big communication issue. He feels like he's doing all this work and not getting enough validation, so any criticism makes him defensive. You feel like you're being clear about what you need and you're being ignored. My spouse is a lot like your husband in terms of reacting poorly to perceived criticism, and couples therapy helped us so much. You aren't TA, but try to find a neutral time to talk to your husband and start with the positives, like you did here, before moving on to the ask. I hope he can get it together and you can get some sleep!", "What happened to video games (with headphones, of course)?", "Let me say first a totally agree with you on the texting. It\u2019s indeed the root of many communication breakdowns.\n\nIn this case, I was in the bedroom under the covers and he was going out to the garage, away from the bedroom and honestly I wanted to try to go back to sleep as fast as I could. \n\nAlso, I intentionally tried to keep separate at that point because I knew if I went to him It would lead to more conflict, not less. So the aim was to inform but not escalate. \n\nHope that\u2019s helps."]}
