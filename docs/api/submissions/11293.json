Okay well now I\u2019m madder than I was before and tell him he\u2019s a selfish Inconsiderate asshole. I might be the asshole because at this point I keep going and am really furious because this has happened so many times without any adjustment. He calls me crazy and tells me how horrible I treat him. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m reacting like any normal person would, exasperated and being repeatedly ignored on the most basic consideration to minimize disruption, and he feels I\u2019m unappreciative and rude.\n\nSo who\u2019s the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1677765028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g39ex/aita_for_being_furious_at_my_husband_who_wants_to/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also: does he have any compulsive disorder or similar that makes him wander around at 3 AM looking for tasks to do?\n\nI was ready to go NTA until your reaction went nuclear, so now I want to know whether you've put this all on him to suspend his own insomnia or compulsions or whatever, or whether the two of you are cooperating towards solutions that address the real problem.", "NTA. Has your husband considered seeing a therapist about his issues?", "NTA \n\nSleep is also Essential for your newborn, not just you, so if the baby sleeps (mostly) at night it should be reasonably quiet at night, especially if you have reactive/anxious dogs. I feel like screaming/talking while angry wasn't the best move, but considering you were exhausted and had just been awoken by startled dogs and a baby that's understandable. I see in the comments that your husband had a bad experience in therapy, and I understand that, but he needs to find a way to convey his reasoning, and I think that you two should have that conversation after calming down a bit.\n\nThere's also something else to consider. You said he was going to the garage to work, What does your husband do for work? Does be contribute to the business or work an outside job? Is he a House-Spouse? Does he sleep during the day or night or perhaps the dusk-dawn hours? Does he expect quiet when he sleeps? Does he help calm your daughter down when his noise wakes her or are you expected to do that yourself with no help from him?", "ESH, he for ignoring your request, you based on your response. It also sounds like you both haven't trained your dogs well if they are the cause of you waking up. Maybe instead of him changing his schedule, he can have the dogs with him while he cleans so they don't bark.", "NTA, is he neurodivergent perchance? I literally only ask as I was recently diagnosed with autism in my 30\u2019s and I\u2019ve had behaviors like only being able to clean my kitchen after my husband goes to bed. Thankfully our bedroom is far away from the kitchen so it\u2019s never been an issue. It just stood out to me that he loves organizing and cleaning but at certain times. \n\nEither way, what he\u2019s doing is AH behavior, whether he realizes it or not. It\u2019s strange he keeps doing it though after you\u2019ve explained how distressing it is for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You and your baby need sleep. If he's unable to sleep when you do, perhaps he can find quieter ways of cleaning/organizing, like focusing on rooms that aren't right near where you are sleeping.", "Info \u2014 what does your husband do during the day?", "NTA. He is burning daylight hours doing nothing and then insists on doing chores in the middle of the night. He should be sleeping like you and the baby are, or at least like you and the baby are trying to. He is being inconsiderate. \n\nI.N.F.O. What is he doing during normal waking hours that prevents him from doing these things at that time? Like, is he so overwhelmed with daily tasks that he isn't finished with them by 3 AM?", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't need to be working in the garage at 3 AM and waking up your family. Does he have a mental issue that prevents him from sleeping?\n\nHonestly, sounds like a bipolar or manic phase.", "NTA. While it's awesome that your husband wants to clean, since his cleaning at night wakes you up, he should have realized by now that he simply can't clean at night. He needs to do it during waking hours, as you have requested.", "ESH. Your reaction and calling him a selfish inconsiderate asshole---that's not the way to treat a partner. He could obviously make an adjustment to dish-time. But it seems like you're not addressing the real issue of \"why isn't he on a similar schedule as you.\"\n\nIf he's doing stuff at 3am, then why is that? Is he just a night owl? Is he ever getting into bed with you, does he get up at 7 as well? Does he work a weird shift? Is he sleeping all day or doing something else that means he's unproductive at that time? Is he cleaning as a compulsion?", "NTA. His response to you asking he not do this disruptive activity during your core sleeping hours is not good:\"I'm doing this for us.\" Is bonkers. If he really thinks this is helpful to you, the baby, and him, he needs to get back into therapy stat. You specifically asked he not do this during the time you absolutely need to recharge and he keeps doing it over your objections. So now you are sleep deprived, the baby is fine, and the dog is rewarded for making noise with attention from all of y'all. \n\nYou are going crazy with no sleep. He is preventing you from sleeping, your reaction (while rude) is understandable. If he absolutely needs to clean he do it during the day. If he's got insomnia or disordered sleep, then he needs a doctor. And he definitely needs a therapist. When is he sleeping? If he not sleeping either, y'all need some big help in the home.", "INFO: Is there a bedroom further away from the garage and kitchen? \n\nWhat kind of work does your husband do in the garage? Is it relating to his job/business? Have you done anything to lessen the noise or perhaps have white noise on? \n\nHave you tried training the dogs to recognize the normal household sounds and not bark? It takes a lot of work but it can be done. \n\nI ask these questions because as a night person living with a morning person, we have our bedroom in the room that is as far away as possible from our front door, kitchen, and office. \nWe have white noise going in our bedroom when we\u2019re sleeping. Our dog is trained not to bark at normal household noises or when we leave the house. \n\nEach of us works better at certain times and that\u2019s not always something easy to change. We have different schedules. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole here, except maybe in the way you both discuss it and try to solve the problem. \n\nI remember when my kids were babies and it was rough. It\u2019s easy to get upset when you aren\u2019t getting enough sleep.", "NAH. Sounds like you're both struggling with your kid and with everything that's going on. You're not the asshole for being mad about this, your husband isn't the asshole for having insomnia and trying to do something productive instead. It's extremely obvious that he's not, like setting an alarm to wake up at 3 am to do this. \n\nThe two of you should get some couples therapy to figure out a better way to deal with this than fighting, though. It's clear that this situation (new parents + insomnia) is being handled really badly by both of you and is causing a huge amount of what should be avoidable tension.\n\nI want to throw out that as someone who grew up around this, the other option is for your husband to just like... grab an ipad and sit in the bathroom reading or something. If that's where you two shake out that's probably fine, but that's going to make his insomnia worse and end up with him not putting the same effort into the two of you. \n\nI'd see what you can to to get him to look for a medical solution.", "NTA for being furious.  You just had a baby and need your sleep.  The baby needs to sleep.  Yes, he is an inconsiderate AH.", "NTA, wow, waking up a newborn and Mom, it\u2019s not on. I\u2019m super glad he\u2019s doing such a good job of cleaning but middle of the night?", "NTA- I think the communication could use some help though. Have a sit down with him when you\u2019re both calm and ask why he feels like the night time is better to clean and why it\u2019s a challenge to respect your request. You can also share why it\u2019s a hardship and figure out what the barrier is for him cleaning during the day.", "NTA. Nighttime is for sleeping, especially with a baby. It\u2019s not for loud chores and reorganizing the house while everyone sleeps. It\u2019s nice he\u2019s doing those things, and it does better your home, but is he aware that same kitchen exists before 12am?", "Thank you, we have done a lot of therapy. Unfortunately he had a bad experience and it\u2019s been off the table. But we are exploring other avenues.", "True, not gonna lie was mad and rude.", "Sometimes he has appointments but our business isn\u2019t that busy, most days he has free time and helping with our daughter", "No tasks, most of the time his day is free to be spent as he wishes.", "The *right* therapist makes all the difference in the world.", "Does he sleep ever? Has he always done this? \n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA here but it sounds like something else is going on because this is not typical or normal behavior. Obviously, arguing in the middle of the night is not helpful nor a practical solution to this problem. I would be madder than a hornet if anyone but my kids were waking me up at 3 am.... to clean!! Why is he choosing to do this & how are you stressing him out by requesting he go to bed? \n\nSorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Hopefully y\u2019all can find a solution soon & get some sleep!", "Then I'm inclined to say he is being an asshole. Not only to you and the baby but to himself. These things can be done during normal daylight hours. There is no reason to be up in the middle of the night doing household chores. He should be sleeping!"]}
