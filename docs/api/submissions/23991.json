But women who are groomed by much older men in power positions over them in their mid-teens can still be in thrall to their predators a few years later.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nA 27 year old substitute teacher starts a \u201crelationship\u201d with a 16 yr old student.\n\nYour sister was groomed, raped and exploited under the guise of \u201ctrue love\u201d.\n\nThis is a very sad and complex situation. Your family will definitely be angry that this ever happened and that your sister is now trapped and tied to this criminal man because of a baby.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t come to her senses, all you can really do is let her know you\u2019re there if/when she does come to her senses and wants a way out. Now she is an adult and her decisions are her own.", "I can\u2019t get over the fact that he called you a \u201cjealous OLD hag\u201d \ud83d\ude02 \n\nYeah, this whole thing is creepy AF. NTA", "I didn\u2019t need to read past the 33 year old dating a teenager. But then I got to him being her sub and knocking her up, and I feel icky and you\u2019re not the asshole. If a 33 year old man looked me in the face and told me I didn\u2019t understand true love while he fucked a TEENAGER, honestly I\u2019d just tie him to the railroad tracks", "NTA \n\nIf he was a substitute teacher report him.  Report him everywhere you can.  That \"person\" should not be allowed anywhere near children.  Their story is not a meet-cute, it's a story of grooming and abuse. \n\nOnce you have reported him reach out to your sister and tell her even if you don't agree with the relationship you will be there for her.  Do not let him cut you or your family or if her life if you can help it at all.  She will need you when he moves on the the next young thing.", "NTA.\n\nHe groomed her into this relationship since she was a child.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I'm all for being diplomatic and trying the carrot before the stick, you're also entitled to voice your opinion to people you care about. You did the right thing and pulled her aside, he butted in and fired the first shots, if you're out of line, he's worse for calling you a \"hag\" unprovoked.\n\nAs for him, age is a number .... after a certain point. My partner is 8 years younger than me, but we met when they were 28, we were at very similar points of life with little experience left to seperate us. Your sister's BF has literally groomed her; were he in certain parts of the world, he would be facing charges. Manipulating a child into a romantic relationship before they're legally able to think for themselves is not the same as two adults meeting for the first time. I'd have called him a lot worse that \"disgusting\".", "NTA and I hate to be that person but I\u2019d report him whether my sister wants me to or not. He GROOMED her whether her and her friends think so or not. You dod the right thing by addressing it then and there.

I know how it sounds.

The amount of red flags here, its like a beach party.", "Nta. Yep you\u2019re an old hag at 22. Imagine how quick your sister is going to age out for him. Bloody feral pig that he is", "NTA but she will not listen. She has been groomed for years and is now pregnant, which means she'll be in complete denial and react angrily to reason.\n\nOf course it's wrong, she was a litteral child and he was in a position of authority, and SHE KNOWS (otherwise she would have introduced him years ago). \n\nThere is really nothing you can do apart from apologising and letting her know you are here for her and will respect her relationship. She'll hopefully know it means you'll be there for her if it goes wrong too.", "NTA\u2026.he\u2019s a ephebophilia and their relationship doesn\u2019t even fall under Romeo and Juliet laws\u2026.this guy is gross and if he is abusive he will isolate your sister and with a baby at home that makes it even easier. This man has over a decade of time more than your sister to have built up tactics of control and abuse your sister isn\u2019t even old enough to recognize and acknowledge. She is also young enough to believe love will overcome all obstacles, which most of the time is abuse.\n\nThe only thing you can do is try to maintain a communication line of knowing she has somewhere safe to go when shit gets bad. Because until she is strong enough to overcome all the abuse she won\u2019t be able to leave and stay away.\n\nI would highly suggest speaking to a counselor or reading up about large age gap abusive and controlling relationships and learn how to positively communicate with your sister in a way that establishes healthy boundaries for you but also knowing you\u2019re still there for her.\n\nIm sorry you have to try and navigate this really hard situation.", "NTA. Though I do agree it would be better saying it in a more private place. \n\nThe teacher student thing makes it all the worse. It was a serious violation of trust.", "Nta, someday she'll see your point. But you would be a bad sister to just go along with it", "Nta She already knows it's wrong that's why she waited so long to introduce yall and lied about his age it's a cannon event u can't interfere", "NTA and if he's still a teacher can you report him?

I wouldn't want someone like that teaching my kids.", "NTA. 33 and 19 is creepy if that's where the relationship starts.\n\n30 and 16 (assuming they're actually telling the truth) is predatory / grooming and should be investigated by the proper authorities.", "You need to discuss this with your parents.

When she comes to you for help, listen and don't say \" I told you so'", "NTA.  He is a predator.  I'd report him to the school and to anyone else who will listen.\n\nIn the meantime, try to reconcile with your sister if you can.  She's going to need you to get through this.", "NTA but you need to make it clear to your sister that you love her and are there for her, because he is absolutely trying to isolate her from you.", "Your sister has/was/is in an abusive relationship.

I strongly suggest talking to a lawyer about the statute of limitations on statutory rape and abuse of power rape in your state and report him to the school board.\n\nI'd wager her pregnancy is what made them finally introduce him, but it will end up being something he uses to manipulate her in the future \n\nNo matter how you confronted her or her assailant, she believes he loves her and that's all she cares about. You could provide evidence for days that he is a criminal and a predator (you don't accidently date a teenager when you are her teacher, no \"she told me she was 18\" bullshit) and she will believe that she was just so so special (hes not a pervert, i looked like an adult) and their love is so pure (he risked his job he loved me so much)\n\nYou may lose her over this, but she will come back, and my advice is to welcome her back when he breaks her heart.

She needs to alert the school distract asap.", "Age don\u2019t matter to men.  My ex was 62 and cheated w a 24 year old.  Now that\u2019s gross.", "Sister will be an \u201dold hag\u201d once that baby is born.  Watch.  This dude needs to be put away.", "Hope the baby isn\u2019t a girl.", "Yeah, exactly this. She needs to feel like she can ask for help. That she feels they are there for her without judgment. If she feels they are judging her she probably wont ask for help.
