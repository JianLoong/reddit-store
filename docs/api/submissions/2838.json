It's a sad situation, but there didn't seem to be a third choice.  You either send her to boarding school or let her ruin her life.  It's obvious that you had to do what you did ... send her to boarding school.", "NTA. You are trying to protect your child from making bad decisions. Kids sometimes end up hanging out with the wrong people. Happens to most kids.", "NTA, There are no good solutions to this issue.  At least at the boarding school she's in a more controlled environment with much less opportunity for doing these things. \n\nIf she was younger I'd advice you to move if feasible.  Might still be a good idea if you expect she will continue to live with you for the next several years.", "NTA in this case you have to do what you can do while you still can.", "A 17 year old shouldn\u2019t be hanging out with anyone who isn\u2019t a relative/family friend etc over the age of 19. 20 tops. \n\nI think sending her away is fair enough if you tried everything. You\u2019re stopping her from potentially being sent to prison. \n\nNTA.", "Ouff. That's hard. I've 0 experience with boarding school stuff, I don't even know anyone that has gone to one. It does sound like you're trying to do your best for her. I'm not gonna judge.. I just wanna wish you the best of luck.", "INFO: What was her earlier life like? What is your parenting like?\n\nWhy was she so easily taken in by these other people?   How did she get to know them?", "NTA. I am a 20yo and almost never had any problems with my parents or drugs. And also my view on this might not agree with others but I still hope it helps you!\n\nYour daughter sounded very impressive: good grades, good behavior, ...\n\nAs a parent, it is in the best interest to do the right thing for their kid. And in my opinion, sending her back to boarding school is the right thing.\n\nShe supposedly hung out with kids that took drugs, doing bad stuff and having problems with the cops. That is not what a parent likes to see.\nSeems like a path, sending her into a dark future.\n\nIf she is not going to the therapy sessions, ..., whilst doing nothing to get her on a good path again, the only option is the thing you did.\n\nYou only have to hope, that she'll appreciate this in the future if she gets better again. \nBecause this plan can also take a bad turn of events. I've seen a lot of stories on here, where this was a deal breaker in the relationship.\nPlease be careful and think this one through.\nYou'll know what's best for your daughter!\n\nI hope this has helped you and stay healthy and safe.\n\n(Edit: you would be YTA if you oversold the actions of your daughter. Kids are not perfect in every way. They sometimes do shitty things, sometimes don't study for things and sometimes don't get good grades. \nAs you said, if she gets more aggressive and so on, becoming a problem for herself and yourself, then I'm going to agree with you.\nIf she only got a bit worse in school because she hung out with her friends and had an incident once, then you are overreacting.\nLike I said, please think this one through)", "Alright, you\u2019re TA but I gotta get this out of the way first. Kids are not perfect, they\u2019re people who have peer related pressures and want to fit into their surroundings and appear accepted. God knows a lot of adults can\u2019t seem to shake that same feeling. That being said your approach is harsh as hell, you literally are avoiding asking her what\u2019s wrong or what you can do to help. Dragging her off to therapists or locking her away in boarding without her wanting any of it just seems to me you\u2019ve skipped an entire conversation about what she\u2019s going thru. It can\u2019t all be about grades and behaviour they\u2019re not robots. You just seem to fixing the issue rather than solving it. Talk to your kid, ask her what\u2019s wrong. Offer solutions that don\u2019t include boarding school if you ever want to see her after university again.", "NTA Better boarding school than her ending up dead.   How many teens have died from overdosing? You trying to keep her alive.", "NTA. What a tough situation. I hope everything works out for your daughter.", "YTA. You're sending her away seems less about it being for her own good and more about it being easier for you.", "INFO: What kind of boarding school is it? And how strict were you with her when she was growing up?", "YTA. She\u2019s old enough to make her own decisions on her education and this particular behavioral intervention obviously didn\u2019t work last time.", "Yup", "NTA", "NTA. Minus the drugs, I was that daughter. 1 Yr away from parents and surrounded by structure and I was able to make better sensible choices. \nHope it works for your daughter,  well done xx", "THIS!!! There\u2019s a huge difference between the two and the difference can even be life or death. The \u201cproblem kid\u201d programs are absolutely horrific. I really hope it\u2019s an accredited, state inspected, boarding school.", "This.  A regular school is probably fine,  but those \"problem\" children ones are abusive shitholes and any parent who willingly sends their child to one is a huge asshole.", "Good point... please answer OP", "I have a friend who went to a regular boarding school. He still got abused by the other students there. I'm not sure there are many \"good\" boarding schools."]}
