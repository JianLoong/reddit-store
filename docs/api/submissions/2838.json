It's a sad situation, but there didn't seem to be a third choice.  You either send her to boarding school or let her ruin her life.  It's obvious that you had to do what you did ... send her to boarding school.", "NTA. You are trying to protect your child from making bad decisions. Kids sometimes end up hanging out with the wrong people. Happens to most kids.", "NTA, There are no good solutions to this issue.  At least at the boarding school she's in a more controlled environment with much less opportunity for doing these things. \n\nIf she was younger I'd advice you to move if feasible.  Might still be a good idea if you expect she will continue to live with you for the next several years.", "NTA in this case you have to do what you can do while you still can.", "A 17 year old shouldn\u2019t be hanging out with anyone who isn\u2019t a relative/family friend etc over the age of 19. 20 tops. \n\nI think sending her away is fair enough if you tried everything. You\u2019re stopping her from potentially being sent to prison. \n\nNTA.", "Ouff. That's hard. I've 0 experience with boarding school stuff, I don't even know anyone that has gone to one. It does sound like you're trying to do your best for her. I'm not gonna judge.. I just wanna wish you the best of luck.", "INFO: What was her earlier life like? What is your parenting like?\n\nWhy was she so easily taken in by these other people?   How did she get to know them?", "NTA. I am a 20yo and almost never had any problems with my parents or drugs. And also my view on this might not agree with others but I still hope it helps you!\n\nYour daughter sounded very impressive: good grades, good behavior, ...\n\nAs a parent, it is in the best interest to do the right thing for their kid. And in my opinion, sending her back to boarding school is the right thing.\n\nShe supposedly hung out with kids that took drugs, doing bad stuff and having problems with the cops. That is not what a parent likes to see.\nSeems like a path, sending her into a dark future.\n\nIf she is not going to the therapy sessions, ..., whilst doing nothing to get her on a good path again, the only option is the thing you did.\n\nYou only have to hope, that she'll appreciate this in the future if she gets better again. \nBecause this plan can also take a bad turn of events. I've seen a lot of stories on here, where this was a deal breaker in the relationship.\nPlease be careful and think this one through.\nYou'll know what's best for your daughter!\n\nI hope this has helped you and stay healthy and safe.\n\n(Edit: you would be YTA if you oversold the actions of your daughter. Kids are not perfect in every way. They sometimes do shitty things, sometimes don't study for things and sometimes don't get good grades. \nAs you said, if she gets more aggressive and so on, becoming a problem for herself and yourself, then I'm going to agree with you.\nIf she only got a bit worse in school because she hung out with her friends and had an incident once, then you are overreacting.\nLike I said, please think this one through)", "Alright, you\u2019re TA but I gotta get this out of the way first. Kids are not perfect, they\u2019re people who have peer related pressures and want to fit into their surroundings and appear accepted. God knows a lot of adults can\u2019t seem to shake that same feeling. That being said your approach is harsh as hell, you literally are avoiding asking her what\u2019s wrong or what you can do to help. Dragging her off to therapists or locking her away in boarding without her wanting any of it just seems to me you\u2019ve skipped an entire conversation about what she\u2019s going thru. It can\u2019t all be about grades and behaviour they\u2019re not robots. You just seem to fixing the issue rather than solving it. Talk to your kid, ask her what\u2019s wrong. Offer solutions that don\u2019t include boarding school if you ever want to see her after university again.", "NTA Better boarding school than her ending up dead.   How many teens have died from overdosing? You trying to keep her alive.", "NTA. What a tough situation. I hope everything works out for your daughter.", "YTA. You're sending her away seems less about it being for her own good and more about it being easier for you.", "INFO: What kind of boarding school is it? And how strict were you with her when she was growing up?", "YTA.

There\u2019s a huge difference between the two and the difference can even be life or death. The \u201cproblem kid\u201d programs are absolutely horrific.

A regular school is probably fine,  but those \"problem\" children ones are abusive shitholes and any parent who willingly sends their child to one is a huge asshole.", "Good point... please answer OP", "I have a friend who went to a regular boarding school. He still got abused by the other students there. I'm not sure there are many \"good\" boarding schools.", "INFO:  what kind of boarding school ?

No. \n\nYou've listed all these things that you've tried and haven't helped, but one you missed out is \"sending her to boarding school\". It's not worked to improve her behaviour/help her, so what is the purpose of sending her there?", "If this is a troubled teen program YTA", "Idk what to vote here but I\u2019d suggest you get into therapy, get some perspective. Teenagers are moody but a massive shift in behavior and friends can indicate she\u2019s had some kinda of large and emotionally jarring event. That could be why she\u2019s avoiding therapy as well. I don\u2019t want kids because they become teenagers and teenagers are terrifying in their emotional chaos. Good luck", "I'd tend towards a soft yta -if she is struggling with addiction as you suspect, is taking all her control away going to help? Where will you guys be for support? How will you monitor how she is coping? \n\nBoarding schools also have drugs, self harm, eating disorders\n\nCan't you move somewhere with her?", "NTA, but maybe you should get therapy and some advice on how to handle the situation. I can't imagine how hard this is on you and you may need support.", "Yta and I hope when you guys are older she puts you in the worst home she can find. Where nobody ever helps yiu.", "Yeah, technically you can force your kid to undergo therapy and whatnot, but in the end of the day if someone doesn't want to be helped, there's little you can do besides physically keep them away from problems. \n\n\n\nThis is above Reddit OP, you may need to talk with social workers and therapists specialized in children to get proper tools to deal with her.", "thats what I thought too. Boarding school obviously isn't helping either, but at least there she isn't OPS problem.", "NTA.  Reluctantly.  This is a bandage on a temporary situation.  Once she turns 18 you won\u2019t be able to force her to do anything.  Time to come up with Plan B.", "Because I doubt your daughter is going to Woldingham or the like, YTA. The schools that are accepting your daughter are abusive hell holes. I don\u2019t care for Paris Hilton, but watch her documentary to see how awful those places are. Since you seem to have done a terrible job raising her so far, I guess just let it roll until she\u2019s 18 when she can cut contact with you. Obviously, you don\u2019t want to live in an unsafe environment but I don\u2019t see you noting any violent or destructive behavior. You send her to that boarding school, she will come back worse than when you sent her\u2014 which you probably already noticed. Getting physically and sexually abused and knowing your parents did that to you is how you end up with really dangerous, fucked up kids.", "The way you talk about her is kinda weird. But nta", "I don't think you're an asshole, but I really don't like boarding schools. I think about how much I was guided by my parents during high school, even as an extremely independent person, and I wonder who helps those kids. Do they just advise each other? What a horrible idea. Who loves on them? Who hugs them? Who notices when they're sleeping too much? Or not enough? I realize your kid is having problems, and I can't imagine that is easy. But this doesn't sound like the answer, either. It also seems weird that you took her to rehab without actually knowing if she's an addict. It's usually really clear. Counseling maybe? Including family?", "There are way, way more than two possibilities in this situation. They could move. They could do family counseling. Etc.", "Boarding schools are also breeding grounds for sexual abuse. You have a large population of vulnerable minors in isolation and limited to zero access to trusted adults. The 24/7 access to the kids makes it much easier for abusers to act, especially as the lines are blurred in a way that is easier distinguished by day school kids. Adults coming into sleeping quarters, bathrooms, etc .", "You don\u2019t know anything about these boarding schools, lol. She isn\u2019t headed off to Woldingham/Eaton. She\u2019s being sent to a school that has probably been shut down many times before and has had to changed names to stay in business.

Primarily because you are very clearly doubling down on a style of parenting that isn't working. If boarding school didn't work last time, why do you think it will this time? My advice, treat your daughter like the adult she's on the cusp of being.", "INFO: were the drugs she was involved with just weed and alcohol? It sounds like they are if you categorize her cursing as an indicator that she\u2019s going down the \u201cwrong path.\u201d \n\nif that\u2019s the case your actions are just telling her that if you have this much of an extreme reaction to something as small (relatively in terms of underage drug abuse) as that there\u2019s no reason she shouldn\u2019t do worse things. You are raising a child who does not trust you, will not come to you when things go bad, and sees misdemeanor worthy activities as her only reprieve or fun. \n\nIf it\u2019s harder substances then put her back in rehab. Boarding school will do nothing but incentivize her to seek it out more. \n\nThat is unless it\u2019s one of those boarding schools that are basically work camps for children whose parents don\u2019t actually care what happens to them as long as they\u2019re not physically with them/near other select people. \n\nAll in all YTA.", "NTA!!!!\n\nYou sound like a very responsible parent trying your best to get your daughter back on a good path. Don't beat yourself up. She is just throwing a verbal tantrum and trying to manipulate you in any way that she can. Don't let her get any traction on you! Hang in there! The hormones during the teenage years are powerful and trigger all kinds of difficulties like these, and she doesn't yet have the brain development to understand the consequences of her bad choices. Be firm, STAND firm, and always remind her you are her parent, not her peer, that you love her ... that you want the very best life for her.\n\nWhen she is an adult, she will have a much different perspective than she has now. She might even thank you for your intervention in her life (as my own strong-willed daughter did).", "It depends on the boarding school tbh, if it didn't work the first time you should try to look into another. It's clear you've done all that you can do, and the best you can do for now is find a place that will correct her behavior but also help her and not stress her out.", "INFO - what kind of boarding school is this? I have a sneaking suspicion it's a behavioral intervention school.\n\nAlso, what does your daughter say when you talk to her about this? What does she think this means for her future and what she's going to be doing next? What does your daughter do that she likes? What did she stop doing, aside from being \"perfect,\" which is a standard no child can maintain over time.\n\nWhat was your relationship with her like before all of this started to happen?\n\nI work in child safety and honestly this post is raising so many red flags that I'm surprised and disappointed you haven't picked up on at least some of them. Something major is happening with your daughter. Some need she has is not being met in a healthy way and your job as a parent is to realize that in a year she's going to be an adult. She's going to be on her own. And it sounds like she is completely unprepared and making very poor decisions.\n\nWhat would this post look like from your daughter's point of view?", "I am in New England and all the boarding schools are college prep schools that are feeders for the ivys - so I don't see it as a problem.\n\nHowever, there are not so good boarding schools in other areas and schools that used to be called reformatories that wouldn't be such a great choice.\n\nBut, when your back is to the wall, getting the kid away from the bad seeds isn't the worst choice if you can afford it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. In no uncertain terms, you're doing the right thing and likely the only option you have left.\n\nDon't listen to anyone here who's trying to make you doubt it - they either don't have kids, or are probably like the people in your daughter's new 'crowd'.", "The type of school really makes a difference. In some places, boarding schools an actually be of a higher quality than local schools. Where I\u2019m from, kids and parents compete to get a spot in certain boarding schools", "Hope that she's outgrown it and that it was just a phase. Not much else to do when OP has already tried it seems everything else.", "Man the teens on AITA are wild.", "You obviously didn't read the post.", "I had a friend who was having troubles, and their whole family moved states. \n\nShe's late 20s now and thankful to her parents. She'd had mental health troubles and says they saved her life.", "I think this is the key question. No doubt a good boarding school can help. Yet, it estranged her parents and her even more. She'll up and leave with 18 and go through some real shitty time. I hope that her parents will open the door to her and help when she decides to turn her life around.", "Angela Lansbury moved her whole family to Ireland because it was the only way to keep her son off drugs and her daughter away from a creepy guy.
