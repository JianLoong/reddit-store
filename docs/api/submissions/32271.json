Vanity is a dumb reason to die.", "I don\u2019t feel the cold on my feet, the sort of guy who takes the trash out bare foot in the winter, I feel it everywhere else. Diabetes would be a good explanation, but nope, doctor has ruled it out (rampant in my family so I get tested every couple of years).", "It's one of those things that's only cute if done spontaneously, and extremely rarely.\n\nPlanning on taking someone else's coat is dreadful, unless you know for a fact that the other person never feels the cold.", "My brother and I have a similar thing going on with feet in the snow.  We grew up running around barefooted so we had pretty thick callouses.  My brother did run to get the mail barefoot in the snow.  He did use shoes for more extended trips outside.  That was just continuous exposure, and it was before my diabetes.  Good for you, getting tested! That's so smart.", "Yeah, when I make this mistake I do everything possible to refuse my husband\u2019s coat when he offers. It\u2019s my problem, fault, and my consequences to deal with.", "In (I think), Regency times, one expression they used to say about someone a bit dim was that they \"Had more hair than wit\".", "I just read about the GF who called the BF screaming that she was dying, and laughed when he arrived and she was fine. She was testing his abilities in an emergency. \n\nThese women who test their BFs\u2018 loyalty are unworthy of loving relationships. \n\nImagine planning to make your beloved cold layer on. \ud83d\ude44", "The Island of Conclusions is implementing immigration protocols *specifically* to keep you from jumping there anymore.", "It's true, I've had my Anne Klein winter trench for 10 years now, and I bought it used. Best $40 I ever spent! \n\nAlways do your thrift shopping where rich people live. They give away the best stuff.", "Unless you live in Sydney (Aus).\n\nThe rich area op shops are shite, but the ones with high immigration (particularly Korean) have the BEST branded clothes basically all in new condition. No idea why but if you look at an immigration map of Sydney it absolutely lines up and you should definitely thrift there. (I've snapped up so many things for $5, incl 2 pairs of what looked like brand new Nike shoes, I got a coat from an Aus brand for $10 which also looked new and would have retailed for about $200 at the time).\n\nThe rich areas are crap cheap clothes that are priced higher than they were new haha", "Years ago (like Madonna years), I used to get the ratty minks at the church sales. They would last a year or two until an arm would fall off or the back would split.\n\nOMG - they were crazy warm and super heavy though, lol!", "Ah, I live in the US, and I don't know that I'd fit into Korean sizes. I'm on the big-and-tall side."]}
