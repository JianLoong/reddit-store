His big shirt, or even his coat on a cold day.  I totally took one of his old coats that he no longer wears.  She may just like to smell you in the coat.  It can be a thing of look how much he loves me; he will go cold and give me his coat.  (I don't condone it, but it feels good when your hubby does something selfless for you).  Now, I don't of course do this on purpose, but I know some women who do.  To make her happy, you can just put an extra coat of yours in the car and when she asks for your coat, give it to her and go get your second coat.
