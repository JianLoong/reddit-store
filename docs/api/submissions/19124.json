Yet the challenge is that I don't know when the group-work is not working unless somebody tells me. In a scenario like this, I would ideally find out soon enough that I could have done something about it early in the month's timeline.... maybe even have divided the group into two groups and then notified the MIA two that they were now a pair on their own. Then if and when the slackers fail, it would have more clearly been their own \"group's\" fault without such potential for blow-back on the responsible members of the original group.

I don't recommend that method but it was still a little funny.

Bob is off his rocker if he thinks this about-face was the kindest way.\n\n>We did this on the day we turned the project in, there was no time.\n\nI'm confused. Are you saying that you and Bob actually left this project to the last minute? If you found yourselves scrambling to do all the work last-minute without the other two helping, then some of this unevenness in contribution could be your own faults. I thought from your original post that you were working on it for a month and knew for weeks that they weren't doing anything while you were working progressively on it.  In that regard, I am somewhat in agreement with the teacher \"letting the students handle things for themselves,\" since the lack of planning for mutual contribution and communciating with teacher and peers is part and parcel of students learning how to work with people (either by success or by failure). If you only very last minute worked on the project and \\*then\\* got your peers failed for not showing up at the last-minute panic work-session, then fact that they are now angry at you is perhaps a somewhat natural consequence of not planning in such a way that all could participate, even if they're also wrong for not having taken initiative to plan and do the work. I have had 'responsible' students complain that they did all the work themselves, and then admit that they didn't even invite or communicate with their peers about the work session becuase they were actually just starting to get their ducks in a row at 11 pm the night before and hadn't actually planned or communicated wtih anybody, but they feel angry at their peers for not helping... like, seriously? It doesn't sound like you guys were necessarily that bad, but I'm just saying there are a lot of ways for a group project to go un-fairly. And usually everybody is more of a slacker than they care to admit, even if some people then freak out last minute and panic-throw it together. (Hence why I rarely assign group projects. It is usually not worth my time to try to sort out who actually did what).", "I know, but I wanted to abide by what Bob wanted. He's kind to a fault and I'm one of his only friends.", ">Does Bob think it was kinder to ask for them to get 0's after-the-fact?\n\nBob is high support needs Autistic and isn't good at that sort of long term social thinking. I doubt that crossed his mind. He also legitimately believed that they were good people who just couldn't fit it in to their schedule. \n\n>I'm confused. Are you saying that you and Bob actually left this project to the last minute? \n\nAh, no. My wording was bad, sorry. What I meant is that we reported them on the day we turned it in, as by that point even Bob realized they were in fact not nice people who would come help us. We worked our asses off the whole month trying to finish the project.", "Not much you can do now mate, just learn for next time.\n\nGoogle freeloading - it\u2019s a fact of life and a great skill to manage it well.", "Yeah, then it sounds like you were in a tough position and did your best.\n\nIf you had already told the teacher they weren't doing their work early on; then the only way I think you could moreso let the chips lay where they fall is to have told Bob that,if he doesn't want to hold the others accountable for their own work, then \\*he\\* needs to be willing to make it up himself. If he was holding you back from somehow addressing all this more effectively sooner, then why did he expect you to joing him in scrambling last-minute to back-and-fill it all? But honestly, I know that kind of hardball approach  -- even if it's probably right and most fair in terms of just letting the MIA guys fail and letting the enablers bear the brunt of enabling -- is just too high stakes in school if the teacher is giving one massive grade to you all. It really only works if your teacher is differentiating sections/grades sufficiently that you can just let MIA folk just not turn in their sections and get their 0s for their missing work naturally. And it is probably also unrealistic to expect high schoolers to set boundaries in the management of it all, if they do not yet have the maturity or strength to see that sometimes the best thing to do is let others make their own bed and lie in it.\n\nI hated group projects as a student myself, and I think your teacher did not do enough to set this up and monitor all this in a way that would be fair and let natural consequences of work/non-work unfold. When I do assing group work, I always build in some way of differentiating roles and then use separate rubrics for each student -- so then it is clear that if one doesn't do the work and fails, that it is not the other group members' fault."]}
