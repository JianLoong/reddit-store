Are you saying that you and Bob actually left this project to the last minute? If you found yourselves scrambling to do all the work last-minute without the other two helping, then some of this unevenness in contribution could be your own faults. I thought from your original post that you were working on it for a month and knew for weeks that they weren't doing anything while you were working progressively on it.  In that regard, I am somewhat in agreement with the teacher \"letting the students handle things for themselves,\" since the lack of planning for mutual contribution and communciating with teacher and peers is part and parcel of students learning how to work with people (either by success or by failure). If you only very last minute worked on the project and \\*then\\* got your peers failed for not showing up at the last-minute panic work-session, then fact that they are now angry at you is perhaps a somewhat natural consequence of not planning in such a way that all could participate, even if they're also wrong for not having taken initiative to plan and do the work. I have had 'responsible' students complain that they did all the work themselves, and then admit that they didn't even invite or communicate with their peers about the work session becuase they were actually just starting to get their ducks in a row at 11 pm the night before and hadn't actually planned or communicated wtih anybody, but they feel angry at their peers for not helping... like, seriously? It doesn't sound like you guys were necessarily that bad, but I'm just saying there are a lot of ways for a group project to go un-fairly. And usually everybody is more of a slacker than they care to admit, even if some people then freak out last minute and panic-throw it together. (Hence why I rarely assign group projects. It is usually not worth my time to try to sort out who actually did what).", "I know, but I wanted to abide by what Bob wanted. He's kind to a fault and I'm one of his only friends.", ">Does Bob think it was kinder to ask for them to get 0's after-the-fact?\n\nBob is high support needs Autistic and isn't good at that sort of long term social thinking. I doubt that crossed his mind. He also legitimately believed that they were good people who just couldn't fit it in to their schedule. \n\n>I'm confused. Are you saying that you and Bob actually left this project to the last minute? \n\nAh, no. My wording was bad, sorry. What I meant is that we reported them on the day we turned it in, as by that point even Bob realized they were in fact not nice people who would come help us. We worked our asses off the whole month trying to finish the project.", "Not much you can do now mate, just learn for next time.\n\nGoogle freeloading - it\u2019s a fact of life and a great skill to manage it well.", "Yeah, then it sounds like you were in a tough position and did your best.\n\nIf you had already told the teacher they weren't doing their work early on; then the only way I think you could moreso let the chips lay where they fall is to have told Bob that,if he doesn't want to hold the others accountable for their own work, then \\*he\\* needs to be willing to make it up himself. If he was holding you back from somehow addressing all this more effectively sooner, then why did he expect you to joing him in scrambling last-minute to back-and-fill it all? But honestly, I know that kind of hardball approach  -- even if it's probably right and most fair in terms of just letting the MIA guys fail and letting the enablers bear the brunt of enabling -- is just too high stakes in school if the teacher is giving one massive grade to you all. It really only works if your teacher is differentiating sections/grades sufficiently that you can just let MIA folk just not turn in their sections and get their 0s for their missing work naturally. And it is probably also unrealistic to expect high schoolers to set boundaries in the management of it all, if they do not yet have the maturity or strength to see that sometimes the best thing to do is let others make their own bed and lie in it.\n\nI hated group projects as a student myself, and I think your teacher did not do enough to set this up and monitor all this in a way that would be fair and let natural consequences of work/non-work unfold. When I do assing group work, I always build in some way of differentiating roles and then use separate rubrics for each student -- so then it is clear that if one doesn't do the work and fails, that it is not the other group members' fault.", "NTA\n\nHigh School Teacher here, and I see this all the time.

You did awesome standing up for Bob and did so, just telling the truth. Standing ovation!", "Lulz you mean their or more like their parents' money. They'll have to retake the course if it's required and uni won't mind getting tuition for repeating a class.", "If you partner with Bob again, remind him of this. It isn\u2019t helping them for him to let them take advantage of you. They won\u2019t learn unless they do the work.", "I think it  worked better this way, if they're that mean spirited they didn't deserve to put in some half assed day of work and get credit. I prefer this outcome where they faced consequences.", "Oh my god....I can't freaking stand group projects.  College professors need to get their heads out of their butts and realize that a group project is really only completed by only 1 or 2 people in the group and the rest just ride their coat tails.  Professors think that group projects helps build camaraderie  and responsibility but it doesn't.  It never has. You are NTA", "NTA\n\n*you\u2019re in college????* man, I thought this was high school. They know better 1000%. You reap what you sew.", "NTA \u2014 if they don\u2019t know how to contribute for a group project i the final year of university, they have a bad grade coming... It\u2019s not high school anymore, can\u2019t cut corners the same way.", "NTA. \n\nAttack them back - show 'their friends' - how they came in and tried to STEAL your work, by copying and pasting it in so that it looks like they tried to add it. \n\nIf I was marking the assignment - that action would have caused me to FAIL both of those students and potentially look at academic misconduct. \n\nBut as everyone else has said - don't leave it until after the assignment do it before it's submitted. \n\nIn about 50 group projects that I did at uni - I would say there was only 1 or 2 that I ever did where it was a good team and everyone pulled their weight - I hate group assignments. \n\nOne group assignment I did - the entire class ended up on academic warning for the entire year,  it made front page news, and the university was threatened to be sued by something a classmate did.", "NTA. Bottom line is they didn't do the work and expected you to take that on the cheek. If thats a problem for them they can ask your teacher how to fix their grade.", "Uh yeah, they can go pound sand and kick rocks. Let this be a lesson to them. In the real world, if they pulled this shit, they would be fired. \n\nNTA", "You did nothing wrong. Thankfully your teacher sees that too. I had a similar situation with a college group project once, but despite the fact I kept the teacher in the loop the whole time our other teammates were slacking and showed proof, we were graded down for our teammates\u2019 poor performance on the presentation and told we could write her an essay on how we \u201ccould have handled the issues on the team better\u201d to boost our grades back up after we complained that we\u2019d told her they weren\u2019t helping. Hardest essay I ever had to write, because the only way I could\u2019ve seen to have \u201chandled it better\u201d would have been to kneecap the other three in the parking lot and tell the teacher they were sick so we could be graded on just the two of us who tried.", "Hilarious. Don't even worry about it. I can't imagine others really giving a crap.\n\nWe did this to some lazy ass that did nothing on a group project. They deserve it.", "NTA - and part of the reason for group projects is teaching people how to work together - as you will later on in your profession. So going to the teacher whinning that some partners aren't participating is not what they want to hear. They are not going to assign new partners, just like your boss isn't going to hire new co-workers. For the vast number of these group projects, peer pressure gets those under-achievers to do something, at least. And the ones that are willing to work hopefully learn about getting others to participate and how not to be taken advantage of. Those who don't learn to pull their weight get the extreme lesson your teacher gave them.", "NTA, but how big of a university is this that they could even attempt to make everyone hate you?", "NTA", "NTA, I once had a group project in college where only 11 out of the other 4 sent me anything and it was a shitty jpeg. We were supposed to build a website and there were rules for the formatting and shit and the picture placement etc. I actually got bitched at by the other 3 because they got dnc's. The other dude got like 50% and was happy about it lol", "NTA, i did this once for an online class where we had a big group project. Tried multiple times to coordinate who would do what in the project and at the end I ended up doing most of it by myself. At the end I turned it in and then sent an email to the prof with proof that I did it all myself and they did jack shit. There was only one person in the group that actually helped and while I don\u2019t want to be elitist, a lot of their things I didn\u2019t end up using or had to completely rewrite because their writing was so bad\u2014like improper spelling, using \u201ctexting\u201d language and acronyms, and just generally not college-level writing.", "Literally dealt with this a week ago, at least the guy had some decency to do the reports while me and the other guy did all the coding work, 4th dude did zero work but at least he had the guts to tell our prof he didn't work much on the project- he did nothing but attend the meeting a few times and left early lol.", "It's kind of like repeatedly parking in a no parking zone and then one day getting 20 years to life for repeated parking violations. \n\nSure, they should have just helped.  Yes they had plenty of warning.  None of this is on OP.  But it would have been great for OP if OP had gone to the teacher after a few attempts to get them involved, split OP and Bob onto their own team, and the teacher could tell the remaining two to do a separate project.  \n\nAt work I have a lot of opportunities to make people look like idiots for not being on top of stuff, but everyone has so much to juggle, that I do my best to keep them on top of stuff or find other people to work on things.  It's in no one's best interest if work doesn't get done or people freeload.", "NTA but agree with people who say it\u2019s best to bring it to the professor\u2019s attention earlier, so they are aware of the work imbalance and so they can mention it to your group members.\nI teach undergrad and have my students do 4 person group projects using version history to track participation. If the professor isn\u2019t bad at their job they should be able to point out the lack of participation in the doc rather than reveal a complaint was made about them.", "NTA. But I probably would have brought it up earlier so there was a not on file of you contacting the teacher prior to the due date. \n\nThey are seniors in uni and if they are unable to do their own assignments then they shouldn't be earning credits for it.", "NTA one bit. Twice when I was a freshman in high school, I got stuck on projects with a girl who did no work. Both times I told the teacher that I did all the work (or in one of the cases, me and another girl as there were 3 of us)", "Collaborative projects have higher value in some majors than others.  OP seems to be a computer science major, and for coding projects a mix of both solo and group work is important, as it better reflects the reality of the field.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t do anything. Why would it make sense for you and Bob to give them any credit? Lazy. They\u2019re lazy."]}
