Due to world events, her senior year was spent at home.  Things like her senior trip, spring break, and prom got cancelled.  Her school never planned a \"make up\" trip or prom for her year and instead went back to business for the class of 2021. \n\nMisty, props to her, never complained about it.  She accepted things with a sense of resignation, if that makes sense.  Regardless, I can see that it hurt her to see her brother and sister get to do the things she couldn't do.\n\nA few weeks ago, Misty reached out and asked if I can help her out with something.  Her favorite actor is going to be performing on Broadway next spring and she desperately wants to see that show.  She's in college and has a job, but needs help paying for a ticket.    \n\nShe made it clear that I didn't have to pay her if I didn't want to.  But given what happened three years ago and how she took it, I felt bad for her.  What she went through wasn't fair.\n\nSo I bought Misty a ticket for opening night.  It was expensive, yes, but frankly it was about the same amount that was spent for Ash's prom or Brock's letterman jacket and banquet.  \n\nMy husband doesn't agree.  He thinks that I'm spoiling Misty.  He doesn't see how it's fair to give our adult daughter money for a trip but not do the same for the other kids.  To him, what happened in 2020 happened in 2020 and you can't do anything to fix it.  \n\nI disagree.  Brock and Ash got to go on trips, banquets, and prom for their senior year and Misty spent hers under lockdown.  She really had nothing to commemorate senior year.  And if anything, the money I spent on her ticket came out to less than all of the senior year expenses for either of our other children.  \n\nI need an outside perspective.  AITA?

Senior trip and this concert may be apples and oranges- but so are your kids, and the circumstances of their years in high school. Instead of spending her money first then asking you for rent, she prioritized adult responsibilities and only then reached out for help getting some fun experiences she wants, deserves, and probably very much needs after a stressful transition from HS to college. Yes, 2020 is over and nothing will change that: but there's nothing wrong with telling her you're proud of how she' handled it and handing over money you'd budgeted for her HS senior expenses. Hope she enjoys the show!", "NTA why does your husband hate your daughter so much.", "NTA \n\nStand your ground. You are absolutely right about this. The fact that she accepted it all with grace make this kind of positive reinforcement even more important. Sounds like shes a tender soul (asking but not demanding, guilting or acting entitled) \n\nHubs is wrong 100%  make a spreadsheet if he needs a visual", "NTA - that's a very nice gesture you are doing for your daughter and I support it.  Since hubby is insisting on being an AH, tell him the money came out of his Christmas Present fund so he shouldn't be expecting much from you this year.  It's like the rules say, naughty kids (AH's in this case) get coal for Christmas.", "NTA - you give your kids what they need at the time. If you need to keep it \"fair\" call it an early Christmas present.\n\nYour husband keeping score, willing to deny his daughter a once in a lifetime experience, he is the asshole.", "NTA this is a lovely gesture for someone who through no fault of her own, missed out on making memories. This won't replace the lost year of 2020, but will a) give her something to treasure forever b) show her that you've got this & by the sounds of it you've raised a good 'un. Fair play to you & her. I hope Misty enjoys the show & your husband learns from it - especially if you show him these resplies.", "NTA. Your daughter got shafted because of the thing that shall not be named. She asked and you said yes, she didn't demand it. Are you spoiling your daughter? I don't think so, I see it as you doing something nice for her and giving her a memory that she will have for a lifetime.", "Nta.\n\nAlso, kudos on the pokemon character names. Made my little dork heart smile.\n\nYour daughter missed out on not just life events but core memories. Prom is an important event, not just for dressing up and spending time with friends, but is something people remember for years. Just because your husband can't understand how that made her feel doesn't mean it doesn't still upset her. It may not be a big deal to him, but to her, she had something taken away from her due to reasons beyond her control that she could not get back. 2020, in my opinion, really hurt our children who didn't get to live the full experience of their last year. Especially when it's something they look forward to so far in advance to begin with.\n\nMy son didn't even have graduation, no prom, no trips. I know it bothered him as well. We paid for a cap and gown he couldn't even walk across a stage in for his family to see his accomplishment. It was very depressing to him. He had to watch his name be read in a Zoom meeting for graduation. \n\nIt's really more upsetting that he thinks just because she has a job, you can't or shouldn't still do nice things for her. It doesn't mean you won't do things for your other children. Just because our children grow up, move on, and build their own lives doesn't mean we can't still do things for them. \n\nYou did good momma, she will remember this moment, and it will mean the world to her.", "NTA. Your husband is being ridiculous. I know Broadway theater tickets are expensive, but when you look at what you and he laid out for her siblings senior year, this is pennies on the dollar.

Good for you.", "NTA. I'm 2020 grad mom too (college undergrad). No graduation at all, we didn't even get grad pics. I get it. I also have other kids that have all different interests.

We can't give them that year back, but we can try and make the current years a little better.", "NTA. What, had your husband already spent the money on something for himself?", "NTA.  I think this was a really sweet gesture on your part that your daughter will remember with appreciation the rest of her life.  In the hindsight of years, the gift of your understanding will probably trump prom.\n\nI say this as someone whose mother wasn't very nice to her.  My few good memories involve a book she left on my bed when I was in first grade and a lavender purse when I was in sixth grade.  This is probably a girl thing.  Don't worry about your husband.  You did good, and I hope your daughter has a wonderful time. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA your husband is clueless", "NTA but like, he accepts gifts doesn't he?

As you pointed out, you spent that kind of money on fun senior stuff for your other kids that Misty didn\u2019t get to do. Misty sounds like she\u2019s been nothing but positive, and she didn\u2019t demand anything, just asked you for a favor. \n\nCurious as to what your other kids thought of the idea.", "NTA - This is really sweet. She\u2019s not demanding, she\u2019s hoping and requesting very sweetly. It also sounds like she\u2019s super responsible (which props to her because COVID learning was horrible). I think it\u2019s awesome, especially since she watched her brother do all those fun things, went through a horrible senior year and watched her sister go do the things she didn\u2019t get to go do. I mean what a great person and a good sister she is. Not the asshole at all.\n\nI see in the comments what your husband\u2019s point of view is. I agree with that to a certain point but COVID screwed everything up. It was very difficult and have you seen all these studies talking about young kids struggling with being social, older kids struggling with school (I saw a few things that said some kids are like two grade levels behind!) I mean it was incredibly difficult and the fact that your daughter was able to stay on track is huge. Again, props to her. THEN ON TOP OF ALL THAT, she watched her brother go to prom, have a real graduation ceremony, class trips, senior pranks, homecoming all of those things most kids do. Her years got messed up and THEN her sister got to go do all those things SHE DIDN\u2019T get to do due to COVID! This girl is a SAINT!!!! Some people would hate their siblings because of this, your daughter is a saint and a wonderful person. \n\nI hope your husband comes around and your daughter has a blast.

You don\u2019t just stop being a parent when your kids turn 18. Tell him to stop being an ass and do right by his daughter.", "NTA.  She missed out due to a world crisis and never complained.  It\u2019s great that you are helping her do something special.  Your husband is being a jerk", "NTA.  Your husband is a huge A.  You are rewarding good behavior when she was a minor, not making everyone miserable because she lost out in several important events to someone that age.  I don\u2019t think I could look at my spouse with any sort of respect if my spouse had your husband\u2019s attitude.", "NTA your husband sure is. Why is your husband so callous toward Misty?", "NTA - if this is a one off expense, you\u2019re fine and husband is TA.", "NTA and I think it's a really sweet gesture. I know other people suffered worse during the pandemic but I felt so sorry for seniors in 2020. I'm glad there's something your daughter would enjoy that you can help with.", "NTA- you did something wonderful for your daughter. 2020 was so hard on the kids who were graduating high school or college. They lost out on SO much! You spent the same amount on both of her siblings for their senior year activities, so spending a little on her now, when she missed out on all of those milestones isn\u2019t anything for your husband to be having a fit over.", "Your children (through no fault of their own) had very disproportionate senior years. Misty got the short end of the stick and surely the whole family can recognize that. You don\u2019t spend exactly the same on every child at every moment. A kid joins a sport or has a major life event (like prom or graduation) and you help them take part. Misty missed out on a lot and while you\u2019re not required to make any of that up to her, it\u2019s kind to acknowledge she didn\u2019t get the same opportunities and to try to give her something fun and positive for herself. We all deserve to celebrate a bit and the idea that she was shafted as a kid means she should be shafted forever makes no sense to me at all. You have a chance (and the funds) to give her something just for her that you would\u2019ve done in 2020. Why would it be too late now? As a sibling, I would also have zero complaints. It\u2019s fair and I\u2019d know it.", "NTA. I'm 29 and live on my own, but if I asked my dad for money or help he would not hesitate. Your husband has a warped sense of how to care for a child.

Your compassion for your daughter is just the right touch.\n\nYou aren't trying to recreate her prom or other senior events for her (or wailing, \"*oh my poor baby should have all these things made up for her!*\") It was just life that made her miss out on those things, and she wasn't expecting anybody to make that up for her.

Your husband has the benefit of a few decades of forgetting what all those milestones meant, and the excitement they held. He also has had enough disappointments in life that he apparently thinks there are no do overs. Which is his deal, not yours or your kid's. He doesn't have to agree with you that she deserves something special, too.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with treating your kid to something special once in awhile. And things don\u2019t always have to be exactly equal for adult kids. Adult kids need to understand that they all will get their turn to be treated to something when the time is right", "NTA if anything ask your kids what they think of it as a belated \"Senior trip\" and they'll probably see the reasonableness. You sound like a reasonable mom wanting to help an otherwise responsible daughter do something she can't do on her own. She even reached out well in advance to do something, so she book everything in advance and save money.\n\nI remember as a kid my parents did a lot extra for my older siblings than for me, but I also didn't want anything extra, so didn't have a problem with my siblings getting their experiences.", "so what is your husbands problem? is he a step or something? even if he is a total AH. NTA", "Nta but I don\u2019t think you should be looking at it as making up for missed events.", "NTA. I was also a 2020 grad. Missing out on so many milestone experiences was devastating. I still get upset thinking about missing my last dance recital (Id been at the studio since I was 5 years old). You did a good thing.", "NTA", "NTA - it\u2019s a perfect gesture. Those poor kids missed so much.", "NTA", "Nta. But your husband sure is", "NTA \nPerfectly fair thing for you to do. \nHonestly it was awful what youths/children have to miss out on. Was it really worth it? I think not.", "NTA - She didn\u2019t get a chance to have any of the usual senior rites of passage, *and* she didn\u2019t complain at all despite the fact a little complaining would be more than justified. It\u2019s a one time expense that is not even equivalent to the average cost of prom. I don\u2019t understand your husband or other children.", "That's basically what happened.  Misty wanted to buy a ticket for a \"cheap seat\" and was short $100.  I decided to take the money we could have spent on one of her senior year activities (for example, to pay for a prom ticket or a dress or a deposit on the trip) and upgraded her ticket to a better seat.  \n\nMisty is really good with her money.  This show she wants to see is a \"once in a lifetime\" experience for her.  And I agree, after everything she went through, she deserves it.  She's worked hard and needs a break.", "If Misty was under 18, it would be a different story.  My husband thinks that now that she's an adult, we shouldn't be helping her with funding \"fun\" activities like a vacation or a concert. He's on board with helping to pay for college, a car, house or wedding.  \"Adult expenses.\"", "Looks like a classic case of the middle child not mattering as much.", "You said this better than I did. I tried not to be so blunt. But yeah Dad hates Misty. And Misty knows it. She knows it long before this trip.", "I love this.", "I disagree about calling it a christmas present because he'll try to give the other two kids something of similar value when that isn't what its for. \n\nI'm pretty confident her siblings would say that this trip is a fair thing for her to have because 2020 shut down her senior year so much. The husband needs to reevaluate that this is money that would've been spent 3, almost 4 years ago that never was.", "NTA Mom. I would have done the same thing. How wonderful for her to have something to look forward to.", "I'm willing to bet that even her brother and sister wouldn't mind this and would be understanding and supportive.", "You're a great mom. I'm having my first baby in one week and now I'm sobbing. I can't wait to give my little girl an experience that she'll cherish one day \ud83d\ude2d", "You\u2019re an awesome mom.", "I know who\u2019s going to the good senior living home\u2026.", "And honestly kinda a nice break from school", "His rigidity isn't logical. He's being too hard here. Misty deserves this. He needs to remember it was a tough year for everyone. Now imagine missing out on the major life milestones everyone else gets. NTA.", "Which of your other children\u2019s senior year expenses would be consider \u201cadult expenses\u201d then?\n\nNTA", "Theres a difference between funding a single event. Assuming you\u2019re not giving her more down the road because of covid. And funding a lifestyle. Im pretty sure most kids would understand this is a big difference from favouritism vs single event despite how weird reddit can be.", "Well your husband should join us in reality where being 18 doesn\u2019t mean you are self sustainable in this economy.", "Can't he just be nice tho? Like, think about your daughters feelings? And also, it's not exactly fair that you guys spent hundreds on each of your other kids and not her....how heartless.", "So tell him Misty is short on rent because she spent her money on a Broadway ticket. /s\nHis logic makes no sense. She\u2019s being responsible, and he\u2019s being pedantic about her being an adult. She\u2019s still your kid, and it\u2019s kind and thoughtful to try to help it even out.", "oh yeah, why continue to care for them after 18 anyway?!\n\n/s for safety.\nNTA, but your husband is.", "Is he willing to have the other two kids pay back the extra they received when they graduated?  If her trip cost less, and everything has to be fair then suggest the other two pay back to make it all equal.", "Wow. Your husband's an asshole.", "He sounds like no fun. I am excited to do nice things for my kid even in adulthood.", "She\u2019s in college and has a job.  How much more does he want her to do?!  NTA I think it\u2019s a really nice way to give her something fun to look forward to.  Even though I\u2019m in my 50\u2019s I feel really bad for the kids who missed their senior year of high school, freshman year of college, etc.  (and yes, to me they are kids.  Nothing derogatory, they still are young enough to need some extra TLC from their parents.  You don\u2019t automatically mature when you turn 18)", "He sounds bossy. NTA", "Its money. the whole point is its liquid. If i give a friend 50 bucks. It is both gas money and grocery money, but at the same time it would also be beer money and video game money.\n\nlets just say for a simple exercise if one child you had been saving a college fund for got a full ride of their own merit. would you just not give them any money? The world shutting down suddenly made an expense that was planned for not happen. unless an equivalent expense replaced it such as buying a remote learning computer set up etc what does it matter the exact timing that money is worth. considering inflation if its the same dollar amount money before was worth more and youre still saving on what it would cost to make your daughter have an enjoyable experience", "18 is an arbitrary cutoff. Most high school seniors become \u201cadults\u201d in the middle of their final school year. Your husband is drawing a nonsensical line to argue against you doing something that seems super fair given what Misty missed in 2020.", "NTA. Tell your husband I said he\u2019s an asshole. Normally I\u2019d be on his side. But she got nothing her senior year and this is a beautiful token to give her something special since the other two got special events.", "You should be able to do something nice for your daughter without your husband being such a prick about it. NTA but your husband is. What a grumpy old man.", "NTA. Just because she's legally an adult doesn't mean you have to suddenly stop supporting her...or treating her occasionally! A gift like that would have also been appropriate for a number of reasons, like doing well in college, or helping a family member through a rough time, not just because she missed prom.", "I had an August birthday. I was the only kid UNDER 18 on my senior trip. Which I vividly recall because 18 was the legal drinking age there. \n\nSo\u2026maybe you already have a precedent of paying for \u201cfun\u201d expenses for \u201cadults\u201d\u2026", "I think I would just make it clear to Misty, \u201cThis is a one time thing. I\u2019m giving this to you in lieu of all the stuff you missed in your senior year.\u201d I can see how your husband doesn\u2019t want to set the expectation, but I think you can help her now without setting an expectation for the future.", "Maybe ask hubby given his lack of kindness you want to know who hurt him and how", "Your husband is an asshole of the highest level. From one father to another. That\u2019s the reason his children will stop talking to him.", "He wants things to be fair- he can pay for the missing senior class trip and the missed prom.", "This.  If my parents did that for my sister I would be think \u201cAw, she\u2019s going to love that!\u201d", "While I'm on your side regarding OP being NTA, your point makes no sense. The husband's point is that those weren't adult expenses because they weren't adults, they were in high school.", "Yeah like my sister was in the same boat as Misty her senior year and if my mom wanted to do something for her because she missed so much that year the rest of us would probably offer to pitch in to help. Her husband is wild thought like it's a one time thing.", "And a lot of people do nice things for their kids", "The best part of having adult kids is being able to do fun stuff with them without the added stress of looking after little ones. It\u2019s so much fun to hang out with and enjoy the company of the wonderful young adults they became.", "Well maybe the siblings were 18 when they attended those events. 18 you are adult.", "Most people are in high school as a legal adult for some amount of time", "Not a HS, just ES, but my daughter's class missed a school funded field trip in the 5th grade, because of lockdown etc.   \nWe, parents of the class, decided to \"make up\" this for them, because school couldn't.   \nWe rented a scouts' camp in the woods nearby (so teachers could arrange with school coming and have their lessons with them) and organised the trip with night-overs and Halloween party.   \nKids cooked self their dinner and were having a time of their life, preparing their costumes and Halloween decorations. We, parents, took shifts as chaperones. It was all very low-budget, as we haven't any financial help from school and wanted all kids attending. But kids were very happy and were saying that it was their best trip ever :).", "That\u2019s exactly how my older two feel about my youngest, who\u2019s class of 2020. He hasn\u2019t asked for anything, but if he did, they\u2019d want to pitch in. Heck, my oldest tried to take him to Disney a couple weeks ago but my youngest didn\u2019t want to miss class (college student) so declined.", "Not really.", "I was the only person I knew from my entire homeroom and 2 neighboring home rooms that was not yet 18 at graduation (though tbf that\u2019s a group of like 70 out of a graduating class of almost 800) also because of my august bday I\u2019ve been one of the youngest in my grade at every high school I went to (3 of them). \n\nWhile it\u2019s not the BEST sample size I think it does suggest that it is more common to be 18 at graduation than not.", "In my state most seniors turn 18 before graduating. For someone who graduated in 2020 it would only be kids with June and July birthdays that wouldn't have been 18. When I started school, the cutoff date was June 1st, so it was only a couple of kids who weren't 18 before graduation. Many students were 18 for the much of their senior year.", "Yes really. Only about 5% of my sisters graduating class of 1,500 students were not 18 at graduation. I was the only one at my graduation of 215 students and the cutoff there was December not September like most states.", "I was 19 when I graduated (mom started us later b\u201dboys mature later than girls.\u201d)."]}
