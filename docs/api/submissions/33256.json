I think best case scenario, brother needs to learn no to make bets and brother in law should drop it.", "The problem is that OP won\u2019t say HOW BIL cheated", "This is my favorite comment for every post that is going up on here today.  Like EVERY ahole out there sees Christmas as the perfect time of year to ruin the families and all of the nice people are confused and coming to aita to get clarity", "Id go after his knees with a bat till he said my brothers debt was clear. Maybe a little far but I'd definitely be losing my shit.", "Found the brother in law", "Agreed. It's a serious accusation when you're using to welch on 5k.", "I assume you're well versed in bird law too?", "In the UK, gambling debts are binding in honour only. They're not legally binding unless the premises has a proper gambling licence.", "Yeah IANAL and I'm Australian and it's similar here. However I'm fairly sure that's how the US laws work and since 99% of people who don't clarify what country they're referring to are from the US.. I just alternate between calling them out as you did me, or enabling them. Neither option is great, but what you gonna do, that country is narcissism embodied into a shitty country.", "Regarding legal proceedings there's a lot of variables there, not least of which jurisdiction. Regarding demanding someone pays their bet, you've already covered suing someone so assuming you're not referring to legal avenues twice pretending it's two different things, I'm not sure what a licence has to do with non judicial enforcement of a bet.\n\nRegardless of all that complete nonsense.\n\nit comes down to a singular point: did they cheat and can it be proven. If not I'm afraid it would appear OPs brother owes $5k.", "Home poker games are legal in many states.", "Are you the BIL?", "Buddy that husband blew Christmas up when he let his WIFES 19 YEAR OLD BROTHER get swindled. Fuck off with that", "Tonya? Is that you?", "I\u2019m the BIL because I want to know HOW he cheated? OP admitted to not seeing anything. They just assumed", "It is the same in my country. There is even a Latin legal term for it. \n\nPactum turpe - an agreement that is considered immoral and does not have the protection of the law.  So you cannot sue in court to settle a conflict.\n\nExamples: gambling debts, drug money debts, agreements to share the proceeds of a break-in, etc.", "Haha, well said \ud83d\ude02", "Youre not one to speak about shitty countries lol", "Ah ok, I did not know that in my country it's illegal.", "If it's over five thousand *pounds*, they're not in a state at all.", "How am I acting like the I\u2019m the BIL?", "I\u2019m serious.  I\u2019m going through all the comments today saying WRECK THEIR WORLD in all caps because every sweet kind person is getting extra screwed over right now and they need our help lol I\u2019m agreeing with you", "Husband doesn't know yet so he hasn't \"let\" anything happen", "That movie had me ready to riot for Tonya lmao", "Why you cheating 19year olds man they can barely dress themselves and they play with their food still.", "yeah Australia isn't great. I'm not a patriot.", "Oh no, I\u2019m Nancy! /s", "I\u2019m the not the BIL. And 19 is old enough know not to stupid ass shit like this.", "We have a massive gambling problem. We lose more money per capita to gambling than any other nation. Our advertising laws are fucked and it is insanely entrenched in our culture, even something as banal as news outlets and politicians calling the average working person the \"average punter\" shows just how fucked it is.\n\nNote: Punter is probably an Australian thing. In Australia, having a punt is to bet on something. We give so few fucks about ourselves that we refer to working class people as gamblers and most people don't think twice about it."]}
