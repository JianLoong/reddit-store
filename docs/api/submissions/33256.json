If they actually cheated, they are assholes, but your brother still played the game.\n\nIt sounds like your brother in law is a piece of work, but your brother still lost and knew what was on the table.\n\nThe acid test here for me, is if your brother won, would he expect them to pay up?", "Your brother: \n\na) is an adult\nb) placed bets that he could not afford \nc) did not know when to say to himself and walked away with a 5k debt \n\nHe did it all on his own.\n\nDon\u2019t know if your BIL is a cheat, but they certainly smelled a mug from a mile off. That\u2019s not on BIL, that\u2019s on your brother. If he was out of his league, he should have walked away.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things $5,000 is a lot of money to learn that gambling isn\u2019t for him, but it\u2019s cheap in the long run.\n\nIf brother got a job in Micky D\u2019s, earned $10 an hour, he\u2019d have the debt paid off in 500 hours\u2026 if he works 50 hours a week, that\u2019s ten weeks (not including taxes etc but you get my drift\u2026)\n\nYou husband will be able to talk your BIL into not charging interest or if he fails to pay, not breaking his legs\u2026\n\nIf you sit down at a card game and after twenty minutes, if you haven\u2019t figured out who the mug is, it\u2019s you.", "Why did he bet with $ he didn't have?  That is the first rule of gambling, wager only what you can afford to lose.  If they were cheating, then call them out on it, otherwise he owes the $ he lost.", "Nta. And if they cheated they owe him the 5k. Cheating at cards can have some serious result in some neighborhoods...", "This is absurd. If they were playing at home then there\u2019s no contract, no regulation, it\u2019s just a gentleman\u2019s agreement. And they were cheating anyway. If they are making threats to extort payment, report to the police.\n\nJust don\u2019t pay them and tell them go fuck themselves. Are they a mob family? Why is anyone considering paying them a penny?\n\nTell your brother to stop gambling before he gets involved with people who will break his legs. Tell your husband to grow a pair and tell his family if cheats to back off.\n\nWhy are you letting husbands family terrorize your brother? Assholes all round. Pathetic.", "Esh. Your brother is old enough to know better. Hes old enough to know whats in his pocket & what he can afford to lose. Was it dirty? Absolutely. Was it wrong. Sure was- both sides. Your brother isnt innocent in this & bailing him out just because he bet more than he had may just be what tempts him to do it again. Would you have made him give it back if.he won? I don't think you would.", "In my jurisdiction, the law explicitly says that any claims from games and bets are unenforceable in court, unless the game is operated by the State or an entity duly licensed by the State. Even loans provided knowingly so that a person can gamble are unenforceable. Moreover, if the loser has already paid and the amount is manifestly excessive given the circumstances, the loser can sue the winner to return a part of it.\n\nPerhaps there is a similar statute in the UK? \n\nFrom a cursory googling it seems that unlicensed gambling is completely illegal. So, I would tell the AH BIL to either go to court and sue (and potentially get himself in a whole lot of legal trouble) or get lost.", "NTA, cheating and expecting to get your cheated reward is already ridiculous.", "Going against the grain here but your bro is an adult. He didn\u2019t lose 5k over a single hand but played all night. Sounds to me like he needs to pay his debts and learn his lesson. A lot of entitled people in these comments as always.", "NTA. What an awful family. They sound like poor, white trash with no ethics or decency. I'm sorry you married into such a viper's den.", "NTA. Brother in law is an AH.", "NTA, and the one's trying to rip your brother off for $5k are scummy af.", "If they cheated,  smash their hands with a nice good old Hammer.", "Hopefully BIL is just teaching him a lesson. Maybe good on him, maybe brother was a drunk asshole. Too many variables when family gets together drinking and gambling, family get shot and stabbed over these things in the moment.", "ESH. What kind of family would let one person financially wreck another one another over a stupid poker game..? You\u2019re all AHs.", "A", "NTA I don't think anyone should pay him.", "NTA.  Your husband needs to put this to bed with his brother. And you need to have your brother tell your BIL this: \u201cI\u2019m not paying you a dime, call the cops or sue me.\u201d The dude trying to collect this from a 19 year old is pathetic.", "Tell him to go fuck himself and he's not getting a penny, he can go on as much as he wanted, but he will still be getting nothing, who gambles 5k with \"family\" for harmless fun unless you are a millionaire", "This is one of the most frustrating ESH's i have ever seen.  Your in-laws for trying to scam your brother, your brother for being a complete moron and gambling with money he doesn't have, and you for trying to get your husband to pay off your brother's stupidity.  God this is like the most infuriating thing i have read in a while.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey cheated. Tell them if they insist your brother pays you will make a police report for their fraud.", "NTA, your brother-in-law is lucky your brother is nice. If I found out I was cheated like that, I'd have them all over for a nice double-or-nothing game where me and some friends would beat the ever-loving shit out of them, like hard bats to face beatings, then claim they started it.", "NTA  \nCard cheats are owed nothing", "Info: Why did your brother gamble away money he doesn't have? I'm curious if the in laws took advantage of a mentally disabled person.\n\nWho loses 5000$ when they don't have 5000$.", "NTA.

While he's an \"adult\", that's still a child. \n\nI'd go to your husband. This is a fuck around and find out situation. Brother knows he's gonna get his ass whooped. \n\nAnd hopefully this is a lesson for your brother. When gambling, only sit at the table you can afford to sit at. It can be such a dangerous experience, mentally and financially. Not a bad one to learn at 19 (if the people looking for money aren't family)", "NTA - in addition to what\u2019s been said, I don\u2019t see nearly enough people pointing out that the kind of behavior that leads to gambling five thousand pounds away that they could not afford to lose is a problem in and of itself that stands on its own in isolation of the accusations of cheating. I understand he was, \u201cgoaded,\u201d but the only way you can lose five grand is if you decide to wager five grand and put that money on the table (in chips and spread throughout multiple rebuys all adds up to the same thing).  \n  \nIt weren\u2019t all that long ago that the mere allegation of cheating was a strong indicator that *somebody* was going to get shot. Less likely to lead to violence today, but many people will take the accusation seriously enough that it\u2019s not an allegation one should make lightly.", "NTA.\n\nYou probably should have warned your brother, and mentioned at some point throughout the game that he doesn't have that kind of money, but if your brother in law is insisting on bullying a 19 year old into \"paying his debts\", then he's TA.", "NTA and tell your husband right now what his brother has done. He will either back his brother up and demand your brother pay the debt or tear into his sibling for thinking it was a good idea to roll a 19yr old for \u00a35k that everyone knows he doesn't have. As for your own idiot brother tell him that gambling isn't a joke and that when anyone invites him to gamble that if he doesn't have the cash money on hand then he cannot play.

And pre-warn your parents about what happened so they can tell your in-laws to kick rocks.", "NTA. But tell your BIL that you will be contacting the police. See what he does then.", "I hope your husband has higher morals than his relatives.  Definitely not the AH.
