I have manipulative family that I walked away from for over 5 years now. Best decision of my life. Toxic people can be family members, and bloodline means nothing. My closest friends are the best family I have ever had! Good job standing firm and being brave enough to walk the isolated path in life! The strongest people are capable of making the hardest decisions. Manipulation has no place in family. Money leeching has no place in family. Real family would have thanked you regardless and remembered all the times you have been there for them voluntarily. You have done more than your fair share. Let others in the family help. Easy to pass judgement on those bearing the burden! That's what they're doing to you. The apology was in response as a last attempt to manipulate you to forgive and help! Petty tactic by them as a last ditch effort.\n\nNTA and good job standing up to the toughest thing, family.", "*There is a much longer backstory here but I'll keep it basic... this kind of language towards me has been a common thing my whole life, as the youngest in a large family... In the past I've always accepted their apologies.*\n\nI'm guessing the backstory is that this pattern has repeated itself your whole life: they treat you badly, they apologize, you accept it, they treat you badly again, they apologize again, you accept it again... They believe an apology is a thing the recipient is obliged to accept. It wipes the slate clean, leaving the door open to them treating you badly again in future.\n\nIs that how it tends to play out?\n\nAnd now you've astonished them by *not* accepting their apology, and saying: enough is enough, the slate is *not* wiped clean, and you will not treat me this way any more.\n\nYou are never obliged to accept an apology, especially not if you think it will merely lead to more behavior of the same type. \n\nNTA.", "NTA A half-assed apology doesn't delete the disrespect. Stand your ground", "This is hilarious, NTA.\n\nYou don't have to accept apologies if you don't want to. They are backing down because they've seen that you are not and it's their way of \"making you feel you are in the right\". This is narcissistic behavior and this upcoming trip will do wonders for your mental health. \n\nWhen asked for money, again, simply state I don't have any to give or borrow. I have my own life to live, given that you want me to be upfront on every communication.", "NTA. You getting brave is exactly what they are scared of because they do not like being told no by you.", "NTA - by accepting their apology you're inviting them to start again. Don't do it", "NTA but you know, sometimes familys get stuck in a sort of a loop were sudden members might be offended by name calling. It is not necessarily a conscious meanness. So my advise is to stick to your guns, except an apology without saying it was okay and be very clear that you will not tolorate a behavier like this anymore.", "They asked for you to chip in. In hindsight it might have been better to say you weren\u2019t able to help right now. \u201cMum can pay instead considering it\u2019s her house\u201d comes across as blunt and a little rude imo. Their responses mirror yours. Sounds like apologies are due both ways if any need to be said.", "ESH your reply was condescending and so was theirs. \n\nAccept their apology and make one of your own.", "YTA \n\nThey were wrong in saying those awful things to you. They apologized though and you learned a valuable lesson. Lesson being that it\u2019s time to hide how well off you are from your family. Don\u2019t talk about your job with them anymore. Don\u2019t flaunt your new car or new money with them. Money is an off limits conversation now. \n\nYou can still help your mum out if you want. But it\u2019s on your terms and the gifts come from you as gifts. It\u2019s admirable to help the woman who raised you. But it isn\u2019t a requirement. \n\nI say accept the apology but be wise in the future and leave money out of it. If you give money to your mum only tell your mum and only give it to your mum to manage, no middle man siblings. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s business anyway. If they bring it up then say you sorted it personally with mum in a way that is comfortable to you.\n\nIf they start those awful comments again. Call them out on the ridiculousness of it all. Calling you \u2018young man\u2019 when you are more successful is a manipulative tactic. It\u2019s messed up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
