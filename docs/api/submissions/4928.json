I moved away from my home state last July, to a very faraway state a degree. My parents helped me move. So here is what happened.\n\nMy stepfather made friends with this man via Facebook. It was/is a group page about fathers who have daughters that move to that particular state. It's to help fathers who have questions about helping their daughters transition from another state to this state. My stepfather became acquainted with this man online. My mother helped me move into my new apartment in the state, as my stepfather had to stay for work. My mother insisted that we meet this man in person. I don know why but meeting this stranger gave me weird vibes. I told my mother that I did not want to meet this man. She told me that my stepfather and her wanted me to meet this man to have a support network in the area. Again, I said that I wouldn't meet this man.\n\nAt some point, after saying this to her, we ended up in the car. I'm cannot remember exactly what escalated the situation, maybe I said something, but she started sobbing and eventually yelling at me. She said stuff like, \"You make me feel like I'm a bad mother. You make me feel like I can never do anything right by you. You never show appreciation for me. Anything I do for you ends up wrong. We know you're just trying to get away from us. We know you moved up here to get away from your family. You're so ungrateful. You only talk about the stuff that I do wrong!\" etc. I explained to her that I try to show appreciation as much as I can because this is not the first time she has expressed this to me. But she just reiterated that she was just telling me how she felt. I understand having the ability to express yourself to family is important. But, I did point out that I do express gratitude and that I had been expressing it more than she was either remembering or feeling. I make a conscious effort to express gratitude to her frequently because she has said these things to me periodically for years. Anyway, eventually, I caved and said I would meet this guy. I won't lie. This whole situation had me crying too. I just felt like a horrible and guilty. We ended up meeting this guy. It was fine. I haven't spoken to him since.\n\nEventually, I told my friend about this. They said it was reasonable for me to have a support network, but at 25 I should be making those connections with fellow students or professors, not strange men my parents had me meet because they know them from Facebook. They also said my mother's reaction to not wanting to meet this man was odd. That was the main word they kept saying, that the situation was just odd. Part of me, though, still feels really guilty about this, despite it being months ago. I often wonder, if I had just said yes to meeting this guy, would I have caused so much emotional turmoil for my mother? I could have avoided her crying and getting so upset by just saying yes.

This is super odd. Was this guy a father of a daughter in that state? I can see that they might want you to meet with his daughter, make a friend, learn about the city.. But it gave me the creeps too the way they wanted you to meet him. And your mom's reaction was over the top, especially to make you meet a stranger.", "NTA and your parents are naive and sexist. They have decided you need a male influence in your life to the point that they found a stranger to look after you. That person on Facebook could be literally anyone - do not be forced into meeting with him. Honestly, it's just plain creepy. \n\nWhy does such a page exist (parents whose children have moved to that state) except to exert undue influence over their children's lives? It sounds like a scheme to lure women into human trafficking with the parent's help to me.", "A Facebook group for dads who's daughters are moving out of state? \n\nSounds like a perfect group for predators. You were totally right to think meeting this guy was hinky.\n\nNTA. You should have stuck up for yourself and squashed mommy's guilt trip.", "NTA.  They really know nothing about this guy.  They met him on fb.  Sorry mom sounds like a major manipulator to me.  Bring on the tears to get what she wants.  Why on earth would they want their 25 yr. Old daughter to meet a random man they know through fb?  Creepy.", "NTA\n\n> My stepfather made friends with this man via Facebook. It was/is a group page about fathers who have daughters that move to that particular state.\n\nI cannot think of a non-creepy reason for something like this to exist. I could *kind of* imagine a group for rural parents whose kids move to big cities, let's say, but the specificity of *fathers* and *daughters* suggests that it appeals to the kind of men who consider their daughters to be their property.", "This is very creepy. I might be reading too much into this, but it sounds like your mother and stepfather were trying to set up an arranged marriage!\n\nYour friend is right. You should be creating your own support network, through your job or your friends or whatever.", "OMG... You are so NOT the AH... Trust that gut of yours! If it seems \"odd\", \"off\", or \"fishy\", the odds are good that's because it's seriously suspicious. I wouldn't want to meet him either, honestly. Mostly because you shouldn't have to meet some old guy who may or may not have a kid your age, who your parents met online in some FB group, and they've never met him in person either by this point.\n\nAs for what your mother keeps saying to you about her \"feelings\", it seems that if she brings those exact \"feelings\" up when she's not getting her way, and therefore they aren't real feelings, just a way to manipulate you into doing what she wants you to do.", "NTA this situation is just anecdotal to what seems to be a deep rooted problem in your relationship with your mother and maybe step father, although it may be more a personal problem or low self esteem on her part\n\nYou have to be the smart one here by solving the pb at the source, not by meeting a random man your parents weirdly hyper focused on", "NTA - making you meet random strangers from fb is super creepy and you shouldn't do something you don't want to  just because your mom is crying. Your mom needs to grow up and stop trying to manipulate you by making you feel guilty...", "NTA and your mother is giving off some MAJOR narcissist vibes which I suggest you look into. It's a good thing, I think, that you've moved so far away and idk maybe this was a last ditch attempt for her to be controlling and make a big scene over something ridiculous (going to take a stab that this isn't the first time that's happened)", "NTA. While I'm sure there are a few decent men on this -- let's just call it what it is -- verrrry strange Facebook group, it also seems like a wide-open gateway for predators and creeps. Maybe this guy was okay, maybe he wasn't. The safest thing would have been to follow your instincts and have stayed away from him. Your mom and dad were in the wrong on forcing you into this meeting.", "NTA\n\nThe whole situation is creepy.  You are 25 and well and truly an adult.  The whole FB group is weird.  The guys on there could be grooming young women.  Just no.\n\nAnd your mom's reaction... well she has some serious issues.  She's manipulative and controlling and when you don't do what she says, she cries and wails and says she's a bad mother till you do what she says.  Well she's probably right... she probably is a bad mother.  \n\nI too get the vibes of a controlling narcissist.  Maybe read up on narcissists and there may be a lot of red flags in your childhood.  You wouldn't necessarily see them because it's your normal.\n\nYour friend is right.  You feel guilty because you have been groomed to feel guilty by your mother and stepfather and how you've been living when you were in their home.", "You are NTA. Your mom is being gross. Don\u2019t fall for any of this. Please stay safe and don\u2019t meet anyone unless you are comfortable with it. You are grown. It\u2019s totally your choice.", "NTA. Your mother sounds very manipulative. And their wanting you to meet an INTERNET STRANGER is creepy AF. I would have refused as well.", "\nYou're not in charge of how people react to the boundaries you set.\n\nThat facebook group sounds way too specific and highly predatory, and I honestly think it would do you good to take this story to a student councilor. \n\nLook the guy up, and make a request through your councilor for this man to be removed if spotted on campus, as having him know what school you attend makes you feel unsafe.\n\nBlock his number, messenger, block him off all your social media. Even if you weren't made to give your info, your parent's ignorance may mean they gave it freely, thinking you'd be as safe as if they were signing you up for summer camp.\n\nWhen you feel able, finding a therapist could do you a world of good in learning how to set and keep boundaries, and detangle some of the mess your mum has put in your head.\n\nAnd you know what? This guy MIGHT be a legit safe, good, caring, decent father as advertised, but the way in which you were forced to meet him was not ok. You did not feel safe, your boundaries, wishes and instincts were entirely ignored. You owe him nothin, and it is perfectly valid to actively block him from your life by all means necessary.", "You can start out with an online support group of family and friends. As you meet people at school or your place of employment, local bars etc, your support network will grow with new friends and coworkers at a rate that you are comfortable with.
