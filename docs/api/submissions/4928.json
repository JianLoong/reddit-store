I moved away from my home state last July, to a very faraway state a degree. My parents helped me move. So here is what happened.\n\nMy stepfather made friends with this man via Facebook. It was/is a group page about fathers who have daughters that move to that particular state. It's to help fathers who have questions about helping their daughters transition from another state to this state. My stepfather became acquainted with this man online. My mother helped me move into my new apartment in the state, as my stepfather had to stay for work. My mother insisted that we meet this man in person. I don know why but meeting this stranger gave me weird vibes. I told my mother that I did not want to meet this man. She told me that my stepfather and her wanted me to meet this man to have a support network in the area. Again, I said that I wouldn't meet this man.\n\nAt some point, after saying this to her, we ended up in the car. I'm cannot remember exactly what escalated the situation, maybe I said something, but she started sobbing and eventually yelling at me. She said stuff like, \"You make me feel like I'm a bad mother. You make me feel like I can never do anything right by you. You never show appreciation for me. Anything I do for you ends up wrong. We know you're just trying to get away from us. We know you moved up here to get away from your family. You're so ungrateful. You only talk about the stuff that I do wrong!\" etc. I explained to her that I try to show appreciation as much as I can because this is not the first time she has expressed this to me. But she just reiterated that she was just telling me how she felt. I understand having the ability to express yourself to family is important. But, I did point out that I do express gratitude and that I had been expressing it more than she was either remembering or feeling. I make a conscious effort to express gratitude to her frequently because she has said these things to me periodically for years. Anyway, eventually, I caved and said I would meet this guy. I won't lie. This whole situation had me crying too. I just felt like a horrible and guilty. We ended up meeting this guy. It was fine. I haven't spoken to him since.\n\nEventually, I told my friend about this. They said it was reasonable for me to have a support network, but at 25 I should be making those connections with fellow students or professors, not strange men my parents had me meet because they know them from Facebook. They also said my mother's reaction to not wanting to meet this man was odd. That was the main word they kept saying, that the situation was just odd. Part of me, though, still feels really guilty about this, despite it being months ago. I often wonder, if I had just said yes to meeting this guy, would I have caused so much emotional turmoil for my mother? I could have avoided her crying and getting so upset by just saying yes.
