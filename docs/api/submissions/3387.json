He started ranting about how I'm being cruel for accusing him of such things and selfish for even entertaining the idea of keeping him and the kids out and ignoring them like that.\n\n\n\nHe stormed off and left and had his mother lecture me about how I'm being infair prioritizing work over family and stuff like that.

My husband has started treating it as if I'm not \"really\" working. He believes wfh isn't as much of a real job as leaving the house. He'd interrupt me at all times, send the kids in so I could help them get things done, he even goes in randomly and ask me to do things under the guise of \"just a minute, you won't get fired over a minute break\". I have grown tired of the constant barging so what I did was purchase a lock and lock the office to no longer give him access to interrupt me.\n\n\nHe found out and uninstalled it while I was. He said that it's his house and that I CANNOT lock him out of any room in it. I was floored once I saw that he threw the lock away. I went off at him just screaming my head off telling him that he was jeoperadizing my livelihood. and his body langauge and tone changed. He started ranting about how I'm being cruel for accusing him of such things and selfish for even entertaining the idea of keeping him and the kids out and ignoring them like that.\n\n\n\nHe stormed off and left and had his mother lecture me about how I'm being infair prioritizing work over family and stuff like that. Lastly, she talked about yelling at my husband and trying to intimidate and control him.\n\n\n\nHe's been quiet since then. Aita? For my reaction.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because the \"it's his house\" comment really angered me.\n\nAlso, he ran to mummy to tell you off? And what is he doing all day when you're working in your office if he's constantly interrupting you?", "If this is the only issue you have I\u2019d talk to your boss about going into the office if possible and explain the problem to him/her.

How old is your husband and has he ever had a job?  He sounds insufferable.  He sounds like my 16-year-old who has special needs (with developmental disabilities).  My daughter feels like because I\u2019m home, I need to be available to serve her at any moment for any reason.  She has tried to interrupt meetings. (The more important, the better.).  Found out she feared I loved work more than her because of my focus.  I had to explain to her that I love her.  I only work to provide for her.  If I didn\u2019t have to work, I wouldn\u2019t and would spend all my time with her (here, I exaggerated to make my point).  After that, she started to leave me alone to work or at least ask if I was busy before interrupting.  NOTE: my daughter has the mentality of a 10-yr-old.  It sounds like your husband wants to sabotage you, is jealous of your role as provider, or a combination of the two.  He sounds pretty pathetic.  What attracts you to be with him now?

So, for the \"my house\" nonsense, I'm guessing he just reacted poorly to you putting your foot down. If you relent now, he'll react even worse when you reach your next tipping point. Sit him down and explain that he's endangering your job with his attitude and actions. If he doesn't get it then go work at the office. If that's not an option, then find a shared office space to commute to or at worst, a library maybe?

You have every right to yell at him for removing the lock because he didn't get that you were actually *working* so you had to put a physical barrier in place.\n\nThis is addressed to your husband:\n\nMy brother-in-law's company fired their salesguy because he *wouldn't* tell his wife to leave him alone while he was working from home.  She'd constantly interrupt him and have him watch the kids while she went shopping or did something else.  His performance suffered and other people had to pick up his slack.  After they almost lost several potential customers because he failed to follow-up with them, they gave him the option of coming into the office full time or doing something to increase his productivity if he wanted to stay wfh.   He chose to do neither because he was convinced he was \"too valuable.\"  They fired him.\n\n*You* are endangering your wife's job with your attitude.  Your mother should have stayed out of it with her old-fashioned ideas.  Your wife isn't trying to control you, she's trying to get you to *respect* the fact that she is working and not as available.

When he doesn't pick up, ask for his supervisor and tell them it's an emergency and he must answer. Enough of that will make him realize what's good for the goose...\n\n...but then again I also realize there are children whose well-being will also be jeopardized when both of them are unemployed over something this petty.

Meaning did you work all the time you dated then got married? Was he jealous & possessive of any males around you?\n\nBeing in the office he couldn't monitor your actions but being in the home office, I'm guessing is restrictive solely because of him. \n\nMy first thoughts he's highly suspicious & can't trust you. He worries if you're doing some kind of *sneaky* cheating behind his back. He's getting more & more paranoid he can't stand any form of barrier between him & you.\n\nWhat's troubling, is it's escalating. At first, it appeared to be random intruding but when he took the lock off the door that's controlling & possessive behavior. I don't know what he told his mother & frankly don't care. He's trying to muster up support to make his actions *legitimate* by stopping support towards you. He's wielding any form of control over your work.\n\nThat's very important. This isn't something one can talk over it's becoming a form of stalking. I wouldn't put it past him to have wired the rooms of the house, computers and/or phones to monitor what you're saying and typing. Additionally, put trackers on the car, clothes, purse etc. to keep track of your whereabouts at all times.\n\nI'm not being a '*Chicken Little*' but realistic. Jealousy & paranoia can be forms of mental illness. Him shouting about owning the house & not allowing a lock won't let you work uninterrupted is concerning. You're his property, he's not respecting you as an individual & can't be separated away from you. Sabotaging your job is a just another component of this jealousy. I'm sorry, but let's say you quit, he's still going to be watching & monitoring what you do. That can turn dark with mental illness such as alcoholism/drug addiction. \n\nSuggestions? Seriously whether think it, at least pretend he's off that he could be tracking/recording you. That could mean inside car, house in multiple rooms especially your office. Don't ever talk on house or personal phones nor text or use any computer to talk about him to relatives and/or friends. Start encrypting work documents on home computer with passwords he'd never guess (no birthdates, anniversaries etc.\n\nUse burner phones leave hidden in the office & at friends'/relatives' homes can't tell if damaged.  Have sister other relatives, coworkers or friends to pick you up & change clothes, don't wear jewelry & leave purse/wallet somewhere else make sure if had recording devices/tracking. \n\nUse office phone while changing into other bought by others pick up at scene leaving clothes worn purse & whatever (not in car) but somewhere not in hearing radius nor tracking of yourself.\n\nContact the FBI explain husband is beginning to act irrationally & suspect him of stalking. Ask if they or local police can do a sweep of the house, phones, cars & personal items to ensure doesn't have tracking and/or recording devices.\n\nDivorce is not to be taken lightly. It can be considered if his actions towards you get worse & worse. If one gets a splinter, it's important to try to remove as quickly as possible. Why? It 'can' lead to an infection & if not treated amputation. One is minimal the maximum could have been prevented if acted in time. \n\nAct in time, this isn't you & him communicating. This needs a mental health professional working with him & possibly put him on medication. Extreme? Yeah, but this can end up involving your kids in his spiral. How many news stories the father shoots the kids to spite the mother?\n\nContact a very good divorce lawyer explain your husband's behavior. He/she will show how to separate your monies if have joint account diverted to another account in another bank. And tell you how to separate for a time being if escalates. Pretend it's a glitch or error on company didn't put in direct deposit.\n\nThis isn't normal although being gaslighted & pressured to think it is.
