Keep texts, emails etc. I have a bad feeling they might start making crap up to CPS involved.", "NTA you need to stay far far away from your parents and sister before they kidnap your kid", "NTA I am so sorry for your whole ordeal of being ghosted and now harassed as though giving up a baby is a natural, easy thing. I hope you will get the resource\u2019s you need to aid you with your baby. You will need to draw the line with your parents and sister even more so.", "NTA, you and your aunt need to mute, not block your sister and parents.  Most likely you\u2019re going to need the evidence showing how unhinged they are. Take the proof to the police and get it on record. Good luck.", "NTA but you may need to file a restraining order against them. Contact a local police precinct and let them know what's happening, and what your concerns are.", "Nta start looking for aid for single moms to get yourself set up. You need support and protection so they cannot take your child. I would also document what you can in case they try to use CPS to take your child", "Yikes, NTA, go after them for harassment. Maybe you can get a restraining order.", "NTA. Tell them if they keep it up you will file a restraining order. Get the law involved if they are going to keep harassing you. It sucks for them but you don\u2019t owe them your kid.", "So it's been basically a year since you got pregnant and had your child, and just suddenly right now your parents and sister bring up adoption as an option?  Finding that hard to believe.\n\nNTA. You're 18 and an adult, you can make your own decisions.  But raising a child alone at your age without family to help is going to be a real slog. Good luck I guess.", "NTA. Ambush tactics like this do not work on very easy calls. This is truly appalling.\n\nIf your mother, etc. doesn't think you are capable of caring for your son, they can file for custody. And if you (or your aunt) don't care to be followed or contacted by people who contact you without your permission, you can take a protective order out against them.", "NTA. Ignoring the issue of teen pregnancy, your family had no right to expect you to give up your child to your sister after discussing the idea behind your back and then harass and guilt-trip you for saying no. If they continue to harass your aunt, go to the police and file a restraining order against them.", "NTA.\n\nThis is over-the-top. You are a legal adult and they are trying to steal your child.\n\nNow, that's not to say that this is a crazy idea. It **might** make sense. It sounds like this will be very difficult for you. But that is for **you to decide**, not them. If they had asked nicely and accepted your refusal, I wouldn't be so pissed at them. But given how they are behaving, I am angry on your behalf.", "Nta. Life's gonna be tough but you are a legal adult and doing the best you can for your child\n\nadoption cases the birth mother is given 30 days to reconsider giving the child up. \n\nYour an adult, I'd get stable and raise your baby the best you can. I won't say life with be easy even with two parents both working it gets a bit much, so I can't imagine the stress your under. But you never have to be forced to give up your baby. Get a lawyer", "NTA-I know parenting alone isn\u2019t easy but that doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to try and take your son from you. He\u2019s your child not their chance at having a baby to raise.", "NTA OP\n\nWith that said you need/should do research in your state to see what the laws are and to see what help you can get as a single mother.\n\nFinally you are going to have to get a restraining order against them. They are not going to stop harrassing you and your aunt.", "NTA \n\nWho tells anyone to give up their child? Not when you have support in place to help you.", "Research your state laws and benefits and see what is out there for young single moms. I think you may be entitled to education, housing, etc. And file for child support. You are obviously capable of doing great things. If you are still in high school see if there is a local HS with free daycare. Good luck!", "NTA - They're being condescending and completely overlooking the love you have for your son. Just because they have money and two adults in the home doesn't mean they're entitled to your son. It's unfortunate that they can't have children but it's very unkind and selfish of them to try and pressure you into giving up your son. Don't do it and prove to everyone that YOU are the best possible person to raise your son. I can't believe they would be so bold to even ask you in the first place. Good on you for getting away from them. As as a side thought, if they're only willing to support your son financially on the premise that they're the ones raising him then what good are they as an aunt and uncle? Surely they can help raise your son without taking him from you. I'm shocked that anyone would try and pressure their sister into surrendering their son, get as far away as you can!", "Dude. Holy shit. No. That\u2019s\u2026not how babies work. \n\nKeep them on a strict info diet to anyone associated with them. They might think they\u2019re being kind to your family sharing info. \u201cYes, baby is hitting benchmarks. Yes, baby is well and happy.\u201d Lock down any social media profiles. If any nosy Nellie\u2019s ask \u201cI believe my sister needs mental help because of her traumatic miscarriages and her behavior was making me fearful for my baby\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nKeep your house very clean and your fridge stocked. Make sure you\u2019re up to date on immunizations and checkups. Have a good supply of wipes, diapers, and formula. Make sure baby\u2019s sleeping spot is up to snuff. Expect a visit from CPS.", "NTA", " NTA-this is insane and you need to file a police report on them asap in case they try to take your son. Get a lawyer and all this also in case they try calling CPS and try fighting for custody etc."]}
