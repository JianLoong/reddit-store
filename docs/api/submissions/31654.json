Just because they have money and two adults in the home doesn't mean they're entitled to your son. It's unfortunate that they can't have children but it's very unkind and selfish of them to try and pressure you into giving up your son. Don't do it and prove to everyone that YOU are the best possible person to raise your son. I can't believe they would be so bold to even ask you in the first place. Good on you for getting away from them. As as a side thought, if they're only willing to support your son financially on the premise that they're the ones raising him then what good are they as an aunt and uncle?

She'll be able to reassure you.", "How would it go if you called up your sister and said -\n\nIve thought about it and you're right. A baby should have 2 parents, and it's hard being a single mom and still be in school.  Why don't you give me your husband.  That way my baby can have a father. And since I am younger, and can actually have kids. I'd be better for him than you are. Since we're talking about just giving people away, I think it would be easiest if you just gave me your husband, and that way he can have the kid he wants, I get the help I need, and you can stop trying to make a baby with him.\n\nI mean that's about as ridiculous as them just ambushing you trying to take your baby the way they are.  If you had been telling everyone that you can't handle the situation, and don't want the baby it would be one thing. But to just ambush you and try to take your baby is absolutely crazy, selfish, and psychotic.\n\nNTA. And if they keep it up, you may want to look into getting a restraining order so they leave you alone.  They clearly aren't in their right mind at this point, and you and the rest of your family deserve peace, not harassment and fear they may escalate and try to kidnap your baby.", "This is weird for me because I kinda was on the other side of this once. \n\nmy sister (then 18) got pregnant. I was 34, and my wife and I had trouble having our own. while she was still pregnant and still deciding whether to keep the child or not, we made an offer to adopt the baby if she wanted to go that route. \n\nmy sister turned us down, wanting to keep her baby (makes sense). Now we never pressured her and made sure to even mention when offering that we weren't trying to pressure her, just give her options. We also never once brought it up again. nothing got weird between us. \n\nI think that there is a very delicate line you need to walk when making these overtures, and OPs family burned that line hard! They crossed it in the way that they initially asked, and then to keep pushing is... unconscionable to me. \n\nthis is obviously an NTA for the OP. I don't have any advice on how to help you, unfortunately. there are things you can do to appease them and lower the pressure while getting money and nice things for your child but not fully give in. I hate appeasing people, though, and prefer hard boundaries. restraining orders are possibilities as far as boundaries go.", "NTA - \n\nIf this was about the best interest of your child, they would provide financial support to him as their nephew. If this was about wanting a child to bestow love upon, they would be thrilled to do that as aunt and uncle. \n\nBut it\u2019s not about the best interest of the child, it\u2019s about using your son as a solution to their childlessness. Children are not stopgaps for grief and they are not a commodity to be traded. What they\u2019re suggesting is maternal abandonment, exploitation, and trafficking, and let me be very clear *it is a lie that this would be better for your son*. Who benefits? Them and only them. \n\nIt is morally reprehensible for them to remove their support from you and your son for saying no! \n\nOn behalf of adoptees everywhere, OP I\u2019m so proud of you. I can imagine how challenging it is to finish school with a baby at 18, and I have zero illusions about how difficult it is to access support and resources that should be readily available. But it\u2019s not selfish to keep your baby. It\u2019s not bad to refuse to lie to him and the world about who his mother is. You are literally saving your son from a lifetime of a very specific kind of trauma, and I just wish you both all the love and support you could ever find.", "Definitely NTA, and I'd really recommend taking steps (both you and your aunt) to go as LC/NC as possible for at least the next while.\n\nI sympathise for your sister's struggles, but its not your job to act as some sort of \"supplier\" for them to be able to raise a child when you are evidently a loving mother wanting to care for your son, especially when they've since began trying to guilt-trip and convince you into giving him up. The rhetoric that a two-parent household is automatically more \"stable\" than a single-parent is so unfair to the many incredible single parents out there. From all accounts you're doing a fantastic job at raising your son, while also completing your education (good for you!), and to me that's more important than just having two parents in a child's life.\n\nYou seem to have a great relationship with your aunt, which is amazing. I'd ideally try and sit down with her to go over the situation and make sure that she absolutely knows your position on this and you can each offer each other the best support possible until this (hopefully) dies down.", "You might try contacting a Womens Abuse shelter to see if there are resources they can help you with. What your parents and sister are doing is emotional abuse and a form of coersion.  Also call legal aid and ask for legal help. You and your aunt should block them all. Your parents and sister are cruel and selfish. You have any more paternal relatives further away you can live with? NTA.", "1. Why are they asking NOW, 3 months after birth, when you have been caring for him - and obviously intend to raise him\u2026?\n2. It is absolutely unhinged to ask for someone else\u2019s baby.\n3.

He had a health condition that would have gotten better but he got sick in the hospital and never got better. He was only around for a month. In that month my fianc\u00e9s sister repeatedly said if you can\u2019t do this we\u2019ll take him. (She screams back at the children her husband had like a child. I wouldn\u2019t trust her with mine.) and hated our answer of no. She also threatened to punch my fianc\u00e9 because he made the decision to go home instead of being there for the unplugging. (I fully supported him. He found his dad passed when he was a kid and he couldn\u2019t handle seeing his son pass.) said our dogs didn\u2019t matter as much as the kid. And marched out telling the nurse to contact her because we \u201cclearly couldn\u2019t handle this\u201d she also posted his private medical info and photos of him without permission and made comments in videos like I wish I could be there to tell them what to do. And it\u2019s kids leading kids. We were adults fully equipped to listen to the doctors and understand what was best for our child. I\u2019ll absolutely never forgive her. She made a hard time so much worse.", "NTA. \n\nIf it continues, seek a restraining order and document all contact they attempt.  Stand firm and good luck.", "NTA a baby is not transferable just because \"someone else wants it more\"", "I\u2019m glad you had a safe place to go with your baby. Parenting is hard and being a teen parent is three times as hard. You aren\u2019t wrong to keep your baby if you feel you have the support to properly care for him. \n\nIn my experience, women who really want children but have problems getting/staying pregnant tend to get tunnel vision and can literally only think about having a baby. They get pretty desperate. So I think your stepsister is out of line but just unable to think of anything except her need to have a baby. \n\nYour parents know how hard being a teen single parent will be for you and I think they are coming from a place of wanting you to have the freedom to be young before raising a child. But once you chose to say no, that should have been the end of it. Harassing the people who support you is wrong. \n\nNow it\u2019s time to do everything exactly right and be responsible so they are unable to use CPS against you. \n1 Tell your parents that you want them to have a relationship with their grandson but if this continues they will not have contact with you or your baby. \n2. Always be ready for CPS to show up unannounced. Plenty of formula, clean clothes, diapers, wipes. Safe sleeping place for baby. Stay up to date on all recommended doctor appointments/immunizations. \n3. File for child support if you haven\u2019t already. Dad doesn\u2019t get to walk away with no consequences. Showing you can provide for baby is important. \n4. Document everything your family does to undermine you. \n5. Make sure to show your appreciation for your aunt.

There are places to clothes, diapers, formula, etc. Go to HUD.org and search for public housing. Some people are going to say don't. Every city and state is different. Know that there are HUD subsidized apartments that work just like section 8 vouchers. The only difference is that the subsidy is tied to the property. They often have wait lists of a year or more. I know that seems like a long time, but get on lists! You're not taking anything away from anyone. If you don't need it, they offer it to the next person. There are pros and cons, but it is a lifeline AND shows you are actively pursuing housing/shelter. I'm currently in one, and it's not that bad. More inspections than I would like, but that also means they have to meet regulations and standards. Private landlords can try to get around. You have more protections in public housing than anywhere else. Just fyi.\n\nOn a personal note, I was pregnant at 18 just two weeks out of high school. I'm now 44, and my daughter will be 25 soon. I did everything I could to be a good mom. If though I realize I was also too young to parent at the level  I am parenting my youngest. However, it does not mean I, or you, were/are incompetent partents at that age. I'm just saying that books and classes WILL help and should be seen as an asset and not a criticism about you and your character. It also looks better for you should your family try anything with CPS. Take it from someone who wishes there was someone who could have this conversation with me. Learning from experts on how to up your parenting skills is a loving thing for your child. \n\nMy daughter is now a successful young woman with a career in software engineering. She loves her work and bought her own home at 23. I am so proud of her. She is articulate, kind, with an internal beauty that lights up a room.

He basically called me a degenerate, and I'd end up the stereotypical white trash single mom with the ungovernable child who does drugs and has three kids by their 18th birthday. Really gross stuff. \n\nI proved him wrong. And I'm doing it again with my other child (even though I was married and in my 30's that time). You can do this. You absolutely can be an excellent parent. Even at 18. \n\nGood luck, Mama!", "And document everything your parents and sister say. Time, date, place, situation.

The only other thing I might add to it is that if you qualify for legal aid, see if you can get some legal help/advice to protect yourself, such as a restraining order against them.

A teenager with no higher education has no ability to provide the resources to raise the child in a way the couple does. \n\nSaying that \u201cif they wanted to be good family members\u201d they could throw money at a knocked up teenager vs. saving that money for things like IVF or adoption? Really? \n\nThey want a child, not a niece or nephew. They shouldn\u2019t be burdened by the child or who had a child\u2019s ability to not use birth control. The child will realistically have a better upbringing in a two parent household with established in career adults statistically. \n\nI know I\u2019m going to keep getting downvoted to hell for this, but my high school boyfriend was in this situation and his mom kept him until after he turned 3 and then realized she wasn\u2019t capable of raising him. She did however, get pregnant a second time when he was 1, and then decided that it would be more fun to have a daughter than a son, so he went into foster care at age 2. It caused lifelong abandonment issues, so please excuse me if I don\u2019t trust an 18 year old who got pregnant as a child to make the best decisions for a child.", "Nice assumption, my throwaway accidentally became my permanent because I forgot to switch and spent more time using it without realizing I did. \n\nJust because you don\u2019t want to do something for someone you care for doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not the best thing for that person, especially if you\u2019re responsible for that human\u2019s well being. Sometimes the best thing to do is to do what\u2019s hardest for you because you love someone that much. It\u2019s a hard choice. But it\u2019s also probably better for the child in this situation. Realistically, how is an 18 year old with no higher education and a lower earning potential as a single mother going to provide a better life for the child than an economically established married couple?\n\nI realize Reddit loves to crucify harsh reality, but sometimes life is a harsh reality and if you really care about someone, you do what\u2019s best for them, even if it hurts, no matter what.", "Yes.  And don\u2019t block them, only mute.  Let them dig their own hole. If they communicate via email, set up a folder to filter things into, and only look when you\u2019re mentally prepared.

That\u2019s absolutely horrendous.", "Yes, but in this case, just hearing from an authority that they are, legally, crossing the harassment line may be a wake up call for the family to realize what they are doing.\n\nIn their mind, they figured out \"the best alternative\" and are just \"trying to make OP see that\".", "Frankly if this were me that line would already be crossed, trying to repeatedly over days pressure OP to force her to give them her child?  That is mind boggling, never speaking to you again level abuse.", "May want to apply for a restraining order. And then call the police for every single violation.", "This is why adoption should *never* be seen as the last resort- it should be something you already wanted to do. Otherwise you end up with heartbreaking cases of innocent children being treated badly for something totally outside their control.\n\nEdit: the last resort for infertility, I mean.", "Wtf... I\u2019d say deciding not to put yourself through further mental and physical trauma is going out on a good note?", "Wooooow. I'm so sorry people said that.

Sister needs therapy for sure.", "I\u2019m willing to give sis a shred of that benefit of doubt. Mom and stepdad?  Nah, they\u2019ve proven that they\u2019ve failed at parenting. Their job as parents should have been to protect the younger and take the necessary steps to steer sis towards help, if grief has indeed caused a break with reality.", "It is true that OP's sister could be experiencing PPD, which even without being Post-Partum Psychosis is more likely to include intrusive thoughts and/or an obsessive compulsive component. If that \\*is\\* the case, and I'm not saying it is, her sister is surrounded by people who are feeding the idea that it's reasonable to continue demanding that OP give up her baby after she has already said \"No\" and are joining in with the plan. It's really disturbing.", "This is not true! MTHFR gene polymorphisms do not cause miscarriages! That\u2019s old information that has been debunked. Extra folate or specially formulated folate does not prevent miscarriages.", "Medical Billing and Coding! The pay is excellent. When I got started in the early '00s, the starting pay was around $40k+ a year. It was a very nice salary that could comfortably provide for a single parent of one at that time. \n\nThere are eventual options to work from home depending on your employer, and it's a job that will never not be in demand. Healthcare is a solid industry to get into.\n\nBeing a biller coder is a certification, not a degree. You can also take an exam at the end to become a nationally certified coder, and it removes one year of apprenticeship (normally the first two years out of school). It also allows you to accept membership with the AAPC. Both of those help you get better jobs and higher pay right off the bat. Passing the national exam is a big deal in that industry. It's definitely something worth looking into. \n\nYou can get pell grants since you're a single parent if you find a program at a community college. That money can go towards living costs, not just schooling. Also, most states offer child care assistance up to age five, I think. It will be run through your state agency that handles food stamps and medicaid. Every state is different, so I can't say for sure.", "The mother is not under any obligation to share parenting time or responsibilities. Ideally, her family would talk out how they can be the best support system possible for her and her son-*without requiring anything in return*-because a support system is what she needs. \n\nBut plenary adoption is not an \u201cit takes a village\u201d proposal, it is a legal fiction that requires the mother to relinquish parental rights. And while legal definitions of child trafficking tend to focus on labor and sexual exploitation, children can be and absolutely are trafficked for adoption. Also, legal code is not the only definitive source. But you can reference the term child laundering for an overlap of adoption and trafficking or reference any state code which will indicate that it\u2019s illegal to solicit a woman for her child, en utero or otherwise. They asked for the baby point blank, explicitly framed it as an adoption (IE legal severance and transference), and offered compensation in the form of financial and existential support for the child, which they a) did not offer before and b) are withholding now that she has declined their offer.", "I totally agree. You can't just go up to a new mother and expect her to hand over her baby and then start harassing her when she said no.  Time to cut off that side of the family.", "I agree. A one time ask/offer before the baby was born and then drop it as soon as OP said no would have been somewhat reasonable. Waiting until the baby was  3 months old and then bringing their (OP and sister\u2019s) parents in to pressure OP is just wrong on so many levels.", "Yea, right!?

You can have an amazing teen parent that raises a well-mannered, intelligent, empathetic, child, you can get an older parent in their 30s/40s that neglects, mistreats, over spoils, or whatever.\n\nAge, relationship status, income levels, etc have no correlation to parental ability. Obviously, some of these can affect the style in which a child is raised, but this does not mean that any or all single parents, lower income parents, higher income parents, etc are good/bad parents, the knowledge, discipline, morals, behaviours, etc they instill in their kid/s is what matters in the long run", "Me. You now know someone who got pregnant at 18 and successfully raised their child to be a successful adult. It's too late to focus on the should haves.", "You are projecting. Stop it. And shut up with your statistics. People with income can still be shit parents who mess up their kids for life. Love is louder.", "\"They want a child not a nephew.\" Yes, that's the selfish part. Understable, still selfish. And I didn't say throw money at her, I said resources, yes money is one, there's also time, emotional support, love...\n\nAnd you shouldn't trust 18yo with anything. They shouldn't be allowed to vote IMO. And 16yo shouldn't be allowed to drive cars. And people under 25 should not have kids  preferably under 30 actually. Or get married.\n\nAnd until there's a licence you need to get before having kids, I don't trust anyone to make the best decisions for children. However, if one has a child, wants to keep said child and is working towards providing the best life they can for them, I don't think it's right to go and try to bully them into giving up.", "Placing their child with people who harass others for a baby is not a better option.", "So all poor people should just put their babies up for adoption by your logic. Everyone has bumps in the road. There's nothing saying OP won't land on her feet, or further education, or win the lotto, or marry rich, or anything else that allows her to provide a comfortable life for her son in the near future.

Reminding people that I only had a 50% success rate, that it took 4 yrs to have the first one, and that my husband and I were both completely at peace about it usually shut them up.", "They really had it all worked out behind OPs back.

There is no way they will not be involved unless they pay absolutely no attention to the child. That would horrible for the child. Op is better off with her aunt.

I actually had to warn intake about an abuser. Got an Adult into a facility so that he\u2019d be safe from his abuser and the abuser started making false reports against the facility that I had no choice to investigate despite knowing it was BS. Was their attempt to make it so that the Adult had to move back in with them. Once my supervisor and I warned intake about the situation, we stopped getting the reports. Basically, abuser may try to make reports but intake is much more likely to trash the report rather than assign it to an investigator.", "Peace is the most powerful thing of all.", "I can see how parents might have thought it was a good solution. 18 is incredibly young to be a parent.

They might even think that OP can try again later if she wanted. \n\nAll of this would be reasonable if OP didn\u2019t want to be a mom, but she does and she made that clear.

If I had to do it over, I MIGHT have waited a few years.  At almost 60, I have so much wrong with me, including loss of cartilage several places and fibro, I am glad I had them when I did. Oh, and I was already out of high school when I first got pregnant."]}
