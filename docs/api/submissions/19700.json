It sounds like she is being very logical about this.  \n\nFor many people there will never be a right time.  I had my first kid at 27.  My husband and I rented.  Our combined income in a HCOL area was under 100k.   I have made a lot of mistakes in life but I will never regret starting our family when we did.  I am now in the age range you mentioned starting for a baby.  I had no idea I would get sick.  I had no idea medical doctors would tell me in my early '30's it is unsafe to get pregnant.  I firmly believe if I had waited I might not have ended up with children at all.  \n\n\nBTW many of those estimates for how much kids cost are wildly inaccurate.  While we are much more financially stable now, we love affordably, low debt, and moved to a LCOL area.", "YTA because in a comment you said you\u2019re are both high income earners and your posts states Charlotte is sending you spreadsheets making it clear you can afford it and that she doesn\u2019t want to wait. Elias is right.", "YTA, for not listening to your wife and what she wants to do.  It\u2019s getting late for her to have children, pregnancy after 35 is considered high risk, you are being very selfish.  \n\nThis whole setup is weird.  Your best friend is a work colleague 10 years younger than you that you invited to a family reunion?  And he said yes?  He and your wife took care of the children at the family reunion?  That your wife didn\u2019t want to go to (even though you were hosting it) because she didn\u2019t want to have to do extra work, which she then volunteered for?  Really?", "YTA. i await for your post in r/relationship_advice when your wife dumps you to have a baby with your friend.\n\nedit: typo", "YTA. Getting pregnant doesn\u2019t always happen right away - in fact, it takes a full YEAR of trying without success for it to be considered infertility. Your wife wants kids now, and you\u2019re refusing to listen to her, so Elias is jumping in to hopefully make you see what she\u2019s trying to tell you.\n\nYour sperm quality is declining. Her fertility and egg quality is declining. Your wife doesn\u2019t want to have a geriatric pregnancy, which is *reasonable*.\n\nElias isn\u2019t the problem here - your lack of listening to your wife *is*", "YTA for stonewalling your wife on this issue when she doesn't have many fertile years left. Doesn't matter that you aren't in an \"ideal\" financial situation. She would be well justified to dump your ass and look elsewhere for a sperm donor since you are not being real with her about what you want. If you don't want kids, let her go. If you do want kids, it's almost too late, biologically speaking, to start trying, and your wife will have very good reason to resent you if when you finally arbitrarily decide you're ready for it, it turns out to be too late.", "YTA - Not for telling your friend to but out, but for constantly disregarding your wife. You CAN afford to have a child, your wife has shown you the spreadsheets and you've confirmed it. Your friend is just a mouthpiece for your wife seeing as you have no consideration for her wants. Just divorce her and let her get with someone who will give her the child she clearly desperately wants instead of stringing her along with false promises you're likely not gonna keep, let's be real.", "YTA. \n\nI would agree that Elias was overstepping if it wasn't for the fact that it's obvious he is saying what he is to get through to you on behalf of Charlotte. The reason that you're the AH is because you seem to have no regard for your wife's feelings or wants. From your post and your comment claiming that the matter is \"settled,\" it appears that your wife has absolutely no choice but to go along with what you want, despite the fact that she will be the one affected in the long run. \n\nYour mother had you at 41. That's great for her, but for most women, that is incredibly dangerous. Children born to women in their 40s have a much higher chance of birth defects and conditions such as Down Syndrome. \n\nYou may not see it this way, but you are wasting your wife's precious time. You claim she still has time to have a child, and in theory, she does, but what if she wants to have more than one? She likely would not have much time to recover in-between if she wants to have them at a safe age. It already takes nine months to carry a child, and while a woman can have sex as early as 6 weeks post-birth, most women would not be fully recovered physically by then, let alone in an appropriate mental state to have another. \n\nYou're a man. You could technically have a child at 100 years old if your body still allows it. She doesn't get that opportunity. You are allowed to feel whatever you feel, and if you want to wait, that's your prerogative, but don't be pissed if she leaves you for a man that's willing to give her what she wants without having to literally beg for it.", "Does anyone else see Charlotte & Elias having kids lol?

Of course if she feels that she is uncomfortable with waiting much longer this is something the two of you need to figure out together. But a lot of the science on women\u2019s fertility is based on data from 300 years ago. Health, nutrition and medicine have changed massively since then. Among women aged 27-34, 86% will have conceived within a year of trying. The figure is 82% for women aged 35 to 39 - so only a little lower.\nAfter that, the picture is a little less clear, but 31 isn\u2019t the cutoff, and neither is 35.

But the issue is that you don\u2019t seem to be hearing that your wife wants children now. \n\nYou have no idea if you two are even fertile, and to get infertility treatment you often have to try for a year, and then wait another 6-9 months for a reproductive endocrinology appointment to open up (in the US). By that point, nearly 2 years have gone by. And then it\u2019s another 9.5 months of being pregnant. That\u2019s 2.5 years.

The rates of complications for both mothers and babies start to go up quite a bit, which is why \u201cgeriatric pregnancies\u201d (also a commonly used medical term for those over 35) are flagged in the medical system and healthcare workers are on high alert for complications. Not all complications are treatable.\n\nBasically what I\u2019m saying is that you don\u2019t have much more time to decide you\u2019re in the right spot for having kids. If she wants more than one kid, and this is important to her, she may very well decide to walk away from you very VERY soon.
