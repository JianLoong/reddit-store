It sounds like she is being very logical about this.  \n\nFor many people there will never be a right time.  I had my first kid at 27.  My husband and I rented.  Our combined income in a HCOL area was under 100k.   I have made a lot of mistakes in life but I will never regret starting our family when we did.  I am now in the age range you mentioned starting for a baby.  I had no idea I would get sick.  I had no idea medical doctors would tell me in my early '30's it is unsafe to get pregnant.  I firmly believe if I had waited I might not have ended up with children at all.  \n\n\nBTW many of those estimates for how much kids cost are wildly inaccurate.  While we are much more financially stable now, we love affordably, low debt, and moved to a LCOL area.", "YTA because in a comment you said you\u2019re are both high income earners and your posts states Charlotte is sending you spreadsheets making it clear you can afford it and that she doesn\u2019t want to wait. Elias is right.", "YTA, for not listening to your wife and what she wants to do.  It\u2019s getting late for her to have children, pregnancy after 35 is considered high risk, you are being very selfish.  \n\nThis whole setup is weird.  Your best friend is a work colleague 10 years younger than you that you invited to a family reunion?  And he said yes?  He and your wife took care of the children at the family reunion?  That your wife didn\u2019t want to go to (even though you were hosting it) because she didn\u2019t want to have to do extra work, which she then volunteered for?  Really?", "YTA. i await for your post in r/relationship_advice when your wife dumps you to have a baby with your friend.\n\nedit: typo", "YTA. Getting pregnant doesn\u2019t always happen right away - in fact, it takes a full YEAR of trying without success for it to be considered infertility. Your wife wants kids now, and you\u2019re refusing to listen to her, so Elias is jumping in to hopefully make you see what she\u2019s trying to tell you.\n\nYour sperm quality is declining. Her fertility and egg quality is declining. Your wife doesn\u2019t want to have a geriatric pregnancy, which is *reasonable*.\n\nElias isn\u2019t the problem here - your lack of listening to your wife *is*", "YTA for stonewalling your wife on this issue when she doesn't have many fertile years left. Doesn't matter that you aren't in an \"ideal\" financial situation. She would be well justified to dump your ass and look elsewhere for a sperm donor since you are not being real with her about what you want. If you don't want kids, let her go. If you do want kids, it's almost too late, biologically speaking, to start trying, and your wife will have very good reason to resent you if when you finally arbitrarily decide you're ready for it, it turns out to be too late.", "YTA - Not for telling your friend to but out, but for constantly disregarding your wife. You CAN afford to have a child, your wife has shown you the spreadsheets and you've confirmed it. Your friend is just a mouthpiece for your wife seeing as you have no consideration for her wants. Just divorce her and let her get with someone who will give her the child she clearly desperately wants instead of stringing her along with false promises you're likely not gonna keep, let's be real.", "YTA. \n\nI would agree that Elias was overstepping if it wasn't for the fact that it's obvious he is saying what he is to get through to you on behalf of Charlotte. The reason that you're the AH is because you seem to have no regard for your wife's feelings or wants. From your post and your comment claiming that the matter is \"settled,\" it appears that your wife has absolutely no choice but to go along with what you want, despite the fact that she will be the one affected in the long run. \n\nYour mother had you at 41. That's great for her, but for most women, that is incredibly dangerous. Children born to women in their 40s have a much higher chance of birth defects and conditions such as Down Syndrome. \n\nYou may not see it this way, but you are wasting your wife's precious time. You claim she still has time to have a child, and in theory, she does, but what if she wants to have more than one? She likely would not have much time to recover in-between if she wants to have them at a safe age. It already takes nine months to carry a child, and while a woman can have sex as early as 6 weeks post-birth, most women would not be fully recovered physically by then, let alone in an appropriate mental state to have another. \n\nYou're a man. You could technically have a child at 100 years old if your body still allows it. She doesn't get that opportunity. You are allowed to feel whatever you feel, and if you want to wait, that's your prerogative, but don't be pissed if she leaves you for a man that's willing to give her what she wants without having to literally beg for it.", "Does anyone else see Charlotte & Elias having kids lol?

Of course if she feels that she is uncomfortable with waiting much longer this is something the two of you need to figure out together. But a lot of the science on women\u2019s fertility is based on data from 300 years ago. Health, nutrition and medicine have changed massively since then. Among women aged 27-34, 86% will have conceived within a year of trying. The figure is 82% for women aged 35 to 39 - so only a little lower.\nAfter that, the picture is a little less clear, but 31 isn\u2019t the cutoff, and neither is 35.

But the issue is that you don\u2019t seem to be hearing that your wife wants children now. \n\nYou have no idea if you two are even fertile, and to get infertility treatment you often have to try for a year, and then wait another 6-9 months for a reproductive endocrinology appointment to open up (in the US). By that point, nearly 2 years have gone by. And then it\u2019s another 9.5 months of being pregnant. That\u2019s 2.5 years.

Not all complications are treatable.\n\nBasically what I\u2019m saying is that you don\u2019t have much more time to decide you\u2019re in the right spot for having kids. If she wants more than one kid, and this is important to her, she may very well decide to walk away from you very VERY soon.

People are rarely in an \"ideal\" position financially to have kids, and waiting until you are is a risky proposition because if you end up dealing with any sort of infertility, then you could find yourself in a great financial position . . . and unable to have children because you waited so long. It's not just about the pregnancy risks, it's also about the fact that it can sometimes take years to GET pregnant. \n\nI don't blame your wife for being frustrated with you. As someone significantly older than you who wanted kids more than anything and never ended up having them because i made some of the mistakes you're making now . . . stop assuming that everything should be done according to the \"ideal time\". That's a good way to logic yourself right out of ever having children. It happens far more often than you know.", "My MIL had her children at 42 and 45. Her daughter started trying at 32. It took over 3 years for her to get pregnant with her first. \n\nMoral of the story: you can't plan your life based on your parents' biological realities.\n\nElias and Charlotte probably chatted about children at the reunion. I wouldn't be surprised if your wife is concerned about waiting the way you want and that she feels her biological clock is ticking and she's running out of time. I had similar concerns at 31. \n\nYTA. Elias seems to be sticking up for your wife, since you insist on dismissing her when she talks.", "You are absolutely risking her not being able to get pregnant when you finally decide *you* want a kid.  It's a grossly unfair biological fact that you have no biological clock, but your wife absolutely does.  Maybe this marriage is not compatible.  Your wife has to think seriously about whether she is willing to wait 3 years for you to decide that you are finally ready to start trying to have a kid.", "Your waiting to be settled to have kids reminds me of the 'intelligent' couple in the beginning of Idiocracy. Sometimes there's never a 'good time'.", "That's not the way probability works. In the next few years her chances will be dropping drastically. You obviously haven't read the first homework assignment! Some women can get pregnant after 35, but many can't because their biological clock has run out.", "By 35 I was in menopause not everyone\u2019s the same and you can\u2019t bet on that. Yes many have children later and later but they have thousands and thousands to pay for ivf usually for many years before they get lucky once. I also have a friend with two children one an adult and the second one born 15 years later who has extreme disabilities and learning problems. She was told it was fully because she was an older mother. Her child will never be able to be independent and always will need care. So you can\u2019t just blankly say time means nothing.   \nMy plan was always to have a well established stable career before waiting to have kids in my thirties. Luckily once married and settled way younger we decided not to wait, if I had I\u2019d would t have been able to have any kids.   \nLife is not something you can fully plan. Even when other friends had kids in their late thirties I had no idea how they\u2019d manage all the running about. I know even if I had managed to have a kid at that age I\u2019d not have been able to be as hands on and active. Dont get me wrong I exercise and stuff but I physically wouldn\u2019t be able to run after a toddler by that point. I\u2019m now disabled which we had no idea would happen at the age OP\u2019s wife is, I was always the fit active one.

It doesn't sound like you like her very much.", "Honestly, does OP even like his wife?", "You don't even know that she's able to have children NOW. You're assuming. Lots of people make the assumption that they'll get pregnant easily when they want to. That's not how that works.", "If they\u2019re friends then he probably really is sticking up for her because he knows she wants kids now but, you\u2019re NTA for asking him to butt out", "How much more can your saving go\nUp in 1-2 years. Really you sound like you don\u2019t want kids and ate making excuses why you can\u2019t.", "Sounds like the matter is not settled for Charlotte. \n\nIt's also odd that you seem to be dismissing her feelings and suggesting that these feelings are primarily a result of your friend's influence, like she has no agency herself. It looks like his only role in this has been to be a friend to her and listen to her when she talks about what she wants. Maybe try that yourself? Is it possible that you have not been hearing her? \"The matter is settled\" makes it sound like *you* have decided and ended the discussion. If that's the case, I think the problem here is between you and Charlotte. Elias is kinda beside the point.", "It's not common sense to wait. You have no idea how long it will take to get pregnant. 31 is not young when it comes to trying to conceive for the first time. If you wait 2 years to start trying, 6 months is the average time a healthy young woman takes to conceive, 9 months pregnancy, she'll be 34-35 when giving birth. *best case scenario* if it takes a bit longer or you aren't able to naturally conceive you're looking at a lot more time.\nMaybe look at the charts yiur wife keeps showing you", "Just focus on you and your wife's needs. He's not married to her, you are.", "Well, then Elias is basically just voicing what SHE is thinking. She is probably the one who asked him to talk to you as a guy friend. And, to be honest, while your financial considerations do make sense, so does her desire to start sooner rather than later as she doesn't know yet how difficult it might be for the two of you to conceive, and how her health will be affected by pregnancy. Like it or not, she is on the clock here, and she bares much more risks for having that child later than you do.

Not saved up enough?", "No, you stodgy pound cake, you will incur massively larger expenses by waiting any longer. Just add $1,000 to the bill every single day you wait.", "I think you read it wrong. Waiting another year or two means there will likely be another $200,000+ it can cost.  Unless you're putting 100K plus away every year for this, then you're costing yourself more money by waiting. You can't control everything, especially when it comes to kids. Waiting to be 100% or even 50% financially prepared means you'll be waiting forever. You won't be in a better financial position by putting this off, so you need to choose to have kids or if you're going to push this off until your wife can no longer conceive. If you choose the latter better tell your wife now so she can decide if that's a breaking point or not.", "Your kids can go to a cheaper school and still be happy.

Because if thats the case you're looking at several months for trying - let's say 6 months of trying which is pretty average, plus nine months of pregnancy, plus experts recommend waiting about 18 months between intentional pregnancies, 6 more months for trying, 9 more months of pregnancy...that's 48 months or 4 years already and it's a conservative estimate.\n\nOnly 8/10 women get pregnant within the first year of trying so she could be one of the 20% who don't, then realistically 10-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage so that can set you back too by several months as you move through grief and wait for periods to return normally, then start the timer over on trying to get pregnant. You could end up needing medically assisted pregnancy since sperm also starts to degrade with age, and just the wait to meet a fertility doctor in some places is 6 months to a year, then testing, then waiting, then testing, then trying for a pregnancy and hoping it works.  You could very well end up four years from now with no baby wishing you started now, or one baby and struggling heavily to have a second pregnancy.\n\nNow, you could also end up on the other side and be one of the lucky ones who gets pregnant first try and again three months after the kid is born.
