And so I was like \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?\" to my mom and about how I didn't like her and it should be obvious. My mom said that she knew in the past I insisted that I would never ever go to a rap concert (I hate all rap too), but Taylor Swift isn't rap and I like going to concerts...I told her that doesn't matter because she still sucks. The only bands I've seen have been in very small venues or even just basements and full of people moshing and crowd surfing and going crazy, nothing like Taylor Swift! And my mom said even if I didn't like it if she was busy then could I do her a favor and take my sister and my said absolutely not because I'd rather dip my hands in boiling water than go see Taylor Swift and that I'd be too embarrassed at any of the shows I do like to go to if anyone there knew that I actually went to a concert like that. My mom said that I'm being really petty and rude. I explained that not all girls my age like Taylor Swift and she's like the exact opposite of what I like so that's like an insult and I don't want to torture myself at something like that.\n\nWell now my mom seems actually kind of upset at me, but I don't see why she couldn't just take my sister or have her go with a friend if her friend's mom's or sister's are taking them, so am I an asshole?", "created_utc": 1667608322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymf9kb/aita_for_refusing_to_ever_take_my_sister_to_a/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I despise Taylor Swift as a person. But if it was about spending time with my sister, doing a favor for my mother, and I didn't have to pay I would go to the concert.", "Soft YTA here. If your reasoning was you didn\u2019t want to be in charge of your sister / parenting then I\u2019d get it. But instead you just droned on about how you dislike TS. We get it - you don\u2019t have to like her. But jeez tone it down? Being asked to do a favour for your mum and sister should ignite such feelings of anger. \n\nAgain, you don\u2019t want to look after your sister. That would be fine.

Grow up.", "Listen. I get it \u2013\u00a0you're young, you're developing your identity and your interests, and you're becoming your own person. You're allowed to not like things. Swift isn't my particular cup of tea, either, and I'm not likely to shell out that much money to see a show just by myself. But it sounds like you're more concerned about your reputation and a perceived backlash in your community for being seen at a Taylor Swift show, than actually whether or not you'd enjoy yourself. And that's where YTA.\n\nI'm sorry to say, you are being really petty and rude. I hope you realise that you're trashing your sister for something that she genuinely seems to love in trying to get your point across on how much you hate Taylor Swift and \"prove\" that you're not like other girls. But you don't need to prove anything about yourself. You're still going to have your own identity and your own interests, whether or not you chaperone your kid sister at an activity she loves for her birthday. One concert won't somehow make you less of a fan, and anyone who tells you otherwise is gatekeeping and full of it.\n\nMaybe don't approach it as a concert for you. Maybe approach it as a way to show your care for your sister on her birthday. She will think you're the most incredible older sister ever, for taking her to a show she loves that she knows you don't enjoy. Honestly? There's nothing more punk than that.", "NTA  Taylor swift sucks", "YTA but not for refusing to take her. If you don\u2019t like Taylor Swift and don\u2019t want to go, well that\u2019s that.

Not for disliking Taylor Swift (I'm with ya there, her shrill voice just sets my teeth on edge) but for not being a team player.\n\nIt's your little sister, they make earplugs, and heck, you might have fun despite the fact that the music sucks.  Concerts are what?  An hour or two?  Don't think of it as going to a concert, think of it as spending time with your sister.    \n\nI went to a number of crappy movies with my little sister, and my mom still jokes that I always took her ice skating, even though she'd be frozen in a matter of 15 minutes and I'd have to leave my friends and bring her back home again.  \"Mom, her lips were blue, I had to bring her back.\" :D", "YTA - oh my god I\u2019d rather die than spend a night with my sister at a concert she\u2019ll enjoy. So dramatic.  Get a grip, not everything is about you.", "I don't get why people are calling you the asshole here. It's no different to being asked to take on any other parenting task which is not your responsibility. \n\nIt's not your thing, you won't enjoy it and don't want to go. That should be the end of the conversation. Kids are not free babysitters for other kids. \n\nAlso Taylor Swift sucks. NTA.", "\ud83d\ude02\n\nYTA, from an old emo kid.

We get it. You\u2019re not like the other girls. Congrats. *slow clap* \n\nSometimes being family means doing something you don\u2019t like for the sake of someone else.

[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R36QqA8yvfI) is the lead single from her latest album. Even some of the [quieter covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPsAxEWsKUk) sound surprisingly good, I think she's one of the best pop songwriters in the charts at the moment.\n\nAnd if you've only ever been to small shows before, a big one is a must. Iron Maiden play stadiums, as do Metallica. Rammstein and Nine Inch Nails play arenas. There's nothing un-metal about it.
