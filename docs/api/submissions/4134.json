He needs to leave mommy out of it. If he always runs to mommy when he doesn't like what you say, then he is a child and needs rules. \n2. Mommy needs to know to stay out of your business. \n3. You tripped over a toy and fell down the steps because he doesn't like baby gates. What does he not understand about how severe injuries can be when (adult or child) falls down the steps?

You know he hates the word rules, but you use it anyways making him feel like less than.  It's not that hard to rephrase and use terms like an agreement (but you two actually have to agree) or safety policy.  You are failing to see you were wrong to be rushing near stairs.  Kids will leave stuff around and that is going to get even more prevalent as your kids get older.  YOU need to watch where you walk and YOU need to act safely around stairs.  Stairs can be slipped on without toys there.  He was wrong to go to his mother and she was wrong to contact you.", "YTA - how hard is it for you to look where you\u2019re going. You are deflecting your negligence on him. He\u2019s a SAHP and has kids most of the time so knows how to raise them. It seems you are feeling left out and said those things to make him look negligent.", "I don't think you're an ass here... But, (and this is just my opinion) it's harder for man to be stay at home parent than it is for woman. You were right to ask him to use the gate for the safety reasons. But maybe...

Not to mention, I wouldn\u2019t be going 50/50 on housework with a spouse who doesn\u2019t work.  Maybe his Mom could do that too.", "Isn\u2019t it obvious? The husband can\u2019t open the gates, he\u2019s still a toddler who needs his mom.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It really is no joke.", "for being mad that her husband refuses to use the baby gate on the stairs?", "I'm a fan. You got my vote!", "Baby gates don't protect mothers from falling down the stairs.\nShe must watch her steps. Does she even know, why the toys were there? She just needed to blame someone, as she is a person who knows everything and her husband, who actually takes care of the children all day long, needs direction.\nHer attitude is wuite sexist.", "If he doesn't want to feel like a kid don't run off to mommy. She fell down the stairs because he doesn't do common sense things like put the baby gate. His mother saying its fine the kids are fine so what. What would she say if the kids fell down the stairs instead without the baby gate. Probably blame the wife.\n\nEdit: I didn't realize she as pregnant wtf is wrong with your husband!!", "The toy was on the stairs because her husband doesn\u2019t find it pertinent to keep the children away from the stairs. The baby gate actually being used wild prevent the children from being able to play with their toys on the stairs. Given that OP uses the baby gate, the only reason that the kids would be able to have their toys on the stairs would be their father\u2019s refusal to use the baby gate.", "NTA I don\u2019t get him. The world \u201crule\u201d\nMakes him feel like less of a man\u2026.but he runs to mommy when you tell him to use the baby gate? Because that makes him look like less if a man. He should use the baby gate because the kids are only okay *now*. Maybe he\u2019ll feel like even less of a man when they tumble down the stairs and he knows it\u2019s his fault", "You are NTA, and his failure to follow basic safety procedures put you at serious risk. Then he fails to take responsibility and then goes crying to his mom, who starts texting you? \n\nGet some marriage counseling, and in the meantime, start keeping track of things in case this goes south. \n\nWhen he makes digs like, \"Am I allowed to...\" you might respond \"I don't know, will it potentially kill me next time?\" It seems like he is functionally unable to distinguish between arbitrary rules/power games and fundamental safety guidelines. This is very concerning.", "You should tell your husband that it isn't the rules or the word \"rules\" that makes him feel like a child. It's his childish ass attitude. Way to prove his own point running to mommy.\n\nNTA", "NTA He is literally a mommy's boy trying to be defiant because you're a woman requesting him to do perfectly reasonable things to keep everyone safe. I cannot believe he threw around the term \"man of the house\" there is no man of the house, there are two grown adults who manage a household and he is lacking on his part of it intentionally. As a result, there was a consequence for you that could have been much worse. He needs to check that ego and also keep in mind you are carrying his fucking child and he should want something like this to never happen to you.", "NTA. I had a friend fall down a flight of stairs not even that far and break his leg in two places. Absolutely shattered the bone and he had a rod and metal cage for eight months around his leg. It\u2019s very easy to be seriously injured on stairs as an adult \u2014 never mind the one year old ??", "So the \"man of the house\" gets to make the rules everyone else lives by? He's mad you're \"usurping\" his position? Gross. NTA", "Come on!

I deal with 100% of the nonsense, though. Doesn't sound like OP's husband is a nonsense-queller."]}
