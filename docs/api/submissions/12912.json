We're a mixture of white trash and East LA Latino... there's a lot of us, because stereotypes exist for a reason.)\n\nMy grandma's brother was exiled from the family when she was in her teens because of some tiff his wife got into with my grandma. My great-grandma threw her husband out for talking to said brother, so my great-grandma tried to throw him out, but he didn't have anywhere to go, so he actually just lived in the cellar for a few years. She still fed him, but wouldn't let him in the house or acknowledge him in front of family. Then there's the slew of cousins I asked about, and all of them just drop off the face of the planet at some point. My grandpa said it's because his mom ALSO tossed people out of the family. And when my family moved west, several generations ago, they just straight up stranded people in towns from Alabama to Nebraska. Like, you upset the matriarch? You're not in the family anymore. But the diaries... oh man. My grandpa had a ton of diaries from generations ago, and they write about it like, \"Archie was a nice guy, but he questioned Momma... and Momma got us up to leave early the next morning.
