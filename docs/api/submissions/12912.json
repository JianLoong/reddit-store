This post concerns my oldest cousin (37M). We\u2019ll call him Greg.\n\nSince they\u2019re family and it was a very chill, spontaneous visit, and since I prioritize comfort over anything else when I know it wouldn\u2019t be inappropriate to do so, I wore a sweatshirt and some plaid pajama pants, thinking no one would care.\n\nFor the most part I was right, and I even got a compliment on my pj pants from my aunt who loves pajamas and comfortable clothes as much as I do. But when Greg sat down next to me on the couch, he started telling me I shouldn\u2019t be wearing things like that outside my house.\n\nHe first told me I\u2019ll \u201cnever get a boyfriend\u201d if I leave the house in pajama pants. I told him I\u2019m not trying to get a boyfriend. He asked me where exactly I wear them out, and I said around family, to friends\u2019 places, on quick trips to convenience stores, and sometimes to morning classes (as do half of my classmates). It also took every ounce of mental fortitude not to tell him I\u2019m really not looking for potential boyfriends at family get-togethers. He said \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help you. Guys will never be interested in you if you dress like that.\u201d I told him if a guy doesn\u2019t want me because I enjoy wearing pajama pants out sometimes then obviously I\u2019m not interested in him either.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t letting up and I was getting pissed so I essentially just told him I\u2019m going to wear what I want and there\u2019s not a damn thing he can do about it and left the conversation. That side of the family can be old-fashioned sometimes but this was honestly unexpected. Like why do you, a 37-year-old man, feel you must take it upon yourself to ensure the 20-year-old female cousin you see a few times a year at most looks appetizing to the male population?\n\nPerhaps he\u2019d at least have some semblance of a point if I wore pajamas everywhere, including places where it would be bad to do so, but like I said, I don\u2019t. I can safely say I\u2019ve never worn pajamas to a job interview, family celebration, etc. But even then it\u2019s still only about my having to be appealing to hypothetical men for him, so no, he wouldn\u2019t have a point.\n\nI ignored him for the rest of the day and didn\u2019t utter any form of goodbye when it was time to leave. I guess he complained to his mom (my aunt) about my \u201cmassive overreaction\u201d to his \u201cadvice\u201d and would like an apology since he was \u201cjust looking out for me.\u201d My aunt texted all this to my dad, who agrees with me but thinks I should just apologize to smooth things over. I don\u2019t want to do that. Even if it makes things tense with that whole house, since Greg still lives with my aunt and uncle, I don\u2019t feel I should apologize when I was the one subjected to harassment regarding my clothing choices. Besides, it\u2019s not like Greg is some grand authority on the subject. Aside from my aunt and grandmother, he\u2019s never felt the touch of a woman in his life.\n\nSo AITA for not letting this go?\n\nEdit: Two things.\n\n1. I think my dad would\u2019ve reacted differently if my dying grandmother weren\u2019t living with Greg because my aunt is her end-of-life caretaker. As in that house is his only access to his mother. I agree\u2014I do wish he reacted differently, but I\u2019m willing to cut him some slack this time. I\u2019m going to explain the situation to him again, and I think he\u2019ll understand this is maybe serious enough to not back down.\n\n2. I really, really didn\u2019t want to share this, but I also live with severe chronic pain on a daily basis and thus seek maximum comfort whenever possible, including in my clothing choices. So the people commenting everyone sucks here can fuck right off.\n\n3. I have seen a few comments accusing me of rejecting requested judgment, especially regarding edit #2, so allow me to clarify: I asked whether I was an AH for refusing to apologize, not whether I was an AH for wearing pajamas out. I believe I made it quite clear that I\u2019m comfortable with my clothing choices. That is not where I requested judgment.

I wouldn't apologize, I would keep your dad out of it because I understand that he's in an awkward position, and honestly anything I said to my cousin I would happily say in front of his mother so that he can't repeat it adding his own flair.\nI also suffer from chronic pain and autoimmune disorders, sometimes people should just be lucky we are wearing pants at all!", "NTA", "Have your dad tell Greg's mom to tell Greg to apologize to you for being a creep.", "NTA. It\u2019s none of his business whatsoever what you wear. He needs to apologize to you for inserting himself in your business and his creepy-ass lecturing. Since he still lives with mommy, maybe you could lecture him on how to get a girlfriend.", "NTA\nWhat a weirdo and mama boy", "Your cousin, who was almost an adult when you were born, wouldn\u2019t let up about how you should dress to attract a boyfriend at family gatherings. Then he ran to mommy when you defended yourself too aggressively for his liking. Everyone else is right - he\u2019s a creep. NTA", "My standard reply when someone comments on my jammy pants is,  \"Am I covered? Yes. Then I'm not breaking the law.\"", "NTA. Your neck beard cousin sounds like an incel.", "NTA but your cousin was/is. He cornered you with unsolicited advice and wouldn\u2019t stop even after hearing your reasoning, which btw, you were under no obligation to give. Even if you chose to wear pjs at \u201cinappropriate\u201d places it is still your choice on what you wear. Why should you apologize to him? Your reaction was reasonable and not OTT.", "NTA\n\nInvite him over for a movie night\n\nPut on *The 42 Year Old Virgin*", "God how many times women are told to 'apologize to smooth things over' instead of standing their ground. NTA", "NTA.\n\n Read this as \"I GAVE MY COUSIN WHO IS HALF MY AGE UNSOLICITED ADVICE AND SHE ASKED ME TO STOP?!? Yeah, so I totally ignored that and kept telling her she looks too comfortable, and she will never get her prize husband if she keeps at it,  but then she walked away and didn't want to talk to me. Rude. MOMMY MAKE HER SAY SORRY!!!\"\n\nYou are definitely NTA, but Uncle is. You're not obligated to do shit for other people, especially ones that are barely even in your orbit. Tell him to apologize for making you uncomfortable despite your best efforts.", "NTA and in my opinion, unless someone is your boss and you are dressed inappropriately for your job, or you are going somewhere that has an actual dress code, you shouldn't have to apologize to anyone criticizing your clothing, especially when they won't stop. It is your body, your choice of clothing, except for the above two situations.", "NTA. OP, you can wear whatever you want wherever you want. If he has an issue with your dress, that is a HIM issue, not a you issue. \n\nNot sure if he was just uncomfortable with seeing you in that attire, which it hardly sounds like anything provocative, so he is just off and you do not owe him or anyone an apology. \n\nHe is being misogynistic and attempting to push his rules on you where he has no reason to do so. Be comfortable and do what you want.", "NTA  \nOn leaving the conversation:  he said you're wrong, tried to hurt you, you said you didn't care, and still persisted.  If he kept hitting you with his hands, you would have left and no one would think you were in the wrong.  Once we realize \"Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me\" is an attempt to get the insulting person to shut up, we can understand how much words hurt.\n\nSleep pants as are worn nowadays are not real pyjamas and are more modest than some of the leggings / bicycle shorts that some wear.  One day when I had to go the post office (a branch office in a US City of over 300,000), I saw an Indian (as in the subcontinent) wearing pyjamas at the post office.", "My apologies. Your cousin is a nice guy. I\u2019m the oldest cousin in my family and I definitely leave the parenting to my aunts and uncles, it\u2019s not my business, but even if it were, treating a woman like getting a boyfriend is the end all be all goal to life is really backwards and misogynist. MTA.", "Your cousin sounds creepy AF. It's no business of him whether you look attractive or not and there's no reason to dress any less than \"as comfortable as possible\" when you're visiting family and relatives.\n\nYou should've told him that line about not looking to hook up ****at a family get-together**** though.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I have *never* in my life left the house wearing pajamas, and I really don't understand people who do. That being said, it's your choice, and your cousin sounds like a mansplaining creep.", "NTA. I am a chronic pain patient and years ago (when I was in my late teens/early 20s) I did wear pajama pants everywhere I could because normal pants caused me pain. So I get it.", "The advice of a grown man who's still living at home trying to convince his 20 year-old-cousin to pander to the male gaze is not advice worth listening to. He's also sexualizing you, which is creepy af.", "NTA\n\nApologize.  \n\n\u201cBless your heart. I am soooo sorry that my choice of clothing offended you. I was totally unaware of your extreme sensitivity regarding what you consider improper attire in your much younger relatives. If had had thought for even a minute that you would be so thoroughly scandalized by what I thought was common (albeit, very causal) attire, I would have chosen something else to wear or made my excuses and stayed home. I would never want to offend someone with as delicate and refined sensibilities as you have shown yourself to have.\u201d", "NTA but if your grandmother is dying and apologising would make the situation better just for her sake I would do it (don't think she fucking cares but no beef during dying time I guess?)", "NTA.  But I\u2019d be concerned about the grown man living in his moms basement who feels comfortable openly sexualizing a cousin young enough to be his child at a family gathering.   It\u2019s not your job to be attractive to him, that\u2019s just creepy.", "NTA I've worn full on pajamas to Christmas morning get together with family.", "Omfg. People are commenting esh?? I'm not even going to read the comments. \n\nI agree with everything you said. Greg is gross and entitled and probably has a crush on you and was looking forward to seeing you in cute clothes. His mom enables him. Your dad isn't far behind. \n\nPlease do not apologize. \n\nYou just keep on wearing whatever the hell you want wherever the hell you want and IF there's a guy out there good enough for you, he'll find you, pajama pants and all. And you can decide then if you're interested.\n\nGreg is acting like an asshole. That would be sexual harassment if it happened at work, why is it any different coming from a cousin 17 yrs older than you? It's gross. \n\nYou have a lot of years ahead of dealing with men who don't respect women (sounds like some are commenting here!). Don't question your worth. You deserve respect no matter how many people in your life tell you otherwise. You don't need them to agree or give you permission.\n\nI would text Greg and let him know that if HE would like to apologize to YOU for his harassment and rude behavior, he has your number. \n\nNo matter how many family dinners are made awkward by you not tolerating your cousin's disrespect and harassment, this will never be on you. It's on him and everyone who would rather demand apologies from you than call out his rude behavior. \n\nActually, if none of these people believe you have the right to dress yourself or expect respect, why even go over there at all? You're 20 and the choices are all yours now.", "NTA\n\nNot at all.\n\nAnd you do not need to apologize to smooth things over. He has no business making your every living moment about a hunt for male companionship. There are many more important things in life, if you even have an interest in romance. With dudes.\n \nAnd we all know he wouldn't have said the same to a male nephew in sweats. \n\nHis views are outdated, misogynistic, OUT OF PLACE (because even if it was true, it's not his job to comment!)\nAND he's WRONG.", "NTA at all -- why on earth would it matter how sexually attractive you look at a family gathering?\n\nYou are allowed to get angry when a man harasses you, regardless of his status in the family. It's not like you got mad at him after a single comment, either. He had to WORK for it.", "I legitimately love seeing people wearing their pjs to the store. I don't because I like heavy clothes like work jeans but they're always so comfy looking and colorful. I've worn sweat pants as pajamas for about 20 years and I've been considering getting proper ones.", "NTA. \n\n\"I'm sorry you actually think you have any right to comment on my choice of clothing, my social life, or my romantic life, because you don't.\"", "OP, you are not at fault! Wear the dang pjs. If you do feel like an apology would smooth things over, do the non-apology \"I'm sorry your were upset over what I wear, but I'm not changing.\"", "NTA.  \n\nNo one gets to tell you how to dress.  I am with you on comfort.  I wear pajama pants to walk my dog in the morning, and if someone doesn't like that, they don't have to look.", "Creepy and sexualizing his 17 year younger cousin!\n\nEeeeew!\n\nYes he was sexualizing her as he was considering how appealing (sexy!) she is to men", "I think you meant her cousin but yeah, I agree.", "His mommy with whom he still lives, no less!", "Greg is single and we all know why....", "Of course he would. He still lives with her. I think he needs to be more concerned about his own relationship prospects based on the info we\u2019ve been given.\nNTA.", "I always thought, what he has, was called peter pan syndrome.  NTA", "Love this comment, thank you!!", "Lol it sort of is\u2026 depends on the pajama bottoms honestly. I\u2019d say plaid ones are what I see most. I saw another comment say that for some people it\u2019s a sort of fashion statement these days.", "Part of the reason I was so shocked is because my family does the same thing\u2014every Christmas Eve get-together, every single one of us shows up in pajamas. Greg included.", "Felt more like \"MOMMY! My cousin half my age didn't immediately thank me for creepily telling her no one wants her with how she dresses after I got up in her face about it WHAAAAAAA!\"", "Definitely! And would 100% hang out with you in whatever you chose to wear, wherever you chose and not think a thing of it! So inappropriate of him.", "Yeah def plaid everywhere at the university lol. Thanks for letting me know!", "So I'm 38 and I don't think it's weird AT ALL. I frequently wore pajama pants to class in high school/college and when pregnant live in fleece or yoga pants. Oh, and I'm married and expecting our second kid. If a guy doesn't want you because of a reason that superficial you probably wouldn't want them either.", "Not sure someone ask his mommy?", "You hit the bullseye with that one, but for the sake of my brain I wish you hadn't. Feel like throwing up.", "Happily single upper 30's here. You'd be surprised that \"stable job, housing, and transportation,\" is still asking too much for a lot of adult males.", "Yes! Exactly the right \u201cF you\u201d non apology."]}
