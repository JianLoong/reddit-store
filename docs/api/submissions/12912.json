And yea Greg scares me now", "\ud83d\ude02 Red flag superstore!  I\u2019ll have to use that!", "That\u2019s what I was trying to gauge. It seems most people here think so.", "Yes it is, because this guy is at best being insensitive and not minding his business, and at worst he\u2019s not so secretly perving on his 17 years younger female cousin", "He is indeed.", "I was so beyond uncomfortable that I think I sort of just froze a little.", "Not only red flags but how dare he give advice on how to get in a relationship when he can't get into one himself.", "It's just a habit my family has. I got really into genealogy for a while when my grandparents were still alive, and the stories are ridiculous.\n\n(EDIT: I should clarify here - in my family you're a cousin if you can't drink, and an uncle or aunt if you can drink. We're a mixture of white trash and East LA Latino... there's a lot of us, because stereotypes exist for a reason.)\n\nMy grandma's brother was exiled from the family when she was in her teens because of some tiff his wife got into with my grandma. My great-grandma threw her husband out for talking to said brother, so my great-grandma tried to throw him out, but he didn't have anywhere to go, so he actually just lived in the cellar for a few years. She still fed him, but wouldn't let him in the house or acknowledge him in front of family. Then there's the slew of cousins I asked about, and all of them just drop off the face of the planet at some point. My grandpa said it's because his mom ALSO tossed people out of the family. And when my family moved west, several generations ago, they just straight up stranded people in towns from Alabama to Nebraska. Like, you upset the matriarch? You're not in the family anymore. But the diaries... oh man. My grandpa had a ton of diaries from generations ago, and they write about it like, \"Archie was a nice guy, but he questioned Momma... and Momma got us up to leave early the next morning. She did not wake Archie.\" And then we never hear about Archie again. My family is whack. Lol.", "While he's living at home and not dating yet. At 37. \n\n*shudder*", "NTA. I would tell him that his opinion is not important to you because you are not trying to attract a man like him. You don't want a 37 year old man that lives with his parents and thinks women should dress to please a man.", "To me you showed the point. I'd let it go but still have zero tolerance for cuz", "They're not going to be affected by the fallout though, so you're going to get very extreme advice at times. You can be right, and still keep the peace without compromising your integrity. It's a great skill to have, actually", "If I were you i would talk to your aunt and tell her exactly what happened. He probably didnt give her the full picture.", "That is absolutely fascinating. Imagine reading those diaries. I'd love to hear more stories from you.", "Lol I\u2019d watch a show about this"]}
