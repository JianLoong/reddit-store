We come from different backgrounds and my family is considered \u201cwell off\u201d while his isn\u2019t. He has even pointed out how this bothered him during the first year of our relationship, but this has never been a problem for me. \n\nLast weekend, I was out with his family and everyone got brownies. My boyfriend, who knew how much I loved walnut brownies, got me those in place of plain ones. They only cost like a dollar more and I payed for them. His older brother immediately rolled his eyes and whispered something to him that I couldn\u2019t hear. \n\nLater when I got home, I asked him about it, he said his brother basically made a comment about me thinking that I\u2019m \u201ctoo good\u201d and \u201ctoo rich\u201d for plain brownies. I asked him if that was supposed to be a joke and he says it\u2019s not. I asked him why he didn\u2019t say anything in my defense and he says it\u2019s better to just leave it and not make a big deal about it. \n\nIf this was the first time something like this happened, I\u2019d agree but it\u2019s not. I told him I\u2019m tired of these comments since his family always picks the weirdest things to criticize me about. \n\nHis sister in law (married to another brother) still hasn\u2019t gotten over the fact that I once didn\u2019t tell her good morning right away, years ago, and considers me rude despite me trying to make it up for years. The brother she\u2019s married to once \u201cjokingly\u201d said that I\u2019m with my bf for the citizenship. I was born in the US and am a citizen. I once got a splitter embedded under skin at his house and almost cried cause I was in pain before I could get it out and they all rolled their eyes and told me I was overreacting and acting \u201ctoo soft\u201d and \u201cspoiled\u201d. His mom once told me I was acting too \u201cprivileged\u201d for saying I\u2019d prefer to drive my own car to a wedding because theirs had a bad habit of breaking down and having doors get stuck. \n\nI brought all this up and told him they\u2019re constantly trying to nitpick everything I do or say and act like they don\u2019t like me and that he could at least admit that they haven\u2019t always treated me fairly and always make snarky remarks. He got mad and insisted they\u2019ve always been nice and said I was making too much of a big deal.\n\nI understand brownies that cost a dollar more are a ridiculous thing to fight over but I was hurt that he couldn\u2019t even acknowledge his family is a bit hostile to me cause it feels like he agrees with them when he excuses their actions. \n\nMy bf\u2019s now mad and insisting I\u2019m being too sensitive and that I should let it be and get over it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673020104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104xg2t/aita_for_wanting_my_bf_to_acknowledge_his_family/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mentioned your bf 'had trouble' with your family's financial status FOR A YEAR? Yeah, he's still having trouble if he can't stand up to his family members rude comments.

That this has gone on long enough.  That he is happy being in a relationship with someone from your background but since he supports his family in trying to make you feel bad for your background.   That he can't be in a relationship and know who you really are and think it's ok for his family to project their own insecurities onto you, to make them feel better about themselves.  You deserve more respect than that after all these years.

You will be the AH if after 5 years together you recognize this, and don\u2019t do anything about this.  \n\nI (64F) am sure you go out of your way to be liked by people.  You are a people pleaser for what ever reason.  This is not sustainable.  I was taught that you treat others how you want to be treated, expecting others to know this. Being the people pleaser that I am, always wanting to be liked by everyone, I lost myself for years. I was too afraid to stand up for myself, and tell people when they hurt my feelings because I didn\u2019t want to hurt them. I became a doormat. I became the whipping boy. I became the dumping ground that family members would say stuff to that they would never, ever, ever say to anybody else and think that it was OK.  And then I would be the one to apologize for making them angry. This is not sustainable. I sustained till I was 62 and a hollow shell.  You don\u2019t want to grow up to be a pissed off old person.  \n\nThink much more highly of yourself than you are right now. It\u2019s not being proud and rich and thinking you\u2019re better than anyone else, it\u2019s self respect.  If your boyfriend cannot stand up for you to his family after five years together and into his 20s, this will not get better as time goes by trust me.  \n\nYou will be/are (if you have siblings) a role model, especially if you have kids.

You have a partner who prefers to let his family disrespect, mock, criticize and emotionally abuse you rather than stand up for you.\n\nAre you ok with a lifetime of this kind of treatment? \n\nAre you ok being with someone who is incapable of setting boundaries with people who clearly treat you poorly? I hope he never has kids because kids need rules and boundaries and consequences and he is showing that he has no ability to do any of that.\n\nAre you ok with someone who excuses other people for treating you with hostility and expects you to lie down and take it so that he can avoid a confrontation?", "Just 'let that (boyfriend) be'.", "NTA.

And he has made no attempt to defend you to his family for 5 whole years? I honestly think at this point he never will. Is it possible that he still isn't over the difference in background between the two of you? Cause it sounds like when they call you spoiled and entitled a part of him agrees. Why else would he be okay with his family calling you those names?", "With a gossipy tight-knit family, you're basically being tested every way you turn, and it's not fair for them to compound offenses. I'd have spouted something back or started being petty by repeating things they've said about me in front of them, but kudos for not.\n\nTbh, I think the main AH here is your bf for playing both sides. Your bf needs to tell you why his family feels this way and the little things you might be doing to offend them, but more importantly, tell them they need to stop talking shit ESPECIALLY in front of you.\n\nI think you might do little things that offend them. Like not riding with them to a wedding because their car isn't as reliable. Tbh, my family would be upset if an in-law declined a nice gesture because what my family has isn't quality enough for you regardless of why. Not saying good morning on top of using your own things instead of theirs could come off like you feel like you're better than them as a person, too, esp if they already don't like you.\n\nYour bf needs to stop closing his eyes and plugging his ears to this situation where obvious tension is. The only one that benefits from him doing that is himself, and that's why he does it. I'm surprised it hasn't resulted in more. BF needs to get his shit together and fix the problem before it gets worse.", "NTA your bf should have your side, if not think again this relationship. It will be worse with children.

Will he defend potential future children against his family calling them spoiled brats?  Five years is long enough past the honeymoon stage- he is showing you that he AGREES with them, despite the fact that he benefits from you paying for him. How do you want to be treated? Because of this isn't it- cut ties and move about your life.", "NTA, this is only going to get worse over time. If he refuses to even acknowledge it, you'll likely be miserable every time you're around them and come to resent your SO more and more.

Or wants to isolate you from your child because the child is family but you're still not accepted?", "NTA but it\u2019s never going to happen.

I know that in the past my FIL was horribly abusive to my MIL, my husband and my brother in law (BIL), but really can't be anymore... he's not only too old, but my husband and BIL took it upon themselves to put a stop to it many years ago.\n\nThat being said, both MIL and FIL have been good to me and our kids. I've called them both out for being obnoxious to not only each other, but to others as well though. My husband says things too, but for some reason, his comments or requests seem to go largely ignored even though they are HIS parents... so I never have an issue with speaking up. When my BIL and his wife had nasty things to say about me, my husband ABSOLUTELY stuck up for me and that was before we were married.\n\nYour BF either needs to grow a pair or you find someone that is better for you. You being treated differently because of your financial status or your race is bullcrap. \n\nMy son is 14, but already has preferences to the darker ladies and there's nothing wrong with that AT ALL. His one friend is Mexican and I LOVE her and her family \\[her mom and I get along very well and hang out together when we can\\]... they're not as financially stable as my husband and I are \\[we are not well off either\\], but we help each other with things like they'll get kids to school and I pick them up and the kids all hang out at my house until my friend gets home from work and I'll take her daughter back home. I usually feed her before taking her back home... it helps my friend out. That's how families should act.

Nothing you can do is going to change that. \n\nYour boyfriend is not going to see their ugly little resentments as anything other than harmless -- even when it plainly harms you. He is, psychologically, still identifying much more strongly as a subordinate of his elders, and on some level, their emotional states are more important to him than his romantic partner's emotional states.\n\nNow that you know this -- do *you* think you deserve a partner who has made it clear he doesn't care if you remain outside his family's circle?", "Siding with family against a long term partner rarely bodes well for the longevity of a relationship.", "Given the citizenship joke, are you a different race?", "Not financially but emotionally, I think. \n\nHe did admit that he hates confrontation and especially hates confronting his brothers.

His avoiding confrontation is not healthy for him, but his inaction is affecting you too. \n\nThe fact that he won\u2019t even admit it privately is weird. Maybe he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable having conversations that could possibly paint his family in a negative light? Whatever the case that\u2019s problematic.
