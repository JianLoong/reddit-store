There\u2019s a variety of trails with varying degrees on mileage and incline. I go to these to walk or run in line with my training program or just for fun. \n\nI have a friend who I\u2019ve known and been close with since middle school. Recently, he has asked to come along on these for some exercise. I was fine with this, until he asked if his girlfriend could come along. I didn\u2019t know her well but I accepted and it was a fine time.\n\nBut then she began coming to all of the trail walks. I usually wouldn\u2019t care, but she ends up complaining a lot, and needing breaks. I would be ok with this except it would be less than a mile in and she would continue to stop our group intermittently even when we tried to keep a specific pace. When I would try to keep going she made comments about me being inconsiderate. Often the walks/runs were ~3 miles.\n\nI explained the problem to my friend, that if we wanted to keep this up, she needed to be prepared or not come at all. In all honesty I don\u2019t know if she was inviting herself or if my friend was inviting her but regardless I make my intention with this clear. He said he would talk but that was 2 weeks ago.\n\nYesterday, I was planning on going on a long hike, about 6 miles with a lot of hills and a couple cliff-like areas. I made it clear I was looking for a specific pace when I asked my friend if he wanted to come, and he accepted, even mentioning that his gf was busy. I thought all was fine.\n\nWhen we met at the parking lot, I saw that his girlfriend ended up coming anyways. I was not in the mood to be stopping but I assumed she would be doing a much easier/shorter trail. When I asked her, said she was doing ours.\n\nI will admit I was a bit curt/ fed up when I spoke, but I straight up asked her if she would be able to do it or if she would need a break every 5 minutes like previous times. She got immediately offended, and asked me if I was serious. I simply recalled each time we had a walk in the same group and reaffirmed that I was serious. When my friend looked at me, I asked him if he really thought she could make the full trail when she struggled with a low incline, 2.5 mile walk last time.\n\nShe called me an asshole and went and sat in their car, waiting for my friend I assume. I just started the trail and my friend followed. He didn\u2019t say anything about it, except a \u201csorry about that\u201d, and he turned off his phone. \n\nAm I wrong for questioning her? Or should I have let her come, but deal with the consequences. I admit I struggle with being a little too honest at times, but I feel that this time could be reasonable? But I\u2019m not sure.", "created_utc": 1690503373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bi3rh/aita_for_suggesting_my_friends_girlfriend_is_not/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend either lied to you initially or the girlfriend shamed him into including her. He\u2019s the real problem.", "NTA. You set the expectations for your trip. If she is unable or unwilling to keep up, then that's on her. You shouldn't have to keep stopping if she doesn't have the conditioning to keep up.", "NTA - OP was specific about what he wanted and what his plans were. He was polite and spoke to his friend about it. You can't have one person slow down a whole group. GF is entitled. Her BF is an AH for leaving her in the car for a 6 mile hike though!", "NTA but your buddy is.\n\nIf you were being like this to your own GF, I'd be like, yep, 100%, you're the asshole. But this isn't your GF. It's your buddy's, and you did ask him to let her know you're doing a harder hike and aren't up for frequent breaks and belly aching.\n\nI mean, I bitch a lot on hikes. I do a lot of hard ones, so I'm pretty fit, plus I'm competitive in some sports. But I like to bitch. If that doesn't suit the people I'm hiking with, they're welcome to tell me to fuck off. Except my wife, she's stuck with me.\n\nBut, like I said, she's not your responsibility. I can get her being miffed if you were rude to her face, but you did set the expectation and it seems like your buddy did not communicate it well to her.\n\nSo I don't think she's quite the AH here, because there may be a misunderstanding between her and the BF. And leaving your GF in the car while you go and do something fun *and then turning off his phone* is totally the asshole move. But that's not your business.\n\nIn any case, $10 she breaks up with him over him being a jerk so none of this is your problem anymore.", "NTA. Each person hiking needs to be capable or it can put everyone at risk. Including beginners is great if it is a beginner level hike. More difficult hikes require skill and endurance. From her previous outings she didn\u2019t demonstrate either. Taking her could have put your own safety at risk.", "NTA but just stop calling this dude for your hikes.", "NTA - but you might need to stop inviting your friend if he's going to always bring his girlfriend who clearly doesn't want to take the hike seriously.", "NTA. You know you weren't because your friend turned off his phone.", "NTA- it\u2019s also probably healthy to set the boundary/expectation of \u201chey, I\u2019m going at x pace, if you can\u2019t keep up we can catch up later\u201d", "NTA. You\u2019re there to get a workout and it\u2019s not like there\u2019s unlimited time in the day to do that. Your friend is TA for wasting your exercise time and forcing your hand into saying something when you spoke to him privately about it to spare his girlfriend\u2019s feelings. This is an issue between them and he\u2019s rude for putting you in the middle of it.", "NTA, and your friend is probably in a very unhealthy relationship. Sounds like he knows it too.", "NTA. Maybe there can be times where you do the very easy trails for your friend and his girlfriend (if you want, you don't have to) but this is your thing, you want to do the trails you want to do, and she clearly isn't up for them. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's unfair for her to think that you're going to adjust to her pace every time you go out.", "You\u2019re probably going to get a lot of yta but I\u2019m actually going to say NTA. It\u2019s very frustrating when someone ruins something you like doing, you shouldn\u2019t have to waste your time waiting around for someone that can\u2019t keep up", "Nta, I mean you kinda sound like an ass,  but seems reasonable here", "NTA. She needs to understand her limitations, if she wants to come with you that bad then she should come on shorter trails and that too every once in a while, not every fucking time.", "NTA . Given your friend just left with you I would guess the relationship isn't in a good place. She may well have been inviting herself along.\n\nBut for relevancy, it's acceptable to expect the people you do an activity with, to also be able to perform the activity.\n\nIt's okay for this woman to have a different competency and fitness level. But what isn't okay is to insist on coming on EVERY hike without considering if she can even do it whilst keeping up with you guys.\n\nAs an overweight person myself I'd openly expect you to go ahead of me. Organise to meet up at a certain point in the trail or even at the end for a break/lunch or whatever.", "NTA\n\nIf she struggled before, she definitely would've struggled this time. I used to love walking long distances before I got Covid. I can't manage it now which might be a combination of Long Covid and age and there's no way I'd hike even 2 miles on the flat now. Well, maybe but with many breaks. If I did I wouldn't tag along with people who like to stride ahead because it would ruin their hike. The way your friend said 'sorry about that' makes me think he'd already had the conversation with her but she'd insisted anyway. Maybe to show there's no hard feelings do a softies walk with him and her (and maybe an elderly woman!) and take a picnic.", "NTA\n\nYou're not suggesting anything that isn't already a fact. Her denial doesn't change the fact that she can't handle your hikes. Maybe you should stop inviting your friend if he can't go without his girlfriend having to tag along.", "NTA your friend's girlfriend is super annoying (not to mention lazy as f, from the sound of it). Your friend is a wuss for not managing his gf's attitude & interference with the pace of the hikes. Could you have handled this better? Yes, but you were specifically told she *would not* be there, so you were understandably frustrated. I'd advise you to make a heartfelt apology for being rude, as it's better than permanently losing a friend or alienating his significant other.", "NTA but I don't think you care about her fitness. I think you care that she took something from you (the hikes you were doing with your homie). You and your homie need to have an honest chat.", "NTA.\n\nIf she insists on tagging along, when she needs her multiple rests, her bf can stay behind with her while you continue at your preferred pace. It was fine to give her a break the first time or two, but now she's hijacking your hike. If she can't keep up, she needs to find a slower hiking partner.", "ESH. Not for being angry, or for expecting courtesy from the people who you take with you, but for how you went about it.\n\nThere's many ways to figure it out, and one of them is saying \"I'm sorry but I didn't realize you were coming. I have a set time I can do this trail so I can't stop, but you guys can go at your own pace. It's ok if you guys need a breather but due to my own time constraints/needs I'm going to go on ahead.\" then go on ahead as planned. \n\nYou also should be angry at your trail partner for never giving you the courtesy of a heads up about the extra person. You both should be choosing paths that works for her * ONLY IF* you both agreed to take her beforehand and have already decided it's ok to be a snail on some baby trails for her to build up to your guys level. It's not on you to stoop to beginner level stuff without warning just to accommodate a self-invited guest (even if the friend is who invited her)\n\nLast thing: if your friend continues to show up with her being an unannounced guest, stop inviting him.\n\nEdited for more accurate ESH vote instead of  yta", "nta, your friend is the asshole to BOTH you and her", "ESH - You certainly could have handled the situation better. Your friend sucks because he clearly hasn't had the discussion with her. She sucks because she is clearly taking the enjoyment out of something that you enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe to rectify the situation, you should go one some lower intensity hikes and help her build her endurance so that she is able to do better on the more intense tracks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\\* To clarify why everyone sucks - if somebody who is clearly a beginner wishes to join in with people who are clearly more advanced, they should recognize this and expect in some cases to keep up or not hinder the others. Equally, the more advanced participants should allow lenience and cater a couple of activities for the beginner to take part and improve.", "YTA; She knows her endurance, you don't need to shame her and place your friend in this bind.\n\nI need to ask are you male or female (or non binary)?", "lowkey ESH. girlfriend should have the sensitivity and social awareness that she's slowing everyone down. once or twice would be okay but if it's every single time, she should have noticed that the group is more experienced and for the amount of times she went on the hikes, she should have been able to gauge her capabilities. boyfriend should have talked to her like he promised. OP could have talked to her directly and politely (with the permission of boyfriend who is clearly afraid of confrontation).", "ESH except her. Altho I don't blame you for wanting to go without her you were an ass about it. She's out there doing the trails trying to get in better shape. No that doesn't mean you need to go with her but this is on your friend not her. He let her come knowing what was expected of that hike. Then he took off leaving her behind? You both such and she did noting wrong.", "YTA and so is your friend. \n\nYour friend is TA because you explained to him your issue, and he clearly did not relay this to his gf. Which would have solved the problem.\n\nYou're TA for unleashing on the gf and not the boyfriend for being a spineless weenie.", "YTA", "My dog had double fangs on all 4 teeth.

She called OP inconsiderate when he wanted to keep going and not wait for her on earlier hikes.", "Because she can open the car door and get out if she starts overheating, plus eat and drink whatever she brought for the hike. She can also call someone to get her. Dogs can't do any of those things.", "Um, because she\u2019s\u2026.a human? With opposable thumbs?

You call being thrown a verbal list of your own failures being straightforward? Being straightforward to me is more of a \" listen,based on your hiking experience this isn't a hike for you.

Everyone in the hiking community agrees: you have to go at the pace of the slowest hiker.  That's just pragmatic as well as kind and polite.\n\nBut you explicitly have said that this is a fitness hike that you do for training.  She is not able to keep a pace that tracks with your doing the hikes for fitness.\n\nThe one who SHOULD have made this clear to her is her boyfriend, who is the jerk.  You are NTA for having your fitness hikes hijacked by a slower/beginning hiker whom you uninvited through her boyfriend.  Your friend is definitely the jerk here.  He should have left with her (or done a beginner trail with her) rather than leave her sitting in the car.  Further, he should have communicated with her that she wasn't welcome on this hike because she wasn't fast enough.  He's the jerk.  I hope she leaves him after stewing in the car.\n\nYou were not wrong for questioning her after it was clear on prior hikes that she wasn't up to a hike of this difficulty.  She might not understand why you didn't just do an easier hike, but for her this seems to be more about spending time with someone she cares about than it is about fitness.  I hope you made it clear to her that your jerk friend KNEW that this was going to be a more difficult hike at a higher intensity and quicker pace.", "I think yta \n\nAs far as we/you know, she isn't aware you specifically told your friend that you were looking to keep a certain pace, or that reaching the objective or reaching it in a certain time was more important than spending time on the trail with friends, or that she wasn't invited \n\nOnce she's already driven out to the wilderness probably isn't the time to act as if she had all the information about your priorities and held a gun to your friend's head to force him to drag her along. \n\nI feel like the real conversation should have been with your friend (after the hike), since he's the one you've been communicating to about your goals for hiking. Why did he invite her? Why didn't he explain you had a fitness goal for the hike and it wasnt an appropriate couple activity? If it was so important that they had to spend the time together that day and that time, why did he just show up without informing you he'd had an emergency change of plans? What the Hell happened to that \"talk\" they were supposed to have? It seems like he chickened out or wasn't sure how to confront her about it.\n\nStop inviting your friend on hikes if he's ruining them because he can't communicate properly with his girlfriend, or figure out how to split his time between different priorities.

You were a little harsh but it\u2019s understandable to have that frustration after trying to communicate, and also the GF was rude to call you inconsiderate for wanting to go ahead at a certain pace.

It's hard to say who is the bigger asshole between your friend and his girlfriend (turning his phone off and leaving her in his car was pretty awful) without knowing WHY the girlfriend is tagging along. Is she clingy? Is it him who doesn't like doing things without her? Did he even address your concerns with her, or did she not realize her needing to stop was an issue for you? In any case, I think you need to find a new hiking buddy, or just go it alone.\nI'm a hiker myself and only go with someone who is at a similar hiking fitness level.

She had the choice not to go. She chose to go and make a scene after op calmly (but potentially still very unhappily.

These hikes are part of his exercise routine, he's not a coach or the head of a club. And being forced to stop every five minutes disrupts his training.

You are welcome to come at your own pace as far as you can and we'll collect you on the way back.", "NTA \nNah, how you approached this was fine. You covered everything and even asked her if she was sure she could really hike it.

If someone said \"we're going for a 2.5 mile walk\" I would in no way assume that they were aiming for a specific pace, because that's not walking to me. If someone said they'd going for a 6 miles hilly hike I might presume there was an expected level of fitness needed, but again have no real worry about a specific pace because that's not really a thing (as a relatively experienced hiker in the UK) that I'm aware of. Even a very hilly hike can easily be finished in a few hours, so unless you're doing some kind of fell running challenge I don't see why it would make a difference to have an extra 30 mins for more frequent stops. If someone needs to stop after a mile of level walking either they are very unfit, or you aren't walking. You clearly think you're being clear to her that she's not able to do these activities, but perhaps from her perspective you're being overly strict on timings for no obvious reason?", "NTA\n\nIt might help to set a difficulty level in the invitations. Maybe as simple as red/amber/green. Or just state the steepest grade, if there is any climbing/scrambling, and planned average pace.\n\nThat way everyone can determine if they want to do this hike.\n\nPerhaps try doing an inclusive hike once a month. Not too fast, not too steep, no planned pace. Bring sandwiches, eat them at a lookout. That way gf can join once in a while without slowing you down.

When you meet up, be sure to stop a while so they can rest, too. Often the faster hikers have already rested by the time the slower ones catch up, so they think it's time to go again. Plan for a longer break.\n* If there is more than one trail to the same spot, have the weaker ones take the easier trail and the stronger ones take the harder one, and meet at the designated spot.\n* Walk to something cool, where people want to hang out for a while anyhow, so if you're waiting on someone, you are still having fun.\n* Make sure there is more than one person at each level, so the fasties can be together and the slowies as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I think you need to be more clear about doing a walk with JUST your friend. If he never can be alone, then find another hiking buddy if you can't find a friend for the GF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut don't discourage the GF with your snide remarks.
