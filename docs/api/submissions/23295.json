There\u2019s a variety of trails with varying degrees on mileage and incline. I go to these to walk or run in line with my training program or just for fun. \n\nI have a friend who I\u2019ve known and been close with since middle school. Recently, he has asked to come along on these for some exercise. I was fine with this, until he asked if his girlfriend could come along. I didn\u2019t know her well but I accepted and it was a fine time.\n\nBut then she began coming to all of the trail walks. I usually wouldn\u2019t care, but she ends up complaining a lot, and needing breaks. I would be ok with this except it would be less than a mile in and she would continue to stop our group intermittently even when we tried to keep a specific pace. When I would try to keep going she made comments about me being inconsiderate. Often the walks/runs were ~3 miles.\n\nI explained the problem to my friend, that if we wanted to keep this up, she needed to be prepared or not come at all. In all honesty I don\u2019t know if she was inviting herself or if my friend was inviting her but regardless I make my intention with this clear. He said he would talk but that was 2 weeks ago.\n\nYesterday, I was planning on going on a long hike, about 6 miles with a lot of hills and a couple cliff-like areas. I made it clear I was looking for a specific pace when I asked my friend if he wanted to come, and he accepted, even mentioning that his gf was busy. I thought all was fine.\n\nWhen we met at the parking lot, I saw that his girlfriend ended up coming anyways. I was not in the mood to be stopping but I assumed she would be doing a much easier/shorter trail. When I asked her, said she was doing ours.\n\nI will admit I was a bit curt/ fed up when I spoke, but I straight up asked her if she would be able to do it or if she would need a break every 5 minutes like previous times. She got immediately offended, and asked me if I was serious. I simply recalled each time we had a walk in the same group and reaffirmed that I was serious. When my friend looked at me, I asked him if he really thought she could make the full trail when she struggled with a low incline, 2.5 mile walk last time.\n\nShe called me an asshole and went and sat in their car, waiting for my friend I assume. I just started the trail and my friend followed. He didn\u2019t say anything about it, except a \u201csorry about that\u201d, and he turned off his phone. \n\nAm I wrong for questioning her? Or should I have let her come, but deal with the consequences. I admit I struggle with being a little too honest at times, but I feel that this time could be reasonable? But I\u2019m not sure.", "created_utc": 1690503373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bi3rh/aita_for_suggesting_my_friends_girlfriend_is_not/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend either lied to you initially or the girlfriend shamed him into including her. He\u2019s the real problem.", "NTA. You set the expectations for your trip. If she is unable or unwilling to keep up, then that's on her. You shouldn't have to keep stopping if she doesn't have the conditioning to keep up.", "NTA - OP was specific about what he wanted and what his plans were. He was polite and spoke to his friend about it. You can't have one person slow down a whole group. GF is entitled. Her BF is an AH for leaving her in the car for a 6 mile hike though!", "NTA but your buddy is.\n\nIf you were being like this to your own GF, I'd be like, yep, 100%, you're the asshole. But this isn't your GF. It's your buddy's, and you did ask him to let her know you're doing a harder hike and aren't up for frequent breaks and belly aching.\n\nI mean, I bitch a lot on hikes. I do a lot of hard ones, so I'm pretty fit, plus I'm competitive in some sports. But I like to bitch. If that doesn't suit the people I'm hiking with, they're welcome to tell me to fuck off. Except my wife, she's stuck with me.\n\nBut, like I said, she's not your responsibility. I can get her being miffed if you were rude to her face, but you did set the expectation and it seems like your buddy did not communicate it well to her.\n\nSo I don't think she's quite the AH here, because there may be a misunderstanding between her and the BF. And leaving your GF in the car while you go and do something fun *and then turning off his phone* is totally the asshole move. But that's not your business.\n\nIn any case, $10 she breaks up with him over him being a jerk so none of this is your problem anymore.", "NTA. Each person hiking needs to be capable or it can put everyone at risk. Including beginners is great if it is a beginner level hike. More difficult hikes require skill and endurance. From her previous outings she didn\u2019t demonstrate either. Taking her could have put your own safety at risk.", "NTA but just stop calling this dude for your hikes.", "NTA - but you might need to stop inviting your friend if he's going to always bring his girlfriend who clearly doesn't want to take the hike seriously.", "NTA. You know you weren't because your friend turned off his phone.", "NTA- it\u2019s also probably healthy to set the boundary/expectation of \u201chey, I\u2019m going at x pace, if you can\u2019t keep up we can catch up later\u201d", "NTA. You\u2019re there to get a workout and it\u2019s not like there\u2019s unlimited time in the day to do that. Your friend is TA for wasting your exercise time and forcing your hand into saying something when you spoke to him privately about it to spare his girlfriend\u2019s feelings. This is an issue between them and he\u2019s rude for putting you in the middle of it.", "NTA, and your friend is probably in a very unhealthy relationship. Sounds like he knows it too.", "NTA. Maybe there can be times where you do the very easy trails for your friend and his girlfriend (if you want, you don't have to) but this is your thing, you want to do the trails you want to do, and she clearly isn't up for them. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's unfair for her to think that you're going to adjust to her pace every time you go out.", "You\u2019re probably going to get a lot of yta but I\u2019m actually going to say NTA. It\u2019s very frustrating when someone ruins something you like doing, you shouldn\u2019t have to waste your time waiting around for someone that can\u2019t keep up", "Nta, I mean you kinda sound like an ass,  but seems reasonable here", "NTA. She needs to understand her limitations, if she wants to come with you that bad then she should come on shorter trails and that too every once in a while, not every fucking time.", "NTA . Given your friend just left with you I would guess the relationship isn't in a good place. She may well have been inviting herself along.\n\nBut for relevancy, it's acceptable to expect the people you do an activity with, to also be able to perform the activity.\n\nIt's okay for this woman to have a different competency and fitness level. But what isn't okay is to insist on coming on EVERY hike without considering if she can even do it whilst keeping up with you guys.\n\nAs an overweight person myself I'd openly expect you to go ahead of me. Organise to meet up at a certain point in the trail or even at the end for a break/lunch or whatever.", "NTA\n\nIf she struggled before, she definitely would've struggled this time. I used to love walking long distances before I got Covid. I can't manage it now which might be a combination of Long Covid and age and there's no way I'd hike even 2 miles on the flat now. Well, maybe but with many breaks. If I did I wouldn't tag along with people who like to stride ahead because it would ruin their hike. The way your friend said 'sorry about that' makes me think he'd already had the conversation with her but she'd insisted anyway. Maybe to show there's no hard feelings do a softies walk with him and her (and maybe an elderly woman!) and take a picnic.", "NTA\n\nYou're not suggesting anything that isn't already a fact. Her denial doesn't change the fact that she can't handle your hikes. Maybe you should stop inviting your friend if he can't go without his girlfriend having to tag along.", "NTA your friend's girlfriend is super annoying (not to mention lazy as f, from the sound of it). Your friend is a wuss for not managing his gf's attitude & interference with the pace of the hikes. Could you have handled this better? Yes, but you were specifically told she *would not* be there, so you were understandably frustrated. I'd advise you to make a heartfelt apology for being rude, as it's better than permanently losing a friend or alienating his significant other.", "NTA but I don't think you care about her fitness. I think you care that she took something from you (the hikes you were doing with your homie). You and your homie need to have an honest chat.", "NTA.\n\nIf she insists on tagging along, when she needs her multiple rests, her bf can stay behind with her while you continue at your preferred pace. It was fine to give her a break the first time or two, but now she's hijacking your hike. If she can't keep up, she needs to find a slower hiking partner.", "ESH. Not for being angry, or for expecting courtesy from the people who you take with you, but for how you went about it.\n\nThere's many ways to figure it out, and one of them is saying \"I'm sorry but I didn't realize you were coming. I have a set time I can do this trail so I can't stop, but you guys can go at your own pace. It's ok if you guys need a breather but due to my own time constraints/needs I'm going to go on ahead.\" then go on ahead as planned. \n\nYou also should be angry at your trail partner for never giving you the courtesy of a heads up about the extra person. You both should be choosing paths that works for her * ONLY IF* you both agreed to take her beforehand and have already decided it's ok to be a snail on some baby trails for her to build up to your guys level. It's not on you to stoop to beginner level stuff without warning just to accommodate a self-invited guest (even if the friend is who invited her)\n\nLast thing: if your friend continues to show up with her being an unannounced guest, stop inviting him.\n\nEdited for more accurate ESH vote instead of  yta", "nta, your friend is the asshole to BOTH you and her", "ESH - You certainly could have handled the situation better. Your friend sucks because he clearly hasn't had the discussion with her. She sucks because she is clearly taking the enjoyment out of something that you enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe to rectify the situation, you should go one some lower intensity hikes and help her build her endurance so that she is able to do better on the more intense tracks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\\* To clarify why everyone sucks - if somebody who is clearly a beginner wishes to join in with people who are clearly more advanced, they should recognize this and expect in some cases to keep up or not hinder the others. Equally, the more advanced participants should allow lenience and cater a couple of activities for the beginner to take part and improve.", "YTA; She knows her endurance, you don't need to shame her and place your friend in this bind.\n\nI need to ask are you male or female (or non binary)?", "lowkey ESH. girlfriend should have the sensitivity and social awareness that she's slowing everyone down. once or twice would be okay but if it's every single time, she should have noticed that the group is more experienced and for the amount of times she went on the hikes, she should have been able to gauge her capabilities. boyfriend should have talked to her like he promised. OP could have talked to her directly and politely (with the permission of boyfriend who is clearly afraid of confrontation).", "ESH except her. Altho I don't blame you for wanting to go without her you were an ass about it. She's out there doing the trails trying to get in better shape. No that doesn't mean you need to go with her but this is on your friend not her. He let her come knowing what was expected of that hike. Then he took off leaving her behind? You both such and she did noting wrong.", "YTA and so is your friend. \n\nYour friend is TA because you explained to him your issue, and he clearly did not relay this to his gf. Which would have solved the problem.\n\nYou're TA for unleashing on the gf and not the boyfriend for being a spineless weenie.", "YTA", "My dog had double fangs on all 4 teeth.

To handle would be outright body shaming an d telling her to just straight up leave so I think your assessment needs a bit of persepctive, I mean even the fa y that the friend joined him in the hike and apologised for her behaviour tells me that she invited herself on this hike regardless of how OP feels, which definitely does not put him in AH territory, or the friend for that matter, because quite frankly if it was uncalled for why didn't he just leave with her?", "Certainly a possibility.

Late teens/early twenties, first long-term/serious relationship, doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s going to choke the life out of the relationship by being clingy.", "Literally. I mean he wouldn\u2019t have left a dog in the car like that, why does he think he can just leave her in the car with a window cracked for a few hours???", "He was straightforward, asking her if she thought she could keep up. Nothing wrong with that. What is the world coming to when we all have to dance around with our words, hoping to avoid hurt feelings?\n\nAlso, she knew she couldn't keep up. She found out the last time. Yet she seemed to expect everyone to kowtow to her needs.", "Because this isn't the first time this has happened and OP had a specific and somewhat strenuous hike in mind that wouldn't have been possible if the girlfriend came along again.", "Oh she absolutely knew. She called OP inconsiderate when he wanted to keep going and not wait for her on earlier hikes.", "Because she can open the car door and get out if she starts overheating, plus eat and drink whatever she brought for the hike. She can also call someone to get her. Dogs can't do any of those things.", "Um, because she\u2019s\u2026.a human? With opposable thumbs? Who could probably figure out how to, idk, *open the door and get out of the car if she gets too hot?*  Or open a water bottle?  I have to know, was your post meant in jest, or are you serious?", "\"... asked her if she would be able to do it or if she would need a break every 5 minutes like previous times. She got immediately offended, and asked me if I was serious. I simply recalled each time we had a walk in the same group..\"\n\nThis sounds unnecessarily aggressive to me. You call being thrown a verbal list of your own failures being straightforward? Being straightforward to me is more of a \" listen,based on your hiking experience this isn't a hike for you. I'm not going to stop and keep pace with you. Are you sure you can keep up/ want to go? Again, I'm not stopping for you.\"\n\nEdit: again, she is still one included in the ESH for several reasons including what you listed", "Sure, still doesn't excuse the degrading way he dealt with the situation imho.", ">When I would try to keep going she made comments about me being inconsiderate.\n\nThis is the only snippet of that. It sounds like a one-off. OP followed that with \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I explained the problem to my friend, that if we wanted to keep this up, she needed to be prepared or not come at all. \n\nSo again, the friend is the AH for not relaying this to GF. If the comments of OP being inconsiderate were so damaging, OPs friend should have relayed this to the GF, and OP shouldn't have let it get to a boiling point where he had to respond like an AH.", "Yes, it is being straightforward. Because clearly she is incapable of assessing her own abilities. Sometimes it needs to be spelled out explicitly in those cases."]}
