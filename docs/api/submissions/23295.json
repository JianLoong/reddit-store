There\u2019s a variety of trails with varying degrees on mileage and incline. I go to these to walk or run in line with my training program or just for fun. \n\nI have a friend who I\u2019ve known and been close with since middle school. Recently, he has asked to come along on these for some exercise. I was fine with this, until he asked if his girlfriend could come along. I didn\u2019t know her well but I accepted and it was a fine time.\n\nBut then she began coming to all of the trail walks. I usually wouldn\u2019t care, but she ends up complaining a lot, and needing breaks. I would be ok with this except it would be less than a mile in and she would continue to stop our group intermittently even when we tried to keep a specific pace. When I would try to keep going she made comments about me being inconsiderate. Often the walks/runs were ~3 miles.\n\nI explained the problem to my friend, that if we wanted to keep this up, she needed to be prepared or not come at all. In all honesty I don\u2019t know if she was inviting herself or if my friend was inviting her but regardless I make my intention with this clear. He said he would talk but that was 2 weeks ago.\n\nYesterday, I was planning on going on a long hike, about 6 miles with a lot of hills and a couple cliff-like areas. I made it clear I was looking for a specific pace when I asked my friend if he wanted to come, and he accepted, even mentioning that his gf was busy. I thought all was fine.\n\nWhen we met at the parking lot, I saw that his girlfriend ended up coming anyways. I was not in the mood to be stopping but I assumed she would be doing a much easier/shorter trail. When I asked her, said she was doing ours.\n\nI will admit I was a bit curt/ fed up when I spoke, but I straight up asked her if she would be able to do it or if she would need a break every 5 minutes like previous times. She got immediately offended, and asked me if I was serious. I simply recalled each time we had a walk in the same group and reaffirmed that I was serious. When my friend looked at me, I asked him if he really thought she could make the full trail when she struggled with a low incline, 2.5 mile walk last time.\n\nShe called me an asshole and went and sat in their car, waiting for my friend I assume. I just started the trail and my friend followed. He didn\u2019t say anything about it, except a \u201csorry about that\u201d, and he turned off his phone. \n\nAm I wrong for questioning her? Or should I have let her come, but deal with the consequences. I admit I struggle with being a little too honest at times, but I feel that this time could be reasonable? But I\u2019m not sure.", "created_utc": 1690503373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bi3rh/aita_for_suggesting_my_friends_girlfriend_is_not/", "score": 1449, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend either lied to you initially or the girlfriend shamed him into including her. He\u2019s the real problem.", "NTA. You set the expectations for your trip. If she is unable or unwilling to keep up, then that's on her. You shouldn't have to keep stopping if she doesn't have the conditioning to keep up.", "NTA - OP was specific about what he wanted and what his plans were. He was polite and spoke to his friend about it. You can't have one person slow down a whole group. GF is entitled. Her BF is an AH for leaving her in the car for a 6 mile hike though!", "NTA but your buddy is.\n\nIf you were being like this to your own GF, I'd be like, yep, 100%, you're the asshole. But this isn't your GF. It's your buddy's, and you did ask him to let her know you're doing a harder hike and aren't up for frequent breaks and belly aching.\n\nI mean, I bitch a lot on hikes. I do a lot of hard ones, so I'm pretty fit, plus I'm competitive in some sports. But I like to bitch. If that doesn't suit the people I'm hiking with, they're welcome to tell me to fuck off. Except my wife, she's stuck with me.\n\nBut, like I said, she's not your responsibility. I can get her being miffed if you were rude to her face, but you did set the expectation and it seems like your buddy did not communicate it well to her.\n\nSo I don't think she's quite the AH here, because there may be a misunderstanding between her and the BF. And leaving your GF in the car while you go and do something fun *and then turning off his phone* is totally the asshole move. But that's not your business.\n\nIn any case, $10 she breaks up with him over him being a jerk so none of this is your problem anymore.", "NTA. Each person hiking needs to be capable or it can put everyone at risk. Including beginners is great if it is a beginner level hike. More difficult hikes require skill and endurance. From her previous outings she didn\u2019t demonstrate either. Taking her could have put your own safety at risk.", "NTA but just stop calling this dude for your hikes.", "NTA - but you might need to stop inviting your friend if he's going to always bring his girlfriend who clearly doesn't want to take the hike seriously.", "NTA. You know you weren't because your friend turned off his phone.", "NTA- it\u2019s also probably healthy to set the boundary/expectation of \u201chey, I\u2019m going at x pace, if you can\u2019t keep up we can catch up later\u201d", "NTA. You\u2019re there to get a workout and it\u2019s not like there\u2019s unlimited time in the day to do that. Your friend is TA for wasting your exercise time and forcing your hand into saying something when you spoke to him privately about it to spare his girlfriend\u2019s feelings. This is an issue between them and he\u2019s rude for putting you in the middle of it.", "NTA, and your friend is probably in a very unhealthy relationship. Sounds like he knows it too.", "NTA. Maybe there can be times where you do the very easy trails for your friend and his girlfriend (if you want, you don't have to) but this is your thing, you want to do the trails you want to do, and she clearly isn't up for them. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's unfair for her to think that you're going to adjust to her pace every time you go out.", "You\u2019re probably going to get a lot of yta but I\u2019m actually going to say NTA. It\u2019s very frustrating when someone ruins something you like doing, you shouldn\u2019t have to waste your time waiting around for someone that can\u2019t keep up", "Nta, I mean you kinda sound like an ass,  but seems reasonable here", "NTA. She needs to understand her limitations, if she wants to come with you that bad then she should come on shorter trails and that too every once in a while, not every fucking time.", "NTA . Given your friend just left with you I would guess the relationship isn't in a good place. She may well have been inviting herself along.\n\nBut for relevancy, it's acceptable to expect the people you do an activity with, to also be able to perform the activity.\n\nIt's okay for this woman to have a different competency and fitness level. But what isn't okay is to insist on coming on EVERY hike without considering if she can even do it whilst keeping up with you guys.\n\nAs an overweight person myself I'd openly expect you to go ahead of me. Organise to meet up at a certain point in the trail or even at the end for a break/lunch or whatever.", "NTA\n\nIf she struggled before, she definitely would've struggled this time. I used to love walking long distances before I got Covid. I can't manage it now which might be a combination of Long Covid and age and there's no way I'd hike even 2 miles on the flat now. Well, maybe but with many breaks. If I did I wouldn't tag along with people who like to stride ahead because it would ruin their hike. The way your friend said 'sorry about that' makes me think he'd already had the conversation with her but she'd insisted anyway. Maybe to show there's no hard feelings do a softies walk with him and her (and maybe an elderly woman!) and take a picnic.", "NTA\n\nYou're not suggesting anything that isn't already a fact. Her denial doesn't change the fact that she can't handle your hikes. Maybe you should stop inviting your friend if he can't go without his girlfriend having to tag along.", "NTA your friend's girlfriend is super annoying (not to mention lazy as f, from the sound of it). Your friend is a wuss for not managing his gf's attitude & interference with the pace of the hikes. Could you have handled this better? Yes, but you were specifically told she *would not* be there, so you were understandably frustrated. I'd advise you to make a heartfelt apology for being rude, as it's better than permanently losing a friend or alienating his significant other.", "NTA but I don't think you care about her fitness. I think you care that she took something from you (the hikes you were doing with your homie). You and your homie need to have an honest chat.", "NTA.\n\nIf she insists on tagging along, when she needs her multiple rests, her bf can stay behind with her while you continue at your preferred pace. It was fine to give her a break the first time or two, but now she's hijacking your hike. If she can't keep up, she needs to find a slower hiking partner.", "ESH. Not for being angry, or for expecting courtesy from the people who you take with you, but for how you went about it.\n\nThere's many ways to figure it out, and one of them is saying \"I'm sorry but I didn't realize you were coming. I have a set time I can do this trail so I can't stop, but you guys can go at your own pace. It's ok if you guys need a breather but due to my own time constraints/needs I'm going to go on ahead.\" then go on ahead as planned. \n\nYou also should be angry at your trail partner for never giving you the courtesy of a heads up about the extra person. You both should be choosing paths that works for her * ONLY IF* you both agreed to take her beforehand and have already decided it's ok to be a snail on some baby trails for her to build up to your guys level. It's not on you to stoop to beginner level stuff without warning just to accommodate a self-invited guest (even if the friend is who invited her)\n\nLast thing: if your friend continues to show up with her being an unannounced guest, stop inviting him.\n\nEdited for more accurate ESH vote instead of  yta", "nta, your friend is the asshole to BOTH you and her", "ESH - You certainly could have handled the situation better. Your friend sucks because he clearly hasn't had the discussion with her. She sucks because she is clearly taking the enjoyment out of something that you enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe to rectify the situation, you should go one some lower intensity hikes and help her build her endurance so that she is able to do better on the more intense tracks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\\* To clarify why everyone sucks - if somebody who is clearly a beginner wishes to join in with people who are clearly more advanced, they should recognize this and expect in some cases to keep up or not hinder the others. Equally, the more advanced participants should allow lenience and cater a couple of activities for the beginner to take part and improve.", "YTA; She knows her endurance, you don't need to shame her and place your friend in this bind.\n\nI need to ask are you male or female (or non binary)?", "lowkey ESH. girlfriend should have the sensitivity and social awareness that she's slowing everyone down. once or twice would be okay but if it's every single time, she should have noticed that the group is more experienced and for the amount of times she went on the hikes, she should have been able to gauge her capabilities. boyfriend should have talked to her like he promised. OP could have talked to her directly and politely (with the permission of boyfriend who is clearly afraid of confrontation).", "ESH except her. Altho I don't blame you for wanting to go without her you were an ass about it. She's out there doing the trails trying to get in better shape. No that doesn't mean you need to go with her but this is on your friend not her. He let her come knowing what was expected of that hike. Then he took off leaving her behind? You both such and she did noting wrong.", "YTA and so is your friend. \n\nYour friend is TA because you explained to him your issue, and he clearly did not relay this to his gf. Which would have solved the problem.\n\nYou're TA for unleashing on the gf and not the boyfriend for being a spineless weenie.", "YTA", "My dog had double fangs on all 4 teeth.

Why did he invite her? Why didn't he explain you had a fitness goal for the hike and it wasnt an appropriate couple activity? If it was so important that they had to spend the time together that day and that time, why did he just show up without informing you he'd had an emergency change of plans? What the Hell happened to that \"talk\" they were supposed to have?

If someone said they'd going for a 6 miles hilly hike I might presume there was an expected level of fitness needed, but again have no real worry about a specific pace because that's not really a thing (as a relatively experienced hiker in the UK) that I'm aware of. Even a very hilly hike can easily be finished in a few hours, so unless you're doing some kind of fell running challenge I don't see why it would make a difference to have an extra 30 mins for more frequent stops. If someone needs to stop after a mile of level walking either they are very unfit, or you aren't walking.

Maybe as simple as red/amber/green.

Not too fast, not too steep, no planned pace. Bring sandwiches, eat them at a lookout. That way gf can join once in a while without slowing you down.

Plan for a longer break.\n* If there is more than one trail to the same spot, have the weaker ones take the easier trail and the stronger ones take the harder one, and meet at the designated spot.\n* Walk to something cool, where people want to hang out for a while anyhow, so if you're waiting on someone, you are still having fun.\n* Make sure there is more than one person at each level, so the fasties can be together and the slowies as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I think you need to be more clear about doing a walk with JUST your friend.

People *always* overestimate their physical and spatial abilities when it comes to true hiking. They confuse hiking with walking a tame trail. I\u2019ve seen people twist ankles or collapse from exhaustion 3 miles back in the woods. The problem of getting them out safely then is the whole party\u2019s responsibility. This can easily turn into a life-or-death situation for everyone, at least in Pennsylvania where we have (usually ok) black bears and (really scary) mountain lions. So now I would never hike with anyone I wasn\u2019t confident in. It\u2019s simply too much of a liability. This woman is being irresponsible for pushing herself past what she can comfortably handle. That is a very, very risky thing to do in an isolated, hard-for-emergency-crews-to-reach place. It would be an absolute NO for me.\n\nedit: it to she", "This is honestly bizarre.  When she turned up after saying she was busy, my initial thought was whether you are a woman, but based on your comment history, I see that you are not. \n\nNTA - you were clear with your friend about the pace, and you told her the same thing because you wanted to make sure she knew before starting.  You also did not invite her.  Sure you could have been more polite about it, but I also don\u2019t think slowing down your pace and then calling you inconsiderate for the times you didn\u2019t want to slow down was considerate of her, either.  I certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s nice to come on walks repeatedly and hold everybody up. It is very very odd, but this is something your friend needs to sort out with his GF.\n\nFor the future, I don\u2019t think this should go on as it has been going. You have a few options here, but given that your friend left his GF behind, I wonder if the best way is to just arrange for the walks with your friend, and then just go at your intended pace - no heads up (she already knows you intend to keep up a certain pace that she cannot) and no listening to her complaining.  If you\u2019re ahead you may not even have to, and if you finish well ahead, I would just leave afterwards and let your friend wait for his GF.  Or, just stop telling your friend about walks.", "**NTA**\n\nYou had a hiking thing and were gracious enough to allow the friend to accompany you. That in itself was pretty nice of you because now you have to deal with his chit-chat and whatever during a time when you may have been more interested in the natural peace of your hike. For the girlfriend to tag along *might* have been more or less acceptable, but not when she started complaining and requiring accommodations.\n\nAfter I retired, I started walking / hiking with a few guys who informally call themselves the Old Men's Walking Club.\n\nIt starts with a coffee or whatever at a local diner and then we drive to what is usually a new trail in the huge network of trails in our area.\n\nMy introductory speech went along the lines of 'anybody is welcome to join us at the diner, but only those who are fit enough for the woods are invited to hike. Also, don't get yourself hurt because we're too old to carry your ass.'", "NTA \nDon't let them ruin your hike. Don't invite them.\nI've asked friends to do some walking BEFORE hiking season and they never do. Then they whine at me to slow down. It's annoying.\nI love big, beautiful women. I've taken a few hiking with me at the time I was seeing them. They kept up just fine and certainly didn't complain. Why can't my friends or siblings?", "NTA.\n\nHer ego gets trumped by real safety concerns.  One does not simply start hiking long, difficult trails.  It's not 'just walking.'", "NTA...He turned off his phone? He agreed with you.", "NTA.. you did what he couldn\u2019t do", "This sounds a little like my situation.  Friend always brings girlfriend to every hangout.  Eats and stuff but never splits the bill even.", "Nta your friend should have been able to stand up to her and say no", "NTA. A little rough but honesty hurts sometimes.  \n\n\nHiking isn't a joke. It's actually a matter of safety that the group sticks together. I've had multiple conversations with friends about this as there are two kinds of hikers that I really see.   \n\n\nFirst you have the people who just want to get to the destination and want to keep a fast pace to do so. This sounds like you.  \n\n\nSecond, you have people who enjoy the journey, take their time, and don't rush to get to the end. I don't actually think that's the case for the girlfriend here - but it'd be a case I'd make for her if she wanted.   \n\n\nThe reality of the situation is that she needs to be able to keep up with the group or organize some slower paced hikes to continue with their fitness journey. It's not a bad thing to hike either way listed above - but you need to have the whole team on board when you're hiking one of those two ways.  \n\n\nPeople rushing to get to the end of the trail don't want a leisurely walk, and people who want a leisurely walk don't want to be rushed.   \n\n\nI do think you could be more considerate - but saying you have a face paced hike planned doesn't mean you have to change your plans because someone slow wants to join you. Maybe another time.", "NTA", "Wrong! The way he approached it made him an AH. This reminds me of people who claim to be \"brutally honest\" but in reality they are just asses. \n\nDefinitely nothing wrong with letting it be known you won't be stopping every 5 min.", "Bitching about hikes is different than telling somebody they are an AH for not slowing down to your pace, when you are the one who joined them.", "Exactly, as a hiker with short legs and asthma I\u2019m quick to call someone a AH for not adjusting pace to the slowest member of the party. However, this is a different situation, and frankly, it\u2019s between the friend and his girlfriend. Especially since the friend asked to join OP in the first place. Also OP didn\u2019t specify how frequently these hikes are taking place but if it\u2019s something like every weekend then I can understand why the girlfriend wanting to spend that time with her partner. OP should really just go back to doing his hikes solo, and his friend needs to sort out his relationship.", "Why should he care about her fitness though? Especially when the whole point of these hikes was to be a part of his own training program? It would be one thing if they were purely physical, but he started these hikes with a specific goal in mind.  She wasn\u2019t even directly invited by OP AND she is deterring him from his stated goal.\n\nI don\u2019t know why she insists on coming along on these hikes, but if is to enjoy some trails, the girlfriend and the friend should have just set aside some time to do their own thing at a pace that worked for her.", "Yup. Legit said thr. His friend is an ah for bringing her along. Doesnt give him a get out of asshole free card for the way he acted tho", "And yet the friend is incapable of putting his foot down, and is being an asshole by forcing OP to do it instead.\n\nSo NTA, and stop inviting that friend.", "It sounds like she drove herself.", "Apparently the friend can keep OP's pace, and having a companion can make a hike much more pleasant.", ">Yeah I really don't think this is his fault.\n\nIt quite literally his fault, she invited herself along and he should have shut that down right then instead of forcing OP to be the bad guy.", "[removed]", "According to his profile, OP is male", "The way the friend reacted in the end tells me maybe instead of excluding him as has been suggested here, maybe OP needs to get the two of them together and ask the friend if everything is okay, especially in regards to his relationship. He sounds like a defeated man.", "Yeah but it\u2019s caused enough drama that he came to Reddit to ask if he\u2019s an asshole . I think walking alone would help in avoiding drama from someone else\u2019s  relationship and  that would make the walk more enjoyable. Or he could get a new walking partner.", "The thing is she can\u2019t do a 3 mile walk on a gentle slope without stopping a bunch of times, why do you think she could handle a 6 mile walk with a bunch of hills?", "Why?", "YTA because your real problem is not 'is she fit enough' at all - she may well be fit enough, at her pace. People hike for different reasons. Apparently you do it to be competitive (even if it's just against yourself). If you or your friend aren't advertising accordingly, that's on you.", "I can see why it was a mixed bag in the other sub. By itself, the idea of suggesting that this may be too advanced of a hike for her is not wrong. I\u2019m not in great shape and I\u2019d be appreciative if someone warned me that a trail was out of my league. \n\nBut it sounds like the way you went about it was less than nice. You vented weeks of frustration on her. Frustration that she may not have been aware of, you even admit that your friend may not have spoken with her. I generally thinks it\u2019s uncool to let problems pile up and then unload everything all at once, blindsiding someone. \n\nThe biggest AH is your friend who brought his girlfriend after you asked him not to. You shouldn\u2019t have gone off on her but your points were valid so I\u2019m going to say NTA.", "I think it would have been better to let the girlfriend know that you were going to do the hike at a pace without any breaks and ask her if she was sure she wanted to come.\n\nYou could then have told her, ok, but every time I have hiked with you in the past you have needed many breaks. Are you ok with being left behind or what is your plan? Then reiterated that you are not stopping this time. That would have left her with the autonomy to decide rather than making yourself the arbitrator of her limits. NTA", "NTA - OP was on this for the \"workout/adventure\".  She was on this for the \"social\".  Different goals like this do not mix well.", "NTA. You warned your friend beforehand, and he shouldn't have brought his gf along. It seems like she invited herself (maybe she is the kind of girl who wants to do everything together). Her own bf turned his phone off on her, so she's really the AH here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust tell them you will do your pace, they are two, so they can fall back alone without being ababdoned. YOu are not their babysitter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: You are a slow learner.

But since it\u2019s a girl, the boyfriend is \u201cwuss\u201d for not stopping her from coming. \n\nGotta love double standards in this sub. NTA", "INFO. Did you ever tell the girlfriend directly that you wanted to keep a particular pace?", "You probably won't have to worry about the GF anymore. After being left in the car while he does a difficult 6 mile hike, she probably isn't a GF anymore.", "YTA   You keep inviting your friend, and you know from past experience the gf is coming along. So\u2026 stop inviting your friend. Or set a boundary. \u201cI am happy to start this walk off together but I won\u2019t be stopping for breaks. I don\u2019t mind if you do and we get separated along the way.\u201d  If they say that\u2019s rude, explain it is about your fitness regimen and again, stop inviting them. \n\nYou behaving the same way and expecting others to change so you have a better outcome is a futile and AH exercise. If you want things to change, the only person you can change is yourself.", "NTA\n\nShe obviously has no clue about her own limits and also is acting very selfishly and entitled complaining about you wanting to go ahead when she needs breaks. As long as her BF stays with her during those breaks I don't see how this is even remotely an issue.\n\nAbout this particular hike though, the way you describe it seems like it is a hike that would be far past her capabilities. Going on this hike could have been dangerous for her and she needed to be prevented from doing it even if it meant she had to hear some things she didn't like. This is a huge safety issue.\n\nYour friend sucks here too. He told you she wouldn't be coming and then brought her to a hike he should also have known was dangerous for her. Then after the spat, he just leaves her to sit in the car while he goes on a 6 mile hike. Whether or not he agreed with how she handled the situation, he absolutely should have just taken her home and talked things out with her.", "Sounds like your friend is not in a healthy relationship and doesn\u2019t know how to end it. I think it became clear she is inviting herself and suffocating him. \n\nNTA.", "NTA! Please keep us updated on how this all shakes out. Your friend clearly has boundary issues and she seems really out of touch with reality. There is nothing wrong with expressing your need (especially as the person who started these hikes as your own fitness plan), stating reality, and enforcing your boundaries.", "NTA.  Trails are rated at various levels of difficulty.  There is an expected group pace.  When she can't keep up, she should 'turn back' with her BF in tow.  After wasting their time once or twice, they will learn.  Make it clear you will not be stopping for a set period of time.  If you are connected with the local hiking groups, suggest they join organized group hikes rated for her fitness level.", "NTA. I sympathize with the gf, as I also a) like hikes but b) am not in super great shape and need breaks when hiking more frequently than other people and also c) can be kind of clingy and don't like being left out of things. But you hiking is something you're doing for yourself, not for your friend or for whoever your friend decides to bring along. Hard to say whether whether your friend is TA for not communicating with his girlfriend effectively or she's TA for refusing to listen. Or both. But in any case I agree you're NTA for wanting to do something for yourself.", "NTA. My bf and his friend love going on hikes too. I go on hikes with them sometimes, but they both know I can only do so much physically (and I'm well aware of this too lol.) When they wanna do some crazy long or intense hikes, I let them go enjoy that and do somethin else at home or with my friend. If I know it's gonna potentially be too hard to keep up, I just won't go with em that time- and they know to let me know whether its gonna be a chill hike or a strenuous one. Communication is a big thing here, but since you've obviously communicated your concerns and they have disregarded this, you're NTA.", "Honestly, as an avid hiker, the \"Cliff like\" parts do it for me.

I think girlfriend is abusive to the friend and he\u2019s reaching a breaking point.", "I don't see why the comment on OP's gender was necessary", "How does the friend not communicating with his girlfriend OP's problem", "I disagree with this. The way the end of the post went really points to his friend is in a toxic relationship and needs help getting out if it.

You shouldn't call them one when they're trying to get better, that makes you the AH", "Understood the OPs copy. Not disagreeing it\u2019s frustrating simply saying we can handle disappointments with more graciousness than they did. Someone else said the same thing and got massively down votes like my comment because apparently the standards of social discourse are low in this group.

He has work to do.\n\nIt would be a kindness to specifically choose one hike every other month or so that she could do more easily, but it\u2019s not a requirement, just a way in which to help your friend navigate his minefield.", "ESH. The obvious solution is to stop inviting your friend on the runs/hikes. Duh.", "NTA.  She shouldn't go for a six mile walk if she's tired after 2.5.  It's nice that she's willing to do some exercise but she should go with someone who has a a similar pace and work her way up to a six mile walk/hike.", "YTA for anger misdirection. You snapped at the girl, instead of at your friend.\n\nShe might not have known you even had a problem with it.", "NTA. I\u2019ll admit I was like her in attitude on trails, but I was a kid forced to go on trails I couldn\u2019t handle. Got so bad on one trail, when I was a preteen, that it\u2019s the family joke to mention the trail number when someone complains too much (I don\u2019t mind that at all as looking back I can see the humour).\n\nNowadays, I\u2019ve learned my limits and know what trails I can do and what I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t push my limits unless I\u2019m trying to be better, and even then, I don\u2019t push too much.\n\nShe needs to know her limits and work with them so that she doesn\u2019t ruin the hike for everyone else.", "ESH, although far and away the biggest asshole is your dumbass friend. You made it clear time and time again that his GF held all of you back, he refused to do anything about it. You, on the other hand, needed to direct this frustration toward your buddy and leave his GF out of it as best you can. I don\u2019t understand why you addressed her at all, she was already there and you already know what her physical capabilities are. If I had to guess, she was not aware of how annoyed you were by her needing breaks because her boyfriend was too much of a wuss to press the issue it honestly, but it was still a dick move to not pick up on that and grill your boy for fucking up the hike. You have to put the responsibility on him here or you look like AH", "Repost from a few weeks ago", "Perfectly said. And as someone who loves hiking, but also enjoys frequent breaks on the uphill, I would never join a group hike with people who want to get a certain time or keep a pace. Or I would be okay hiking by myself behind them (given it's a \"safe\" trail; clearly marked, no bushwhacking). This is pretty inconsiderate of the girlfriend.", "Homeboy turned off his phone, sounds like he's tired of her attitude. Can't quite blane him.", "I think Ok\\_Ad was saying that she calls someone an AH for going too fast for the slowest member.", "Why should OP have to ruin their hike by catering to someone they don\u2019t particularly want there? OP is just a person wanting to enjoy a hike, not some hiking club leader. There\u2019s no reason for OP to do that.", "The boyfriend should\u2019ve put a stop to it though. Not leave her in a car. Or break up long before this", "She\u2019s a grown woman who can leave the car if she wants. She can all someone for a ride. Stop acting like she\u2019s a helpless child.", "How would you have preferred OP to say \"No, you can't do this hike because you're not up to it?\"", "I love to hike, but I also know my own limits. You are NTA. Either she is TA for inviting herself on a hike she can't handle or her BF is TA for not telling her she wasn't invited.", "NTA.  I would have gone on the hike and when she stopped tell him, \u201cyou can wait, I am continuing.\u201d  I hike with varying people and we do accommodate whomever needs what, breaks, etc.  you obviously have no intention of going slower and made that clear to your friend.  You really should have stopped inviting him.", "YTA\n\nLook, I get it, from your POV you've brought this up multiple times and this was the straw that broke the camel's back. But you actually never brought it up TO THE GF. So you have NO IDEA if she had ANY IDEA this was a problem until you completely lashed out on her. Perhaps you thought your attempts to \"keep going\" when she wanted a break were clear communication. They weren't.\n\nYou basically communicated solely through your friend, you have no idea what this guy told his gf, and then you freaked out AT THE POOR GIRL. Pick your target, man. If you want to pretend the guy is the one responsible, then hold him responsible. That would look like telling him, \"sorry dude, I'm running this alone --- I told you to let your GF know this was going to be too difficult for her skill level. It would be rude to leave her back here alone.\" And then turning to her and saying something like, \"Sorry he didn't let you know this was going to be significantly more difficult than our other runs.\"\n\nAt that point you're a perfectly reasonable dude. And if she says that he DID tell her then you can be upset with her.\n\nAs for your other runs, if the expectation is you don't take breaks for anyone then you could've sent out invites to your friends and INCLUDE HER but say you're increasing your training and plan to keep the pace with no breaks; everyone is welcome but you'll be continuing on if someone take a breaks and you can all meet at the end.\n\nThis entire problem could easily be that you decided you couldn't communicate directly with your friend's GF and relied on an intermediary --- combined with indirect communication rather than direct communication for things that were bothering you.", "NTA. \n\nI was once called fat-phobic and ableist for suggesting a common acquaintance shouldn't join our group on a very difficult trail, so I understand your frustration.\n\nHe was out of shape (obese and no muscle), and was in the process of inviting himself \"to tag along\" when my group of friends and I were discussing the logistics of the trip at a pub. \n\nIt was a very demanding trail towards a summit of about 1500mts elevation. This is a 50km, two-day hike stopping at a camp base, with the need to climb a couple of walls. When I pointed out that he didn't have the mountaineering training and would be dangerous for him to \"tag along\", he got pissed off and started saying I was excluding him because he was fat. \n\n(I was excluding him because the hike was impossible for someone who gets winded walking up some stairs). \n\nSome people really think mountaineering is like having a picnic at the park.", "YTA. Everyone always wants people to get physically fit but never wants to help them do that. These are great chances for her to get out and be active and you shut that down.", "NTA - I have physical limitations and a fear of ticks, and my husband and his friend love to walk up mountains in tick land. I stay home lol", "NTA!!  \nI would say that your friend's reaction is all the proof you need that she is the inconsiderate AH and he didn't actually invite her to tag along. Anyone with an ounce of sense would accept that she is not able to keep up with experienced hikers and let them go on without her.   \nThis situation called for brutal honesty since she refused to accept that she was impeding your progress.", "NTA for sure.\n\nYour buddy? Eh, he is prob is an AH - because he failed to communicate with his gf beforehand; and/or he left her in the car for what was prob about a 3 hour hike lol.\n\nThat being said, I doubt their relationship survives this, so you may not have to deal with this much longer. I can't imagine any girl who would be okay with sitting in the car for 3+ hours while y'all hike.", "NTA.\n\nYou made your priorities clear. You were being responsible, your friend on the other hand, not at all.", "Really? Did you not notice that he never actually spoke to this girl until the very end when he basically told her to stay put? Relying on his friend as the communicator to his GF was really immature and likely caused this entire problem.\n\nI cannot believe his friend showed up with his GF and these two doofuses took off without here. The correct thing to do was to leave both his friend and his GF behind. His friend utterly failed by bringing his GF and put OP in this position --- and them, fun fun, blamed the girl rather than her doofus of a boyfriend who couldn't deliver a simple message and maintain a simple boundary.", "Don't you think OP is the jerk for communicating with the GF through her BF rather than directly? That seems like such a bizarre move to me.", "This is a good point that people are missing. This solidifies in my head the fact that he friend is either spineless or two faced.", "I see your point, but he is not doing these hikes for fun- he has a training goal in mind. \nWhy should he be forced to set aside his goal every time for her?\nAlso, why is it OP's responsibility to \" find a friend for the GF\"? It's not his girlfriend! Why on earth should the guy who is training with a goal in mind now orchestrate a \" friend\" for the person who he hijacks his training sessions to keep her happy? I fail to see how OP over functioning for his FRIEND'S GIRLFRIEND just to keep the peace is a good solution.", "But I guess that's also on her to realize \" huh- I really struggled to keep up on a flat 2.5 miles, now they are going on a 6 mile hike with cliffs. This will likely be too hard for me\". \nOP's description as stated seemed pretty obvious- if GF was unsure after that, she could have googled the trail herself. GF has also experienced the pace that OP sets and has found it too challenging. She KNOWS by now what she's getting into- she either doesn't want to accept her limits or is totally fine selfishly hijacking the intended training pace that OP explicitly stated was his intention. \nReal AH here is the friend, who understands the situation and is just letting the drama happen between OP and GF as if he had no part in this or couldn't prevent it.", "A terrible take with no explanation. Gotta love it.", "\"Why doesn't he let the gf go and y'all to can go on hikes together and have all the weird alone time you apparently want.\" \n\nThat's... exactly what OP was trying to do though.", "This. OPs friend needs to remind her that nobody wants to be standing by watching as recovery specialists lift her off the side of the cliff in a basket cuz she couldn\u2019t make it", "I disagree. He has no obligations to this girl.\n\nHis friend is the person he should talk with. He has a relationship with this girl.", "...OP didn't communicate ANY of that to the GF.", "Reeks of insecurity", "Right? Like wtf is wrong with this dude.", "because the GF wasn't invited and his friend who WAS invited indicated that she was otherwise occupied that day.  OP didn't need to talk to her about it because it was heavily implied that she wouldn't be there because: \n\n> I made it clear I was looking for a specific pace when I asked my friend if he wanted to come, and he accepted, **even mentioning that his gf was busy.** I thought all was fine.", "You have no idea if that's the case. For all we know, the BF didn't communicate effectively to his GF and this girl was utterly surprised it was such a big deal. I can hear it now:\n\n\"Oh look, my plans got cancelled. I'll join you for your hike!\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a bit of a more difficult hike. Are you sure you're up for it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! I'll just take more breaks.\"\n\n\"Friend doesn't love it when we take a lot of breaks...\"\n\n\"Well, Friend needs to be more considerate.\"\n\nTada. GF didn't do anything wrong and BF failed communication 101 and then failed to have her back.\n\nAn effective communicator would've said to her proposal to join the run.\n\n\"Sorry, Friend explicitly said this was going to be a much more difficult hike and he didn't want to take any breaks, so it's not a good fit for your experience level. When I get back around x, let's grab dinner.\" \n\nAnd this is what makes OP an asshole - by relying on his friend to do all of his communication with this poor girl, he completely side-stepped responsibility for being clear on his boundaries with the person actually pushing them. So now we're all stuck extrapolating what conversation happened between the BF and the GF when OP should've just handled this shit himself from the beginning rather than being such a crappy \"can't talk to girl\" idiot.", "Imagine if the friend didnt let her come. He'd still be the ass hole cause he is controlling and telling her what she can and can't do. Sometimes you just can't win around here.", "You're a waste of space, Larrie. Hiking with a friend is weird? Maybe make a few friends yourself and you won't be the weird one.", "Damn, that made me laugh a little too hard lol", "While I feel like only she can know her limits truly, you do have some experience with her and hiking without being prepared is NOT something to fuck around with. I am dealing with chronic hip disability since going for a steep hike around a bluff for about 6 hours when I was not usually a hiker. It\u2019s been years and I still have issues I work through in PT. \n\nI was a long distance runner and ran miles a day so I thought I was fit for the activity. It\u2019s a completely different skill set and even someone relatively fit should not take on very long hikes without working their way up to long distances slowly. It is uneven ground, often on an incline or decline. I learned the hard way and was sobbing in the woods trying to finish the path (narrow steep steps, can not pass others on it if you turn around) and it changed my life. It isn\u2019t only the fact that it was 6 hours, I knew less than an hour in that I had fucked up. I always warn people that if you can\u2019t climb stairs for that long, you might struggle to hike for that long. Some trails are more beginner friendly, but it\u2019s best to be safe. \n\nNTA based on personal experience of biting off more than I can chew in the past. Safety over feelings always. She will have a better experience if she works her way up to being able to enjoy longer hikes and more difficult trails. If you injure yourself early on, the chances of going back to that activity are slimmer.", "Or friend needs to grow a spine and tell his gf this is just for me and my buddy", "That's the vibe I get. I'm very familiar with it. If he would have gotten back into the car with her, she'd still tear him apart for whatever made her angry. He's tired of hearing it because it happens every time, for literally everything. It says a lot that he turned off his phone. He is done.", ">GF has also experienced the pace that OP sets and has found it too challenging. She KNOWS by now what she's getting into- she either doesn't want to accept her limits or **is totally fine selfishly hijacking the intended training pace** that OP explicitly stated was his intention.\n\nThat's why I said he's not the asshole. However the idea of a \"training pace hike\" isn't one I've ever heard of, so in principle she could just think he's made it up to passive aggressively exclude her. I don't think that makes him the asshole (presuming that she's wrong) but if she can do the activity albeit at a much slower pace then she might not understand why it's so important to him that it's completed in a certain time rather than just slowing it down and including her. This whole situation just seems incredibly weird to me, and when people come on here to justify weird situations it makes me slightly suspicious of them.", "That and also turned off his phone. Is he trying to get away from her???", "It isn't about having an obligation to the girl. It's about having an issue with the girl's behavior, so he should speak directly to the person he has an issue with rather than going through a third party.", "I was wondering this. Abusers often create conflict between the victim and victim\u2019s friends so that they can pretend the friend is the one isolating the victim, it\u2019s not their fault. Eg, invite herself along, piss OP off, when OP finally calls her out she cuts OP off and expects friend to do the same \u201cto defend her,\u201d now friend doesn\u2019t have OP anymore and is one step closer to isolation.", "NTA - tho I would have told her the situation and explained that she is on her own for keeping up or getting back at her own pace and you won't be waiting on her.", "NTA She never would have made it.", "I very clearly said his friend. OP supposedly wants to walk the trails alone anyway. But doesn't mind his friend. There's a big difference. \n\nYet for some reason minds his girlfriend horribly. It's weird.", "I disagree. Absent his friend, he just wouldn't invite this girl again and that would be that.\n\nThe only reason she's on this trips is his friend - he should talk to his friend, the person he has a relationship with.", "Try \"don't want to, don't have to\"\n\nBecause I can. Now go away.", "Nothing new here.", "And you're a waste of brain cells that can kiss my ass. Goodbye."]}
