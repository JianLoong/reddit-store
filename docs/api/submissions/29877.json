I refused to pay another dime for bad and undeserving servers with nasty attitudes. My friend later implied that I ruined the evening yet I feel her insistence did.

Like you, I just don\u2019t go there. I hope that you are tipping at restaurants that don\u2019t automatically charge gratuity even if you think the service wasn\u2019t as good as you deserved. So, in this case, you would\u2019ve been paying gratuity, either way as far as I can tell. You just don\u2019t like the compelled gratuity, which is fair. However, it\u2019s not a valid reason to veto the restaurant when your friend obviously really wanted to go there. The act you had to grind was not worth it but you stuck to it anyway. I would\u2019ve been much more sympathetic if you were just complaining about their crappy service, but even that wouldn\u2019t be a good enough reason for you to veto your friends, strong desire to have brunch at the restaurant that you hate.

I worked with people and I was getting change and was grateful but I guess they had the money and didn't mind. I dont and do. Its what it is. I dont tip and im not ashamed. Also wait staff in this country have gooood money, they dont rely on tips here. I was once in Napoli and there was the tip already on the check and I felt disgusted.
