I\u2019ve been here 7 years so I\u2019ve got a good hang of what\u2019s worth it and what\u2019s not. A friend and I were walking around trying to decide on brunch and she wanted to stop at a notoriously bad restaurant (the hive). Not bad in the sense of the food being bad but bad in the sense of customer service being really shitty yet they charge an automatic gratuity at the end of the bad service. I\u2019ve had servers barely acknowledge me for upwards of 30 minutes, spill things on me, be impatient taking my order and taking 30 minutes to run my credit card. I told my friend I was fine ordering to go and just taking it nearby to eat but she didn\u2019t want to and insisted on eating in. I refused to pay another dime for bad and undeserving servers with nasty attitudes. My friend later implied that I ruined the evening yet I feel her insistence did. There were plenty of other brunch places nearby that I mentioned trying that we could sit and eat at but she was adamant on the hive due to some tiktok so AITA?", "created_utc": 1698546513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17itawo/aita_for_refusing_to_dine_at_an_automatic/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've been to this exact location and you know you don't like it. Your friend is the asshole for not being willing to compromise at all.", "you ruined the evening at...brunch time? \n\nNTA in the scenario obviously but this smells like bait.", "NTA\n\nYour reasons for avoiding the place are 100% legitimate.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to want to find a restaurant you both agree upon. Part of enjoying yourself is knowing you\u2019re getting your money\u2019s worth!", "NTA. You had good reasons to decline going in and I doubt it\u2019s her lifelong dream to dine there. You had other options on hand, too, that she apparently did not want to hear about. If she wants her TikTok experience so badly, she\u2019s free to have it without you.", "NTA! Even if there wasn\u2019t automatic gratuity and that wasn\u2019t a factor in this situation, simply having bad experiences with service is enough to justify not going to a restaurant. \n\nAlso, you offered several compromises, including ordering food to go. Completely reasonable.", "Nta. Your friend is an A-hol however.", "NTA. As the guide it's your job to recommend good places, and avoid bad tourist traps. But more importantly, you're supposed to pick a place to eat *together* and your friend is being an AH by calling you one because you didn't wanna eat there", "NTA for not wanting to go to a place with bad service, especially knowing you\u2019ll be automatically charged for that service. You offered alternatives, your friend said no to them. That\u2019s on her, not you.", "NTA, get better friends", "seems like a wird hill to die on.", "NtA, could you have just sat with her and let her experience the bullshit?", "NTA but I would have said I will go but if the service is bad you are paying the automatic gratuity. I don't fault you, when I was younger I used to refuse to go to places with a cover charge. I certainly don't go to automatic gratuity places unless it's like a place where the party is more than 6 then I understand. Otherwise, good service I happily pay 20-25% but if service is poor or subpar when it's clearly the servers fault I will leave a lot less or nothing. Nothing only happened 2x in the last 30 years so very rare.", "NTA\n\nYou listed alternatives and they were refused. I would also not go to a place that had automatic gratuity. \n\nI'd take it one further and go, if a restaurant determines an automatic gratuity, no matter how good t h.g e service is, I won't tip a cent more, even if that gratuity is 5 percent. I do this for the exact reasons you listed above. The restaurant should not decide an automatic tip for me. If there is no automatic gratuity I generally tip around 25 percent.", "I think it's a little bit weird to be hung up on the automatic tip, because money is money no matter if it is priced into the menu items or added on later. But it is of course reasonable to avoid a place with really bad service. NTA", "NTA - Automatic gratuities are extortion. They should call it the \u201cWe don\u2019t want to pay them enough tax\u201d", "NTA. Eating anywhere that has tipping is ridiculous. It is their job to take your order and bring you your food. No reason to give them more money.", "Appears as if eating out is only for the rich, along with most things, as they have stolen pretty much everything out from under us\u2026 revolution!", "[deleted]", "INFO\n\n> they charge an automatic gratuity at the end of the bad service\n\nThat you can't *manually change*?\n\nIs this a *gratuity* or a *service charge*?", "NTA but I don\u2019t feel super supportive of your stance because it seems like you don\u2019t tip when you don\u2019t think the service is good enough. Whether your wait staff is having a bad day shouldn\u2019t dictate whether they can pay the rent. They showed up to work and they still provided you a service. They deserve a tip. Every time. I also hate the system where restaurant owners pass the buck to customers via gratuity. But I\u2019m not gonna screw over the servers because I don\u2019t down the policy. Like you, I just don\u2019t go there. I hope that you are tipping at restaurants that don\u2019t automatically charge gratuity even if you think the service wasn\u2019t as good as you deserved. So, in this case, you would\u2019ve been paying gratuity, either way as far as I can tell. You just don\u2019t like the compelled gratuity, which is fair. However, it\u2019s not a valid reason to veto the restaurant when your friend obviously really wanted to go there. The act you had to grind was not worth it but you stuck to it anyway. I would\u2019ve been much more sympathetic if you were just complaining about their crappy service, but even that wouldn\u2019t be a good enough reason for you to veto your friends, strong desire to have brunch at the restaurant that you hate. You refused to see any position other than your hate of compelled gratuity and that makes you a real pain but not an asshole", "It\u2019s like saying that I want an automatic discount. It\u2019s absolutely preposterous", "YTA sometimes being a good friend means thinking about someone else and enjoying their company.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Restaurants should be prohibited from forcing tips as an extra fee.  It amounts to an extra tax.  Tips are supposed to be optional at the patron's discretion.   I'm glad I' not alone in choosing to not patronize restaurants that participate in that practice.", "Right?  People will say \"well they only make $2.15 an hour\" - WRONG!  They make at least federal or state minimum wage.  Their employer is REQUIRED to make up the difference if their earnings, divided by the number of hours that they worked, do not equal at least federal or state minimum wage, whichever is greater.  So claiming they make \"less than minimum wage\" is an outright lie, unless they are not standing up for themselves and their rights.", "Brunch is literally served at 5pm at some restaurants in ATL on the weekend.

The server spends a grand total of 10 minutes with them, from taking the order to bringing it to the table to checking multiple times to see if they need refreshes.  They're expected to leave a $24 tip.\n\nAt the next table are 10 people, fresh in from a concert.  Two of them order appetizers to share with the group.  The server spends half an hour checking on them and refilling water glasses.  Their total tab comes to $30, so they're only expected to leave a $6 tip, even though they required more of the server's time and attention than the couple.\n\nWhy??  Why should the patrons who took LESS of the server's time be expected to leave a tip that is more than many folks' hourly wage, while the patrons who took MORE of the server's time are expected to leave only $6, both solely based on the cost of their respective orders?\n\nIt's well past time to end tipping.
