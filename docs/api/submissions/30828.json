And I really hate to say it but I must go with YTA on this one. I understand that you have a running joke between the two of you, but that doesn't mean you have to uphold it, especially when it involves dancing at a funeral (unless he asked you on his deathbed to do this, but I still would've gone YTA for that anyway). Funerals are not for dancing, they are for mourning.\n\nAlso want some information on this: did you ask or tell anyone else about this beforehand?", "NTA honoured your friend in your way, he would\u2019ve appreciated it and that\u2019s all that matters.", "I respect your intentions, but YTA. Funerals are not really for the dead, they\u2019re for the living. His other friends and family are grieving and are not privy to your joke. They probably agree with your girlfriend and think you were disrespectful. If you asked permission or chose another time other than the funeral, it could have been so much better. Wrong time, wrong place.", "YTA. You should have found a private moment to do it, and not during the service in front of everyone. Not everyone is in on the joke, and even if he may have found it funny, it was disrespectful to the other funeral goers", "Hmmm , per OPs comments the dad of the deceased okayed this. I'm presuming dad would explain this to other family members and would have put a stop to it if he felt it inappropriate. Whole thing is weird but he did at least consult family of the deceased , but apparently dad didn't know the whole story. Gentle YTA . You tried.", "YTA.  At a minimum, you should have asked HIS PARENTS first.  WTF.", "I\u2018m going with YTA.\nNot for doing what you joked with your friend but only you two know about this. For all the other people there this was really disrespectful. If you wanted to do it you should have talked with his parents first", "I had to look up griddy\u2026YTA", "YTA.

It doesn\u2019t matter if you were sharing some private joke; if it was a young person\u2019s funeral and not an upbeat celebration of life and you hadn\u2019t asked permission you probably unnecessarily upset his family.", "NAH. You probably looked like one to everyone else if they didn\u2019t know about your deal with him but you aren\u2019t if that was the promise you made with him.  Your girlfriend isn\u2019t either especially if she didn\u2019t know of your deal with him.  She was at her friends funeral and emotions run high.", "#1. What is \"the griddy\".\n\n#2. YTA.

If I was at a young person\u2019s funeral and one of his friends did something bizarre but then said \u201cfor Paul!\u201d and looked sincere, I\u2019d immediately assume it was an inside joke between them and that this is the friend\u2019s way of grieving and honoring the dead guy. I wouldn\u2019t be mad at all.\n\nNTA", "You\u2019re how old?", "NTA. You said you got permission from his dad. If this is how he wanted you to remember him, who are they to tell you you\u2019re wrong? It\u2019s his funeral. Yea it\u2019s kind of a douchey move to hit the griddy at a funeral but if it\u2019s what the deceased wants, it won\u2019t hurt anybody.", "NAH\n\nWhile you honoured his request, it's something you ought to have discussed with and had OK'd by his family before the funeral. The shock at your actions is probably what got them more than anything. \n\nYou're not the bad guy here, no-one is, but you do need to apologise (in case you haven't already), tell them about the deal you two had, and make it clear you were perhaps not thinking straight but now realise you shouldn't have sprung it on everyone as a surprise. You are grieving, just as everyone else is.\n\nIf you are sincere in this but your gf/Paul's mum can't accept it, it's out of your hands. Give them a little time but don't let yourself be dragged over the coals for a truly lamentable faux pas committed with the best of intentions. \n\nI'm sorry about Paul.", "YTA. Dude, it was a private joke between friends and the other friend isn't there anymore to see it, so all you did was disrupt a funeral for a gag that only you found funny. You're not just an asshole, you're a tool of the highest order.", "honestly... NTA. he was ur friend, i think he wldve appreciated the joke \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f however i do think u cldve given everyone a heads up about the joke", "Oh yeah YTA this is a funeral. Your joke can be a joke with your friend. You could have worn a funny pin or something non disruptive. Funerals are for the living. The dead are dead. You disrupted everyone\u2019s mourning with your selfish antics. I\u2019d break up with you if I were the gf.", "Against the grain but NTA, it seems really tacky and disrespectful but it was a joke between you guys, it\u2019s hard to lose someone young, it was your way of treasuring that person.\n\nI\u2019m sure he would have loved it. Sounds like a rough person to have lost. Hope you\u2019re doing okay.", "YTA for doing it without warning his grieving family first. Your friend wasn't present at the service. They were. \n\nHad you spoken with them before hand they may have been able to see it in the spirit intended but blindsided them with it was incredibly disrespectful.\n\nDouble YTA for saying hit the griddy with no explanation.", "YTA. Even though funerals are held in honour of the deceased, they're actually for the grieving. What you did was incredibly disrespectful to everyone who was there grieving the loss of their relative or friend.", "So what? Grief is not a group activity. If they weren't in on the joke they didn't know him well enough to Clearly doing it privately would have missed the point.", "I had told Paul's dad that I was going to do something embarrassing as to uphold the running joke but Also something that both me and Paul's dad think that would commemorate his goofy and lighthearted nature, so yes but he didn't know that I'd hit the griddy", "Doing it in private would have missed the point. And the only thing disrespectful is people trying to get on their high horse when they apprantly didn't know what kind of person the  guy was or what his wishes where", "He did", "Your probably right tbh, and my gf hasn't been talking to me as of late and I'm worried that this could be the end of us, as for Paul's family I'm good friends with and his dad took the joke surpsingly well but his mother didn't and is extremely angry at me", "1. The griddy is a dance where you sort of lean forward and swing your hands from your hips up to your head and sort of speed walk in place while the song right foot creep by youngboy plays\n2. Yeah I've figured as much and while some found it funny the majority at the funeral included my gf found it disrespectful", "I'm a 23 year old male", "Respecting a friend\u2019s wishes is a tool move now? If he played a song the friend wanted at his funeral, is that a tool move?", "\u201cworn a funny pin\u201d except it wasn\u2019t the thing they\u2019d agreed on?", "I really hope you're not surprised by her reaction, I hope even more that you attempt to explain your actions to her but that you also don't expect her to care", "Your follow up answer just reinforces that YTA. You thought it was funny that everyone at the funeral thought you were disrespectful.

I actually kind of feel like getting mad at him for doing something goofy/embarrassing in honor of his friend is almost more disrespectful to his memory?  \n\n\nEither way, though, I can absolutely see why people would say OP is the AH. There is argument to be made here that the goofy/embarrassing thing could've been something less flagrant.", "I would have thought respecting the wishes of a terminally ill friend that died young would be something people respected, weird", "Well, at least you did apologise and didn't just double down. However this may be the beginning of the end for your relationship with that family, it may be best to leave on a positive note and then give them space expecting no further contact", "I reread the comment and you are right; it's was the other people who supposedly found it funny, not the OP.", "Yeah, if the family were also aware, but they weren't so it didn't look or come across as respectful at all", "The dead person isn't there. A funeral is for his friends and family to remember him and pay respects.  There are respectful ways to carry out a  person's wishes. This was not something that everyone else could laugh at and fondly remember. This was OP making the funeral about themselves.", "I don't expect them contacting me atp and I'm sorry for what I did and I thought it would go over better but I realized after the whole ordeal that this was a lapse in judgment on my part", "The dad was aware and was fine with it", "Just the dad, clearly the dad wasn't reliable here", "That's not what the OP said. In fact they explicitly said \" so yes but he didn't know that I'd hit the griddy\".", "IT they didn't know they guy well enough to get the joke thats on them. Can't get mad at people for knowing each other better then you did NTA", "Yes, he was fine with him doing something embarrassing, if he gave it the all clear without asking, that\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault"]}
