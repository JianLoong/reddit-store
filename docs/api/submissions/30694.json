You don\u2019t get a pass for abusing someone by being abused by the same person they are also being abused by. It is not on an abuse victim to empathize with their abuser, which you are, in fact, advocating for in saying that OP didn\u2019t know what her father was going through when he abused her.\n\nHe chose to use a child as a meat shield, so I cannot even empathize with him as a fellow victim of abuse, because I was used as a meat shield by one abuser to protect themself from the other. The person who stays with an abuser and uses their child as a shield against abuse is worse than the person who didn\u2019t use the child to prevent themselves from being abused, because at least the Person not being abused didn\u2019t decide staying with an abuser was okay as long as it wasn\u2019t them being hurt.", "I stand by my point. \n\n>Person not being abused didn\u2019t decide staying with an abuser was okay as long as it wasn\u2019t them being hurt.\n\nThis isnt that different from the \"well why didn't you just leave?\" argument people use.", "Oh it\u2019s different. The adult has the choice to protect their child who is dependent on them legally from abuse at the expense of themselves, or they protect themself from abuse by being complicit in the abuse of a child and then choosing to abuse the child in addition. \n\nThe adult has the option of not abusing a child to prevent their abuse at the hands of their partner. The child does not have the option of using someone who depends on them for safety and every single one of their needs as a shield against abuse. Saying that using your child and having them be abused so that you aren\u2019t makes you just as bad as the person you offered them up to be abused by is in no way comparable to \u201cwell why didn\u2019t you leave?\u201d It costs zero dollars to put yourself between your child and their abuser, don\u2019t you dare compare it to a situation where a victim doesn\u2019t have the money, social support, housing, or potentially employment to get out of the situation. You can always get between your child and an adult to prevent that child from being abused, you do not always have the resources to leave the situation entirely.", "Good to know you're dismissing the experiences of one abused person to fit your narrative.", "An abuser is an abuser regardless of if they were abused. Then being an abuse victim does not give them a pass to offer up a new victim to their abuser and then start abusing the new victim themself. Even if you are an abuse victim at the same time as you are an abuser, you are still abusive. You do not stop being an abuser by being a victim. They are not mutually exclusive.\n\nOP\u2019s father may have been a victim of abuse, but he was an abuser nonetheless. He abused OP not only in the fact that he offered her up to his abuse to protect himself, but in the fact that he also abused OP independently of his wife\u2019s actions. You do not get the same sympathy as a victim as the person who you and your abuser both abused. The abuser does not deserve the same kind of sympathy as their victim even if they too are victims, because they experienced that abuse and went on to inflict that same pain onto someone else of their own volition."]}
