He sent real nasty letters around this time for \"hurting your mother\" (in other words he was facing her wrath and he no longer had me as his meatshield so he could enjoy a peaceful relationship with her)  \n\nShe recently passed away, and not long after my dad sent an email apologizing for the way i was raised. I was disgusted how he waited til after she passed so he could have his cake and eat it too (keeping the peace with his narcisstic wife but also getting his daughter). So i wrote him back...\n\n\"I suppose you were hoping Id be too dumb to notice how  you attempted to have your cake and eat it too by  waitin until after \"mothers\" death to tender your 'apology.' Youre a coward and a  pathetic excuse for a man let alone a father. Putting your marriage first does NOT mean allowing your child to be ab used. A real man protects his child from harm, even if its from his spouse or other children. I understand to a extent you too were a victim but that was your responsibility as a parent, to protect me from harm. And you failed. You threw me under the bys time and time again to save your own skin. Why bother having kids then? Seriously you shouldve remained childless that way the world could reolve around your wife and her moods far more easily. You thought i should behave like an adult when i was a child because your wife behaved like a child as an adult.  Your absolution is now between you and your maker.\"\n\nMy friend thinks i was unnecesarilly cruel because he now has no one and is alone in a nursing home,that he was a victim too and i dont understand what its like to try and survive a narcisstic marriage, that its not hat easy to judt leave or defend the kids etc, but he drove everyone away because he allowed his wife to isolate him from everyone.", "created_utc": 1699616079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17s23hs/aita_for_writing_a_mean_letter_back_to_my/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact is he is your father and failed at what should have been his priority. Protecting you. I left someone like this to protect my son.", "NTA. It's a pretty strident email, but your anger about the timing of his apology is reasonable. Even if standing up to your mother was difficult, he could have spoken to you privately before she died, rather than denying a problem existed when he knew full well that was a lie. Being a victim of her narcissism doesn't excuse him from a duty to try something.", "NTA.

Your reply was honest and it was everything he deserved from you.\n\nLetting your kids be abused for the sake of saving a marriage makes the Eparent an abuser too.", "NTA He Made his Bed he can lay in it", "NTA, and unless your friends have had to survive a lifetime of abuse, they can shut up and sit down as their opinions have no merit", "NTA. Your response was mean, but your father had 45 years to apologize and make amends. That he only tried this after your mother died is very telling. \n\nYes, maybe he was also abused by your mother (who, just to be clear, is also absolutely TA here) - but he was still the adult in the situation, and as an adult, he failed you.", "NTA.  Given what has happened, you weren't nearly as harsh as you could have been.  Hope he enjoys the consequences of his actions.", "I can\u2019t really judge on this; however I can tell as a ex spouse of a narcissist, I can tell it\u2019s hard to leave. I can tell it\u2019s hard very hard  to leave someone like that, they make you feel so little and worthless and that you can\u2019t survive without them. It took my ex pulling a gun on me and laughing about it for me to leave. But he swears up and down it was him who left me for cheating. I worked 40-50 hours a day my while he played on his video games all day. My checks went in to a joint account which he wiped out as soon as I got paid. \n\nI\u2019m not saying what your father did was wrong but, You have to also have to look at the era they are from. I mean around about the time they were in their 20s or 30s, it was very unheard of a man being abused by a woman, if he would have divorced her she would have probably gotten custody of you. Narcissistic people are good at manipulating and mental abuse. \n\nYou said your peace you don\u2019t have to forgive him, but if you haven\u2019t already talk with a therapist about your childhood. You may or may not notice but their may be small triggers that hurt you sometimes and you don\u2019t know where is coming form. I\u2019m speaking from experiences.", "I\u2019m not going to make a judgement here as I feel we don\u2019t have enough information on what type of abuse you suffered, but I suggest you get some counselling to come to terms with your anger and resentment.", "NTA. I hope you can move past this, but you are not the AH nor are you to blame. Not mean either, just blunt & direct. I had a year of therapy before I was able to confront my abusive parent & they never listened, only tried to give excuses or place blame elsewhere\n\nEdit: corrected spelling of blunt", "Question: was your dad being abused as well?\n\n I ask because maybe he didn\u2019t feel safe enough. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, because I know what\u2019s it like to have a narc parent. I just also know the abuse my dad rained down on me and my sister he did the same to my mom. I think you\u2019re fair to share how you feel and perhaps when/if you feel the need to could encourage him to seek help before it\u2019s too late. You\u2019re never too old for talk therapy and his generation needs it bad.\n\nEdit: he allowed his wife to drive home away from away. \n\nThis right here is an asshole thing to say though. Abuse is abuse. And it\u2019s hard. And you don\u2019t have to forgive him at all. But you need therapy too.", "YTA - not for writing a letter telling him how you feel, but for how cruel your letter was. You definitely could have gotten your message across in a better way.

The way you did it with the full knowledge and acceptance that he was also abused is more concerning versus calling you an outright asshole. \n\nIf you are in talk therapy you should bring this up and what you said then go from there.

That's a pretty normal response to me.  \nA childhood with a narcissist is going to give you PTSD.  \n\nOP's abuser just died.

However, I guess I can say YTA for sending a hateful letter to an old man in a nursing home, when you admit he was a victim too.   It sounds like he was abused and may have been living in fear.   Your letter didn\u2019t accomplish anything but revenge, possibly on the wrong person.   I hope it made you feel better.   As you are asking for a judgement, it sounds like you have doubts.", "Or, and I know your preconceived notions of righteousness will explode with this concept, it means that OP may have been needlessly cruel without knowing the extent that her father himself was being abused. \n\nDo I think OP was the AH for wanting nothing to do with her father? No. However she herself admitted that her mother was terrible to them both. Or do we automatically assume OPs father WASN'T getting abused because he's male? \n\nI also wasn't saying anything about abuse victims needing to empathise with their abusers, I was pointing out that the argument of OPs father not knowing what she was going through can be reflected in the fact that OP doesn't know what her father was going through.\n\nEta: I think OP was perfectly in the right to say no to a reconciliation, and right to say why.

So often, they leave out crucial information that might make them look bad.

Not to mention, a lot of posts in this sub seem to be an exercise in creative writing. \n\nIn OP\u2019s case, without one example of what she calls abuse, it\u2019s hard to know what the actual situation was.  I know someone who called it abuse that their parents made them go to the family cabin every weekend in the summer when they were a child, instead of letting them stay home and play baseball with their friends.   And yes, they used the word \u201cabuse\u201d and that was the extent of the abuse.   It would be so great to hear both sides of the stories in this sub, but that is unfortunately impossible.", "We all have to assume things to some degree with all posts here and for me, I find the absence of subjectivity to be much more telling.
