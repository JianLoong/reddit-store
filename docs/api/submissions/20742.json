And your wife sounds like a hangry annoying adolescent. But if this is happening frequently, and you are responsible for a lot of the food prep, you might think about coming up with a menu for the week. She sounds incapable of rationally deciding what she wants when she's so hungry she's beyond reason. That would take the guess work out of what's for dinner and could potentially help diffuse her mood before it becomes toxic. Also, has she ever been tested for being prone to low blood sugar?", "Yikes. Tonight I'm going to thank my wife so much she'll think I'm cheating on her, when I explain how bad other wives can be. NTA.", "NTA lmao.\n\nThis situation sounds so exhausting oh lord", "NTA - but you may want to consider putting some steps in place to make the dinner thing less adversarial. \n\nDISCLAIMER: This is not medical advice, just an observation  \nQuestion, does your wife have ADHD or another medical element that gives her issues with executive dysfunction?  Because this entire scenario is one that has played out in different forms in my house. \n\nI have ADHD and wasn't diagnosed till a year ago when I actually got a diagnosis and started medication.  The medication has done wonders for me, but being put on the spot to make a quick decision is one of the areas I struggle with the most. Deciding on a meal especially. I get overwhelmed being put on the spot. \n\nWe combat this by building a menu before doing grocery shopping for the week and allow ourselves one take out night a week (Weekends we leave open as much as possible).  This takes the decision fatigue away from me, we always have staples for a \"back up\" meal if one of us isn't feeling it and creating that structure makes me able to make decisions more effectively. \n\nIf your wife also struggles with executive dysfunction, being constantly asked to make a decision when you really don't know can make you shut down.  I suggest, using this event as a way to suggest an easier option going forward to take the pressure off of you both. \n\nAs for the good eggs issue, I can see both sides, especially if your wife likes to eat eggs for breakfast daily.  That said, I LOVE a good farm fresh egg in the fried rice I make when making Moco Locos, it just makes the flavor better, so much more rich!", "NTA why the hell did you marry her?", "NTA she needs to grow up. She sounds exhausting. And I can\u2019t believe these are the things she chooses to fight over in your marriage it sounds absolutely ridiculous. Next time let her go to bed hungry lol.", "NTA. You\u2019re a saint for even making her dinner at all after this nonsense. If someone acted like that around me I\u2019d have just picked a meal I want to eat and made it for myself.", "NTA\n\nHow do you even put up with this?", "No Assholes Here\nSometimes women are just exhausted from carrying the load of primary decision maker for literally everything and just isn\u2019t up for the task\u2026I feel like this was likely one of those times. She was stressed and mentally exhausted. You handled it the best you could. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your fault or hers. When we love someone - we as humans understand that just because we love them that doesn\u2019t make them perfect and will have bad days\u2026those are the days they need our love and grace the most.", "INFO have you tried making a cooking schedule? Who cooks what, on which night for the week? It sounds like there's a lot of built up feelings around this issue that get amplified when hanger enters the chat...", "With regards to the eggs specifically - if you have been asked to leave them for her, then yes, you were TA.  \n\nBut over-all I think you both need to learn to communicate.   You can try giving her options - \"I can do A, B, or C.  Which one would you prefer?\"  And if she says she doesn't care, then you say \"Ok, going to make A then.\"  Or B or C - but the point is that she gets the first bite at the apple.  If she refuses to make a choice then you get to decide.  Obviously, if she DOES make a choice, then that's what you should make.\n\nNo judgement here.  Y'all need to learn to communicate.", "So if everything you\u2019re saying is spot on accurate, no you\u2019re NTA.  \n\nI preface it this way because according to your account, you\u2019re wife comes off as incredibly self-centered  and behaves like a petulant teenager. \n\nOf course the other possibility is that YOU\u2019RE the one who is completely self-absorbed, and likely have zero sense of your tone and actions are perceived.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nApparently you did know the \"farmhouse eggs\" were for certain purposes, and there were \"regular eggs\" available to use.  So why did you use the good ones?\n\nThe whole argument about dinner is tiresome and carrying it past eating the food is immature.", "I wish the worst problem I had was deciding which eggs to have for dinner.", "I'm someone who (for neurodivergence reasons) is indecisive like this around food, bad at interoception, irritable when it all gets too much. My rule, and previous rule around partners, is that if I can't figure out what I want in fifteen minutes then the other person decides without giving me any more say. I'm not being a bratty kid on purpose although to an outsider it might seem like that - my brain just stops working. Anyway, the rule works, maybe talk it out and give it a go? If your wife is like me, the egg irritation was only due to the hangriness.", "I wish the problems in my life were as easy as which eggs were used and arguing over dinner. I need an entirely new spinalchord due to a drunk driver hitting the car i was a passenger in and putting me through the windshield when I was 19. This fully disabled me, and I've been stuck on a couch or in a bed for 20 years (which should have been my best years, not spent suffering due to the choices of someone else) I have to sit on a stool to cook for my family if the pain I'm in that day is tolerable enough, and it takes a day or two for me to recover from something as simple as cooking a meal for the people i love. \n\nCan we trade problems? Pretty please? I'm only saying this because to a broken disabled person like me, this is silly af as marriage wrecking worthy problem wise. \n\n Points for being so catering to your wife. My husband understands my condition and is beyond helpful to me like you sound. I would never flip out on him over eggs, though. I'm just grateful he cooked for me, so I didn't have to hurt myself doing it. Why is she only allowed to eat the good eggs? Aren't you worthy of good eggs, too?

I have a hard time picking a food to eat, sometimes nothing sounds good, I still figure out something I can stand and eat without getting pissy at anyone. Everyone gets hungry, it's not a good reason to act like she is.  Also I honestly want to ask her what the eggs are for. Does she just think you should ask permission to use them? Would she ask you before she uses them? Seems like a weird power move to me.", "PMS makes me grumpy af and indecisive sometimes, but not on this level. This has passive aggressive toddler behavior written all over it. Your post made me appreciate my own complete lack of this type of behavior. I've been married for almost 19 years, and this is why. If she wants her marriage to last at all with you, she should take notes on decision making and behavioral modification. You literally said your marriage was on the line over a dinner. Smdh.

I did most of the cooking in my household and what I made people either ate or went without.  If I wasn't cooking that day they could Damm well figure something out. What she is doing is incredibly immature,  passive aggressive and controlling.", "Did you misspell spoiled child with wife?

You may not like this song and dance but why do you go along?", "I did not say you enjoyed it.", "Beans on toast are delicious, especially when topped with a runny yolk egg.

NTA", "This post you made is going to get you couched for a year if she sees it. She seems like the type that's never wrong and will perceive us calling out her ridiculous behavior as an attack. Brace yourself, or get a divorce attorney. Look how she acted over dinner, and 2 eggs. Imagine if she reads these comments. She'll go thermo nuclear. You were better off picking the chicken as a wife. Provides dinner and won't yell at you. Not alt account 3. I live in America... unfortunately.", "??? Idk if this is a joke but you\u2019re commenting that other people\u2019s responses will seem like an alt account response if your wife saw it.

Good luck with the apology (maybe you could pick up some of the fancy eggs as a peace offering?)", "My 3 year old daughter is in her picky food stage and behaves exactly like this. If you even show her a spoon with food on it she doesn't want, she goes full volcano girl. You owe zero apology for catering to her for behaving like my toddler. As I said in my other comment, I wish my problems in life could be this easy. \nTry doing pregnancy on bed rest and mandatory csections with a spinal chord that was ruined by a drunk driver putting you through a windshield in your teens.

Or pour seltzer water into the good glasses for that special dinner together. (If you don\u2019t have good glasses, go buy 2) \nMaybe Friday nights? A New Romantic dinner once a week occasion? \nSounds like you both have a good working relationship -since she was able to apologize the next morning when she realized she was over reacting.

At this point farm fresh eggs are the cheaper option. At least where I am in the US.
