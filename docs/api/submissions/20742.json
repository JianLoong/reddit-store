And your wife sounds like a hangry annoying adolescent. But if this is happening frequently, and you are responsible for a lot of the food prep, you might think about coming up with a menu for the week. She sounds incapable of rationally deciding what she wants when she's so hungry she's beyond reason. That would take the guess work out of what's for dinner and could potentially help diffuse her mood before it becomes toxic. Also, has she ever been tested for being prone to low blood sugar?", "Yikes. Tonight I'm going to thank my wife so much she'll think I'm cheating on her, when I explain how bad other wives can be.

Because this entire scenario is one that has played out in different forms in my house. \n\nI have ADHD and wasn't diagnosed till a year ago when I actually got a diagnosis and started medication.  The medication has done wonders for me, but being put on the spot to make a quick decision is one of the areas I struggle with the most. Deciding on a meal especially. I get overwhelmed being put on the spot. \n\nWe combat this by building a menu before doing grocery shopping for the week and allow ourselves one take out night a week (Weekends we leave open as much as possible).  This takes the decision fatigue away from me, we always have staples for a \"back up\" meal if one of us isn't feeling it and creating that structure makes me able to make decisions more effectively. \n\nIf your wife also struggles with executive dysfunction, being constantly asked to make a decision when you really don't know can make you shut down.  I suggest, using this event as a way to suggest an easier option going forward to take the pressure off of you both. \n\nAs for the good eggs issue, I can see both sides, especially if your wife likes to eat eggs for breakfast daily.  That said, I LOVE a good farm fresh egg in the fried rice I make when making Moco Locos, it just makes the flavor better, so much more rich!", "NTA why the hell did you marry her?", "NTA she needs to grow up. She sounds exhausting. And I can\u2019t believe these are the things she chooses to fight over in your marriage it sounds absolutely ridiculous. Next time let her go to bed hungry lol.", "NTA. You\u2019re a saint for even making her dinner at all after this nonsense. If someone acted like that around me I\u2019d have just picked a meal I want to eat and made it for myself.", "NTA\n\nHow do you even put up with this?", "No Assholes Here\nSometimes women are just exhausted from carrying the load of primary decision maker for literally everything and just isn\u2019t up for the task\u2026I feel like this was likely one of those times. She was stressed and mentally exhausted. You handled it the best you could. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your fault or hers. When we love someone - we as humans understand that just because we love them that doesn\u2019t make them perfect and will have bad days\u2026those are the days they need our love and grace the most.", "INFO have you tried making a cooking schedule? Who cooks what, on which night for the week? It sounds like there's a lot of built up feelings around this issue that get amplified when hanger enters the chat...", "With regards to the eggs specifically - if you have been asked to leave them for her, then yes, you were TA.  \n\nBut over-all I think you both need to learn to communicate.   You can try giving her options - \"I can do A, B, or C.  Which one would you prefer?\"  And if she says she doesn't care, then you say \"Ok, going to make A then.\"  Or B or C - but the point is that she gets the first bite at the apple.  If she refuses to make a choice then you get to decide.  Obviously, if she DOES make a choice, then that's what you should make.\n\nNo judgement here.  Y'all need to learn to communicate.", "So if everything you\u2019re saying is spot on accurate, no you\u2019re NTA.  \n\nI preface it this way because according to your account, you\u2019re wife comes off as incredibly self-centered  and behaves like a petulant teenager. \n\nOf course the other possibility is that YOU\u2019RE the one who is completely self-absorbed, and likely have zero sense of your tone and actions are perceived.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nApparently you did know the \"farmhouse eggs\" were for certain purposes, and there were \"regular eggs\" available to use.  So why did you use the good ones?\n\nThe whole argument about dinner is tiresome and carrying it past eating the food is immature.", "I wish the worst problem I had was deciding which eggs to have for dinner.", "I'm someone who (for neurodivergence reasons) is indecisive like this around food, bad at interoception, irritable when it all gets too much. My rule, and previous rule around partners, is that if I can't figure out what I want in fifteen minutes then the other person decides without giving me any more say. I'm not being a bratty kid on purpose although to an outsider it might seem like that - my brain just stops working. Anyway, the rule works, maybe talk it out and give it a go? If your wife is like me, the egg irritation was only due to the hangriness.", "I wish the problems in my life were as easy as which eggs were used and arguing over dinner. I need an entirely new spinalchord due to a drunk driver hitting the car i was a passenger in and putting me through the windshield when I was 19. This fully disabled me, and I've been stuck on a couch or in a bed for 20 years (which should have been my best years, not spent suffering due to the choices of someone else) I have to sit on a stool to cook for my family if the pain I'm in that day is tolerable enough, and it takes a day or two for me to recover from something as simple as cooking a meal for the people i love. \n\nCan we trade problems? Pretty please? I'm only saying this because to a broken disabled person like me, this is silly af as marriage wrecking worthy problem wise. \n\n Points for being so catering to your wife. My husband understands my condition and is beyond helpful to me like you sound. I would never flip out on him over eggs, though. I'm just grateful he cooked for me, so I didn't have to hurt myself doing it. Why is she only allowed to eat the good eggs? Aren't you worthy of good eggs, too?

So if you go \"I'm hungry, but nothing sounds appealing\", your body might be misinterpreting the \"I'm thirsty\" signal. Drink a glass of water and reasses in 15 minutes.

If not, they have to fend for themselves for the meal, and they cannot complain or sulk or otherwise make the other person feel guilty for not being able to realign the stars by sheer willpower.\n\nUsually, the person who has an inkling of what they would like to eat or can think of a few things to cook presents the list.

The important thing is to find something that works for both of you. I even had a chef friend who made a flowchart of either/or questions to help people choose meals. (Sweet or savory? Spicy or mild? Meat or veggies? Chicken or beef? etc.)\n\nNot saying this is the case in your relationship, but sometimes executive dysfunction manifests as completely shutting down when confronted by a choice. There have been times when I've been so mentally exhausted that the idea of choosing between pizza and burgers feels like doing differential calculus in my head while drunk. Being \"forced\" into a choice can, in that situation, feel like a relief (as evidenced by you just making fried rice. Aside from the egg fiasco, you said she was excited. Getting food was more important than choosing it).", "NTA, she needs to learn how to deal with this situation like an adult.

The problem arises when my boyfriend and I need to make a food decision together.

You just have to come up with 7 meals you can make them in any order you want. The whole thing with the egg comment was that using superior ingredients should not be the wrong thing to do.", "I recently realized that when I feel hungry but nauseous and nothing sounds good I am usually actually thirsty (even if I don't *feel* thirsty).", "Ooh, this is a good point.", "I\u2019m not mad, I\u2019m disappointed.", "Definitely worthy of the good eggs", "ESH \n\nY\u2019all are both crazy as hell", "NTA I think we all have these days honestly so I think it\u2019s easy to say she\u2019s being an arsehole but sometimes we have to look deeper and just say people have super bad days!! My partner and I do meal plans now Thurs/Fri night that start Sunday and so do the shopping for that on Sunday. It\u2019s super helpful! It takes out the stress of deciding what\u2019s for dinner we don\u2019t live together yet but do the same meals for both of us regardless and we both have a child each so that helps with that too.", "NTA.\nYour marriage sounds exhausting.", "You're funny", "OP is a bit sassy and I\u2019m here for it", "Definitely NTA. She made it entirely your problem to solve, she doesn\u2019t get to criticize the solution. \n\nAs someone who also gets irrational with low blood sugar, may I suggest \u201cLet\u2019s have  a glass of juice (or a few crackers, etc.) while we figure it out\u201d as a marriage-saver.  Make sure that the two of you agree, at a non-hangry time, to always agree to this suggestion, even if you don\u2019t  feel like it.", "This relationship is like walking on Lego. \nAlways gonna hurt ya", "I literally have sensory issues with food and an eating disorder and I would starve before I treated someone this way especially someone I love. You went out of your way to make food you\u2019ll know she likes and instead of saying thank you she\u2019s throwing a fit over the eggs you used. Next time make enough for yourself and she can figure out a bowl of cereal mac and cheese or a sandwich etc.", "Decision paralysis is a hell of a drug.\n\nMy wife sometimes picks the option \"I want to not make a decision\" and she either lucks out at what I chose to make or she has a scramble or cereal. I also don't take that personal.", "lol oh man. I got exhausted just reading that. God speed brother.", "NTA. But how did you manage to legally marry a toddler? Someone should flag this post.", "NTA, and thanks for the funny read. She may just struggle with decisionmaking, so maybe just making the decision yourself is the way to go? I have ADHD and, since I know this is sometimes a struggle for me, I just ask my partner to choose when I'm indecisive about stuff like dinner. He does, and I'm almost always thrilled with whatever he picks.", "ntah", "NTA. I used to have the \"what do you want to eat\" problem with an indecisive S.O. How I eventually solved it was by making (or ordering) food and making it clear that This Is The Meal Tonight, and not budging. There was a bit of pushback, but after a while that passive-aggressive mess stopped, and they became decisive about meals.", "ESH I thought NTA but reading through your replies and rereading your post, your attempts at levity seem exhausting. I was wondering why there was a lapse in your story and then a sudden amount of unexplained tension when deciding over food, but now I'm also wondering how much of your posts to even take seriously. If you have to keep explaining to people that you're joking, it's time for self reflection.", "WTF? The \"good eggs\"? I haven't yet seen this mentioned, but haven't scrolled far yet. I know about the \"good china\" and the \"good tablecloth\", but the good eggs? I buy what I think are good eggs, but I don't also buy inferior eggs and keep the good eggs for ... special occasions? What are the good eggs for? Does your wife buy them specifically for herself and you aren't meant to touch them? So many questions!", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s behaviour is completely unacceptable and childish. She needs to grow up.", "I just learned there are such things as \u201cgood eggs\u201d\n\nNTA", "my husband and I do eat separately sometimes because I am being wholly unreasonable due to the hangries. \ud83d\ude06 We accept this and move on.", "I also have ADHD, and I get hunger headaches, and when I'm hungry I have a very hard time making decisions because even thinking about food makes the hunger and stress worse. So I think I get why your wife couldn't choose and found it increasingly frustrating to be asked to choose. But she needs to work on being aware of when she's doing this and letting you know. That way, you can stop asking her for input and just choose something - which is what you ended up doing anyway.", "[AITA when people aren\u2019t deadly serious \ud83d\ude05](https://imgur.com/a/cGhVazz)", "Still don't get it. You buy cheap eggs to use for things where the eggs aren't the focus? I guess you aren't buying good eggs for ethical reasons then.", "This was a great story, I was cracking up (pun not intended but I\u2019ll keep it). I live in Canada now but I\u2019m English, I recognize British comedic understatement when I read it. Nice job \ud83d\udc4d \n\nNAH, the story was too good \ud83d\ude02 End of the workday dinner decisions are hard for me too. A glass of wine or a cup of tea takes the edge off. Then I can think about what I might like to eat.", "We practice Chef's Privilege in our house. The person cooking chooses whatever they fancy"]}
