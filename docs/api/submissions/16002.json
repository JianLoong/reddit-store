I firmly told her no again, and blocked her. \n\nLater that day, I saw on social media that she posted about how \u201ca new baby in the family mean that we all have to put aside our personal problems and come together.\u201d In the comments she was complaining to people that I wouldn\u2019t be at her party. \n\nThe party came and went, since then, I\u2019ve been getting passive-aggressive texts from family about how they wished I would\u2019ve been there for Sarah.
