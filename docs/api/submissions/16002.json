I firmly told her no again, and blocked her. \n\nLater that day, I saw on social media that she posted about how \u201ca new baby in the family mean that we all have to put aside our personal problems and come together.\u201d In the comments she was complaining to people that I wouldn\u2019t be at her party. \n\nThe party came and went, since then, I\u2019ve been getting passive-aggressive texts from family about how they wished I would\u2019ve been there for Sarah.

That's on her.", "She deserves the block. Anyone who can dismiss someone else's grief is someone to cut out of your life.", "blocking is there for a reason! i think people take it way too personally more often than not, instead of reading it as simply a boundary being drawn. \n\nit doesn\u2019t always have to necessarily be such a hostile or permanent thing. she overstepped boundaries and totally disregarded & disrespected her cousins feelings, healing, *and relationship* over a baby shower. (which i can only assume plenty of others came to, to sit and watch her open presents.) i would\u2019ve absolutely done the same thing and blocked her. \n\nOP; i hope you and your wife have a support system full of light and love. also that your cousin, at the very least, takes accountability & apologizes for being so foul during this incredibly painful moment in your lives. NTA. not even close.", "The problem isn't that she doesn't understand, it's that she doesn't *believe*. I don't understand what OP went through, having never suffered a comparable loss of my own, but I believe him when he says it was devastating. Sarah didn't believe him and wouldn't take a polite no for an answer.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I didn\u2019t feel emotionally equipped to continue that conversation, and I was honestly furious with her.", "I read the OPs post, the reason why she does not believe OP probably is because she doesn't understand what it feels like for him, she genuinely believed that it shouldn't be a big deal for the husband. I just think people often mistake ignorance with bad will. When it comes to family you should at least try to give the benefit of doubt to them. I think blocking her after a single message was rash, I would have tried talking to her instead. Maybe she did not mean to be rude to him. And they both just misunderstood each other.", "I think you're missing the point. Her not knowing how bad OP was hurting was ignorance, but her not believing him when he said it was too upsetting was bad will. Her refusing to believe because she doesn't understand is bad will. It's a deliberate choice to attack and invalidate someone's pain instead of allowing them to feel their own feelings.", "If she was that ill intentioned and she did not care about his cousins feelings, why would she care about him not coming in her baby shower?\n\nI can think of dozens of scenarios which would explain her response, besides bad will. She could've asked her husband how would he feel if she lost her baby at x weeks pregnant, and he answered that it wouldn't affect him that much as they could try having a baby again. Maybe she sent a message telling what she thought expecting her cousin would open up and reply how he felt and things would be more clear to her.\n\nDon't you think this is a bit weird?  It was just one message she sent, are we going to judge her character on a single message that neither of us even saw it?\n\nEither way, I would avoid to taking offense at these things and try to talk things with her to make sure there is nothing misunderstood. By OP's post it seems like blocking her only created animosity in the family, towards OP."]}
