I firmly told her no again, and blocked her. \n\nLater that day, I saw on social media that she posted about how \u201ca new baby in the family mean that we all have to put aside our personal problems and come together.\u201d In the comments she was complaining to people that I wouldn\u2019t be at her party. \n\nThe party came and went, since then, I\u2019ve been getting passive-aggressive texts from family about how they wished I would\u2019ve been there for Sarah.

I would have been sobbing through a baby shower and I never was pregnant no less lost a baby.\nYou can only handle what you handle. Leaving your wife home alone while you were at the shower would not help her or you.", "In addition making a post in order to publicly chastise them is beyond the pale.", "I feel like OP should respond to these passive aggressive statements with \u201cand I wish you could respect our sadness and grief\u201d.", "This and also\u2026the idea of needing my cousin to be at a baby shower sooo badly that I\u2019ll harass them about it seems absurd to me. She has nobody else to support her through pregnancy than her male cousin who just suffered a loss? Like I have best friends who couldn\u2019t come to my baby shower because life and I was like cool beans come caress my stomach and bow down to the queen later. JK I only make people run my feet. \n\nNTA people need to calm down it\u2019s JUST A PARTY.", "Why does he need to \"be there\" for Sara? She's not suffering a loss. She should be there for him and his wife.\n\nAnd frankly I think posting about it online and essentially sicking the rest of the family on OP is as asshole move.\n\nNTA", "This really says it all. Unbelievable.", "Good for you for supporting your wife.", "Stuff. She wants stuff for the baby and maybe for her. I'm sure being fawned over by as many relatives as possible wouldn't hurt either.\n\nWhenever people bitch about others not going to some event, it almost always comes back to them not getting a gift. OP could have sent a gift (if he chose, no pressure or judgement here) and not attended the shower/gender reveal (sounds like a two-in-one gift grab \ud83e\udd2e). \n\nI agree that OP is NTA and every flying monkey family member can go take a long walk off a short pier.", "In my experience, she wants the gift. To a lot of people that\u2019s all it is about. Gifts and money. People actually get deeply upset if you show up empty handed. Like frfr.\n\nOnce had someone I knew but hadn\u2019t heard from or seen in years ask me for my address to send me an invite. No catching up, nothing, just \u201cHey, what\u2019s your address?\u201d and a link to her baby registry. \n\nShe graduated college, got engaged, got married, all of that and not one single invite. I knew she only wanted the gift, so I just blocked her. Then, I went thru my friends list and cleaned it up bc alot of us are reaching our 30s and having kiddos and I\u2019m not dealing with that mess! Lol\n\nNTA, OP. Keep putting one foot in front of the other on your journey to healing.", "I mean, all I'd need is a text saying grats, but it sounds like Sarah wanted presents and attention and to pull a nasty little power play.", "Right?! I have a male cousin who I absolutely love. But like... I don't even know if he knew I had a baby shower.\n\nNTA", "That is horrible, a week after my sister miscarried twins I was round at my friends house and her cousin visited with his baby son and he had heard what had happened and said to me I hope seeing a baby doesn\u2019t upset me and offered my sister his condolences. I hadn\u2019t even lost a child and I wasn\u2019t upset seeing his baby but it was still nice of him to acknowledge that it could have upset me. For actual family members to dismiss his feelings is disgusting.", "As opposed to women who inherantly love them?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I was with my wife the whole time she was in the hospital, only left her side to use the bathroom. How men can be this callous about their own wife and child is beyond me.", "he didn\u2019t just want the baby either, he fully *expected* to be shifting his whole life to care for it. he expected to support his wife throughout her pregnancy, and get to meet and parent a little human. men have parental instincts as well, and while OP isn\u2019t directly dealing with the physical/hormonal impact, he is dealing with the emotional impact and grieving with his wife. if i miscarried and my husband left me home alone to go to a baby shower, i would be beside myself with grief and probably drink myself to sleep. \n\nOP, i hope your sisters kid doesn\u2019t turn out like her. the entitlement is astounding.", "My husband cried at the idea that i was having a miscarriage because i had blood coming out when i was 10 weeks pregnant. I didn't know it was possible to have a UTI that was bloody and we figured out that it was just a UTI before going to get medicine from an urgent care prescribed but the mere idea sent him into \"oh my god\" mode and his coworker/supervisor told him to chill out and go get me to the doctor. I'm 31 weeks pregnant, but it absolutely affects the father and I'm tired of some people thinking it doesn't", "He may not have been pregnant, but he also lost a longed-for child. It takes a special kind of selfishness for the cousin not only to refuse to recognize that, but to publicly shame OP for his need to grieve.", "Additionally, the most important person in his life just underwent what I\u2019d describe as a traumatic event. That also has a huge affect on him. Definitely NTA", "Yea, my brother\u2019s wife miscarried a few months ago and he was absolutely destroyed. Still is. The idea that only the pregnant person should be upset is asinine.", "BTDT - baby showers are HARD for those trying, and those that have lost babies.\n\nOp, just because you\u2019re a guy doesn\u2019t make the grief any less.

I\u2019ve never much cared for them, and when I found out I couldn\u2019t have kids due to a medical condition, I just made it a personal policy not to ever attend baby showers.  Not a single person ever questioned my declining a shower invitation, as most of them knew.  So it blows my mind that anyone would ever shame you OR your wife for not attending\u2014and that your family would support them.  It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them.  Hopefully you both have great supportive friends that are there for you.", "OP was \"there\" for the right people, his wife and himself. NTA\n\nEdit: The family is being so sexist. A miscarriage should not matter to the father?", "Yes. And there is no time limit for grieving.", "That must have been really scary.", "I know right, like what\u2019s wrong with Jackson lol", "Sounds like a floor cleaner.", "Great minds think alike! I upvoted your comment in solidarity.", "I think this is a lovely way to say what OP did. He rightly ignored the vile things his family was saying and chose to be with his wife grieving the loss of their child. OP, so sorry that this happened to you and your wife... it shouldn't happen to anyone. It's downright cruel that instead of comforting you, your family is harassing you. This is completely on them. Don't let them confuse you, you aren't in the wrong at all.", "Not unique enough for people."]}
