I appreciate that you picked a topic you knew and he didn't. I mean, your parents paid you to do his homework. They didn't say that it had to be something your brother knew. If your parents didn't want to be embarrassed, they should've (a) addressed the issue of your brother's ongoing attitude; (b) not paid you nor compelled you to do his homework; (c) made his do his own damn homework.\n\nNTA.", "This is more of a malicious compliance than an AITA.\n\nNTA\n\nwell done for exposing and embarrassing your brother.

I hope you collected the $100 in advance!", "You shouldn't have helped Henry, but at 13, $100 is too much to turn down.\n\nIf Henry were actually smart, he'd have objected to you focusing on baseball.\n\nFor Henry, the phrase \"hoist by his own petard\" applies. Possibly you shouldn't have laid it on quite so thick, but I'm going **NTA** because Henry was overdue to be exposed. This now makes it tougher for your parents to ignore just how bad his behavior is.", "In my opinion you should be given a parade!  If your parents have trouble believing how he is, video him being that way when they are not around and show it to them.   He learned this from someone, ya know?", "I wonder what Henry's school would do if they found out his parents were paying someone else to do his assignments for him?

We need more people like you in the world \ud83d\udc96", "ESH your parents shouldn\u2019t pay you to do an assessment for your brother. He is doing poorly in school because he deserves to. They will learn the consequences of not addressing his behavior. You shouldn\u2019t have agreed to do the assignment when you were determined to discredit him and call out his and your parents behavior publicly. He is wrong but so are you. Before you know it you\u2019ll be away from him.", "ESH you shouldn\u2019t have done the project or simply asked for more money, but ultimately what you did is embarrassed yourself and this teacher.  You\u2019re young and will learn that Henry\u2019s going to crash and burn eventually anyway, let him fail.", "I am surprised at all the N T A.\n  I am inclined to ESH. I get it op,you don't like your brother, and you are a young child yourself, but you knew enough to prepare this trap for your brother and shame him in public.", "You weren't the smartest cookie in the jar, you lost yourself $100. Unless they did pay you, then you rocked the boat and you're a hero.\n\nAs for morals, meh, somewhere between NTA and ESH. You publicly embarrased your brother, which is normally not cool, but your brother and his friends sound like assholes and should be embarrased about it, and everybody's parents are certainly assholes, being upset at you instead of their asshole kids.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou AND your parents are AH.", "ESH. You brother is an AH for obvious reasons. He's turning into a little Proud Boy and your parents refuse to do anything about it. Until he hurts someone or gets kicked out of school, they have the chance to step in, but refuse to,  for whatever reason. You took the money for the project and then sabotaged it. It seems like it would have been easier to just record him and his friends and show your parents the reality of the little AH \nthey're raising, but you went for a much more public option, that impacted others. I applaud your pettiness, but the execution was messy and it didn't help the issue at all. Your parents are really failing you both and your brother is about a year from dangerous.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At that age kids are still basically parrots of their parents' belief systems.  I feel sorry for the 10 year old more than anything.  His parents are setting him up to fail at life, and for a kid to go from a high performing student to one that's failing is usually a sign of much bigger issues than disliking a teacher.  Blaming it on the teacher being a woman is a red herring."]}
