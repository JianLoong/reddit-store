Possibly you shouldn't have laid it on quite so thick, but I'm going **NTA** because Henry was overdue to be exposed. This now makes it tougher for your parents to ignore just how bad his behavior is.", "In my opinion you should be given a parade!

You brother is an AH for obvious reasons. He's turning into a little Proud Boy and your parents refuse to do anything about it. Until he hurts someone or gets kicked out of school, they have the chance to step in, but refuse to,  for whatever reason. You took the money for the project and then sabotaged it. It seems like it would have been easier to just record him and his friends and show your parents the reality of the little AH \nthey're raising, but you went for a much more public option, that impacted others.

I hope that the brother\u2019s display makes the parents reevaluate their parenting strategy, lol.", "At that age, the parents are the problem.", "He's 10? At that age kids are still basically parrots of their parents' belief systems.  I feel sorry for the 10 year old more than anything.  His parents are setting him up to fail at life, and for a kid to go from a high performing student to one that's failing is usually a sign of much bigger issues than disliking a teacher.  Blaming it on the teacher being a woman is a red herring.", "NTA\n\nI'd start filming and recording the things he's saying.  Your parents are swimming with the crocs in denial.  Likely because he's their precious baby and can do no wrong.  Show them what he's doing.  Show them that the teacher isn't lying.  And don't do anymore of his schoolwork.  Let him do it, or them do it.  All they're doing is setting him up for failure later.  All to avoid their own embarrassment.", "NTA your brother is already a misogynist and a homophob in 5th grade. Also too lazy to do his own work. Wow. Your parents are really failing him.", "NTA. \n\nYour parents created this situation, and are enabling Henry in his broader decline. This hopefully will be a good wake up call for all of them rather than a blow back on you. I would also maybe mention the emerging misogyny, because that would really benefit Henry by challenging and cutting that out early.", "Does Henry spend a lot of time on YouTube? Big fan of Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan? If he ever starts using terms like \"globalists\" or \"ethics in gaming\" definitely start worrying.\n\nAlso, you are 100% NTA, and it's pretty hilarious that the families of these other kids are more angry that you exposed their bigotry, rather than the kids actively being bigots in the first place.", "NTA\nYou're full of potential, can't believe you're only 13", "YTA for coming up with such an unbelievable story. Try harder\u2026", "NTA at all bit your oarents are going to have a huge problem if don't recognise Henry's racism and bigotry. Why aren't they ashamed at raising such a poor human.", "NTA Bigotry of any sort should always be called out. Bad parenting by encouraging cheating and ignoring bigotry should be called out.

Sometimes you just have to put them in their place lol!", "Here's a controversial take on this compared to the other comments- ESH. Henry clearly sucks, and your malicious compliance would be well praised on another reddit. Your parents suck for asking you to committ academic fraud, which even if it is swept under the rug with no long term consequences at this level of your studies, is a poor example for them to set for later in your life.   \n\n\nYou probably could have left it at having quizzed him and him having none of the answers - explaining what they said about the teacher is fine too, but telling everyone you did it - what do you gain from that? It should have been clear to anyone reading between the lines that the baseball loving brother clearly wrote this, and now you have made it clear to your school that you were invovled in a case of contract cheating. I've put ESH becuase I think that at 13 you should know enough to say no to your parents when they asked you to do this, even when money is put up. It's not the main issue or the one you're asking about, but I do think that in summation your actions lead me to ESH. \n\nThe fact that you're questioning your actions is a good sign that while ESH, you are not AN asshole, but have done something that sucks in response to a bad situation. \n\nAnd for the record, up the Canberra Cavalry!", "I\u2019m genuinely surprised that it\u2019s possible to watch Australian baseball, considering that it\u2019s such a niche sport here.

That might be because he was just too high to be really invested in the moment, he didn't really know what they were going to be talking about and wasn't prepared to effectively debate them, but ultimately it really just gave them a massive platform and read as tacit if not implicit endorsement on Joe's part.
