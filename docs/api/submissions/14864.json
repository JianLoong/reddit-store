{"id": 14864, "submission_id": "12n8tsn", "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay an equal portion of a restaurant bill when I barely ate anything?", "selftext": "To preface, I DID pay \"my share\" of the bill. Didn't argue or put up a fight. I'm just curious if I'd be the A for not wanting to pay an equal share.\n\nSo for starters, I was invited by a friend (\"Sam\") to go eat with their friend group at a restaurant in the city. After being very sick for years, I found out that I have a health condition that makes it so I cannot eat certain foods. I now manage the condition with a strict diet. However, restaurants are tricky because they don't all have the ability to be accommodating. And I also don't want to be \\*that person\\* and make a big fuss about it and demand special treatment. I'm an introvert and rather not go out to restaurants at all. But Sam, knowing all this about me, assured me that the restaurant would have options for me. So I agreed and Sam made reservations for our group which had 5 people.\n\nFast forward to the actual restaurant. They not only lacked options for me on their menu, but there were zero nutrition labels or ingredients list. The staff didn't even know what exactly goes into the food. Just based on the pictures, I ordered a fish soup bowl, but I immediately had a reaction when trying it so I couldn't finish. So Sam ate it. I ended up ordering a dish with half of the food taken out, which was basically just a pile of loose meat. So I asked to have it boxed up so I can eat it later with special wraps. The server quickly handed me a waxed paper box and walked away. So after putting away my own food, I had to sit over an hour waiting for my friends to finish. The manager purposefully made a point to avoid our table and spoke to us only through her staff. It was bizarre. Sam then gets the bill and pays for it on their card. I didn't see the bill, so I asked Sam if all was well and they briefly said we can go into it later. but it was not brought up again.\n\nI didn't think much of it until a week goes by. Then I get a message from Sam with a photo of the receipt. There was no request to pay, but I already knew that this was Sam's way of telling me they'd like me to pay something. The bill with tax was 180. And the tip was 55. So in total, Sam paid 235.\n\nAs far as what I ordered, the fish bowl was 15, which I didn't even eat. And the \"loose meat\" was another 15. I also only drank water while everyone else drank alcohol. So I sent $30, which I thought was more than fair, considering what I actually ate. But then Sam passive-aggressively asks me if I looked closely enough at the tip. Keep in mind there were 5 of us. So clearly Sam wanted us to split it evenly. I sent another $20, making my contribution $50. And now things are weird and awkward. I don't like fighting over money with friends and family. So I personally feel like it's best that I decline any future invitations from Sam to eat at restaurants I'm unfamiliar with.\n\nIf I had taken issue with paying an equal portion of the bill, WIBTA here?\n\n\nEDIT: I think people are missing the fact that I was expected to pay for the soup even though I did not eat it. Before I could send it back or have it redone with compliant ingredients, Sam took and ate the fish bowl soup for themself. Sam also took it upon themself to tip $55 even though the service was awful. If the roles were reversed, I would have asked Sam to only pay back 15 plus enough 5-10 for tip/tax. But instead I gave $30. And then I was asked to pay more than that. \n\nEDIT2: Thank you for the comments and I think I've learned a lot, mainly that I should never assume someone else will be on top of my dietary restrictions. It's always going to fall on me. I think that's where a lot of the issues stemmed from, me not advocating and communicating enough. Going forward, I'll go about things differently and insist on separate checks.

Which you did.", "$50 was more than 1/5 of the bill, so that makes no sense.

I'd be pushing back asking her what she expected, and yes, prepared to argue since it wasn't discussed. \n\nI'll add that since Sam assured you that the restaurant would have options for you, and it painfully did not, advise them that you won't join again unless you've had an opportunity to scope out the restaurant or enquire of it's flexibility in meeting your needs.

The problem is that your friend invited you to the restaurant where you couldn't eat and she lied to you about chcecking their menu. For this she is TA.", "ESH.  You all need to communicate better.  But why didn't you send enough to cover the tip on your food initially?  $30 for the food you ordered doesn't include any portion of the tip.  It doesn't matter if you didn't eat the soup, you ordered it and were charged for it, you have to pay for it.", "Just because I\u2019m curious.... if you had a better experience at this restaurant would you be more inclined to split the bill? Regardless of what you actually ate? \n\nNTA \u2014 but if you know Sam so well why not just call or text & say what you were thinking. Next time just request a separate checks if it\u2019s not discussed before dinner.", "NTA and wtf would you tip 30% for poor service when they couldn\u2019t list the ingredients of their own menu. I would have said you can tip what you want but I\u2019m not contributing to an excessive tip for poor service, at most 20% of your $30 is $6, sending an extra $20 was ridiculous.", "NTA. You should not be expected to pay for everyone else's food and alcohol but should have probably sent $40 to begin with to include tax and tip for your portion.", "ESH\n\nYou all need to communicate better.  Deciding how to divide the bill needs to be done in advance.\n\nAnd given your medical diet, you should probably call the restaurant, during quieter hours (not a mealtime, but, say 2 in the afternoon on a weekday, after the lunch rush and before the dinner rush, and ask about their food.  If necessary, you can probably speak to a chef, if it is downtime.  Then you can know in advance what to order.  Although this doesn't address the problem of cross-contamination, which is always an issue in restaurant kitchens where a lot of different food is prepared.\n\nYou might also develop a list of restaurants that work for you, that you can share with friends making plans.  Or else just decline invitations to eat out.  Think of other things besides meals that you can do with friends.  \n\nDon't rely, ever, on someone telling you a restaurant will have options.  They don't know your dietary needs, and don't know what goes on in the kitchen.  Unless they have actually been to the restaurant and tried to order something based on your diet, they genuinely can't know.", "I think you misunderstood your friend. You weren't asked to pay an equal share but you were asked to pay for your food AND the tip. When you sent over 30 you didn't include tip. You were five people so the tip divided between all of you would have been 11 each. So you should have paid 41 since you did in fact order the soup (even though you didn't end up eating it). So NTA for not wanting to pay an equal share but absolutely an a-hole for not wanting to either pay for the soup you ordered or the tip. Your 30 didn't cover your share which is probably what Sam reacted to.", "YTA. You pay for what you order. Just because you didn't like it and gave it to someone else doesn't change that you ordered it. \nAnd trying to weasel out of tipping is also shitty. Who cares if the manager sent staff to help your table? That's how it works. Did anyone else whine about the service or just you?", "ESH. You only because you didn\u2019t contribute anything to the tip at all until reminded. And because you could have easily looked up the restaurant in advance to make sure it could accommodate YOUR allergies. You may have been encouraged to attend this dinner, but nobody forced you to go. \n\nAlso, you don\u2019t pay for what you eat. You pay for what you order. So your repetitive mention of the fact that you didn\u2019t eat the soup you ordered makes it sound like you shouldn\u2019t have had to pay it\u2026 which is nonsense. \n\nYour friend sucks for demanding you subsidize their meals though. I never expect anyone to pay more than their fair share of the bill, which is the food they order and 20%ish of that value as a tip (unless otherwise discussed). I know the tipping thing is cultural in the US but I am thinking that is where you are from?", "NTA. Don\u2019t go with them anymore", "I think NTA, but the soup thing you'll have to let slide. I mean its rude that Sam invited you and told you there would be things for you to eat when there weren't, but you ordered the soup, whether it was edible or not. You could've spoken up when he took it and said \"actually I'm going to send it back/get it fixed\" wtv, to me this isn't that different than ordering something and then when tasting it deciding you don't like it, you still ordered it, kind of have to suck it up. But the tipping is insane and $50 when you only spent $30? I mean gimme a break.  \nOMG this reminds me of when my husband and I went out for a friend's birthday, he got there early with another couple, they ordered a $150 bottle of wine that only the 3 of them drank, and at the end they \"split the bill\" and left in the f\\*cking bottle of wine that we didn't even taste or have a part of. I was so PO'd but we paid and then just never went out if that couple was invited again. Uhg. People.", "NTA. I\u2019m confused $235/ 5 is $47 and you paid $50? You did pay your share, more than it in fact.", "NTA", "NTA. Next time get separate checks and hold fast your food.", "YTA, you ordered both items, and not liking or being able to eat what you ordered doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t your responsibility to pay for it. So you were fine paying the $30, but you were TA by not paying a portion of the tip. You should have sent $41 initially. I\u2019d be annoyed too if my friend tried to short me on their portion of a bill. That being said, it\u2019s your responsibility to check menus before you go somewhere when you have dietary restrictions.", "YWBTA. And not really for how it ended up since you did pay your portion, but because you made it difficult for your friend to get paid back. \n\nOf course you were expected to pay for the soup. You ordered it - what you did with it after is on you. If you didn\u2019t want to pay for it, you should have told your friend so and then given it back to your server and asked for it to be taken off the bill. \n\nTaxes and your portion of the tip should have been included in your original payment.\n\nBasically, exactly what you\u2019d have paid if you had your own bill. \n\nIt would have been nice if Sam had offered to pay for the soup, and I get why you\u2019re annoyed at having paid for a meal you didn\u2019t enjoy very much, but you still have to pay your bill.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like Sam wanted to split the entire bill evenly, she specifically asked if you looked closely at the tip. You gave your portion of the actual bill but neglected to contribute to the tip so, yes, YTA for not tipping.", "I mean\u2026you were right to pay for your fish bowl and loose meat but it would have been courteous to offer to contribute to the tip from the start. The wait staff still worked the table regardless of whether you enjoyed your food or not and you were part of that table experience. Dinner with friends is about more than just the food. Having said that\u2026I\u2019m sorry that your friend suggested a restaurant that didn\u2019t work for you and made you feel weird. You may already do this, but in the future I would call the restaurant ahead of time and discuss your dietary needs before committing to a dinner there. I would also communicate directly to the waiter when they first arrive at the tablet that you would like your check separately (no need to discuss with friends; just tell the waiter). Then you pay waiter directly. Non of this \u201cone person pays and the others pay them back\u201d stuff. Keep it direct, clear and simple.", "ESH. You should have sent 30 plus tax and tip initially. However, Sam is being petty. Remember in Friends, this almost broke up the gang until Monica got fired.\n\nI'm going to assume that Sam was probably already a bit annoyed at the restaurant regarding your (understandable) pickiness about the food, and that's fueling some of the tension. I'd be a lot more certain about the restaurant's food before going out to eat with them again.", "NTA:  You should have sent the soup back, not gave it to Sam to avoid having to pay for it, this is just lack of communication.  I think you did more then your fair share and the tip should have been 10.00 not 20.00 for you. Next time be upfront about the bill and pay it that night.  Talk about the pmt before as well or pay seperate checks.", "I don't even have to read the post to say NTA. I believe that you should pay for what you eat because if you only had 3 items while everyone else had 6 why should you pay for what you didn't consume.", "Conceptually, this is often a problem, but I don't think you and Sam are so unaligned.\n\nYou ordered $30 worth of food. You're responsible for that, plus tax and tip. You didn't cover either in your first payment and that's on you. \n\nYou're not clear on how Sam indicated that it should be split evenly and I'm not seeing it here, but I'll take your word for it. $235 divided by 5 equals $47 each. Sam tipped 30%, which is on him, but no one questioned his decisions. Your $30 order plus 30% tip and an estimate for tax puts you over $40, so basically you and Sam have very similar expectations. You really can't hold it against Sam that the food didn't work for you.\n\nYou worked it out so I'm leaning toward a simple misunderstanding and N-A-H, but your question about speaking up, being familiar with restaurants, and avoiding difficult situations is very valid. I'd suggest an outreach to Sam after dinner with \"Hey, I had a fish bowl and some meat. What's my portion?\" as a good start. NTA, but you have to be clear with your friends.", "Yta\n\n\nYou ordered that soup. They only ate it because you ordered it. It's not their fault you got something you couldn't eat.\n\n\nSecond, it's very rude not to contribute to the tip. You pay for what you ordered.", "NTA, even with amazing service, 30% tip is insane, but even if it wasn't,  you owed 15 for the plate you actually ate +11 as 1/5 of her ridiculous tip. You overpaid the first time so her asking even more money is ridiculous.", "NTA and do go to another resturant with sam", "NTA for paying your portion but you should have included some towards tip (and taxes if applicable to your location) without being asked.  I can\u2019t stand the trend of splitting a group bill equally when not everyone ordered equivalent cost items and not everyone drank.", "NTA. I've been in situations like this, and when I realize I'm expected to pay an \"equal amt\" even if my actual order was much less, I stop dining out with those people.", "NTA. If Sam wanted a specific amount from you, Sam should have told you how much you owed. Did Sam think you should pay more of the tip since you had so many problems with the food thus being \u2018a problem\u2019 for the staff? If so, that\u2019s a Sam problem given Sam new your needs and picked the restaurant claiming it would work for you.  Don\u2019t go out with Sam unless YOU pick the restaurant. And I\u2019d just leave Sam with the awkwardness. You have done nothing wrong.", "NTA. You pay for what you eat. If someone needs help paying for their portion they need to ask before going out to eat. There is no need to pay beyond what you eat, and the tip(depending on where you live)", "NTA. The correct solution was obtained with almost trivial drama.", "NTA. Mmmm I would say that you probably should have sent $40 just to avoid any awkwardness. Your ordered $30 worth of food so regardless of if you ate it or not you still got that food. Your friend ate it because you couldn\u2019t and it doesn\u2019t sound like you tried to send it back. So you should have done $30 for food and 1/5 of the tip so an extra $10. That way you would have saved $10 and avoided any awkwardness. Your friends really should have made sure that the restaurant can accommodate your dietary restrictions since they convinced you to come out.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all your friends should check the menu, before inviting you / send it to you, because of your condition.\n\nSecond: no. It may be a culture thing. Where I come for everyone pays usually for their own food. Sometimes we pay for another but we never split equally since the amount can severely differ", "NTA - but as a fellow person with many food issues - you need to get a shiny spine.\n\nAny wait person whose response to a question about ingredients is \"I don't know,\" should be sent to the kitchen with a list of your limitations to confer with the cooks/chefs to determine what they can actually make/offer that falls in line with your dietary requirements.\n\nThere will be times when you cannot eat at home because of life & you need to build these skills in advocating for yourself.", "NTA. You owe 30 plus tax and tip. You shouldn't have to subsidize other people's meals unless you'd all decided in advance to split the cost of everything evenly.", "NTA. You\u2019ve got two options\n\n1.) Don\u2019t mention it again and hope Sam gets over it.\n\n2.) Bring it up, cite specifically what you ordered/ate, cite how you\u2019ve already paid more and then put out bluntly how it\u2019s reasonable you pay for more than what you ordered when that amount is no where near what he\u2019s demanding. If he tries to rebuff, and you want to double down, demand he layout the logic. \n\nHe\u2019s either going to 1) get upset, 2.) realize he has no logical argument and realize he\u2019s wrong, or 3.) (most likely) realize he can\u2019t put together a logical argument, concede, but still sulk.", "ESH here - Your friend Sam is passive aggressive rather than just making it clear with you up front how much to pay, but you didn't pay your share.

So this would line up with a 20% minimum tipper that thought this was great service.  \n\nNow it sounds like it wasn't great service and based on the events the tip of 30% wouldn't be right.

I'm kind of surprised how many comments think OP should pay for the fish dish. \n\nIf my friend didn't like their food, I'd still 100% ask if I could have it before just making a myriad of assumptions, especially \"she ordered it so she'll pay for it no matter what, even if I'm the one that eats it.\"", "That's why I asked questions. There is diffrence between: \"I won't eat it, I want refund/want it redone\" and \"I won't eat it, I just leave it untouched\".  Just like between \"You can have it\" and \"You can have it if you pay me back\". In this situation Sam deserves presumption of innocence. She ordered her own meal, but ate OP's soup because she thought it was going to waste. That is not an entitlement.\n\nImagine similar scenario: someone buy an apple, but don't like it so they're going to throw it to the trash. Someone else says: I like it, I want to eat it. Should person 1 ask for refund for fruits? \"Sorry, you have to pay me back or I will dispose of it?\"\n\nOP didn't say anything about her plans, so Sam had a right to believe it's okay to eat something that will be throw away.", "And I agree with you, that's why I didn't do that.

My friend decided to eat the fish bowl so the staff did not have to deal with redoing the dish or taking it back.

Why was the amount of the tip not mentioned at the time? 20% is standard for good service- tipping over $50 is excessive. This is all very weird. When I go out with a group I always say \u201cseparate checks\u201d immediately when we sit down. I do this because I used to have friends who would leave early and throw ten dollars on the table for their twenty dollar meal- or completely forget about tax and tip.

Stand up for yourself.
