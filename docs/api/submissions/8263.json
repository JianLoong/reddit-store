Your fianc\u00e9 was supportive of you following an alternate path of your own choosing that would make you happy.  That did not mean you had to not get any further education, but to drop the current track you were on.  Your family wanted you to complete that degree so you could work for them in that capacity which if you hated the material you were studying, then the job would not make you happy either.  Your family is mad that they no longer have you under their thumb to control and tell you what to do.  They are trying to reassert their control over you by trying to get you to leave the person who supported you to follow your own path that makes you happy.  If anything the only saboteurs I see is your family interfering in your relationship and pushing you back into a situation that would keep you unhappy.  You can still try to adjust the narrative with your family by framing it as your fianc\u00e9 supported you to not continue with something you hated and made you unhappy but instead to choose a path that made you happy.  In the end your family may be happy in their lives or not, but they are not entitled to force you into misery just because they want to.", "NTA I am going to disagree with most people. Your dad had a very severe reaction to you dropping out, took him 3 years to come around. So he could not understand why your fianc\u00e9 didn't have that severe reaction and drop you like a hot potato. He saw it as the fianc\u00e9 having 'forgiven you' and 'stuck with you' even though you dropped out. Your dad had a very faulty perception of your relationship, which you put right. Basically that you and fianc\u00e9 had discussed dropping out and he supported your decision to do so.  I do not see that as throwing him under the bus. Because even if you had worded it more gently like that, or even worded it as being all his idea, your father was going to have a massive over the top reaction anyway, because all his reactions are over the top and extreme. He could accept that somehow for some weird reason your fianc\u00e9 had forgiven your transgression, but he cannot come to terms that your fianc\u00e9 was actually okay with it in the first place. He can only have two world views, you are the black sheep who has been 'forgiven' by your long suffering fianc\u00e9, or fianc\u00e9 has been the bad guy all along, seducing his daughter away from college. I do not blame you for wanting to set your dad's perception straight, but you need to distance yourself from your dad big time.", "NTA. Aye carumba! Your family, especially your dad is nuts. You are doing what you should, being honest to yourself and pursuing your own interests no matter the cost. It\u2019s up to your family to be supportive of your dreams and relationships.", "ESH except for your fianc\u00e9.

I don\u2019t blame your fianc\u00e9 for being short about your family because you are setting him up to take the hit. You need to take responsibility for yourself and your own actions.

An almost completed degree is worthless, a completed one is an asset, even if you don't want to work in that field.  If OP was in her final year, she would have only had one semester left. It's good enough an asset to hold your nose for one semester having come that far.", "No one is saying OP should have embarked on a career as an economist that she would hate. They're saying she should have gritted her teeth for a short time and finished the economics degree. That degree opens many, many career doors besides being an economist, all across business, government, community development, and many more interesting and fulfilling fields. It's relevant contextually to fascinating jobs in almost every industry, without having to actively use it directly, and she was almost finished. She would have been pretty much insulated for life against so many life risks. It was madness not to finish when she was that close.", "The fianc\u00e9 probably", "Usually 6-7 years to complete a degree. So year 1 credits would \u201cexpire\u201d first.

Go you!", "So OP has \u2018hated every second of this degree\u2019 but did it because of pressure from her parents and she should continue that misery for another 6 months and this would be over? If her parents are so set on that degree do you think they are just going to forget about her working in the family business? That only leads to more pressure and misery and dad will likely have the same response if she refuses that. By dropping out, she ended the cycle of control.", "I don't think her finishing the degree would have made her parents stop harrassing her but finishing the degree would have given her better options and more security.

He wanted to continue to be in your dad's grace. But wanted you to look bad by yourself. Why...so he gets to look like your savior to you, your dad, family and his family. How is he going to run out of patience dealing with your family but managed to watch your dad disown you and belittle you. You didn't throw your boyfriend under bus. If he had talk you into doing something that your dad love, he would've pushed you out of his way to get credit for urging you to listen to him.\n\nStart living for yourself.", "YTA for telling your Dad that your fianc\u00e9 advised you to quit.

A girl was in her final year and super close to finally getting a lucrative degree....and her boyfriend convinced her to drop out? And said it was ok, because he's proposing in a few years? Shady as shit. If that happened to a friend, you'd be wondering if she was abused. So I really don't blame them for being extremely suspicious of your fiance now that you've revealed this. And even if they don't think he's controlling/ abusive, it does make him seem like a really bad influence, since he didn't encourage you to talk to them about how unhappy you were and find a solution, or to switch majors, or even just to power through to get that piece of paper and find a different career. He encouraged you to drop out. In a current culture where it's really difficult to get jobs without a degree.", "YTA\n\nBro what the hell. You were in your final year doing good and you just dropped out without questioning it when you were so close to the finish line? Even if you get a degree in economics, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to work in economics, it means that you have a degree which is required for basically every decent job just to get an interview. But besides that, you technically threw your boyfriend under the bus. He didn\u2019t make you dropout, he suggested it and you were the one to make that bade decision on a whim, not him.
