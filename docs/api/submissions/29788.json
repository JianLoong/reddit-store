There was nothing left of him. So I had to get him cremated.\n\nAt the funeral, his boss and manager came to his funeral. While there, they said how sad it was for my brother to die, and hugged me, then said they were sorry while acting all sad or in a serious tone. When the funeral ended, I heard laughing outside the funeral, and it was my brother's boss, manager, and colleagues. They were laughing so loud I came outside to hear wtf was going on.\n\nNow I feel like people just say that word \"sorry,\" but don't mean it. When I hear it, I get angry. Anyways, I didn't tell anyone my brother died 4 months ago, and somehow, a person from work found out. Asked why I didn't tell them, and then gave their bullshit condolences. So I said, \"Stop saying a word you don't mean. You'll feel sad for a second and then forget about this. You don't mean it, and you don't care. So stop saying it.\" My wife was there and said I was rude.   \n\nAITA for not accepting people's condolences?\n\nEdit: I am not upset about laughter at a funeral. I am upset that a man who owns the company came to his funeral. He refused to tell me how he died besides that he was crushed by something big and made of steel. Not knowing if he suffered, or if it was instantaneous. The manager coming, who has a history of cutting safety measures as well. No one is telling me anything. I was not upset about his friends who came there and laughed. I am upset that a man whose company smashed my brother into paste, so I had to cremate him couldn't stfu for a day and act professional. He didn't know my brother. He owns over 30 shop sites. He isn't sharing memories. He was being rude. \n\nImagine a surgeon who performed a surgery on your loved one, who then died on their table and they couldn't stfu for one day at their funeral or made a ruckus. \n\nThey can offer their condolences but not tell me htf he was crushed? If he suffered? Then go outside and laugh? I had to call a paramedic I knew to find out it was most likely instantaneous.", "created_utc": 1698433899, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hv1g3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_hear_condolences_from/", "score": 763, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It *is* rude to say that when people offer condolences and I think you can understand that, but it won\u2019t make your anger go away", "YTA. These people felt enough for your brother to take the time to come to the funeral to console you and the rest of his family. They weren't lying to you. But they also aren't his brother, and are not going to be in the same level of grief that you are.\n\nPeople laugh at funerals. Often because someone tells a story about the deceased, and people remember and laugh. This is better done at wakes, IMO, but those aren't as common as I would want them to be. You probably went out and berated a bunch of people who had come to the funeral to remember your brother, and laughed when they remembered a good story involving him.", "My cousin killed himself a few weeks back.\nIt took me quite by surprise. I was sad and full of grief.\n\nHowever, I also knew that other people who knew me aren\u2019t going to be as sad or sad at all when they offer me condolences. They don\u2019t have to be. They\u2019re offering sympathy when they offer condolences. They can mean it without being as sad as you.\n\nYTA", "YTA, you're assuming everyone has to be as sad as you. You're his brother, no shit you're sadder than his coworkers, but more than that, exchanging memories doesn't have to be a sad process, and if it's a good memory might even make people laugh.\n\nTaking your anger out because what you consider improper funeral etiquette on someone else, months later, who has no connection, and is trying to be kind and offer condolences is something you need to work on, get some grief counseling.", "When my Dad died it was horrible, but we all laughed sharing stories of him and remembering the good times. Unless you know what they were talking about YTA.", "YTA.  You have no idea how that person feels about this.  They might\u2019ve been laughing as they talk of your brother, \u201cremember the time he did X?\u201d Kind of stuff?     A person at my work has a family member die? I 10000% mean the condolences.      Do you not care if a coworker lost a family member?", "YTA.  I get it, you're hurting, but it's a nice gesture.  From what I can gather from your experiences, these aren't people karma farming, they're just trying to show support.  If they belabor their  condolences past the initial \"I'm sorry for your loss\" I can see why you might need to speak up, but just say thank you and go about your day...\n\nAlso, stop gatekeeping people's grief.  Everyone grieves in different ways and sometimes a nice laugh after a sad event is healthy for one's grief.  You should be able to grieve how you want, as should others.", "I'm going to tell you this with as much love as I can possibly muster:\n\nYour feelings are valid. Your anger and frustration at this is valid. The feeling that the condolences people offer you are nothing but empty words is *valid*.\n\nThe thing is, when people offer these condolences they are trying to tell you that they care about *you* and your wellbeing. Because they want you to know that they feel for *you*. They cannot possibly imagine what you're going through unless they have been through it themselves.\n\nThe condolences are not for your brother as such. He has passed and it is *tragic* and it is horrific and it is unfair and it is stupid and it should never have happened but he is not the one who they are trying to support.\n\nThey want to be there for *you*. And because death is so final and because we can never be prepared for how it will feel until it hits, they are awkwardly trying to reach out a hand and say \"We want to be here for you\". Sometimes that will mean that they want you to reach out if you need to cry, sometimes they mean they want to take you out for a beer so you can swear at the universe together.\n\nThey are trying to tell you that your sadness, your anger and your grief is *valid*.\n\nWhen people were laughing at the funeral that does not mean they were ignoring the sadness of the situation. It means that for the briefest of moments they were trying to break the heaviness of grief.\n\nIt is not comparable as such but when my best friend's mother passed several years ago, we wept through the wake, we wept through the funeral and then we spoke about the memories we had. We laughed about the jokes she would tell, about the silly shit we'd done as children and that she had had to scold us for.\n\nDid that make our grief any less valid? No, but it meant that for the smallest second we weren't utterly overwhelmed with the sorrow of it all.\n\nSo again: You are valid, your feelings are valid and understandable. But do not mistake people's awkwardness for emptiness.\n\nSo, with love: YTA but in the gentlest possible way.", "Yes YTA. Deaths are awkward situations for everyone, and they are trying their best as well. Condolences arent saying they necessarily feel the same pain as you over the loss of someone, but mean that they feel for your situation. Its a way to tell you they are there for YOU.", "YTA. Even if you don't want to hear it, people are being polite to you. It would be rude of them to not acknowledge what happen. In fact, that could potentially hurt your feelings even more. People genuinely ARE sad to hear that someone has died, and they are typically also sad to know that you might be going through all that grief.\n\nThat said, when hear the condolences, you can say \"Thanks, but I'd rather not talk about it.\" That way, the person will drop the matter.", "YTA. You\u2019re angry about a conversation you weren\u2019t even a part of. For all you know they were telling stories about your brother to help lift their spirits, which is just as valid a way to grieve as anyone else\u2019s.", "NAH. But you were rude to your coworker. Please seek counseling for your grief. People grieve differently. And loss effects people differently. Some people cry. Some people get angry. Some people misplace their grief onto other people. Some people internalize it. There is no right way to grieve.  But there is a wrong way to treat other people. If you continue to meet other people\u2019s compassion with anger and disrespect people are absolutely going to start to think you\u2019re an AH.", "NTA your twin died in horrendous circumstances and you have been bottling up your anger at that. It\u2019s only been a few months! It\u2019s not being an AH to lash out in your grief. Speak to someone who can help with your feelings , a doctor or therapist? A lawyer to see if your brother\u2019s employer was negligent. We loose control in our grief, that\u2019s not wrong, it\u2019s just what happens. I have suffered from such grief", "I can\u2019t judge you while you\u2019re grieving. It sounds like you\u2019re still in the angry phase. I agree with the others that say they were probably laughing at a story from work. I want to tell you that some of us laugh at inappropriate times and places. I call it nervous laughter. I\u2019ve developed this habit as a way to deal with trauma. Example- We were driving past a police scene, and heard rapid gunfire. My husband shoved me into the floorboard and gunned it. I laughed to the point of tears. He did not find it so funny. I could not stop. \n\nI cannot imagine what you\u2019re going through right now. You were born with your brother. It must feel like part of yourself is gone. I wish things were different for you right now.", "My older brother died when I was 16. I'm now older than my older brother ever will be, and he's been dead almost as long as he was alive. Grief sucks, funerals suck, I know people expressing their condolences can get wearisome and annoying. Saying \"I'm sorry for your loss\" means just that: it sucks a lot for YOU and they're expressing their sympathy and are sorry that You're sad and suffered such a loss. They don't have to be sad to be sincere. \n\nWhat would knowing the gritty exact details of your brother's death accomplish? Are you looking to hold someone accountable, or put awful images in your mind? \n\nNAH. Boss and your coworkers aren't assholes, and while you definitely were rude, I can understand because I wanted to scream at people to stop saying \"I'm sorry\" at my brother's funeral. But I didn't, because I know they meant it, and anyone who wasn't close to him expressing grief would have felt performative. Would you have felt better if this person who didn't know your brother started crying?", "NAH Why do you think people aren\u2019t sincere? Do you think you hold the cornerstone on grief? You are not the only one with a loved one that tragically passed away. You cannot be the arbiter of all the grief for all people. \n\nHow would you like people to express their condolences? How have you expressed your condolences to others in the past? Do you think your level of grief was on par with theirs? Expressing condolences is valued part of being a human being.   \n\n\nThat being said, you are the only person that will grieve the way you do, for your brother. His death was awful and for that and all of your pain, I am truly sorry.   \n\n\nA grief support group may help, at the very least, it cannot hurt.", "NTA. Different people deal with grief differently, and if you don\u2019t want to hear condolences, you don\u2019t have to. I\u2019d say try not to be quite so blunt/rude, since most people do mean well, but also feel comfortable saying, \u201cThank you, I\u2019d rather not discuss it anymore.\u201d I was very clear with folks after my mom died that I wasn\u2019t willing to hear how \u201csad\u201d they were when they didn\u2019t know her, and the people who cared understood and made it a point to let me guide how we interacted and how or if we discussed my mom\u2019s death. Other folks got mad at me and made it clear to me that their condolences really didn\u2019t mean shit and they just wanted the \u201cI\u2019m a good person\u201d points for saying something. \n\nThat said, don\u2019t immediately assume everyone is full of shit. People who care about you will genuinely be sad for *you,* not because they cared about your brother, but because they know you cared and you\u2019re hurting. Be as gracious as you can with those folks (you\u2019ll know who they are because they\u2019re the ones who have always been there for you in some way) because when you\u2019re ready to talk or need someone to help you *not* talk or think about the loss, they\u2019ll be the people you\u2019ll want around.", "YTA\n\nIf they had just heard about your brother dying, then yeah, laughing would be inappropriate shortly after. But I'm assuming they've had at least a few days to process. Not every moment is going to be full of grief, and people still find moments of happiness in sadness.\n\nAnd, as someone else said, most people aren't as close to your brother to you so the grief won't be as deep. It's not insincere. They don't have to be somber every moment to sincerely be sad and offer condolences.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NAH - it's understandable your emotions are raw and you think people aren't feeling grief the same way you are, particularly since he was your twin brother. \n\nThat said, your brother's colleagues might have been laughing at funny memories of him, or just temporarily relieving the sadness of the circumstances with a moment of levity. Their relationship to him was significantly different than yours, but that doesn't mean their condolences were insincere.\n\nI think you are owed significant latitude as you process your grief, and you would do well to also offer that same latitude to others.", "So when is the lawsuit going to shut them up?", "You are grieving and angry, and thats ok. taking it out on folks though, because they can't relate to your intensity is harmful. You didn't match emotions of others who had lost someone, but i bet you empathized and tried to be supportive. you aren't an asshole, but managing your expectations and some grief support is needed.", "Condolences are like apologies. \n\nThey make the person offering them feel better, but does nothing for the person who is on the receiving end. \n\nNTA", "I think you've asked the wrong question.\n\nIt is a bit AH behaviour to not appreciate that other people are trying to sympathise with you, sure.\n\nBut it's such a minor issue in the greater scheme of things, I really doubt that anyone is going to be seriously offended. If one of my siblings died that way, I'd be an absolute mess for months.\n\nI hope wherever you live, you get some justice and, more importantly, some closure.", "What you are is grieving.  When my son died I made everyone stay away.  I didn't want them around.  I wanted to curl up in a corner in my basement and make the whole world just... go away.  I did not want condolences from a bunch of strangers.  I did not want to talk about my son to a bunch of people who barely knew me and did not know him.  \n\nNow, on to the boss and colleagues.  After my son's service I had a celebration of life.  We relayed stories of my son - and some of them made us all laugh.   For the boss and coworkers, their laughter outside did not mean they weren't also sad and didn't also grieve him.  They may well have been sharing memories of your brother.\n\nNo, they don't feel the sorrow the same way you do.  That's normal - and as unfair as it may seem to you - it's how it's supposed to be.  As hard as it can be to accept, you look up and the rest of the world is trucking along without your brother.  The sun comes up and warms the place.  Flowers bloom.  Birds sing.  Kids play.  It doesn't always seem fair, but it is reality.  \n\nI won't call you the asshole for this.  You aren't.  You're just in a really really ugly place right now.  \n\nI am so sorry for your loss.  I understand where you are.", "INFO\n\n> They were laughing so loud I came outside to hear wtf was going on.\n\nWell, what *was* going on? Why *were* they laughing?", "Sadness comes in many forms. And I know this because when grandmother who I loved so much died, I had a laughing fit at first at her funeral. It wasn't even real to me. That turned into sobbing my eyes out.\n\nI'm sorry but, YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you don't know why they were laughing then you really can't judge them.", "Very gentle YTA. I\u2019ve had a recent loss too and eventually you get sick of hearing \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d or feel that some people are only saying it to be polite. \n\nThe point is people are saying it because they are genuinely sorry for YOUR loss. They won\u2019t say it because they feel the same depth of pain, they won\u2019t care the same way you do and might just forget about it by the next day-but they care about you in that moment and want to offer some words to let you know they know you are hurting and they\u2019re sorry for it. Expecting them to only say it when they\u2019re grieving the same as you is unrealistic and lashing out is what makes you the AH. I would think about looking into some supports for yourself, it sounds like a very traumatic situation and you lost a lot of control due to the nature of it. Please be kind and gentle to yourself and please seek some grief support it is so so beneficial.", "You\u2019re not the asshole. You\u2019re grieving. They\u2019re laughing about something likely not related but you\u2019re grieving and it\u2019s ok to get upset or call people out, just as it\u2019s ok for them to be laughing", "If he owns that many companies then he doesn't know. Anyone onsite can tell you exactly what happened but may not know if he suffered. For what its worth it was probably instantaneous and he didn't suffer. Unless it slowly fell on him but it seems more of an all at once situation. \nEveryone grieves differently and people laugh at funerals, get drunk, get high and all sorts of things. He may not have cared about your brother especially if it was a cheap cost cutting measure that did in your brother. He's absolutely there to save face and can point to being at the funeral and talking to you as proof he cared. \nThat guy didn't care but your coworker cared about you. He may have no connection with your brother and not feel that loss but he does care for you and was trying to be kind. \nYou don't get a pass to being an asshole but as someone who works in the funeral industry grief does crazy things to people so I can understand you lashing out but that does not make it okay.", "The softest YTA I\u2019ve ever given. Yes it\u2019s a rude response and honestly not a healthy one, HOWEVER I do unfortunately know what you mean. There\u2019s specific family members that I don\u2019t give the slightest f that are gone and when people find out and give their condolences my skin crawls. However, I just bite my tongue and try to change the subject quickly. \n\nConsider grief counseling, what you went through was traumatic and you gotta take care of yourself. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "I am so sorry for your loss. You are grieving and your anger is understandable and I\u2019m not going to judge you. At the same time, others are right\u2014people ARE sorry for your loss and it does cause them pain to think of it. They may not think of you, your brother, or your loss very often, but they absolutely do mean it when they say it. (Unless they are psychopaths incapable of empathy and only say it bc they know it\u2019s what one does.) \n\nI can imagine grief too raw to be gracious. It sounds like that\u2019s where you are, and no one really has a right to judge how you grieve.", "Gentle YTA. Anger is a stage of grief and it\u2019s common to feel angry and resentful for a period of time. Please make sure you\u2019re letting yourself feel sad and hurt as well as angry, or else all of those feelings will only come out as anger", "Yta,but gently. Op, this is not an aita post actually. You are grieving. Its not that man who owns the company. They probably laughed about something completely unrelated to your brother or maybe...some funny story about him? Yes the man refused to give the details because.... Which boss will? Knowing that it will get them in trouble and you will possible try some legal action against them? Also as for your surgeon example, yes , a surgeon would have laughed in such a situation too. They are not emotionally connected to their patient ,they are doing their job. Your wife is right. This was a colleague. What if this was your boss? Someone who has the power to fire you or somehow tarnish your image? You were rude and this was uncalled for. Yes that colleague was giving fake condolences, because they were trying to be nice. The appropriate answer? \"I donot want to talk about this right now..its still very fresh and disturbing\" . Get some grief counseling. It works wonders. Get a support group , where there are people with similiar experiences as you. Its okay dear, it will all be okay, and i mean it. Its very understandable that you are grieving. He was literally your twin brother.", "I mean, I literally had four people blocking me in at my mothers funeral service. Because my aunt was carrying on like the most hurt person that has ever been, crying out \u201chow will I ever survive a day without you, my sister!\u201d \n\nAnd that\u2019s a little dramatic for my taste. It would\u2019ve been fine except for the fact that two years prior when my mother was diagnosed with cancer, she said that she\u2019s really really sorry but she doesn\u2019t think she can handle that and she dipped out of my mothers life. \n\nAnger is valid. It\u2019s not the same reason, but I absolutely understand being just so angry at the way people have the audacity to behave, especially when they didn\u2019t treat the person who passed the way that they should. I will not offer you my condolences , because me being sorry won\u2019t help. But I can tell you that grief is like a shipwreck.\nI\u2019m over here to the side somewhere if you ever need a hand paddling. \n\nhttps://thelossfoundation.org/grief-comes-in-waves/", "When my brother passed away I had people that I didn't know giving me condolences. I was in shock and felt disassociated from everything. They're words felt extremely weird and uncomfortable but I understood their need to say it to me. No one is the AH here. Be kind to yourself and I'm very sorry for your loss.", "OP, let me start by saying that I'm not going to pass judgement on this. You don't need that right now. \n\nThe owner of the company and the manager who cuts safety measures are 100% the assholes here. If you can handle it, I would highly recommend that you speak with a lawyer. Money will not being your beloved brother back, but it may hurt those assholes enough that they cannot continue to do to others what they did to your poor brother. \n\nBut. The person  who randomly found out and expressed sympathy over your brother, and you blew up at them? Thats some overwhelming grief that translates easier into anger, and you just poured it all over a stranger there, love. Anger is often easier to process; it feels like you're doing SOMETHING, whereas grief...... well, that's just love with no place to go, and that hurts. \n\nPeople can say that they are sorry for your loss, and MEAN it honestly. They don't know the pain you're in, but they are a human being with some form of imagination, who probably has experienced grief of some kind or flavor as well, and they can extrapolate from their experience and guess at how you might feel. That's honesty. That's empathy. That's human connection. \n\nGrief makes us get angry at things. God, when my husband died, I would get so ANGRY when people would say, well, at least he's not in pain anymore. I kept thinking, oh, fuck that, he would have taken all kinds of pain if he meant he could have stayed here! I wanted him to be briefly in pain, but get through it, get better, live! Oh, it hurt me so badly. Because, yeah, seeing him in pain was hard, but losing him...... losing him was an ocean of pain that I was drowning in, and there was no hope of it ever ending or getting better because he was never ever ever coming back. \n\nI would have traded his temporary pain if it had meant he would have been able to stay and I wouldn't have had to face that bleak hopelessness alone. May he forgive me for that. \n\nBut, OP...... you're lashing out at the wrong people. Your anger is valid. Your hurt is valid. But process the loss, process your pain, do the hard work to get to the very core of those emotions.... and I think you'll find that that core is just.... love. Love and loss, so bitterly entwined that they can no longer be separated. \n\nI know you don't want to hear me say it. So I won't. I'll say instead that I hope that ocean of grief gets a little easier for you to navigate, day by day, and that you find some form of healing and that the love grows to fill the spaces left hollow.", "Awww, buddy, I\u2019m sorry. That sucks so bad. People just don\u2019t understand the twin bond. If my twin brother died I\u2019d probably go on a Godzilla rampage. NTA", "NAH\n\nMy four year old died in August. It was expected. She passed at home in our arms. When it was time for the funeral home to get her, I watched them pull up. Two young men emerged joking and smiling. They didn't know I could see them from her bedroom window. They came into our house and immediately expressed their condolences as I hugged my daughter's body to me. They were somber as I carried her out of the house and laid her on the gurney. \n\nIt isn't that their condolences were insincere because they were smiling moments before, it's that their life didn't just irrevocably change. They didn't just lose someone precious. One of the worst thing about a loved one dying is coming to realize that while it feels like your world stopped and shifted forever, life for everyone else moves on totally normally. \n\nHis boss and colleague were probably genuinely sorry for his loss AND didn't experience the gut wrenching sorrow you likely felt at losing your twin in such a horrific way. Both can be true. \n\nPart of living with grief is learning to lean into the both/and. I am both heartbroken my daughter is gone and missing this halloween with her brothers AND happily anticipating trick or treating for the first time with our youngest. Your brother's coworkers were both sad that he died and finding humor in something else. Both things can be true at once. \n\nI will also add, I have found people generally suck and don't know what to say. Our culture (making a big assumption you're also in the US) is focused a lot on happiness and joy and doesn't know what to do with sadness. On the good days I presume positive intentions are meant from their bungled missteps. On the bad days, I internally scoff, roll my eyes, and send ragey texts to my husband about people's idiocy. \n\nI strongly recommend a grief group. There are wonderful benefits to being in a room of people who know exactly what you're feeling and going through.", "This is an awful thing that nobody should ever have to experience. There is no playbook for this and you\u2019re doing the best you can. Bosses and managers are probably assholes for the way they managed their site. But not for attending the funeral, if they didn\u2019t come they would look worse. NAH.", "You are not an asshole..you are grieving ..your coworker however probably did feel bad so lashing out probably wasn't the best call but again you are grieving and anger is natural ..you should definitely contact a lawyer and see if a lawsuit is possible..work place injuries /;deaths are usually caused by companies neglecting safety standards . And you should probably see a counselor of some sort just to talk about how you feel but no you are not an asshole ..hugs", "Ok, anyone saying he's an a h obviously hasn't been overcome with grief as he has. I am thankful for that. I'm not trying to quantify who hurts more than who either. Everyone handles that kind of pain differently. Everyone has to come to terms as best they can. Be glad you don't have to feel it in a way that makes people judge you. If someone feels like they need to call the pope and tell him to shit on a shingle to try to get through, who's to say, \"Oh you're an ass because that was rude.\"\n\nI feel bad that OP has to deal with what he does. Is he wrong for lashing out? Maybe. But every one of you calling him the a h needs to bear in mind that he, like anyone else would be, is hurting. If people can't see it in their heart to look past what some say is \"rude\" and understand his circumstances, to hell with them.\n\nOP , you are NTA and maybe need some help to try to figure out how to try to come to some sort of terms with these intense feelings. Obviously the people close to you aren't helping things by making accusations.", "NAH. You're dealing with grief so I won't blame you, but people at work DO care (to varying degrees, sure), and there is no reason to have a go at them because they only have to feel sad for a second and you have to feel sad for the rest of your life about your twin. Everyone will lose people they love; everyone will feel this at some point, too, if that makes any difference. \n\nI am so very sorry for your loss. \n\nAs for your brother's colleagues at the funeral - hopefully they were laughing on another subject to avoid the pain of losing him and thinking about their own mortality. But if there was any failure of safety procedure, sue the company's ass off...", "everyone handles grief differently. i dont think youre an asshole.", "So you criticize someone giving you sincere condolences because others (who aren\u2019t your siblings or relatives) don\u2019t share that same deep sense of sadness you feel at your brother\u2019s passing and you somehow feel your behavior was justified?!

You've suffered a major trauma and had a second traumatic experience by hearing those who likely contributed to your brother's death laughing at his funeral. \n\nThis has affected you in a very natural way.

You are grieving. But please understand that offering condolences doesn't mean that they are grieving the same as you- obviously. It does not mean that they don't mean it. You are feeling like you will never laugh again or feel like yourself again. It isn't the same for them, but that doesn't mean they don't mean that they're sorry. Allow your heart to heal without lashing out. \n\nI know that when my dad died I literally didn't want to hear anything from anyone who had not been through it. But I accepted condolences as gracefully as possible, because that is the adult thing to do. \n\nYou will get through this, eventually... I promise. But don't make it worse for the people around you.", "NTA but you could have handled that better. I think hearing the boss laughing after saying sorry was an incident that just got imprinted into your mind in all that grief. My mother always says that whenever there is a death, no one can understand what that feels like except their family and close friends. When i say I\u2019m horrified at what happened to your family and am so sorry, I\u2019m being genuine. I do understand the sentiment of I don\u2019t want to hear anyone say sorry.

I've been to services where everything was morose and solemn, and I've been to services where everyone was laughing about their memories about the departed. Neither one is more authentic than the other. \n\nAlmost everyone has been or will be touched by the loss of someone they love, and most know how it feels when they grieve, or at least can imagine the pain, and people are offering you condolences from that sense of empathy. They know you hurt, and they are sorry for you. Your coworkers may not care about your brother, but they care about you.\n\nNobody else's world will be filled with the same grief, and nobody else will react the same to grief as you.  Their feelings for you are nowhere as big and as painful as yours right now, but their feelings of empathy for you are real. \n\nIt can be hard to see that when your own world is still so full of grief but by giving you their condolences, they are telling you they have empathy for you, and they care about how you are feeling.", "You cannot possibly expect everybody else to be as upset your family members death as you.

They are sorry something bad happened to your brother and that it caused you pain.

A random person acting sorry for your brothers death probably hurts you a lot because you were actually hurt by his passing, so someone faking it is reasonably angering.

And some people really do care when someone they know has a death in the family, because they care about the person (idk your relationship with your coworker though). Point is, you\u2019re obviously hurt for good reason, but you were harsh on your coworker, they were simply trying to extended some goodwill at the very least.", "YTA. Yes, of course, people who didn't know you brother will forget it eventually. However, that doesn't mean that they don't find the death of a person sad, and that they are sorry about it. Most of us have experienced death, and I am empathetic when I hear of it. I can't imagine being berated for expressing sorrow to someone else, or berating someone for offering it to me.\n\nPlease seek grief counseling. I understand you are angry about the totally unexpected death of your brother, but humiliating people really isn't the best way to deal with it.", "YTA, soft one. \n\nYour grief blinds you to the fact that those people are not grieving for your brother because they don't know him, what they are doing is trying their best to show empathy and support to YOU. That's what those words means, or are trying to convey. There's no words really that can say what you truly feel to someone who has just lost a loved one so you fall back on the platitude. \n\nWhat those words mean is \"I feel for you, for your pain, I am sorry for your pain.\" They never meant \"I am grieving with you.\"\n\nAs for laughing during a funeral, it happens. It happened during my brother's funeral, and it was family. But they didn't laugh because they didn't care, they laughed because they shared stories, yet they still grieved for their lost cousin/nephew. You can laugh and cry at the same sad event. As I read it somewhere, funerals can be a rainbow day, tears and smile at the same time. \n\nYou should apologise to your office co-worker. If your grief is still turning to instant anger maybe you should seek some help and support to stand the load until the first wave of pain has ebbed into something manageable.", "Yeah, you are the asshole. Do you know how many of us have lost someone that we loved? You\u2019re not the only person who has had someone pass away. It\u2019s not an excuse to be a jerk.", "Softly, YTA. Just because they were laughing doesn't lessen the sadness, the tragedy of the event, or what they feel. Maybe they were laughing because of shared memories, stories, about your sibling. Not to make fun of or laugh at them, but because of happiness at the memory. Do you have memories of them that make you laugh, or bring you joy? Do you think your sibling would want y'all to be sad and miserable, both at their memory and for the rest of your life?", "YTA. Look, as someone who has experience so much loss in life, sorry does become an annoying word but you have no right to take your anger onto them. People will move on and grieve in different ways.

You need and deserve some therapy to help deal with the horrific way you lost your brother, and the understandable rage you feel at the absurdity and unfairness of it all.\n\nWhen people say they are sorry for your loss, they mean exactly that. They are sorry that you are in pain and have lost someone. It happens to all of us at some point. They will not hurt as much as you because they didn't lose what you lost.

The feelings inside you may dictate yes, but after time of reflection and the emotions subside it will probably be no.

No. Because each person's grief is predicated on the individual they lost, the memories and relationships they had. \n\nYou and they can empathize with each other. You will never know the person they lost, neither will they know your twin. You can share stories, things you miss, the tics he had that drove you crazy, but now you feel like you can't make it another day without seeing. They can do the same with you. \n\nSomeone saying: \"sorry for your loss,\" can and does feel shallow and inadequate. Sometimes, it's like tearing open a barely healed scab. But they really do mean it. Many of us understand what it's like to lose someone they love. Op, please, just talk to someone.", "I\u2019m not going to call you an a-hole because you\u2019re grieving.

It may help you. \n\nWith that being said, if people offer their condolences you don\u2019t have to be rude to them. If you think they don\u2019t mean it, then just nod. And about the boss, the manager and colleagues, chances are they did probably know him well. I\u2019ve met people who say their boss and managers know each other well so don\u2019t assume that they didn\u2019t know your brother. One of the best ways to remember someone who isn\u2019t here anymore is to tell stories about funny things that person did. \n\nOn the legal side, If the boss/manager are found to be guilty of cutting safety measures, I hope they are punished to full extent of the law. \n\nI wish you and your family well.", "YTA", "Funerals are very sad events \u2026 that somehow are also heartwarming events that bring old friends and family back together.

Funerals make you appreciate the life you have a bit more. No one would ever laugh during the actual service, except chuckling through tears when someone is sharing a story in eulogy about their loved one.

I think you might be on to something - safety precautions are often treated lightly until a death happens and they have to change them. So having people on your funeral that might have been responsible for your brother's death, did justifiably made you angry. And even if they weren't responsible and it was just an unfortunate accident - he still died at a job so their presence was only hurtful and completely unnecessary.", "Bud, gently, YTA.\n\nFirst, it sounds like you need therapy very very badly (and honestly probably a lawyer).\n\nSecond, though, you are being unreasonable here. Hate the company all you want... Your coworker has nothing to do with it. \"I would rather not talk about it with you\" is an appropriate response; \"you don't mean the feelings you claim to have and you are harming me by having them\" is not. Your coworker was trying to be kind and caring. They were also just following normal social scripts; it is extremely normal to ask after someone who has had a recent tragedy.\n\nI hope you are able to get the help you need.

All fair game imo. Where you cross into AH territory for me is when you use that justified anger to be a jerk to unrelated people. Your coworker was trying to be kind and didn't deserve that response, and it doesn't make sense to justify your response with the laughter at the funeral. Your coworker didn't work with your brother. They weren't at the funeral. They weren't laughing and being carefree after potentially contributing to his death. My problem here isn't the bullet, it's the aim.

He had a big influence in my life growing up since he and my dad knew each other before he married my aunt and way before I was born. \n\nCried at the funeral but joked and laughed about the good times afterwords with my aunt and cousins. \n\nEveryone grieves differently and you can\u2019t get pissy bc they don\u2019t grieve like you do.", "NTA.

It was such a relief to know I didn't have to measure up to any kind of criteria.", "It\u2019s an awkward situation. People don\u2019t know what to say, so they say nothing.

This has to be truly devastating for you and your family. I know you don't think that people mean it when they say it, but they do and this is how they want to offer their condolences for your loss. People deal with grief in different ways. Some people are lost, some are so sad they can barely function, while others deal with grief in other ways like laughing, smiling, and even joking with others. I am very much aware of this because I've seen it too many times with my own family and when I lost my nephew. That was totally devastating for us, but what was more sad and more upsetting was seeing others laugh at different things, they were never laughing at my nephew, but in my state of grief that is how it looked. When people offer their condolences, just say thank you. If they didn't mean it, they wouldn't say it to you in the first place. I am not sure if you're in the United States or not, but if you are please contact OSHA and have them investigate this. If there is a work-related accident and somebody passes away OSHA is called to the scene to do an investigation. When you contact OSHA tell them you're suspicions on how they cut corners and the safety issues you feel could have contributed to your brother's passing. Ask them to please keep you informed of what they find during their investigation. Maybe this will help you with your healing process. And once again I am so sorry for the loss of your beloved brother sunshine xoxo", "gentle YTA\n\nYou're bleeding on the people who didn't wound you.\n\nIt's understandable, you're grieving, you're in pain.

They\u2019re not going to be as sad as you are because he was your brother. Maybe they were laughing at a good memory of him? Or nothing related to him? If his death went down that way you can always have it investigated then your hatred to his boss would be justified.", "YTA- maybe it\u2019s reasonable to be pushed at his boss but there is zero reason to be rude to anyone else offering you condolences. There was no reason to be rude to someone you work with. they were most likely being genuine and you acted like an ass for no reason. I\u2019m going to caution you against trying to find someone to blame, but Ben if you decide sone is at fault it will not bring your brother back.

You need to find a way to let go of blame and anger and move on", "NAH it was rude, but I can't even begin to imagine going through this. For the record though, people don't have to know you or brother to care, this was terrible tragedy and anyone would be sad and sorry to hear it, and I don't believe anyone would hear this and not walk away and think of it.

You are not the AH for this but you will be if you do not work on grieving in a healthier way soon. Please OP don't let the anger over your loss end up consuming you and changing you.

Lashing out is a very normal part of the process. \n\nIs it possible that you'd feel just as angry if people completely avoided the subject altogether? I lost my father a few years ago and many of my friends said something to the effect of 'I'm so sorry, I just don't know what to say', because I was the first of my gang to lose a parent.

Not knowing if he suffered, and it was instantaneous. The manager coming, who has a history of cutting safety measures as well. No one is telling me anything.

He didn't know my brother. He owns over 30 shop sites. He isn't sharing memories. He was being rude.\n\nThey can offer their condolences but not tell me htf he was crushed? If he suffered?

And to be fair, I think a lot of people might not understand that aspect of it. Grief is filled with a wide array of emotions; it\u2019s okay for you to feel angry or resentful in your sadness. It\u2019s okay to sometimes not want to hear someone say I\u2019m sorry, because often we view an apology as a solution. But there is no solution for this. I\u2019m just a stranger and you don\u2019t have to hear anything I\u2019m saying; but I think it might be helpful for you to find an outlet to express all of this, that way you don\u2019t accidentally lash out at those around you who might genuinely be trying to offer you some sliver of peace or support.
