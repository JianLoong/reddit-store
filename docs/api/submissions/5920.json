We live far away from both our families so we can only pay them a visit during the holidays. \n\nNow to be clear, my parents never 'loved' my wife the way they accept and spoil my BILs and SILs. It has nothing to do with my sexuality. There was no big conflict or anything but they just don't really get along. Everyone in my side of the family is loud and warm and friendly and my wife is more of a reserved person who often keeps things professional and doesn't get too close to many people.\n\nThis year, my parents insisted that they've never seen our house ever since we got married and suggested that they should come over. I discussed it with my wife and she agreed to have them over. So they came.\n\nLike I expected, they felt comfortable pretty soon. My wife has a home office, and she goes there when she needs to take care of something work-related from home. She's pretty strict with her rule of not letting anyone in that room except me. Housekeepers or guests are not allowed to go inside. We lock it when we have a housekeeper over but our kids know not to go in there so we don't lock it when it's only family.\n\nSo when my parents were looking around our house, they went into that room and messed up some of the documents she set up. She noticed, asked my parents to please not do that and let it go. I know her enough to be able to tell she was extremely upset but didn't let it show.\n\nThe next day, I woke up to see my mom coming out of that room. I confronted her and asked her what she was doing. She said she was just a little curious. I said she was disrespecting me by doing something my wife specifically asked her not to do. She said it was not a big deal and that my wife needed to relax and not take herself so seriously all the time. I told her to take that back but she didn't and added that I encouraged my wife's childish behaviour by being on her side and that she was tired of tolerating my wife's attitude whenever she was around.\n\nI told her for lord's sake we only see each other once in a few months at most and if that's bothering her so much I can arrange for her to stay at a hotel right now and they should never come over again. \n\nShe took my offer and left with my dad. My siblings have been bombarding me with messages that I was too harsh and disrespectful towards mom and that I should apologise. I don't know if I'm in the wrong but if I am, please tell me.", "created_utc": 1672306712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy1bk0/aita_for_telling_my_parents_to_not_come_over_again/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Weird that your mother would choose this hill to die on, but there ya go, she's chosen it and will probably never do a u turn.  I hope you can maintain your relationship with the rest of the family.

You didn\u2019t tell your mother she had to sit in a dog cage in the corner and beg for scraps!\n\nYou simply asked her to keep out of a WORK OFFICE!\n\nYour parents really want to create drama and snoop around! \n\nA lock would have solved it. But it also should be easy to keep a flaming adult out of an office!!!!!!", "NTA\n\nLet's be clear here:\nIn some professions, working from home means signing a paper about securing no work information can be easily extracted from your home office.\n\nIn my case that is potentially client data. Their financial status, invoices, etc.\n\nMy husband wouldn't shift through the papers, neither would my children. If I had a housekeeper, I would get a safe for them most likely.\n\nYour wife does the reasonable thing by telling family to stay off (respectful enough of saying 'you're an adult I can trust to respect my boundaries'), while the housekeeper gets locked out.\n\nIt doesn't make a difference if it is for personal preference or work related reason to **leave official paperwork alone**. Your mother had no business to be in there in the first place.\n\nBut not only that:\nShe was snooping the first time, because your wife noted the documents have been shifted.\n\nThen in the morning *when she assumed everyone being asleep*, she snooped a second time. Your mother did not expect to get caught.\n\nShe tried to make it seem unreasonable, but let's be honest, she disrespected your wife, your wife's work, you, and all of your boundaries.\n\nTelling her to stay at a hotel was absolutely the right choice. Your mother can't be trusted around your house without supervision.\n\nYour siblings might not even know about the snooping at their places, or they have another underlying issue.\n\nYou chose your wife, your adult boundaries, and the security of your home over the snooping of your mother.\n\nBut you definitely did nothing wrong.", "NTA. You're mom was snooping and she tried to spin is around on your wife when she was caught by saying \"Oh I was only curious. I'm so sick of her attitude\" No. It is your home and your wife's home, you two get to set the rules. If anyone doesn't want to follow them, then fine. That's their decision, but then they have to deal with the consequences of that decision. Stand your ground, if your mom can't respect your guys' boundaries then she doesn't need to be there", "NTA - You have your partner\u2019s back and that\u2019s how relationships work. \nYour mom behaved like a child and should be apologizing for disrespecting your home and your family.", "NTA \n\nWhat was she curious about?

I\u2019m fairly relaxed but I\u2019m not comfortable with people coming into my space, especially my *work space* and messing things up either.

You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYour mum was digging for dirt on your wife. Since she found nothing so she took your offer to leave.\n\nYour mum is hugely disrespectful of your wife, whereas you gave her the benefit of the doubt.

With work from home, plenty of people had to sign NDAs about protecting confidential business info, and that includes from partners, housekeepers, and yes, in laws!  Your Mom is trying to gaslight you into thinking you\u2019re being unreasonable when she was already told the house rule, touched items, then took an opportunity to snoop again when she knew it was not allowed.

You made the right decision to back your wife.", "NTA\n\nYou established clear boundaries and your mom chose to disregard it.\n\nThe problem with parents is that regardless of their age, they'll always see you as their kid (young and unwise), thinking that they're the \"adult\" and get to make the decisions.\n\nYour mom needs to learn boundaries, privacy, and respect.\n\nI do think relationship is important. I think the best way is to have a sit down with your parents and establish the boundary one last time, and that your mom needs to apologize to your wife for invading her privacy. If your mom doesn't apologize, then she's not allowed in the home anymore; if she does, then I think you should give her another chance.", "Boundaries \nIf she can\u2019t respect boundaries I\u2019d tell her to fuck off also", "NTA  \nI think your mother's behavior is intentionally in order to argue with you about your wife's personality: she doesn't had a satisfying discussion with you about her thinking of your wife (even if she isn't in the right to do that). \nShe was wrong 100% in everything she did.

And for your family to defend her shitty behavior is just as bad as what your mom is doing. Families hate a truth teller, which is why you\u2019re being bombarded. Don\u2019t let up.

I mean did they go in there and just start trashing the place? Also when they came over did you give them a walk through? You present the office part of the story as though they wandered in there while walking around without a guide. Also, if it really is that big of a deal, and the room is lockable as you say, why not just lock it if people are over, like you do for other guests, even if it is your parents? Also, why respond by throwing someone out (essentially, or inviting them to leave) instead of the first time they went in locking it and saying it wasn\u2019t a big deal but the lock would have just solved everything. Shrug. Sounds like it feels a little overboard on everyone\u2019s part.
