We live far away from both our families so we can only pay them a visit during the holidays. \n\nNow to be clear, my parents never 'loved' my wife the way they accept and spoil my BILs and SILs. It has nothing to do with my sexuality. There was no big conflict or anything but they just don't really get along. Everyone in my side of the family is loud and warm and friendly and my wife is more of a reserved person who often keeps things professional and doesn't get too close to many people.\n\nThis year, my parents insisted that they've never seen our house ever since we got married and suggested that they should come over. I discussed it with my wife and she agreed to have them over. So they came.\n\nLike I expected, they felt comfortable pretty soon. My wife has a home office, and she goes there when she needs to take care of something work-related from home. She's pretty strict with her rule of not letting anyone in that room except me. Housekeepers or guests are not allowed to go inside. We lock it when we have a housekeeper over but our kids know not to go in there so we don't lock it when it's only family.\n\nSo when my parents were looking around our house, they went into that room and messed up some of the documents she set up. She noticed, asked my parents to please not do that and let it go. I know her enough to be able to tell she was extremely upset but didn't let it show.\n\nThe next day, I woke up to see my mom coming out of that room. I confronted her and asked her what she was doing. She said she was just a little curious. I said she was disrespecting me by doing something my wife specifically asked her not to do. She said it was not a big deal and that my wife needed to relax and not take herself so seriously all the time. I told her to take that back but she didn't and added that I encouraged my wife's childish behaviour by being on her side and that she was tired of tolerating my wife's attitude whenever she was around.\n\nI told her for lord's sake we only see each other once in a few months at most and if that's bothering her so much I can arrange for her to stay at a hotel right now and they should never come over again. \n\nShe took my offer and left with my dad. My siblings have been bombarding me with messages that I was too harsh and disrespectful towards mom and that I should apologise.

It isn't hard to stay out of someone's office and respect the rules of their home.", "NTA. Your house your rules. Not open for negotiation.", "NTA and I think they used this whole situation as a way to cut contact. Your mother didn\u2019t fight to stay and you have said that they don\u2019t love your wife I am pretty sure that they didn\u2019t want to seem like the bad guy by just suddenly cutting contact so they caused a problem so they could have a reason to cut you and you\u2019re wife off.", "If your KIDS, can follow the rule I\u2019m confused as to why your mother can\u2019t? But hey if this is the hill she\u2019s choosing to die on I\u2019d let her\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, NTA", "NTA your mother is", "NTA, as others have said: You had one simple rule, it should not be that hard not to break it.", "NTA\n\nWhat was she curious about? Has she never seen a home office before?", " Your siblings shud have your back on this or Id be getting real creative next time I was a guest in their house to help show them how house rules matter!", "Yes and I was honestly taken aback. I didn't expect their first visit to our house to go like this", "Well my wife's home office is supplementary to her actual office (she works in a corporate setting) and she has a certain way of organizing her things. She also doesn't like it when someone goes into her work space, which is why she has this rule. I thought my wife's \"please, as I mentioned before, don't go into my office.\" Was enough to prevent the incident from happening. That's why I didn't lock the door and why I felt so insulted when I caught my mom in there.", "What hole. his mom is a nosy snoop who disrespects his wife and home.", "Yeah I clean for people and I would never even give a 2nd thought to going into a forbidden room. 1. It's one less thing for me to clean and I get paid commission not hourly and 2. It's just basic respect.", "My housekeepers ask before they go into my office whether I'm in it or not, even though I've never told them to keep out, just because they're intelligent humans who understand that the room is different from others in the house. How is this fully functioning adult unable to grasp that?", "*Her* mom. Close reading here, I see.", "Is this OP's mother? Because you're defending a lot a very intrusive behavior...", "Wow you added a lot more detail this story than OP herself did. Fanciful imagination there!", "Nope, just another of the millions who read these and have their own takes on the situations, but I hope you feel good about your post. It really made a huge impact! :)", "\u2026no? Maybe you should give it a re-read. It\u2019s all there", "There\u2019s no evidence in the narrative that her parents went into the room initially after being told not to. OP tells us her wife has a strict rule about that room. Parents come over for first time. She doesn\u2019t tell us if they\u2019ve already been warned not to go in there. She just says while they were looking around the house they did go in there. It\u2019s implied that they were free to wander and look around. Once they do go into the office, OP says they \u201cmess up\u201d some documents. That\u2019s a vague term. It isn\u2019t necessarily malicious, and they might not have been told yet (OP clearly tells them this at that moment), and it\u2019s not until the next morning (not the same day) that she finds mom in there again. Is mom wrong for going in there the second time? Yes. But I\u2019m judging whole picture here: as much as mom is wrong for going in there the second time, I feel OP is extreme to hasten to throw them out entirely. \n\nAlso what is the attitude mom apparently receives from OP\u2019s wife about? Is it real or imagined on mom\u2019s part? From many of the details in the story, my sensors go off that OP\u2019s wife is controlling in some ways. But maybe that\u2019s just the nature of corporate people. \n\nFeels like mom is wrong for going in the second time, but OP throwing them out is harsh. Maybe they\u2019re both the AH?", "It\u2019s not so much about them going in the initial time. It\u2019s about them messing things up the first time, then being asked to steer clear, and mom blatantly ignoring that boundary. \n\n\u201cSo when my parents were looking around our house, they went into that room and messed up some of the documents she set up. She noticed; asked my parents to please not do that and let it go.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe next day, I woke up to see my mom coming out of that room\u2026. I said she was disrespecting me by *doing something my wife specifically asked her not to do*.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s evidence that her mom went into the room after being told not to and that they\u2019ve been warned not to. By OP\u2019s own account. \n\nOP also states in a comment, her wife said \u201cplease, *as I mentioned before*, don\u2019t go into my office.\u201d  They were definitely on notice. \n\nAlso, I said they were there a single night -  and twice crossed a boundary (first time, touching stuff she had no reason to, and second time, entering without reason after being asked not to). That\u2019s accurate and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say that\u2019s a behavior occurring too regularly for such a short period of time. \n\nRegardless of whether it was malicious, OP and her wife are entitled to set boundaries and expect them to be followed by adults. \n\nLastly, OP didn\u2019t throw them out for being in the room. Instead of apologizing, mom said it\u2019s not a big deal, that the wife needs to relax, and that she was tired of tolerating OP\u2019s wife\u2019s attitude. OP gave her the chance to apologize, but she doubled down and insulted them both. So OP said if you\u2019re that bothered, leave.", ">There\u2019s no evidence in the narrative that her parents went into the room initially after being told not to.\n\n...um.  \n\n\n>when my parents were looking around our house, they went into that room and messed up some of the documents she set up.
