We live far away from both our families so we can only pay them a visit during the holidays. \n\nNow to be clear, my parents never 'loved' my wife the way they accept and spoil my BILs and SILs. It has nothing to do with my sexuality. There was no big conflict or anything but they just don't really get along. Everyone in my side of the family is loud and warm and friendly and my wife is more of a reserved person who often keeps things professional and doesn't get too close to many people.\n\nThis year, my parents insisted that they've never seen our house ever since we got married and suggested that they should come over. I discussed it with my wife and she agreed to have them over. So they came.\n\nLike I expected, they felt comfortable pretty soon. My wife has a home office, and she goes there when she needs to take care of something work-related from home so she doesn't have to go back to her actual office every time there's something going on. She's pretty strict with her rule of not letting anyone in that room except me. Housekeepers or guests are not allowed to go inside. We lock it when we have a housekeeper over but our kids know not to go in there so we don't lock it when it's only family.\n\nSo when my parents were looking around our house, they went into that room and messed up some of the documents she set up. She noticed, asked my parents to please not do that and let it go. I know her enough to be able to tell she was extremely upset but didn't let it show.\n\nThe next day, I woke up to see my mom coming out of that room. I confronted her and asked her what she was doing. She said she was just a little curious. I said she was disrespecting me by doing something my wife specifically asked her not to do. She said it was not a big deal and that my wife needed to relax and not take herself so seriously all the time. I told her to take that back but she didn't and added that I encouraged my wife's childish behaviour by being on her side and that she was tired of tolerating my wife's attitude whenever she was around.\n\nI told her for lord's sake we only see each other once in a few months at most and if that's bothering her so much I can arrange for her to stay at a hotel right now and they should never come over again. \n\nShe took my offer and left with my dad. My siblings have been bombarding me with messages that I was too harsh and disrespectful towards mom and that I should apologise. I don't know if I'm in the wrong but if I am, please tell me.", "created_utc": 1672306712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy1bk0/aita_for_telling_my_parents_to_not_come_over_again/", "score": 1337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
