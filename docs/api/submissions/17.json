Our house is located further away from most of the houses in the neighbourhood as we also run an equine center. The center is not big and mainly for private clients stabling 18 horses, most of which are quite pricey. My daughters horses are also stabled there. The house, the yard, the fieldsand the arena are on the same territory which is fenced up.\n\nBecause of this and my husband going to work in the city and my daughter going to school there, I'm often left alone to look after the yard and make sure it is running. We also have staff members that look after the stables and horses and instructors teaching people how to ride, but as I said it is private so the owners normally need to make sure they call us before coming so their horses are ready and to avoid too many people. We only provide services to the people who stable their horses at our place and don't run a riding school since all the horses are private. Also some yard staff also live on top of the stables (there's residential area with kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and TV). Some of my daughters friends also have their own horses which are stabled there, so sometimes they can stay over at ours over the weekends or holidays.\n\nBecause of all the above and alongside with security cameras, we also have 4 guard dogs (causasian and middle Asian shepards) which we let roam free on the territory during night or when we don't have a lot of owners around. The dogs are familiar with all the kids (my daughter and her friends), the owners and the members of staff working at the yard, in fact they are very friendly to them. However they are guard dogs so they are ready to protect the property.\n\nOne of the neighbours kids became notorious at trying to climb over the fence to look at the horses, even after multiple warnings not to do that. On Friday they have managed to get through during the evening, so our dogs cornered them and didn't let them move. I have only find out about it after hearing police sirens coming to the property. Apparently they were cornered for a while and since the dogs won't let them out, their mother had to call the police. I took the dogs away so the kids could go and the police officer said I did nothing wrong, since guard dogs are allowed. But the mother has tried to pull the card how traumatised the kids are and the dogs should be taken care of and I laughed and reminded her they have been warned multiple times. She started spreading the rumours and they made it to the local newspaper saying I'm the asshole.", "created_utc": 1667220354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yib16y/aita_for_laughing_at_my_neighbours_face_after_she/", "score": 4825, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because we've had issues with people for similar reasons we always make sure we do this and it's worked well.", "NTA. But if there are no CONSEQUENCES for the child's tresspassing, you may be establishing a precedent you may regret later. At the very least, get the police report and tell the parents that if their child is found trespassing on your property again, you will press charges for BOTH instances. \n\nYou may also wish to get ahead of the neighborhood gossip by offering copies of the police report to anyone who seems interested.

Our house is located further away from most of the houses in the neighbourhood as we also run an equine center. The center is not big and mainly for private clients stabling 18 horses, most of which are quite pricey. My daughters horses are also stabled there. The house, the yard, the fieldsand the arena are on the same territory which is fenced up.\n\nBecause of this and my husband going to work in the city and my daughter going to school there, I'm often left alone to look after the yard and make sure it is running. We also have staff members that look after the stables and horses and instructors teaching people how to ride, but as I said it is private so the owners normally need to make sure they call us before coming so their horses are ready and to avoid too many people. We only provide services to the people who stable their horses at our place and don't run a riding school since all the horses are private. Also some yard staff also live on top of the stables (there's residential area with kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and TV). Some of my daughters friends also have their own horses which are stabled there, so sometimes they can stay over at ours over the weekends or holidays.\n\nBecause of all the above and alongside with security cameras, we also have 4 guard dogs (causasian and middle Asian shepards) which we let roam free on the territory during night or when we don't have a lot of owners around. The dogs are familiar with all the kids (my daughter and her friends), the owners and the members of staff working at the yard, in fact they are very friendly to them. However they are guard dogs so they are ready to protect the property.\n\nOne of the neighbours kids became notorious at trying to climb over the fence to look at the horses, even after multiple warnings not to do that. On Friday they have managed to get through during the evening, so our dogs cornered them and didn't let them move. I have only find out about it after hearing police sirens coming to the property. Apparently they were cornered for a while and since the dogs won't let them out, their mother had to call the police. I took the dogs away so the kids could go and the police officer said I did nothing wrong, since guard dogs are allowed. But the mother has tried to pull the card how traumatised the kids are and the dogs should be taken care of and I laughed and reminded her they have been warned multiple times.

Send a certified cease and desist style letter regarding the trespassing.", "This is an EXCELLENT point. thanks very much for sharing.", "Trust me when I tell you the only people who care about signs are insurance companies ... and they won\u2019t help you protect your dogs or save you from the media", "I would also do motion-sensor lights on the signs. They make reasonably good, solar powered, cheap ones these days.", "Yeah, I should revise. Didn't feel like looking up case law, statutes etc. But its true. Edited accordingly.", "Copied from previous post below", "Bot", "I bet the mom is a nitwit and would violate the restraining order. But this way there would be a paper trail to protect OP.", "Caucasian Shepards are fuckin gigantic too, if the kids were younger teens they could easily have been outweighed.", "Yes please, and maybe a horse tax too.", "Great point!", "I've lost teeth from the horse moving her head too fast. And she wasn't even using much force, just turning to look. \n\nThey are huge, powerful animals and not to mess around with.", "Yeah I know someone who went after a horse that knew him very well when it got out. Wrong place, wrong time and he was in the hospital for 3 months with a subdural hematoma, on experimental drugs. Had his 10th birthday in the hospital. \n\nIt can absolutely kill you, easily.", "Lol... well I meant the signs every ten feet (added quotes for clarity), but more dogs is also an option. Maybe a few new pups and get those horses trained to patrol as well. \n\nNext time that kid tries to tresspass there will be a line of horses and dog sentries lined up and ready to rumble behind an electric fence with \"do you feel lucky punk\" in their eyes!", "Doesn't mean that she won't try. People just don't want to take responsibility for themselves. One guy tried to sue the company he worked for when he was driving his work car and backed into his personal car.", "That would be great. However counting on parents being reasonable is a losing bet.", "That's my question. It certainly seems like she must have been because how else did she know to call the police?", "She said in another comment that with the way her property is set up, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to see/ hear them with where they were. Someone would\u2019ve had to call her on her intercom.", "Being from a small town, it probably printed the police report, part of which was the mom\u2019s statement.", ">Many small, local papers still print police blotters that often contain very little additional context about a police call beyond that it happened. That's not defamation (or libel, which would be the more relevant suit if your target is the paper.),\n\n[Yeah this scene basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XscaGDxuQqE)", "That's how my hometown paper's police blotter works-there's just a bit of 'X was arrested on a Y county warrant/Y city warrant and transported to county/city jail' as well as 'this or that business was robbed on this date' and 'so-and-so called to report that someone had broken into their home/stolen their identity and made fraudulent charges with their credit/debit card/had issues with a neighbor about this or that issue'. There's some domestic violence and drug issues as well, along with the occasional truancy report. We're pretty lucky; the last murder was close to 20 years ago and I believe it made the news because it happens so rarely here.", "Same here. I'm guessing police blotter.", "\"Area woman found to be asshole\"", "This is partially incorrect. Actual malice only has to be proven if the person doing the suing is considered a public figure (like, a politician, actor, actress, etc.). OP is just a private citizen, so she would only have to prove that she/her business suffered actual damages (loss of revenue, customers, etc) from the false statements.", "I don't think OP would win, but it's better to ask a lawyer what their opinion is for dealing with it than reddit anyway. OP can afford a consult if they can house so many horses.", "Or even just send in a letter to the editor or something to clear things up.", "It depends on what the \"rumors\" are. If they're saying \"I think OP is an asshole for having guard dogs\" that's obviously not defamation. If they're saying \"OP keeps dangerous attack dogs that are threatening the neighborhood children\" that's a lot more questionable.", "sure, except that's not what happened", "How the fuck did I find you in the wild!!!!!", "So long as thats all it is.. an editorial. Anything else is slander.", "Possibly but I would rather overload with precautions than have someone get away with something over a \"loophole.\" In my area the signs go a long way!", "Jesus, I've just gone googling and I think those things could outweigh a decent adult! Although the ones in the pictures look more likely to slobber someone to death than attack them.", "They're bigger than some 30 year olds I know", "Just googled and holy shit those things are huge!! Where does one get one", "Those gigantic dogs weigh more than me \ud83d\ude2d", "I got a brain injury from a cow gently looking around and my face being too close to it when i was trying to get it unstuck. Dont fuck with large animals", "Maybe mix in a few llamas?", "Thanks, I didn't read all of the comments. It just seems like a very long time to me. It doesn't make sense to me, would an  intruder have to call from the intercom to get the dogs to back off? How do they get to the intercom if the dogs are containing them? I don't think intruding is acceptable in any way and I think the dogs are just doing their job but it still seems like an absurdly long amount of time. If the kids were right next to where they came over the fence initially wouldn't they attempt to go back over it the rest they came in? Some of this just isn't adding up to me and seems fake.", "Eh, I'd be surprised if they're printing a full report with no additional reporting on their part. Printing just a straight full report would be outside the industry norm.   \n\n\nNow I wouldn't be surprised at all if they printed a blotter item along the lines of \"XYZ reported dangerous dogs cornering her child at ABCD farm.\"", "By those lines of reasoning though wouldnt it report. Person trespassing calls police on guard dogs. Removed for tresspassing. There putting it more in OPs favour, which doesnt seem to be what they're saying here", "It would be questionable, but likely still not quite there.  Maybe if it said OP uses attack dogs to catch children so OP can eat them, as OP is known to do... She'd still have to have clear evidence of detriment caused by the editorial.  Boarders pulling out, that sort of thing.  It's tough, but it should be as it's a constitutionally protected right.", "What did happen then?", "No, slander is spoken. \n\nIt *could* be libel, but that would depend on OP's location and what was written in the paper.", "I train dogs on my property (10 acres in the woods) have signs posted everywhere (mostly for hunters) They are there to protect me financially but I know if one of my dogs attacks someone or just corners someone I\u2019m still going to be accountable somehow.", "They\u2019re likely to slobber you to death if you are family. If you are not\u2026 not so much. OP\u2019s dogs must be insanely well trained to just have cornered the trespassing kid as they are a very *very* protective and territorial breed. \n\nSource: my grandparents used to own Caucasian Shepards", "They\u2019re working dogs and generally work guarding sheep or other animals. Generally they aren\u2019t family pets and tend to do badly as just \u201cpets\u201d but rather are raised with the flock they\u2019d guard. Those are a breed I\u2019d stay away from if I ever met them, and they\u2019re illegal to own in several countries here in Europe. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re amazing guard dogs though - but don\u2019t get close enough to find out", "I've met a Caucasian shepherd mix and she definitely almost outweighed me. Beautiful dogs but I'd never want to get on their bad side.", "And less hairy.", "Costco has like 48-packs I think.", "Well if you take into account exactly how munch land she would have to own to even house that many horses and allow her dogs to roam freely,  it\u2019s actually perfectly reasonable. Lots of people with horses have tons of acres of land and if they\u2019re over in one section of her property and she\u2019s inside of her house on a completely different section, then no she wouldn\u2019t be able to hear. Obviously the intercom isnt for intruders, but for invited guests\u2026 she just said had the mom came and called her on the intercom she could\u2019ve gotten the dogs sooner.", "An intruder who\u2019s not a child would likely have a cell phone. It kind of amuses me that they\u2019d either have to wait until morning when someone went out to work or call 911. Entitled mom chose the later.", "There\u2019s a difference between small town and industry norm, lol. \n\nOur hometown paper had a social column for years that was literally \u201cJohnny had a sleepover at his grandma\u2019s last Tuesday. They had pizza and watched the newest Disney release.\u201d \n\nWhere there\u2019s not news, anything can be news.", "Pretty sure it comes down to \"will/did the OP lose clients because of the rumours/printed story?\"... Defamation has to have a very blatant impact on their reputation for it to be something you can sue over and get results. \n\nIf the neighbour did the whole \"OP has vicious dogs that will corner and attack children on their property\" and that caused people to remove their horses from OP's stables, or new clients from going elsewhere to house their animals, then OP has a case.\n\nOtherwise it's just a PITA.\n\nOP Still is NTA.", "It\u2019s even harder, you also have to prove she knew it was a lie when she said it, and that it wasn\u2019t intended as satire", "That's not okay. You should not be liable on your property, if the dogs get out that is another issue. We have property also, not as much as you though. I can only speak for our area but the signs do go a long way.", "Ahh I\u2019ll have to check my local store!", "One time I saw a newspaper story about a guy who thought he had picked limes, but they were actually unripe lemons. Slow news in a small place is *slow.*", "A small town I once lived in had a column exactly like this. I was from a fairly big city and this was hilarious to me lol.", "Oh I agree 100% ... shouldn\u2019t ever be an issue. But there are a lot of assholes in the world that will make it an issue. We had 2 hunters come out of the woods with guns into my yard (it\u2019s a very big yard like acre & a half) my kids were young & outside. I let my own personal dogs out (not my training dogs) & they chased them off our property. They called the police on me because they felt threatened. People are idiots", "Totally agree! People are idiots! I hope you told the police you and your kids felt threatened because they had guns. Morons....\nMy husband is a hunter. He is super careful to make sure he stays on public hunting land only. He has a Garmin and an app on his phone to help make sure he is in the right spot if he isn't familiar with the area. Before all that was available he used maps.", "Your husband is a good man! We also hunt & always ensure we are on \u201csafe\u201d property!", "We live in a very small mountain town ... like 1,200 ppl. I wasn\u2019t worried too much about police (there are only 2 ppl full-time. I know both very well) but those 2 hunters spun the story to reflect their feelings & I have no doubt that my 3 dogs chasing them was not pleasant for them. But that\u2019s kind of my point.... regardless of whether or not I\u2019m legally right, public opinion can change that very quickly. Facts don\u2019t matter anymore", "NtA", "Nta\u2026. I would contact the news paper and threaten to sue them unless they print the real story of children trespassing and endangering clients horses the dogs were doing their job nothing more nothing less I\u2019d also sue the mother for slander", "Press charge NOW. This reached the news. There\u2019s a huge case of defamation waiting here", "Oh, for sure on the trespassing. Your dogs had a job, they dif their job. Good dogs! Shame on the mum for not impressing on her child don't go somewhere you're not allowed."]}
