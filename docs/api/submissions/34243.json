I asked her if she went to her sister or or her mom, but apparently, her mom's boyfriend doesn't like her and her sister has told her before \"If dad ever kicks you out, you will deal with it by yourself\". While I feel for her, we are 22 and she has been working here and there since graduation. And then she showed me that she only has 2 coins left in her bank account. She has the mentality of a kid and always spent tons of money on dumb things instead of trying to fix her life. Back in high-school, we were friends for a bit because I felt sorry for her, even the class bullied her, but that was because she was seeking attention in the most childish, annoying ways possible. And to her everyone else was always guilty but not her. And she wanted me to buy her lunch because she was saving money for an iPhone. So I dropped her after a while. I didn't tell her that I don't want to be friends with her, but I started avoiding her and always told her I'm busy when she wanted to hang out. Yet, she kept begging me to go out, even when I said I don't want to so I just started to ignore her and she stopped. But yeah, she texted me yesterday. She didn't directly ask me to move in with me but I think she meant it because she told me she haven't told her mom or sis yet. If it was one of my friends I would have taken them in right away. In the end, if they really don't want her, I will take her in, I won't leave her out in the cold.  But it's just that I really don't want to.

Which, to be clear, you would have no reason to feel guilty here.)\n\nSave your resources (time, money, and \u201cgiving nature\u201d) for people who are in your circle of responsibility. If you \u201cspend\u201d them on this woman who is not, you might not be able to help someone in the future who is.", "NTA - her own family won\u2019t take her in, probably because of her immaturity.\n\nShe will never pay you rent, never help out with chores, she will never leave. She will leech off you for as long and for as much as she can. \n\nYou are not responsible for her. You should not let her move in.", "NTA\u2026stay far away from this drama queen.  Block her, ignore, just say, nope, cannot live with you.", "NTA - The best thing you can do for this girl is to not take her in. She's made very poor choices and needs to get her life together on her own. She sounds like the type of person that will suck the life out of any situation that she can take advantage of. At 22 she should be holding down a job and paying her own way, instead of leaching off of others. Do not let her move in or you'll regret it.", "NTA she's not a friend, she WAS a friend and you stopped. it says a lot about her that her own family won't take her in and she doesn't have current friends who will help her out that she's reduced to calling 'that person i knew in hs.\" \n\nmy bet is if she moves in she won't move out.", "NTA\n\nyou have the right to have privacy in your own house, and you're not obliged to let your friend live in YOUR house. If she's reckless, let her learn her lesson.", "NTA\n\nBut you sound like a people pleaser/pretty conflict-avoident. There is a reason no one in her family wants to take her in. It wouldn't surprise me if her dad is kicking her out because she refuses to pay anything towards her living expenses.", "NTA\n\nShe is 22, an adult.  She needs to wake up, pull up her big girl pants and start to adult.", "NTA you have no obligation to take her in. In fact, you would only further enable her. She\u2019s 22, not 16. She needs to start behaving like an adult and responsible for her life. She may have to go to a women\u2019s shelter for a few weeks until she saves enough to rent a room somewhere.", "Once she\u2019s in she won\u2019t get out so don\u2019t let her in instead be the guider for this poor soul and direct her to resources she can get, jobs she can find and potentially good habit she should form. whatever you do don\u2019t let her into your house.", "NTA.  People are responsible for their own circumstances.  If they have cultivated good enough relations with people who *may* want to help her, but they are in no way obliged.", "Be a pal and get a list together. Women\u2019s shelters. Job listings with the state. The employment website of the three biggest employers in your city who hire on the spot. \n\nIn Florida, the resource is called CareerSource. It has instant employment postings (such as fast food), hiring all the time. It also has training programs for high-wage trades like welding or mechanic. \n\nUnited Way 2-1-1 can help with housing and utilities deposits. She can do this on her own. No need to be her caretaker.", "NTA - but don't be an idiot.  Don't randomly let some person you barely know that you don't even like move in with you.  Seriously, don't be that stupid.  There is no way that ends well.", "NTA and do not let her move in with you. She'll say it's only temporary but it could be months or years from now and she'll still be there. She'll blow her money on stuff she doesn't need and expect you to pay all the bills.", "NTA and don\u2019t take her in or you will NEVER get her back out. If she asks you to directly, reference whatever local shelter there is. Some person you used to know is not your responsibility.", "Nta. You are NTA bc you know how difficult she is, and she's a problem you don't want to pick up bc you're already aware it will end badly. You are thinking ahead and trying to protect yourself as well. There's no fault in doing so. Honestly, as much as you want to be kind and help her out, do not allow her to move in with you. By just posting here, it's already stressing you out and it'll get even worse the moment she steps foot into your door. You are not being mean or dishonest, you are being realistic as you are well aware of her personality and challenges. She does not sound necessarily like a bad person, just one who makes bad choices.There are available options if you know how to access them. Start by looking up public resources, and calling churches if you need to.There are homeless shelters, there are soup kitchens, public programs, and there are specific women's shelters as well. This is how you can help her. If she whines and harrasses you (to get you to give in) about her situation, that's on her. If she manages to get into a temporary housing situation, but gets kicked out from her behavior it's on her. You did what you could.", "My brother has done this often. The people who take him in, find anything of value gone when they wake up.  Can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been called an AH by people for not taking him in. They always callback in a day or 2 saying they should have listened and did I know how to find him now. Nope, your money and stuff are long gone. Not saying this is her, just saying you don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t respond at all. Just block her and move on. It\u2019s not like you were besties and you turned your back on her. She wants to use you. NTA", "Respond back, \"I'm so sorry you're going through a hard time. I'll keep you in my thoughts.\" Don't let her move in. It sounds like it's time for her to grow up.", "NTA\n\nOne of the hardest lessons in life is you can\u2019t help everyone, especially those who don\u2019t have the emotional maturity to fully help themselves.", "Honestly, and this is going to sound cold as hell, but I would be careful even about getting this involved.  From her description of this person, she does not sound like someone she wants to be friends with and she doesn't sound like someone who gets the hint.  If she starts getting involved in her life, she's going to have a new best friend.", "This is such a good idea.  \u2764\ufe0f"]}
