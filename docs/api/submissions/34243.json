I asked her if she went to her sister or or her mom, but apparently, her mom's boyfriend doesn't like her and her sister has told her before \"If dad ever kicks you out, you will deal with it by yourself\". While I feel for her, we are 22 and she has been working here and there since graduation. And then she showed me that she only has 2 coins left in her bank account. She has the mentality of a kid and always spent tons of money on dumb things instead of trying to fix her life. Back in high-school, we were friends for a bit because I felt sorry for her, even the class bullied her, but that was because she was seeking attention in the most childish, annoying ways possible. And to her everyone else was always guilty but not her. And she wanted me to buy her lunch because she was saving money for an iPhone. So I dropped her after a while. I didn't tell her that I don't want to be friends with her, but I started avoiding her and always told her I'm busy when she wanted to hang out. Yet, she kept begging me to go out, even when I said I don't want to so I just started to ignore her and she stopped. But yeah, she texted me yesterday. She didn't directly ask me to move in with me but I think she meant it because she told me she haven't told her mom or sis yet. If it was one of my friends I would have taken them in right away. In the end, if they really don't want her, I will take her in, I won't leave her out in the cold.  But it's just that I really don't want to.
