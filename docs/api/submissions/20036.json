She told both Maria and myself that we would be bridesmaids as well as her cousins.\n\nThis weekend, Zara invited all the bridesmaids to go dress shopping. When we got to the dress shop, she surprised us with dresses she had already picked out. However, my dress was a completely different style and colour to everyone else. The colour was a grey-green compared to everyone else\u2019s pink dress and the dress itself was several sizes too big - to the point the boutique owner said I needed a different size. \n\nWhen I asked Zara about it, she said she wanted to ensure she was the centre of attention on her wedding day and that I should be willing to wear whatever she asked to ensure this.  She also told us all that everyone would have the same makeup artist but I would need to go makeup free.\n\nI pointed out I was actually standing out amongst the bridesmaid and the dress was falling off me. However once I said this, Maria jumped in to highlight several slights against her and Zara over the years:\n\n1) Attending a party Harry invited me to when he first met Zara (according to Zara and Maria, he asked Zara who I was, complimented my appearance and was interested in me - but I never knew this)\n\n2) Dressing in a \u2018sexy\u2019 manner which caused men to approach me in restaurants and outings with the girls \n\n3) Always being the centre of attention by talking too much and smiling too much at parties and social events\n\nThey brought up occasions where I had thought I was looking out for them, for example I had informed Maria that a guy Maria flirted with followed me to the bathroom and tried to force his way in, as if I was at fault. They said that they always felt second place to me and that was largely my fault.\n\nI don\u2019t mind not wearing makeup or dressing down. I have never tried to make anyone else feel less. But if these girls can think this of me after this many years, I\u2019m not sure I should be going to the wedding at all. When I said this, Zara asked if I was dropping out of being a bridesmaid over a silly dress and I responded that it was not over the dress but I didn\u2019t want to be her bridesmaid. \n\nSince then, my whole friendship group, Maria, Harry and Zara\u2019s family have all been messaging me on social media and text about how I\u2019m ruining Zara\u2019s day and calling me horrible things.\n\nApparently Zara cried after I left and is very upset that I\u2019m not making any effort.\n\nAITA for refusing to be her bridesmaid? I think I might be because it is short notice and I should have tried to find a compromise.", "created_utc": 1687127367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cx6qc/aita_for_refusing_to_be_a_bridesmaid_for_my/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I meant JEALOUS!!!) unkind person who can't stand the fact that you're attractive and is using her wedding as an occasion to get back at you.\n\nDon't do it.  Step down from being a bridesmaid.  If Zara still wants you to attend if she can't humiliate you by making you wear the ill-fitting ugly dress, you can decide if you still want to be part of a celebration for someone who is treating you like this.\n\nThe fact that your whole friendship group is going along with this is really worrying me.  OP, you're hanging out at Mean Girl Central.  I know it's hard, but it's time to move on.  Why should you make an effort to be humiliated and made physically unattractive?

No sane and secure friend would go out of their way to put down another friend they cared about. \n\nHonestly, if you wanted to be petty (this may end your already strained friendships and you have enough good karma to do this) rejoin the wedding party. Then do (but keep quiet) the following:\n\n1. Get alterations on the grey green dress to make you stand out or just buy a dress in the same color that is a show-stopper.\n\n2. Rock the bare makeup look. Use the tinted chapstick/lip balm. \n\n3. Accessorize to make the look yours. \n\n4. Get to know the photographer shooting the wedding.
