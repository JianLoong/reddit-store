She will respect our daughter not wanting to meet her girlfriend because she made it this way.", "selftext": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xczn6q/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_will_respect_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI\u2019ll jump right into it\n\n- I talked to harleys mom, I said that 1- she needs to go to therapy with someone who doesn\u2019t choose someone\u2019s side, and someone who helps her see other POV, but I am not willing to do that with her and that\u2019s something she needs to do on her own. 2- if she continues this you ruin any chance with her, and as a mom she made a decision to protect her, not be the reason she needs protection. 3- I hope that 1 and 2 sunk in, because I\u2019m not going to be here to pick up the pieces for her shitty behavior, and now more than ever is the time to redeem herself if she even can, because we are absolutely getting a divorce. the most I can say is it was not taken well \n- I talked to Harley, I explained that we are getting a divorce, none of this is on her and it never was. But she needs the choice to not deal with this anymore, and I want her to do the little things and feel free to bring around anyone she wants and not be worried of her parents reaction.  I said this doesn\u2019t mean their relationship is over, I\u2019ll still be right here with her to try to redeem any relationship with her mom if she wants me to. I know it\u2019s a big change, but it\u2019s no one else\u2019s job but her mothers to fix her issues., I said again this wasn\u2019t her fault, but it also isn\u2019t her responsibility, and it was my fault to go on with this. She was sad at first but came to terms with this. \n- **many said to make it clear that this was not her fault and I tried my best to make sure she understood this** \n I stayed in a hotel for a while and Harley had some fun with my brother, I got a little house quick, and quickly started moving everything I could. Harley got to decorate her new room,  I got her in therapy to.\nHer mom is still swearing that Harley is going to hell, Harley needs confession, she\u2019s insulted and cursed Harley in person, then tried so act like a sweet caring mother in text and voicemail. she tried saying I\u2019m the abusive one, she\u2019s said that I was forcing her to like girls. She\u2019s said *i* was now going to hell, a shit father and husband,threatened to take Harley away permanently and much more that I don\u2019t think can be on here. I think she took this as a challenge.\n  As I said before I gave Harley the choice to stay with me or 50/50 etc. with her age, there\u2019s a good chance she get to choose, especially given the circumstances. I think she forgot what it was like to not walk on eggshells. After a week she said that she thinks she wants to stay with me, and just visit her mom with no sleepovers. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot more of her girlfriend around the house, and it\u2019s clear Harley\u2019s much more comfortable in her own skin & sexuality\nThings are still hectic, but are looking up. Overall. I\u2019ve taken most advice, We have divorced, moved out, gone to therapy, and just commonly reminding that this isn\u2019t her fault nor responsibility", "created_utc": 1669986057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zall45/update_aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_will_respect/", "score": 7809, "replies": ["You did some great dadding there.

It's not the church you grew up with, but what you did, at the very core, was very Christian. Christianity, at it's heart, is looking at those who are lesser, the poor, the needy, the outcasts, and saying \"you matter just as much as everyone else.\" Not, \"we reject this, you are sin until you repent and take on God's love\" but, \"You are worthy of God's love just by existing.\" You did that for your daughter. You rejected a lifetime's worth of bent and broken teaching and got to the heart of the message and did for your daughter what every queer person dreams of. You were her Dad first. Because the core message of every faith is love and acceptance. It's just get lost when it's in the hands of people who are afraid.  I'm so happy your daughter has you.

And honestly? I'd questioned it multiple times throughout my 20s but thought that because I didnt actively hate my body i couldnt be trans. A lot of the narrative out there is immensely helpful for trans kids who are discovering their truths but harmful to adults who are questioning but felt like because they didn't automatically  know as a child they werent trans. My mother is incredibly religious and conservative thay was how i was raised. Ive spent years unlearning all the religious trauma i went through. It has absolutely impacted me in a life long ways, and i have no doubt that one of those ways it impacted me was that i suppressed my true self for decades.

Your wife saying \"this is just a phase\" but then throwing around that she thinks your daughter is going to Hell is, in a way, pushing your daughter towards a choice (hear me out, I'm coming from a child psychologist's point of view). It's one thing to disagree with someone about things being a choice or brain chemistry, it's another thing to tell them that grey line in science (there's not as much research on the topic of teen sexuality as one would think, unfortunately, in part due to the ethics of the topic) is what's going to send them to Hell. I was raised in a very conservative environment, and most of my friends growing up have chosen \"alternate lifestyles\" to what their parents preached and are \"going to Hell\" according to their parents. In many ways, they were pushed in that direction by their own parents. You are teaching your daughter that it's okay to be human, and that you will love her and take her for what she is, no matter what.

I wish my dad would have put me first; in my case his wife was first but i was able to understand, eventually, why this \"maternal\" figure was so important for him. He lacked a lot of motherly love as a child, never spoke about it. He was always a good dad with the offspring of the current wife (his as well, we're all his) since his partner was always priority, so ..it was good while it lasted. When I became a mom i understood why and I was able to see his inner child and the man beyond the dad; it was no justification, absolutely not and he made his bed, he lied on it and all, but it was healing for ME. I was able to forgive him for everything he neglected because I realized how much he struggled in silence in a time where speaking about anything was just for little girls, i was able to understand why her partner was always more important than any of his own children (he was not abusive or mean, he just made different priorities...he wasted most of his money on his last wife and put everything on her name, but we got education so...i guess it also made it easier to forgive him, we can fish). Like I said, no justification at all but I graphically felt a weight being lifted off my shoulders when he met my baby and we hugged, it was gone, he was a loving grandpa and my child was brand new, she didn't need all that baggage. \nI'm not saying that forgiveness is a right or something someone should deserve, it's a grace but mostly is a relief. I'm sure you don't expect anything from your ex wife (wife?) and that's the best you can possibly do, your child may want to forgive her or not with time, but so far you've created a health environment with possibilities and that's the most you can do for your child, a safe space to process, to be vulnerable, to be confused and creative about it, we all need this in order to put ourselves together and go back out to fight another battle and that's such an alpha dad move that will be carried on to your descendants, great value in these acts of protection and the best inheritance you can possibly pass along.", "Wish I had had a dad like you.\n\nYou\u2019re doing amazing \u2764\ufe0f Harley is a lucky girl!", "I grew up in a religious household.
