She will respect our daughter not wanting to meet her girlfriend because she made it this way.", "selftext": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xczn6q/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_will_respect_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI\u2019ll jump right into it\n\n- I talked to harleys mom, I said that 1- she needs to go to therapy with someone who doesn\u2019t choose someone\u2019s side, and someone who helps her see other POV, but I am not willing to do that with her and that\u2019s something she needs to do on her own. 2- if she continues this you ruin any chance with her, and as a mom she made a decision to protect her, not be the reason she needs protection. 3- I hope that 1 and 2 sunk in, because I\u2019m not going to be here to pick up the pieces for her shitty behavior, and now more than ever is the time to redeem herself if she even can, because we are absolutely getting a divorce. the most I can say is it was not taken well \n- I talked to Harley, I explained that we are getting a divorce, none of this is on her and it never was. But she needs the choice to not deal with this anymore, and I want her to do the little things and feel free to bring around anyone she wants and not be worried of her parents reaction.  I said this doesn\u2019t mean their relationship is over, I\u2019ll still be right here with her to try to redeem any relationship with her mom if she wants me to. I know it\u2019s a big change, but it\u2019s no one else\u2019s job but her mothers to fix her issues., I said again this wasn\u2019t her fault, but it also isn\u2019t her responsibility, and it was my fault to go on with this. She was sad at first but came to terms with this. \n- **many said to make it clear that this was not her fault and I tried my best to make sure she understood this** \n I stayed in a hotel for a while and Harley had some fun with my brother, I got a little house quick, and quickly started moving everything I could. Harley got to decorate her new room,  I got her in therapy to.\nHer mom is still swearing that Harley is going to hell, Harley needs confession, she\u2019s insulted and cursed Harley in person, then tried so act like a sweet caring mother in text and voicemail. she tried saying I\u2019m the abusive one, she\u2019s said that I was forcing her to like girls. She\u2019s said *i* was now going to hell, a shit father and husband,threatened to take Harley away permanently and much more that I don\u2019t think can be on here. I think she took this as a challenge.\n  As I said before I gave Harley the choice to stay with me or 50/50 etc. with her age, there\u2019s a good chance she get to choose, especially given the circumstances. I think she forgot what it was like to not walk on eggshells. After a week she said that she thinks she wants to stay with me, and just visit her mom with no sleepovers. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot more of her girlfriend around the house, and it\u2019s clear Harley\u2019s much more comfortable in her own skin & sexuality\nThings are still hectic, but are looking up. Overall. I\u2019ve taken most advice, We have divorced, moved out, gone to therapy, and just commonly reminding that this isn\u2019t her fault nor responsibility", "created_utc": 1669986057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zall45/update_aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_will_respect/", "score": 2832, "replies": ["You did some great dadding there.

It's not the church you grew up with, but what you did, at the very core, was very Christian. Christianity, at it's heart, is looking at those who are lesser, the poor, the needy, the outcasts, and saying \"you matter just as much as everyone else.\" Not, \"we reject this, you are sin until you repent and take on God's love\" but, \"You are worthy of God's love just by existing.\" You did that for your daughter. You rejected a lifetime's worth of bent and broken teaching and got to the heart of the message and did for your daughter what every queer person dreams of. You were her Dad first. Because the core message of every faith is love and acceptance. It's just get lost when it's in the hands of people who are afraid.  I'm so happy your daughter has you.

And I wanted to let you know the reason her mom acts nice in voicemails and texts is that it's documented. So I would have Harley turn on a voice recorder on her phone whenever she's around her mom. I might even tell her to show her mom that she's done it and that you and she agree that it will be done whenever she's around her mom, whether or not she's told about it first.\n\nNow as I say this, I want to mention a couple things, find out if you are in a 1 party consent state. And make sure your ex is not allowed through the custody agreement to take Harley's phone away whether or not you are in a 1 party consent state. Maybe even see if you can get it in the custody arrangement that because the abuse is verbal and emotional that recording by the minor, and custodial parent on behalf of the minor, are allowed while she's visiting the mother, if possible.\n\nYour ex doesn't want it documented that she's abusing her daughter, doesn't want witnesses, or it being able to be shown.

I'd been wondering for over a year and then read \"the gender euphoria bible\" and was like oh well shit then.  The biggest thing that helped me was having actual trans people tell me that if youre questioning your gender that intently and for that long i was probably trans because cis people simply do not have those mental conversations for that long. And honestly? I'd questioned it multiple times throughout my 20s but thought that because I didnt actively hate my body i couldnt be trans. A lot of the narrative out there is immensely helpful for trans kids who are discovering their truths but harmful to adults who are questioning but felt like because they didn't automatically  know as a child they werent trans. My mother is incredibly religious and conservative thay was how i was raised. Ive spent years unlearning all the religious trauma i went through. It has absolutely impacted me in a life long ways, and i have no doubt that one of those ways it impacted me was that i suppressed my true self for decades. My mother absolutely was homophobic hate the sin type. She was all for trans bathroom bills. She mellowed as i aged, however. When I came out I worried I was going to get a reaction like your wife, and instead got a reaction more like you, OP. \n\nYou're a great dad.", "Glad you are treating your daughter like the human being that she is.", "Wow, I wish I had parents like you growing up.

Also make sure that Harley knows she is old enough to tell the courts what she wants (if it comes down to it) \n\nAny and all communication should be through messages and email so there is always a paper trail and proof of what's said and who's being argumentative/unwilling to coparent peacefully.

My parents were never like your ex-wife in their response to me coming out, but it wasn't exactly a warm welcome when I came out. It took time, but they eventually came to my wedding, but the ripple effects of the discomfort of those early years still persist and are still a topic of conversation with my therapist. It's such a pivotal time in the coming out process and it's so incredibly terrifying to reveal your true self to the people who are supposed to love you the most, only to be met with some form of rejection. I understand religious beliefs are hard to undo. It took years and new experiences for my parents to finally warm up and come around. It took distance and less contact for years on my part.\n\nReading your two posts warmed my heart. While so many queer kids still have horrible experiences with their parents, it always brings me so much joy to see stories like this. It's your ex-wife who is losing out in all of this. I understand the comfort of holding onto religious beliefs, the comfort of that space, but it also causes so much pain.
