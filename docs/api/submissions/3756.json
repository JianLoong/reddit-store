She will respect our daughter not wanting to meet her girlfriend because she made it this way.", "selftext": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xczn6q/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_will_respect_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI\u2019ll jump right into it\n\n- I talked to harleys mom, I said that 1- she needs to go to therapy with someone who doesn\u2019t choose someone\u2019s side, and someone who helps her see other POV, but I am not willing to do that with her and that\u2019s something she needs to do on her own. 2- if she continues this you ruin any chance with her, and as a mom she made a decision to protect her, not be the reason she needs protection. 3- I hope that 1 and 2 sunk in, because I\u2019m not going to be here to pick up the pieces for her shitty behavior, and now more than ever is the time to redeem herself if she even can, because we are absolutely getting a divorce. the most I can say is it was not taken well \n- I talked to Harley, I explained that we are getting a divorce, none of this is on her and it never was. But she needs the choice to not deal with this anymore, and I want her to do the little things and feel free to bring around anyone she wants and not be worried of her parents reaction.  I said this doesn\u2019t mean their relationship is over, I\u2019ll still be right here with her to try to redeem any relationship with her mom if she wants me to. I know it\u2019s a big change, but it\u2019s no one else\u2019s job but her mothers to fix her issues., I said again this wasn\u2019t her fault, but it also isn\u2019t her responsibility, and it was my fault to go on with this. She was sad at first but came to terms with this. \n- **many said to make it clear that this was not her fault and I tried my best to make sure she understood this** \n I stayed in a hotel for a while and Harley had some fun with my brother, I got a little house quick, and quickly started moving everything I could. Harley got to decorate her new room,  I got her in therapy to.\nHer mom is still swearing that Harley is going to hell, Harley needs confession, she\u2019s insulted and cursed Harley in person, then tried so act like a sweet caring mother in text and voicemail. she tried saying I\u2019m the abusive one, she\u2019s said that I was forcing her to like girls. She\u2019s said *i* was now going to hell, a shit father and husband,threatened to take Harley away permanently and much more that I don\u2019t think can be on here. I think she took this as a challenge.\n  As I said before I gave Harley the choice to stay with me or 50/50 etc. with her age, there\u2019s a good chance she get to choose, especially given the circumstances. I think she forgot what it was like to not walk on eggshells. After a week she said that she thinks she wants to stay with me, and just visit her mom with no sleepovers. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot more of her girlfriend around the house, and it\u2019s clear Harley\u2019s much more comfortable in her own skin & sexuality\nThings are still hectic, but are looking up. Overall. I\u2019ve taken most advice, We have divorced, moved out, gone to therapy, and just commonly reminding that this isn\u2019t her fault nor responsibility", "created_utc": 1669986057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zall45/update_aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_will_respect/", "score": 284, "replies": ["You did some great dadding there. Wish you and your daughter  well.", "I remember reading your original and thinking \"this will end in divorce\". I'm sorry I was right. \n\nYou are doing the right thing to protect your daughter. I'm so sorry her mother's behaviour is so vile.\n\nBest of luck, I hope you find someone you can find love with again.", "You are an amazing Dad. Well done for working so hard to support Harley emotionally", "Thank you for being a loving father and a good role model. \n\nAnd I'm sorry, but your wife is bonkers, and you need to tell her that if she's insisting on keeping up this way, you'll not only expose her to the church,  but also seek a restraining order for you and your daughter, and you'll go after her for every penny you can get.", "Kudos. Sorry to hear about the drama.", "Good for you for prioritizing your child and not allowing anyone, especially your wife/her mother, to cause her harm.", "i am so delighted to hear that y'all are splitting. and you're such a good dad OP! good on your for protecting/prioritizing your daughter and getting her out of that mess. harley sounds like a good kid and i wish y'all nothing but happiness.", "And that\u2019s how you be a good parent", "You're doing a great job, OP. Thank you for being there to support your daughter as she continues on her journey of self-discovery. Her life will be better because you were there for her.", "I wish we had more dads like you in the world. Your daughter is lucky to habe you in her corner.  Good job!", "You are an example for many mothers & fathers.\n\nI wish you and your daughter the best \ud83d\ude0a", "I am so sorry you have to go through something painful, but the silver lining is that your priorities are so beautifully in order. Great job there, dad: your daughter not only gets to freely be herself, but she knows that you value her well-being above all else. That's going to be her framework for how others treat her in all of her relationships. You're an excellent parent and I hope things keep going well for you both.", "Thank you for having your kid's back and removing her from a toxic situation. Her mom might come around, but it doesn't sound like it. \n\nMost importantly, Harley has the undeniable knowledge that you love her so much that you moved heaven and earth, so to speak, to protect her. That's some grade A+ parenting right there. You can't underestimate how good this is for her and her confidence in herself.", "well done - sad that your marriage had to end but wonderful Harley has your support.  The more I see of religions causing hatred, persecution and wars the more it reinforces me being agnostic.", "Congrats on your new life without all of the religious BS mucking it up!", "What a great parent you are. It takes a lot of courage to upend your whole life like this but your daughter will appreciate the message you have given her and the truly unconditional and unbreakable love and support you have shown her \u2764\ufe0f", "Catholicism: Not Even Once.", "Dad of the year \ud83c\udf89", "Thank you for supporting your daughter. You did the right thing. I wish more parents could be as awesome with this as you and realize that even if they are Christian, they're not doing themselves any favors because the bible says two major things. First being love one another. Second being let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Great job modeling that behavior.", "As a daughter of a man who stood by and watched his wife abuse me, once even calling and begging her to come home after she got arrested for assaulting me when I was in HS, thank you for protecting your daughter. Thank you for putting her safety first. Wishing you both well while you heal.", "You got a divorce and a house in two months? Idk", "Rock on Dad! Thanks for having your daughter's back.

Great job OP.", "You are a good person.  I'm happy you and your daughter are safe.", "Telling your daughter none of this was her fault or responsibility honestly made me tear up. You\u2019re a fantastic dad. I wish now were like you.", "Sounds like you made the best decision for both your daughter and yourself.\n\nOne piece of advice, though:  document.  Keep good notes on your wife's abusive behavior, save texts and messages, make sure you have a solid record.   You would hope that at your daughter's age the courts would allow her to choose where she lives, but if they don't, that documentation could be critical to ensuring your future ex does not get custody of your daughter, which obviously would be the worst possible outcome.", "World class parenting right there.\n\nThanks, Dad, you're the BEST!", "Dad level 100+", "This is amazing OP", "I feel like your ex is like many other zealous Christians and is actually suppressing her own sexuality. I feel like in the end she might admit she also likes girls and was punishing your daughter instead of herself. You are a great dad, keep doing what you're doing!", "Top notch fathering here.  A++.  People this religious are borderline mentally ill and it's sad to see because it's likely from years of brainwashing.  Proud of you for getting out of there situation.", "I'm sorry about your marriage, but I'm so happy you're supporting your daughter and her girlfriend.", "can we all just remember that he\u2019s religious too and still doesn\u2019t act like this? Just thought maybe no matter what his religious beliefs, he should love his daughter? crazy shi", "Thank you\ud83d\ude4f you too", "you and many others lmfao. Thank you\ud83d\ude4f", "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f", "That church would cheer her on. Stopped going to that shit a while back, people there are awful.", "Never said everything was finalized, there\u2019s a long court battle ahead waiting for me, as for the house, you can get a house as soon a few weeks or one month, so yeah I had to move quick, did you expect me to stay in a hotel for the next few months? Can\u2019t stay with my brother, my crazy family is cut off, i can\u2019t go into my ex\u2019s house, some people may or may not need to come to the house throughout this, I have to show stability. My daughter needs a home and her own room, What else did you expect me to do?", "I wish all kids had a dad like you.\n\nYou put your daughter first and stand by her, she knows you will always be their for her and respect her decisions.\n\nYou are awesome, putting your child first and not forcing your beliefs on to her.\n\nI'm glad your daughter trusts you to be open and have a loving relationship with her.\n\nKeep doing the great work dad.\n\nAgain you are awesome.\n\nWish I had an award for you, I don't so here's a poor woman's \ud83c\udfc5\n\nNTA sorry to say this but your ex is a homophobic AHOLE", "I'm sorry about that.  Please do try to get an RO at least, and me and my kittens (who also are bonkers, but in a good way) will hope for you and your daughters best. Also, the girlfriend seems like a nice person. :)", "Fair enough. Escrow has been at least 90 days every time I\u2019ve bought real estate. Sorry. The way it read, it sounded like you were saying you finalized a divorce where custody was at issue, and as a devoted dad going into year 7 of a custody dispute, it seemed impossible. Good luck regardless.", "All good thank you"]}
