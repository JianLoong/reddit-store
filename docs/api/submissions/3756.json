She will respect our daughter not wanting to meet her girlfriend because she made it this way.", "selftext": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xczn6q/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_will_respect_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI\u2019ll jump right into it\n\n- I talked to harleys mom, I said that 1- she needs to go to therapy with someone who doesn\u2019t choose someone\u2019s side, and someone who helps her see other POV, but I am not willing to do that with her and that\u2019s something she needs to do on her own. 2- if she continues this you ruin any chance with her, and as a mom she made a decision to protect her, not be the reason she needs protection. 3- I hope that 1 and 2 sunk in, because I\u2019m not going to be here to pick up the pieces for her shitty behavior, and now more than ever is the time to redeem herself if she even can, because we are absolutely getting a divorce. the most I can say is it was not taken well \n- I talked to Harley, I explained that we are getting a divorce, none of this is on her and it never was. But she needs the choice to not deal with this anymore, and I want her to do the little things and feel free to bring around anyone she wants and not be worried of her parents reaction.  I said this doesn\u2019t mean their relationship is over, I\u2019ll still be right here with her to try to redeem any relationship with her mom if she wants me to. I know it\u2019s a big change, but it\u2019s no one else\u2019s job but her mothers to fix her issues., I said again this wasn\u2019t her fault, but it also isn\u2019t her responsibility, and it was my fault to go on with this. She was sad at first but came to terms with this. \n- **many said to make it clear that this was not her fault and I tried my best to make sure she understood this** \n I stayed in a hotel for a while and Harley had some fun with my brother, I got a little house quick, and quickly started moving everything I could. Harley got to decorate her new room,  I got her in therapy to.\nHer mom is still swearing that Harley is going to hell, Harley needs confession, she\u2019s insulted and cursed Harley in person, then tried so act like a sweet caring mother in text and voicemail. she tried saying I\u2019m the abusive one, she\u2019s said that I was forcing her to like girls. She\u2019s said *i* was now going to hell, a shit father and husband,threatened to take Harley away permanently and much more that I don\u2019t think can be on here. I think she took this as a challenge.\n  As I said before I gave Harley the choice to stay with me or 50/50 etc. with her age, there\u2019s a good chance she get to choose, especially given the circumstances. I think she forgot what it was like to not walk on eggshells. After a week she said that she thinks she wants to stay with me, and just visit her mom with no sleepovers. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot more of her girlfriend around the house, and it\u2019s clear Harley\u2019s much more comfortable in her own skin & sexuality\nThings are still hectic, but are looking up. Overall. I\u2019ve taken most advice, We have divorced, moved out, gone to therapy, and just commonly reminding that this isn\u2019t her fault nor responsibility", "created_utc": 1669986057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zall45/update_aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_will_respect/", "score": 1380, "replies": ["You did some great dadding there.

Keep good notes on your wife's abusive behavior, save texts and messages, make sure you have a solid record.

How heartbreaking that there are parents that choose this.", "So I'm gonna say something a little weird, bear with me. It's not the church you grew up with, but what you did, at the very core, was very Christian. Christianity, at it's heart, is looking at those who are lesser, the poor, the needy, the outcasts, and saying \"you matter just as much as everyone else.\" Not, \"we reject this, you are sin until you repent and take on God's love\" but, \"You are worthy of God's love just by existing.\" You did that for your daughter. You rejected a lifetime's worth of bent and broken teaching and got to the heart of the message and did for your daughter what every queer person dreams of. You were her Dad first. Because the core message of every faith is love and acceptance. It's just get lost when it's in the hands of people who are afraid.  I'm so happy your daughter has you. You are a good Dad and you are doing right by her. Keep doing what you are doing. <3", "I grew up in on a farm in Central Texas, am a born again Southern Baptist, I served my country in the United States Army along with four out of seven children.

I'm lucky enough to have a wife that is open-minded and a true partner in raising our daughter together, but I know very well that when it comes to priorities in my life, my daughter is first and I'll be willing to go down the same path you went to protect her.", "Great job Dad!!

I'm so glad you chose this path, for you and Harley \u2764\ufe0f also, depending on where you live encourage Harley to get involved in the queer community! I find it helps a lot to get involved with others who are similar, and she can probably find a lot of people who relate to and can support her in naviagting her relationship with her mother.
