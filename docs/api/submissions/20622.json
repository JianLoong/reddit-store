And I'd betcha she's not really pregnant, she's just pulling out all the stops to get her way.", "NTA - Sometimes I wonder if the stories I read on here are true or not.  It's crazy to me that an adult would throw a fit about who has the bigger room, especially since it was just for one night.  Even if there were no pregnancies involved.  I hope her boyfriend saw the red flags.", "NTA I didn't need special accommodations at 4 weeks pregnant. I am clumsy now that I'm further in. Plus things hurt.", "NTA, trying to grab the big room for a single night when your wife is already asleep makes her the asshole even if she was 9 months pregnant.", "NTA\n\nyou snooze you lose your sister can cry about it", "NtA. Your sister joined last minute. Push back . She moved out years ago. No longer hers but your parents . Petty", "Is your sister a bit \u201chard of thinking\u201d or just selfish? NTA", "Never even considered it bc happy spouse = happy house. But at the same time the sister kept harping about \"just one night, it's not like your wife is THAT clumsy and will trip in a single night.\" The wife is in fact that clumsy.", "Bet she's not actually pregnant", "Even if your wife was an Olympic medalist on the balance beam and not pregnant, you did the right thing.", "Pending dramatic miscarriage!", "Wow.... Magical pregnancy. If only it were so easy. One day you are not pregnant, then you dream , wake up next morning and voila!!!!! NTA in case it wasn't clear", "NTA.  Your sister is though.", "NTA. Good grief, your sister is S tier entitled.", "NTA\n\nYou were there first, it would be rude to move you (doubly so when you were actually asleep at the time of the request).\n\nWhile she may be pregnant, you also are, and are much further along, so you will take presidence.\n\nShe mostly just sounds like a teenager going in a huff because they didn't get the bedroom they wanted...", "NTA. IF your sister is really pregnant, she certainly isn\u2019t pregnant enough to need more space or a bigger bed. I get she has a sentimental attachment to her bedroom, but it\u2019s just one night, and she will get over it. It is completely unreasonable to expect you to wake up your sleeping, pregnant wife and evict her from the room. Especially since the other room is a tripping hazard.", "Of course sister isn't pregnant because no way in hell this entitled, narcissistic woman wouldn't have announced it the moment she got to know so that all the attention, lights and claps will be on her and not OP's wife.", "Heck, she had apparently tested that morning and tried to say \"I can't even announce it because your wife is pregnant and would steal her thunder so give me the room\"\n\nLike, you just announced it (even if i don't believe her) and are trying to get the room via \"woe is me\"\n\nIt's so strange honestly", "\n>The wife is in fact that clumsy.\n\n>Posting for my hubby but,\n\nMade me smile. You guys must be a great couple, this can only be done with a sense of humor\n\nOh, and NTA. Sister is delusional to think anyone believes her.", "NTA\n\nFirst month is NOT the same as fourth or fifth. And you planned first.", "NTA. You're wife is further along than sister, if in fact, sister is pregnant at all. It's not a matter of favoring one pregnant lady over another. It's a matter of who can safely navigate the room better, the one who can still see her feet vs the one who can't. And it's one night. Your sister can suck it up.", "Yeah, this vibe.....you know how sometimes youre a few weeks late for your period? If I announced I was pregnant every time I was a month (or two) late..... I'd have like 70 kids by now.....", "No one said she couldn't announce it. It wasn't like our visit was to announce our pregnancy either, it was just a yearly visit we do since we live on the other side of the world essentially. Wife is very shy so even our wedding was tiny since she hates being at the center of attention.", "Well she is still only 20. I had mentioned we could stay at a hotel if she wanted to stay the rest of the week in the big room but hubby said \"hell no, she's an adult and needs to deal with that room no longer being hers and hasn't been for a while.\"", "The beds are the same size and type in both rooms, just the smaller room only has walking space on one side and our luggage would have covered att the walking space hence the bigger room.", "My sister did that once. Burned all her bridges.", "So she\u2019s just a drama Queen.", "NTA. Your sister is nuts.", "In general (not an absolute rule) you test about 21 days after your first missed period.  \n\n\nSo it seems very odd that she claims to be less than a month pregnant. Because statistically, 1 in 4 women will miscarry in the first two months, which is why most women don't make the big announcement until the third month, when the risk drops significantly.  \n\n\nSo I'm pretty darn sure Sis is not pregnant at all.", "NTA. Please don't feel guilty about keeping the big room for your currently very pregnant wife. You were a superstar of a husband to handle this withoutwaking your wife.\n\nI 56, now have 2 adult children. I can tell you with certainty that being 1 month pregnant is negligible in the physical effects on the mother than being 20-30 weeks pregnant. Most women don't even know they're pregnant until 3 months or so.\n\nYour sister is acting entitled and dredging up any possible reason so that your family will agree with her. Is your sister like this on other issues?", "NTA", "It's the husband's parents, and they left it up to my husband bc usually they spoil the hell out of his sister. She recently started making more and more demands so they have backed off of the spoiling.", "Selfish. I have seen her throw a shit fit for not getting spending money from her parents despite having thousands in her bank account.", "That\u2019s not typical in my experience\u2014where I live (US) the available tests work reliably within about fourteen days after conception, which is generally within a day or two of a missed period. And it\u2019s not uncommon for people to tell close family right away.", "Her words were 3 weeks along", "Yes"]}
