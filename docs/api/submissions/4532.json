She\u2019d make herself food and keep her own room clean but she refused to clean up after anybody (not even me) but herself when we lived with other people. \n\nSo when we moved to this apartment I told her she could have the masters if she cooked and cleaned and she agreed.

Give her some specific chores to be responsible for, but not everything.  Find another solution - she\u2019s a young teen, not an adult partner.", "Why won't they hire a maid or a housekeeper? These types of people love to take advantage of their children's 'help' in the name of responsibility. A thirteen year old cleaning her room and cooking for herself is enough. She should be concentrating on her studies without getting harassed into being a maid.", "You're an idiot. This is an \"I made an adult decision to have a child with someone, and I shouldn't expect my accidental creation to take care of me\" situation. In the animal kingdom, animals don't have kids to take care of them, they have kids to extend the existence of their species. Humans do the same, except some of those parents don't have the proper instinct to raise those kids until they are capable to take care of themselves. And some decide to have kids to make sure they're taken care of when the get old and incapable. \n\nSorry \"western civilization\" focuses more on raising their kids to take care of themselves, rather than raising them to take care of their own obsolete and aging asses.", "No worries! Just switch rooms and then she can do what she wants. That is the lesson that needs to be learned. Not cleaning the house!", "When I was 13 my chores around the house were feeding the chickens, mowing the grass, pulling the weeds beside the house because back then we didn't have weed eaters, splitting firewood, and stacking said firewood. In Return for that I got a place to live, food to eat, clothes to wear, and the lesson in how to be a man from my dad. I'm thankful everyday that he taught me to work hard, taught me the value of hard work, and taught me how to do it without bitching. If she can cook for herself but refuses to cook for anyone else, that's not a labor issue, it's selfishness. If she refuses to help clean up the house, not paint it, not do woodworking or plumbing, but clean, then that's not labor issue just laziness. This is a selfish and spoiled child who needs to learn the value of work, and keeping her word.", "This is exactly the feeling I got from his post. It's disgusting. He's treating her like a live-in girlfriend, not his barely teenaged daughter. All for the privilege of a \"master bedroom\" which honestly, if she never leaves that house she deserves all the space she can get. And then he pretends he's being a good parent and teaching her a lesson by not letting her switch rooms to get out of being his slave.", "No she\u2019s not a maid nor do I want to make her one she is homeschooled because I don\u2019t think schools are safe (school shootings) and she also isn\u2019t very good with making friends so I\u2019m scared she might be bullied", "This is my question!!", "Child bride! Ding ding ding", "Good question! Poor girl seems very isolated and alone.", "By then he will have had her so isolated, uneducated and dependant on him that her only option is to continue living with him. And as much as he is isolating her and keeping her uneducated..because that is not home schooling....he is grooming her to be his wife.\n\nEdit you are criminally yta", "And what does he mean by \u2018she does nothing all day\u2019 ?", "So you actually equate a privileged, spoiled child having to do a little cleaning and cooking in order to keep her side of a deal she made with her father to actual slavery? To people being forced to work 20 hours a day, under threat of being whipped, beaten, maimed, and mutilated? To having no possessions that they can legally call their own, to living in hovels, eating substandard food, and having no personal freedoms? That is what you're comparing this young ladies situation too? You need to take a long hard look at your values if that's what you're suggesting.", "We must have read two different posts. I see nothing about him asking her to do it all. I see him holding her to the deal she made. A deal she made in order to get something that she wanted. And besides, having been a stay-at-home dad at various points throughout my life, I can tell you that it's not really as hard to cook and clean as people would have you believe. One good cleaning on monday, and the house stays pretty well tidy if you keep it picked up the rest of the week. Two, maybe three meals a day is not that difficult, or time consuming. It only becomes a problem in sitcoms, when they milk it for laughs.", "We must have read two different posts. I seen nothing in there about doing everything. I do see where he made a deal with her to give her the large bedroom if she cooked and cleaned. And she has went back up on that deal. The best thing he could do at this point is to switch back, still make her do all the chores, teach her how to be responsible, and show her that there are consequences for going back on your word. You sound like you survived it well enough, with no long-term ill effects. My guess is you can understand the need for a child to have some responsibilities. When he starts asking her to rebuild car engines, lay block foundations for an addition to the house, and go out and cut a hay field with a hand sickle, then I'll agree he's went a bit too far.", "Read the end of the post. OP won\u2019t allow her to switch rooms. Dude\u2019s a complete AH.", "You do realise that the chores you listed doing at her age are a lot less than what she has to do, right?", "> she also isn\u2019t very good with making friends\n\nGee, I wonder why /s", "So\u2026 instead of being a parent. You make her stay at home and socially isolate her. This depriving her of learning the skills to make friends and deal with bullies? \n\nAnd then you say \u201cshe does nothing all day\u201d? When she\u2019s doing school work? \n How is she going to survive on her own when she\u2019s an adult OP?  Or are you hoping she stays with you forever cleaning and cooking? \n\nYou are a bad parent.", "She isn\u2019t good at making friends because you have completely isolated her.", "Isolating your kid for your own unhinged and illogical anxiety coupled with everything else is giving me abusive mom vibes", "If she isn't good at making friends, homeschooling is gonna make it waaaaaaay worse.\n\nYour poor child.", "YTA. So you socially isolate her and take the role of caretaker to you when you are her parent. This is very close to abuse. I had parents like you and now I have very low contact with them. Get ready for your future.", "You don't let her go to school because you're scared she might be bullied?\n\nThis is such a terrible message to send her", "You should take care of your fucking house and let her live her life.\nI hope she is able to move out as soon as she can because if not she will have no live and will be FORCED to be your maid.\nGROW THE FUCK UP AND LET HER LIVE HER LIFE, BASTARD!", "You are a terrible terrible parent.\n\nIt is your job to ensure that she is getting a good education. And letting a kid learn by herself online is not the way.\n\nAlso it's your responsibility to provide a clean house and food to her. She is not responsible for cooking and cleaning after you. You should be thankful that she cleans her room and fixes herself food. \n\nDo better", "That stood out to me too. Like, a thirteen year old should be in school at least half of the day. I think it\u2019s ok to expect her to clean her own room and bathroom and maybe vacuuming shared spaces once a week but everything else is on OP as the parent. The daughter even cooks for herself and cleans up afterwards so why is OP even complaining?", "Sorry, it's not a little cleaning and cooking\n\nIt's being forced to take care of the entire household because her parent is neglectful \n\nShe is being forced to act as a caretaker in return for room and board, in a scenario where she can't leave (in civilised society that is slavery if not just straight up abuse) \n\nHate to break it to you, but keeping a child from receiving an education so they are your servant isn't normal", "\"People out there have it worse so no one is ever allowed to complain\" bullshit. Abusive behavior is abusive behavior no matter if it's small or excessive. Stop excusing OP for being a shit parent.", "If he's asking her to even clean his bedroom and bathroom then what exactly is he doing so she's not doing it all?", "Mate, he\u2019s asking her to clean his bedroom and personal bathroom, and basically do everything. Shes 13 and his daughter.", "If it\u2019s not that hard than OP (the actual parent, who chose to have a child) can do it.", "He literally said in the post he expects her to do all of the housework and cooking including cleaning his own room and bath room.", "Are you daft?", ">We must have read two different posts\n\nI'm not sure you actually read anything, tbh.", "\"You sound like you survived it well enough, with no long-term ill effects\"\n\nBro, you ever heard of therapy?\n\nAlso, just because you learn to cope with long-term effects doesn't mean they don't exist.\n\nThis is at best neglectful, at worst emotional incest.\n\nStop using your eldest daughters as a substitute parent/partner????\n\nWhen he starts cleaning up after himself, then I'll agree she's going to far.", "True. This situation sounds horrifying, the poor kid. Kids who are actually home-schooled usually have a parent teaching them and helping them with work, often there are siblings around, and home-schooling parents organize groups that get together and go on field trips, etc, so their kids can socialize with each other. The situation OP is describing sounds crushingly isolating and lonely to the point of abuse.", "Except, he is the dad.", "Yes, yes they are. I've been reading their replies, and I think there are some major issues in their life."]}
