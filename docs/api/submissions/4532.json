She\u2019d make herself food and keep her own room clean but she refused to clean up after anybody (not even me) but herself when we lived with other people. \n\nSo when we moved to this apartment I told her she could have the masters if she cooked and cleaned and she agreed.

When I was 12 I took care of the entire household. To make everything worse - I lived with my older brother, older step sister, step father and my mother. Aperently, non of them had the time for chores. If I didnt do just one thing from to do list, I would get grounded. So every day I would come home from school. I would start cooking. While the is getting cooked, I would vacum the entire house. Do the dishes (we didnt had a dishwasher), deal with laundary, etc.\n\nOnly \"free\" time i had in one day was after the dinner, then I could chose betwen studying and relaxing. Ofcourse, they've expected from me to be straight A's student, if I had any B, I would still be grounded.\n\nI got so used to it, that most of my childhood I didnt even think about it. \n\nWhen I got in to college, it got worse. I was still living with my family, they still expected from me to take care of everything. But they also expected from me to get a job and be a great student. Eversince I was a kid, my mom would monitor my entire day. She knew how long it took me do all of my stuff and if I had an hour a day just for relaxing, she would lose her mind calling me lazy and useless. Imagine how scared and anxious I was. I knew that my brother didnt had to do half of the stuff that i had, but whenever I tried to speak, no one would care. Not to mention my mother, who would come from work and spend hours just resting. She had free weekends, so she could do whatever she wanted. While I had only 3 hours a week to spend with my friends.\n\nOne of the weirdest things that has happen, was when one day I cooked the lunch, but I didnt do the dishes, since I had to go to a class. My brother was home the entire day and he didnt eat, because the dishes were dirty. I was yell at. So, mentaly, I was in a terrible place. \n\nOver the years, my grades were going down, I couldnt finnish all the classes. And my anxiety was trough the roof. I couldnt sleep, I couldnt relax even for a minute. I was just expecting to hear how terrible I am. It wasnt until I was 26 when I finally realized that I was abused.\nThere were no information on mental abuse when I was a child. There was no one who could stop my family. There was one one to tell me to leave them.\n\nNow Im 28. Still in college. Still doing low paid jobs and still dealing with anxiety. I'm trying to overcome all of the abuse and build myself a better life. When it comes to my family, we are still living together, only because Im not ready to leave them for good. I have agoraphobia and Im not earning enough to live on my own, plus Im paying therapy, cause I realy need it. But things are a little different now. I've set some boundaries and most of the time, im not hurt when they try to lecture me, now I just defend myself. And that is my ultimate goal. Not to runaway and hide myself, but to walkaway fully secure in myself.\n\nIm sorry for my bad english, its not my first language.\nThe point Im trying to make is that you can ruin your daughters life by expecting from her to act as an adult, while she is a child. And eventrough it looks like she is doing nothing all day, it only looks like that to you. Cause, she is still going to school, doing homework and she deserves couple of hours to herself. You are working, but you want couple of hours to yourself when you get home. Its not fair to her. \n\nOnly advice that I can offer you, that could help you with your life is to plan your meals better. Cook more on your day offs, freeze all of the extra meals that you've made. I will not taste good as fresh, but you will have more time for yourself. Cause house chores are not worth the fight. Instead try to be more grateful for having such a good daughter.

I don't care if you are tired by the end of the day, YOU ARE THE PARENT SO ACT LIKE IT!!!! YTA!", "She's 13. A child. Your daughter. Not spouse. \n\nYTA", "I am very confused. Is she your parent or are you hers ?", "She's a child! Your \"deal\" was inappropriate to make with a 13 year old.\n\nShe isn't your servant.", "I was going to ask if we had enough information that somebody could call CPS.", "He\u2019s says online schooling.", "He said he\u2019s afraid of school shooting", "That\u2019s my question. Has OP answered it anywhere yet?", "you had to do wayyy less chores than she has to. she has to do all the cleaning and cooking, including OP's bedroom and bathroom. she is not his slave.", "Sonsband (this iirc is an actual nickname for forced incestuous relationship where mothers forces their sons to be replacement husband) meet wifeter or daughfe. Whichever it is, it's absolutely very very wrong.", "But he's apparently not afraid of his daughter being 30, dependent on him and have to do house chores like the forced incest wife that she's forced to be.\n\nI'm honestly impressed this 13 year old is very independent and stands up for herself. Knows how to play her father so she gets the benefits too. However, seeing the shitty father's neglect. No wonder she had to grow up on her own.", "Even though US is \"famous\" for it, Americans get shot at churches, concerts, streets etc, so unless he wants to totally isolate her, so she would think it is normal for a child to take care of her parent, his reasoning is weird. But wait...", "Wow what kind of parent are you?\n\nChildren need to be exposed to other kids, that's how they learn valuable social skills like how to make friends, socialize, deal with bullies/confrontation. If she is having trouble with that it's because you have forced her into isolation instead of dealing with the issues like a proper parent.\n\nYou are setting up your daughter for failure.", "This child needs to be removed away from you asap", "Yeah that happens when you socially isolate and neglect a child, they struggle with socialising.", "Of course you don\u2019t want her to be a maid, that would mean you\u2019d have to pay her. She more like a slave who has to cook and clean for you.", "This gives me cult leader vibes for some reason", "I understand the fear however the point in homeschooling is that you are meant to homeschool her"]}
