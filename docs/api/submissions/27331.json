{"id": 27331, "submission_id": "16olxc2", "title": "AITA for not backing down on my daughter\u2019s teachers calling her the proper name?", "selftext": "My daughter, Alexandra (14F), hates any shortened version of her name. This has gone on since she was about 10. The family respects it and she\u2019s pretty good about advocating for herself should someone call her Lexi, Alex, etc. She also hates when people get her name wrong and just wants to be called Alexandra.\n\nShe took Spanish in middle school. The teacher wanted to call all students by the Spanish version of their name (provided there was one). So, she tried to call Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her and the teacher respected it. She had the same teacher all 3 years of middle school, so it wasn\u2019t an issue. \n\nNow, she\u2019s in high school and is still taking Spanish. Once again, the new teacher announced if a student had a Spanish version of their name, she\u2019d call them that. So, she called Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her but the teacher ignored her. My daughter came home upset after the second week. I am not the type of mom to write emails, but I felt I had to in this case.\n\nIf matters, this teacher is not Hispanic herself, so this isn\u2019t a pronunciation issue. Her argument is if these kids ever went to a Spanish speaking country, they\u2019d be called by that name. I found this excuse a little weak as the middle school Spanish teacher actually was Hispanic who had come here from a Spanish speaking country and she respected Alexandra\u2019s wishes.\n\nThe teacher tried to dig her heels in, but I said if it wasn\u2019t that big a deal in her eyes that she calls her Alejandra, why is it such a big deal to just call her Alexandra? Eventually, she gave in. Alexandra confirmed that her teacher is calling her by her proper name. \n\nMy husband feels I blew this out of proportion and Alexandra could\u2019ve sucked it up for a year (the school has 3 different Spanish teachers, so odds are she could get another one her sophomore year). \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695317663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16olxc2/aita_for_not_backing_down_on_my_daughters/", "score": 1455, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I kind of like it! But at the same time, if this girl wants to only be called Alexandra and not any other variation, then the teacher should respect that. So I guess consider me neutral on this one.", "I support people being called what they want to be called.\n\nBut I do not believe this is an issue with identity, or respect.\n\nI would advocate being resilient and accepting that things aren't always going to go their way.

It's pretty common in language classes to pick equivalent names for students as a fun means of immersion.

Your kid needs to learn that they have a right to enforce what theyre called, who they are etc. I think you did the right thing by allowing her that, sometimes we forget that smaller issues like this are teaching them where they fit in the world.

Same as if someone uses different pronouns, or like doesn't want to use their ethnic name or deadname.  I'm sure the teacher would be mad if you called  THEM by the wrong name/one they explicitly said not to call them, so why is it a big deal to ask them to call them their preferred nickname?

We can go down a whole train of thought here - If a kid moves here from a foreign country, we need to do our best to pronounce their given name properly. If someone doesn't like nickname, we don't use them. If they *do* like nicknames, we use them. It isn't hard to just call people what they want to be called.

That doesn't happen.\n\nYou go to a foreign country, they ask you your name, they call you that name. They might inadvertently butcher the pronunciation but they will aim for what you tell them.

Even if you can't make the change for yourself it helps pave the way for others who will come after you.", "What the fuck are you on about?", "Not if the parents know the law. I was unfairly targeted by a teacher in my senior year of high school but because my grandpa was a retired superintendent and even taught my schools current superintendent, he put an immediate stop to it and my teacher got in big trouble.", "Lol you don\u2019t know how to get traction.

Monolingual Spanish speakers generally pronounce my name wrong. They do not pronounce the end of my name, which changes it into a different word completely. Many of them think that's my name till I spell it for them. My name genuinely isn't that difficult, so it annoys me that the bare minimum of effort is not given, but it's not a battle I want to continue fighting for the rest of my life.

It's not \"special treatment,\" it's literally just basic respect.", "Calling someone by a preferred name isn't special treatment, it's being respectful.  Teachers may be an authority, but that doesn't mean that they don't have to respect their students.  If other students request to be called by their real name they should also be respected.

Like Juan doesn't have a J 'sound', more like a Q and a W had a drunken boink. But we would pronounce it as a soft WH.

Reading their alphabet on paper is the true difficulty there imo.\n\nMy name has an x in it and they tend to substitute it with ks because they don't have an x in their alphabet, and my sister's name start with a J and substituting it with I sounds the exakt same. I kinda wonder what your name is if they can't pronounce it correctly because they are really intuitive imo. Don't feel pressured to disclose it though.\n\nEdit: That reminds me, my middle name starts with an H and they actually don't have a proper substitute for that one and no one could pronounce it correctly yet. Haha.", "Down vote all you want Reddit, doesn't make you right though.", "Yeah! In my experience, at least in the beginning stages of learning a language, I think its easier for someone to keep that language's pronunciation of a name, or as close as you can get if its not a name with a \"local' version.

See the different letters? Juan pronounced by an English speaker and Juan as pronounced by a Spanish speaker are both Juan: The way J is pronounced is different, because accents, but both do start with a J. Alexandra and Alejandra are not the same name pronounced differently by different speakers, they are different names, because X and J are different letters.\n\nIf a native Spanish speaker struggled with Xs and, when trying to say Alexandra, softened up the X sound (as they will do) that would be fine, and be an accent.

I tried learning Russian and failed horribly, then gave up, I know how hard it is (good on you for sticking with it!), but for a name, I'd still try. I just don't believe we have any right to change how someone pronounces their name.  If they're okay with it or even change it completely for a foreign country, it's probably easier for everyone.  But having your name pronounced right (or at least people trying to) seems like a pretty basic sign of respect.  I did some work with English learning student in an elementary school and it was really important for them to be called by their name correctly (granted, they were hispanic names, which are generally much easier to pronounce than Russian).  We also had a lot of transfer students from Asia at our college who also asked to be called by their correct names.  I worked with some people from Nigeria for a summer, and god knows I mucked those up all the time, but I tried.  That's all that I think matters.  That's what I've been trying to convey with this comment thread. Hopefully, it hasn't been lost.", "But back to the OP, Alexandra DID ask to be called by her name, meaning she likely would in a country with a different language.  Even if she wouldn't, this teacher isn't a native English speaker, and they aren't in a Spanish speaking country.  Personally, I don't think I'd mind at all if my name were mispronounced, but totally changing it?  Nah, this is the name I chose for myself, and it's what I want to be called.", "I fully agree with this. A name is a huge part of someone's identity. I also like seeing the joy on people's faces when I pronounce their name right. Also, I feel like with kids, especially we should be helping then learn that it's okay to speak up when something makes them uncomfortable.", "Yeah man I was just making a point that you missed."]}
