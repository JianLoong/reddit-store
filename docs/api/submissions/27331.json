{"id": 27331, "submission_id": "16olxc2", "title": "AITA for not backing down on my daughter\u2019s teachers calling her the proper name?", "selftext": "My daughter, Alexandra (14F), hates any shortened version of her name. This has gone on since she was about 10. The family respects it and she\u2019s pretty good about advocating for herself should someone call her Lexi, Alex, etc. She also hates when people get her name wrong and just wants to be called Alexandra.\n\nShe took Spanish in middle school. The teacher wanted to call all students by the Spanish version of their name (provided there was one). So, she tried to call Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her and the teacher respected it. She had the same teacher all 3 years of middle school, so it wasn\u2019t an issue. \n\nNow, she\u2019s in high school and is still taking Spanish. Once again, the new teacher announced if a student had a Spanish version of their name, she\u2019d call them that. So, she called Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her but the teacher ignored her. My daughter came home upset after the second week. I am not the type of mom to write emails, but I felt I had to in this case.\n\nIf matters, this teacher is not Hispanic herself, so this isn\u2019t a pronunciation issue. Her argument is if these kids ever went to a Spanish speaking country, they\u2019d be called by that name. I found this excuse a little weak as the middle school Spanish teacher actually was Hispanic who had come here from a Spanish speaking country and she respected Alexandra\u2019s wishes.\n\nThe teacher tried to dig her heels in, but I said if it wasn\u2019t that big a deal in her eyes that she calls her Alejandra, why is it such a big deal to just call her Alexandra? Eventually, she gave in. Alexandra confirmed that her teacher is calling her by her proper name. \n\nMy husband feels I blew this out of proportion and Alexandra could\u2019ve sucked it up for a year (the school has 3 different Spanish teachers, so odds are she could get another one her sophomore year). \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695317663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16olxc2/aita_for_not_backing_down_on_my_daughters/", "score": 15066, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's pretty common in language classes to pick equivalent names for students as a fun means of immersion.

Your kid needs to learn that they have a right to enforce what theyre called, who they are etc. I think you did the right thing by allowing her that, sometimes we forget that smaller issues like this are teaching them where they fit in the world.

I'm sure the teacher would be mad if you called  THEM by the wrong name/one they explicitly said not to call them, so why is it a big deal to ask them to call them their preferred nickname?

We can go down a whole train of thought here - If a kid moves here from a foreign country, we need to do our best to pronounce their given name properly. If someone doesn't like nickname, we don't use them. If they *do* like nicknames, we use them. It isn't hard to just call people what they want to be called.

Nobody in Spain, Mexico or Argentina calls the US president \"Jose Biden\". Nobody called Bill Clinton \"Guillermo\". Nobody called George Bush (either of them) \"Jorge\". But Queen Elizabeth was La reina Isabel II, and King Charles is El rey Carlo III. And the Pope is Francis, Francisco, Franziskus, etc. \\[Curiously in English we no longer translate royalty - King Felipe VI of Spain does not become Philip; and his father wasn't King John; this sort of stopped at the First World War when Englishmen didn't want to call their enemy the German Emperor \"William\", preferring the more foreign-sounding Wilhelm. Before that we did translate royalty.\\]\n\nWhere the spelling does not change, local pronunciation is often followed.

However, I still think this level of sensitivity is going to be a huge issue for Alexandra as she grows up and mom and dad need to get to the bottom of it and help her with some resources on coping.

There were almost 100 extra police officers deployed in my city yesterday because one of the major public employee unions was targeted and offices defaced at the beginning of the week, so they had a large counter-protest. Most happened at school board offices or major intersections, or at provincial or federal government offices. My kid doesn\u2019t have a first period class so takes public transit which is why I worried. One of my options for her was to go on the school bus to arrive at the same time as everyone else, but she chose to continue her day as normal, and good for her! Just a little surprising as she\u2019d already had one (not school related) stressful due to change of routine days this week, so I worried about her mental health and adding a second out of routine day. \n\nWhile a lot of articles say it was (and the group is) anti-2SLGBTQ group (and they are), primarily they are an anti-trans group. (I picked this article because I know there\u2019s not a paywall.)", "I\u2019m torn on the issue. My daughter was scared to tell me because I\u2019m religious. But it\u2019s *my* religion. I\u2019m basically the exact opposite my parents were on that - we didn\u2019t have a choice except to be conservative Christians when I was growing up, until we moved out. If we weren\u2019t in church every Sunday there were consequences. (Loss of a certain privilege for a week, different for each of us but equaling the same result.) My father was the minister, so not really surprising.  I took the opposite with my kids, though there were still a couple of rules, mostly no pork in the house, don\u2019t care what you eat at your dad\u2019s. I pray, I wear hijab, I was active in the mosque until I got sick of the politics (between growing up with church politics, and then choosing to take on mosque politics I\u2019d had enough of adults throwing temper tantrums for not getting their way.) But my kids after we moved didn\u2019t participate at all. Before we moved, we were in a small town, tiny close knit religious community, and the two hours on a Saturday afternoon having my best friend as the Islamic class/Qur\u2019an class teacher with the grand total of less than a dozen other kids they were friends with, they liked. So I can see where if the family is a conservative very religious one of really any faith can potentially put the child at risk by being outed. Though if you\u2019re in a smaller school or community there\u2019s basically a guarantee that your parents will hear it through the grapevine eventually.  \n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019d be upset that my child didn\u2019t trust me enough to tell them. However, I\u2019ve had open age appropriate \u201csex ed\u201d conversations with them since they were able to ask questions.  Their school bus driver died extremely unexpectedly about ten years ago. I found out because I was and am friends with his husband. So my kids knew early on about the 2SLGBTQ community. \n\nI don\u2019t like the idea of outing anyone - kid or adult - without knowing the at home situation. There needs to be serious thought put into it, like is this child (using child but would mostly be teenagers) going to be safe emotionally if their family finds out? Is this child going to be safe physically? Is this child going to find themselves kicked out with no where to go and no money to do it? If we\u2019re going to out this child to their family, are we also going to have to call CAS because we\u2019ve created harm of some sort to this child? Are we creating a situation where this child is going to self harm? \n\nOntario\u2019s premier announcing to the media that all parents must be informed tells me two things - he\u2019s never put *any* thought into any of those questions, and if he has, he doesn\u2019t care about the answers to any of them, and is he prepared to increase the funding to the Ministry of Community and Social Services to help with an increase (no matter how small) to CAS agencies or municipal agencies that are responsible for finding safe shelter for suddenly homeless children?\n\nHad this been me or either of my siblings 20/25 years ago, I\u2019ve no doubt that there would have been verbal/emotional abuse and probably kicked out if we didn\u2019t keep quiet. My parents are still conservative Christians, but because of my daughter, their stance changed from mostly quiet condemnation to trying their best to use chosen name and pronouns.  My dad is 80. My daughter is just happy he\u2019s trying. But the only reason we got there is because I had to have her admitted on a psych hold last year because after my stepdaughter (who my kids were close to) died, my daughter attempted to end her own life three times in the course of a week, less than three weeks after my stepdaughter\u2019s death. My parents had to choose - their grandchild surviving and hopefully thriving, or continuing to self harm because she couldn\u2019t be herself with the people who helped raise her when she was younger after my kids dad wasn\u2019t in their lives for several years. I wish that scenario on no family, but I also know from people I\u2019ve had to cut out of my life over the things they\u2019ve said, that some parents would rather their child didn\u2019t exist (in total or just in their lives). \n\nSo yeah. The situation is complicated and there is drawbacks to both sides of mandatory reporting to parents, and I\u2019d rather move with caution than risk the child\u2019s life. The funny thing, Not in a haha way, but in a surprising way? Those among my community who know the entire situation, the ones that are the least supportive (meaning vocally not supportive) were born and/or mostly raised in Canada, in the Canadian school system. The ones that remind me just to love my child? They\u2019re the ones that have come here from Muslim majority countries, from refugee camps, from situations I could never fully understand. If you\u2019d asked me two years ago, I\u2019d have told you it would probably be the other way round.  \n\n(A lot of rambling and not sure if it really answers your question.)", "I know the question wasn't directed towards me but I personally don't support requiring parental notification. I can only assume that if a child wants to publicly transition without their parents' knowledge that it is because they have some indication (whether right or wrong) to feel that their parents would not be accepting or supportive. Forcing them to choose between either informing their parents before they are ready or continuing to hide at the one place they might be able to live their truth is damaging.", "Yeah, me too.

I mentioned stepping in, and she about had a heart attack over the mere thought.", "The girl would get roasted every time her name was said in any class. It would be unpleasant.", "The teacher can simply say Alexandra with a Spanish accent. There are both Alejandras and Alexandras in Latin America. I've known dozens of people named each. That would keep the Spanish vibe and also placate the whiny parent. Unless that's also considered \"a different name\".", "Nah, there was nothing wrong with the teacher asking to call the kid by another name. But when the kid asserted she didn't want to be called that, the teacher should've respected that boundary. Wanting to learn a new language shouldn't mean you have to let people call you a nickname you don't like.", "Yep. The whole point is that this is not a big deal at all, and the fact that it is such a big deal to her points to something else going on I think..", "Right? Why even bring up the shortened name thing. It has nothing to do with this at all lol", "OP's daughter would like to speak to a manager.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Same! I'm honestly relieved I'm not the only one x.x It would have been one thing if she was the only student dealing with it, but it's something *all* students were assigned. Why the heck should she get special treatment?\n\nMy own Spanish teacher was born and raised in Spain, spent teenage years in South America, and most of her young adult years in Mexico. She spoke English clearly and insisted on using the Spanish version of our names. Why? Because *that's what they would do in Spanish speaking countries.*", "Heyyy my name in spanish class was also diego, and my english name is nowhere close to that.", "Not always. I went to a very competitive school and people would pull out their tests and contest the answer to a question if they felt it was essentially the same. In the 7th grade, I had a friend who got a lower participation score than some of our classmates, so she made an excel sheet on how often each person raised their hand and was called on how often.", "Worst part is my brother in a totally different school was dubbed \u201cJuan\u201d so I was just little girl Juan \ud83d\ude02", "Literally think about all the Asian people (not just east Asians either) that have an explicit English name. I can guarantee you my friend who was born in Taiwan and recently immigrated to an English speaking country was not named Angela since birth.", "I think the key factor in this context is that native speakers would totally be willing to pronounce the name the way it's meant to be pronounced if they were able to, and any deviation is due to an inability to pronounce it due to lack of experience or practice because of a difference in availabile sounds or a difference in the way sounds are put together between languages. It's not done on purpose due to a disregard for the original name.", "Which is ok, because you chose to do that.\n\nIf you wanted, you could ask people to just say it normally. They might have some trouble, but for friends it might be worth it.\n\nOr you could just not care, and go with a new name that is easy to pronounce for the locals. \n\nBoth of these are good options.", "Just a fun fact; Paco and Pepe are hypocoristic (pet) names for Francisco and Jose. So choosing Paco/Pepe as a name (directly) would be weird in a lot of Spanish speaking countries.", "I was Eva Paz Torres - I received 3 entirely different names and was into it.", "I had a teacher who ended up being a coach for a sport I was involved in have it in for me\u2026for something my DAD did when he was a student. My dad stopped this guy from being abusive to a female student when my dad was a student. I go to the same school district years later and he holds a grudge. Not only that, but he held a grudge against my uncle in small town politics (in which they were both involved), against my younger male cousin, and then against my even younger female cousin when he was just a substitute. All because my 17 year old dad stood up to him being a jerk of a teacher to a 17 year old girl.", "Even if a teacher dislikes a student, they should be able to be professional about it. \n\nMy high school calculus teacher *hated* me. He was pissed that I didn't study and I didn't do homework and he still couldn't fail me because I aced the tests. Then he figured I'd at least do poorly on the AP exam due to not studying ever and nope, I was one of a handful from my school that year to get a 5. I'm good at math and he was a *really* good teacher, I couldn't have gotten away with that if his explanations in class weren't as good as they were. \n\nI had no idea he disliked me. He was as polite to me as he was to anyone else. He went on a JSA trip I was on and again, I had no idea. I only found out because he had my little brother as a student a few years later, saw the last name, and said \"please tell me you actually do homework\". My brother was very studious, and actually got his college recommendation letter from him. \n\nHe told my parents at the end of the year how much he disliked me, and how much of a joy my brother was to teach. Never held my behavior against my brother, and was plenty fair to me. I was a shitty student and his dislike was pretty reasonable.", "My 2nd grade teacher - we'll call her Miss J was a woman who had NO business working with kids.\n\nLong story somewhat shorter, when my mom went in for spring conferences with Miss J. Miss J told her that while I was very good student and very advanced, I also was very conceited, a braggart and thought myself better than the other students. My mom was very shocked to hear this as she'd never gotten any similar report prior to this and I was generally a quiet, introverted, bookish kid, so it would be out of character for me.\n\nSo, of course, my mom wanted to hear my side of the story. So, she told me what Miss J had said. I didn't even know what conceited meant - I had to ask. Of course, I start to cry (my mom approached it gently, but I was SO upset that my teacher thought so poorly of me) and told her that I didn't know what Miss J was talking about, but I'd do my best to be better in school.\n\nWell that weekend, there was a birthday party so my mom saw a number of other moms. They start talking and a couple other moms got the same report as I did. They were all equally baffled by it because it was *so* out of left field. Their daughters, all also bright and conscientious students, were also upset. \n\nMy mom, a teacher herself, knew this wasn't a coincidence and encouraged the moms to call a meeting with the principal and the teacher to discuss this further. Now, this was a strict Catholic school in the late 70's so a lot of the moms were afraid to do this (oh, how times have changed...), but because my mom was an educator herself, she was like \"oh, hell no\" and wanted to bring it to the principal's attention.\n\nSo, she called a meeting with the principal and Miss J. My mom asks Miss J for specific examples of my \"conceited behavior\" and how I was a \"braggart.\" Miss J stuttered and stammered and ultimately came up with with *absolutely nothing*, because it was 100% LIES. Then my mom brought up the fact that several other mothers had received similar reports about their daughters, also quiet, bookish kids, and their moms were equally surprised.\n\nShe could then see steam coming out of the principal's ears and Miss J sinking lower and lower in her chair. At the end of the day, nothing really came of it. Miss J pretty much just ignored me for the rest of the year. She'd correct my work and I'd be part of class activities, but she wouldn't call on me or acknowledge me personally in any way. My mom wasn't too concerned about it as, at that point, there was just shy of eight weeks of school left and she knew I'd be fine.\n\nMiss J did not, however, return to the school to teach the following year. Exactly no one was surprised.\n\nLooking back on it as an adult, I think Miss J was put off by a bunch of smart, confident 2nd graders and wanted to knock us down a few pegs, which is really quite pathetic when you think about it. I hope wherever she went, it was FAR from any children.", "Spanish teacher here. I don\u2019t do this.", "My elementary school Spanish teacher did that when we were 7th and 8th grade. \n\nThen I took 4 years of Latin in high school and our teacher was a true force of nature and I adored her. She called us \"Miss (LN) or Master (LN)\", but would occasionally come up with a nickname for when you messed up (or around). My favorite was a boy who was a bit of a cut up - she called him \"Carthaginian Duff\". \n\nThanks for bringing up the memory!", "No, we definitely don't all do that and it's falling out of practice for multiple reasons. Personally I'm not memorizing an extra 120-150 names per semester in addition to the ones I already have to memorize. The whole \"but that's what they'll call you!\" bit only works if the language doesn't have a sound that's in your name. (Like Japanese and my maiden name, which contained an L.)", "I did this in Spanish when I was a kid and it was fun.\n\nI'm a teacher, and I'd personally abide by the request because I think it's important for students to be comfortable with how they are addressed, but I do see the teachers point, and I don't think it would have been absolutely terrible to tell the child to suck it up for the year. Sometimes we have to participate in things we don't want to when it comes to school/work.\n\nI see both sides of this, honestly.", "Me llamo Culo Blanco.", "Professor Snape?", "That's the WORST. Music teachers should understand passion and what happens if it isn't nurtured. I was fortunate in that I had amazing music teachers throughout school. I would have suffered so much if they had not been as music was my outlet, in my toxic ass home. If a teacher is okay with subpar lessons and leading with bitterness, they need to find a different job. A lot of kids are already being treated like shit at home, and school should be an escape, not just another prison term.", "I once took my dog on the Toronto subway where an older bald man all dressed up in a gorgeous gown and great makeup gave our doggie so many, many pats and cuddles all the way into town. I was in awe of his fashion sense. It is one of my most fondness memories of living in Toronto.", "I was Rafael for 4 years of Spanish classes and it was fucking awesome.", "I remember this from my French taking days, back in the mid 1990s. IIRC, because to my everlasting regret I didn't keep up on it and only took it through my Sophmore year, there's no \"th\" sound so Heather has no French pronunciation thus in middle school I became  Helen and in high school there were 2 of us with the same name so I picked Monique because I thought it sounded exotic.", "We had a Paco too! He was Italian and very pale.", "The reality is that most things have more than one legitimate side / opinion.", "I imagine It\u2019s just something fun that spread from one language teacher to another. Or a student remembered it and did it when they became a teacher. And then it just became commonplace. How do any trends and traditions spread? \n\nThe idea is creating immersion, of sorts. Like committing to only speaking Spanish while in Spanish class. And it\u2019s fun and engaging and gets the kids involved on day one of jumping in the language and culture that you will be learning. \n\nIn my Spanish classes there was always the idea and expectation that English was left at the door and in that classroom it was Spanish only (for the most part.) So picking a Spanish name is kind of part of committing to this little Spanish world in the classroom, separate from the English world outside.", "My middle school German teacher had us pick German names.  I thought it was fun  picking something new.  I'd have hated if I was the only one forced to pick a new name or if only some people got called German versions of their name or something.  So one wants to be singled out at this age.\n\nFunny enough,  many years later I met a woman with my German name and I told her about it.  She was like \"WHY would you pick this name?!\"  (I liked the alliteration with my last name lol)", "My 5th grade teacher hated me because of my uncle. They were in school together and her first day as a transfer student he joked that he saw her looking at his spelling test from across the room when they were the only students to get 100%. She refused to call on me in class because \"students who always raise their hands are just show-offs like [my uncle's full name]\"  She also hated my mom for chuckling at the spelling test story the first time she heard it at a professional development day (they worked together).", "Sounds like your dad set him straight.   If my child was being bullied by someone I had history with, I\u2019d tear them a new one for stooping so low.", "I'd love to see someone fail at \"making trail mix\".", "On behalf of the majority of religious people, and probably Catholics, I'm sorry you got treated that way, and fuck them. That is all.", "Okay, this isn\u2019t a revenge teacher, but interesting. Went to Catholic school for 9 years. In like the fifth grade on I noticed my parents knew what we did wrong in school before we could even lie about it, I mean explain our side. Around 7th grade I accidentally found out how they were on to us. Turns out my dad was one the beer and cigarette connections for the nuns. Plus my dad had his State Farm like two blocks from the school, so they had a direct line to him. All the men that were ushers at church on Sunday would take turns helping them out. Then in 8th grade we had the two nuns that taught the 8th classes over to hang with my parents to hang and have a few beers. Oh and was the first time we saw them without their habits, in street clothes. Gets better, that summer we had the principal, also a nun, over for a cookout. Again no habit, street clothes and drinking beer while talking to me. Also turns out she was drop dead gorgeous in street clothes, taking major MILF, and I think a few of the dads that were there may have had a rough night they way they were all \u201cchecking\u201d her drink all day long. I know my dad did.", "She wasn't the only teacher who treated me like shit. My brother and sister were total troublemakers and we all went to the same schools so once a lot of teachers found out what my last name was, I became a target.\n\nLuckily in high school, I had a few teachers who just loved me and nurtured my other artistic talents. :-)", "That is very true! She was basically a walking display of what not to do when it comes to parenting and teaching.", "I don't believe it did because he swapped into sweats with pockets by lunchtime, and he had stuff in his pockets.  I think the skirt wasn't comfy and/or practical for whatever job he'd been assigned.  But  it sure looked good!", "Japanese American.", "She legit thought the problem was that she had misidentified you, rather than punishing a child in your care for the actions of someone else...", "Had similar experience.  Older siblings and cousins were years ahead of me.  Had to keep explaining which ones were my siblings each year as my cousins had a reputation.", "My mother was excommunicated after my father left her. She was completely devastated.", "What does \u201cchecking her drink\u201d mean exactly?", "WTF?!?! Like how the hell is it your fault that your siblings were shitheads??? Way to teach kids that they are only as good as the rest of their family. This is disgusting.", "I\u2019ll allow it.", "That is insanely fucked up to treat you and your mom like that, especially by the principal! Hypocritical as FUCK behavior. You'd think they'd have, if anything, the utmost respect for your mom.  During the difficult time of being a divorcee, she was still so dedicated to God (which of course, Catholic schools would want you to be dedicated) that she didn't take the cheaper way out by sending you to public school. She struggled hard to send you to an environment that the principal would argue is the BEST place for a child of a \"sinful divorcee\" to be at. Students and their parents that administrators deem to be from an \"imperfect\" family are the EXACT people that Christians want to reach out to and befriend. Treating them like you were treated is the pinnacle of hypocrisy, especially from a principal of a goddamn Catholic school. That principal and any other superior who condoned that behavior are the last people who should be called Christians (and again, I say that as a not particularly religious person). I don't usually put so much energy and rage into random Reddit comments, but I was already in a bad mood and this treatment towards you and your mom (who, I repeat, was managing to show her dedication to her faith by sending you to that school and should have been the last person to ridicule like that) is really pissing me off tonight lmao.", "I was also short compared to them so the teachers harassed me by saying \"Oh you can't be John and Jane's little sister, they're both so tall!!!\" CONSTANTLY.\n\nMy brother is 6'7\" and my sister is 6'0\".
