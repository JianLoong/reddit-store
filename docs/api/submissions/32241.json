We\u2019ve been together for almost 2 years. She has a daughter (almost 2 years old) from a previous relationship. Bio dad isn\u2019t in the picture. \n\nThe wedding was back in September. Her daughter was around 18 months old at that point. She was going to be our flower girl. \n\nWe had arranged for her regular babysitter to stay with her during the ceremony and take her home for the reception but right when the wedding started, she had a meltdown and only wanted her mom so my wife held her through the entire wedding ceremony. She got hungry and cranky during the ceremony so my wife tried passing her off to the babysitter so she could have a snack but she wasn\u2019t having it so my wife held her daughter while her daughter was eating a ziplock bag of dry cereal during our wedding ceremony. She was also with my wife throughout the reception. \n\nWe just got the pictures back and a lot of them have the baby eating cereal on my wife\u2019s hip in them. I told my wife I wanted to photoshop her out of some of the pictures and put the photoshopped ones up, at least make it look like the wedding went the way we planned it. \n\nMy wife thinks the pictures with her daughter are cute and wants to hang those up. She doesn\u2019t see why we would photoshop anybody out of our wedding pictures. \n\nI told her I wanted the pictures to look a little more elegant and a baby eating cereal out of a ziplock bag isn\u2019t exactly elegant. \n\nShe\u2019s upset now because she thinks I\u2019m trying to erase her daughter and is currently sleeping in her daughter\u2019s room.", "created_utc": 1701586297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189nue0/aita_for_wanting_to_photoshop_my_stepdaughter_out/", "score": 1446, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Put those pictures up. And also the unphotoshopped pictures from the actual wedding", "NTA\n\nI was ready to be angry with you from the title -  but you're not trying to remove your SD from your wedding altogether...you're trying to get some pictures of you and your bride on your special day that don't include a tantrumy toddler and her snacks.  There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nEdit: All of you saying he's TA are not seeing that he stated he wants *SOME* photos to be edited while others will still include the SD.", "Why are you trying to create fantasy photos of a wedding that didn't happen the way imagined it might?  What happened happened.  You married a woman with a young child, and that child ended up being right in the middle of things. Accept this with good humor and put up pix of the wedding you actually had.  Things do not always go to plan.  The more you can learn to see the humor and roll with things and smile about them afterwards, the happier you will all be.\n\nedited: YTA", "I have a friend who is a photographer and he likes to have a session with the couple after the wedding, with them dressed in their bridal attire, but a more natural make-up and hairstyle. And he takes them to some lovely place that is meaningful to them. Sometimes that's a meadow, a cereal field, a museum, a park... Could that be an agreeable option for both of you?", "Maybe not an AH but you it\u2019s a weird hill to die on. Why do you want to make things fake? I think this is just a basis for more problems you\u2019re going to have raising another man\u2019s child. You may not even be aware you have a problem with it", "NAH. I\u2019m a marriage celebrant and this is SUCH a common experience. I always suggest that when there are kids under 4 you have someone who can take the kid out of the ceremony space if they get overwhelmed (which happens almost every time because their whole day has been completely out of routine) and they get so stressed out that no one has a good time. \n\nMost people don\u2019t believe me, or insist that they\u2019ll be fine to hold their kid through the ceremony, so what inevitably happens is that the ceremony gets put on hold while they try to calm the child down. The kid isn\u2019t having a good time and fusses, the couple spend their time being parents instead of focusing on each other and their vows and the guests feel tense. \n\nSo I completely understand where you are coming from with your feelings. The ceremony was meant to be about you and your wife and it suddenly became all about SD. And it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just the reality of being a parent. But I can see why you\u2019d want just a couple of nice photos of just you and your bride. \n\nBut I can also understand why your wife would feel touchy about your request, especially since SD is not your bio kid, so there could be that worry about you not valuing her. \n\nAs others have suggested, a make-up couples shoot might be a better way to go. And hey, why not wear get more use out of your wedding outfits?", "I was initially going to go hard YTA from the title, but this seems kind of reasonable. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you want to erase your step daughter from the event, you just want some nice photos to remember your wedding. That's understandable. Idk why everyone here is all up in arms about this, people get their wedding photos altered and it almost never receives any backlash.\n\nI would explain to your wife that you can still keep the original photos, there's no reason not to. It's not like photoshopping a photo instantly removes the original from history.\n\nOr, suggest a photoshoot of your wedding attire? Get some nice professional photos done that way.\n\nNTA", "How about you compromise? Keep some pics as they are and photoshop a few for the 'elegance' factor. This way, you both get what you want without stepping on each other's toes.", "NAH at the actual request, which I don't see as unreasonable. I have a child myself and yes, I would absolutely Photoshop him out of a pic where, say, he was pulling a face while I was looking my best. I am more concerned at you referring to your stepdaughter as \"her daughter\" throughout your entire post. You've been in her life almost as long as she's been alive. Do you consider her your daughter? Is Photoshopping her out really because of the messy cereal or because you don't truly view her as part of your family?", "YTA. \n\nWhy are you referring to the child as \u201cher daughter\u201d? You\u2019ve been in her life pretty much since she was born, based on the timeline, and it seems like you are the only father figure. Is this not also *your* daughter? I agree with your wife that it seems like you are trying to erase her daughter. \n\nThere must be some photos without the baby in them. I assume you took the traditional wedding photos with various family members. Put them up and also include the ones with the baby that your wife clearly loves. Life is messy, especially when children are involved, and those photos capture that.", "YTA - Photos of events are representative of said event; they don\u2019t reflect our failed plans, but life as it was lived. Your stepdaughter was at your wedding. Your stepdaughter is part of your life. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t ideal, and I understand wanting a photo of just you and your wife. But I think the answer then would be to get a picture taken now if you both still have your wedding attire. It may not be on the actual wedding day but you can still have the \u201celegant\u201d photo you want.\n\nI think photoshopping the baby out of the picture sends a bad message. It might make your wife feel like you\u2019re trying to erase her daughter from your life, even if that\u2019s not what you intend.", "INFO: You said that \u201ca  lot\u201d of the pictures had the baby eating cereal in them. So, that means not all of them did. Are you saying that there isn\u2019t a single non-baby picture in the entire collection of wedding photos? Not a single picture of just you and your wife that doesn\u2019t require photoshop? Because you could have said \u201call\u201d the pictures if that\u2019s what you meant.\n\nYou also said that you want to hang the photoshopped ones. Does that mean that you don\u2019t want any of the ones including your stepdaughter hung up?", "NAH. The photos and photoshopping are just the smoke of the proverbial fire: You married someone with a young kid, and there is unresolved tension about the overall dynamic.\n\nForget the photos. Talk out the underlying issue. This stuff is hard. You\u2019re in a super challenging emotional tangle. There\u2019s a small kid. There\u2019s a fresh marriage. This will take time.\n\nPeople will up- or downvote based on \u201ewho is right\u201c, but that\u2018s irrelevant here. Everyone is right, and at the same time that\u2019s not going to resolve anything. You (all three of you) have a lot of emotional work ahead of you.\n\nEdit: Consider a therapist\u2019s help. Mediation makes the first steps much smoother.", "No. NTA. Babysitter was hired to avoid EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. Everyone here just needs to stop acting like he\u2019s trying to \u201cerase the baby\u201d. Good grief people. He\u2019s not saying that at all. I\u2019m just imagining what this thread would look like if the gender roles were reversed. Everyone would be screaming that the guy couldn\u2019t put his kid down so the bride could have her \u201cperfect day\u201d.\n\nOP is mourning the loss what was supposed to be a day about him and his new wife. And instead it became all about her kid. I feel like he just wants to be seen. And the new wife\u2019s inability to do that may not bode well.  Unfortunately what happened, happened. There\u2019s no changing it. But it warrants a conversation with the new wife. Hopefully one she can engage in without acting like he\u2019s trying to \u201cerase her daughter\u201d.", "NTA. I get it. I babysat for a lovely couple and their daughter (who I adore to this day) on their wedding day. I walked down the aisle with their daughter, I held her during the ceremony, walked her around when she got restless, and when it was time for pics she was in a few and then I whisked her off so they could have their own pics. It\u2019s not an unreasonable request. Toddlers get cranky, and of course as her mother she should attend to her. But you got her a sitter for this exact reason and she would\u2019ve been crying for all of two minutes to get some decent photos. What was the point in paying for a sitter if she wasn\u2019t going to actually use the sitter? A few photoshopped photos is no big deal.", "YTA. You got together when she was heavily pregnant, and you didn't realise that her child was going to be a permanent fixture? Good on her for keeping her daughter from screaming during the whole ceremony. I get that it didn't turn out the way you wanted, but you can't just handwave a whole child away with Photoshop.", "NTA you're allowed to have a few wedding photos of just you and your spouse. People photoshop out all sorts of things just to have a few nice, simple wedding photos. When you look at your wedding portraits it's okay to say \"wow look at us on our wedding day\" instead of \"wow look at the baby munching on cereal next to us while we're getting married!\" Your stepdaughter doesn't need to be the centre of attention in all your wedding photos, she can be the center of attention when she gets married as an adult. None of this is \"trying to erase\" your stepdaughter just because you don't want her in every photo shovelling cheerios into her mouth.", "NTA. The regular babysitter should have taken the screaming baby Away from the mom at least during the ceremony and stepped out of there. Can\u2019t your wife give her full attention to you at least during the vow taking ? Does she always give in during a tantrum ?", "I'm going nta. I don't think it's bad at all to have some photos hanging up of the 3 of you & also a picture or two of you 2 alone. \n\nDoesn't need to be that big of a deal. I have children. If I married someone & this happened I wouldn't throw a fit. I would also want some photos of just us.", "You didn't manage a single photo of just the two of you? If pictures are that important to you then I assume you did the usual wedding photo shoot with various combinations of friends and family? Did your wife refuse to hand the baby to someone else for the few seconds it would take to grab a picture of just the couple?\n\nIt sounds like you married a helicopter mum. Holding her baby throughout the ceremony? That's very inconsiderate of you. Babysitter could have taken fussy little one out of the room for just a few minutes. Asking to photoshop baby out of some of the pictures was a stupid move. Whatever made you think that would be okay? I facepalmed as soon as I read it.\n\nI'm going ESH. The babysitter for not removing the fussy child, your wife for not being considerate of you on your wedding day, you for even asking something like that. You two need to apologise to each other and book a separate photo shoot.", "NAH I think both of your feelings are valid and can see both sides. Hopefully a compromise can be reached. I would explain and make it clear that this isn't about erasing her daughter from the event (I think this is how she feels) and you just wan't a couple of nice pictures of the 2 of you. I also think it's important to display the ones with your step daughter. She is part of your family now and deserves to be represented even if the pictures aren't perfect in your eyes.", "NAH or ESH, I can't decide. You both make good points, you are both being stubborn and inconsiderate of the other person's POV. \n\nIf I may suggest a possible de-escalation solution:\n \nOur photos of the day were disappointing, with no good formal or elegant ones. We booked a studio shoot the following weekend with just the two of us. (The bouquet just survivied). So we have two sets: informal of the day as it was, and formal portraits of the couple alone.", "YTA for literally every single thing in this story. Why wasn't you stepdaughter part of your day? You think the wedding was just about you and your bride? This is the day you became a stepdad, the day you became a family. You want to pretend this kid doesn't exist. Pass her off to the babysitter, really? This isn't your cousin's kid or your friend's newborn - this is the bride's daughter. \n\nAnd the biggest thing? Your wife doesn't want her daughter out of the photos. Respect that. You don't deserve these two girls.", "I think everyone\u2019s forgetting that he didn\u2019t just do it, he asked if he could .", "NTA for trying to get that classic couple shot even though it\u2019s after the event. Wedding photos - the kind that gather dust on the mantle until your 25th anniversary party - are staged anyway, they\u2019re not photojournalism. \n\nHowever\u2026your new wife doesn\u2019t care what you want so good luck with being right I guess.", "NTA \n\nIt's your wedding photo, of course you want some of them to be only of you and your wife. Nothing wrong with that. You even had a babysitter but things like this happen. So if you want to Photoshop then why is that wrong?", "NTA you can photoshop some pics and that is why ppl don\u2019t want toddlers at weddings even they\u2019re your own", "Good grief, the amount of people jumping the gun, so eager to \"call out\" the OP is ridiculous. \n\nHe has made no indications that he wants to abandon the child. He wants a few pictures of just him and his wife on their wedding day. You know - THE MARRIED COUPLE. \n\nThe child was at the wedding, and behaved as a baby is wont to behave. Ultimately, the mother needed to decide what to do during the ceremony. \n\nShe kept the crying child in the ceremony - understandable, OK. \n\nShe got pictures with all of them together - nice, fine. \n\nHusband wants a handful of photos with just his wife - THIS IS OK TOO. Not everything has to revolve around the child.", "NTA. Your wife should collaborate with you to edit some of the pics and you should agree that the unedited versions are also valid. Where you are risking being the AH is the way you are addressing the child. You need to wrap your head around the fact that it\u2019s basically yours as well.", "NTA", "I\u2019m confused by a lot here, you\u2019ve been with her almost two years and the kid is almost two. So you started dating right around when the baby was born? I\u2019m baffled as to how or why a single parent of an infant was dating. \n\nAlso, how long was the ceremony that she got so hungry and couldn\u2019t wait until it was over?\n\nBut to the question. NTA. She\u2019s being dramatic. You\u2019re allowed to want some nice photos of you and your spouse from your wedding ceremony. You\u2019re not editing her out because you don\u2019t want her in any pictures, you\u2019re doing it because she was up with you guys during the ceremony which was not the plan or desire but due to necessity.", "NTA It was not a baptism for the kid it was a wedding.I have never seen wedding pictures with a toddler. It is your wedding and I don't blame you at all.", "NAH but this isn\u2019t the hill to die on.  Let it go.", "As a mom, NTA. But hear me out..\n\nShe\u2019s sleeping in her daughter\u2019s room because she\u2019s mad at you? No wonder the kiddo can\u2019t be without her mom for one minute. But, that aside\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to *want* photos of how you wish your wedding went. But, fast forward to when your daughter (i say that because why say step if she only has you) is older and this is all a distant memory and not really that important. Imagine explaining to her that you photoshopped her out. It just sounds kinda funny. Whether it\u2019s how you planned it or not, she was a part of that day and yes, your wife played right into her little hand\u2026but those are your girls now, bag of cereal and all.", "NTA you aren\u2019t removing her from every photo, just a few. It\u2019s a reasonable request. I u derata s why your wife is upset but it was your wedding too. You should have pics that reflect your wedding vision, too.", "NTA I used to be a wedding photographer and I believe that every couple need a few at least of just themselves that are frame worthy. I am sorry you didn't get that", "It is my experience that the people who perfectly curate photos to give the illusion of a perfect life/marriage/family are the ones trying to prove something that others don\u2019t feel the need to. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA - I think this is completely fair. As others have said, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re trying to remove her completely but at the same time you want memories from your day to look a certain way. It\u2019s your day too.  \n\nIt\u2019s not like you can\u2019t keep both versions of the photo and that way. It\u2019s if you can be happy.", "I mean, I sort of see what you\u2019re wanting to do but the reality of your wedding was toddler eating snacks. As a mum, there\u2019s something quite cute about the reality those pictures capture. You didn\u2019t have an adult only, elegant wedding so why try to pretend you did? \nI\u2019m assume you still have the wedding dress and suits? Why not go and have a photo shoot with just the two of you? Get some \u2018just the two of you looking all gorgeous and in love\u2019 pictures but also embrace the new family you have with the actual ceremony pictures. \nNAH", ">Bio dad isn\u2019t in the picture. \n\nWell that's one less thing to edit.", "I get Mom\u2019s feelings might be complex but imagine being the daughter at 15. Your friends come over and your parents have a prominently displayed picture of you gobbling cheerios out of a bag at their wedding. I\u2019d nag them to take down their wedding pictures if I were her, and her parents will probably not want to hide pictures of their wedding. If only someone had thought to address it in 2023. Alas, words of mice and men, etc", "NTA I think it's reasonable to want like one photo shopped, but friendly suggestion you guys gotta handle meltdowns better than utterly giving in like that or that kid will own you lol.", "When you married your wife you became a family. Her daughter was part and parcel of that and you knew it. I am at a loss as to why people are so concerned with the weddings aesthetic. Enjoy the day for what it was.", "YTA\n\nYou married her KNOWING she had a young child and now you want to pretend the kid doesn\u2019t exist?\n\nThe photos show that life happens and rather than get upset about it, It\u2019s something you laugh about with the daughter in years to come \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if an annulment comes your way because you NEVER should of married her if you won\u2019t accept her child", "Yeah. YTA.\n\nThis is how your wedding went. You won't change it with Photoshop. Photoshopping them won't give people who weren't there a \"better\" view of the event - at best, it'll make them look like generic wedding pictures that will need to be explained anyway if this was such an impactful part of the day. At worst, it'll just look confusing and ugly (a toddler on the hip affects someone's whole posture, idk how you would hide that even if you're successful editing out your stepdaughter). \n\nMost importantly: YOU SIGNED UP FOR THIS. When you chose to marry your wife, you chose to take your stepdaughter into your life. That means being there for her when she's feeling insecure and clingy. She's a two year old for heaven's sake!", "NTA. Same thing happened at my son\u2019s wedding. Only the child of 10 months was his also. Baby had a meltdown and only wanted mom. I was about to, but the other grandma came to their rescue and bounced and cajoled him around the venue. Wedding was short and sweet so she didn\u2019t miss much. \nSo\u2026why didn\u2019t a grandma or other family member take \u2018her daughter\u2019 (yeah, that\u2019s stupid) out and distract her? That would have solved everything!", "\ud83d\ude44\n\nYTA. I understand you want a few pictures of just you and your wife, that's fine 100%. The issue I have with your post is that those are the ones you want to display. Whether you like it or not, your SD is in your life. There should be pictures of her, you and your wife that you want displayed, as well as just 1 or 2 of just you and your wife.\n\nFYI, not ONCE did you mention that you love your SD, treat her as your own, etc. You consistently complained about her behavior that day. She's 2 years old. Her mother is her world and vica versa. \n\nYou mentioned her biodad isn't in the picture, so you very well are her dad in many ways, especially since you've been in their lives since she was practically born. I now wonder about how you treat this little girl: is she simply a burden to you or do you actually care and love her? You married into a family, not just a woman. Start acting like it.\n\nEdit: I speak from experience with bio and step kids. I have pics of my bio and step everywhere. I purposely chose a family photo that is the main one on display in my living room with my step in it. Why? Because I love them and they are family. I have much better pics of just me, hubs and bios, but step isn't included, which isn't right. They are family and should be displayed for all to see.", "[deleted]", "Hard to say who's wrong.  Why was the wedding timed for the daughter to have a tantrum and be tired and hungry.  I can understand her being overwhelmed by the people and activity.  But really,  time it for the child to have had a nap and some food so the parents get the maximum benefit.  \n\nAnd yes I do know what I'm talking about in case I get shitted on for that.", "YTA.\n\nThe photos represent what actually happened - a cranky and overexcited toddler needed her mom.\n\nIf you want \u201cperfect\u201d photos of you two in your wedding clothes, wait a few months until you\u2019ve apologized enough for suggesting that your stepdaughter be literally erased from the wedding, then suggest a re-shoot. Without all of the chaos of the wedding, you\u2019ll have better luck at getting those dream shots of the three of you that you wanted. Please note: the emphasis needs to be on THE THREE OF YOU. You can suggest some shots of just you and your wife but the wedding made the three of you a family unit, so that needs to be the focus.", "YTA.

Whether it fits your ideal image for your wedding or not your wife had a baby eating cereal with her Photoshopping it out is like lying to yourself and to her I'm betting it seems like you're ashamed and embarrassed by your new family which isn't exactly the best message to send for newlyweds.", "YTA. Welcome to parenthood.\n\nAlso, a marriage is supposed to be a union between two people--two *whole* people, not just the elegant parts.

Because it looked weird on some of them. \n\nI was accused of not loving my baby as he is, and that I value social media higher than the natural photographs (I don't even have Facebook or Instagram) and I was accused of trying to curate a lie instead of embrace the day of the photosession as it is. \n\nTo exclude your wifes daughter from the photos against her wishes is an AH move. \n\nA better compromise would be to just edit out the cereals.

I will never understand photoshopping a moment to fit your narrative. Photos tell a story and photoshopping that story is manipulating reality.

We had nobody who could manage him and I was just asking for one day where the focus was on *us* as a couple. I planned a family bonding ceremony as a more child friendly moment for us all. I'm talking so clingy my husband couldn't even take a dump without a six year old huffing his poop fumes from inches away. \n\nPeople get so sensitive regarding blended family situations. OPs ceremony was pretty wrecked and it's okay to feel that way and it's okay to be bummed about the crummy pictures. \n\nA good compromise might be just getting a romantic photo shoot done or something that is child free. It won't fix the past, but it'll give him some lovely photos. Unless he's outright banning photos of kid in the house, he's not erasing her. Couples have to exist as COUPLES as well as parents.

We now have 4 and yes they are our world, but at the center of everything is our relationship.

There are plenty of options that don't involve 'waiting 18 years'.\n\nI don't think the kid is TA, but I think the wife is for not understanding why her husband might want a nice picture of them without a kid and her snacks, and for sleeping in the kid's room as a toooooootally rational response to her husband's request.

The fact you ignoring these red flags tells me you found someone physically out of your league but she dated you because guys in her league physically decided her baggage put her below their league especially considering she jumping from dick to dick trying to find a sucker to take over her responsibilities instead of growing up and taking responsibility.
