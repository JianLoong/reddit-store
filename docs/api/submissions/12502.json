We aren\u2019t finding out the gender and keeping it neutral (also one of the doctors kept saying he during an ultrasound and I just kinda ignored it) I even told her at the beginning of the pregnancy when she asked my plans that I am finding environmentally safe disposable diapers she mentioned cloth, I said no. That was 4 months ago. She has also flat out TOLD me she will be moving in for a few months after baby is born. She has the habit of stepping over boundaries and being a bitch. She got fired from her job because she told her boss to eat shit and she bragged about it.\n\nEdit 2: she cussed and blocked my husband too. So guess she isn\u2019t seeing the baby anyways.\n\nEdit 3: this was just the last straw. I said in a comment how she is racist and had her kids taken away. She is black I am white. She is made many comments on how the child is a half Breed and how she only wants in its life because the rest of her kids are gay and they cut her off.", "created_utc": 1679019331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11te8nn/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_near_my_baby/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mother called me when I was at the 5 month mark to talk about cloth vs disposable because she feels strongly about it. I told her it wouldn't work for us for literally the same issues you have (increased laundromat time/price + newborn = no, ty), and she said she understood then asked if I would be willing if she solved the issues (I was intrigued)\n\nEnd result, I found out about diaper service which my mom paid for as part of our baby gifts. If it means that much to her and you're willing to use cloth, tell her she can set that up and pay for it herself. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAssuming you ever speak to her again, which I doubt anyone would blame you if you did not. \n\nAlso, congratulations on the baby \ud83d\udc76", "Your mil sucks.

Of course her reaction also makes her an asshole", "Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. You both are crappy in those messages. \n\nMILs reaction was crappy. It\u2019s crappy of you to be picky and choosy about a gift. Understandable if you don\u2019t want to use cloth diapers for whatever reason. But don\u2019t be upset about a gift you don\u2019t want, just don\u2019t use it. \n\nMils reaction to your husband not having the registry is over the top. I created most of my baby registry. But my husband is informed and can speak about the registry. I personally find it odd your husband would direct his mom to you over this instead of explaining why cloth diaper won\u2019t be something you two would utilize, although all gifts regardless are appreciated. \n\nYou and mil don\u2019t have a loving relationship. You said nothing about her being dangerous to a baby. To not allow your husband\u2019s mother near the baby because she was rude to you is weaponizing the baby.
