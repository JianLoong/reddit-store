My two younger kids 7 and 8 mistakenly thought it was for everyone and got extremely upset when they realised they weren\u2019t going. My 11 year old just got awkward but was upset too. I didn\u2019t want to make the kids more upset and have a full blown fight with my sister infront of them so I just calmed them down. After I confronted my sister and told her she was cruel for doing that. My sister said she was annoyed with me too and my kids should have been happy for their cousin and my parents instead of causing a scene and that they\u2019re old enough to know better . She also said all the kids already had gifts so It\u2019s not like there was nothing for them. My parents don\u2019t get to see my niece as much as my kids so it is special for them but I still think it was cruel.", "created_utc": 1704455137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z512y/aita_for_confronting_my_sister_when_she_suprised/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s family 101 stuff. I obviously don\u2019t know your sister but I\u2019d wonder if she did that on purpose. I can\u2019t see any other reason why you couldn\u2019t foresee that the other kids would be upset in that situation", "NTA but your sister is a huge one.", "NTA - very cruel to do it in front on your kids. Could\u2019ve easily been done differently and not caused any drama.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a jerk", "Given your kids age, pretty dumb of your sis to break the news in front of them over Christmas. NTA, especially since you calmed the kids and didn\u2019t make a scene in front of them but took sis to task afterwards. That she stubbornly refused to accept her misstep confirms that she\u2019s the AH here.", "Your sister is evil. If your parents can\u2019t see that then maybe it\u2019s time to go LC/NC for the sake of your kids.", "NTA, but your sister definitely is. This was a deliberately cruel flex.", "NTA\n\nwhat your sister did was inappropriate.", "NTA\n\nYou have a year to save up and give her a taste of her own medicine. That was really cruel.", "Show her this thread so she can without a doubt know she is the A. And she is cruel.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is not the type of person who belongs in Disneyland.", "YTA because you get to pick the presents you give and so does your sister.\n\nIf this was a shared gift giving and everyone got a reasonable present you have little right to be offended.\n\nAt least you now know where you will be going on vacation next.", "NTA - Your sister knew exactly what she was doing when she did that.", "NTA.\n\nWhat your sister did was awful. She should have done it privately.", "NTA. I can't say what I'd like to say about the sister, because there are rules about being civil.", "NTA at all. That was a cruel and rude way to surprise the invited individuals. Unless they had to literally leave for the airport 5 minutes  after, there was no need to open the surprise in front of you and your kids, and it could've waited.", "NTA. Your sister was mean AF to do that.", "NTA what your sister did was cruel and inappropriate. She should of given it to them privately if it wasn\u2019t for everyone. Instead she just wanted to upset your kids and shove it in their face that their cousin? And grandparents get to go to Disneyland and they don\u2019t.", "NTA and it was a cruel thing for your sister to do. Expecting little children to 'be happy' for their cousin and grandparents for getting something they would love to have themselves is expecting far too much of them. It can be hard enough for an adult to 'be happy' for someone who gets something big which they would have loved to get for themselves, let alone for young children. Your sister should have told your cousin and parents privately.", "NTA\u2026.i have to say that I agree with you.  Yes, your kids are old enough to understand, but the way your sister went about her gift was wrong.  She could have done it before you all arrived or when leaving or at least given you a heads up.  I bet if the show were on the other foot, discuss be singing a  different tune.", "NTA, any parent know they have to be considerate with gifts especially around christmas, your sister is the AH for doing it infront of you and your kids", "NTA- your sister is mean", "NTA she wanted the spotlight of the big reveal and didn\u2019t care if that effected anyone else. Either that or she\u2019s stupid.", "I\u2019m 31 and my first cousins are 17&13 and I\u2019d still be marginally salty if there\u2019s a DL trip I wasn\u2019t invited on. Your sister knew what she was doing. NTA", "YTA. Your kids are old enough to not be entitled. I guess it is a first world thing, because my cousins got to go on elaborate vacations because their parents could afford it. I never got up set or was jealous.", "Nta your sister is though. This might be immature but just show that you don\u2019t care it after that talk to your kids  and maybe plan a trip with your family but not her family and announce it when she\u2019s around she\u2019ll see how it feels.", "NTA\n\nyour sister is, that was cruel. \n\nThat present should have been announced in private", "INFO: How did she gifted them the present?", "ESH", "NTA.\n\nIt is a f* holiday to Disneyland, of course kids were going to be excited. She should have communicated it with your parents and her kids in another moment, your kids may have known that anyways but that wouldn\u2019t be the same to be there once the \u201cpresent\u201d was unwrapped.", "NTA\n\nI was 8 yrs old when my bio-dad took step-mom, step-sister, and their relatives to Disneyland and left me behind. I am 62 now, and still remember the disappointment.  Share that with your sister - and I'd already been to Disneyland! It was being left out and having it shoved under my nose that hurt.", "YTA. If you want your kids to go to Disney, take them. Don\u2019t crap on your sister for giving your parents a mi e gift just because you didn\u2019t.", "I'm willing to bet your sister knew exactly what she was doing. I feel like any kid under teenage years would be at least somewhat sad and disappointed, your sister is delusional if she thinks that little kids are going to be \"happy\" for their cousin after deliberately being told they don't get to go, that sort of maturity doesn't develop until years after 7 and 8. Your sister was being cruel on purpose.  NTA but your sister is.", "Your sister is old enough to understand that what she did was unacceptable and cruel.", "The sister had everyone open it in front of them, they thought they were going. They are kids they got excited end then told \u201cyou are not coming\u201d. She should have some class and give the gift in another moment.", "Did your cousins get offered fancy vacations as a present while you watched?", "She had them open an envelope", "I'm sorry, that's so shitty of your \"family\".", "I was 20 and at uni when my mum took my sisters and cousin to Disneyland (they were all under 10). I've still not forgiven her for not waiting a week for my uni to finish.\nTeens and young adults get sad too!", "The grantparents or your niece? If so, YTA. Your niece and parents are allowed to get a present and trip by themself. It is not your sisters fault, that your children thought that they would be invited too. It wasn't their present.", "Which means your kids weren\u2019t given envelopes. I\u2019m not understanding how they thought it was for them?", "Okay so if she gave the ppl invited envelopes to open, why did your kids think they were invited? \n\nI understand disney (if you don't live close by) is very expensive but you can always take them yourself.", "Thanks! It was, but I turned out OK. \n\nIsn't it weird the sister can't imagine being a child and disappointed? Do people not remember being children themselves, and all the feelings?", "I\u2019m 23 and have my own kids, my mom is taking my 20 year old sister and my 4 year old baby brother and 7 year old step sister to Disneyland this year. I\u2019ve never gone and probably will never be able to afford to go. Family sucks tbh", "There was 1 envelope. My parents opened it but it was also for my niece", "My parents had assumed it was for them and all the grandkids and my niece said \u2018we\u2019re all going to Disney!\u2019. My sister didn\u2019t confirm straight away and the kids were confused", "Omg that's really cruel. NTA, your sister could have be a little bit considerate of the situation, I feel really sorry for you.\n\nAnd no, kids this age are not *happy for others* to go on a fun event without them, that's just not how childrens' brains work."]}
