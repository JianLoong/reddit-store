{"id": 13006, "submission_id": "11zr0gz", "title": "AITA for letting my girlfriend do most of the household chores because she doesn\u2019t pay as much of the rent as I do?", "selftext": "I (24M) work for a very prominent company and get paid a lot better than my girlfriend (23F). We both moved to a different state for my job, and she ended up with a very toxic work environment with a boss who was sexist and homophobic. She hated her job and ended up getting a new one that pays a lot less than her old one, and has asked me to take on the responsibility of paying most of the rent. \n\nSince we have been in this new state, she has done most of the cleaning. I contribute by doing the dishes sometimes and washing the laundry (she folds it). She is the only one who cleans the bathroom, the kitchen, and the only one who sweeps, mops, and vacuums along with other random chores here and there. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 8 months since we moved and everything was fine until recently. The other day she asked me to vacuum the living room and I said I didn\u2019t know where the vacuum was. Since then, she keeps bringing up how I need to do more of the housework, but I feel like because I contribute more to the rent she should be responsible for keeping the apartment clean. I also do the dishes sometimes and do stuff she asks me to do. \n\nI\u2019ve done more of the dishes since she brought it up (doing them maybe once a week instead of once every other week). She now leaves cleaning tasks for me to do without telling me about them and then gets upset when they aren\u2019t done. If she just asked me to clean those parts of the apartment then I would. She claims that I should know what needs to get done and just do them myself without making her bring it up first. Eventually she gets frustrated and just cleans by herself.\n\nI\u2019m also tired from working when I get home and I just want to relax or finish my work. She works the same amount of hours as me, but her job is much less demanding than mine so she is less drained by the end of the day. She does pay for our groceries and my gas sometimes as well as other little things here and there. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole for expecting her to contribute with the housework since I contribute more financially. AITA for letting her do most of cleaning since I pay for most of the rent?\n\nEdit: I just want to answer some of the more common questions I\u2019ve been seeing. We both work the same amount of hours each week. She has agreed that her job is less demanding than mine. We split the rent 60/40 so I pay about 60% of it right now. Her health concerns aren\u2019t an every day thing, but they come up a few times a month. I know where the vacuum is now. After receiving the comments I have, I really need to sit and reflect on how I am acting in this relationship. I recognize now that I have truly and deeply made a mistake with thinking paying more of the rent means that I should do less of the housework. I really love her and I value her so much, and I\u2019ve clearly done a horrible job at showing that.\n\nUpdate: I appreciate those of you defending me in the comments, but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I am the asshole. Please don\u2019t say anything negative about my girlfriend since she has not done anything wrong. She\u2019s tried talking to me about this and I have not been receptive. I\u2019m sorry for not responding to people, I was having a conversation with her. There\u2019s nothing I can do to make up for the past 8 months, and I was an idiot to think that my financial contribution was great enough to warrant not doing any chores. I would do anything to keep her, and I messed up thinking that this was a small issue. I hope she forgives me for not taking her concerns seriously, and I hope I can create an environment where she feels comfortable confronting me in the future if I\u2019m EVER acting like this again. It shouldn\u2019t have come down to strangers on the internet telling me I\u2019m an asshole to realize this, but thank you all for the wake up call so much. I am never going to dismiss her or all the hard work she puts into this relationship and our life together again. Im going to start doing the majority of the chores for the time being. I\u2019m also going to start paying more of the rent since I do make more. I don\u2019t pay more of the rent to have a housekeeper, I pay more of the rent because I love her and I want to support her.

You are telling me you do the dishes once every two weeks. Remember she is your GF and not your mom.

We both moved to a different state for my job, and she ended up with a very toxic work environment with a boss who was sexist and homophobic. She hated her job and ended up getting a new one that pays a lot less than her old one, and has asked me to take on the responsibility of paying most of the rent. \n\nSince we have been in this new state, she has done most of the cleaning. I contribute by doing the dishes sometimes and washing the laundry (she folds it). She is the only one who cleans the bathroom, the kitchen, and the only one who sweeps, mops, and vacuums along with other random chores here and there. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 8 months since we moved and everything was fine until recently. The other day she asked me to vacuum the living room and I said I didn\u2019t know where the vacuum was. Since then, she keeps bringing up how I need to do more of the housework, but I feel like because I contribute more to the rent she should be responsible for keeping the apartment clean. I also do the dishes sometimes and do stuff she asks me to do. \n\nI\u2019ve done more of the dishes since she brought it up (doing them maybe once a week instead of once every other week). She now leaves cleaning tasks for me to do without telling me about them and then gets upset when they aren\u2019t done. If she just asked me to clean those parts of the apartment then I would. She claims that I should know what needs to get done and just do them myself without making her bring it up first. Eventually she gets frustrated and just cleans by herself.\n\nI\u2019m also tired from working when I get home and I just want to relax or finish my work. She works the same amount of hours as me, but her job is much less demanding than mine so she is less drained by the end of the day. She does pay for our groceries and my gas sometimes as well as other little things here and there. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole for expecting her to contribute with the housework since I contribute more financially. AITA for letting her do most of cleaning since I pay for most of the rent?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I still help out with things on weekends or if I leave late/get home early.  When we are both working full time we split a lot more evenly because regardless of income/labour effort at work we are out of the house the same amount of time. \n\nI'll vote YTA but a redeemable one.

I will take them out and give her a break. And this is ON TOP OF us already splitting things 50/50. \n\nIf you don't even know where the vacuum is because that's how little you help out then yes you have a problem, but it's not with your GF- it's with you. You are the problem. \n\nLook up the term \"weaponized incompetence\" because that's what you are doing and if you keep it up you will find yourself single again.", "YTA. \n\nFirst, you assume that she should do most of the household chores because you pay more, not because you two discussed this and agreed to it. You don't get to unilaterally decide the fair/right split of chores on your own. \n\nSecond, you aren't \"letting her\" do the cleaning, it isn't a favor you are doing for her. \n\nMy personal belief is that chores should be split by work hours, not income. So if I make more than my partner but I work from home so have less commute time, or work less hours, then I do more of the stuff at home. Chores should be about what is practical- if I drive past a grocery store on the way home, I grab groceries, if my partner is home earlier, he starts dinner, I start a load of laundry on my way out, he goes to work later so puts it in the dryer.\n\n The only way how much each person pays should factor in is if there is an explicit agreement- hey I cannot pay as much as you, so how about I do X, Y, Z instead. You didn't do that. The conversation was about you picking up more bills so she could change jobs, which is a fine conversation, and you are showing up as a good partner by understanding that this is a moment for you to step up for her as she makes a change in life that is good for her, and therefore good for you both. \n\nBut you decided that this meant you could do so little around the home that you can't even FIND the vacuum.

Don't just assume that she should do more based on your internal rational. Discuss these things in advance.\n3) This may sound like it contradicts above, but you shouldn't have to be told all the time to help out. If you have working eyes you can see when the shower needs scrubbed, the dishes need done, the laundry needs to be put away, etc. It's completely irritating to have to ask a partner all the time to do basic daily tasks. Women want an equal partner, not an extra child they have to hound to do the chores. If that means having some sort of pre-discussed division of labor that's fine, but you shouldn't have to be told everytime something needs done around the house.\n4) In general, your post indicates a lack of respect for your partner and a sense of importance/entitlement about yourself. Be more supportive and considerate. Realize and appreciate what your partner brings to the table even if she earns less. Put yourself in someone else's shoes.

You also say she pays for all of the groceries. You don\u2019t mention the area you live (country, high vs. low cost of living area), so I\u2019m going to make some assumptions here: according to a quick google search, the national median cost of rent in the US is $1,937 (rent.com, not too sure on validity of that number but we\u2019ll roll with it). Let\u2019s round up to make it an even $2,000 so it divides well. Additionally, the USDA says the average THRIFTY monthly cost of groceries in February 2023 for a woman aged 20-50 is $243.50, and for a man the same age range is $304.40. So let\u2019s do the math: you pay 60% of the rent - $1,200. She pays 40% of the rent - $800, but also covers groceries - $547.80. That\u2019s $1347.80, not including the gas and other small things you mention her purchasing. You don\u2019t mention the breakdown of other expenses such as utilities, car insurance, etc. So this opinion is being expressed solely based on the inputs addressed above, but she may actually be contributing more than you financially and then you also expect her to handle all of the chores? I\u2019m curious how you define making significantly more than your partner when your idea of covering most of the rent is 10% more than an even split, but you often hear of couples splitting expenses proportionally to income and then home tasks / responsibilities being divided from there. \n\nSecondly, did you ever think that maybe she also wants to come home from work and relax and unwind? It\u2019s not like she\u2019s a part time employee or not working.

You are making her responsible not just for the cleaning but for the mental labor involved with all of this. You are an adult, you presumably have eyes and can see what needs to be done. You are capable of seeing that something needs to be done without waiting for her to assign it to you. And not knowing where the vacuum is? That\u2019s such a cop out. I suggest you look at the comic \u201cThe mental load\u201d and do some research on the mental load & weaponized incompetence. \n\nYou don\u2019t mention the breakdown of other responsibilities like cooking, who does the grocery shopping, etc. That could impact a lot of this judgment.

But the housework seems to me more like 5% (him) and 95% (her) sooooooooooo", "Yeah, they mean communication about feelings and whatnot... not being forced to act like your mother by telling you what you need to do to help around the household lmfao.", "Once a week was also an upgrade from once every other week \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "The way he\u2019s acting I thought he was paying all the rent and she was paying for expenses", "Agreed. He acts like she\u2019s a part time worker or stay at home wife, but really works as much as he does.", "It really doesn\u2019t. I\u2019d understand her taking on a bit more of the household chores, but nearly everything is ridiculous. But the split is 60/40.", "60/40 which is not \u2018majority split\u2019. Majority is 80/20 or 70/30. You don\u2019t split up chores with her doing almost all of them because you pay a few dollars more. He throws things in the washer/dryer and then does dishes but she does literally everything else and even then has to ask him to do his chores? Ok", "My mom is on my ass about being single as a 26 year old. I think it's because I've gone on a bunch of dates but apparently have high standards (like them not having a temper or cheating or being a misogynist lol).\n\nLike sorry, it's not worth digging through the men who don't contribute mentally or don't wash their butt to find one that is decent. \n\nI have books to fill my romance needs and I get by just fine without sex.", "This is how I feel, only because I lived with so many female roommates for years and have never had to dictate or demand them to clean up after themselves. Every partner I\u2019ve ever had (all male) live on their own just fine but seem to completely forget what clean or messy is, and how to pick up after themselves, as soon as they\u2019re staying at mine. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand.", "Goodness. If this kind of sentiment is getting support, then I've never been more glad to be gay. To hell with nuance indeed.", "That\u2019s sexist", "Oh right since women are a  protected class only you can make sweeping generalizations about us right ?", "And every woman wants their man to earn more than them work harder then them deal with the toxic workplaces but then also have 50 50 household lmao", "Apparently there are dudes who think wiping their own asses is gay. I wish I was kidding.", "Where does it say she agreed?", "10% more is not \u201cmost of the rent.\u201d", "you HAVE to be OP's alt account..", "And his gas", "Exactly! I\u2019m in CA so my concept of how far a dollar goes may be tainted lol but let\u2019s say their rent is $1,500, so he\u2019s paying $900 and she\u2019s paying the other $600. Again, this is going to depend on where they\u2019re located, but at least where I am it would be extremely challenging to feed 2 people for less than $300 a month. So odds are she definitely is paying over 50%.", "add in she was doing the majority of the cleaning *before* she took the pay cut and asked for a reduction", "It's amazing how the male mind works! They don't forget anything about a hundred other subjects, but chores are a total conundrum that can't be figured out!", "And...even if you *don't* know where the vacuum is, your house is a finite space and the vacuum cleaner is typically a larger item. Look for it. You'll find it. Probably in a logical spot.\n\nI found the vacuum cleaner at the Air BnB I was staying at. They didn't leave a note or anything. I just opened a closet and there it was!", "And she buys ALL the groceries!!!!\n\nFood is expensive as fuck right now.", "Oh wow, I missed that it's only a 10% difference. What a jerk.", "That got me too. He made is sound like he was paying a majority of the rent... no you weren't. Only 10% difference my ass.", "I feel like I had to scroll way too far down to find this. If they're doing a 60/40 split of the rent while they work the same hours then:\n\n1.) He's not paying \"most\" of the rent, he's paying slightly more than her (and proportional to his income)\n\n2.) They should be doing a 50/50 split of the chores (because time spent on chores should be proportional to time working not financial contribution), or a 60/40 split of chores if he wants a purely transactional relationship \n\n3.) He should be doing chores as he sees they need to be done, not putting the mental labor of chore-assignment on her.", "While I get his job takes more out of him this split isn't fair. He should at least have 40% of the chores to do in general. The days he works he could take on mostly less taxing chores. This will make tasks smaller in general and make his SO's tasks less taxing while also affording him less strain on days where he is more worn out from work. Like washing the dishes, taking the trash out, putting cloths away, vaccuming. He can act as supplemental support on work days at the minimum. Just add a few harder ones in there and add in him being responsible for most of the chores at least one weekend day. I'd say that would be a lot better and affords both of them an allowence for relaxing.", "Considering he mentioned \"washing\" the clothes (I'm guessing putting them in a machine) but not folding (the real work) my guess is he means loading the dishwasher.", "It's almost like there are universal, logical places for everyday items to be kept.", "Witchcraft!!", "We call it \u201clooking like a man\u201d in my circles. Some loveable idiots can stare at it and not see it smh", "Female clairvoyance!", "I envy you, I won\u2019t lie.", "They make me glad I decided 13 years ago I am better off single\ud83d\ude0a", "My husband is beyond a doubt just BAD at folding. Before we moved in, I used to laugh at the state of his wardrobe. I do all the laundry now.\n\nI went away for a week to help my mom with a move in another state and he did the laundry to surprise me and cleaned our whole place top to bottom. I\u2019m never gonna tell him that I refolded all the clothes lol, but the fact that he tried means a lot. And he cleaned everything else perfectly", "YEah I really wanted to ask how big an apartment they live in that he couldn't look and find it within 10 minutes.  When I was married we had a 2000 sqft home + walk up atic & basement and even if I didn't know where it was it wouldn't take me that long to find it", "And then her just asking in his presence becomes him providing her emotional support in his perspective!  So when she needs emotional support for an actual event, he is unable to cope. Holy hot diggity dog.", "Then let hire a professional that would evalue how valuable her work realy is. Before that you cant compare income of housekeeper to CEO on same hour rate", "How does your country define majority? Which country are you from?", "Amen to that.", "But it's okay, because men don't have any feelings.", "Oh no, you can't say that. Women are never wrong or entitled. Only the evil, icky, idiot men. /s", "So THIS is why the Christians think we are in the end times!", "They didn\u2019t, I misunderstood OPs comment about them agreeing on the chores. People gave me new info that I never saw in the comments from OP and after seeing that he\u2019s definitely an AH but I agree, they still definitely need to find a way to communicate with each-other to get the results they want from each other.", "It\u2019s never in anyone\u2019s booty hole. It\u2019s always in a logical place, unless someone has not returned it to a logical place or has dismantled it (an actual risk in my household - dismantling, not booty hole)", "Well obviously their apartment must be palatial with more closets than bedrooms. It's miraculous he can even locate the dirty dishes in the kitchen sink once a week or so. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/s", "And pays for his gas sometimes.", "Plus sometimes even his gas. Excuse me but wtf.", "10% - holy shit \n\nsomeone needs to slap this little boy's mama", "20%", "\ud83d\ude06", "Yeah I got a kick out of that comment, he does the laundry but she folds? So you threw some stuff in the washer then the dryer. Does that take a combined total of five minutes?", "I know, right?!", "They were clear about not working from home. \n\nI'm not sure why you keep saying incorrect things and then typing an essay worth of content after. \n\nSeems strange.", "By that logic he doesn't need to do chores cause she's got it covered lol. Couples income doesn't need to be equal but it's perfectly reasonable to want to account for splitting chores and bills so people unable to meet 50% of one can do a little more in the other. If she doesn't like that he isn't willing to do that she should leave and find someone who is, he isn't necessarily doing anything wrong they just have different expectations for providing a home. And this is coming from a dude who does all the housework while studying + working 60 hrs / week cause I can only contribute around 30% to bills. Fair is fair", "Oh no they might kick me off Reddit !", "I'm not sure why an adult needs to be told that keeping your home clean is an expectation of the relationship since it's an expectation of being an adult.  Having your own home means if something is dirty, you clean it, and if you are constantly leaving a mess for someone you supposedly love, to clean up, they are not going to stick around. \n\nI know when I need to clean up, my bf does not have to tell me what needs cleaned, even WITH ADHD I'm keenly aware of the mess that I need to take care of. I know when the doom piles are too much, I know when there are dishes in the sink I need to do them, I know when my kids leave a mess I need to pick it up. My bf does not need to make this a condition of our relationship because I'm an able bodied adult.", "While I agree with the general principle that good communication is key in any relationship, it seems like OP is deliberately taking advantage of his gf in this case. It\u2019s very convenient to pull the \u201cbut you didn\u2019t ask me for help!\u201d card, isn\u2019t it? It automatically puts her in the bad communicator\u2019s territory. When in reality keeping a mutual living space clean and doing your fair share is common sense. Not treating your partner as a maid is also common sense. But instead he assumed that since she earns less, cleaning should be her night job after her full time job while he rests, because he (again) assumed that she has a less demanding job and thus has no business being tired and asking him for \u201chelp\u201d. I doesn\u2019t take a medium to \u201cmind-read\u201d that your partner shouldn\u2019t be the one cleaning all the damn time while you lie around after work. He\u2019s being deliberately dense by pretending that he doesn\u2019t know how to find the vacuum cleaner. This is not a miscommunication, this is him being an AH.\n\n\nETA: I can\u2019t even agree with the term \u201chelp\u201d. Keeping your own living space clean is not helping.", "It\u2019s not helping, he lives there, he makes messes. He\u2019s not helping when he does the most basic work to care for his own living space.", "Well, you did comment that they agreed MANY times... people are just responding to your comments as they come across them.", "And it sounds like she's communicating that he needs to start doing his share as a responsible adult in his own home and he's trying to find away to get out of that, while also expecting her to micro manage his contribution to their shared responsibilities.", "And his daddy too.", "I\u2019m not sure why you read one sentence then stop. He\u2019s not doing 40% of the household labor. Better?", "I totally agree with you. There was some info I didn\u2019t see in the comments that others have pointed out. OP is/was definitely being a major AH for that.", "You\u2019re responding to every single one with the same thing. Find something new to say maybe? Or maybe give new info that I may have not had that will change my mind like others have done?", "Also, if you hadn't literally made the exact same comment on other people's comments the responses would seem less redundant.", "You literally copy and pasted your response like 4 different times. If there was something of value in your responses itd he different but there wasn\u2019t. Either give new info that could help someone\u2019s judgement or just stfu."]}
