{"id": 13006, "submission_id": "11zr0gz", "title": "AITA for letting my girlfriend do most of the household chores because she doesn\u2019t pay as much of the rent as I do?", "selftext": "I (24M) work for a very prominent company and get paid a lot better than my girlfriend (23F). We both moved to a different state for my job, and she ended up with a very toxic work environment with a boss who was sexist and homophobic. She hated her job and ended up getting a new one that pays a lot less than her old one, and has asked me to take on the responsibility of paying most of the rent. \n\nSince we have been in this new state, she has done most of the cleaning. I contribute by doing the dishes sometimes and washing the laundry (she folds it). She is the only one who cleans the bathroom, the kitchen, and the only one who sweeps, mops, and vacuums along with other random chores here and there. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 8 months since we moved and everything was fine until recently. The other day she asked me to vacuum the living room and I said I didn\u2019t know where the vacuum was. Since then, she keeps bringing up how I need to do more of the housework, but I feel like because I contribute more to the rent she should be responsible for keeping the apartment clean. I also do the dishes sometimes and do stuff she asks me to do. \n\nI\u2019ve done more of the dishes since she brought it up (doing them maybe once a week instead of once every other week). She now leaves cleaning tasks for me to do without telling me about them and then gets upset when they aren\u2019t done. If she just asked me to clean those parts of the apartment then I would. She claims that I should know what needs to get done and just do them myself without making her bring it up first. Eventually she gets frustrated and just cleans by herself.\n\nI\u2019m also tired from working when I get home and I just want to relax or finish my work. She works the same amount of hours as me, but her job is much less demanding than mine so she is less drained by the end of the day. She does pay for our groceries and my gas sometimes as well as other little things here and there. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole for expecting her to contribute with the housework since I contribute more financially. AITA for letting her do most of cleaning since I pay for most of the rent?\n\nEdit: I just want to answer some of the more common questions I\u2019ve been seeing. We both work the same amount of hours each week. She has agreed that her job is less demanding than mine. We split the rent 60/40 so I pay about 60% of it right now. Her health concerns aren\u2019t an every day thing, but they come up a few times a month. I know where the vacuum is now. After receiving the comments I have, I really need to sit and reflect on how I am acting in this relationship. I recognize now that I have truly and deeply made a mistake with thinking paying more of the rent means that I should do less of the housework. I really love her and I value her so much, and I\u2019ve clearly done a horrible job at showing that.\n\nUpdate: I appreciate those of you defending me in the comments, but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I am the asshole. Please don\u2019t say anything negative about my girlfriend since she has not done anything wrong. She\u2019s tried talking to me about this and I have not been receptive. I\u2019m sorry for not responding to people, I was having a conversation with her. There\u2019s nothing I can do to make up for the past 8 months, and I was an idiot to think that my financial contribution was great enough to warrant not doing any chores. I would do anything to keep her, and I messed up thinking that this was a small issue. I hope she forgives me for not taking her concerns seriously, and I hope I can create an environment where she feels comfortable confronting me in the future if I\u2019m EVER acting like this again. It shouldn\u2019t have come down to strangers on the internet telling me I\u2019m an asshole to realize this, but thank you all for the wake up call so much. I am never going to dismiss her or all the hard work she puts into this relationship and our life together again. Im going to start doing the majority of the chores for the time being. I\u2019m also going to start paying more of the rent since I do make more. I don\u2019t pay more of the rent to have a housekeeper, I pay more of the rent because I love her and I want to support her.

We both moved to a different state for my job, and she ended up with a very toxic work environment with a boss who was sexist and homophobic. She hated her job and ended up getting a new one that pays a lot less than her old one, and has asked me to take on the responsibility of paying most of the rent. \n\nSince we have been in this new state, she has done most of the cleaning. I contribute by doing the dishes sometimes and washing the laundry (she folds it). She is the only one who cleans the bathroom, the kitchen, and the only one who sweeps, mops, and vacuums along with other random chores here and there. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 8 months since we moved and everything was fine until recently. The other day she asked me to vacuum the living room and I said I didn\u2019t know where the vacuum was. Since then, she keeps bringing up how I need to do more of the housework, but I feel like because I contribute more to the rent she should be responsible for keeping the apartment clean. I also do the dishes sometimes and do stuff she asks me to do. \n\nI\u2019ve done more of the dishes since she brought it up (doing them maybe once a week instead of once every other week). She now leaves cleaning tasks for me to do without telling me about them and then gets upset when they aren\u2019t done. If she just asked me to clean those parts of the apartment then I would. She claims that I should know what needs to get done and just do them myself without making her bring it up first. Eventually she gets frustrated and just cleans by herself.\n\nI\u2019m also tired from working when I get home and I just want to relax or finish my work. She works the same amount of hours as me, but her job is much less demanding than mine so she is less drained by the end of the day. She does pay for our groceries and my gas sometimes as well as other little things here and there. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole for expecting her to contribute with the housework since I contribute more financially. AITA for letting her do most of cleaning since I pay for most of the rent?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re expecting her to do all the cleaning, laundry, etc every week? On top of working the same hours as you?

My husband is typically working 6 months off 6 months while I work full time year round. In his off time he definitely takes on the bulk of the chores (cooking, cleaning etc) BUT it isn't the expectation or requirement that he do everything domestic while I earn the money. I still help out with things on weekends or if I leave late/get home early.  When we are both working full time we split a lot more evenly because regardless of income/labour effort at work we are out of the house the same amount of time. \n\nI'll vote YTA but a redeemable one.  Just start doing the chores together, it'll cut the time and effort it takes and you spend time with each other.", "YTA.", "YTA Just hire a cleaner to come every week or month.

I work at a big company and just hire a cleaner because I\u2019m disabled.", "Yes, YTA - You guy work the same hours and salary is not a god damned contest- the highest doesn't win and get a prize. \n\nThe fact you wouldn't simply help you GF simply because she needs help shows how much of TA you are. If my wife asks for help I am there to back her up no matter what. If she is feeling overwhelmed? I will take something off her shoulders to help her out. Kids are rambunctious? I will take them out and give her a break. And this is ON TOP OF us already splitting things 50/50. \n\nIf you don't even know where the vacuum is because that's how little you help out then yes you have a problem, but it's not with your GF- it's with you. You are the problem. \n\nLook up the term \"weaponized incompetence\" because that's what you are doing and if you keep it up you will find yourself single again.", "YTA. \n\nFirst, you assume that she should do most of the household chores because you pay more, not because you two discussed this and agreed to it. You don't get to unilaterally decide the fair/right split of chores on your own. \n\nSecond, you aren't \"letting her\" do the cleaning, it isn't a favor you are doing for her. \n\nMy personal belief is that chores should be split by work hours, not income. So if I make more than my partner but I work from home so have less commute time, or work less hours, then I do more of the stuff at home. Chores should be about what is practical- if I drive past a grocery store on the way home, I grab groceries, if my partner is home earlier, he starts dinner, I start a load of laundry on my way out, he goes to work later so puts it in the dryer.\n\n The only way how much each person pays should factor in is if there is an explicit agreement- hey I cannot pay as much as you, so how about I do X, Y, Z instead. You didn't do that. The conversation was about you picking up more bills so she could change jobs, which is a fine conversation, and you are showing up as a good partner by understanding that this is a moment for you to step up for her as she makes a change in life that is good for her, and therefore good for you both. \n\nBut you decided that this meant you could do so little around the home that you can't even FIND the vacuum. You only do the dishes sometimes and when ASKED to help. This idea that because you pay more she should be in charge of the home is a toxic attitude about servitude instead of partnership.", "YTA.  If you think it's unfair that you pay more of the rent because she can no longer afford half, then find another home to rent that she CAN afford.  But don't forget about the reasons why she can't.  She moved to another state because YOU found a new job and wanted to move.  It's hard to land a good job in a new place without the networking and connections she may have enjoyed so she has a lot less flexibility and opportunity because she made a change that benefitted you.    ANd she didn't quit her first job in the new town simply because she didn't like it, she left because the boss was likely engaging in ILLEGAL WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR.  That's a little more serious than \"OMG, my job is so, like, toxic, I can't even.\"  \n\nWhatever financial arrangement you make for the bills, the housekeeping has to be equally shared, because you both contribute to making a mess and it's only fair to both clean it up.  But if you must keep a ledger book and count the pennies, don't forget to factor in the major \"down payment\" she made by quitting her job, uprooting her home, and moving to another state for YOU.

Don't just assume that she should do more based on your internal rational. Discuss these things in advance.\n3) This may sound like it contradicts above, but you shouldn't have to be told all the time to help out. If you have working eyes you can see when the shower needs scrubbed, the dishes need done, the laundry needs to be put away, etc. It's completely irritating to have to ask a partner all the time to do basic daily tasks. Women want an equal partner, not an extra child they have to hound to do the chores. If that means having some sort of pre-discussed division of labor that's fine, but you shouldn't have to be told everytime something needs done around the house.\n4) In general, your post indicates a lack of respect for your partner and a sense of importance/entitlement about yourself. Be more supportive and considerate. Realize and appreciate what your partner brings to the table even if she earns less. Put yourself in someone else's shoes.

You also say she pays for all of the groceries. You don\u2019t mention the area you live (country, high vs. low cost of living area), so I\u2019m going to make some assumptions here: according to a quick google search, the national median cost of rent in the US is $1,937 (rent.com, not too sure on validity of that number but we\u2019ll roll with it). Let\u2019s round up to make it an even $2,000 so it divides well. Additionally, the USDA says the average THRIFTY monthly cost of groceries in February 2023 for a woman aged 20-50 is $243.50, and for a man the same age range is $304.40. So let\u2019s do the math: you pay 60% of the rent - $1,200. She pays 40% of the rent - $800, but also covers groceries - $547.80. That\u2019s $1347.80, not including the gas and other small things you mention her purchasing. You don\u2019t mention the breakdown of other expenses such as utilities, car insurance, etc. So this opinion is being expressed solely based on the inputs addressed above, but she may actually be contributing more than you financially and then you also expect her to handle all of the chores? I\u2019m curious how you define making significantly more than your partner when your idea of covering most of the rent is 10% more than an even split, but you often hear of couples splitting expenses proportionally to income and then home tasks / responsibilities being divided from there. \n\nSecondly, did you ever think that maybe she also wants to come home from work and relax and unwind? It\u2019s not like she\u2019s a part time employee or not working.

You are making her responsible not just for the cleaning but for the mental labor involved with all of this. You are an adult, you presumably have eyes and can see what needs to be done. You are capable of seeing that something needs to be done without waiting for her to assign it to you. And not knowing where the vacuum is? That\u2019s such a cop out. I suggest you look at the comic \u201cThe mental load\u201d and do some research on the mental load & weaponized incompetence. \n\nYou don\u2019t mention the breakdown of other responsibilities like cooking, who does the grocery shopping, etc. That could impact a lot of this judgment.

It really hammers home a lot of the unspoken assumptions even well-meaning guys (and it's almost always guys) have that lead them to dump a lot on their partners.", "Constructive incompetence; he thinks if he does a crappy job or claims not to know how, he\u2019ll get away with being a lazy jerk.", "I've seen a few people bring this up so I wanted to mention it directly, but you pay 60% rent, but can you honestly say you do 40% of housework.\n\nIf you think you do, list out all the housework you do in a week and how often you do it in a week. Then ask your girlfriend to do the same. Compare lists. There might be things she does daily on her list that you wouldn't even think to do (and vice versa).\n\nAlso she works the same hours as you, and although it's not as demanding, per both your words and hers based on your post, you mentioned she has health concerns. This might mean that even if the concern or condition flairs up occasionally, those occasions might mean that her day is significantly more demanding (either through pain, needing to track pain management or medications, or just powering through and dealing with the stress of the health condition) than yours. Also if it's something chronic, she might minimise the issue, because she doesn't want it to be a big deal, affect the way you treat her, or even minimise it for herself because she wants to still feel independent, or not use it as an excuse or a whole variety of other reasons. Some days may simply be harder on her than others, and a supportive partner will pick up the slack - ideally without being asked or needing to be provided with a list.\n\nAlso, with current inflation, that 10% rent different will not be nearly ask much of a difference as you think since she buys groceries. Let's say your rent is $2000 pcm, well 50% would be $1000, and 10% = $200. I only pay for me and my bill is $50 a week (\u00a340 but I converted it), give or take, so her buying for both of you plus your gas/petrol, means that she probably spends more than the $200 she \"saves\" and the split is probably more like she pays 51% while you pay 49% (this will vary depending on how bills are split, I'm assuming equally).\n\nOn that note, it's okay to ask once or twice, but you need to listen and remember the stuff you're told. Imagine how frustrated you'd get if you constantly and daily needed to ask your partner to brush her teeth, showed her how each day, and then the next day, she'd ask you all over again. It's a task she should know, understand the importance of, and should have learnt how to manage independently by now. The same applies to cleaning and maintaining a house. So ask, but do what you can to remember what's a regular task and what's an occasional task. Alternatively, ask if there's anything specific she wants you to clean - if so, do specific and a general clean, and if not, do a general clean (vacuum, dishes, wipe surfaces, make bed, if there's laundry do it). Honestly, I have trouble remembering everything that needs doing in a house, but there's charts online - maybe print one out and take a look. Some break it down into daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal tasks, which might help you keep track of the big Vs little tasks.\n\nShe also moved with you for you. She's probably further away from friends and family now so she's lost her social and support networks. That can be hard and mentally draining in its own way, so maybe keep an eye on that. While it's not a financial cost, she has sacrificed something for you - she's sacrificed a sense of familiarity in her surroundings, which in turn is a sacrifice of a certain amount of security. Hopefully this isn't so much of a thing if she's settled into a new place and built new networks, but she's already paid an pretty high, though intangible, amount for you both to live together. I'm not saying you should keep score of who owes what, but do keep in mind that some things done for a relationship have a high value but a low financial cost.\n\nBased on your edits, I think you do understand and do feel remorseful, but I just wanted to summarise some other commenters really excellent points, and add a few of my own.", "That\u2019s honestly super refreshing and nice to hear!", " It really seems like you want to take on more of the mental/emotional labour of running a home.
