We both moved to a different state for my job, and she ended up with a very toxic work environment with a boss who was sexist and homophobic. She hated her job and ended up getting a new one that pays a lot less than her old one, and has asked me to take on the responsibility of paying most of the rent. \n\nSince we have been in this new state, she has done most of the cleaning. I contribute by doing the dishes sometimes and washing the laundry (she folds it). She is the only one who cleans the bathroom, the kitchen, and the only one who sweeps, mops, and vacuums along with other random chores here and there. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 8 months since we moved and everything was fine until recently. The other day she asked me to vacuum the living room and I said I didn\u2019t know where the vacuum was. Since then, she keeps bringing up how I need to do more of the housework, but I feel like because I contribute more to the rent she should be responsible for keeping the apartment clean. I also do the dishes sometimes and do stuff she asks me to do. \n\nI\u2019ve done more of the dishes since she brought it up (doing them maybe once a week instead of once every other week). She now leaves cleaning tasks for me to do without telling me about them and then gets upset when they aren\u2019t done. If she just asked me to clean those parts of the apartment then I would. She claims that I should know what needs to get done and just do them myself without making her bring it up first. Eventually she gets frustrated and just cleans by herself.\n\nI\u2019m also tired from working when I get home and I just want to relax or finish my work. She works the same amount of hours as me, but her job is much less demanding than mine so she is less drained by the end of the day. She does pay for our groceries and my gas sometimes as well as other little things here and there. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole for expecting her to contribute with the housework since I contribute more financially. AITA for letting her do most of cleaning since I pay for most of the rent?\n\nEdit: I just want to answer some of the more common questions I\u2019ve been seeing. We both work the same amount of hours each week. She has agreed that her job is less demanding than mine. We split the rent 60/40 so I pay about 60% of it right now. Her health concerns aren\u2019t an every day thing, but they come up a few times a month. I know where the vacuum is now. After receiving the comments I have, I really need to sit and reflect on how I am acting in this relationship. I recognize now that I have truly and deeply made a mistake with thinking paying more of the rent means that I should do less of the housework. I really love her and I value her so much, and I\u2019ve clearly done a horrible job at showing that.", "created_utc": 1679592029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zr0gz/aita_for_letting_my_girlfriend_do_most_of_the/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She hated her job and ended up getting a new one that pays a lot less than her old one, and has asked me to take on the responsibility of paying most of the rent. \n\nSince we have been in this new state, she has done most of the cleaning. I contribute by doing the dishes sometimes and washing the laundry (she folds it). She is the only one who cleans the bathroom, the kitchen, and the only one who sweeps, mops, and vacuums along with other random chores here and there. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 8 months since we moved and everything was fine until recently. The other day she asked me to vacuum the living room and I said I didn\u2019t know where the vacuum was. Since then, she keeps bringing up how I need to do more of the housework, but I feel like because I contribute more to the rent she should be responsible for keeping the apartment clean. I also do the dishes sometimes and do stuff she asks me to do. \n\nI\u2019ve done more of the dishes since she brought it up (doing them maybe once a week instead of once every other week). She now leaves cleaning tasks for me to do without telling me about them and then gets upset when they aren\u2019t done. If she just asked me to clean those parts of the apartment then I would. She claims that I should know what needs to get done and just do them myself without making her bring it up first. Eventually she gets frustrated and just cleans by herself.\n\nI\u2019m also tired from working when I get home and I just want to relax or finish my work. She works the same amount of hours as me, but her job is much less demanding than mine so she is less drained by the end of the day. She does pay for our groceries and my gas sometimes as well as other little things here and there. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole for expecting her to contribute with the housework since I contribute more financially. AITA for letting her do most of cleaning since I pay for most of the rent?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Just like that other person a few days ago that thought money equals chores. It doesn't, time does. If you work the same amount of hours, you do the same amount of chores.

Your GF is absolutely correct that you should know what needs to be done without her telling you; and she shouldn\u2019t have to be the one to initiate the conversation or assign the tasks. She\u2019s supposed to be your partner not your caretaker/parent. \n\nYou\u2019re also the AH for linking wages to household importance. It gives the impression that because you make more money than your girlfriend, then you\u2019re somehow more important than her and somehow above menial tasks like housework. \n\nIt\u2019s probably good that you make more money because then you can hire a housekeeper when she finally gets fed up with your antiquated relationship ideologies; and from what you\u2019ve said she\u2019d like you to do, it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s asking for the 50/50 split she should, which is far more accommodating than is deserved.", "YTA - I make way more than my partner.

If you can't contribut to the rent equally and you won't split by income but still want to live with your partner, you move to a cheaper flat, period. \n\nDemanding your partner sacrifices a big part of their free time to do all the chores so you can sit on your lazy ass is textbook definition of an asshole. \n\nYou don't care about her.

Your pay doesn\u2019t exclude you from having to take care of yourself. If you want a maid, hire a maid.

The amount of money that you each make does not matter because that has nothing to do with how you maintain where you live.\n\n>She works the same amount of hours as me, but her job is much less demanding than mine so she is less drained by the end of the day. \n\nIf you are both in the home for equal amounts because you work the same hours then you divide the chores equally. You do not have a right to expect her to do more than you. If you discuss it you may both agree to a different arrangement but that is not what it sounds like here. \n\nYTA", "Wow Yta. It\u2019s one thing for her to do the bulk of the cleaning. But you doing dishes once a week or every other week is not a contribution!\n\nYou live there, yes? You eat and sleep and shower there?

YTA", "YTA but also with a hint of ESH for the passive-aggressive games y\u2019all are both playing. \n\nYou live there, you should be contributing to maintaining the household. Sure you pay more money, but if the money is there, that\u2019s the easiest part of keeping up with your home. You work the same hours and her and spend what, 5 mins each month actually paying the rent? Or no time at all if you\u2019re using autopay. You\u2019re expecting her to do all the cleaning, laundry, etc every week? On top of working the same hours as you? All of those chores take a lot of time to get done. \n\nMore importantly, you guys are adults. You need to TALK TO EACH OTHER with instead of expecting that you\u2019re going to read each other\u2019s minds.

Your attitude is antiquated and speaks to your character.", "YTA. I have this exact division of labor with my fianc\u00e9. He pays more of our bills and does our outside work, and I do most of our cleaning/cooking. We both work full time. The difference is I work from home, and we agreed to this division when we moved in together. I just don\u2019t understand how two grown people don\u2019t have these conversations before living with one another.", "YTA \n\nThe average yearly salary for a live-in housekeeper is around $25,000 (US). \n\nIf you don\u2019t want the responsibility of being a normal, functioning human who cleans up after themselves, then why don\u2019t you stop putting it on your girlfriend and just hire someone so you can have every right to treat them transactionally?", "I understand some of the thought process here. My husband is typically working 6 months off 6 months while I work full time year round. In his off time he definitely takes on the bulk of the chores (cooking, cleaning etc) BUT it isn't the expectation or requirement that he do everything domestic while I earn the money. I still help out with things on weekends or if I leave late/get home early.  When we are both working full time we split a lot more evenly because regardless of income/labour effort at work we are out of the house the same amount of time. \n\nI'll vote YTA but a redeemable one.  Just start doing the chores together, it'll cut the time and effort it takes and you spend time with each other.", "YTA.", "YTA Just hire a cleaner to come every week or month. Let them detail clean and you can just maintain. I work at a big company and just hire a cleaner because I\u2019m disabled.", "Yes, YTA - You guy work the same hours and salary is not a god damned contest- the highest doesn't win and get a prize. \n\nThe fact you wouldn't simply help you GF simply because she needs help shows how much of TA you are. If my wife asks for help I am there to back her up no matter what. If she is feeling overwhelmed? I will take something off her shoulders to help her out. Kids are rambunctious? I will take them out and give her a break. And this is ON TOP OF us already splitting things 50/50. \n\nIf you don't even know where the vacuum is because that's how little you help out then yes you have a problem, but it's not with your GF- it's with you. You are the problem. \n\nLook up the term \"weaponized incompetence\" because that's what you are doing and if you keep it up you will find yourself single again.", "YTA. \n\nFirst, you assume that she should do most of the household chores because you pay more, not because you two discussed this and agreed to it. You don't get to unilaterally decide the fair/right split of chores on your own. \n\nSecond, you aren't \"letting her\" do the cleaning, it isn't a favor you are doing for her. \n\nMy personal belief is that chores should be split by work hours, not income. So if I make more than my partner but I work from home so have less commute time, or work less hours, then I do more of the stuff at home. Chores should be about what is practical- if I drive past a grocery store on the way home, I grab groceries, if my partner is home earlier, he starts dinner, I start a load of laundry on my way out, he goes to work later so puts it in the dryer.\n\n The only way how much each person pays should factor in is if there is an explicit agreement- hey I cannot pay as much as you, so how about I do X, Y, Z instead. You didn't do that. The conversation was about you picking up more bills so she could change jobs, which is a fine conversation, and you are showing up as a good partner by understanding that this is a moment for you to step up for her as she makes a change in life that is good for her, and therefore good for you both. \n\nBut you decided that this meant you could do so little around the home that you can't even FIND the vacuum. You only do the dishes sometimes and when ASKED to help. This idea that because you pay more she should be in charge of the home is a toxic attitude about servitude instead of partnership.", "YTA.  If you think it's unfair that you pay more of the rent because she can no longer afford half, then find another home to rent that she CAN afford.  But think about the reasons why she can't afford it.  She moved to another state because YOU found a new job and wanted to move.  She didn't quit her first job in the new town simply because she didn't like it, she left because", "YTA\n\nShe's not your maid. Her time is valuable too and you both live in that house.\n\nBe a partner to your girlfriend not just some lazy roommate.", "YTA\n\nShe had a sexist boss and now she has you. I hope her next BF is less toxic.", "NTA.\n\nYou're subsidizing her life by paying rent for her. It absolutely makes sense for her to repay that by doing more of the chores.", "Yikes. YTA, very very much so. You make more money and do less than what sounds like an hrs worth of work every week?! You make more so she's your maid and cook? Grow up.", "YTA 100,000% \n\nShe works just as much as you and is just as mentally and physically drained. Ugh i wanna shake you for being such an AH", "Dude, I live with my mom and unlike most sons/daughters that live at home. I take it upon myself to try to do the dishes, trash, and feed the animals everyday. I also try to make it a point to check the mail and bring it in for us. This is despite the fact that I pay half the bills and had to cover most if not all emergency expenses that came up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefinitely YTA, you dont have to move mountains. Just pick the same chores, doing the dishes and taking out the trash wont kill you.", "A lot of people are pointing out you two working the same amount of hours as a huge factor, but beyond that, if your partner is asking you to contribute to housework that has ZERO to do with who works more hours or gets paid more. \n\nIf anything, it's the opposite, since you cannot put a dollar amount on a kept home. Since you both live there, it's both of your responsibilities in less you two have communicated otherwise. And it sounds like she's not on board with being in charge of majority of the cleaning. YTA", "YTA. I make more than my husband and so contribute more to the bills, but we work the same hours so we do roughly the same amount of chores.", "YTA - do you realise how entitled you sound. \u201cI make more money than you working the same amount of hours so you have to do the majority of the housework.\u201d Does that not sound embarrassing to you??? God forbid you ever have children\u2026", "Yta.   By your reasoning you\u2019re effectively hiring your gf as a maid.", "NTA but it's time to split everything financially 50/50 regardless of how much more you make.", "YTA. Weaponized incompetence is such a turnoff. I bet you\u2019re not getting as much as you used to while she\u2019s doing all these chores.", "As some one who pays a larger proportion of the bills than my partner and doesn't do their fair share of chores, I can safely say, yes. YTA (and so am I).", "YTA. Do you both work full time? Or closely similar hours? Then you both need to make similar contributions in time and effort to house work. It's not about how much you pay toward rent", "Why does this always have to be an issue? Shouldn't matter who makes more and whose job is more labor-intensive. A relationship is not a competition. Help her out for God's sake. Nobody wants to do chores and everyone is tired and wants to relax. Her included. \n\nYTA.", "Sorry, either your additional income pays for a cleaner, or you contribute more time. \n\nEach of you work full time, so your time off work instantly becomes your own, hers just shifts to her second job,  your servant. That can work if that's what you've agreed to, but it seems she doesn't agree. You moved for your job, which defined the jobs she can get. \n\nIf this isn't something you two can reach a deal that fits you both, you're relationship is done. YTA.", "YTA. Make an actual budget of expenses. I guarantee you\u2019re not paying THAT much extra if she\u2019s paying for groceries and gas. Certainly not enough for her to be your maid. Your idea of \u201chelping\u201d isn\u2019t helping. The dishes once a week? Throwing clothes in the wash? You are out of your mind. Your girlfriend would also like to relax after work. And news flash she\u2019s making less than you because of a move she made for YOU and your career. Shape up or she\u2019ll wise up and leave you.", "YTA.  You work the same hours. Would be different if it was part time.  It also just sounds like she wants some help, not a 50/50 split, even though that's what it should be.  Just help if she asks for help and don't look down on her just because she gets paid less than you.", "Funny.", "Yes YTA and a lazy one. \n\nChores are split by workload not income! \nRent/bills should be split by income ratio.\n\nDo you say to her when she ask you to contribute more rent that she would especially be your maid then?", "Do you work a lot more hours than her? She moved for you. She is probably just as exhausted from work. The fact that you make more so you pay more of the rent doesn\u2019t mean anything. She\u2019s not your manager. She\u2019s not your mother. It\u2019s not on her to tell you what needs done around the house.

Not only is your income NOT an excuse for you to not take part in the house hold chores, your girlfriend is actively struggling to keep up with them because of her health issues and you think that it's okay to just ignore it until she's feeling well enough to do them herself. You said you're tired when you get home from work and just want to relax but have you ever stopped to think that maybe she wants to relax too since, you know, SHE'S STRUGGLING WITH HEALTH ISSUES?\n\nYou need to pick up the slack and take on more house work and stop expecting your girlfriend to do all the work to keep the house running.

She works the same hours as you, even if her pay is less. You expect her to do almost the entirety of another job on top of that?

Don't just assume that she should do more based on your internal rational. Discuss these things in advance.\n3) This may sound like it contradicts above, but you shouldn't have to be told all the time to help out. If you have working eyes you can see when the shower needs scrubbed, the dishes need done, the laundry needs to be put away, etc. It's completely irritating to have to ask a partner all the time to do basic daily tasks. Women want an equal partner, not an extra child they have to hound to do the chores. If that means having some sort of pre-discussed division of labor that's fine, but you shouldn't have to be told everytime something needs done around the house.\n4) In general, your post indicates a lack of respect for your partner and a sense of importance/entitlement about yourself.
