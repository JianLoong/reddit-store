I've talked to him about it before and asked if he could stop, but that's just how he is I guess. \n\nRecently, it was his birthday. My mom had organized a party and a lot of the extended family was there. It was the first time in a long time that we all got together so we were all excited for it. \n\nWell, we're sitting down to eat a delicious meal my mom cooked, and my dad speaks up and says something along the lines of \"have you heard about that corrupt politician who did x?\" \n\nBefore anyone can say anything, I speak up and say \"speaking of that...\" and tell a loosely connected, funny anecdote from work. Everyone laughs, and continues talking about random things. \n\nDuring the entire dinner, whenever my dad starts speaking up about something depressing, I interrupt or steer the conversation away. \n\nAfter the dinner, when everyone's gone home, my dad tells me he knows what I was doing and that I'm an AH. I say no one wants to hear that depressing stuff during a celebration, but he maintains that it's normal dinner conversation. \n\nMy mom understands why I did what I did, but thinks it was an ah move to do it during his birthday dinner when we were supposed to celebrate him. I don't think it being your birthday justifies making everyone else uncomfortable, but I can see her point.

So I know I'm not the only one who is bothered by it.\n\nETA 2: it's not the topics themselves that are the problem. I can enjoy discussing politics, the climate or finance too. It's that my dad will just rant about how all politicians are corrupt and how the world is getting worse in every single way.

To be so obstinate in your dismissal of topics your dad find important to talk about with his family (at his birthday celebration no less) is not only very rude but incredibly tone deaf of the state of the world right now. \n\nI am operating under the assumption you live in the US, but the above is true even if that is not the case.
