I think therapy can help most people and it could probably help you guys - not necessarily by uncovering some kind of weight related trauma but by helping you be better communicators. What happened just demonstrates that you guys don't have a good road map for handling conflict. Weight is a very fraught issue and a therapist could help you guys communicate about what you both want.", "I don't understand how couples therapy is gonna help you both with your individual weight issues but ok. And I say that as a couples therapist.  \n\nAnother thing I say as a couples therapist: it's shitty to storm out of session for safety purposes. I've had clients do the same thing and then it's this whole thing where I've gotta call you and the cops to make sure you're not tryna do anything permanent. Not cool. \n\nSomething I say as a regular person is, YTA. Therapy means you sit in your feelings and experience them. Communicate with her that you felt blamed. Storming out is immature and won't get you anywhere.", "YTA. The entire point of therapy is to get to the root issues of things like this. Y'all are just starting, so you're just finding out how the each of you view your situation. Storming out isn't going to solve those issues; sticking it out hopefully will.", "ESH and babies don\u2019t make things better!", "YTA therapy was the best place for this conversation to take place. You got mad and left instead of having a civil discussion with the therapist as a mediator if needed. Call the therapist and try to reschedule quickly and don\u2019t leave during the appointment as it looks like you don\u2019t care about your gf.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have blamed you for her weight. You shouldn\u2019t have stormed out. Y\u2019all need the therapy or at least a series of conversations about this where you hear each others feelings without exploding into a shouting match.", "YTA. She was trying to open up to the therapist about what she believes has been a key factor in her weight gain, and you not only invalidated her but you immaturely stormed out of a therapy session that someone was generous enough to pay for so you two can figure it out. \n\nTake some accountability. Perhaps she needs to as well. I'm sure it's not all on you OP, but you two most likely enable each other.", ">her parents decided to buy us a couple therapy session to discuss these issues and see if there are any underlying psychological problems contributing to it\n\nThat's a really terrible reason to go into therapy and sets the encounter up for failure. Which is what happened. If you need therapy, or couples therapy, by all means do therapy. But a 1 session gift of therapy? What did you really expect to happen? That you'd be cured in 50 minutes?\n\nESH.", "ESH you for yelling. Her for blaming you rather than taking responsibility for her own choices. The therapist for not redirecting your gf immediately when she tried to assign blame and then letting it escalate.\n\nYou were probably right to leave. You both need individual therapy before couples.", "YTA - She needs to be able to say her piece, without judgement, regardless of if you agree with it or not.  Storming out solves nothing and probably sets back progress.", "ERGH this is kind of tough and I would need to know how the actual argument went down to really know, but I\u2019d say NTA/ESH. But you need to continue to work through this with a professional. \n\nWeight gain for your gf sounds like it might be impacting her a bit differently. It sounds like you are very matter-of-fact about it, but for some people, weight gain can draw up a huge amount of emotions. Denial and blame can definitely come into the equation as a means to protect oneself. I imagine that is at least partially what your gf was doing, protecting herself by deflecting to you. \n\nAs another commentator has said, therapy is an ongoing, lengthy process. I really wish this had been a better experience for you, and I don\u2019t want you to get the idea that therapy will be this way for you in the future. It can be a very healing process, provided it\u2019s done right. With that in mind, I would suggest you and your gf find individual therapists first. You will each have a private and safe space where you can say exactly what is on your mind without damaging your relationship. The therapist can help guide you in methods of then communicating your needs/wants/concerns to your gf in a way that is productive and healthy. \n\nI am concerned the couples therapist let the argument escalate so much, they should have done better to prevent the shouting so you didn\u2019t feel so overwhelmed.", "YTA. Therapy isn\u2019t meant to be easy or comfortable. Storming out makes it seem like you don\u2019t care to hear your GFs POV.", "ESH. The thing to remember in therapy is that when your partner says something that you feel angry or hurt or betrayed, you learn to say \u201cI feel betrayed \u201c or \u201cI disagree \u201c or even turn to the therapist and say \u201cI don\u2019t know how to respond to this without freaking out.

Have you made any effort to get your weight and diabetes under control as a couple?", "ESH. It sounds like you guys really need couples therapy AND individual therapy. You\u2019re enabling EACH OTHER. You\u2019re very complacent about both of your weights and have a whatever it is what it is attitude. You two should NOT be considering bringing a baby into this equation right now.", "ESH. Yes, it sounds like you got blindsided if it\u2019s never been brought up before but at the same time. That\u2019s the exact place to sort it out and instead of working with her and the therapist you left.", "YTA.  Storming out of therapy won't fix anything.  The whole point is to sit there and work through the problems.  It's a process but you've both got to be willing to get through it.", "I had a Horrible experience with couple's therapy.  It's not a perfect magic bullet.  NAH.", "YTA and I think the therapist isalso a little bit TA for letting the discussion get so out of hand.

However, since you did go, storming out while your GF opens up about you being \\*one\\* of the factors that have contributed to her weight gain, is selfish.

She needs to be able to say what she wants, without feeling threatened or pressured, if you want to get to the root of the issue.  Getting mad and storming out, is only going to get her to conceal her feelings, and if that happens, good luck correcting them.  She may be 100% wrong in her statements, but without knowing and acknowledging her feelings, it is worthless.  Even if the way she feels is valid to nobody else but herself, that is what needs work.  You lose that with the actions taken.\n\nSecond, at face value you are correct in regards to weight - but there is also something to be said about people that continuously enable one another.  If your partner constantly eats healthy and exercises, it is easier to make that a habit and incorporate it into your everyday life.  If your partner and friends are drug users, it is a lot harder to quit while maintaining the same relationship that you have had with them.  The environment and relationships can play a role in success, or downward spirals, even if you only want to blame the person.", "Yikes! I've never been to couples therapy and that sounds scary.", "Not saying it can't happen but in around 20 years its only happened to me a couple of times and then when I've been doing pretty intense exercise.  And yep, definitely not the same or near as serious as it is for type 1.", "This statement bothers me. Have you not learned anything about your condition? I mean, even limited research will tell you that the mood swings you're talking about are often a result of depression/anger over the condition and not just the condition itself.\n\nI was diagnosed with type 2 in January of 2020.

She is SOLELY responsible for HER weight.", "With the first point I believe you are right. With the second point I completely disagree. From solely what OP says she has a lifestyle issue prior to this relationship even. Otherwise healthy people really need to take accountability when it comes to the issue of weight. Working out and eating moderately healthy is not some burdensome task that only a select few can accomplish. This is the baseline of what it means to be a normal person in other countries.", "It happens to me all the time because the medication is working, and I tend to forget to eat.

Yes, it is ultimately your responsibility - but that doesn't mean that it can't be easier or harder based on those factors.  Look at weight loss - there are plenty of studies to show that doing it with a partner significantly increases your chances of success.  If you are trying to get off of drugs, the first thing they will tell you is to get away from the people that you did drugs with.  Not because it still isn't your choice, but because the temptation is a lot great when it is around you, it is what you know, and is normalized.", "There is a book called \"Living a Healthy Life with Chronic Conditions.\" It helped me a lot.

Prenatal diabetes (the medical term for it escapes me) is also not uncommon). Any health issues she has can absolutely affect the baby in utero.

I\u2019ve left therapy sessions because the therapist just kept saying \u201cwe\u2019ll get you on meds and talk\u201d instead of doing their actual job. Finally found one that wanted to do their job and viola, I understood my depression more and how to combat it. Not sedate my feelings even more than I\u2019ve already tried.", "No, couples therapy isn\u2019t the best place to hash out what are deeply personal issues unique to both op and his gf separately. This therapist is a hack for even attempting to make their weight gain a couples therapy issue.", "YTA for walking out on therapy, but I have to disagree with part of the above post. \n\nHe may have invalidated her, but honestly, her argument was invalid *to begin with* - her weight gain is not OP\u2019s fault. At the end of the day she has the ability to decline food, to be more active for herself. Unless he is physically restraining and feeding her (which I seriously doubt), she is refusing to take responsibility for something which, according to OP\u2019s post, began even before their relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s also tremendously insulting to blame your weight gain on someone else. OP needs to take accountability for the fact that, despite his assertions, their (mutual) communication **sucks** - but GF needs to take sole responsibility for her weight, and him for his.", "They\u2019ve also been together for a significant portion of their lives, and OP states she was 210 lbs (sorry, I am an American, stone is borderline meaningless to me) before. Unless she\u2019s Amazonian height, that\u2019s fat. Objectively. She clearly entered the relationship with weight and eating issues of some kind, too. \n\nNot even to mention the fact that at the end of the day, she is her own person. She has agency over her body to control what she does and what goes in. Not saying it\u2019s always easy, but tbh it\u2019s not really that hard either. As another poster said, eating healthy and exercising regularly is the baseline of normalcy in many countries. It would be better if that was true in all.", "The better response would have been to calmly respond with his feelings instead of storming out. \n\nHey baby, I don't agree with what you're saying. I feel we are both responsible for our weight gain and it isn't fair to blame me.\"", "I mean, yeah, couples therapy is a pretty ideal place to have a discussion where you disagree with what your partner is saying.", "Therapist here - yes, a couples therapy session is the place for that. The whole point is to have a safe space to learn better communication and problem solving. Working through an argument in session is one of the ways we accomplish this.", "But in the post, op explicitly states that the couples therapy was for their weight. I\u2019m pretty sure they went into therapy specifically to talk about their weight problems and figure out what cause for it was.", "Therapist here and yes it is. The whole point is to process these deeply personal issues. It is not inappropriate to talk about. With all due respect, unless you are a therapist, you have no business making judgements about what is appropriate in therapy.", "Walking out of a conflict is a big sign of attachment issues, specifically avoidant attachment. But do go on about how you know exactly what your problem is that has nothing to do with your emotions.", "Example five million of reddit uses the word abuse in a way that is offensive to people who have suffered abuse.", "I mean I get why\u2019d he\u2019d get so mad. He didn\u2019t force her to eat all the food she did. I have a quick temper and I likely would\u2019ve done the same, or raised my voice and tell her to take responsibility for her own actions. Again, this has nothing to do with his feelings. It has everything to do with her blaming him for her wrong doings.", "My dude, you can\u2019t go from zero to \u201cfast walk\u201d. JFC. You have to start slowly enough that you\u2019re able to do the activity without getting wrecked, and you have to be able to repeat the activity at least 3x a week, AND you have to commit to the activity (you will walk/exercise bike/elliptical train every Tu/ Th /Sa or whatever). Then you gradually increase the distance or speed."]}
