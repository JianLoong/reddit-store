You are probably going to have more fun going with friends and I hear that Indian Weddings are amazing.   You should go.  Good luck!", "YWNBTA for going to India. \n\nTo be honest, I think you need to seriously assess if this is the right relationship for yourself before you get married and before you buy a house together. My partner and I are on completely different financial levels. One of us comes from money and the other earned everything themselves. The former pays about 90% of the bills for utilities, mortgage, restaurants, etc and the latter pays what they can. This is what a partnership looks like when the financial disparity is so high. It's not supposed to be literally 50/50 unless you're both making the same and have the same or similar debt loads. A true partnership is ensuring both partners feel safe and respected and that they're contributing to the best of their abilities. It's not equality, it's equity! If let's say he makes $100k and you make $50k, your 50% is $25k and his 50% is $50k. So at the end of the day he still has double than you. So obviously you're always going to be behind in saving. How is this fair? Are YOU ok with this? If you are, that's all that matters. \n\nAlso, you shouldn't stop living your life for $1000. This friend only gets married once (hopefully). You've never been to India and would love to explore and celebrate your friend. Why shouldn't you go? He should be encouraging you. This isn't the same as you blew $1000 on a new fancy jacket or a pair of shoes. This is an experience and to celebrate your friend. \n\nYou're here asking strangers for validation because you want to go. Surely deep down you kind of feel like he's trying to financially control you. You haven't even bought a house together yet and he's already trying to tell you how you can spend your money and threatening buying a house without you. Ok then, go buy the effing house!", "Nta. Do not buy a house with your partner if you are not married. Do you feel it's fair that you are contributing 50% when he earns so much more than you? No judgment either way, but him getting mad that you want to use 1k  on a trip and his threats to move along in the home buting process without you do not paint a picture of someone Id recommend you invest all your savings with.", "NTA. Overall, it\u2019s understandable that you had an arrangement with your partner. However, you should still enjoy your life. You cannot put it on hold and be unhappy for a few years.\n\nOverall, sounds like there are some other issues in your relationship.", "NTA.  Your partner is more concerned about whats in your bank account then yiur happiness. \n\nI cant imagine what sharing finances would be like with him. \n\nThis is borderline financial abuse.", "Oh, NTA. If it's a dear friend of mine and I have the money, I would definitely go. I'd love to go. Opportunities like this is seldom. You get to see the culture of another country, have fun and celebrate your friend's happy occasion.\n\nIf he really doesnt think anything of the 1k he would let you go. You are doing your best to save. HE is selfish for letting himself go to a christmas vacation with friends but wont let you go to an event you want to go to. You don't need his permission. All you need is notify him of your decision, that's it. Do what you want. Enjoy life. Be with your friends and have lots of fun in India!", "NTA. However guess who is... Your partner sounds entitled and controlling. He seems to be projecting, and maybe is the selfish one here. He is speaking double talk here.\n\nHe is harping on you, knowing you guys are in two financial brackets however fails to understand ratio based mathematics. Your 50% will not be his 50%. You strike me as someone, who is self-aware, and is in fact saving towards a goal at a modest and honest pace. You are employed. He signed up for a relationship with you. He is holding it over your head to \"catch up\" with him... So wtf? You cannot have a life and travel, yet it is okay for him to go off during the Christmas holiday? It's okay to do some small enjoyable things while saving. You care for your friend, they are having a unique wedding, you believe for a one time thing you can drop 1k to go. Maybe as a Gentleman, he can gift you by paying for that ticket to go to your friends wedding in India. You're his lady. It is less than 1k and he is bragging about 1k being nothing to him. And on that note, he is speaking about owning a house, is he speaking about making you a wife/husband..? Crying over 1k LOL.\n\nAt the same time, not going to a destination wedding, is not going to badly impact your life, it is his behaviour here that I find problematic. This is a foreshadowing to your relationship dynamics. You're right it's YOUR money. You need to be mindful of men who are like this. He does seem rigid in his logic here. You probably could buy a house with him today, but if shit isn't 50/50 down the middle for him, he won't do it.\n\nWhen my older half-sister got married 10 years ago, her husband was low income employed, and was rebuilding his finances after a divorce and two kids. She already had equity from being a home owner and working in corporate as an educated, single mom herself. They bought a nice big house together, based on the majority of her contribution and a small amount he put in. Ultimately he ended up being the one paying the mortgage, and utilities, while she takes care of domestic expenses. This occurred as he progressed financially, and made more money. They created a symbiotic dynamic to handle the household expenses and he earned his keep.\n\nYo... I'm not even trolling.. You're 25 and perky.. You might want to trade this guy in and keep your pimp hand strong lol. There are some great guys out here who would not be mad if you went to India knowing you are financially still saving your money and pacing yourself. Frugality is not equivalent to smart, or strategic savings, and investments. People who are financially tit-for tat are a f\\*\\*\\*ing headache later in life. Everything is not going to be 50/50. My father was the same way, and he went through two trivial divorces. His standard of living is garbage while he sits on his money like a Leprechaun at age 80. He doesn't even enjoy retirement life.\n\nYou only live once OP.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re 25\u2026..I bought my first house at 40 so you\u2019ve got plenty of time! \n\nNow is the time to travel before you have commitments \n\nI don\u2019t like the way your boyfriend is manipulating you by saying he\u2019ll just go ahead and buy a house if you don\u2019t come up with the money within the next year or two\u2026\u2026A partnership is supposed to be equal and if he is already holding you to certain standards it makes me wonder if he\u2019ll get worse as time goes on\u2026..Don\u2019t be pressured into being blackmailed by him, Maybe it\u2019s time to reassess things with him \n\nI have no regrets to travelling at your age and I feel it made me a more knowledgeable person\u2026.Have an amazing time!", "INFO: why must you put in the same amount for the house deposit?

You can't be 50-50 on everything, and then he gets frustrated that he is living below his means.

It is a perceived ideal. Two people can purchase a house where someone puts more into the purchase.

Lets say we had a falling out, and I wanted to break up. You love the house, I don't care about it.
