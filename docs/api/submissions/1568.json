We have never had and feelings for one another and will never have it either. She is like a sister to me.\n\nMy gf (23f) has come to love her as well.

I actually thought that he was a great guy, I saw him as a good friend for the first 5 months of their relationship. I was happy for her and my gf as well. There weren\u2019t any red flags but now I can\u2019t say that I want to be near him.\n\nHe is ALWAYS drunk, even when he\u2019s with her alone. He is depressed and won\u2019t seek help. He has made my best friends life hell, she is a shell of the person she was and I\u2019m honestly concerned about her mental health. \n\nMy gf talked to me about them and has raised her concerns, she is worried and so am I, she is not happy anymore. She is drunk constantly as well and me and other friends had a talk with her yesterday. \n\nWe raised our concerns and told her we are worried about her and that we can\u2019t force her to break up with him but he has changed her from a happy and loving person to a complete stranger. I don\u2019t recognize my best friend anymore.\n\nShe told us to stop worrying about her and that everything is fine and that they are getting married. The whole room went silent. She looked at me and said \u201c what do you think?\u201d And I honestly said I don\u2019t support it, I think she will be doing a terrible mistake. \n\nShe shouted, cried and told me and everyone to leave. My Friends said I should have just congratulated her and said I was happy for her. I pointed out that none of them said anything either but my gf told me as her best friend I should be happy for her.

I hope she can get the help she needs before spiraling down the path of alcoholism and mental illness.", "NTA You can support your friend even if you don't support her choice. And not cheerleading her downward spiral IS supporting her. She just doesn't realize it yet.", "NTA. You told her the truth because you are her best friend, you'd be doing her a disservice by supporting this. Hopefully this will make her open her eyes.", "NTA there is a difference between supporting and Enabling. You didn't want to enable her.", "NTA you as her best friend did her a massive service by pointing out things as you see it. \n\nYour friend is trap on the \"I can fix/help/save him\" falacy, and the more he drags her down to his level the harder it will be for her to realize she cant change him. The intervention you did as a group was not a bad step but people on situations like your best friend tend to be defensive when being called out. \n\nFake sympathy or fake acceptance is the worst thing you can do as she would use it as reinforcement that she is doing the right thing. I want to believe the crying was not only for the lack of support but also maybe it finally dawned on her that nobady things her relationship is a positive thing and it would lead to the introspection she needs to leave her bf", "NTA, and what you've done is incredibly difficult though also best considering the circumstances. I hope that she one day sees she's fortunate she has someone who does care enough to speak up and tell her about real worries and concerns instead of ignoring the problems.", "NTA. Even if the relationship is not abusive YET, with someone that has alcohol problems it surely is more concerning especially when that person doesn\u2019t want to get help either for the problem. I\u2019d day, if she wants to, you should talk to her heart to heart. Not bashing the person she is in love with or anything, but ask her honestly what her plans are with this person, and somehow make her see that this can\u2019t go on like that. Alcohol will ruin them both, either by drinking, or being afraid of the other when they just had a little too much to drink.", "If he is an alcoholic then she most likely will be pulled along with him. It\u2019s referred to as a family disease as those intimately involved are impacted heavily.\n\nYou told your truth, and only you know if you said it with love or with frustration; I would suggest that saying it in a group setting isn\u2019t the best option. \n\nThis may be a long and tough ride for her, it\u2019s up to you if you want to be there. If you do chose to be there then you also need to accept where she\u2019s at & figure out your boundaries around that. And then hold them.\n\nWith the info I have I\u2019m going for a super soft YTA for calling her out like this in a group setting.", "Are sweet lie better than bitter truth? NTA", "NTA I would write her a letter just letting her know that you love her but that her relationship has reached a level of toxicity that it is spilling that toxicity out into other people's lives and that you have to step away for your own mental health. Let her know that you will be there for her when she's ready to start healing but that you can't follow her down her path", "NTA\n\nHowever this is going to cost you your relationship. \n\nYou did the right thing, and were ethical to a fault. This is a good thing and you are a good person for doing it. \n\nThat does not mean that you are going to be rewarded for your goodness. You are most likely going to lose this very important relationship to you. Ethics frequently have this as a result.", "Nahhh, NTA. Maybe you could have said it in a softer way, but you're her friend and you care about her. I think a healthy friendship is where you can tell somebody you care about that you are honestly concerned about them.\n\nSo yeah, overall NTA. Maybe you could have said it softer like, \"I think you're moving a little fast. Can we talk about this later, when tensions aren't as high?\" But I think you're reasonably concerned about a lot of red flags. \n\nAlcohol makes it tough, too, because most people aren't ready for the intervention. Just be as supportive as you can without letting yourself get pulled down in the undercurrent.", "NTA. You would be supporting her in encouraging her to get away from this BF.  If she stays on this path it looks like her life may become very, very sad.\n\nShe is far down into this relationship, and now that she drinks frequently, she may not be able to see what's going on very clearly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That may come at a price though. I had a situation with a friend where I spoke up and said the what I felt about his situation. He got very angry with me at the time and stopped speaking to me for a long time. 5 years later, he tracked me down and apologized for his harsh words. He realized that I was being objective for him when he was unable to be objective for himself. He had realized that what I had said was the truth and he was unable to hear it at that time. Also, he understood how hard it was for me to speak up at the risk of losing a friendship instead of just agreeing with what he wanted to hear. We had a great talk and cleared the air about everything, but it took years for him to get there.", "Pls don\u2019t abandon her, you might now be close or keep in touch often but she\u2019s going to need someone to stick around and help her out when she eventually realised how fucked up her situation is. NTA", "I don't know about AH here but it is a fact that telling an adult:\"this relationship is not right for you\" has literally never come to any good.", "NTA. She may not take your advice, but it was reasonable of you to give it. 'A vague disclaimer is nobody's friend.'", "Nta you were honest.\n\nDo yourself a favor go to an alanon  meeting.  It might give you differing view points and strategies. Or at least a coping mechanism.", "NAH. Your heart was in the right place, but I don't think a public setting was the right time.", "NTA no you should absolutely not lie to her!! This situation is bad and she needs to hear that from the people she trusts", "Fair point, might not have been the best decision to say it in front of all our friends but no one said anything and I was put on the spot.", "Good suggestion. Make a laminated card to go with it wallet sized.  Stating if she needs help and wants to start over call you. Request she puts it by her drivers license.", "That was brave of you. Sorry to hear you lost your friendship for a while but  Im glad he came round in the end.", "If a relationship leads you to alcoholism, then it is not good for you, at least for your health.", "I get that, I truly hope this works out for all of you, it seems like no matter what it\u2019s going to get a bit gnarly.\n\nSerious amounts of empathy and love your way", "Yta.  That was the rhetorical question.   She doesn\u2019t care about your opinion. She wants to be happy and she thinks this guys doing that.   A truly good friend accept reality and will be there if she falls", "NTA.\n\n\nYou care about her. She's like family.\n\n\nHowever and this is difficult to accept: you cannot make her choices for her. You cannot force her to wake up and realize what you know. It all has to be her choice and her wake up moment.\n\nWatching her lose herself will hurt you.\n\nIt's your choice on what to do: stay and watch her fall or refuse to watch but tell her she's welcome back when she finds herself again(in order to protect yourself knowing you can't protect her from herself) or to cut contact.\n\nThere aren't too many other choices. My grandmother who passed away a long time ago would have put the fear of God in him to stay away from her, in a very legal way I'm sure.  But she finds out she might hate you and still ruin her own life.\n\nSad and my heart goes out to you guys.", "NTA. This is what friends do: be honest with each other to keep each other from making horrible mistakes.", "NTA. \nShe doesn't want your advice. Fine. But she'll need you when it's over. Be quietly there. \n\nDistance from the dude. Go to the wedding if there is one so that she knows she hasnt alienated you forever. Don't object or ruin it or anything. Be her friend. And be there when it's over. \n\nIf I didn't have a friend who did that for me I'd be dead now. Having someone who \"told me so\" then left it alone and still maintained a 2 bedroom apartment solely so that me and my daughter had a safe spot to land after my husband finally almost killed me quite literally saved my life. It's been over a decade and I'm still grateful to that friend now for not allowing me to cut our friendship off because I wasn't ready to hear good sense.", "NTA Lying would have only encouraged her downward spiral. You told her what she NEEDED to hear not what she WANTED to hear. Friends tell the truth. \n\nI did the same for my former best friend of 19 years.  She didn't like it and we are no longer in contact. But I wasn't going to lie to her.\n\n It was an intervention for your friend. She needed to hear the truth over lies.", "NTA. And you Are supporting Her by Not supporting her potential marriage.", "Don\u2019t really think it was, she got awkward as the room went silent, I didn\u2019t want to say anything but she put me on the spot. Our relationship has since the beginning been that we don\u2019t keep secrets and always say what we think, I followed that principle"]}
