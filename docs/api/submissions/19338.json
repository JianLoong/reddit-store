A lot of this is built up resentment between the two of us as I\u2019m the older sibling who had to raise the younger siblings and she\u2019s the younger sibling who doesn\u2019t like being told what to do. She started to resent me during her teenage years and that hasn\u2019t changed much since then. She is the kind of person that throws a fit on other people\u2019s birthdays and always wants to be the center of attention. \n\nI graduated with my MBA last month, and invited my family as I\u2019m the first person in my family to graduate from college, let alone a graduate degree. I had asked my sister if she would want to come rather than insinuate and she said \u201c of course!\u201d. \n\nWell the day came and my partner was busy helping me get ready so I asked my family to pick up coffee for us if they were already going. My partner and I got to the venue a bit late because we got lost and during that time my sister was calling me non stop to tell me she had our coffee. By the time I was able to answer I was stressed and answered the phone in such a tone with a very upset \u201c WHAT?!\u201d. Well that set my sister off and once I actually arrived at the front of the venue she started cussing me out. I did apologize to her and explained to her that I was overall stressed, we got lost, my signal was going in and out, and was very hungry. She was upset that I had picked up the phone in an angry tone and then started to yell at me about how I am in general. Like I said we have a very tough relationship and a lot of it is just personality differences plus her own mental health issues that she doesn\u2019t want to deal with. She then went inside to my family and said that I was upset with them ( I wasn\u2019t) and I started getting calls and texts asking if I wanted them to leave. At this point I was just extremely stressed and sobbing after being yelled at for 5 minutes by my sister and having my family upset wanting to leave. My partner\u2019s parents showed up at this point and were trying to calm me down so I could head inside for the ceremony. \n\nThings went relatively smoothly from there but my partner and I are now talking about getting married. We have been planning this for a bit and are most likely just going to do a civil marriage down at city hall. They have an option to invite a small group of family members which I would like to do but I don\u2019t really want to invite my sister. At this point, i feel like she\u2019s ruined enough for me and has a lot of anger towards me that it wouldn\u2019t be enjoyable. TBH I\u2019m still mad at her about my graduation and feel like for the most part she ruined the experience for me. But I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it to hold onto that anger from my graduation and not invite her.\n\nEdit: to include how I approached her after my answering the phone.", "created_utc": 1686271602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144qk60/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_my_sister_to_my/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Will this damage even further you and you your sister's relationship? Will this impact the way the family views you from now on? I think you get the idea.  With choices there are sometimes consequences, and this is a loaded choice to be sure.\n\nYou do have some options.  If you truly do not want your sister in attendance. Then do not invite any siblings and just parents for both you and your fianc\u00e9.  That way no one can say played favourites or were picking on your sister. OR. You can talk to your parents about this and see what they say and what they think.

She\u2019s younger so she might not be there mentally yet and it might take a couple of years if ever, but y\u2019all need to have an honest conversation about the roles you were forced to play.

Then she waaaay overreacted (and yes she should maybe have sucked it up a bit because it\u2019s a big day for you). Overall you guys sound like a matched pair to me.\n\nHowever not inviting her to your wedding (if the rest of your close family will be there) will leave a family scar you can never take back. If that\u2019s what you want then no problem, but that means you will likely be excluded from all the other important events pertaining to her life not limited to her own wedding, possible baby showers and christenings etc which the rest of your family will attend.
