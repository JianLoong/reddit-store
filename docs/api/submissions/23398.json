Her husband told me she wanted to use them for a \"godly life \" photo album to give to her kids (the idea was given by her children\u2019s school to \"promote\" god to kids) and wanted to use my photos as a example for sin (in my prom pictures I am visibly a little intoxicated). After I said no to her little album she told me I was being unreasonable and that I should give them to her so some good comes out of my sinning on that night. I don\u2019t want my nieces and nephews to see me that way and I am pretty sure she would show that album to all the moms she knows( we have a lot of mutual friends that are very judge\u2019y). She said she isn\u2019t talking to me until I give them to her.

All that it proves/shows is that you had too much to drink and still ended living a perfecty normal life.   \n\n\nAt least, if you want to make a caricature, choose caricatural exemples rather than try to find a reason to put you down for an event that was almost 20 years ago?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your sister is scary and a bigot. Get as far away from her as possible as it seems bigotry is contagious in the US. \nThose are your picture, do what you want with it, but my point of view is that her total lack of Christian love towards you will get her straight to hell. I even Google it for you \ud83d\ude09. Share it with her, just to make me laugh.\n\nLuke 15:7. Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance", "NTA what a jerk she is to want her children to see you in a negative light.   Prom was one night almost 20 years ago! Has she always been jealous of you for some reason that she feels the need to make you look bad?", "NTA. Jesus turned water into wine. \n\nBecause he thought people drinking alcohol at a wedding was so important that he needed to perform a miracle to do have alcohol. \n\nIf alcohol is so bad, please explain this miracle to me.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds really out there and unreasonable on so many levels.\n\nI mean, WTF with a \u201cgodly life\u201d album?????\n\nI feel bad for her kids being raised in that environment.", "I'm sorry, OP, but this literally made me laugh out loud. I know it's a real thing for you, but your sister sounds like a tv villain. \n\nFor what it's worth, absolutely 100% nta. \n\nI'd ask your sister for a single picture of her face. When she asks why, I'd say it's for your 'godly' book and she's the perfect face for 'judge not less ye be judged'. \n\nAlso, this book sounds like one of the worst gifts ever. Right out of ultra-christian etsy.", "it basically boils down to her wanting to use you as a bad example, to indoctrinate and fear monger her kids.  \n\nYeah, I\u2019m gonna have to say NTA.", "O\\_O\n\nHoly \\*beep\\*, what did I just read?\n\nLet me get this straight... You went to prom and got a little drunk, which is not strange, nor unusual or even bad for that matter, and it is most definitely not a 'sin'. And your sister , apparently, still holds it against you despite the fact that several decades have come and gone? And now she's trying to turn you into the black sheep of the family because of it? To use YOU - her sister, as the \"this is most definitely not what you should be doing, my lovely children, because your aunt *sinned*\"? Because she feels the need to indoctrinate her kids into believing complete BS? Despite the fact that a simple google search could give her a perfectly suitable photo for her fucked-up purpose in just a matter of moments?\n\nNTA. And congrats on your sister going NC with you. That's a toxic influence you don't need in your life, hallelujah! And if your sister tries to get back into  contact with you gain, feel free to tell her that this internet stranger is hereby telling her to get a life and get therapy.", "Whoa. Your sister is a bit unhinged. If she\u2019s so determined to include a pic with someone intoxicated, there are plenty on the internet. \n\nThey\u2019re your freakin\u2019 photos and it\u2019s your choice to share or not. \n\nNTA. Don\u2019t share. And you\u2019re better off not having to ever talk to her again. Frankly, that\u2019s a bonus.", "I'm sorry, what did I just read?\n\nCan you please give me some personal property so I can use it to indoctrinate my children on my definition of morality in which you will represent the negative? Pretty please? I'm putting my foot down until you do.\n\nNTA.\n\nHey, sis, can you send me a picture of yourself? I'm making a scrapbook of how to treat people with decency and I want a picture of you so I can show what not to do.", "NTA, getting a little drunk isn\u2019t a sin and even if it were you don\u2019t have to submit yourself to being a perpetual bad example to her kids or your community. Your sister\u2019s ridiculous. If she wants to give her kids an album of bad examples (which is weird af by the way) she can always just type in \u2018drunk person\u2019 on the internet and find a stock photo", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't carter to your AH sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She said she isn\u2019t talking to me until I give them to her.\" .. tell her you hope she will keep that generous promisse.", "NTA. They are your photos to do with as you will. Your sister is a judgmental jerk and you are likely better off letting her give you the silent treatment.", "NTA. She can go find pictures of drunk people on the internet. She does not need to shame or degrade you for her weird god kink.", "NTA not only do you have the right to choose who gets access to photos of you, but she's blatantly said that she wants to use the photos to paint you as a bad example. Why on Earth would you ever say yes?? If she doesn't want to talk to you over this, good riddance.", "Holy shit, NTA. Your sister is unhinged and she's continuing to shame you in a passive aggressive way many years after the fact. That's unhealthy.", "NTA, your sister wants to use you as a bad example for her kids", "She might need a little introspection and think on her demands of you in regards to the seven deadly sins.", "Hey, give me those shitty pictures of you so I can use them to try and shame you to my kids and friends. Your sister is a giant arsehole, you are not.", "NTA. They are photos of you, you get to choose who does and doesn't have access to them. I'm sorry your sister is like this.", "Wtf did I just read? Your sister is judging your youthful indiscretion of drinking on prom night as an an example of a sinner?  Didn\u2019t know that was such a terrible sin!  Don\u2019t give her your pictures so that she can portray you as a heathen to her kids and her friends/their kids .  She needs help, her demanding and ultimatum is ridiculous.  To be honest, you\u2019re probably better off with her not talking to you.  \n\nHe that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone\u2026.\n\nNTA", "You won't talk to me until I allow you to personally shame me to your children with my own photos?\n\nDon't threaten me with a good time.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but your sister is, I didn\u2019t think people like this still exist. Sin shaming someone isn\u2019t helpful, it causes you to run from, not to, God so in the end she\u2019s being counter productive anyway.", "NTA, geez, does your sister hate you?  All of the examples she can use, she picks that one?  Maybe she should include a photo of herself to depict the sin of envy.", "Wtf lol is your sister on crack? That\u2019s your property. Why does she feel like you owe her this ? \nNTA. She is.  Tell her to go sniff grass.  What a weirdo.", "Lol all this god stuff is absolute nonsense", "NTA.  Man I feel sooo bad for those poor kids. People like op sister really should NOT be allowed to reproduce.", "She isn't speaking to you until you give them to her. \n\nThat sounds like two problems solved at once, to me!", "NTA. And what a wonderful gift of silence she has given you. Not sure what type of community you live in but being tipsy at a party isn't really a sin. I mean Jesus was turning water into wine at parties. \n\nShe has no claim to your photos esp if the purpose is really to shame you to mutual friends. She's a little too caught up in all this. Id remind her that being covetous of your neighbour's ass is also a sin.", "What a blessing that she removed her miserable, judgmental self from your life and you didn't have to lift so much as a finger or raise your voice! Bravo, OP.\n\nShe sounds absolutely awful but maybe you could ask her for some pictures of her so that you can show your kids what an awful person you become when you believe in God.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your sister is trying to score points off a mistake you made as a teenager which shows a tremendous lack of respect for you. But I would make sure those pics aren't online anywhere at the risk of her just printing them out and using them anyway.\n\nAnd, honestly, if she's not talking to you until you give her the pictures you're far better off.", "OMG! Making a sinner from your own sis, even if she was not in her best shape is humiliating. I wouldn't give her anything. I don't believe in living saints, I am sure your sis is not one, so she is actually bad person trying to look down on others, which is sin of vanity itself.", "Nta. I would Get them professionally photo shopped to add her face onto your body. Look at how sinful mom is muahahaha", "NTA in the slightest. Your BIL is an absolute AH for wanting to do this and so is your sister for being a child about it.", "NTA. Your nieces and nieces and nephews do not need a picture of teenage you being intoxicated to see what intoxicated looks like. They can find that through the media or society in general. You don't need to be the example of that if you don't wish to be.", "NTA\n\nYou got a bit drunk on prom night years ago and your sister has decided to hold that incident against you for the rest of your life. Don\u2019t give her that picture so she can use it as an example of a \u201csinner.\u201c You\u2019re right that is judgmental. Has she always been like this?", "She's unreasonable, pushy, entitled, rude.", "NTA, l wonder if you have photos or records of her in a less than positive light, because you could give those as an example to her kids, honestly she sounds like an insufferable god botherer and hypocrite, treat it as a positive that she is not talking to you, as you will be spared her preaching.", "NTA. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me with a good time.\u201d Sister or not, why be blackmailed for someone to talk to you, care about your niblings\u2019 view of you, love you?", "I think the penalty sounds like a reward.", "Nta - yikes", "Obviously, you're not the AH. Your sister is.", "NTA.\nEdit her face onto them and then maybe send one?", "Ask your sister to go f$uk off and never show her face again. The nerve!!!! NTA", "NTA.  At least you will have some peace and quiet.  While it is quiet, take a look at old photos of your sister.  Bet there are a few lovely ones in the archives that you can collect and form an even better 'sin album.'  Make sure to give it to the kids without mom around so they can see the results of sin in their mother.", "NTA. \n\nThey're your pictures, do with them as you please. Simple as that. Or just plain tell her \"Oh those? I never kept those pictures\".", "NTA if she wanted pictures she could google all the sins she wanted and some she's never even heard of. Using your pictures is just an excuse to shame you.", "NTA  She is the AH for asking for such a reason. She is trying to prove to people she is such a better person than you. Can you find a picture of her that might not fit in the sin category?", "NTA. And this is honestly a bit bonkers. Your sister wants to use you as a poster child to \"not drink or do drugs\" (I know you weren't on drugs, but I hope you get point). That's massively disrespectful and totally inappropriate. You are certainly NTA, but your sis really f***ing is .", "NTA there's no hate like Christian love.", "Fan fiction", "NTA. Your sister has no right to use your photos for her agenda, especially without your consent. She is trying to shame you and make you feel bad for something that happened years ago. \n\nYou have every right to keep your photos and not give them to her. She is the one who is being unreasonable and childish.", "NtA but maybe go NC with toxic Christianity barbie?", "NTA. She's sinning right now by judging you! Tell her to draw a picture of herself and give it to the school.", "NTA", "Lmao what the fuck?  NTA, your sister is a disgusting bigot.  I feel very sorry for any children being raised by her.", "NTA - Judgey ass sister needs to be reminded she is meant to leave the judgey stuff to her God. \n\nAlso wtf kinds family/school does that kinda weird ass shame collage", "NTA. Your sister and her husband however... well, they're being pretty judgy so get them to post on here and be judged.", "NTA\n\nYoursister may have kids, but she\u2019s the one who needs to grow up", "NTA.", "NTA and it also shows that, based on the response, her sister is a shitty Christian.", "Enjoy the break from her not talking to you. She sounds delightful! /s. NTA", "I d8dnt think of this!\n\n\nLet her use the photos and then make SURE you tell your nieces and nephews how easy it is to have fun, break God's law and still be a successful human who isn't Satan embodied lol.", "What a perfect verse to describe this situation\ud83d\ude02", "You could give those as an example to her kids, honestly she sounds like an insufferable god botherer and hypocrite", "Well she started acting like this ever since I married my husband and gave birth to my first child. I thought this small bickering on her part would stop after she got married but it didn\u2019t really. Not sure how I can help our relationship to grow.", "I wish I could upvote this more", "At the suggestion of the school, no less. Like to know more about that school and the suggestion. A book of good deeds to inspire is one thing. A book of photos of family members being presented as sinful another -  how to make your children live in fear.", "It is hilarious. \"Hi, send me some childhood photos that probably mean a lot to you so I can make fun of you.\" This is one of the most entertainingly deranged posts we've seen here lately.\n\n> She said she isn\u2019t talking to me until I give them to her.\n\nDon't threaten me with a good time, hottie.", "Well, it isn't being unhinged, kind of a prerequisite for being religious?", "Don't threaten me with a good time.", "People who point fingers hate having fingers pointed at them.", "She's toxic, why would you want your relationship with her to grow?\n\nShe's poisonous, minimize contact with her and fine other people with whom to grow a relationship.", "Bwahahaha! Yes. I find Uber religious people to be unhinged. Especially those who talk about godly life and sin all the time. \n\nI will say, though, that my daughter married into a very Catholic (she actually converted) family. Church every week, very involved in the church community. And they are also some of the kindest, least judgy people I know. They would give you a limb if you needed it. Since meeting them and getting to know them (it\u2019s been a good 10 years) I\u2019ve mellowed a bit on religion (though it\u2019s more along the lines of, \u2018there are some hinged religious people\u2019 \ud83d\ude0f.)"]}
