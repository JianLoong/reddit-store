I think it\u2019s cultural however. Jewish culture and religion places a huge emphasis on questions. Growing up I was ENCOURAGED to try and poke holes in the faith of the rabbi. He explained that it made his faith stronger as well as letting him teach to where I was. But being allowed and even actively encouraged to ask questions and consider how aspects of Judaism fit into my own life was so wonderful. Now obviously the ultra religious Jews would probably not allow as much questioning (especially since I\u2019m a woman) but that\u2019s true of all religions that the more religious the more uptight.

Judaism has a strong history of prioritizing education and knowledge, but Christianity united people who wouldn\u2019t have that knowledge. It\u2019s something that could have been wonderful about it, but it also made it a fantastic weapon: the religious leaders were viewed as much more informed, so questioning them was almost unthinkable, and some people used that for corrupt purposes. While society developed towards more widespread education, a lot of the expectations in Christianity (eg, trusting religious authority figures and not questioning things) were pretty deeply ingrained by that point. There are denominations of Christianity that emphasize reading the Bible now, but the vast majority still leave interpretation to religious leaders.", "I love how your rabbi taught you. I was also raised that you cannot fully claim a belief unless you understand all arguments against it. Discussion should be the main goal of all beliefs. Knowledge is power, and while there are some questions we'll never have the answer to, your personal answer should come from deep introspection and thorough questioning."]}
