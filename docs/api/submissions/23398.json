{"id": 23398, "submission_id": "15cqihy", "title": "AITA for not giving my sister my prom photos?", "selftext": "My sister (f42) recently asked me (f36) for my prom photos. I kindly told her no. Her husband told me she wanted to use them for a \"godly life \" photo album to give to her kids (the idea was given by her children\u2019s school to \"promote\" god to kids) and wanted to use my photos as a example for sin (in my prom pictures I am visibly a little intoxicated). After I said no to her little album she told me I was being unreasonable and that I should give them to her so some good comes out of my sinning on that night. I don\u2019t want my nieces and nephews to see me that way and I am pretty sure she would show that album to all the moms she knows( we have a lot of mutual friends that are very judge\u2019y). She said she isn\u2019t talking to me until I give them to her. Aita?\n\nEdit: I Thought that I was maybe over reacting and that she just really wanted to help her kids understand sin and that maybe the humiliation could be worth it in the long run. Now when I am reading these comments I realise that she\u2019s definitely a piece of work and those pictures should have definitely not been her priority in our relationship. Now I know that the only thing those pictures in that album could have done is ruin relationships with my friends and family but also make my nieces and nephews feel bad and unworthy if they did something similar. Honestly no amount of books and prayers can make you not sin. The only thing that matters is that you learn from an experience. I truly thank everyone in the comments of this post that helped me really realise this.", "created_utc": 1690631816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cqihy/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_my_prom_photos/", "score": 3182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
