No reason for you to have anything to do with someone who insults your step-son. Have your partner deal with him. Your partner can buy presents for this relative - just with his own money.

I told him it's ok to be upset over things like that and if he needs to talk I'm here.", "Heartbreaking- but good on you for recognizing that this is unacceptable. Your step son definitely needs to see that you have his back here otherwise he could be subjected to tolerating worse abuse later in life. This behavior can be so damaging when normalized. Good on you for recognizing and taking action"]}
