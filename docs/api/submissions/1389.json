We both moved back to our dad\u2019s house because we both got new jobs, and it would be easier to save money and get our own place down the line. We moved into the house in May and things were going okay. I have been living with my mom for a while, so it has been an adjustment living with two other people and both being men. Well fast forward to the last couple of months, my brother has not been taking care of his dog. I know this because I\u2019m caring for him. A little background, my brother picked his dog up off the street. I don\u2019t really know when but he\u2019s had him ever since. My dad told my brother before he moved in that he wasn\u2019t going to take care of his dog and he has every right to take that stance. When I have time I\u2019ll take his dog on walks, I feed him daily, I recently bought him a cage because he was sleeping on a slab of carpet, and I gave him a bath recently because he was scratching himself very badly. I\u2019m certian he had flees but I\u2019m no vet. I want to take him in for a check up but I need to save some money because I know it will be expensive. Apparently my brother has a new girlfriend and he\u2019s been staying at her place. When I\u2019m home I\u2019ll take care of the dog. I\u2019ll make sure he has water, he eats, and I\u2019ll interact with him and give him some attention. I\u2019m also seeing someone, and she\u2019s living in Louisiana right now for school, and so I\u2019m spending a lot of time out there. When I\u2019m not here he doesn\u2019t get fed until I come back. I\u2019m not financially stable enough to care for a dog when I\u2019m saving for a car and an apartment, but I\u2019ll get there eventually. In the meantime I was looking to get an automatic feeder or something for the times I\u2019m gone. If I move out before my brother I plan on taking the dog with me, if he moves before me, I\u2019ll put up a fight to keep the dog at my dads. His dog has taken a strong liking torwards me and I like him, though he does need to be neutered ASAP!! But do you guys think I\u2019ll be an arse if I take my brothers dog?", "created_utc": 1667596767, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymarys/wibta_if_i_took_sole_ownership_of_my_brothers_dog/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe lynus helped my brother through a rough, dark, and hard time. I\u2019d feel terrible taking someone\u2019s comfort blanket away from them. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve been through a lot together. And me taking away something that possibly saves him, makes me feel awful. At the same time I feel for the dog. I feel like I would be the arse if I didn\u2019t choose to be the voice for the dog. A dog can\u2019t feed or take care of himself. That\u2019s what an owner is for and his owner has abandoned him unfortunately. I\u2019m caught in a dilemma.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
