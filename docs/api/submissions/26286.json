Mike used to be an alcoholic before he met my sister. It was really bad from what I heard but he sought help and is sober now. They have my niece Jess (4F).\n\nI often host them at my place so I can see my Jess. I make them lunch and we sit and chat. I just recently added a wine bar to my place. The glasses are visible because they\u2019re cute but I hid the alcohol. When my niece is here, I lock the doors using a magnetic child lock so it doesn\u2019t ruin the look but is still safe. Mike is aware of my wine bar, I mentioned it to them in case they had an issue with it but they said they were happy to still come over given my alcohol is not in view.\n\nToday, I had them and my mum over for lunch. My mum, sister and BIL were having a conversation in the kitchen and Jess was running around and trying to get into my wine bar. I asked her a couple times to stop trying to pull open the doors. She asked me what secrets I had in my wine bar where I told her it was only for adults. She kept asking me about the secrets in my wine bar and would not relent. To get her to leave it alone, I took one of the glasses from the bar area, fixed up some orange cordial for her at the wine bar and she was very happy she got to use the glass. It distracted her and we watched some tv while I enjoyed an orange juice in one of the glasses too. \n\nWhen everyone came back into the room, Jess immediately showed them the glass and said I got it from my wine bar (she said \u201dsecrets box\u201d which I thought was very cute). Mike looked a bit uncomfortable and they left soon after. About half and hour ago, Sarah texted me and told it was very cruel to serve Jess a drink from anything that\u2019s on my wine bar given Mike\u2019s history with alcohol. I apologised and said that I didn\u2019t think it was that deep, it\u2019s just a glass and that I will get her a regular glass next time. Sarah said that Mike didn\u2018t want Jess to be around the wine bar again and it will be a while before they come back.\n\nAITA for this? I didn\u2019t show her any alcohol or talk about it. I thought I did my best so that Jess wouldn\u2019t keep asking me about it. I asked our mum about it and she also sided with them.", "created_utc": 1693945623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16az3is/aita_making_niece_drink_from_my_wine_bar/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like he's still struggling.", "NTA-\n\n It's a glass. I make mocktails all the time with my collection.\n\nLike the worst thing that could've come out of it was that Jess breaking it.", "NTA \n\nThe fact that her drinking out of a fancy glass is already connected to alcoholism and that it is a trigger for him is concerning", "NTA. While I respect he may have issues, this is some projection on his end and it's reasonable to not have expected him to be so sensitive about it.", "NTA. Sounds like he still has lingering problems that he wants to blame you for. If he was uncomfortable, sounds like a HIM problem", "NTA. Your BIL just overreacted. Many people just look for excuses to stir drama. It always puzzles me when they do this in their spare time (as opposed to at work, which I can understand the reason for).\n\nSomething to keep in mind for the future.

Screw that! They don\u2019t need to come around if they feel like that! Your NTA! For serving orange juice in a \u201cbar glass\u201d they must live in a fantasy world if they think that that\u2019s wrong! Your NTA", "NTA.  Mike needs therapy.", "NTA.\n\nI think you were reasonable in your accommodations of his past issues.  A reasonable person wouldn't think using a glass from the bar for something non-alcoholic would be an issue.  You even apologized noting that you didn't think it would be an issue and it wouldn't happen again.  They are being a bit dramatic.", "NTA. Your reaction might not have been the most sensitive given the history of alcoholism in the family, but you didn't do anything wrong. Alcohol exists in society. Restaurants have bars. A great many people in the world drink. Burying your head in the sand over glassware is just too much.", "fancy restaurants give kids juice in wine glasses, it\u2019s just a glass. nta", "Fostering relationships are a two way street - give and take. Now with alcoholism, it\u2019s a sensitive subject because it\u2019s a disease. BIL can put personal boundaries to help him with his sobriety. It may also mean that he can\u2019t encroach on other\u2019s liberties to do so. So it maybe best that he doesn\u2019t visit your home (or for awhile) since the wine bar is triggering for him. And you have your right to have it there. \n\nI didn\u2019t think you giving your niece the juice in that particular glass came out of malice. Maybe it was done inadvertently given that the situation was a sore spot for him. \n\nMoving forward, I don\u2019t have any solid advice. It\u2019s all circumstantial but maybe silly straws/juice box can be your Switzerland.", "NAH, honestly i think it\u2019s okay for someone who\u2019s addicted to alcohol to be triggered by a wine glass. as someone who\u2019s dealt with addiction, even the most nonsensical things triggered negative emotions and lead me to use. \n\nhe may have seen his daughter with the glass and that triggered some kind of negative feelings. maybe they were overly concerned because the image of their daughter w a wine glass made them think their 4 year old daughter would grow up to drink and that rehashed old painful memories and concerns. it could be any number of reasons but i\u2019d give a successfully recovered alcoholic a pass on any kind of trigger related to alcohol.\n\nstill your gesture was completely harmless and normally not anything to worry about, basically i\u2019m saying their reaction probably didn\u2019t have much to do with you and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad nor them", "NAH as an alcoholic who\u2019s been sober for years, alcohol is actually quite traumatizing for me. I get panic attacks, it\u2019s not great. But I don\u2019t expect other people to realize this about me and accommodate every trigger. My heart sank a little in this story because I can easily see why they were so uncomfortable. I get uncomfortable when adults introduce kids to alcohol in any form, but I know that\u2019s not what you meant to do. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a bummer situation all-around.", "NTA, I used to call apple juice Nana's wine. We got served it in wine glasses. \n\nI grew up to be an adult who hates wine.", "NTA. They should parent their own child then, and not leave it to you to protect your stuff by distracting and amusing her with nefarious things like a glass of juice.", "NAH you didnt make her drink, and meant no harm, but obviously seeing your child daughter with 'wine' as an alcoholic can trigger. Especially when you have previously agreed on keeping alcohol out of sight.", "NTA, But it's kind of a shit situation, kind of a not your fault but still your problem sort of thing. Mike is obviously still struggling with his recovery if he's this sensitive and maybe he always will be. Some addicts can never be physically in the same space as something like a wine bar. It's a really nasty disease. Sorry you're having to deal with an alcoholic but at least he's a sober one. Maybe you can meet them at their place for a while, at least until he's recovered. But I don't think anyone's the AH  here except maybe \"addiction\". I feel bad for your niece though all she did was be curious and I'm sure she felt like she did something wrong even if no one said a word about it.", "I don't know if this makes you TA, but I do understand why they're upset. In general, I don't know that I would love my kids drinking from the \"secrets box,\" especially not if I had a past with alcoholism. I think it's one of those moments where you just don't do it again now that it has been discussed.\n\nEDIT because I can already see it coming: I know it wasn't a drink directly FROM the wine bar, but again, there's a history there for the Dad.", "Soft YTA. As a recovering alcoholic, Mike is probably very conscious about the allure of alcohol. Anything that makes drinking look glamorous to his young child has got to be a worry, given his history. Your sister and BIL probably thought you understood since you told them about the wine bar and explained only the glasses were visible. This was important enough to interrupt their conversation. However, you were trying to make your niece happy and didn\u2019t deliberately cross boundaries.", "Soft YTA. You did nothing wrong with Jess but you knew that it was a really sensitive subject for Mike and should have kept the kid away from the bar or asked the parents. Maybe now Jess is going to ask for another glass or talk about it and even if it's cute for us, it can be very hurtful for someone with alcohol issues.", "Against the grain but gentle YTA while there\u2019s nothing wrong with giving her juice this could\u2019ve been a teachable moment about respecting boundaries. I would\u2019ve just opened the cabinet and explained that this is special grown up juice and needs to be treated carefully as sometimes it can hurt people and make them sick. Giving the drink to her in a wine glass and not explaining WHY the cabinets are closed is only going to pique her interest in the cabinet more. It just reinforced in her mind \u201cthis is cool this is special im like the grown ups now\u201d hence her immediately getting excited about the wine bar and wanting to tell her parents. It\u2019s not necessarily about using the wine glass itself but giving her context to go with the fun part. Kids are sponges especially at that age so it\u2019s not crazy of them to worry about what she\u2019s being exposed to. Fixing it at the bar probably wasn\u2019t the best idea given that you are aware of the boundaries they have around alcohol and playing bartender does kinda glamorize drinking culture. Especially for a little kid who views you as cool auntie. While a lot of people are saying BIL is overreacting I think they handled it well, maybe sister was over the top with cruel clearly it was just lack of thought on your part, but given they didn\u2019t make a scene and it\u2019s their child just apologize and be more mindful in the future. \n\nJust as like another angle, I sometimes use my bong as a vase and I have a vase that was repurposed into a bong. Say my niece sees it and asks to use it to arrange some flowers. If the parents are against smoking, would it be still appropriate for me to let a four year old use the vase for an age appropriate and harmless activity? Alcohol culture is definitely more normalized hence why people are gonna say he\u2019s overreacting but I think they\u2019re valid in this case.", "YTA I'm afraid. The way it's all been set up and you talked about it made the wine bar a big attractive secret for your niece, and that didn't have to be the case.", "Wow. It's just a *wine glass*. NTA, let them cool down and hopefully they will realize that they can't hide their child from dish ware for the rest of her life.", "Talk about walking on eggshells. My father is an alcoholic, I went for food with him last week and he had no issues with me ordwring wine.\nIf he has this much of an issue I'm afraid he's just a sober drunk.", "Okay so I will this that if you start drinking at an earlier age you are more likely to develop alcoholism and idk what age he started drinking but I do think it\u2019s poor taste. Maybe not to someone that didn\u2019t have a drinking problem but to do so knowing he had one in the past and probably struggled with it everyday and then basically hahaha it\u2019s so cute she\u2019s pretending to be drinking even if she didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what she was doing that was the intent. It\u2019s like when parents put koolaid in the wine glass they think they\u2019re doing what the adult is doing. So no I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an ass\u2026I just think that it wasn\u2019t a good choice and by no means should you get your ass chewed up but just a sit down like hey we don\u2019t appreciate this because blah blah blah", "ESH.  I understand that your sister and BIL don't want to make drinking alcohol attractive to your niece.  But as a result, they should have just not come to your house or, since they decided to do so, should have kept closer tabs on Jess so that you weren't in the position of addressing all her questions solo.  For your part, I think there were several ways to handle this  that didn't involve making Jess a \"drink\" from the wine bar--something she obviously found fun and will probably bug you for again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was thoughtless but not deliberately cruel.", "JFC, 4-year-olds don't need \"fun sober options\" and won't for so long that they won't remember that by then anyway. They don't understand what alcohol is vs non-alcoholic drinks. What they need is simply to have \"secret boxes\" (i.e. bars full   \n of alcohol) demystified in the first place so they don't think that they're magically intriguing, special things that need exploring.\n\nYou facilitate healthy relationships with alcoholic spaces by not fostering relationships where alcohol is a \"secret\" or terribly intriguing to begin with, not by assuming that you need to offer \"fun sober options\" to a preschooler.", "Maybe they thought it wasn\u2019t appropriate?

This may sound odd if you don\u2019t have children, but I suggest avoiding \u201csecrets\u201d with children. It sets a precedent that adults holding secrets that kids know about is ok - I\u2019m sure you can see all the ways it could be really not ok. \n\nFor the drink part - maybe get her her own \u201cfancy\u201d glass that\u2019s kid appropriate and approved by her parents. As for the bar, again avoid \u201csecrets.\u201d With pre-approval from her parents, try an age-appropriate but honest approach - \u201cthe bar has wine in it, which is only for adults. Wine will make little kids super sick, and it can make some adults super sick too.\u201c \n\nYour sister and bil could have handled it better and certainly could have had an open conversation that was a learning moment for everyone.

I thought I was doing my best and she did stop trying to get into my cabinet of alcohols and immediately watched tv", "Yeah definitely, I\u2019m gonna give this time to cool off, completely empty the cabinet and counter space and see if they will then come over and I can apologise properly", "Its well worded but just passive aggressive enough to get the point across that \"if you didn't want your kid olaying with thr wine bar, next time step up and parent your child and tell them to leave jt alone.\"", "When I was little my grandma used to serve us milk at dinner in crystal goblets. We felt like the fanciest children in town!", "My mum used to let me drink lemonade from hers, Schloer when it was a special occasion", "My grandma had a wine glass she got from the Disneyland Hotel. I felt like a princess when she let me drink out of it.", "Please tell me you still do this as an adult \ud83d\ude42", "Thanks, was just something that I was curious about anyways. Their reaction is just way bigger than it should be. And ultimately it's on them to communicate these kinds of boundaries anyways and not just assume. If they had just said \"Don't do it again\" and got upset I'd say it was understandable, but going borderline no contact is just ridiculous honestly.", "This feels like a dumb question, but... they *do* know you *didn't* serve the four year old alcohol, right?  Could they have misheard \"mocktail\" as \"cocktail\" or something and *actually* think you made a vodka cran or something?", "I think NTA\n\nSince orange cordial could look like a screwdriver so I wonder if the glass wasn\u2019t the trigger for Mike, but the thought of that particular drink was, especially if his poison is vodka.", "It was whole combination of things. Not just one thing. Your intent wasn't to harm, but overall the entire picture made your brother-in-law uncomfortable.\n\n1) the \"secret\" box\n2) The beverage served in a glass intended for alcohol\n3) your bil's past history with alcohol and I'm sure he is a acutely aware that the children of alcoholics are more likely to become alcoholics than children of  non-alcoholics\n\nThese things are all tied together, it's not just one thing", "She sounds like a funny kiddo. I hope you guys get past this soon!", "Yes, but I lost the goblet at some point. I'm currently looking for one I can buy that looks like it might have been looted from the Vatican. I'm talking ostentatious to the point of tackiness.", "Yes they definitely knew. Immediately she said that I made her juice in the flamingo glass and it\u2019s so pretty - flamingo because the stem made it look like the glass had 1 leg lmao", "Maybe? It wasn\u2019t as vibrant as a screwdriver though, think very pale lightly diluted yellow drink", "I understand the glass more now. I\u2019m unsure of why the secret box made him uncomfortable when he\u2019s seen it in pictures before they decided to come over and my niece never saw the inside", "She\u2019s the best honestly. When they come over, it\u2019s the highlight of my week", "Fair enough. Still, any drink in a wine glass could easily be mistaken for a cocktail so just seeing or imagining that for an alcoholic could be enough to give them the itch.\n\nThis is all theory on my part btw since I haven\u2019t encountered anyone (that I\u2019m aware of) who is an alcoholic. Just throwing out a theory as to why Mike may be so impacted by this.", "it's all about a conglomeration of events that was not intentional.\n\nIf you listen to people talk about young formative experiences with addictive substances it's not uncommon for people that ppl talk about how it felt adult/grownup, cool, special, privileged.\n\nForgot to add -- secretive, like  a lot of people have stories about sneaking, their first taste of XYZ. Bet your bil has a memory like that too.\n\nthrough an unfortunate turn of events, BIL's kid had a \"cool\" experience at a young age ('look at this cool, secret thing that only cool adults have!\") from a cabinet for only alcoholic beverages served in an alcoholic beverage glass.", "Yeah I can see that. I\u2019m not actually sure if vodka was his poison, I never asked because its obviously not something to ask", "The cordial came from the kitchen and the glass was on top of the cabinet, nothing like came from inside the cabinet", "Ok, the beverage was prepped at the top of the bar and  The glass is taken from the bar area, point still stands", "I mean not really, the glass wasn\u2019t secret, the cordial wasn\u2019t secret and she was showing off the glass as soon as her parents stepped in.\nThe secret part was something she made up, I never said it was secret"]}
