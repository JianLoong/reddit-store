But hear me out, as you could have avoided that situation. In a class, if a student is not understand something, it is not always the student's fault but it's the teacher's responsibility to try and find a way so the student understands, and this implies whether the student is a 5-year-old kid or a 50-year-old person. Now, how it came out, I don't think your wife was mad at you for not explaining to her, but for not having her back and letting a third person tell her how she is not able to understand stuff/simple things. You both are a Two player TEAM! Whenever and wherever and however, you have to have each other's back. So you should have stepped in there when her friend started belittling her on this, at least that is what it seems like she felt there. It is not just you who needs to do this, it's her as well whenever required. And therefore, I think she is not mad at you for NOT explaining but just not having her back. And for that, I would tell you that you're a soft AH. LOL Communication is the key. I would be inclined to say NTA if you did have her back there and she still got mad at you therefore communication is key here too! If that is how it happens, then nobody is an AH but just needs to communicate better with each other!", "crazy thing that \u201cidiot\u201d is a teacher.. time for home school", "Dory is that you?", "I\u2019m married to someone who has similar issues as the op is discussing.

That could have gone that way as well, but then it comes down to the fact of how good is OP in taking charge of the situation in this case. I am in no way saying OP is 100% wrong or he is an AH through and through, but it seemed like he just let the wolves have their way with the little lamb that was in the barn. LOL. It all comes down to him, trying not to lose patience and go about it in a different way and definitely not letting others talk down to her no matter the situation.   \nI have always made sure, that if something like this happens, I always talk to my partner about it and do not let anyone else run her down or talk down at her in any way. She does the same, and instances are more than another way around. LMAO.

I\u2019m guessing op wife just didn\u2019t like it and decided to get upset at someone for herself feeling foolish. That\u2019s why I came to the conclusion that op would of been effed either way.", "I was replying to your initial comment that you deleted in which you mentioned having her back. She wasn't being attacked! She asked a question, their friends tried to explain, and one of them got her to finally grasp it using a method OP has used before. OP didn't even say anything of the sort of \"I told you that'\" up until wifey berated him for no reason. \n\n\nOP did nothing wrong. If anything, we could say that maybe he didn't explain it as well as others but that doesn't make him an asshole. And the funny thing is that by OPs own words, the explanation that finally made it was one he had tried before. So even less of an asshole.\n\n Wife is probably just pissed off that she finally got it and has now realised how freaking easy it was to understand and yet her, a grown up teacher, didn't have the brains to get it earlier...so she deflects her embarrasment and blames husband.", "I agree. Let's hope he gets through to her! I understand I have an unpopular opinion but considering the situation, it seems to be a problem that both of them are going through and the solution seems for OP is to sit her down and tell her his feelings and make her understand it."]}
