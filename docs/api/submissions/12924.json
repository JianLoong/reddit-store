You had a father.  You miss him and no matter how good your step-dad was to you he cannot replace what you lost.  That might sting to him but as a parent, our job is to put you first, always.

It\u2019s very hurtful. Most times we just take it in the chin, which is what I suspect your stepdad has done over the years and not said anything. And internalized his pain. Until now. He has finally stood up for himself, and said something. This is the final slap in the face to him. And you turned around and cut him deep.

My daughter is super attached to her father and I suspect that attachment will get even stronger as she gets older. If anything ever happens to him I'd have a really hard time expecting her to love another man the way she loves her daddy.   \n\n\nMy sister in law's father died when she was in her early 20s and she still grieves him terribly.   \n\n\nI have an older friend who married a widower and it took her now husband's daughter quite a while to come around to the wedding even though she didn't have any problems with her dad's now wife. Interestingly, my friend insisted that she would not act as a step-mom because her husband's daughter was still grieving the loss of her mom and she didn't want to overstep.   \n\n\nIt's nobody's fault that tragedy happens, and writing someone off like this isn't fair.

I'm wondering if you're his only opportunity to have any kind of daughter-like relationship and he's trying to make it happen harder than he should.   \n\n\nI think your compromise of having both your mom and your step-dad walk you down is really sweet. I wonder if there's another way to include your step-dad without giving up your mother daughter dance. Perhaps someone with some wedding coordinating experience has an idea. We had a situation at our wedding that needed some help and someone with more experience that we had came up with (what I thought was) a brilliant solution. Perhaps do your mother-daughter dance, let your step-dad cut in briefly, then have your mom cut back in? That way it's still your dance with your mom, but your step-dad gets a little of the experience too- without taking the center stage.   \n\n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with all this. I know it's probably really hard for you to deal with and I'm sure you wish your dad could be there. If the fact that he's passed and can't be there is adding extra tension perhaps talking to your mom and letting her know how much your dad's absence is hurting you might be a bridge with her?   \n\n\nJust some thoughts that came to mind.", "Nothing wrong with your plans, but I wonder how you would feel about having your step dad walk you down the aisle, but have your mom give you away.\n\nBasically what that would like like is this:Your step dad walks you down the actual aisle, but your mom is by your fiancee and your step dad hands you off to your mom. There your mom gets the privilege of actually handing you off.\n\nLike I said, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the way you have it planned now, and by no means do you need to change it- I'm just thinking of ways to put your mom front and center while letting your stepdad also feel like he's doing some of the most important things.", "People want to simplify all this and refer to it as \u201cyour day\u201d to do what only you want, which in the grand scheme of things is true but it\u2019s not really that simple.

That means he\u2019s been there for a number of milestones throughout the majority of your life and this being the biggest of them all. In any case, you haven\u2019t clarified whether he was good to you growing up or not, but if we had to assume from his willingness to fight to be a bigger part of your wedding day, then we could say that your stepdad really does love you like his own and only wants to be there for you. For him to hear from you how he\u2019s not your real dad and how you regret asking him to walk you down the aisle after his repeated requests not only cut into your stepdad, but it might also point to something more going on here under the surface. On a side note, who\u2019s paying for your wedding expenses?", "NTA \n\nYou have always been clear that he isn't your dad. Message the 2 of them that you are shocked and disappointed that they would try to use YOUR big day to push their agenda about your real dad.

A writer tried to honor her step-dad by having him walk her down the aisle along with her late father's brother (whom she was very close to).  Then she did a dance with her step-dad.  During the dance, he steered her over to her uncle and asked him to finish the dance with her.  After it ended, step-dad came up to the bride and uncle on the floor and they group hugged.  Not a dry eye in the place after that, and I am a little misty thinking about what a selfless act it was and a nice way to honor the man that helped bring the bride into the world.\n\nWhy can't people stop putting their own delicate feelings before the feelings of the people they claim to care about?
