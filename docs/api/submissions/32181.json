Just be extroverted.\" That's a kind of gaslighting, which is manipulative and abusive. They are insisting you should and could be as they imagine you should be, rather than as you actually ARE. This imaginary \"you\" would be respected and supported by them. Actual real life you is defective where you don't match up to their imaginary version. They think torturing you by forcing you to remain in a painful environment, and increasing the uncomfortable stimuli, is appropriate punishment for your failure to be their imaginary you.\n\nDo you have access to supportive adults, through school or your family doctor?

Crying when you\u2019re overwhelmed is a natural response.  Your emotions are valid - and your family is trying to say that they are not by calling you an asshole for them.

So, please know, they are wrong for that. \nThat being said, I do think based on your description that you have some auditory processing disorders or perhaps an anxiety disorder, or that you might need to be evaluated for ASD as other commenters have said. I would look up resources on these things and would show them to your parents, too. You could also talk to your school\u2019s counselor about how you\u2019re feeling and ask them to give resources to your parents. And, by the way, none of those diagnoses are bad.

And as for their attempts at \u201cjokes\u201d, it sounds like they were trying to engage you and did the complete opposite. The moment you showed discomfort they should have stopped immediately. Also, your sister is an AH a for telling you that your reaction was out of line, because it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m very sorry your family put you down for this. You are NTA in any way but they sure are.", "I'm not OP but thank you! I get sensory overload every once in a while and it's so annoying.", "As someone who was recently diagnosed, this was my first thought as well. This experience is 110% relatable and I would feel/behave/think the exact same. I hate social gatherings \ud83d\ude43", "no why?", "And not just that. Adults really need to learn that making your kid the butt of the joke infront of the entire family is absolutely not okay and can definitely leave marks.\n\nThen they try justify it by saying \"oh it was just a joke\". Like yeah, at the expense of the kid. Glad everyone got to have a laugh though?\n\nThat one hits close to home.", "thank you", "There\u2019s a difference in not being social and being polite. Not saying maybe the other family members weren\u2019t allot but you can\u2019t just hide in your room and sit in corner and not expect it to go unnoticed.", "I have to respectfully disagree.  We do not know that OP\u2019s reaction has to do with neuro divergence.  The family was partying loudly and mocking him.  Not on him imo", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault that their family can\u2019t respect other people\u2019s space.", "oh okay thank you!", "If you\u2019re interested that might be something to bring up to your parents and may get them to back off and get you some support if you are diagnosed. Talk with your school counselor first if that helps.", "You sound so much like my fifteen year old daughter, who is on the spectrum. She was only diagnosed this year because it can be easily overlooked if you only have certain traits. l If you don't think your parents will be receptive, talk to a teacher, or your school psychologist. They can approach your parents about testing.  \n\n\nBTW, your family were being mean to you. So of course you're NTA. It can be hard for loud, boisterous people to understand people on the spectrum, or people who are just shy and don't like loud noises. Having the diagnosis could help.", "Yeah I\u2019m autistic and I have severe noise sensitivity. Definitely look into that. Also you are NTA. Wish I could say that about your family", "You also sound like you may be aromantic and/or asexual, which are also totally normal variations of human!", "You probably should get tested.   What your parents said to you is something almost ever 15 year old boy gets from family.   At least any they expect is a cis hetro male.\n\nYour reaction of what strikes me as different.", "These might actually be a good compromise! They're nearly invisible (unlike headphones) so people won't know you're wearing them. Plus they don't block all the noise, just kinda... Lower the intensity. Almost like all the background noise is in the next room, even when it's not. But you can still easily hear anyone talking directly to you.", "Just a few things you said, mainly struggling with social situations. Not getting jokes. Being overstimulated from the noise\n\nI'm obviously not sure but it's just a few traits. But if you do have it, then you could access different resources to help with stuff like this. And then your family are even bigger AHs for being insensitive", "I'm such an introvert and relate a lot to OP. I remember reading to my mum as a child and said a a word wrong. She got all my family in the room and made me read it again. They all laughed at me. I was about 10 years old. 20 years later i still remember it. His family seem like AH.", "That\u2019s what bullies do when they get called out. Suddenly everything is a joke so they can avoid accountability. \n\nI don\u2019t know if OP is on the autism spectrum as others have said but his family sounds like a bunch of bullies and enjoy making fun of him. Which is sick because parents are supposed to have your back no matter what not ridicule you.", "The family is the AH whether or not OP is neurodivergent, yes. What is there to disagree with? It looks to me like people with direct experience having Autism are saying 'what you describe here is really relatable; maybe you're Autistic, like I am. If you are, these things might help...'  If OP isn't Autistic, no harm done (maybe OP learned a bit about autism and will better relate to autistic people; pretty cool). If OP *is* Autistic, it's a welcome to a community of people who might understand him better than his family apparently do.", "I was a lot like him at 15. That was the age where I really went through all of the motions of puberty and hoo boy did I crave space, quiet, a place to process my emotions, and have zero interest in being close with anyone, especially loud relatives who ask these sorts of questions! I LOVED being alone with music on my headphones (and journaling and playing Nintendo 64 Zelda games). Feelings were intense at 15. And yes I cried pretty often too \ud83d\ude42 \n\nNot to say that these things will change and we don't know but OP may have had these feelings for years now, but just saying from having a very similar experience to the OP at age 15, this doesn't necessarily mean he has autism. Maybe he does! It's worth looking into and we should destigmatize these sorts of discussions! But a really good therapist and guidance counselor could be all he actually needs, too, adults who listen and care about what he has to say if anything at all, and those are good people to start the conversation with as referral points for further help if he needs it.\n\nFor what it's worth, I have a (non Reddit diagnosed) auditory processing disorder, which basically means that if I take in too much auditory information, I miss out on some of what's being said and my brain kinda has to play catch-up. I do better in one-on-one conversations with few to no auditory and visual distractions so I can really engage in a conversation. I'm upfront about this at work and grad school, and folks have been so accommodating and understanding once I explain that I want to listen and converse but loud environments make that difficult so I might get a little lost if too much is going on. And at 15, with all the buzzing hormones and feeling poked and prodded by relatives asking about my life, I REALLY felt overwhelmed and emotionally aggravated. Auditory disorders are often part of other mental and emotional differences, but that's not always the case.\n\nA lot could be going on. Sending solidarity and hopes that things get better, and that the family start wising up that the problem isn't that the 15 year old is too sensitive, it's their lack of being sensitive. NTA \ud83d\ude42", "This is Reddit, everybody must have a diagnosis.", "To me it doesn't sound like a respect issue, it sounds like the family don't have the full context that we do. We can clearly see that OP struggles with overstimulation and possibly neurodivergene, but to them he's  coming across as a moody teenager. In my experience, it's a pretty normal behaviour though to try to go and talk to your young family member who is sitting in the corner. And while OP is valid in his feelings, it's also a pretty normal behaviour to be asking nieces and nephews about girlfriends and boyfriends.\n\nOP finding loud and busy situations overwhelming is not his fault at all, but it does sound like coping strategies, with the co-operation of his family, would be beneficial. It would surely be to his benefit to learn how to navigate loud and busy situations (which are an inevitability of life) and also get to see his family in a way that suits him instead of getting pushed to the periphery. This is not me being invalidating or suggesting \"pushing through\" very clear sensory issues, but looking into strategies that other people with similar struggles use. \n\nIdeally, his parents would notice him struggling and take the lead, but obviously they haven't, so it sounds like a frank conversation needs to be had about OP's needs. The earphones that mask background noise sound like a great idea. Another situation could be a quieter room downstairs where OP can interact with people in smaller groups.", "Of course not, but people who suck are everywhere and learning how to deflect and redirect them is a power move.  Crying in a corner is not.", "oh okay thank you", "What about this post makes you think OPs parents would support this?\n\nMost likely he will be punished for bringing it up.", "He's 15 for heaven's sake, not everything needs a label.", "No he\u2019s fifiteen /lh", "Flare calmers are also great, and more discreet than loops.", "oh alright thank you", "Theres no better way to discourage a kid from doing something than making fun of their mistakes. Especially in front of other people.\n\nI remember I was trying to cook fried eggs when I was young. I did it successfully (or at least I thought I did) but later on, my mum told her sister about how the egg went everywhere coz I didnt heat the pan up enough and continued to laugh about it. WHILE I WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE. Both acted like I wasn't even in the room to hear it.\n\nIt sounds stupid right, but when you're young, these things stick. Like you think you did something good and then someone just shits all over it.\n\nBecause of that one little incident, I hated cooking and didnt learn how to cook properly until I was like 18.\n\nI always hoped no one would talk to me at family gatherings coz I didnt want to deal with what OP had to deal with.", "I agree with what you are saying here.  We can both have points to make. \n\nI was only pointing out that if alcohol was involved on the part of his family, and I suspect it may have been, that this young man may have simply had a very normal reaction to inherently uncomfortable situation of being around people whose judgment was impaired and whose treatment of him was insensitive.", "You\u2019re right of course - but only if his family met him for the first time at that party. It is definitely a respect issue if his parents, who have had 15 years to figure this out, are not only allowing but encouraging his sister and others to trample his boundaries. OP\u2019s issues with noise might be exaggerated by the hormones but I\u2019d bet my house they\u2019re not new.", "Talk to your school counselor.

I am sorry they are doing this to you and treating you this way. \n\nEven if you never develop romantic feelings it is nothing to laugh at anymore than if your aunt and uncle divorced, or your sister was a lesbian.", "To add: you may be asexual or aromantic. Hence why you think romantic stuff is gross", "Label let's them know it is ok if they feel that way. They aren't a freak, there are lots of people like them. \n\nIf they examine their feelings and realize they are aro or ace, that is also ok. But it is just as ok for them to not be interested in that stuff.", "Sometimes labels help. Makes you feel like less of a wierdo knowing there are others like you. Autism has a higher chance of being demisexual(no sexual attraction until a bond is formed) too.", "Maybe not but it sure helps a 15 year old to keep from feeling like they are an alien on this planet. Lets them know other people are experiencing the same things as they are and that they are actually quite normal.", "No, but being exposed to ways of existing that are different from those exhibited / normalized by OP's family can't hurt. I dunno, it seems to me that his family are doing a great job of labelling him in ways that make him uncomfortable (overly sensitive, assuming he's heterosexual, etc.)", "At 15 i also think love was stupid, he's too young , some people developed slowly than other.  But also think op can be in the spectum and need to be checked", "I knew I was asexual when I was 4, but didn't hear the word until I was 31. During the 13 years of time when I was engaging in sexual activity in an attempt to make what is different about me go away or change, I incurred an incalculable quantity of psychological, emotional, and spiritual harm that I am still working through at 38 and will likely be working through for a good deal longer. All of that lost time and opportunity to grow as a person with people who were like myself, instead of trying to force a square peg into a round hole for over a decade. I'll never get that time back or the opportunity for a do-over as a young person. \n\nReading a word won't harm him like not reading a word might.", "It can help identifying how someone feels right now. Labels can change.", "If I had had a label at 15 it would have saved me a lot of confusion.  Labels can help.  Just knowing that there is a wide range of possibilities helps", "I knew I was attracted to the same sex by the time I was 3. I was raised in a Christian conservative home and felt internalized hatred and shame even before I knew what sex was, because I was attracted to girls. This contributed to severe depression, self-harm, and suicide attempts when I was a teenager. It took until early adulthood for me to learn that what I felt was okay, and having a label and community for it was a huge help. I WISH I had that when I was 15. It\u2019s no different for asexual people.", "Have you met the average 15 year old boy? \ud83d\ude02", "Yes!

Like 90% of kids would be.", "Huh, I never really thought my demisexuality could be related to ASD. \n\nAlso OP I'm sorry you're going through this. My family were very similar when I was younger - all you can do is try to communicate that parties are overwhelming. Being able to escape to a quiet place like your room to recharge and then rejoin the party is the better alternative and what I do.
