When you say your parents wouldn't let you go to your room, did they just refuse to give you permission? Threaten you with consequences if you did leave the party? Or block you when you tried to leave? They do not have your best interests at heart. They likely don't know or care what you were going through.\n\nFind adults who can help you.

You ARE NOT \"too sensitive.\" Your coping strategies, going to a quiet private space when overwhelmed, are appropriate and valid.\n\nSadly, your family's solution to your being unusually sensitive to noise and crowding is \"Don't be that way. Just be extroverted.\" That's a kind of gaslighting, which is manipulative and abusive. They are insisting you should and could be as they imagine you should be, rather than as you actually ARE. This imaginary \"you\" would be respected and supported by them. Actual real life you is defective where you don't match up to their imaginary version. They think torturing you by forcing you to remain in a painful environment, and increasing the uncomfortable stimuli, is appropriate punishment for your failure to be their imaginary you.\n\nDo you have access to supportive adults, through school or your family doctor? Documenting your sensitivities and appropriate supports could help you get validation and support for the valuable unique person you are.", "NTA. Crying when you\u2019re overwhelmed is a natural response.  Your emotions are valid - and your family is trying to say that they are not by calling you an asshole for them. They are essentially trying to claim that you are using an emotional reaction to manipulate people, but that isn\u2019t what you were doing at all. That way of thinking is a slippery slope to dismissing your own feelings and therapy down the road. So, please know, they are wrong for that. \nThat being said, I do think based on your description that you have some auditory processing disorders or perhaps an anxiety disorder, or that you might need to be evaluated for ASD as other commenters have said. I would look up resources on these things and would show them to your parents, too. You could also talk to your school\u2019s counselor about how you\u2019re feeling and ask them to give resources to your parents. And, by the way, none of those diagnoses are bad.

The family can be the biggest bully.\n\nAnd I know a lot of people will be asking you about if you're on the spectrum or not.

I'm upfront about this at work and grad school, and folks have been so accommodating and understanding once I explain that I want to listen and converse but loud environments make that difficult so I might get a little lost if too much is going on.

And while OP is valid in his feelings, it's also a pretty normal behaviour to be asking nieces and nephews about girlfriends and boyfriends.\n\nOP finding loud and busy situations overwhelming is not his fault at all, but it does sound like coping strategies, with the co-operation of his family, would be beneficial. It would surely be to his benefit to learn how to navigate loud and busy situations (which are an inevitability of life) and also get to see his family in a way that suits him instead of getting pushed to the periphery. This is not me being invalidating or suggesting \"pushing through\" very clear sensory issues, but looking into strategies that other people with similar struggles use. \n\nIdeally, his parents would notice him struggling and take the lead, but obviously they haven't, so it sounds like a frank conversation needs to be had about OP's needs.

They do require parent consent but the school can initiate the process, and even parents who might not be very understanding when their child brings up concerns like this are often more receptive to the idea when it\u2019s brought to their attention by a school staff member. \n\nAs stated in another response to this comment, an educational qualification is far from nothing\u2014it is often HUGE and life changing, particularly for kids who have not been medically evaluated and those without supportive families. If a student qualifies, at the initial IEP meeting, the school team can explain to the parents what the child is experiencing, how this impacts them in school and social settings, what the student\u2019s needs are, and strategies to support the child\u2019s development both in and outside of school. \n\nIn-school services are generally hugely beneficial even if the family does not pursue a medical diagnosis for whatever reason, but oftentimes, an educational qualification can be what prompts parents to seek a medical diagnosis and additional supports/services for their child (like therapy) outside of school. The school team can also help connect the family with community and/or or medical resources or can point them in the right direction. \n\nThe problem with educational evaluations (which is what I suspect you might be referring to) is that the school is only legally required to conduct one if there is a demonstrated educational need\u2014so students who are doing \u201cfine\u201d in their classes rarely get evaluated without significant parent advocacy. It is also very possible to qualify for a medical diagnosis of autism but not qualify educationally (this typically happens for students who are not experiencing significant challenges in the school setting). Because of limited funding, staffing, and time, my experience has been that school districts will do all that they can to avoid an evaluation unless a student is struggling significantly in school (multiple Fs or low grades over a period of time, noticeable behavioral or social-emotional difficulties) after all other avenues have been explored and have shown little or no improvement.\n\nBUT\u2014even if a student is, on a surface level, doing \u201cfine\u201d in school, and their parents are unable or unwilling to continuously advocate for an educational evaluation, if the student does truly need help and they advocate for themselves and express their needs, a solid counselor or teacher can push for an evaluation and can be the adult who advocates for the student.\n\nI would really encourage OP to talk to a teacher they feel comfortable with and a school counselor (assuming OP is in the US). Even if staff does not refer a student for an evaluation immediately, talking to a counselor about things like OP has mentioned will put the student on their radar\u2014a good counselor will then monitor the student more closely and may refer them for an eval later down the line. Counselors can also help the student by facilitating a conversation with their parents, referring them for in-school counseling services, and helping the student learn how to advocate for themselves, to name a few.\n\nThis is based on my experience as a special education teacher who takes part in the evaluation process and conducts academic assessments for said evaluations.", "IDEA is federal law, and ChildFind applies in every state.
