My mother (63) volunteers at a sober living home for women. I respect her very much for this, and support her work, but she regularly volunteers my time and my things to help people. She is very much the sort of person that hears a problem and immediately starts trying to solve it.\n\nOne girl repeatedly violated the rules of that sober living home and was kicked out. Without telling me, she blurted out that said girl could stay with me for a few days. She has been in my home for more than 3 weeks now, and will be for at least a week more. This morning, on the way home from buying groceries, my mother told my brother to buy cigarettes for this girl. My brother's car was indisposed and so the request was kicked over to me. I have a strong aversion to this, since several close members of my family (including my grandmother, on who's death bed my mother swore to steer clear of nicotine) died of smoking-related illnesses, and whilst I did not begrudge the time or the money, I didn't feel comfortable buying them. I told her this, and she exploded, screaming at me, swearing, threatening to come and beat me bloody, etc, and calling me everything under the sun.\n\nI felt particularly aggrieved because she has already foisted this person into my home, and violated my privacy, and is now cursing at me because I won't put up the money for a product I have moral objections to. I don't care about this person smoking, and if they want to buy their own cigarettes that's fine, but I don't feel comfortable being the one physically purchasing them.\n\nShe accused me of being a self-righteous prick, and maybe I am moralising, but as far as I'm concerned I'm not saying this person can't smoke, just that I won't be part of it happening.\n\nAMTA?\n\nEdit\n\nI want to write an assurance here, because I realise my initial post probably painted my mother in an unduly negative light; Let me state this clearly -\n\nMy mother and I have survived a lot together. Going from a middle-class upbrigning to homelessness, and recovery (both fiscally and from her addiction), and watching her pull herself back from the abyss to now volunteer for a recovery program with several years sobriety behind her.\n\nShe has gone above and beyond in trying to repair her life after past mistakes, and I respect her deeply for it. I have become aware she has seen some heavier things then I feel comfortable sharing the last few days (and to people who know anything about addicts I don't think I need to) , and she has failed to seek the sort of mental care she needs to process that. That seems to have been the heaviest part of what turned her so hostile so quickly.\n\nI posted here because I felt unduly bullied by her in the moment and wasn't sure if that was a childish impulse or a genuinely justified personal issue, but I want to assure everyone here that whilst volunteering my time is something she does regularly, these incredibly caustic outbursts are a rarity (on the scale of years) and she has never physically done me harm beyond the standard corporeal punishment of an old-fashioned upbringing in childhood.\n\nI hope everyone here remembers (as I failed to in the moment, much to my chagrin) that trying to intuit someone's innermost character through the narrow window of another person's perspective on them (especially when I gave that perspective immediately after the fight and therefore at my least charitable) and through a single event is really hard.\n\nAs horrific as this incident sounds in the limited context I provided, I want to promise all of you she is not an abuser by nature, even if this incident was abusive. With regards to her over-generosity inconveniencing me, that \\*is\\* a matter of course for her, and she's recognized it. We've agreed to taking steps to improving our communication, and are moving towards professional help in communication together. I am safe, please do not worry for my physical or emotional wellbeing.\n\nI don't intend to keep up with this thread any further past this point. As far as I am concerned the matter is settled, and keeping this airing of grievances going is only going to invite me to dwell unduly on it rather than look for productive solutions to assert my independence and stand as an equal with my mother rather than let myself be led by her.\n\nI want to reiterate my thanks for your concern, and your voices of reason. I had a lot of introspection about my interpersonal relationships reading through them.", "created_utc": 1685824355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zolx7/aita_for_not_buying_cigarettes_for_an_unwelcome/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can get her own.", "Your mother is not in a position to be calling you a self-righteous prick.  Not at all. She may be a great person to the people that she's been helping, but she's being a terrible parent to you... and she beat you black and blue?  Is that literally true?  I would have reported her to the police for that! You don't have to buy cigarettes for anyone if you don't want to.  Unless you're living in your mother's home, you also don't have to let anyone live with you unless you so choose.  You need to stand up for yourself more, and take care of yourself... it sounds like you can't rely on your mother to do so. NTA", "NTA. The problem with people pleasers and those with a savior complex is that they inevitably stomp all over friends and family on their way to pleasing and saving strangers. \n\nAt this point, the answer to her requests for assistance should always be no. If she's making a promise of assistance, she needs to fulfill it on her own.", "NTA but if you aren\u2019t going to kick the unstable woman out of the house I would just buy the cigarettes because you don\u2019t want an unstable person going through nicotine withdrawal around while you sleep. I would advise kicking her out though", "NTA -  Your mom needs to keep her job out of your life. I agree with the poster that said you need to get her out, now.

Right, thank you, I need to get some wheels in motion.", "My mother doesn't have the liberty to volunteer the space she is in (her partner's, albeit not husband of many years with whom we're all on very good terms). When this girl was being kicked out my mother told me she saw her on the sidewalk with her things and nowhere to go, and said she could stay with me on a moment's pity impulse. She only after-the-fact called me whilst I was several states away doing remote work (which is an 84-work-week job!) and too tired to really object to 'ask me'. I was just so tired after a 12 hour shift I didn't understand really how to nagivate the social maze of saying 'no, my mother cannot deliver on the promise she just made, leave my house'.\n\nTo her credit, she realised immediately she'd gone too far and swore off doing this again (though she's done that before, I suppose?), and I made it clear I wouldn't allow her to do it again. After I made clear said girl was being a burden my mother started buying her food rather than just letting her plunder our fridge, but I still feel sore and intruded on.\n\nThis is really hard for me in particular because conversation and interpersonal communication, confrontation especially are incredibly difficult for me. I freeze up, stammer, and quietly nod along most of the time because I just can't really get a grasp of verbal confrontation, and I feel like she takes advantage of that to extract my after-the-fact consent with volunteering my things and time.", "My mother has a pretty strong case of emotional volatility for which she takes some mood stabilizers.

To keep this anonymous (as I've been made aware some of the people in my mother's social circle are at least aware of reddit) I'm going to avoid further disclosure here, and any specifics, but I want to assure you this is in good hands. I've contacted some people who I trust IRL to start adjusting my relationship with my mother, and working on our communication between each other. Guest will be out presently.
