My mother (63) volunteers at a sober living home for women. I respect her very much for this, and support her work, but she regularly volunteers my time and my things to help people. She is very much the sort of person that hears a problem and immediately starts trying to solve it.  \n\n\nOne girl repeatedly violated the rules of that sober living home and was kicked out. Without telling me, she blurted out that said girl could stay with me for a few days. She has been in my home for more than 3 weeks now, and will be for at least a week more. This morning, on the way home from buying groceries, my mother told my brother to buy cigarettes for this girl. My brother's car was indisposed and so the request was kicked over to me. I have a strong aversion to this, since several close members of my family (including my grandmother, on who's death bed my mother swore to steer clear of nicotine) died of smoking-related illnesses, and whilst I did not begrudge the time or the money, I didn't feel comfortable buying them. I told her this, and she exploded, screaming at me, swearing, threatening to come and beat me bloody, etc, and calling me everything under the sun.   \n\n\nI felt particularly aggrieved because she has already foisted this person into my home, and violated my privacy, and is now cursing at me because I won't put up the money for a product I have moral objections to.

You need to make this woman leave immediately before she\u2019s able to consider herself a tenant and you have to evict her. You\u2019re a grown person, your mom cannot volunteer your space for someone else. You don\u2019t owe some random person who was foisted upon you anything, much less buying them something you\u2019re understandably uncomfortable with. Cigarettes are not a necessity, and if she wants them, she can get them.", "NTA. You need to give the woman a notice to vacate and tell your mom in no uncertain terms you will not be helping her like this again and further attempts to dump strays on your doorstep will be met with a call to ur local police. Otherwise things like this will continue to happen.", "So your mother volunteered for her to live in your home?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t your mother just take her in?  That\u2019s very presumptuous of her. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\nAt all. U didnt volunteer for this, and even if u had, getting cigs is on the person, not u.\n\nHonestly i would start charging ur mom rent n groceries for this person so she understands the inconvenience she had imposed on u.", "Is she insane in some way shape or form?

Don't dither on this because in many areas if she crosses the 30 day line she becomes an at will tenant and then you're facing an eviction. Even better, pay for a week at a low cost by the week motel and drive her there tomorrow- just find one that accepts cash and don't leave your credit card on file.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Tell your mom because she threatened and insulted you you're going low contact. You'll call her once a week - ask her what day and time works- but you'll be screening her calls and texts,  she's not welcome at your home and you won't be picking up any volunteer work she tries to sign you up for. This might cause her to implode or explode- that's ok. You're retraining her how she needs to treat you if she wants to see you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Change your locks and change all your passwords. Make sure she's off all your bank accounts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) Start reading books about boundary setting and get a therapist with experience teaching boundary setting skills. Your mom is really really really out there in terms of tolerable behavior and I wouldn't be 100% she's going to be able to have an adult relationship with you but this is the way to try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) Start practicing scripts for refusing her volunteer gigs. \"That won't be possible.\" \"I won't be doing that.\" \"I'll be hanging up now and we can try to talk again next week.\" Over and over and over.

She can get her own.", "Your mother is not in a position to be calling you a self-righteous prick.  Not at all. She may be a great person to the people that she's been helping, but she's being a terrible parent to you... and she beat you black and blue?  Is that literally true?  I would have reported her to the police for that! You don't have to buy cigarettes for anyone if you don't want to.  Unless you're living in your mother's home, you also don't have to let anyone live with you unless you so choose.  You need to stand up for yourself more, and take care of yourself... it sounds like you can't rely on your mother to do so. NTA", "NTA. The problem with people pleasers and those with a savior complex is that they inevitably stomp all over friends and family on their way to pleasing and saving strangers. \n\nAt this point, the answer to her requests for assistance should always be no.

Right, thank you, I need to get some wheels in motion.", "My mother doesn't have the liberty to volunteer the space she is in (her partner's, albeit not husband of many years with whom we're all on very good terms). When this girl was being kicked out my mother told me she saw her on the sidewalk with her things and nowhere to go, and said she could stay with me on a moment's pity impulse. She only after-the-fact called me whilst I was several states away doing remote work (which is an 84-work-week job!) and too tired to really object to 'ask me'. I was just so tired after a 12 hour shift I didn't understand really how to nagivate the social maze of saying 'no, my mother cannot deliver on the promise she just made, leave my house'.\n\nTo her credit, she realised immediately she'd gone too far and swore off doing this again (though she's done that before, I suppose?), and I made it clear I wouldn't allow her to do it again. After I made clear said girl was being a burden my mother started buying her food rather than just letting her plunder our fridge, but I still feel sore and intruded on.\n\nThis is really hard for me in particular because conversation and interpersonal communication, confrontation especially are incredibly difficult for me. I freeze up, stammer, and quietly nod along most of the time because I just can't really get a grasp of verbal confrontation, and I feel like she takes advantage of that to extract my after-the-fact consent with volunteering my things and time.", "My mother has a pretty strong case of emotional volatility for which she takes some mood stabilizers. Her consistency with taking them is another matter...", "Sounds like you need to try to tell your mother that you dont want her to volunteer you for anything without consulting you first.
