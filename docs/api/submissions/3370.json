This year, 13 people total came (9 adults, two school aged children, a toddler & an infant). The guests included my brother (50s M)from out of town and  his 3 children (two in their 20s and a toddler, 3 yo).\n\nI have a dining room table with 8 seats, a breakfast room with 2 tables (1 table is adult size with 4 seats and 1 table is a toddler table with 4 chairs). Finally, there is a couch in the den with a big screen TV with a coffee table where 2-3 people could sit. The regulars know that it is free for all and they can sit wherever they want. Usually about half or so sit in the breakfast room and half or so sit in the dining room. This is my brother\u2019s first time here for Thanksgiving that I can recall in at least 5 years.\n\nAfter saying grace, I told everyone about the seating in the dining room, breakfast table area, and the den. I then directed my two school age children to the toddler table and made a seat for my brother and his 3 yo son also. So there were 3 kids and my brother at this table. I commented to my brother \u201cyou can sit next to your son so you can help him with his meal.\u201d I brought my brother his cocktail which was in the kitchen and he was helping his son eat. After everyone else got food, I made another batch of cocktails for everyone and finished heating a final item in the oven. So about 30 minutes later after everyone else had started eating, I finally fixed myself a plate and looked for a seat. I headed to the breakfast room and no one was there. My brother and his sons were done eating and were in the den on the couch watching football, so I went to the dining room where 5 people including my wife were sitting. They were all done eating, but they were socializing, so I sat there and ate my meal. After eating, I hung out in the den with my brother and nephews. As far as I knew at the time, everyone had a great time and at the end of the night, I walked my brother to his vehicle, gave him and my nephews hugs and wished them a safe trip home.\n\nWell, Saturday I got a confrontational call from my mother saying that my brother told her that I made him sit at the kid\u2019s table and \u201cwhy did you do that?\u201d  She stated that my brother was obviously bothered by this, but he didn\u2019t say anything to me about it.\n\nI might be the a-hole because I may have made my brother feel like he was not welcome to sit wherever he wanted.

I don't see any reason bro couldn't have sat at the full size table in the same room.\n\nNow, maybe he didn't mind because he would have chosen to anyway but maybe he just decided this was something he didn't think was worth picking a fight over.\n\nI think yeah, YTA for deciding for him when everyone else picked their own place.

YTA.", "YTA - \"I was just trying to facilitate his 3 yo getting help eating.\" What absolute bizarre reasoning. How does his son eat when they're at home, do you video call and make sure your brother feeds him right?", "Does your brother not have a mouth of his own? I get not wanting to say anything in front of other people because you don't want to make things awkward around the dinner table but you offered an explanation as to why he was seated there and your brother did not say anything. If my child could eat on his own and I was confident of that, then I would say \"Thank you for thinking of my kid. He actually eats meals without any help. He's such a smart kid. If it's cool, I'd like to sit with you guys. It's been 5 years so there's a lot to catch up on!\" or I would at least pulled you aside and come tell you myself that it would make me uncomfortable and have a conversation. \n\nIt's like majority of people don't know how to properly communicate with one another and that causes issues. Why is the mom the one calling to say that? Have a conversation with your brother, OP. Without your mom's involvement. Apologize if it made him uncomfortable, state it wasn't your intention, hear him out, and then you both can move on. \n\nSchool age kids can for the most part eat on their own. You can't sit a toddler at a table and expect them to be able to eat without help. You didn't single him out. You showed consideration for him so he didn't have to constantly get up and go to a fussy baby. \n\nNAH.", "NAH but next time maybe don\u2019t direct him to feed his own kid, leave that to him to sort as he\u2019s the parent, I\u2019m sure they manage just fine ensuring he has food when you aren\u2019t around", "YTA", "YTA though I don\u2019t think you meant to be.

You should have let him choose like everyone else.", "NAH, maybe N T A?\n\nI totally see that you were just trying to be helpful. It is a \"free-for-all\" but your brother has a small child, so you helped make sure he had a seat with his kid, that you assumed he wanted/needed to help eat. You even brought his drink over for him. In your mind, you were making sure he had 2 seats together with his kid. \n\nIn his mind, he was banished to the kids table.\n\nYou both have valid points of view, hence my verdict. BUT, he didn't need to wait and call your mother to complain, he could have been like \"kid is okay with the other kids\" or \"ya I have to feed him but can we sit over there?\" because adults use their words.", "[deleted]", "NTA. \n\nIf she was so concerned, why didn't she sit with her 3-year-old grandson and help him eat?

It\u2019s  not like we are talking about an actual   baby, once I  got my then 3 year old a plate, he ate pretty independently. I just don\u2019t really understand why you are seating the kids so far away. We have always put card tables in the living room by the dining room so we could all eat together. I feel you should have given a chance for your brother to have more choices about what he wanted to do instead of assigning his seat when no one else is being assigned.", "NAH, but it\u2019s odd your brother tattled to mommy.

He\u2019s responsible for making sure his toddler eats dinner & toddlers can\u2019t just sit anywhere because they make messes & cry. The day your mom or your brother play host and hostess is the day they get to have an opinion about that. If your brother can\u2019t be bothered to sit & feed his own child, then I guess he should hire a nanny to come to dinner with them, so that he can sit wherever he likes. \n\nAnd your mom needs to drop this, because she didn\u2019t offer to feed that kid either. It\u2019s not the job of school aged cousins to feed a toddler at the kids table. My only suggestion would be to tell your brother that he can bring chicken nuggies and Mac and cheese next year and feed his toddler BEFORE the real meal, so he can come sit with the adults.

He could talk with others later.", "NTA. as your intentions seem fine, but also for him to decide if the 3 year old needed help or not. Probably embarrassed him you singled him out in the group.\n\nHim complaining to your mom instead of just talking to you was also odd", "Light YTA. If his 3yo needed help I'm sure he would have helped him. Unless he has a history of pushing childcare off on others there was no need for you to single him out and make sure he sat there.

I don\u2019t know if any of you have feelings about him having another child so much later on (was it to the same partner?) but either way, at the end of the day he was a guest, one you were supposedly happy to have there, but that\u2019s not the impression he\u2019ll have had.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t exactly have brought a 3yo and expected anyone *else* to help them eat, but there\u2019s no indication he expected it; and I wouldn\u2019t let a 3yo eat alone at my place without asking, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you asked how to play it.\n\nIt sounds like you do love your brother, so I\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say this was just blockheaded of you. There\u2019s entitled guests and there\u2019s bad hosts and a whole spectrum in between; this is way closer to bad hosting. Personally, if my brother was coming for the first time in 5 years I\u2019d have ensured he wasn\u2019t spending the whole time minding his 3yo. Or I\u2019d have had a system where the 3yo who needed help could be in a high chair at the adult table - it doesn\u2019t need to be the adult sits at the baby table or the baby gets no food.\n\nBut you don\u2019t shoulder 100% of the blame for this \u2014 your whole family dropped the ball. They all ate without *you* as well. Where was your *wife*? She was supposed to be a co-host and she got all the kudos for none of the effort. It sounds like you did all the work, and nobody noticed or cared that either you *or* your brother weren\u2019t there. You were the *only* one who went in search of your brother when you\u2019d finished your food. After any one of them was done, they could have gone to help him out \u2014 in my family we do help beloved relatives with their toddlers so they can have a turn interacting with the adults, but okay, if your family doesn\u2019t do that, someone \u2014 like your wife, supposed co-host \u2014 could at least have kept him company until your little nephew was finished. Anything else is plain rude.\n\nIgnore your mother\u2019s call and reach out to your brother, because this is not about how you sat him with his toddler who needed help to eat. It\u2019s about how, after 5 years, not one of his relatives cared about catching up with him. It\u2019s about how it was his son\u2019s first Thanksgiving with the family and no one spent any time with him.\n\nI\u2019d wager that\u2019s what he expressed to your mother, and she feels ashamed but doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility, so she\u2019s put the blame on you for the milder faux pas of sticking him at the kids\u2019 table without asking. That was daft, but the dinner wasn\u2019t the whole night.\n\nI\u2019m going to say ESH \u2014 except your brother, who just did as he was told without complaint, but I can\u2019t go Y-T-A because it\u2019s definitely not just all on you. Your family sound really rude and your brother is the one you should make some effort with.", "YTA. I work with young children, 3 year olds don\u2019t need help eating, he\u2019s not a baby.

I by no means meant it that way like I'm telling you where to sit and you have no choice, but as a guest he may have thought I put much more thought into it than I did.  I would have been happy for him and his son to sit anywhere in the house including the dining room, I was really just trying to be helpful, but looks like I blew it.", "In my experience, the kids table was something you graduated to when you became social? Like a three year old in a high/chair or booster would be at the adult's table, and the six 12 year olds would be at the \"kids\" table where they could socialize about kids stuff with their peers. Usually the kids table was in the kitchen or living room, not the dining room, so that the kids didn't need to get reminded to use their indoor voices because they were drowning out the adults in the dining room trying to talk to each other. Given, in my family, \"the kids table\" wasn't really \"enforced\". Anyone who preferred to sit with the adults could do so, ect.", "Thanks for such a wise and thoughtful reply.  We are just super informal for Thanksgiving and all the regulars know that, but I can see how my brother doesn't.  I guided him the kids table but in no way felt like it was an edict.  He and his son could have sat anywhere (in my mind), but I think the point is that he didn't know/feel that.  I added in the detail that everyone had already eaten by the time I sat down to reinforce that this is normal and I was not at all bothered by it.  Usually half of the guests eat Thanksgiving dinner in the breakfast room and maybe a few in the dining room.  Just this year, more people just wanted to be fancy and gravitated towards the dining room.   My wife worked very hard for more than 6 hours on Thursday morning alone to cook and was a very active and gracious host.  My preparation of cocktails and bread was very minimal and represented less than 2.5% of the total cooking/hosting effort of my wife and mom.", "On the other hand it seems pretty weird that OP wouldn't care about eating / having dinner with his brother who has been away for 5 years.\n\nMistakes do happen and I like to show more nuance than this sub does but going out of your way to do it in the first place is already odd, let alone the 5 years thing. Their mother interpreted it as a swipe.\n\nUnless we hear someone else's perspective I don't think there's any way to make much of a judgement on OPs intentions. I've met people who will do this kind of very slight thing on purpose but at the same time everyone is guilty of making silly decisions like this sometimes.", "He is my older brother and I by no means have it in my mind that he would for a second do what I say/recommend against his will/happiness.  \n\nI literally put no thought into more than this:  His son is small, this table is small, his son will be more comfortable at this table, let's sit him there.  I then directed my two school age kids to sit there too even though they usually sit at the bigger breakfast table.", "It\u2019s the \u201cunbeknownst to him\u201d part that makes YTA, but lightly.

Did you think he couldn\u2019t decide whether his kid needed help eating by himself?", "So, everyone else was told to eat wherever they want but your brother gets sent to the kiddie table? Im floored. YTA", "NAH.  This is a breakdown in communication and that is all.  OP needs to call his brother and apologize.  When my son was 3 I preferred to sit with him if the area was carpet or rugs to avoid a cranberry stained mess.  But to be fair my kid got about 50 percent in his mouth at 3.\n\nOP was trying to make it easier for his brother.  However, next time maybe sit down with your brother.  He hadn't been home for 5 Thanksgivings.  I am sure he wanted to catch up.  No better time than when kids mouths are full of food.  \n\nBrother should have called OP next day instead of mom.  It sounds like he would have gotten an apology right away.  Other than that kudos to him for not making a scene and being an adult.", "YTA", "YTA - next time maybe ask if his son needs help and then leave it at that", "[removed]", "ESH. The toddler should have had a high chair. The brother could have sat with the child on his lap at the adult table. There were other options. Logistically, there were better solutions.", "Nice, NTA\n\nYou did not wrong.\n\nYou had good intentions.", "Maybe that's why he needed to sit at the kids table. Had to run to mommy yo cry about it. Lol", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I wish AITA had a category for \u2018you were the AH in this question\u2019 vs \u2018you sound like an absolute AH overall\u2019.", "Fair enough (re: your wife\u2019s hosting), but for the rest of it \u2014 yes, it\u2019s not entirely on you. You\u2019re right what you say here, you can see why your brother wouldn\u2019t know the drill. But it\u2019s not clear why no one but you could tell him. If your mom was partly hosting, that makes it extra odd that she didn\u2019t make more of a fuss of her son who was there for the first time in 5 years, and her 3yo grandson \u2014 you\u2019d at least think she\u2019d notice he wasn\u2019t at the dinner table with anyone else.", "3 year old know how to feed themselves", "YTA. So\u2026every other adult got to choose their own seat\u2026but your brother is somehow incapable of choosing his own seat because he has a 3 year old (?) Super controlling on your part. Your brother has 2 other adult kids\u2026why do you think he needed your \u201cfacilitation\u201d to figure out how and where to feed his kid?", "YTA\n\nI can see why your brother doesn\u2019t come over more often. Everyone else sat where they wanted while you made him watch your kids. That must have been exciting dinner conversation for him. Plus you assumed he wouldn\u2019t be able to set him and his child without your help, which is pretty insulting.\n\nYou didn\u2019t just make him feel not welcome to sit where he wanted. You made him feel not welcome, period.", "You could have also just not had a designated kids table, given there were only two other kids (not counting the infant, who obviously would not be in a regular seat at any table) and they were both yours."]}
