They left you to be raised by other people for almost half your life, and in my view they have forfeited any moral rights or expectations that they may have once had, to be seen as your parents.\n\nI *wouldn't* say that you don't miss them and have no interest in seeing them. The less they feel that it's a competition between them and Pete + May, the less likely they are to make things difficult for you. But do tell them you're very happy and settled where you are and don't plan to move back to the city - and that they are welcome to visit you at the ranch.\n\nAlso speak to Pete + May and make sure they understand how you feel. They may assume that you want to go back to your birth parents.\n\nEdit: I'm pretty shocked that your parents would leave you for 7 years to go travelling, but honestly I'm more shocked that they think they can just waltz back into your life and pick up where they left off. Life just doesn't work that way.", "NTA, Sorry but they abandoned you. \n\nOnce you decide to have children, it is for life. You can't take a break from it (for 7 years !). \n\nAnd now they can't force you to separate from your actual parents, the people who raised you... Ask Peter and May if they would be ok keeping you and go see a lawyer asap !", "What is this?\n\nIt doesn't make sense, they left you at 10 years old for seven years to go travel? \n\nCome back when your basically grown and almost at the age where you leave home anyway or go off to college and they what? Want to live with you again for one year?\n\nIs this fake?", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut realize this: **Pete and May are who you have to discuss this with: THEY are your real parents.** ... your bio parents abandoned you years ago, they don't really care about you.", "NTA at this point those people are not your parents. It takes a lot more than blood and a few postcards and calls here and there to be a parent.  it sounds like Pete and May are your parents -be where you feel safe, comfortable, and loves-that doesn\u2019t always mean with blood relatives. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t imagine how they even think that makes sense -if they missed you so much they would not have left you for years -they would have stayed or figured out how to include you b/c there are people that travel the world with their children -regardless of age.", "NTA, i myself live in the city, and i went to france during the spring in a quite country-side esc area, and i loved it. the world feels so calm and so at peace its unbelievable. i wish i couldve stayed there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni dont think telling your parents how you feel is at all a bad thing. they should accept how you feel and if its okay with pete and may, you should stay :)", "NTA. You're clearly not a prioroty in their life. Why give up an ideal life for a life you don't want with parents who would rather travel than be with you. You were basically abandoned and are 17 so legaly maybe there's nothing they can do about it.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents left you for SEVEN YEARS? They had a child, and just decided not to be parents anymore because they wanted to travel for 7 years straight?? Is that right? \n\nOf course you don't miss them! Traveling in such an extensive way should have been done BEFORE having a kid... when you have a child, that person should become priority number one. Tell them the truth; they no longer are mom and dad to you. They passed on this role to other people who have done an admirable job.", "NTA --- Have a sit down with Pete and Mary and ask them if it is OK if you continue to live with them and if they agree then tell your parents that you like the life and lifestyle that you have on the ranch and therefore you have decided like they did when they went on their world trip that you are going to stay put.", "Wow this is a lot to unpack. First of all you WNBTA if you stayed where you are. I do not understand your parents, having kids means that you don't get to do whatever you feel like because you try to do whatever is best for your children. Going on a 7 year old trip and passing off your child is not one of them. You grew roots in the meantime and you are old enough to make your own decisions.", "When they come back to town, you and all the adults need to sit down and discuss your Matilda like situation. I hope your parents just sign over rights to Pete and May. At the very least, you can tell your parents that when you turn 18, you will return to their ranch. I'd talk to Pete and May first and ask if it would be okay to come back at 18 to be a live-in ranch hand. If they say no, then it is what it is, but I feel like with how attached you all are, everything should work out hopefully. NTA", "NTA.. Your parents left you during, what I would say, are some of the most important years of your life. You developed as the person you\u2019ll be during the years your parents pawned you off on other people so they could travel child free.", "NTA\n\nSpeaking up now would be the best option. Waiting any amount of time will just makes things more complicated. \n\nDo talk to Pete and May first. Let them know you feel and what you want. At 17, what you want does matter, and honestly, when you turn 18 you don't need permission from your parents anyway.", "7 years ago? \nHell no!!!!! \nPlease talk to Pete and May and get their blessings to stay.", "NTA. It's natural for you to feel hesitant about uprooting your life and leaving behind the lifestyle you've come to love.", "Actually you can call the police and say that you were abandoned by your parents and that Peter and may were put in charge of you temporarily. Because I don\u2019t think that the court would find that funny one bit and technically by state law if your parents been gone for seven years then that is child abandonment", "NTA, not at all. I'm very sorry to say it: seven years was nearly half your childhood - your parents raised you halfway and decided to abandon you for their own pleasures. How dare they try to waltz back in after this? As long as it's okay with Pete and May, you should stay with them if they make you happy.", "You're in a similar position to my mother, but she was younger. She went on a trip with her father to visit friends on a farm and was left there. Her father died during the war, and  5 years later her widowed mother brought her back to live in the multi generational house in the city. She never really forgave hey mother for bringing her back.", "NTA have you asked your guardians what they think?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If so Tell them you want to stay, tell them what you will do to be a productive adult(and not just enjoy their largesse).\n\nAt 17, I imagine that any court case you take on (emancipation?)--if your parents force you to go that route, will likely take enough months that you'll hit 18 before it's settled.\n\nWhat will you do when you are 18? Do you have a plan in mind.

A child is not something you put down and pick up at your convenience.\n\nYou're 17. You get to decide. They aren't your guardians legally or morally, and you can tell them no. They forfeited the right to be your parents when they disappeared for seven years. If they want a place in your life, they need to earn it back. Starting with funding you having a seven year holiday free of all responsibilities.", "7 years!! If they wanted to travel they should of done so before they had you or waited the 18 years until your an adult, your definitely NTA.", "They passed on this role to other people who have done an admirable job.", "A year is long and one thing if you don\u2019t Wang to interrupt schooling. But 7 years with a phone call? I wonder what the friends think of this arrangement. OPs parents basically abandoned them, and not wanting to move for the last year in high school makes a huge amount of sense.", "It's kindda crazy. They abandoned OP at 10 years old...they basically passed 7 years of parenting onto someone else and only came back when she's also an adult.\n\nKind of reminds me of rich people that ship their kids off to boarding schools at age 6 till they 18 and then are suprised their kids have no connection to them.", "I wish I was making it up honestly, I know it doesn't make any sense. I can't understand why you'd even want have children if you're not going to be around anyway. What would be the point?", "I (together with Pete and May) have already been looking at attending an online college after I graduated, so I could earn a degree while still living with them. I've grown so attached to them, the horses, the ranch and the general area that I just really can't imagine leaving for any extended amount of time, so going to college to stay in a dorm hasn't really been something I've been interested in. \n\nAnd it was a surprise for sure. I'm not sure what kind of communication Pete and May have had with my parents during these seven years. I can't imagine they approve the way my parents have dealt with all this, and I suspect they kept their opinions to themselves for my benefit.", "IF it weren\u2019t for video calls and overseas postcards I\u2019d almost think they were in jail or something and kept this a secret. It\u2019s insane. I\u2019m amazed Pete and May agreed to it,", "It does sound as if it was Pete & May's plan for you to stay there.
