The less they feel that it's a competition between them and Pete + May, the less likely they are to make things difficult for you. But do tell them you're very happy and settled where you are and don't plan to move back to the city - and that they are welcome to visit you at the ranch.\n\nAlso speak to Pete + May and make sure they understand how you feel.

First of all you WNBTA if you stayed where you are. I do not understand your parents, having kids means that you don't get to do whatever you feel like because you try to do whatever is best for your children.

You grew roots in the meantime and you are old enough to make your own decisions.", "When they come back to town, you and all the adults need to sit down and discuss your Matilda like situation.

I'd talk to Pete and May first and ask if it would be okay to come back at 18 to be a live-in ranch hand. If they say no, then it is what it is, but I feel like with how attached you all are, everything should work out hopefully. NTA", "NTA..

I'm very sorry to say it: seven years was nearly half your childhood - your parents raised you halfway and decided to abandon you for their own pleasures.

Given that they would have been unlikely to be able to legally work in all of those non-US countries, they\u2019d have had to have some serious money to sustain that kind of extended travel, and *nothing* we\u2019re being told points to that. (If nothing else . . . If they had that kind of money, she wouldn\u2019t *have* to give up her horse \u2014 and the friends wouldn\u2019t have had to give it to her.)\n\nThe other alternative would seem to be that they\u2019ve been in the Peace Corps or working for the government in some (possibly classified) capacity. But, one way or another, OP, you are not being told the whole story here.\n\nYou are NTA for wanting to stay put. In fact, I suspect it might be the very wisest thing you could possibly do. I wish you the very best and hope that you have a very happy life living with your horse and the family who raised you. Other than to stay put, the only piece of advice I can offer is to never give up your horse for a man, either. I gave mine up for my first husband. It was very much the *wrong* decision.\n\nGood luck. Be well.", "It counts, just not as much as a fun vacation. Speaking of, y'all really should take one if you can afford it, you're mental health will thank you. 10 years is entirely too long without a decent break.", "Dont be embarrassed - we've all done it!", "If anything had happened to her it would habe drawn attention to their location. It would have been safer at her friends.", "They could have been stranded in a foreign country during that time. \n\nBut I really hope it's prison, because the idea of abounding your child for 7 years like it's nothing sounds horrible to me.", "Yes, starting at about 8 we would take my son to the gate and put him on a plane w/ the attendants aware of him.  My best friend would receive him at the other end.  Her son & my son were the same age & grew up together, so when they moved away we would always send them for visits.  My son loved the independence and it gave him a passion for travel.", "Young bad, me stupid /s", "Even the most loving parents-by-choice wouldn't be so charitable. Keeping their negative feelings hidden from the OP puts them in sainthood category.\n\nI can't wait for the bios to accuse Pet and May of alienation of affection for being decent people.", "That we can't speculate behind. Maybe they couldn't have kids and this was their opportunity. They may not have any negative feelings towards her, it sounds like she's been a great help around their ranch.", "Are your parents religious? Missionaries? Cultists? On the run from the law? Part of the witness protection program?\n\nI\u2019m genuinely curious as to why someone would leave behind their 10 year old kid with friends. All the ordinary reasons I can think of has to do with religion or legality.", "But they didn\u2019t want to buy her a plane ticket.", "I'd even understand... one year. \n\nBut that's like for work. Like if they were both soldiers or astronauts and they were sent on a mission. \n\nThen yes, I could understand making the choice to temporarily leave your child with loved ones. \n\nBut for traveling? And for seven years?! That's unconscionable. I don't understand how any parent would be comfortable with that.", "The thing is, it\u2019s not \u201c7  years to bring them to trial,\u201d but 7 years (or however long, it varies) to *file charges*. After charges are filed, there\u2019s no bright-line limit. So if the parents committed a crime, the crime was uncovered, and they were indicted, then they could have been on the Moon for seven years, it isn\u2019t going to get the charges tossed. \n\nCivil lawsuits are different, but usually also have exceptions to the statute of limitations if the person is out of state and can\u2019t be served with the lawsuit. \n\n(What about the right to a speedy trial? If criminal charges are filed, you do have the right to a speedy trial, but that\u2019s a hard argument to win unless (or even if) it\u2019s really egregious. And it\u2019s basically not going to work if you\u2019ve been out of the country because it\u2019s *your* fault you didn\u2019t have a trial. If you had come back sooner and said, \u201ctry me!\u201d then you could claim lack of a speedy trial.)\n\nOf course, the parents may have misunderstood the rule, or gotten bad legal advice, or just left the country because they\u2019re the sort of people who think it\u2019s fun to travel even if it means rehoming your child.", "Or, if they really were abroad and moving around to avoid criminal indictment in the US, they might have been \"working\" in some capacity to keep afloat.", "But how would they BOTH be on the line at the same time? They would be at different prisons, even if they could coordinate a call between the 2 of them at once, outgoing calls from a prison often have a recording saying something like \"this is a call from blankety-blank prison messaging rates may apply do you accept the charges\"\n\nAlso at 10 years old if they were on the wrong side of the law about to go to jail wouldn't CPS or SOMEONE be involved?\n\nShe also said they sent her postcards, how exactly would they get a \"wish you were here from belize\" card? Let alone send it out as all mail coming and going is looked at before it goes anywhere.\n\nand if they had video calls they couldn't exactly put up a fake backdrop, they also again couldn't both be on the video call at once unless it was 2 separate screens even then they wouldn't be able to believably make a fake backdrop or something that would make it seem they were in the same place. They would also be in prison jumpsuits to the best of my knowledge.", "Damn. Maybe they're coming back not only for their kid, but to dig up the jewels from the Vegas heist, that  they buried in the desert seven years ago.", "What in the hallmark movie bullshit am I reading right now", "It\u2019s probably the plot of a hallmark horse girl movie OP saw last night", "Stayed where they were? Coming back is also travelling.", "Multiple people I follow on Youtube (sailors and travelers) were stuck in foreign countries for months and months in remote locations because of lack of access to vaccines and the lock downs.  They could have been stuck anywhere really.", "10 to 17 were my very favorite years watching my son grow up.  all the drama of the adolescent years & being able to help him out by remembering the stuff that made me so awkward at that age & trying to help him be different.  He's got such great memories from those years too.  We say, our scars were his reward.", "I mean, they could in theory, but would they?  They \u201cmissed her\u201d and could afford to spend seven years traveling but could never afford to buy a plane ticket for her to visit them (or to visit her)? \n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine they would go overnight from \u201ccan\u2019t be bothered to visit\u201d to total legal war. \n\nAs strange as this story is, the \u201con the lam\u201d theory seems the most likely to me. If the parents care for her at all, they should be willing to let her stay in her current safe, stable, and loving home.\n\nI\u2019m a mom of two. 10 is an awesome age. There is no age at which I would have been willing to give my children up. My teenagers are amazing and I absolutely love being with them. When they leave for college I will miss them terribly. This story is crazy to me.", "Somewhere on these internets is a document published a while back that was a complete guide to how servants should set up one of Jeffrey Epstein's and Ghislaine Maxwell's houses for their stay there. It ran to many pages and was niggling and obsessive about tiny details to a remove-the-brown-M&Ms extent. And Epstein/Maxwell weren't really billionaires, they probably just blackmailed and/or pimped for them. It's now apparent that too much money has some sort of brain-eating effect on humans.", "Yeah, nothing custody wise is likely to happen at OP's age. \n\nA teenage in-law of mine got orphaned by COVID 4 months before his 18th birthday. He was responsible with keeping the house clean and doing his virtual learning, so we left him be with periodic grocery drop-offs and check-ins while we sorted out his younger sister. Well, this youth pastor started going on about calling Social Services about him. We ended up talking to a lawyer and she said he'd age out before this pastor would be able to do anything.", "Oh for sure- They have not just been video calling and living a dream life. If they were travelling for seven years and can afford to than they'd bring her along, happily. Rich parents include their children and boast. They also hire travel nannies.\n\nI deduce that they were in the Witness Protection Program- 100%. Calling when it was approved and monitored by an agent and filtered through multiple IP address sources. If they were calling from the jail than OP would hear the jail prompt at the beginning and end of the calls. Children of parents in the program are given to family friends living in rural locations if/when possible.\n\nI also guess that OP would have googled her name and parents' names at least once- like most kids do. Even more so because they're absent. If the parents had records they would have popped up in public records during the Google search. However, in the Witness Protection Program nothing comes up at all.", "OP stated she video called them. I doubt prisons allow that!", "I thought the same! Who does this? Something happened . Did they ever visit you?", "The prison theory sounds the most plausible so far. I really hope the OP does keep us updated, and that this has a happy end for them.", "Honestly, this would have been an awful life for a child. Even if they are horrible people making illegal choices, this would compound the issue so much.\n\nThe kid would never be settled. The kid would never have an education. The kid would potentially be put into a system, maybe in a foreign country, if they were extradited.\n\nGiving OP a stable life is the least they could do. The very, very least.", "Poor kids. I hope he and his sister are both doing well now.", "Good point.", "The stories about witness protection I've read, is they keep the family together, though it's tough on kids. But I suppose it's possible, and these \"friends\" are part of the program to watch the kid.", "They're from Chicago. My money is on ties to organized crime, and on the run from the Feds.", "Not sure where you're at but if you're in Montana and love horses look into Rocky Mountain College [https://www.rocky.edu/](https://www.rocky.edu/)\n\nIt's a great little college with a tremendous [Equine Studies program](https://www.rocky.edu/equestrian) as well as a strong [Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA) Team](https://www.rocky.edu/campus-life/clubs-activities/clubs/ihsa-equestrian-team).\n\nApply there and stay with Pete and May.", "Are you 100% sure they were actually travelling and not in jail? I just cant fathom anyone abandoning a 10 year old and never visiting ever again. They've missed almost half your life. They're strangers at best", "Could they be spies or something crazy like that - maybe I've seen too many movies right. \n\nNTA at all, this is just bizarre. Your parents are very strange. Perhaps you could get emancipated or approach the people who actually cared for you for advice and options. I wish you the best sweetheart.", "Normal parents would have wanted to share interesting world locations with their child. There's no innocent explanation for just leaving a child with someone else for seven years while you travel -- at best you're a monster of selfishness.", "Oh no, they were international double agents and now they're finally coming in from the cold!", "And it's still hard to believe the big Covid lockdown of 2020 was three years ago", "I can't speak for all of that? But my grandparents did all of my parenting without being my legal guardians until I was fifteen (when they legally adopted me). My mom was around but just didn't. So long as my mom set it up, they could do most anything. She told the schools to contact them first, they did. (In fact, I had a teacher for two years who thought my mom was dead or not in my life. Her face when she asked if the woman who'd come along for parent teacher night was my sister and I said she was mom was priceless) She gave permission, they could go as chaperones on field trip, parent teacher nights and meetings, etc.\n\nThey took me to doctors' appointments too. Usually they just had to have a signed letter from her on file giving permission, and things were fine. If I went to a new doctor or a specialist they needed a new note.\n\nSo it's possible, if they still had contact, the parents might have given schools/doctors/etc permission to contact them instead, and done letters over email/fax/however it's done now. Course it could be changed now, that was 2005-2015. Or they could have signed guardianship over, that's possible. As for taxes I have no idea."]}
