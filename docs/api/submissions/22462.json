The less they feel that it's a competition between them and Pete + May, the less likely they are to make things difficult for you. But do tell them you're very happy and settled where you are and don't plan to move back to the city - and that they are welcome to visit you at the ranch.\n\nAlso speak to Pete + May and make sure they understand how you feel. They may assume that you want to go back to your birth parents.\n\nEdit: I'm pretty shocked that your parents would leave you for 7 years to go travelling, but honestly I'm more shocked that they think they can just waltz back into your life and pick up where they left off.

First of all you WNBTA if you stayed where you are. I do not understand your parents, having kids means that you don't get to do whatever you feel like because you try to do whatever is best for your children.

You grew roots in the meantime and you are old enough to make your own decisions.", "When they come back to town, you and all the adults need to sit down and discuss your Matilda like situation.

I'd talk to Pete and May first and ask if it would be okay to come back at 18 to be a live-in ranch hand. If they say no, then it is what it is, but I feel like with how attached you all are, everything should work out hopefully. NTA", "NTA..

I'm very sorry to say it: seven years was nearly half your childhood - your parents raised you halfway and decided to abandon you for their own pleasures.

This isn't legal advice, but you are under a year away from being an adult.  The second you're 18, \"kiss my [white|black|brown] ass\" is a full and complete response to any demand your parents make of you.  While technically you're a minor now and your parents could -- highly theoretically -- get police to help them forcibly take custody of you, the closer that date becomes, the less interested any police agency will be in making you obey your parents.  Given the additional context -- ie you haven't seen these people in 7 years while they've been in prison (my guess) or they just ditched you to go do whatever -- there's almost no chance a police agency or anybody else will force you.\n\niow, they're making requests to which, esp if Pete and May agree, you can simply say no.", "INFO - how old are your parents? \n\nI could be completely off, but maybe they are thinking about the future and how they'll want you to take care of them in their old age. \n\nI really hope not the reason for wanting you to live with them, but I've heard those stories before. \n\nPlus IF they really missed you,  they'd have called every day, not once a week, or not at all but sent a post card with 30 words, or whenever it was convenient for them. \n\nThey are selfish,  self-serving, self-centered people. They really don't care about you. \n\nHad they sent you a birthday gift each year?  Something they picked out and mailed to you from whatever county they were in?  Did they send a Christmas gift? What about turning 13 or sweet 16?\n\nThey don't care that you don't know them - they are basically strangers.  They don't care that you'd be giving up your entire world you created and lose your friends by moving in with them.  You don't even know what kind of rules they'd expect you to learn and follow which will be different from the loving home you have now. \n\nThey expect you to sacrifice everything so they don't have to.\n\nIf they've been traveling the world,  did they finance their travels by working remotely? Even if they weren't,  its not for you to move to them. Then can move closer to you. \n\nYour have loving patents and you have no idea what to expect from your bio parents. And how long before the travel fever gets them again and they leave you again. Do you want your life upheavaled again? \n\nTell your parents that you're happy where you are.  You have friends and a life right where you are.  That you have no intention of uprooting yourself for a year and then uprooting again for college or a tech school.\n\nYou'd love if they came to visit and you could rebuild a relationship with them. \n\nTalk to Pete and May so they know what's going on and know that you want to continue living with them. \n\nEvery child and teen needs stability, guidance,  support,  and love. Your bio parents did not provide these things to you.  Your parents you live with have. \n\nYour bio parents did do one thing right - selecting Pete and May was the best thing they did do for you. Give them credit for that. \n\nThey became your guardians,  if it was a legal document they all signed, \n read over the terms. See what conditions there are if any. \n\nHave you asked Pete and May if they ever reminded your parents to call? \n\nNTA at all.  And it's okay to say your not moving.

That would explain a lot.", "Also they could have gotten stuck somewhere due to Covid lockdowns", "They're making a joke.", "I'd love to hang out with my kids - that would be great.

They could be back because it is either sorted out legally through proxy or the statute of limitations is up. Also, entirely possible that they lost all their money and were trying to shield their daughter from the consequences, but they'd have at least visited her if that was the case.", "Yeah, that sounds right to me (as a criminal attorney). I was thinking MAYBE if the best friends/guardians tried really hard they could manage to do all the logistics without op realizing why (esp. if the vetting etc happened when op was still 10), but that seems implausible at best. More likely totally impossible.", "At least in my state, there's a tag right on the screen that says Department of Corrections, with the inmate's name and DOC number.  It helps make it harder for anyone on the outside to hack the image and do things with it.

So them always calling separately with different backgrounds would be a massive red flag.", "There are many countries in those ares where extradition would be very unlikely or simply impossible.
