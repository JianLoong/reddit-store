The less they feel that it's a competition between them and Pete + May, the less likely they are to make things difficult for you. But do tell them you're very happy and settled where you are and don't plan to move back to the city - and that they are welcome to visit you at the ranch.\n\nAlso speak to Pete + May and make sure they understand how you feel. They may assume that you want to go back to your birth parents.\n\nEdit: I'm pretty shocked that your parents would leave you for 7 years to go travelling, but honestly I'm more shocked that they think they can just waltz back into your life and pick up where they left off.

They had a child, and just decided not to be parents anymore because they wanted to travel for 7 years straight?? Is that right? \n\nOf course you don't miss them!

First of all you WNBTA if you stayed where you are. I do not understand your parents, having kids means that you don't get to do whatever you feel like because you try to do whatever is best for your children.

You grew roots in the meantime and you are old enough to make your own decisions.", "When they come back to town, you and all the adults need to sit down and discuss your Matilda like situation.

I'd talk to Pete and May first and ask if it would be okay to come back at 18 to be a live-in ranch hand. If they say no, then it is what it is, but I feel like with how attached you all are, everything should work out hopefully. NTA", "NTA..

I'm very sorry to say it: seven years was nearly half your childhood - your parents raised you halfway and decided to abandon you for their own pleasures.

I\u2019ve known him and trusted him more than most people in my life. Stick with who you can trust.", "Wow your parents are neglectful and huge AHs.\n\nI am shocked that people could abandon their child for 7 years.  It would not have been so difficult to wait until you had left home/went to collage.\n\n I hope that Pete and May are ok with you saying longer, until you can afford to leave.  I assume that your parents sent funding for your upkeep, which now might stop", "NTA. You were abandoned seven years ago. I would be suspect they have been 'traveling the world' for seven years.\n\nStart the conversation with Pete and May. As you said, they are your parents now. Tell them you are hesitant to see your bio-parents and explain why.

No way.\nTell them that just like no one needs to go traveling for 7 years, you don't need horses but you prefer them so you are staying home with your family.", "NTA Plenty of people care for kids on their #vanlife world trips. Your parents did not want to be parents. Now that you are old enough to fend for yourself, they are ready to take back the title without having done the hard work. Stay where you want to be.", "No kinda about it, they abandoned you, for 7 years, if the friends have guardianship and you are almost an adult I don't think you parents have much of a chance to enforce this.\nHas you talk with your guardians wich at this point I would say are more parents than your bio ones. Even if your parents fight this legally in the time in get through everything you will be adult an able to choose.", "I somehow missed that they were gone SEVEN YEARS until I got to the end, but sure enough it\u2019s in the first sentence of the post.\n\nHonestly this requires alot of conversation, with Pete and May and your parents. \n\nINFO: Have you asked Pete and May how they feel about it?", "OP- NTA. \n\nYour parents abandoned you at the age of 10. There\u2019s a whole load of experiences a child goes through from the ages 10 to 17 and they missed all of it - regardless of calls and letters. Unlike a parent who may miss their child\u2019s growing because they have to work - and that does unfortunately happen - they CHOSE  to do so. Unless they had A REALLY good reason like imprisonment (like someone else commented, postcards could be faked, video calls not so much if these were all made in different places and clearly not somewhere where they were incarcerated (and men and women aren\u2019t kept together in prisons either)), they basically decided that their desire for having a childfree life was more important than their flesh and blood child. Did they even pay their friends for your upkeep?\n\nAnyway- you\u2019re 17. You\u2019re basically going to be an adult soon. In most courts in the US, you\u2019d probably be asked if you wanted to rejoin your parents if it ever goes that far, so I\u2019d say tell them no and that you don\u2019t wish to rejoin them. Tell them that you have your school to finish (maybe senior year - especially that can be hard if you change schools that late), your uni applications to do, you have friends and loyal family there. It sounds harsh, but hey - they chose it! Be ready that they will buckle and cry and probably try to guilt trip you and maybe even use the \u201cwe\u2019re your parents, lady - you listen to us\u201d. Either way - state your decision to them IN WRITING that you can reproduce (email, text), so that you\u2019ve told me that you refuse and don\u2019t want to join them (who are, essentially, strangers to you now).\n\nAnd if they start being mean, involve local social worker and/or police (or whoever deals with these things). You\u2019re still underage, hence why it may be best to include someone who works with underage services. Either way, prep your documents - that they willingly and knowingly left you with these people and have taken no active role in raising you and that you have settled in that life and have friends and school to think about.", "NTA .

They stopped being you parents when they left you behind.", "NTA. Your parents didn't just drop you off for a couple months. They abandoned you for *7 years.* Talk to Pete & May about how you feel.

And I doubt any court would look favorably on the fact that your parents skipped out on you for 7 years.", "Nta. You were a throwaway to them. Also technically you will be an adult in a year.

Their bio parents abandoned her by all intents and purposes", "To answer these questions:\n\n1. I honestly don't know. I'll have to ask later. I honestly never really thought about that.\n2. They never visited. From the postcards I got they pretty much went to a new country every few weeks or so. I got cards from a lot of Asian countries, Middle-Eastern countries, South-American countries, etc.", "I wish I could understand their thought process really. From what I understood, they did do a lot of backpacking through various countries, and basically never stayed anywhere longer than a few weeks. I have no idea what they actually did during their trip other than going to places though. I figured they'd just be mingling with the locals and experiencing the countries, but honestly it could be anything at this point.", "Almost half of your life has been with these beautiful horse people.", "Hmm, I'm thinking the bio-parents need something from you, like free labor or maybe a kidney.
