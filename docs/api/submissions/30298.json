Life's tough, and wearing the big girl pants means dealing with the not-so-fun stuff like chores and job hours.  \nThe whole situation with your ex? Ugh, that was not a level playing field. It\u2019s like trying to play tug of war with someone who\u2019s got a monster truck against your Mini Cooper - not really a fair match, is it? But you did your best with what you had, and girl, that's all any of us can do.  \nNow, Maria storming out and throwing the \"bad mother\" grenade? That's her lashing out because she\u2019s been served a reality check with a side of \"actions have consequences\" for maybe the first time in her life. It stings, but maybe it's the wake-up call she needs.  \nThe door you\u2019ve left open for her is a gateway to grow up, not just a free bed. You're teaching her that to dance in the rain, you gotta learn to weather the storm (and maybe clean up a little after it). It's okay to stand your ground, and it's okay to expect her to step up.  \nThe tough love bandwagon isn't a joyride, but sometimes it's the only way to the destination of self-respect and responsibility.

If they end up wanting to further education and get a better job, they will choose to after realizing most jobs that make a decent living will take higher education. The partying lifestyle will slowly become a normal amount if she ends up taking the responsibilities that you\u2019ve laid out; honestly she\u2019s young and should be allowed to explore and socialize without your control unless it\u2019s an actual issue.

Yes, she's technically an adult and 21. However, she is only in this situation because of her father enabling her choices and you essentially abandoning her.

You need to help her get there, and it won't be easy for either of you now that she's older. Whatever happened between you and her dad for you to absolutely give up on trying with her is a true shame. You failed her as much as her father failed her. I'm appalled at all the others saying this is a reasonable reaction. \n\nYes, some of the rules are reasonable and necessary to establish boundaries, respect, etc., but you need to ease her into this.

If she is a full time student working more than 20 hours could be seriously detrimental to her studies. The partying thing is also iffy depending on what you mean. She should still be free to spend time with friends and enjoy her youth, but if it incorporated major substance abuse or brought issues into the home or negatively impacted her studies or work I could understand, just be willing to have some flexibility because fun is actually super necessary for maintaining a healthy mind and functioning intellectually. It also doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re seeing your daughter as a human being and very recently literal child that was manipulated by her father and his shiny things and permissive nature.

She needs to love her daughter, and teach her to choose an adult life like she should have done when her kid was younger.", "If she has the capacity to be a competent bank teller she surely has the capacity to just *get her GED*.", "Of course anyone can end up choosing a career with hours like you have. But it's a choice. You could have a regular 9-5 most likely, right? My SIL, an RN, chose like you did...but she gets 3-4 days off each week so it works out nicely for her and she likes it.\n\nI doubt OPs daughter will have that same choice.", "My thought about this is that it's usually push-and-pull. Children who have a genuinely good relation with their parents (or even just one of them) often develop resilience against such temptations and don't define the value of their relation through money.\n\nIf the relationship is bad, then parents will almost always seek the fault elsewhere. \"*I* just wanted the best for them, it's their fault for not acknowledging that! Of course I'd yell at them if they don't perform well!\" \n\nAgain, I'm not saying that this is definitely what happened either. But it is a common scenario that leads to cases like this, which is why I'd withold any judgement until I have more information about how much of that was at play.", "I'm not questioning that. What I am questioning is the narrative of how this situation came to be in the first place. If that really is the whole story of why this woman is incapable of independence and responsibility at 21.", "That is possible. It is also possible that we only heard a fraction of the story which left out relevant information that would lead us to a different judgement.", "Continue to sacrifice your body and health for a corporation that doesn\u2019t give a shit if you live or die. Work smarter, not harder, or you\u2019ll end up in an early grave.", "She must get money from somewhere whether she's partying or not, I'm going to guess that the father was financing her lifestyle and the new wife didn't fancy having a adult with no responsibilities as a financial burden.", "How does OP hate her daughter? She's giving her a chance to basically do adulting rehab after being raised to be a spoiled brat by her father.", "Being family doesn't give you a free pass. Relationships, blood related or not, required works on BOTH sides.\n\nOP clearly is giving her daughter a second chance but the daughter isn't interested in that. The daughter is looking for another person to mooch off of, not looking for a parent who is willing to help her out in need.", "I'm convinced a certain.. type... of person frequents this sub.    I randomly end up in here from r/all now and then, but the people who follow this sub closely.... Let's just say they're not the type I would go to for advice about my life.", "This. This girl is used to being provided for/spoiled by a man who doesn't seem to have had her best interests at heart. (Given he ditched her at 17.)\n\nIf she doesn't have a safe place to be, with conditions that seem achievable (working 25+ hours per week might *not* seem achievable to her right now - she has no clue where to start - it might help to add \"volunteering hours\" as an option to help ease her in), finding another man who wants a girlfriend rather than a daughter is going to be the obvious thing to do.", "She can't do adulting because her dad never taught her how to. At one point in our life our parents stop babying us and let us make mistakes and then make us make up for those mistakes. In this scenario it sounds like the dad didn't do his job and is now letting his daughter aka the one he needed to raise and protect take the fall for being a shit parent.", "Probably because the kids\u2019 dad desires pussy more than the daughter he raised to be spoiled and difficult. I have known way too many people whose fathers were spineless and would let their new wives treat children from previous marriages like crap because they desire approval and sex from their partner.", "I'm not focusing on it. I clearly stated OP is NTA. It's just a hell of a way to think of your kid.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She agreed that her own daughter is a waste of space.  That sucks.\n\nOP is NTA for the rules, but read between the lines here: mom got a house in the divorce and still had trouble \"making ends meet.\"  Why is that?  And why did daughter drop out of high school and leave the home in the first place?  Something was wrong here, and it's not just daddy.", "If she was spiteful she probably wouldn\u2019t let her back in. She just isn\u2019t going to be angry with a woman when her daughter is 21 and not doing anything of value in her home and is proving to be mouthy. I was like this too and i dont think my mom was wrong for buckling down with me i was going no where. I just was never mouthy so i was able to get my shit together. I let my mom help. I hope this kid does too.", "I'm honestly not reading all of that because you're not going to change my mind that there's nothing wrong with expecting your 21 year old adult child to behave like an adult while living in your home.", "\"Why is all of your attention on the daughter and not OP? OP is also an adult, and a much older one at that.\"\n\nWell yeah and she's being responsible about it? And she's not the one begging to be housed for free and throwing a tantrum when getting honestly pretty good conditions for staying with someone. All OP is doing is trying to teach the daughter responsibility if she's going to be staying at home, otherwise she'd just get a \"waste of space\" as step mother called her.", "Fr. One of my roommates had to drop out due to to family stuff. One of the smartest people I know, but with no degree she was stuck working dead end jobs. Her New Year\u2019s resolution was to get her GED, she got it by June and is now in her first semester at community college. If you\u2019re at all smart and able to apply yourself it doesn\u2019t seem like it would be hard at all", "Yeah, it was a choice. I can\u2019t have a 9-5 doing what I do, it\u2019s just not a possibility.", "Yeah. I used to work 5 13.5 hour shifts then 5 off.. Then 2 on, then 2 off.  I ended up really liking it.  Get into work mode and just really go at it for 5 days doing nothing else really and then 5 days to do whatever. Travel for concerts or whatever. Or usually just sitting on ass but for several days. By the time it gets old it's time to start again.  Wouldn't work well for families or new relationships I guess.", "Children of divorced parents are at a much higher risk of an assortment of emotional disregulation and mental developmental complications. Add into that co-parenting issues (IE: fun parent vs responsible parent) that leads to a form of parental alienation. \n\nShe may have very well had a 'good' relationship with her father, but that doesn't mean it was a healthy relationship that enabled her to mature into a responsible young adult. It would seem the opposite is what she has developed into. \n\nHowever, there is nothing to suggest the mother caused this by having boundaries and expectations. She would appear mean and unreasonable when compared to a dad who is permissive. There's a reason we do not hold teenagers to adult standards... They haven't fully developed their brain, yet.", "Being spoiled by one parent and turning the other into the bad guy makes perfect sense.", "And the dad could be a secret serial killer. If we're making shit up.", "\"let's imagine some shit that doesn't fit the available information which is complete consistent and believable so that we can get to a place where actually the mother is the one who's wrong\"\n\nI think you may be projecting. A lot.", "I hate to say it, but a pretty girl can scrounge a lot of free drinks.", "Seriously, what about OP's feelings? I'm sure it doesn't feel great when her own daughter she spent 9 months carrying plus labor constantly rejects her and pretty much tells her that she will never see her as her mom.", "I don't think OP hates her daughter. I was reacting to the comments here that seem to be without empathy or deep thought about the daughter's situation - or even OP's situation for that matter. I guess I don't know if these people have kids, but I have heard people speak this way about their own kids, and just so the word is out there - it's not normal to think that way about your kids. It probably means you haven't fully matured yet and need to do some healing from your own childhood. \n\nIt is normal to have your feelings hurt when your kids says something mean,  but not to react like a child would - by resorting to black and white thinking, allowing your hurt feelings to dictate how you respond, feeling vindictive, etc. The top responses in here sound like the guidebook for how to have dysfunctional relationships.", "Daughter has been NEET  (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) for four years and refuses to any plan to change her status, how *would* you describe her?", " I aplaud OP that she can think clearly about such things, because to be fair - she is a waste of space. at this moment. hopefully, that would change. but better to be realistic and say things as they are, the way OP does, rather than pretending something is better just because it's her kid", "I don't think she's even thinking that way about her kid, she said she can't blame the new wife for thinking that, which I interpret as her recognizing how her daughter's behavior is viewed. Also, parenting is hard and OP has been through the wringer with her daughter, and is still willing to show up and be the \"bad guy\" in the hopes of helping her daughter. Even if she does think her daughter is currently behaving like a waste of space, she obviously still has hope that her daughter can change and is willing to put herself out to support that change.", "No, she said she could see how someone might think daughter is a waste of space. Not that she agrees.", "Spite isn't always overt and being spiteful doesn't mean you can't want better for someone.

It\u2019s a completely different conversation. I expect parents to act like parents. The daughter isn\u2019t acting like an adult because the parents never acted like parents. OP needs to catch up on the parenting she should have been doing before, then I\u2019ll say she can reasonably expect her kid to be functional", "OP is not being a responsible parent, though. That\u2019s part of responsible adulthood, if you chose to have a kid. The daughter isn\u2019t asking to live with a stranger for free, it\u2019s her own mom, who gave birth to her in the first place, and then neglected to teach her values when she was younger. These conditions actually aren\u2019t good, shes obviously messed up from her parents using her against each other for years, on top of that now she has to work, study, clean and she can\u2019t have any fun while she does those other things, or else the mother who failed her in the first place will make her homeless. OP isn\u2019t really doing what you say she\u2019s doing, she\u2019s being cold and unforgiving and petty about her own hurt feelings and bad relationship with the ex husband. She should take the daughter in, and then work on her attitude with patience and compassion. If she truly wants a responsible daughter, she\u2019ll start making up for the parenting she failed to do when her kid was under 18.", "This is off-topic from the post, and more in the philosophical, but I struggle when I hear \"it's a choice\" and \"there's no other possibilities\" in the same breath.", "Children aren't entirely stupid about this either. Plenty of them are capable to get a decent guess on personal loyalty rather than purely judge the relation by the value of gifts.\n\n> However, there is nothing to suggest the mother caused this by having boundaries and expectations. \n\nI'm not saying that it is suggested, but that it is a possibility that should be considered before buying into the sole point of view that we're given.", "Yeah, scepticism is for losers. Let's just believe every narrative at first glance, even if it's in a topic that's notorious for nuanced situations and biased points of view.", "I get that it's been a long time since Reddit was considered a somewhat smart platform, but this absolute inability to consider more than one possibility still gets me.\n\nApparently one must be either with the narrative or against it, no place for possibilities and nuance.", "Even if that's the case here you think it'd be hard to get by without money, my guess is she had her needs and wants provided for and when that changed she wanted to move back to her mothers place.", "OP is the parent in this situation. She is not on equal footing with the daughter. Her feelings matter, but that doesn't mean she needs to react like a child and write her daughter off as some sort of enemy - as so many people here are suggesting.", "That is a distinction without a difference.  No mother should speak like that of their daughter.", "Thank you for that perspective. I definitely can understand where you are coming from. I can imagine the daughter would find it hurtful.

Looking at it now, I think I'm dramatic about it, but I also feel like there's a possibility given that I learned that not everything gets resolved linearly and sometmes, even though reasonable, there's always things to look for. Imo anyways.\n\nI just hope it turns out well regardless.", "I meant that you did read it, not that you\u2019d read every word.
