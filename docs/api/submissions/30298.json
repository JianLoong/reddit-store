Life's tough, and wearing the big girl pants means dealing with the not-so-fun stuff like chores and job hours.  \nThe whole situation with your ex? Ugh, that was not a level playing field. It\u2019s like trying to play tug of war with someone who\u2019s got a monster truck against your Mini Cooper - not really a fair match, is it? But you did your best with what you had, and girl, that's all any of us can do.  \nNow, Maria storming out and throwing the \"bad mother\" grenade? That's her lashing out because she\u2019s been served a reality check with a side of \"actions have consequences\" for maybe the first time in her life. It stings, but maybe it's the wake-up call she needs.  \nThe door you\u2019ve left open for her is a gateway to grow up, not just a free bed. You're teaching her that to dance in the rain, you gotta learn to weather the storm (and maybe clean up a little after it). It's okay to stand your ground, and it's okay to expect her to step up.  \nThe tough love bandwagon isn't a joyride, but sometimes it's the only way to the destination of self-respect and responsibility.

Be wary for her getting desperate enough to agree superficially to your terms, but then not bothering to keep to them.", "NTA Demanding that she start seriously helping herself to become a functional adult is the bare minimum for allowing her to move back in.

If they end up wanting to further education and get a better job, they will choose to after realizing most jobs that make a decent living will take higher education. The partying lifestyle will slowly become a normal amount if she ends up taking the responsibilities that you\u2019ve laid out; honestly she\u2019s young and should be allowed to explore and socialize without your control unless it\u2019s an actual issue.

Yes, she's technically an adult and 21. However, she is only in this situation because of her father enabling her choices and you essentially abandoning her.

You need to help her get there, and it won't be easy for either of you now that she's older. Whatever happened between you and her dad for you to absolutely give up on trying with her is a true shame. You failed her as much as her father failed her. I'm appalled at all the others saying this is a reasonable reaction. \n\nYes, some of the rules are reasonable and necessary to establish boundaries, respect, etc., but you need to ease her into this.

Ask if she wants to meet up in like a park(why this because if she makes a scene it wont cause damage like in a restaurant or something cause she definitely seems the type to do some). Ask her that if you do let her live with you as a grown adult what she will be ding to contribute to the household because she is a grown adult who is no longer your little daughter. So ask her this, if she starts to scream and be bratty leave and block her. If she finally decides to behave like her age then have the conversation of what she wants to do, based on that obviously get her signed up for some program to complete her GED, and only then can she move in after she's signed up, and has applied to jobs.", "NTA. That's not even a long list, nor is it anything a mother shouldn't be requiring.", "NTA. Time for some tough love. Your conditions seem reasonable to me. Stick to your guns. She needs to face the real world. Dad created this monster, let her go back to him and stepmom.", "NTA. Your conditions are unimpeachably reasonable. If your daughter wants to be homeless or spend years couch surfing, that\u2019s on her.\nBe prepared to secure your home and belongings. Your daughter is so materialistic and narcissistic she might try something.", "NTA Unfortunately your Ex raised an Entitled Princess and you didn't ask for anything too unreasonable. You've done nothing wrong.", "From what I'm seeing here, you are a very good mother.  \n\nShe's going to have to learn discipline in terms of life anyway, and what you're offering is a very \"light\" amount of it.  21 is way too old to be a screaming toddler.  \n\nYou're fine.", "Your rules seem like simply what anyone would voluntarily do for free room and bord. unless they have a maid. \n  Her response was unreasonable and totally entitled! You\u2019re not helping her if you become her maid or ATM. Make her sign a contract, As she will test you. NTA! Please ignore her rude comments, real parenting is hard! Love her but not the behavior.", "NTA. Good for you for setting clear boundaries, which are very reasonable.", "NTA. She\u2019s learning a hard life lesson, she cut you out when she wasn\u2019t getting what she wanted and now she has to realize that trust and a relationship have to be earned back. You\u2019re not making crazy demands, all of them are for her own benefit. She\u2019s young and impetuous, hopefully this experience will help her get focused and be successful down the line.", "NTA - in fact you are being the best mom to someone that doesn\u2019t understand what you\u2019re sacrificing on her behalf.  Unfortunately she will likely look to find an easy way out instead of investing in herself like you are trying to establish.  Make it clear that she has a place with you despite her antics, and that her decisions also affect you because you want the best for her. Aside from that she will have to lie in the bed she makes", "NTA. She\u2019s 21 and it\u2019s her turn to learn life is hard. You either grow up or you don\u2019t. Choice is hers. She\u2019s just mad she doesn\u2019t have daddy giving her everything anymore. But this is life baby girl! No one gets an easy way out.", "She needs to get her own shit together. NTA. She is right though, it is her life. \u201cYou made your bed now sleep in it\u201d", "TBH the party lifestyle is probably to make it harder for her to fuck up, get too wasted, and keep calling off work, well she is out of a job. Also, a good way to save her money if she has to come back instead of going out each night", "This. Like she may hate ut now but later it will be her saving grace.", "There can be so much love behind the word no. Having to sink or swim could be the best thing for her. It may open her eyes to the fact that mom's top priority had to be necessities.", "This completely \n\nThe only reason she\u2019s back is because she\u2019s been kicked out. She doesn\u2019t want to rebuild a relationship with her mother. She\u2019s just been spoilt to the point where she can\u2019t cope on her own and needs someone to pick up where her dad\u2019s left off.", "Exactly", "... having a beer watching a game is super different than a partying lifestyle...", "This. My bf lives with his parents to save money while he builds his career and saves up to move out. But good god his mother is overbearing over everything. And he even pays rent! Man couldn't even take 5 days for vacation after working 1,5 months straight (during the week, his usual work, while working an event on the weekends, no off days inbetween) without her bickering. My anger issues could neverrrr.", "Wouldn't be surprised if the new wife has similar expectations as the OP.", "And whoever is texting you can offer a place for her to live. This is assuming she stopped texting you since you are no longer her mother (per her).", "yeah she's really lucky she wasn't my mom.. my mom LITERALLY would have hit me in the face and threw me out by my hair if I has spoken to her like that.. and yes my mom was physically abusive if we made her mad.", "Thought the same thing. The content creators are getting lazy", "a friend of mine was a janitor at the school (elementary) I was a cook at.. without a GED. But yes it IS hard to find a job.. things I recommended they wanted a GED for (her family moved around.. they worked as pickers at farms across the U.S.).", "I have a lot of family members that didn\u2019t finish high school no GED and have jobs. It\u2019s doable if you look. It won\u2019t be the best but there\u2019s opportunities.", "Why is trying to help your 16 year old get a job if she wants items that the single mom can't afford trying to be a \"boss?\"", "100 a week is not nominal that's more than ONE paycheck at 25 hours a week at min wage. Is it the price of the real world no it's less but the goal is to get her to get her shit together education wise and basic responsibilities.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

NTA", "I completely agree. My point more so being that pushing rules to hard can lead to revolt in some people. I don\u2019t think any of the rules OP listed are even close to unreasonable.", "From my understanding, the new wife hates her and has literally called her a waste of space. She made it clear that she won\u2019t be in the home since she is a bad influence and drain of money.\n\nI don\u2019t blame her for that opinion", "Yeah because it reads like a daughter arguing with a boss rather than conversing with a Mother. I\u2019m sure the daughter had typical teenage-angst but Mom was not in a good headspace either and probably \u201cInstructed,\u201d rather than \u201cEncouraged,\u201d style of parenting. Of course a child will have a different attitude towards a parent who doesn\u2019t parent, just says do", "I mean these rules are so mild that I think they should be pushed hard or she gets kicked out", "Sorry.\n\nStill, its your daughter, so giving her a chance is understandable.\n\nBest of luck.", "We can still blame your ex for spoiling her so bad it undermined you and ruined things right?"]}
