Tough luck on OP, not her problem. Wife decided to book said days after she knew OP booked holiday and wanted to spend as much quality time as possible with her, and she went ahead and made plans with friends anyway? A bit selfish and hurtful on the wife's part.", "Yes, this is what I'd like to know the answer to!", "> She\u2019s been on holiday for a week and I just started mine too. For the two weeks I\u2019m off on holiday, she has already made plans with her friends for both weekends which hurt my feelings a bit, but I got over it. I figured we still have this weekend and all the weekdays.\n\nWell, I completely disagree with your interpretation because he clearly stated we have weekdays and not we have weekday evenings. Plus, based on OP\u2019s comments, the real reason he doesn\u2019t like her hanging out with her friends is because they go drinking, and OP himself had some alcohol issues and no longer drinks, but is seemingly upset the wife still can and does.", "I'll respectfully disagree with yours too as I feel it's not totally clear, and that's okay. \n\nInteresting about OP having alcohol issues, assuming you mean in his replies right? Did he say \"issues\" or  addiction? I ask because a lot of people that are recovering from addiction do tend to enjoy the outdoors more and go to the gym etc, something that makes you feel a bit more human  and \"alive\" so to speak. \n\nI don't know, knowing now he's had issues with alcohol in the past it seems even more insensitive of his wife to go out drinking most weekends with her friends. Like if my partner had problems and addictions to alcohol and I went through it all  with them, I'm probably not going to go out drinking most weekends.\n\nAlso when the wife said \"does every walk have to be like 2 hours\" I wonder if she's bought up this before to him that she doesn't like walking/hiking etc, or if it was the first time? If he knew she doesn't like them, not fair on wife. If OP thought they were going out for a nice little walk/explore and was all happy like a puppy and then wife dropped that comment, hurtful.", "> Because I\u2019ve quit drinking as it had become a problem my wife expressed worry over\n\nThe above is his actual comment, and he mentioned in other comments that when she goes out with her friends, they drink and he doesn\u2019t like how much she does.\n\nWhich, if he has concerns about her drinking like she did about his, that\u2019s definitely a conversation they need to have, but it\u2019s entirely separate from this pettiness about the walk. If it\u2019s just because he doesn\u2019t like that she can still drink and he can\u2019t, I think that\u2019s more of a gray area personally. No one else should have to stop doing something simply because that person cannot handle the same thing. It\u2019s obviously nice if an SO (or even family or friends) choose to cut back or even completely in solidarity, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone else\u2019s responsibility to do that if they don\u2019t want to, especially since she doesn\u2019t seem to be doing it in front of him since she\u2019s out with friends.\n\nI agree with you that the wife\u2019s verbiage about does it always have to be a walk this long makes it a strong possibility that it\u2019s been mentioned before. It just seems like such an easy solution to do something they both enjoy, or do an abbreviated walk and then go do something she enjoys afterwards.\n\nLike I said though, I think the underlying issue is that she goes out drinking just based on the handful of comments OP made before peacing out from responding to anyone else completely lol.", "Hmm yeah....this whole thing doesn't seem to be the clear cut case we think it might be on either side. Guy had drinking problems, she goes out drinking all the time so possibly alcohol issues herself, wife makes snappy remarks, husband walks off in a huff....I think they need marriage counselling, not Reddit haha.\n\nBut thank you for debating like a decent person without resorting to sarcasm, insults and being obnoxious like so many do on here. Two people can have a difference of opinion without it getting heated, the way it should be!\n\nHave a good day \ud83d\udc4b", "Same to you. Thanks for the interesting convo!"]}
