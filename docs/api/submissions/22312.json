But what I do like is walking with my man! \nOP, I honestly believe that your wife was being selfish re: the walk. \nYou're not the AH for feeling upset and walking away. You're only human. Wifey thinks you're overreacting because you haven't told her about all the resentment you're feeling that led to your reaction. \nHOWEVER, I do think that you're overreacting about her friends and her plans to spend time with them during your vacation period.

So now hubby is alone for most of his vacation time, other than maybe eating dinner with his wife Monday through Friday.  But the first weekend, wifey has no plans.

With jobs, life etc, it's hard to sometimes get to book some quality time together with your SO, so when you do have a free period the natural thought process is to make the most of it.\n\nI do think it was very selfish that your wife booked out her only free periods over the next few weeks with her friends, instead of you (I'm assuming she works Mon-Fri) I can understand your hurt and frustration, that was selfish.\n\nI think the issue is, you might have just tried an activity she's not overly into and she didn't want to make it an all day thing.

She enjoys one of those things, but not the other. You can\u2019t force someone to enjoy something they don\u2019t. This has nothing to do with her not wanting to spend time with him and everything to do with her seemingly not enjoying taking long walks. \n\nAnd she planned several days with her friends, not the entirety of their time off. If you think that someone can\u2019t enjoy having their own friends or interests outside of their marriage, the problem is you. It\u2019s healthy to do things without your spouse, and you don\u2019t need to be attached at the hip. OP even said they had every weekday he was off to do something, so what\u2019s the problem?\n\nThey need to do something they both enjoy, not just what OP enjoys.
