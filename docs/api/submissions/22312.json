A bit selfish and hurtful on the wife's part.", "Yes, this is what I'd like to know the answer to!", "> She\u2019s been on holiday for a week and I just started mine too. For the two weeks I\u2019m off on holiday, she has already made plans with her friends for both weekends which hurt my feelings a bit, but I got over it. I figured we still have this weekend and all the weekdays.\n\nWell, I completely disagree with your interpretation because he clearly stated we have weekdays and not we have weekday evenings. Plus, based on OP\u2019s comments, the real reason he doesn\u2019t like her hanging out with her friends is because they go drinking, and OP himself had some alcohol issues and no longer drinks, but is seemingly upset the wife still can and does.", "I'll respectfully disagree with yours too as I feel it's not totally clear, and that's okay. \n\nInteresting about OP having alcohol issues, assuming you mean in his replies right? Did he say \"issues\" or  addiction? I ask because a lot of people that are recovering from addiction do tend to enjoy the outdoors more and go to the gym etc, something that makes you feel a bit more human  and \"alive\" so to speak. \n\nI don't know, knowing now he's had issues with alcohol in the past it seems even more insensitive of his wife to go out drinking most weekends with her friends. Like if my partner had problems and addictions to alcohol and I went through it all  with them, I'm probably not going to go out drinking most weekends.\n\nAlso when the wife said \"does every walk have to be like 2 hours\" I wonder if she's bought up this before to him that she doesn't like walking/hiking etc, or if it was the first time? If he knew she doesn't like them, not fair on wife. If OP thought they were going out for a nice little walk/explore and was all happy like a puppy and then wife dropped that comment, hurtful.", "> Because I\u2019ve quit drinking as it had become a problem my wife expressed worry over\n\nThe above is his actual comment, and he mentioned in other comments that when she goes out with her friends, they drink and he doesn\u2019t like how much she does.\n\nWhich, if he has concerns about her drinking like she did about his, that\u2019s definitely a conversation they need to have, but it\u2019s entirely separate from this pettiness about the walk. If it\u2019s just because he doesn\u2019t like that she can still drink and he can\u2019t, I think that\u2019s more of a gray area personally. No one else should have to stop doing something simply because that person cannot handle the same thing. It\u2019s obviously nice if an SO (or even family or friends) choose to cut back or even completely in solidarity, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone else\u2019s responsibility to do that if they don\u2019t want to, especially since she doesn\u2019t seem to be doing it in front of him since she\u2019s out with friends.\n\nI agree with you that the wife\u2019s verbiage about does it always have to be a walk this long makes it a strong possibility that it\u2019s been mentioned before. It just seems like such an easy solution to do something they both enjoy, or do an abbreviated walk and then go do something she enjoys afterwards.\n\nLike I said though, I think the underlying issue is that she goes out drinking just based on the handful of comments OP made before peacing out from responding to anyone else completely lol.", "Hmm yeah....this whole thing doesn't seem to be the clear cut case we think it might be on either side. Guy had drinking problems, she goes out drinking all the time so possibly alcohol issues herself, wife makes snappy remarks, husband walks off in a huff....I think they need marriage counselling, not Reddit haha.\n\nBut thank you for debating like a decent person without resorting to sarcasm, insults and being obnoxious like so many do on here. Two people can have a difference of opinion without it getting heated, the way it should be!\n\nHave a good day \ud83d\udc4b", "Same to you. Thanks for the interesting convo!", "I think it very much depends on what she does with her friends. If she's just not into long walks but would be happy to do other things with you, then maybe you're being over sensitive. Maybe speak to her about other things you could  do together? If she's off on long hikes with her friends that does change the perspective and it doesn't make you TA, but I think expressing your feelings in a calmer way would give you a better outcome", "I think she was just trying to point out that she does not like to walk for 2 hours (fair enough). How about walking and then sitting somewhere or maybe she has a different suggestion what she'd like to do?  \nI doubt that she was trying to hurt your feelings by spending less time with you. It sounds more like that she would prefer to spend that time some other way. You should have given her the benefit of the doubt.  \nYTA for overreacting and not actually having a conversation with her, to discover where the problem lies. Or maybe you are still hurt that she already made plans without you and now you finally had a chance to take that anger out on her?", "YTA, for all the communication reasons people have already listed here but mainly, IMO:\n\n\"For the two weeks I\u2019m off on holiday, she has already made plans with her friends for both weekends which hurt my feelings a bit, but I got over it. **I figured we still have this weekend and all the weekdays.**\"\n\nSo, unless I'm severely misunderstanding that paragraph, both you and your wife are on holiday for at least another week, if not two. And you are upset she is not spending every single day with you? She probably made plans with her friends on the weekend because, unlike her (and you!), the friends aren't on holiday, so that's when they are available. The rest of her week is free, but you are pissy because she had the nerve to want to enjoy the company of other people for 2 days out of 7 (or 4 out of 14, doesn't matter).\n\nI don't know if you are controlling or just really emotionally dependent on her, but either way, you should think long and hard about your expectations on her time and energy.", "YTA. What are you, 12? You threw a tantrum like a stroppy toddler. 2 hours is a long time for WALKING for a LOT of people. There's a difference between sitting at cafe and talking and WALKING. I LOVE walking but 2 hours in one stretch on a regular basis is too much even for me.", "I wanna know how hot it is there too. Cuz in the Southern US it\u2019s 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36 Celsius)", "I know you're getting downvotes a lot but for what it's worth, I agree with you.\n\nIf you're in a long term married relationship and have lived long enough to build on your emotional intelligence, you you understand that relationships should be a 50/50 partnership. Unfortunately that does mean on occasions you need to compromise and do things that the other really enjoys, but you might not be keen on and vice versa. I feel like only those who have been in long term commited relationships will see that. \n\nOP wanted to spend some quality time with his wife on his holidays, not do a bunch of coke and blow thousands at a strip bar and neglect his wife. I don't think it's a lot to ask to go for a walk for a few hours on a nice day watching your dog run around exploring, sounds nice if anything. If the wife has already stated on multiple occasions she doesn't like walking etc, then yeah OP is an AH as he could have picked something different to do ...but it doesn't read to me she's voiced that, which is why the comment might have caught OP by surprise and upset him.\n\nIt's also mentioned in comments that OP had previous issues with alcohol and no longer drinks, and his wife seems to go out drinking a lot at the weekends, that doesn't sound supportive to me. Like if I was a recovering drug addict and my wife was going out every weekend getting stoned with her friends over spending time with me, I'd be a bit annoyed too probably.", "Yeah & the feel like is 106\u00b0F. The humidity doing us dirty\ud83e\udd72", "So instead of going home with her and actually spending time with her you showed her you would rather go off for a walk alone.", "Especially since they'll be spending all the weekdays together! It's natural for his wife to want to spend time with her friends/on her own too sometimes.", "Or as the absolute bare minimum, communicate that he wanted to do something those weekends?", "He said he was too upset to keep walking with her and left. He didn\u2019t openly and honestly address the issue by saying \u201cthat makes me feel like you don\u2019t want to spend time with me.\u201d That\u2019s why it\u2019s passive aggressive.", "NTA. You wanted to walk, she didn\u2019t, you kept walking.", "#use your words!", "You assumed she didn\u2019t want to spend time with you because she asked why every walk is long.", "Yta it\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t wanna spend time with you, she just doesn\u2019t wanna go on multiple hours worth of walks. What does your wife like to do? What do you guys have in common?? Do those things, silly.", "YTA you sound controlling and judgy", "The time she's spending with her friends may not involve long walks. If you like long walks and she doesn't then maybe you need another walking buddy. I get you're annoyed thar she booked up her weekends, but like you say you have the weekdays together. You don't have to spend all of your time off together. It might be that her friends weren't available at other times.", "YTA I also hate long walks. Why does spending time with your wife have to be doing something only you want to do?", "Sounds like a lot of little things adding up to hurt feelings. Find a time for open communication to get to the root of the problem. It\u2019s not the walk.", "NTA", "I must ask, why must the time spent together be on long walks? Doesn\u2019t sound like she enjoys those like you do. Sounds like you need to communicate your feels without, instead of bottling them up until you explode like that.", "ESH.  You need to communicate better.  If she doesn't like walks then find another activity to do together.   Walking away from a conversation when you're frustrated is okay but leaving her home to walk \"separate ways\" was kind of rude.", "Why can't the wife plan to do something with her husband during her time off like she did with her friends?", "Two weekends in a row, not every weekend. And OP doesn't make it clear if she's spending the whole weekend with her friends or just one day or evening", "OP didn't say \"unless\" anything. He didn't even make out like his wife was going on walks with her friends, at all.", "She's allowed to want to go home and not walk for 2 hours.", "I\u2019m in the UK and it\u2019s been pissing it down all week. I wouldn\u2019t want to walk in that either.", "On the west coast is in the 100's so everyone I know is hiding indoors as much as possible!", "97??? LOL it's 6:30 PM right now and it's 104 \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc80", "Right sounds like her friends are fun, and you're not.", "Why don\u2019t you find friends to do stuff with. On one hand, I think it\u2019s crappy if she expects you to revolve your calendar around hers in order to get to spend any time together. But you also have to have reasonable expectations about spending time together. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d be making myself a lot more scarce and taking up a new hobby or going off for a week or two to visit my family or whatever brings you joy.", "Drinking with friends is way more fun than walking. She's doing the right thing for some fun on the weekends off.", "I never said that but there\u2019s a big difference when taking a two hour walk in the upper 90s vs 70 degrees. I know I wouldn\u2019t be any to walk in the heat for 2 hours but I would be willing to do so in cooler weather or for a shorter amount of time. I\u2019m just pointing out another reason, when there are multiple reasons to not want to walk for 2 hours but it doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s bc she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with OP", "just walks \ud83e\udd23", "This is literally the perfect solution. Which is quite literally just communication. My boyfriend and I have zero hobbies in common. A simple \u201chey I want to spend time together\u201d and suddenly we\u2019re watching some random movie neither of us would have watched previously. A lil communication and compromise solves so many problems", "Yeah communication would solve this issue without it turning into a huge fight. 99% of relationship problems would be.\n\nOP, just say that you're hurt she booked the trips and that you're worried she doesn't want to spend time together. She can clarify the rest better than any of us can.", "Further down he admits to having had a drinking problem so there\u2019s a lot going on here that will require professional support.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve quit drinking as it had become a problem my wife expressed worry over\u201d", "Okay, I've been around recovering alcoholics a lot...\n\nDo you think you might be resenting that your wife is able to go out and drink and that you can't? Something you used to do a lot, enough to concern your wife, and used to do together isn't an option anymore and that makes you feel like you have nothing left. But you need to figure out how to fill that space with things you both love, good luck OP", "INFO: why does it matter which day of the week you hang out on if you both have multiple weeks off? weekends are only special as a result of weekdays being work days", "YTA. For me it's sounds like you want it to be all about you. If you wanted to spend a weekend with her why did you not make a plan? Maybe ask her out for a date night grab flowers the whole 9yards.  Find something you both enjoy cause it doesn't sound like you both enjoy walking for hrs with a dog lol. \nShe made plans with her friends cause that's what people do when they want to have fun and you sound annoyed that she made plans. You need to think ahead sir. No one wants to sit around going what do u wanna do for hrs.", "So she was done walking and wanted you to go home *together,* but you told yourself she didn't want to spend time with you, got hurt and so angry that you left without her. That's straight childish manipulation. Learn to regulate your emotions. YTA, big time.", "I think some clear communication needs to happen Between you two n", "YTA let her rest asshole", "Have you ever tried to do an activity that isnt walking the dog for hours?\n\nYeah bro, it's not a surprise she doesn't want to do that.\nAlso seriously i have no idea why you even mentioned that she made plans with friends on the weekends.", "Just guessing, because he doesn't want to do anything she enjoys", "For context: OP has recently quit drinking because his wife had concerns over it, and it bothers OP that she drinks a lot with her friends", "> She enjoys one of those things, but not the other. You can\u2019t force someone to enjoy something they don\u2019t. \n\nI think you can read it one of two ways, and it's highly dependent on how their normal days look.\n\nIt seems his primary complaint is that she doesn't make time for him. Does she not make time for him because she'd rather hang out with friends, or doesn't like what they do when they spend time together, and the walk just happened to be his frustration about spending time together bubbling over?", "I suspect it's more about walking for 2 hours than spending the time with you. Have you asked her that?", "You both need to communicate better.", "It's supposed to be 111 degrees Fahrenheit where I live tomorrow", "So?  I'm simply saying a SO can be concerned with 'outside' the relationship activity.  I NEVER said every weekend.  And it was every weekend of the vacation.  Apparently the OP can't drink, so she doesn't want to be around him.  I actually understand that.  But he can also want some time together.  Maybe they need to re-evaluate the whole relationship.", "No, but the commenter that I replied to did.", "Same! 110 today and 111 tomorrow lol we might be in the same area, I was moving some things around the garage today and was dripping sweat.", "Probably, this is more likely than not.\n\nBoth people should be trying to spend time with the other person, and it shouldn't be up to one person to organize everything."]}
