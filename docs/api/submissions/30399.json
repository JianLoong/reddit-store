So an individual may not have experienced a singular traumatic event but has trauma related to it because of how their community has responded/recovered from that event (like I have boomer family members who were shown some fairly graphic images from the Holocaust at >10 years old & were told it could happen again but this time in America which drastically shaped how they think about the world)\n* We have one 16 year old who is probably being exposed to a lot of heightened emotions around Israel/Palestine (and may have generational trauma) resulting in a shorter fuse around perceived antisemitism. There have been a lot of reports of increased antisemitism especially online. \u2192 using German isn't automatically antisemitic but I could see children coming up with horrible ways of using it to be antisemitic\n* We have a second kid (the OP) who is randomly using individual words from another language which is odd but is maybe no more cringy than the kid who uses a bunch of random Japanese words they picked up from anime\n\nIn terms of your own heritage, a Reform Rabbi explained:\n\n> While DNA testing can indicate the likelihood that one has Jewish genetic ancestry, that's not the same as being a Jew. Being Jewish means that one is a member of the Jewish people, or what Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan famously called a \"religious civilization\" - an ethnicity, culture, and faith tradition all rolled into one.

It's a word I use because it is also Yiddish (as you saw in another comment I made) and I grew up in a community that uses it. But it's a word I've had to explain when I've been to other places because it is not commonly used and confuses people. I think the use of loan words is super situational and in one context it could be normal and in another context it could be cringy. In this situation, it is a normal word for you to use at home but is perhaps not a normal word in your larger community (ie. school) so you may have to continually explain using it.\n\nMy response was mostly directed at the person who said \"educate me\" & was a bit bombastic. My view of the situation is NAH as your conflict seems to be fairly minor high school drama with the other girl being overly sensitive a single time during a period of high antisemitism. You're allowed to use the language of your community. In general, I give teenagers more leeway when they respond to situations incorrectly but if the girl continues to cause drama because of it, I would reach out to a guidance counselor.", "The post I linked to goes on to mention that a lot of people who do DNA tests end up wanting to learn more about Judaism; I'm not Reform so I can't speak to the links they include but it appears to be mostly classes on different aspects (culture, language, etc).", "Thank you!

I didn't say I was bilingual.", "Yiddish has a bunch of loan words some of which (like gesundheit) came from German originally. Then some English speaking communities have incorporated Yiddish words (ie. Yiddish words became loan words themselves). \n\nTracing linguistics can be fun; like there are multiple Yiddish dialects which led to a vigorous debate when Duolingo wanted to create a Yiddish course because they had to determine what dialect to teach."]}
