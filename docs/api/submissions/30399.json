That doesn\u2019t make German words offensive or unacceptable.\n\nIs a relationship where you fear pissing off your BF due to his own stupidity a good relationship?\n\nI\u2019m half German, bilingual. I didn\u2019t tell anyone when I was in secondary school and this is exactly why. Sad to see kids are still bringing up nazis every time anything German is mentioned. Hopefully you get less of this crap as you get older", "If it was a german name, maybe Junge (boy), Junger (young one, but dont use it on its own for humans), J\u00fcnger (the name for the 12 men following jesus, would be a word play about the dog following his owners) or J\u00fcrgen (male german name)? Idk. Sounds like it was fun around them ^ ^", "As a Texan that IS bilingual in German (thanks Oma!) the fact that the person you are replying to justifies recognition of a common German word as antisemitism is wild to me\n\nYou literally said \"good health\". What if she was Catholic and you tried to bless her instead?! That's blasphemous (/s)", "Yiddish is generally recognized as a variant of German with Hebrew and Aramaic loan words. So it\u2019s a bit more than just having German loan words - it is primarily a Germanic language and is close enough to German that understanding one can allow you to understand the other.", "Thank you so much. I've realized alot. I'm gonna give my boyfriend space for now and see what happens. I'm gonna avoid the girl and report her comments to the principal if she continues", "My above post specifically says that using German isn't automatically antisemitic; there's an arrow and everything so how could one miss it (/s). The main point was that teenagers with heightened emotions during charged times should get a bit more of a leeway when they make a single mistake. The OP didn't say the other girl was running around accusing everyone and everything of antisemitism. Ideally, the OP could explain why they use gesundheit and the other girl would apologize for being overly sensitive. If the other girl escalates or continues to accuse the OP of being antisemitic, then as I said above the OP should loop in a guidance counselor or another adult at school.\n\nThe OP doesn't have to stop code switching (ie. using German words) when at school or in other places but they then may be asked what a word means or a word might be misunderstood because others lack context for it. I've had to explain what gesundheit and other Yiddish words mean when I've used them around people unfamiliar with them.", "OP: \"Gesundheit (good health)\"\n\nMairwyn: \"I could see children coming up with horrible ways of using it (the German language) to be antisemitic\""]}
