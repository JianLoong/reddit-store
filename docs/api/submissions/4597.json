I parked in a far row at the hospital and returned to find two SUVs left me no room to get in or get my baby's bucket seat in. I wasn't the most ambulatory considering the incision... I ended up nearly ripping myself apart putting the seat through the hatch back (couldn't fold the seat down because the car seat base was in the middle position.) Then I twisted my inflexible, overexerted self into the front seat. I wish I could give the people a piece of my mind because you have no reason to park so close to someone in an empty lane!
