I prefer to let things get really messy and then clean them up and she prefers to clean as she goes. As a high school student taking a couple of advanced classes, my week can get pretty stressful, and I figured out early in the year that I need something to look forward to during the week, aka what I call a \"rest day,\" where I do absolutely nothing all day but read, watch TV, and eat snacks. Right now, this day is a Saturday, as I have school during the week and work on Sundays. My mom has never understood this. Today (saturday) I agreed to do a couple of small chores but stopped there. Earlier, she asked me to clean off my dresser and bed, a task that would take at least an hour, so I politely told her that today is my rest day and I'm not doing it. Also, my neck and arm are really hurting because i apparently did something while doing another chore, so I wasn't having it. She got pissy and said that it wouldn't take me that long and I should just do it. I told her no, repeating that i need one day a week to just decompress and do nothing. She then started yelling that then I need to pick a day to do cleaning. I decided on Wednesday as that is normally my most free day of the week. She then started lecturing me that she doesn't want to hear me complain come Wednesday. A few hours later she saw me on the couch watching a movie while she was mopping and said \"You know, I was planning on doing some of that cleaning together, but if you do it later, then it's just going to be you.\" She then started lecturing me again about how she doesn't get a rest day and kept muttering under her breath and trying to get me to do it today.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing?", "created_utc": 1677365513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11by9x0/aita_for_refusing_to_clean_my_room_on_a_saturday/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Start on Thursday if that's what it's going to take. Ask your mom about chores you can take care of that day, while mentioning that you're hoping to have free time tomorrow. Then she (a) is able to point you at the stuff she needs done and (b) gets a chance to buy into the \"rest day\" by showing you how this can be made to work for the whole family.

It's a good idea to set these habits early in life - maintaining your living space, keeping your things tidy, developing a sense of responsibility, and figuring out an organization system that works for you is key.

Clutter and really infrequent cleaning also increases likelihood of pests like ants and rodents, which affect the whole house too. The way I see it, parents who expect their kids to maintain a reasonably tidy environment are helping to train them for more successful adulthood. \n\nThat's not to say kids should be expected to output \"white-glove\" level cleaning or be punished, but they absolutely need to learn how to maintain a tidy living environment for their own good as it can affect their health and wellbeing as well as their future social relationships.

It would make my life so much easier now if I had built that habit before. I know we can say that we don\u2019t mind the mess, and we can still function around it, but, especially if you are ever planning to share a space with someone, having things clean is so much better all around. \n\nI wish you the best of luck!

(Ex: parent is upset that you didn\u2019t unload the dishwasher. Instead of directly telling you, they unload the dishwasher and slam the cabinets or make snide comments, then making you feel upset.) That\u2019s not fair to you. She is an adult and can communicate like one.\n\nShe also is a parent, not getting rest days is expected. However, if she needs them (every human needs rest), she can set aside time to get it. You shouldn\u2019t be guilted for not working as hard as someone who has children. \n\nAs long as you are communicating respectfully, (ex: \u201cI understand that you won\u2019t help me later this week, that is ok with me, thanks for the offer\u201d), I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole.  \n\nAll that being said, having a clean room has really improved my mental health.

Cleaning your room and keeping up with it helps learning that.\n\nThere are a few things you can do to make it easier for you:\n\n- always clean up empty food/drink containers and dishes as soon as possible. \n- limit crumbs or vacuum after them as soon as possible.\n- put dirty clothes straight into the laundry basket (if easier, get a basket to put in your own room).\n- put clean clothes straight back into the closet.\n- clean your desk after doing your homework, if you do that every day it only takes you a few minutes.\n- put trash in your bin.\n- if you have a lot of loose homeless clutter, get a few nice little baskets to put them in. Use a system like someone above explained f needed or just let clutter be clutter in the little baskets. But it keeps the clutter contained making it easier to clean and it looks more organized.\n\nTake one day a week where you frenzy through your room to vacuum completely and clean what is left to clean, this will then take far less than an hour. In fact I think you'd be done well within 30 minutes.\nThis means it can be done after school, before or after work, or on Saturday morning.

Because at 16, OP shouldn't just be dealing with her room; she should be helping out around the house some. Which is why I suggested what I did. \n\nBut tbh, I also think teens should have some agency over their bedrooms, provided they're not compromising hygiene, causing damage, or putting up hate paraphernalia. My mum stopped prompting me to clean my room at around 11, and at first I kind of luxuriated in being able to let things stay messy. Then after a few weeks of misplacing things and constantly moving a heap of stuff from the bed to the desk or the desk to the bed depending on which I needed to use, I realized it's inconvenient and stifling for things to get too cluttered, and it made me feel bad about my space, and I started self-regulating my own cleaning. I know not every kid/teen will come to the same conclusion I did, but I think it's important to give them a chance to get into their own sustainable habit of cleaning without being prompted, even if it looks a bit different than their adults', because they'll need to do it all by themselves anyway once they move out. And setting a specific day of the week to routinely do it is a good start.", "I dunno. The first thing that pinged for me was mental health issues. Cleanliness and orderliness are often the first things to go, and from what op said about juggling advanced classes and needing to have a whole day to just relax, I\u2019d say it\u2019s likely burnout coupled with adhd and possibly depression and anxiety. She sounds like an anxious person with overload who lets stuff get \u2018bad\u2019 because she\u2019s stressed about it and doesn\u2019t know how to handle it. Obviously you\u2019d think the clear response would be to clean, but when you\u2019re so overwhelmed about multiple things, little things will tip you off and a huge way people react to it is by using the \u2018flight/freeze\u2019 response. Op is ignoring the issue of her messiness because she\u2019s overwhelmed, and she acknowledges this by noting she needs a \u2018rest day\u2019 without realising the bigger picture. It is very easy to get caught in that cycle of \u2018this stresses me out too much so I just won\u2019t think about it\u2019, especially with adhd. \n\nIt is small minded to not consider the amount of work her mother does in the household, but I think the issue here is mental health issues, not just ignorance and inconsiderate behaviour. The answer is to delve into why op feels and reacts this way over something that won\u2019t be all that time or energy costly. Maybe it *does* actually feel like a big chore to her, and that\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t think we should jump to avenues of op being spoilt/entitled/inconsiderate without thinking maybe she actually does feel over exerted.\n\nETA: I also think it\u2019s kind of weird how the mum is acting in this situation. On one hand, she should be encouraging you to clean, on the other, she\u2019s kind of over extending and going into manipulative territory. You ask your daughter, firmly, to clean her room. You ask her again and again. She doesn\u2019t. Don\u2019t guilt trip your child into doing something for herself, if she doesn\u2019t listen to you when you ask her to then just leave it and she will learn. Yelling at them everyday? Too much. You\u2019re actively discouraging her by that point. Using emotional manipulation on top of that, to toy with your kids emotions and make them dread being around you because you can\u2019t be around them without purposefully engaging in behaviours that will make them feel shitty? Sounds like the mum might be part of the problem I mentioned earlier. It\u2019s one thing to say \u2018you\u2019re not helping me out here and that\u2019s unfair, you need to pull your weight\u2019 and another thing to not be able to be in the same room as them without commenting on how much you want a rest day and can\u2019t, and how awful they make things for you, and how difficult things are. This is her room we\u2019re talking about, not the mothers. To be constantly sulking about it sounds manipulative on mums part.

I'm the parent of teenagers -- including a sixteen year old -- and I absolutely agree that time off is important. I also agree that it's difficult for teenagers to focus on clearing up when so many other things require their attention. However, it's not optional. It's not something that can be left for weeks while other things take priority. This is an important part of helping someone learn to look after themselves. \n\nIf I asked my teenager to clean his room and he responded as OP did, I would be very surprised and disappointed.", "Unless she has cats.

I said one should get an actual diagnosis from a profit, not self diagnose, as it legitimizes it for all of us and gives OP and associated family an avenue to resources and tools to help them manage thkngs in the long run, thereby preventing it from becoming a crutch (ie: \"excuse\"). Also, I'm not sure you understand what \"gaslighting\" is. What you're saying to me may count, however, as I did not even use those words. All individuals should take the time and invest in themselves by getting diagnosed with ADHD from a professional, not simply decide one has it because of self observation. That takes away legitimacy from all of us, including what you're trying to do to me. I believe getting assistance from a third party is always beneficial and in this situation would likely help mom also, she would be more likely to give her daughter a break due to the validation of daughter's needs and personal experience. \n\nHonestly, your reply seems so out of left field compared to what I posted that I am wondering maybe you meant to reply to someone else?
