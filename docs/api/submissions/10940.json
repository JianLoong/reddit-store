I prefer to let things get really messy and then clean them up and she prefers to clean as she goes. As a high school student taking a couple of advanced classes, my week can get pretty stressful, and I figured out early in the year that I need something to look forward to during the week, aka what I call a \"rest day,\" where I do absolutely nothing all day but read, watch TV, and eat snacks. Right now, this day is a Saturday, as I have school during the week and work on Sundays. My mom has never understood this. Today (saturday) I agreed to do a couple of small chores but stopped there. Earlier, she asked me to clean off my dresser and bed, a task that would take at least an hour, so I politely told her that today is my rest day and I'm not doing it. Also, my neck and arm are really hurting because i apparently did something while doing another chore, so I wasn't having it. She got pissy and said that it wouldn't take me that long and I should just do it. I told her no, repeating that i need one day a week to just decompress and do nothing. She then started yelling that then I need to pick a day to do cleaning. I decided on Wednesday as that is normally my most free day of the week. She then started lecturing me that she doesn't want to hear me complain come Wednesday. A few hours later she saw me on the couch watching a movie while she was mopping and said \"You know, I was planning on doing some of that cleaning together, but if you do it later, then it's just going to be you.\" She then started lecturing me again about how she doesn't get a rest day and kept muttering under her breath and trying to get me to do it today.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing?", "created_utc": 1677365513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11by9x0/aita_for_refusing_to_clean_my_room_on_a_saturday/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Start on Thursday if that's what it's going to take. Ask your mom about chores you can take care of that day, while mentioning that you're hoping to have free time tomorrow. Then she (a) is able to point you at the stuff she needs done and (b) gets a chance to buy into the \"rest day\" by showing you how this can be made to work for the whole family.

It's a good idea to set these habits early in life - maintaining your living space, keeping your things tidy, developing a sense of responsibility, and figuring out an organization system that works for you is key.

Keeping your living space reasonably clean and contributing to household chores is essential for mature adults and practicing that as a kid is the best way to ensure those habits carry over into adulthood. If OP's mom just shut the door and ignored the mess, she's missing an opportunity to instill the importance of reasonable tidiness to her kid. \n\nIf OP ever gets roommates or ever gets into a live-in relationship, she's at a tremendous disadvantage if she sucks at cleaning up after herself and needs to be told when to clean every single time. Clutter and really infrequent cleaning also increases likelihood of pests like ants and rodents, which affect the whole house too. The way I see it, parents who expect their kids to maintain a reasonably tidy environment are helping to train them for more successful adulthood. \n\nThat's not to say kids should be expected to output \"white-glove\" level cleaning or be punished, but they absolutely need to learn how to maintain a tidy living environment for their own good as it can affect their health and wellbeing as well as their future social relationships. Far, far too many young adults are sent out into the world without a single clue how to clean up after themselves properly and that's a true disservice to them that could be remedied by more involvement by their parents when they're still kids", "I have ADHD.
