I prefer to let things get really messy and then clean them up and she prefers to clean as she goes. As a high school student taking a couple of advanced classes, my week can get pretty stressful, and I figured out early in the year that I need something to look forward to during the week, aka what I call a \"rest day,\" where I do absolutely nothing all day but read, watch TV, and eat snacks. Right now, this day is a Saturday, as I have school during the week and work on Sundays. My mom has never understood this. Today (saturday) I agreed to do a couple of small chores but stopped there. Earlier, she asked me to clean off my dresser and bed, a task that would take at least an hour, so I politely told her that today is my rest day and I'm not doing it. Also, my neck and arm are really hurting because i apparently did something while doing another chore, so I wasn't having it. She got pissy and said that it wouldn't take me that long and I should just do it. I told her no, repeating that i need one day a week to just decompress and do nothing. She then started yelling that then I need to pick a day to do cleaning. I decided on Wednesday as that is normally my most free day of the week. She then started lecturing me that she doesn't want to hear me complain come Wednesday. A few hours later she saw me on the couch watching a movie while she was mopping and said \"You know, I was planning on doing some of that cleaning together, but if you do it later, then it's just going to be you.\" She then started lecturing me again about how she doesn't get a rest day and kept muttering under her breath and trying to get me to do it today.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing?", "created_utc": 1677365513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11by9x0/aita_for_refusing_to_clean_my_room_on_a_saturday/", "score": 430, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a good idea to set these habits early in life - maintaining your living space, keeping your things tidy, developing a sense of responsibility, and figuring out an organization system that works for you is key.

The way I see it, parents who expect their kids to maintain a reasonably tidy environment are helping to train them for more successful adulthood. \n\nThat's not to say kids should be expected to output \"white-glove\" level cleaning or be punished, but they absolutely need to learn how to maintain a tidy living environment for their own good as it can affect their health and wellbeing as well as their future social relationships.

It would make my life so much easier now if I had built that habit before. I know we can say that we don\u2019t mind the mess, and we can still function around it, but, especially if you are ever planning to share a space with someone, having things clean is so much better all around. \n\nI wish you the best of luck!

Emotional contagion can be used when people don\u2019t properly communicate their emotions, and instead try to make you feel what they\u2019re feeling. (Ex: parent is upset that you didn\u2019t unload the dishwasher. Instead of directly telling you, they unload the dishwasher and slam the cabinets or make snide comments, then making you feel upset.) That\u2019s not fair to you. She is an adult and can communicate like one.\n\nShe also is a parent, not getting rest days is expected. However, if she needs them (every human needs rest), she can set aside time to get it. You shouldn\u2019t be guilted for not working as hard as someone who has children. \n\nAs long as you are communicating respectfully, (ex: \u201cI understand that you won\u2019t help me later this week, that is ok with me, thanks for the offer\u201d), I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole.  \n\nAll that being said, having a clean room has really improved my mental health.

Use a system like someone above explained f needed or just let clutter be clutter in the little baskets. But it keeps the clutter contained making it easier to clean and it looks more organized.\n\nTake one day a week where you frenzy through your room to vacuum completely and clean what is left to clean, this will then take far less than an hour. In fact I think you'd be done well within 30 minutes.\nThis means it can be done after school, before or after work, or on Saturday morning.

It\u2019s not fair that people with ADHD have to work significantly harder to get the basics done well, but it\u2019s what the reality is. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to say that if you\u2019re struggling to keep your space clean, you should use better strategies to deal with it. \n\nIf you have ADHD yourself, you should already know that one of the biggest things that makes certain tasks hard to complete is the irrational fear of how insurmountable it seems to you. The best way to handle that is the break it up into small chunks, and keep at it regularly. Otherwise you\u2019re going to end up under a mountain, in this case a mountain of trash, and you\u2019ll never get it done.

Things need doing, and most of my time is already taken. If they are put off, then I'm living in a filthy house, and minor repairs or projects are suddenly major and expensive problems.

If they break the rule, they clean their whole room and other household chores on top. And they also have to clean and dry every dish immediately after use.\n\nThey also deal with the consequences of messiness themselves. Like if they can't find their school shoes and we are late, I walk them in and they explain why we were late to the admin staff. Only took a few times and now they actually keep their rooms really neat and organised.\n\nThose 2 things lowered my stress levels so much and even the tiny 'clean your dishes immediately ' thing, has reduced my housework heaps.", "Teens are well known for being the age that behaved like slobs particularly with regards to their excessive amount of clothes being thrown about/left about.", "I feel that agreeing upon a once weekly room-cleaning day is fine. OP chose Wednesdays to do that, so as long as she sticks to it, no prob. \n\nMy bigger issue was chilling while OP's mum was doing work and clearly wanting help. Because at 16, OP shouldn't just be dealing with her room; she should be helping out around the house some. Which is why I suggested what I did. \n\nBut tbh, I also think teens should have some agency over their bedrooms, provided they're not compromising hygiene, causing damage, or putting up hate paraphernalia. My mum stopped prompting me to clean my room at around 11, and at first I kind of luxuriated in being able to let things stay messy. Then after a few weeks of misplacing things and constantly moving a heap of stuff from the bed to the desk or the desk to the bed depending on which I needed to use, I realized it's inconvenient and stifling for things to get too cluttered, and it made me feel bad about my space, and I started self-regulating my own cleaning. I know not every kid/teen will come to the same conclusion I did, but I think it's important to give them a chance to get into their own sustainable habit of cleaning without being prompted, even if it looks a bit different than their adults', because they'll need to do it all by themselves anyway once they move out. And setting a specific day of the week to routinely do it is a good start.", "I dunno. The first thing that pinged for me was mental health issues. Cleanliness and orderliness are often the first things to go, and from what op said about juggling advanced classes and needing to have a whole day to just relax, I\u2019d say it\u2019s likely burnout coupled with adhd and possibly depression and anxiety. She sounds like an anxious person with overload who lets stuff get \u2018bad\u2019 because she\u2019s stressed about it and doesn\u2019t know how to handle it. Obviously you\u2019d think the clear response would be to clean, but when you\u2019re so overwhelmed about multiple things, little things will tip you off and a huge way people react to it is by using the \u2018flight/freeze\u2019 response. Op is ignoring the issue of her messiness because she\u2019s overwhelmed, and she acknowledges this by noting she needs a \u2018rest day\u2019 without realising the bigger picture. It is very easy to get caught in that cycle of \u2018this stresses me out too much so I just won\u2019t think about it\u2019, especially with adhd. \n\nIt is small minded to not consider the amount of work her mother does in the household, but I think the issue here is mental health issues, not just ignorance and inconsiderate behaviour. The answer is to delve into why op feels and reacts this way over something that won\u2019t be all that time or energy costly. Maybe it *does* actually feel like a big chore to her, and that\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t think we should jump to avenues of op being spoilt/entitled/inconsiderate without thinking maybe she actually does feel over exerted.\n\nETA: I also think it\u2019s kind of weird how the mum is acting in this situation. On one hand, she should be encouraging you to clean, on the other, she\u2019s kind of over extending and going into manipulative territory. You ask your daughter, firmly, to clean her room. You ask her again and again. She doesn\u2019t. Don\u2019t guilt trip your child into doing something for herself, if she doesn\u2019t listen to you when you ask her to then just leave it and she will learn. Yelling at them everyday? Too much. You\u2019re actively discouraging her by that point. Using emotional manipulation on top of that, to toy with your kids emotions and make them dread being around you because you can\u2019t be around them without purposefully engaging in behaviours that will make them feel shitty? Sounds like the mum might be part of the problem I mentioned earlier. It\u2019s one thing to say \u2018you\u2019re not helping me out here and that\u2019s unfair, you need to pull your weight\u2019 and another thing to not be able to be in the same room as them without commenting on how much you want a rest day and can\u2019t, and how awful they make things for you, and how difficult things are. This is her room we\u2019re talking about, not the mothers. To be constantly sulking about it sounds manipulative on mums part. Something smells fishy here.", "And if her beds that messy where does she sleep?", "But the state of OPs room does not interfere with mums ability to decompress unless she chooses to.\n\nMum is always stressed because she never learned to rest and now tries to pass her anxieties to the next generation.", "Congratulations, you managed to entirely miss the point! Impressive!\n\nI don\u2019t think OP\u2019s life should suck, in fact I\u2019m glad it doesn\u2019t.

I've never understood why parents need to control the personal living space of their children.

The world doesn\u2019t revolve around what you believe.", "I had friends whose parents had never expected them to clean. They seemed genuinely unaware of mess. I visited them one week and someone had spilled gravy across the kitchen counter and floor, and they were just moving round it (no idea how -- the kitchen was tiny). I went back the next week and the gravy was still there. The number of plates of old, half eaten food I've fished out from under chairs because people just pushed them there when they were watching TV is not funny.\n\nThere's a difference between being untidy (I am) and gross. \n\nTeaching children to keep their space livable is teaching them to be functioning adults. I'm the parent of teenagers -- including a sixteen year old -- and I absolutely agree that time off is important. I also agree that it's difficult for teenagers to focus on clearing up when so many other things require their attention. However, it's not optional. It's not something that can be left for weeks while other things take priority. This is an important part of helping someone learn to look after themselves. \n\nIf I asked my teenager to clean his room and he responded as OP did, I would be very surprised and disappointed.", "Unless she has cats.

So apparently, she can't work and clean on the same day.", "You may have some different experience, but around me, it's not usually the *children* of overly controlling parents, who are eventually unhappy about the level of contact between them.", "Um...I said I** HAVE** ADHD. Nowhere did I say I didn't believe in it. I said one should get an actual diagnosis from a profit, not self diagnose, as it legitimizes it for all of us and gives OP and associated family an avenue to resources and tools to help them manage thkngs in the long run, thereby preventing it from becoming a crutch (ie: \"excuse\"). Also, I'm not sure you understand what \"gaslighting\" is. What you're saying to me may count, however, as I did not even use those words.

Like just because she doesn't have kids doesn't mean that she's lazy or not stressed.

A family is a team that the grown-ups lead via parenting and take the bulk of the hard stuff, while building the skills of the children to do their share over time. Everyone deserves rest, we all have different ways of doing things and these guys need to have a proper conversation to find a way for each of their needs to be met.", "Observant Jew here, I literally never work Friday sundown to Saturday sundown. Managed all through BS and work. Now I'm in a Masters program and still take off Saturdays to do nothing.", "That was my parents' technique as well. Made sure it was all on the bed, so I had to move it in order to sleep.", "Maybe mom doesn't have time to communicate better because she's cleaning up after everyone. I'm pretty sure she was annoyed at the time of their conversation for actually having to tell someone that a dirty room was dirty and needed cleaning.\n\nWhy does mom have to carry all of the emotional labor here? A teenager should be able to walk into a room and know it needs cleaning, and clean it or delegate correctly. At 16, direction to clean one's room should be totally unnecessary.", "No one should be expected to read anyone\u2019s mind at any age. Grown ups are responsible for communicating their own needs maturely and respectfully. The mom is 47, she is old enough to know how to communicate her expectations with her child, and also try and figure out why her kid is struggling to keep things clean. The mom is also old enough to understand that her child isn\u2019t something to control. If there are no biohazards in the room, why does she care? If anything, she should be concerned that her daughter is struggling to clean, as that can be a sign of ADHD or a mental illness. \n\nAlso, it sounds like they came to an agreement that the daughter can clean later in the week. Then the mom spent the rest of the day guilting her about it. That\u2019s emotional manipulation. With the mom going back and forth, how is the child supposed to understand the expectations?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Basically my reply to a tee", "No, they don't. It's absolutely the opposite. Back in the days no one talk about mental health, bullying, balance, estress. Now, everything is about depression, anxiety, panic. They do very much less with a lot of support.", "Yeah for real even when I was in high school ten years ago it was no joke. I went to a high performing competitive high school and it contributed to my suicidal ideation.", "Maybe if the mom communicated better she would not have to do all the cleaning on her own. But also, from the comments OP sounds like she just has trouble cleaning in her own room. It doesn\u2019t sound like she leaves the common areas a disaster. \n\nI absolutely understand the value of having a clean room, but it\u2019s the kids personal space. As long as there are no biohazards growing in there, it really only impacts OP. \n\nThe mom has to carry the emotional labor because she is the parent. People need to stop having kids if they\u2019re going to act like doing the bare minimum as a parent is such a burden. Parenting is hard and stressful, that was what the parent signed up for. The kid shouldn\u2019t feel guilted for that. People also need to stop expecting that kids are going to be more emotionally mature than their parents. Does it sound like the mom is teaching the kid how to communicate well?  She demanded her kid do something, then agreed to let her do it on a later date, then spent the rest of the day making passive aggressive comments and trying to guilt her child. From OPs other comments it sounds like the mom yells a lot too. How do you expect OP to communicate maturely? Who would have taught her how to do so?\n\nIt sounds like this 16 year old has a lot going on. If she needs a day to rest, she should take it. She did agree to do the cleaning on another day that worked better with her schedule. Assessing your own schedule and your capacity for different tasks each day to avoid burnout is a very important skill to learn.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It was much harder years ago to get to the same education you get today.  Be thankful how much technology has made your life easier.", "You don't seem to understand my point at all. No one's special for doing the \"above and beyond\" anymore, the curve is steeper every year. To me, your stuff is the bare minimum. I already go to companies (physically) and get extra education and do courses online and have a job. Education is easier to access but that just means more work to get the same stuff you did. Everyone knows how to code, everyone knows PowerPoint and everyone has been a leader.", "Because OP's preferred method of \"completely destroy my room and then only clean it once it's completely destroyed and takes 6 hours\" is obviously not working, and never will. It will just keep getting put off because it takes too long, she has other things to do, or the task is too daunting. What her mom is suggesting - clean as you go, or spend less than 30 mins each day cleaning, would actually work.\nA teenager being expected to keep their room clean is not an unreasonable requirement. If OP's preferred way of doing things is not meeting the standards then she needs to change. Saying that someone cannot also clean their room because they worked or went to school that day is ridiculous."]}
