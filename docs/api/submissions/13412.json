Sounds like you added the edit after you saw all the YTAs. Yes, neutering is good. Yes, babying a dog leads to poor behaviors in the dog. Yes, give the dog the proper prescribed medicine.

You changed everything once you saw the downvotes.", "If the edit was true it should\u2019ve been what the whole post was about and the fact that you didn\u2019t mention it at all until everyone agreed YTA makes me believe you made it up to not look bad YTA op", "**NTA** \\- The pup needs care and coddling.

That pain medication is calculated based on pet weight so under dosing will not be effective. It\u2019s also most likely something like Rimadyl which is an anti inflammatory. That\u2019s very important to help reduce swelling in the area. \n\nI worked at a vet as a receptionist and did help do some rough calculations for estimating. I can also tell you that complications are much more common in pets who are under medicated as they move more and can cause issues with the incision. Also as this may be an issue, DO NOT TAKE THE CONE OFF SOONER THAN RECOMMENDED. Opened incision from licking is another surgery you will pay for.

The dose of medication is prescribed based on your pets weight as well as countless studies looking at safety, effectiveness of different dosages, duration of action, etc.  Just like ANY medication, it needs to be given per doctor\u2019s orders in order to be effective.  Only if you are seeing negative side effects (excessive sleepiness, agitation, lack of appetite, vomiting or diarrhea) should you stop a medication and call your vet to discuss next steps.

Turned out, that decision led to the increased risk of breast cancer. Next thing I know I paid 3 thousand for her surgery, which luckily got the cancer.

Otherwise you cannot gauge how genuinely effective the medicine is at relieving the symptoms, which means you can't ever scale it back properly if your pup is more sensitive/you want to do smaller dosages/whatever else (if allowed).
