My father (59M) started dating pretty quickly after it was finalized. He introduced me to my future stepmom (SM - 58F) less than a year later. My mother (59F) kept me out of her dating life until she was serious with someone. Of the men she dated, I only met two - including my future stepdad.\n\nGrowing up, my mom and I were always close. It was just the two of us for four/five years and we did everything together. She's still my best friend to this day. My father and I didn't get that luxury. It was him, my SM, and me from the beginning. Before my father and SM got married, she was great - fun, supportive, the works. After they moved in together/got married it was like a switch flipped. Nothing I ever did was good enough - my grades, getting my clothes dirty, my room, etc. She was verbally and emotionally abusive and very manipulative. I would go from my father's house to my mother's in tears nearly every weekend. My mom always wanted to stick up for me but I told her no because I was afraid it would make things worse.\n\nIn high school, things got worse. There was s\\*lf harm, an\\*rexia, a s\\*icide attempt, the whole bit. However, I was made to feel sorry for her because she didn't realize her treatment of me could cause those issues.

It's been ten years since they've divorced and, unfortunately, things have only gotten worse us. We've both been in therapy since my HS days, and we even tried family therapy for a while. I told my father I was leaving and he accused me of running away from my problems - which I was, just not the problems he was thinking of. I told him that, if he wanted a continued relationship, I was open to it, but I refuse to talk about the past any more. I wanted to start fresh and create a new relationship on things we have in common. He said, \"that invalidates my feelings\" and he refused. We haven't talked in over a year, and while I have support from almost everyone in my support group, I have one aunt who doesn't seem to understand what happened. She's constantly telling me I should reach out and mend things. How he's my only father and god forbid something happens to him (not me, just him).
