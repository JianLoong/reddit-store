We are both currently looking for better jobs and/or something cheaper, but it is what it is right now.\n\nMy mom and wife share a birthday and there aren't words for how much my mom hates this. There was lots of whining in the beginning, jokes about can't I just get a new girlfriend, and as of right now she does her best to avoid my wife the entire week of the shared birthday. \n\nOutside of that she is a decent MIL, mostly pleasant to her but their relationship is surface level, and they could both do without the other. My mom is currently at home recovering from surgery from a torn ACL so she isn't doing much this year, though my dad got her cakes, food, and easily thousands of dollars worth of presents. \n\nMy wife has been feeling pretty down due to our living situation and some external factors and I wanted to cheer her up. I asked my dad if we could have some people over. He said yes, but to be fair I didn't specify it was for a birthday party, I'm not sure he even remembered it was my wife's birthday as he is totally disinterested in her, and he was in the middle of doing stuff for my mom who was acting very princessy about her surgery.\n\nI invited our closest friends and set up a nice little party for my wife. At some point my mom did come down and realize what was going on. I saw her look to the decorations and cake and she looked pissed. My dad quickly ushered her away and promised they would go out when she was better, but she said it wouldn't count. My dad came back out and muttered to me that I'm an asshole for doing this and called me insensitive and a mooch. He came out an hour later and shut the party down as he claimed we were being too loud. I don't think we were, but it was getting late so I didn't mind too much.\n\nMy wife loved it and had a great birthday. I fully intended on cleaning up myself but was too tired to do it that night. My mom came down in the morning and saw the things still up and got pissy again. I was in the process of cleaning them and told her not to worry I would take care of it. She just glared at me and stormed off. My dad came back down and berated me for throwing it in my mom's face that my wife got a birthday party and she didn't, and told me he can't stand me and can't wait for us to leave. I told him they are both being crazy and my mom doesn't own the date. He shot back that I tricked him as he didn't realize it was  a birthday party, to which I laughed and said maybe he should know his own DIL a bit better. He complained to some family and now my aunt and her husband are calling me an asshole as well.\n\nETA to be clear about the mess. My mom only cared because she saw birthday stuff. She has never in her life cared about a mess. She once threw a handful of glitter in her own living room. I only brought it up to let her know I wasn\u2019t planning on leaving it for the housekeeper as I thought that would be disrespectful", "created_utc": 1667684529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn74o3/aita_for_throwing_my_wife_a_birthday_party_and/", "score": 8819, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Coz I think you\u2019re very much N T A for throwing your wife a little party, but I get why people are saying Y T A for doing so when you knew it would piss your mom off while you\u2019re living under her roof. \n\nPersonally I get the feeling that your folks are super toxic - looking at your mom\u2019s weird possessive behaviour over the birthday date and your dad\u2019s ambivalence towards your wife. But what\u2019s happening is that you sound very used to the toxicity: kind of used to just tolerating it, thinking less of the parents for it, navigating around it, occasionally revenging yourself upon them for it, etc. This happens when you grow up with toxic family. But the problem is that these little revenges do kind of make an AH of you, at least to outsiders. Hence the Y T A judgments here. \n\nHave a think about if this could be the case, and have a chat to the wife. Think about whether the financial benefits of staying with your folks, are really worth turning you into the kind of people who wilfully do things that you know will upset the very people who are putting a roof over your head.", "YTA. You intentionally asked your dad for permission and chose to be vague, because you knew your mum would be displeased. Your mum who\u2019s recovering from major surgery too, whose birthday it also was. Was literally every restaurant in your city/town, or within driving distance in nearby cities/towns, closed? It\u2019s their house so you need to grow up and show some respect.", "ESH. You should have been honest about what the party was for. But your parents are the bigger assholes here. What is the girl supposed to do apologize forever for being born on that date? Your moms nuts and you guys need to get out of their asap.", "How did your mother get to this age with such massive immaturity? Good Lord.", "Is your mother a child??", "Hmm. I have no opinion at all on the party, but your parents are clearly not happy having you live with them (calling you a mooch, can't wait for you to leave, etc.). So why are you still there when you are so unwelcome?  Don't you have any alternatives?", "I\u2019m sorry I disagree with a lot of these people. NTA your wife can celebrate HER birthday. Your mom doesn\u2019t own the date just because she was born first.", "ESH.\n Mom is weird she doesn\u2019t own the date , however you did something you knew would upset them in their own house. Even if it\u2019s irrational it is there house and you are being a mooch. So leaning more to YTA but a grown ass woman being this mad about a shared birthday is weird too.", "YTA. You live with your parents (rent free? Or paying rent & expenses?) - I\u2019m guessing rent free since your own father called you a mooch. You had a party that you knew your parents wouldn\u2019t like so you misled them about what kind of party it was. Then you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to clean up before you went to bed so your parents woke up to party debris. You called your mother \u201cprincessy\u201d because you don\u2019t like the way her husband is taking care of her after her surgery. I can see why they can\u2019t wait for you to move out.\n\nBy the way, it sounds like you & your wife did nothing to celebrate your mom in her birthday. After all, what are she & your dad doing for you except giving you a place to live when you can\u2019t afford one on your own.", "YTA, because while your mother is being kind of a drama queen about this, *you* made completely avoidable poor choices that aggravated the situation and made life difficult for your poor dad, completely unnecessarily at that!\n\nFirst, you did *not* have to have your wife\u2019s birthday party at your parents\u2019 house at all. You could have taken her out for a nice dinner somewhere or gotten a good friend of hers/yours/both of you to host a party. What I\u2019m saying is there were options for keeping wife\u2019s birthday celebration both out of sight and out of mind for your parents. But no, you had to have it in their *house.*\n\nSecond, I don\u2019t care how tired you were, you should have gotten on cleanup duty right away. You are their adult child who they are allowing to stay in their home. Whatever it is you were doing there, you clean it up, promptly and thoroughly, that\u2019s the rule.\n\nDo something nice for your mom for your birthday for God\u2019s sake. Take her out, without your wife, and give her a present. And *make better choices* in the future.", "INFO: You say that *your dad* gives your mom presents. Do you also give her a card and/or present each year?\n\nIf not, *that* is why she's upset, not because your wife has the same birthday... and you are definitely the AH in that case. \ud83d\ude44 She sees you giving your wife gifts and understandably is hurt that her own child is ignoring her Birthday. I think my judgment depends on the answer to this.\n\nI send both my parents a card every year and sometimes a hand knit present since I knit. I don't have kids, but the little things mean a lot to parents.", "Info do you two pay rent?", "ESH but man oh man your parents clearly don\u2019t want you guys there.  You\u2019d be double the AH if you stayed and they\u2026they just sound like AHs.", "Sucks that they can't celebrate it together. It is a fucking birthday ,for Christ's sake", "I don\u2019t understand of being jealous of your wife\u2019s birthday. It seems immature.", "ESH - do any of you people even like each other at all? What an absolutely toxic family dynamic.", "NTA. Are y\u2019all serious? OP didn\u2019t do anything wrong. His mother is bitter and mean.", "NTA. You did something kind for your wife and your mom is behaving like a childish jerk. Your father is enabling her bad behavior.", "NTA. You are allowed to celebrate you wife. Your mom doesn't own the day.", "LOL all these y t a comments can kindly F off. NTA my dude but your parents certainly are, honestly why are you still in contact with them? I\u2019d be low contact, and I would not be living with them.", "Regardless of relationships it feels incredibly rude to not even acknowledge that it was also your mother\u2019s birthday, when she\u2019s letting you live in her house. Why couldn\u2019t you have celebrated them both? Why not have the party literally anywhere else? YTA for wanting to rub it in and make your mom angry.", "2 questions- What are everyone's ages? And are you residing in the lower level/basement?\nJust curious about ages because I don't understand how people beyond a certain age are so wound up about their bday. I'm 45 and hardly care about mine. I'd be super happy to celebrate a daughter in law on mine!\nI'm curious about where you are in the house since you said \"came down\". If you're residing on the lower level, is this an area that your parents usually don't hang out in?", "NTA. So many are missing what the issue is here. It was never about them celebrating her birthday. It was about MIL being jealous that someone else gets attention on her birthday.  She got her gifts, she got her attention. But she cant seem to stand it when someone else gets it as well. There is no way FIL didnt know it was the wifes birthday too, so him pretending to not know it was going to be a birthday party is BS.", "NTA. Sounds like your mom really needs to grow up.", "YTA. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for putting one's spouse before one's parents, but you live in your parents' home (meaning they help you out in a difficult situation), were vague about the occasion (so you knew this was going to be an issue) and decide to throw your wife a birthday party while not even gifting a card to your mother. On top of that, you didn't clean up the mess right away. \n\nMom's TA for being weird about the shared birthday, but in the end, you made a poor choice. Don't bite the hand that feeds you.", "You're living there and your dad called you a mooch, so I'm assuming you don't pay much rent. Your mum just had surgery. You threw a party and didn't clean up. Yeah, YTA.", "NTA Your mom needs to grow up. I\u2019ve literally seen children behave better when not having things go their way on their birthdays. Frankly adults who behave the way your mother is over their birthday are raging narcissists imo.", "NTA. I wish for your speedy exit from that home.", "NTA, but your mother, well,  hope your out of her house soon!", "NTA  \n\nUnder these circumstances no matter what you did. Your mom will find somethings bad too say. Sorry your battling between picking and choosing your wife or mother..\n\nApologize and thank them for their support and move out. Say i understand its difficult to share your burthday with my wife and understand that you don't want anything to do with us. I respect yours and dads choices too not be part of our lives. And move out.", "NTA.  Your parents are ridiculous.  I haven't expected (or had) a birthday party since I was 12 or 13.  \n\nFor your wife's sake, find a cheap place to rent soon.  She doesn't deserve to be treated poorly by your parents.", "NTA - your mother is a narcissist. She's been complaining since the beginning of your relationship because she happens to share a birthday with your wife. \n\nYou wanted to do something nice for your wife and your mom can't handle someone else getting attention and having some fun. \n\nYour mom needs therapy and your dad is an enabler.

Nobody can share her birthday?", "[removed]", "NTA Your father and mother both sound like snobs.", "NTA. But get outta there yesterday", "NTA.  Why are people so fixated on getting attention? Jeez.

Trauma is not an excuse for toxic behavior.", "Same. I know I'll get the Thanksgiving and winter holiday cash bonus from work soon but I could use some more of that hatred and bitterness now lol", "He could have it at a public park. It\u2019s fine to spend a little money even while aggressively saving, and given the fact the party had decorations, he did just that. Could\u2019ve even gone to some of those friends and asked them for the favor of hosting a potluck or something for his wife.", "He could have asked a friend if they would host. It would have been a lot more difficult though.", "Stop telling on us.", "YTA in a major way and we're totally disrespectful of your parents and their home. Your mom is recovering from a painful operation and you called her a princess but it's ok that your wife is depressed that you have to live with your parents so she gets a party? You sound ungrateful and entitled and you probably should be making arrangements to move out before you get thrown out.", "The mom is jealous and the dad is playing right in her hand. NTA by a long shot.", "Agree! How pathetic to have the expectation no one else can celebrate their big day!", "I agree with this. I sort of have a similar situation but I was born in my mother's birthday and she always said to me 'it was my birthday first!' and it was always about her. Like excuse me for being born. Everyone deserves to have their own birthday regardless who they share it with. Nta op and your mom is a spoiled brat.", "It's a bit like my MiL who organised a Christmas party at her place couple of years ago. She's born on Christmas Day, we celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve here. \n\nMiL is not known for being the most organised person so we were prepared to potluck. She refused, got catering. She didn't mention that this was supposed to also be her birthday celebration. She specifically said Christmas, got Christmas catering, we did secret Santa, etc. Invited the whole family, including two small kids under 4 and an autistic grandchild, who is not on a light end of the spectrum. \n\nAnyways, as usual everything got belated, she wasn't even done with vacuuming when first guests started arriving and her kids ended up helping with the cleaning. They weren't done before we came, an hour latter than she said it will be starting! A whole fuckery ensued as expected. She had little kids waiting for a meal that was supposed to be at ~6pm until well past 8pm. There was no catering involved in the end, just some deep fried snacks, fries and a salad she made. The biggest yikes for me though was her literally crying in front of the whole family, because we dared ask what time will the dinner be when she started opening HER Christmas present claiming it's also her birthday celebration. She couldn't wait, she said. She was okay with making toddlers and an autistic child wait 2 hours for a dinner without any snacks. \n\nWe said fuck it and went to get McDonald's. She was not amused when we came back, but it was a good call. \"Dinner\" was just being made, kids were crying and everyone else, but us was complying with this insanity. Yeah, she did open her present before everyone else even got to eat, let alone open their present. Needless to say this was our last Christmas at her place. Her, then, boyfriend was more concerned for the kids, than her, a mother of 5.", "What psycho would tell you to date someone different because your birthday is on the same day? If I had kids and one of them came home with a significant other with my same birthday I would love that shit", "Totally agree...\nNTA", "Aside from the number of people OP had over, I also haven't seen anyone address the nature of the party. A lot of people are commenting that OP is TA simply for not also inviting his mother. But I think it depends entirely on the party itself.\n\nFor ex:\n- Did the mom know any of the guests? If OP only invited his wife's friends over for an informal get-together (mom doesn't know the guests) then NTA. It wouldn't be appropriate to specifically tell anyone living in the home they CAN'T join the party, but this situation doesn't warrant making the event a joint birthday party. It would probably be pretty awkward for mom to hang out with a bunch of people in their early 20s (especially since OP has said his mom has a lot of anxiety).\n- If someone had a more formal party, either a nice dinner or a large party (all the common spaces in a house full of people), it's appropriate to specifically invite everyone who lives in the house.\n- If guests included other family members (siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins,...) who are related to both people whose birthday it is, but only one birthday person is invited, than that's crap.\n\nThe OP says there were 15 guests. Based on other comments, 15 guests doesn't sound like a large party for his parents' home. (I realize I'm making assumptions here.) He grew up being raised by a nanny, and his dad's giving his mom thousands of dollars in birthday presents, so they probably have a large house. Many people I know in similar situations can host 15 people in their kitchen and living room without feeling cramped (that few people is a disappointingly low turnout for a lot of my friends). Fifteen people would be a large party if it's a two bedroom house, but it doesn't sound like that's the situation.", "She couldn\u2019t have a party the day after surgery and won\u2019t accept anything at a later date", "Is the father completely devoid of common sense? The son (OP) asked to have friends over on his wife's birthday. Any reasonable person would have puzzled out that the get-together was to celebrate the wife's birthday. It's crazy that anyone asserts the dad didn't know what the party was for. The whole family knows that the wife shares a birthday with the mom and clearly the dad remembered the date (since he purchased his wife (the mom) presents).", "Right like the second I read the first paragraph it was apparent to me that the Mom was TA.", "I can promise you my MIL would have no interest hanging out with my friends on her or my birthday. Op\u2019s MIL is just being petty because she thinks she owns the day and doesn\u2019t like being reminded other people exist", "The parents will probably just kick op out than", "This! Why should op have to take his moms pathetic behavior just because he lives **temporarily** in her house. Op didn\u2019t show up with a u-haul unannounced either, he lives there with his wife because his parents agreed to that arrangement. Plus this isn\u2019t an isolated incident, his mother ignores his wife **every year for a week** simply because she dared to be born on the same day?", "they\u2019ll win the battle but lose the war when they inevitably go into the nursing home. and he won\u2019t be wrong for it either", "From OP's post:  My mom is currently at home recovering from surgery from a torn ACL so she isn't doing much this year, though my dad got her cakes, food, and easily thousands of dollars worth of presents. FIL ignored DIL's birthday.", "Or they setup in home care with their retirement and donate their estate after death to a worthy charity so AH son doesn't get a dime... Happened in my extended family", "Except OP didn't mention his mom having a traumatic childhood. She's just narcissistic and has to have the world revolve around her at all times.", "Definitely, his parents are going to suck the joy right out of both his and his wife's lives.", "Right? I'm lucky to get a card and a \"happy birthday\" from my hubs.", "You don't have to \"spend money on a venue\" to go to a restaurant with friends.", "Also, OP throws a party in their house and doesn't bother offering for them to join? It would be a simple gesture, they'd have the opportunity to shut it down if it bothered them, and MIL would not have been surprised when she came down.", "It\u2019s wild that so many people like you really seem to think moving to a lower cost of living area is even possible for people who are struggling. I live in an incredibly low cost of living area and we still struggle; do you think we could be able to afford to another area? Hell no. Some of y\u2019all really need to pull your heads out of your asses. Parents are being complete assholes, OP is just trying to get by and y\u2019all are taking his parents side? When he literally does what a man is supposed to do and be there for his WIFE? But if he had taken his mamas side y\u2019all would be all up in these comments calling him a mama\u2018s boy saying that his wife should leave him. OP, NTA", "I don't think you understand that just moving isn't an option when you are already struggling. It's almost like there's been 50 years of stagnant wages and skyrocketing housing costs or something.", "It\u2019s still more expensive than a party at home. Because you pay for the venue.", "I don't think you understand many of us actually have moved, in all kinds of situations.  Just because something is difficult or not ideal doesn't mean it is not an option.  Everything has trade-offs.  Live further away because it's cheaper means longer commutes or less access to some things you like (certain restaurants or theaters, etc), still takes time, maybe even still need to be in a tiny studio apartment or a basement apartment of someone's house.  You may not be able to do anything outside of working, sleeping, and apartment hunting until you find it, so no time with friends, or relaxing, and so on.  It's not easy, but it still can be done.", "You do not pay for the venue to go out to dinner? Where the fuck do you live that going to a restaurant with 8-10 people requires a venue payment? I didn't say rent a room. I said go to dinner. Most you'd pay for was your own dinner and that of your partner. Which considering he got decorations and food and shit to have it at his parents house...", "Who cleans up the same day they have the party?  Not me!", "Exactly, like some of us haven't had the luxury of living with parents as adults and we still managed to survive somehow. And I was in college during the recession, so it's not like I'm some out of touch boomer who got to live through easy economic times. Yup it's gonna suck and be hard, but there's gotta be some other solution besides living there.", "If I had thrown a birthday party for my wife in someone else's house, when is also the owner's birthday, the owner being my parents and me not even celebrating my mom's birthday? I would definitely leave everything spotless.", "Ok imma go against grain here: you cannot afford to live on your own yet you got married and moved back home? Then you made an elaborate party that you didn\u2019t bother to clean up after for? So of course mom would feel the need to do so just after surgery? Why didn\u2019t you take your wife out somewhere else to make a huge mess you didn\u2019t have to clean up? Yeah you kinda the AH here. Yes mom was wrong in her way but I\u2019d be mad you had a party I couldn\u2019t attend but had to clean up after. Oh and it\u2019s moms bday too? Yes YTA.", "AGREED. also I like how mom is princessy after surguey and they made a huge mess with the huge party and didn\u2019t bother to clean it up.", "My ex-MIL made Mother's Day all about her, despite all the grandchildren. If the DIL's didn't come to kiss the ring, you were berated and treated worse than usual.", "So what? The party didn't involve her. She didn't have to plan it, attend it, clean up after it, nothing. Her surgery and recovery shouldn't be relevant to them having a small party.", "Millions of people share your birthday. If birthdays are evenly spread throughout the year approximately 22 million people share your birthday.", "I only said that because you said the could've had a small party.", "Can someone explain this logic? Serious question. His parents raised him, fed him, kept a roof over his head, continues to put a roof over his head as an adult and his wife\u2019s too. But they don\u2019t care about his wife\u2019s bday so they\u2019re the only assholes? I\u2019m not saying his mom isn\u2019t wrong for how she acted. But I\u2019m confused why so many people think his parents suck because they don\u2019t want to celebrate his wife\u2019s bday. Like in my books they\u2019ve exceeded the expectations of parents.", "And I stand by my statement. She could've had one before her surgery (I'm assuming it was scheduled) or once she was starting to feel better. Or even just had some friends over to distract her after the surgery.", "I wouldn't be surprised if she kicked them out cause op said his mom never liked him. And it's her house", "I recently read about a couple that lives on cruise ships because it's cheaper than rent.", "Your mother\u2019s HUSBAND could have easily made her birthday special and he didn\u2019t. I fail to see how OP is the AH for catering to his literal wife.", "Oh please he was absolutely wrong to \"ask\" his dad when he was distracted if he could \"have some friends over\" when he wanted to throw a party", "Yeah, I think the wife should be allowed to celebrate her birthday and all...but OP sucks because he didn't get permission to host a party at their house. He got permission to have a few friends over. There IS a difference between having a few people over and having a party and the homeowners should have had a clear say in that and been asked clearly about it. And then he didn't clean up and insisted the mess was fine because his mother has thrown glitter in her house before?", "The wife is a freeloader, completely cool with her husband\u2019s blatant disrespect of his parents. I wonder if she will be cool with it when mom kicks them to the curb.", "Agreed! OP is a massive AH.\n\nIf someone is staying in MY house and throwing parties and doesn't ask me for MY permission, they are getting kicked out. OP is hella entitled.\nI don't want strangers in my home, people I have not agreed to coming over.\n\nOP was deliberately vague and instead of a couple of people for dinner like he asked his Dad, it's an actual party. Big difference.\nMom should be able to recover and rest without the stress of the noise and worry.\n\nOP's an unreliable narrator for sure, basically calling his Mom who has every right to feel uncomfortable with strangers in her home 'princessy', while he and wife are living at Mom and Dad's RENT FREE. Leaving all the party stuff up in someone else's home after they already said no, what a AH move on top of being a massive AH anyway. Who throws a frigging party in the home of someone who is trying to recover and on their own birthday?? He makes no mention of having done anything for his own Mom either. What an absolute dik.\n\nOP's a brat and both him and his wife are mooches. They might be in their 20's but they act like selfish bratty teenagers. No wonder the parents don't like them.\n\nI hope the parents kick OP and wife out for being so insensitive and disgustingly entitled and ungrateful in their own home.", "It makes me want them to have a child and the CHILD\u2019S bday is also the same day. It would crack me the fuck up to see this grown ass MIL realize that her bday becomes less and less significant.\n\nAnd MIL could have been super cool and they threw joint bdays and just went all out. Made the men treat them like queens for the day or what have you, but no. MIL is apparently a 6 year old and didn\u2019t pass sharing in Kindergarten.", "That's okay, I learned most of the acronyms by someone else asking the question.  For some reason I never paid attention to the sidebar until someone pointed it out.", "That\u2019s a pretty privileged stance to take. Not everyone can afford to just pick up and move.", "I mean, I lived in an unheated (illegal) apartment in Boston. I know what it\u2019s like to struggle, but you put your head down and try to pull out of it. Regardless of how difficult it is, OP\u2019s family can kick them out at anytime, so they better be working and saving.", "Wages are stagnant. I hope OP\u2019s parents are not charging rent, so they can scrounge up enough for first, last and deposit\u2026because that is where they are headed. I love it when family helps out, but OP and his wife are adults and may be in their own soon enough.", "Plus, there's often a 24-hour buffet going. If I liked cruising, that would be a tempting way to spend retirement. Plus, when I die my wife could just drop my body off the back end of the ship and save the expense of embalming and a burial plot.\n\nYou know, that sort of life is looking more attractive all the time. ;-)", "That\u2019s a fact, if he did say it was for his wife\u2019s birthday the FIL 100% would\u2019ve come up with some bs excuse that they can\u2019t have people over , but when he doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a celebration, he\u2019s okay with OP having people over.", "I don\u2019t know about you\u2026but if I go out for a birthday dinner it costs me the cost of my meal. It\u2019s cheaper than hosting a party at home. Generally everyone pays for their own meal. The decorations are minimal. People buy their own drinks.\n\nI think a restaurants would be cheaper but less personal and likely wouldn\u2019t be something \u201cspecial\u201d to cheer her up. The night would likely be briefer too.", "Plus the way I took it the MIL didn't celebrate her birthday as much as usual because she's trying to rest and recover from surgery and someone throws a party in her home. That she wasn't even invited to lol also OP blames his parents for not acknowledging his wife's birthday but did him or his wife acknowledge the MILs either?", "Uhm.. the nice thing to do here is to celebrate YOUR bday also, precisely because your family isnt close. \n\n\ud83e\udd79 thats what we would do in my family anyway", "It\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re being intentionally obtuse.\n\nIf he had that kind of money to burn he obviously wouldn\u2019t be living in his parents house, as they don\u2019t exactly sound all that nice to be around either.", "NO YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME! YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE!!", "Damn it. So we weren't supposed to get weirdly excited?"]}
