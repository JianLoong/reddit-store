If a homeless teenager asks me to help them, even if it's a stranger, I think I would try as much as I could. It's a terrible thing that can potentially ruin their entire life, and if you have the resources to help them u probably should. That said it's not your responsibility, u don't owe her anything.", "NTA\n\nThere are literally hundreds of thousands of homeless. It sucks. Helping each person individually is not going to fix this problem. It is, in my opinion, disgusting for a 1st World country not to deal with this problem at a political policy level.\n\nLetting her stay is not likely to help long term. It may well ruin your life in the process - she has no love for you, she will likely be drunk, disrespectful, possibly abusive and cause damage. Tangible help would be child protection or the equivalent where you are so people better trained and equipped to help can take her on, and spending time to find out what she needs. Is she an alcoholic? Or does she need booze for someone else? What happened with the aunt? Was she genuinely at fault, or was her aunt to blame? Does she have anybody to help he process her grief? What issues does she have that helped her fall into this situation, or stop her finding her way out?\n\nIf you want to make the world a better place, there are other things you can do. Volunteering at shelters isn't solving the underlying problem, but saves lives and makes things a little better none the less. Lobbying your local political representative or campaigning in some other way for change may help, but considering most people's attitudes to homeless, it will be a long fight and you are busy engaged in your own life and survival, with no safety net of your own.", "Good deeds never go unpunished.

That being said, letting her come live with you after she\u2019s asked for money and alcohol raises a lot of red flags. Can you keep in touch with her? Take her to dinner once in awhile if you can, get her in touch with a county social worker, even just make sure she has access to a shower or offer to do laundry for her. \n\nIt\u2019s completely possible to support people while also maintaining boundaries. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA.

I think that it's taken you all this time to get to a place where you've got your own place and you feel comfortable and happy in it so you should enjoy it, guilt free. NTA.", "NTA.  Also if you let her in you\u2019ll end up robbed and I judge this on basis of her asking you fir money and to buy her grog. Any money she\u2019d take advantage of you and trash your place. Don\u2019t give her money or let her know where you live.", "NTA, call CPS. You can\u2019t just let a minor stay in your house, her guardian could accuse you of kidnapping B or god knows what else.", "NTA -1. you don\u2019t have the money past your own utilities, so where are you going to get the money for her? \n2. She needs to go into thd foster care system so her drinking and risk taking behaviour is taken seriously by people qualified", "NTA", "NTA\n\nOh you know what she\u2019s like, shes only texted you for a bit and shes already proven to be an entitled brat who does illegal shit in obvious, stupid and easy to be caught by the cops ways. She absolutely will get you into trouble.", "NTA. You said that she was kicked out before because she was disrespectful; if she's that way to an older adult, she'll certainly be that way with you. She already showed you by asking you for stuff not 10 minutes after getting your number that she only seems to see you as a means to get things, unless you've seen something that indicates that's not the case any more? By your own admission, you know nothing about her, so yes, she is a stranger, and you have no obligation to reach out if you feel it wouldn't be a good idea. I understand you don't want the same trauma on her, but if she had a roof and she lost it, it's not the same thing, nor is it your fault.", "NTA.\n\nBut you should probably call CPS.\n\nThis situation is complicated, and if you do not want to deal with it, then you are not going to help her.\n\nThis girl, being 16, and addicted to alcohol is going through a lit right now. She needs help, and probably treatment.\n\nShe is alone in the world that she is not prepared for, and you feeling obligated to take her in isn't going to help either of you.\n\nI would recommend telling her that you cannot afford to take her in, or your lease is only for one person, but still be there as support but only if she is going to work towards bettering herself.\n\nIf you can, send her to resources where she can get a job, free counseling, help with housing, etc.", "NTA she texted you right away to ask for money, she's a user.", "I'm unclear on how old OP was when B's Mom kicked them out, but if they were under the age of majority CPS should be told that as well.

But I think she's alone and could really use some guidance. You've been in her shoes before and understand how frightening and stressful being homeless as a teenager can be. You're not obligated to open your home to her, but if you can help in any way, it'll probably turn her life around in a positive way.", "NTA. Absolutely do not let her know where you live. It\u2019s true that CPS will not usually take any action with minors at this age unless they want the help. Because they just run away. You can offer her information about where to get help. \nJust based on the fact that she asked you for money after 8 years of nc, and then asked you to do something illegal, this is not a person you want in your home. I may sound heartless, but I work with these kind of kids. They won\u2019t do anything productive until they want it. Hopefully she will take the help offered by local social services.", "NTA \n\nYou would have been the ah, of she had asked politely because she doesn't know where else to go. But in the short time of contact she has asked directly about money and alcohol! If she were to move in she would definitely only use you.

She's trying to bum money, get you to buy her alcohol, and wanting to crash with you? If she was kicked out for disrespect, what makes you think she'd be respectful of your wishes, or you for that matter. She is parasitic.

You don't owe her anything and she just wants to use you. Be cautious!", "NTA- it will be a nightmare, she will be a parasite and make your life miserable, she could destroy the apartment and make you homeless again.\nShe was young, but we was part of the family unit that made you homeless.\n\nIf cps says she needs to contact them, forward her cps\u2019 number and ask them to help.", "NTA.. send her the number for CPS tell that they may be able to help her which you are not giving her a place to live or money", "You should have given her a fake number and walked away", "But the cousin did have help - an aunt .

Recommending shelters for her to have a same place to spend the night, or encouraging her to call cps to get help might be the best course", "She cannot let her even know where she lives. This will not end well. She cannot take her in. This cousin will ruin her. The kid goes through people because she was raised to see people as resources and not people. You cannot help people like that because they are leeches.", "We honestly do not know the full story.\n\nWhen I say help, I mean professional help.\nI am in no way trying to say that the OP should take responsibility other than contacting CPS.", "That's true. Then the 2nd option is more feasible or OP should make the aunt aware what's happening and then remove herself completely from this situation", "I misunderstood then.", "NTA. If you let her stay with you, she will probably start stealing from you.

I'm not going to judge you for not choosing to let her into your life, because that's your choice and it's perfectly valid. But it would be best if you thought long and hard about what you think is the right thing *for you* to do. Not the moral choice, but the choice you'll be able to live with.  \n\nI think (and this is only a projection of my own indecisiveness, so feel free to disagree with me), you're looking for somebody to tell you what to do because you don't want to make that difficult decision for yourself. But you're the one who has to live with it and not any of the people here telling you what to do.\n\nI'd suggest you choose whether to let her live with you or not by yourself, taking into account everything (and this is including information you're probably not going to be able to tell us, or even articulate.

Is there anybody else willing to help her out should you inform them of her circumstances?", "Nta. Run from this entire part of your family.

She had a place to stay she fucked it up.", "Where is the grandma, that let her stay and kicked you out?", "It\u2019s not your fault or responsibility that this 16yo is in this situation.
