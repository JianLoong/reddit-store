I'm sure she has many great qualities but from this post your girlfriend sounds kind of awful.", "I can\u2019t weigh in because I can\u2019t imagine this situation.\n\n1.

Good luck!", "if part of the fun is unwrapping the present, I don't get how a nice gift bag with some tissue paper scrunched in the top doesn't achieve the same thing honestly. \n\nI am also garbage at wrapping presents. I've tried my whole life to be better at it but I don't seem to have the dexterity for it. if we have to give a present to someone else, my husband will wrap it. for each other we don't bother with wrapping because we take the same view as you that the important thing is the actual gift.\n\nyou gave it an honest try because it was important to her. it's just not true that you didn't put any effort into it - you said you took multiple tries to get it as good as you could. she's being unreasonable and a bit weird about this imo.\n\nNTA", "NTA. GF is focused on the wrapping, rather than the gift or the meaning of gift-giving at Christmas. Gift bags are fine.", "NTA.  For all the people saying, \u201cJust watch a video or it\u2019s not that hard.\u201d  Well, how awesome for you that you can do that. I can do things too that seem super easy to me and others can\u2019t.  Doesn\u2019t mean they are lazy or aren\u2019t trying.  I can\u2019t wrap presents well.  My brain knows what to do, but my hands aren\u2019t cooperating. But, that\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t need to be good at everything. Luckily, my husband is good at wrapping so he picks up the slack on things I\u2019m not good at and vice versa.  \n\nAnd you can\u2019t just always learn something by watching a video. Sometimes it\u2019s just wrong information or it\u2019s hard to follow what they are trying to show you.", "NTA. I, too, am bad at wrapping gifts. My husband thinks it's funny and offers to help wrap the gifts to my friends/family so they don't look shitty. It's not something worth getting annoyed with you over.", "NTA, and this is so sad. Your gf is a fool not to see the effort you put in, and an AH for pouting about it. She's missing the whole point of giving gifts.", "NTA. You said you weren't good at wrapping gifts and wanted to use gift bags instead. She insisted and so you attempted to wrap it. She's in the wrong.", "NTA. She knew that you aren't into wrapping presents, but she insisted anyway. You made the effort and it still didnt' come out as pretty as she would have liked. Then she gets an attitude and accuses you of not trying when you did try. Perfectly wrapped presents are very beautiful but they dont' make the gift better or worse if anything it makes you not want to open it because its too beautiful to ruin. \n\nShe is trying to control how you do things because it is how she does things and thats not right. You need to have a talk with her about her accusations. She never should have accused you of not trying unless she was there and knows for a fact you didn't try. Maybe instead of getting all pissy about how you wrap the better solution would have been to say \" hey i know you have problems wrapping would you mind if i gave you some pointers?\" This way you either learn or she sees that you truly aren't good at it.", "Why was there even a conversation about gift wrapping in the first place? You saying, \"Hey! Let's use bags!\" Makes no sense. I don't think it is usual to discuss how you will wrap a gift with the recipient, there are very few reasons to. And why would they need to be coordinated?  Does she have to buy the wrapping for you? \n\nI don't understand this story. It feels like one of those, \"look at this entitled and irrational woman!\" troll post to see the arguments about how much AITA hates men.", "NTA.  The fact that your partner thinks ONLY a wrapped present (as opposed to a gift bag or other packaging) is acceptable is entitled, bratty, and pathetic.  A gift is a gift, doesn't matter how it's presented.  For her to say you made no effort, yet she got gifts she wanted, is ridiculous.\n\nThe amount of YTA's is mind boggling.  She is completely ungrateful and I don't know how or why you put up with that!", "She sounds like she's being over the top. How bad was the wrapping? Fairly presentable doesn't sound great, but its hard to say.", "NTA. I take pride in my ability to wrap presents. I probably go a little over the top too. My partner uses gift bags. They are not good at wrapping presents. I have seen them try to wrap- they really do try, but the results still look messy. Not everyone is good at wrapping! It does take some skill that you can't get just from watching a video.\n\nShe asked for them to be wrapped, fine. OP did that and put in time and effort, then she criticized the results. She is in the wrong and the AH here.", "NTA but your GF is. You told her you weren\u2019t good at wrapping but tried. My Dad was terrible at wrapping but none of us cared. It was the thought that counted.", "NTA, everyone saying \u201cit\u2019s not that hard\u201d isn\u2019t taking into account that different people have different abilities. My brother and I are both dyspraxic and no matter how hard we try the presents we exchange always look like they\u2019ve been wrapped by a T-Rex. \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s the gift that matters. It\u2019s nice to have something to open though so if your gf would like the experience of opening her presents then do keep wrapping them instead of using a bag. Relationships are compromise and it\u2019s fair for you to keep trying with the wrapping whilst she deals with them not looking as picture perfect as she\u2019d like.", "NTA\n\nWrapping presents is fucking hard man, its an art.", "Ah.. NTA you can give me the badly wrapped presents. \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude0d\n\nEdit to add my multiple worthless cents:\nI\u2019m relatively good at wrapping gifts, but I too find it a chore.

(NOT the same as, but similar!) Because you just decided you\u2019re bad it at it and than half assed wrapped your girlfriends presents after she told you it was important to her. \n\nAll you do have to is google a video. Look at a 5 step Infograph. Not even that?? It\u2019s wrapping paper not rocket science. It\u2019s not complicated and anyone *barring disabilities* can do it I promise.\n\nUnless her standards are ridiculously I\u2019m guessing she just want a normal amount of wrapping to have been done. Set the box in the middle of the paper, cut a little extra with a pair of scissors no ripping the paper to cut it, and fold\u2026 nobody cares if your corners aren\u2019t even. Just don\u2019t wrinkle or rip the paper. Mostly it just takes a little patience. Something which you likely don\u2019t have since you decided you were going to do it badly from the start.\n\nI see that you say you wrapped them multiple times, I just have a hard time believing the amount of effort you really put into it because it\u2019s hard to imagine your girlfriend actively calling you out for it unless it was really *that* bad.", "ESH. \n\nWrapping presents in a simple neat manner is not that hard. There's no reason to make \"bad at wrapping presents\" into a whole personality trait. Just watch a video if you can't figure out how to do it. \n\nWhy does the gf require presents to be wrapped rather than in a gift bag? Telling another person how to give you your presents is strange and controlling. \n\nIt sounds to me like both of you were trying to start a fight. She forced you to wrap the presents so in return you did a bad job wrapping. Then she gets upset over the wrapping job and you get upset that she's upset about the wrapping job.\n\nDo you both even like each other or do you enjoy bickering on holidays?", "Info: do you have a habit of not really trying when it comes to things you don\u2019t care about or dont want to do?", "NTA\n\nIf she's still in your life next year use Gorilla shipping tape to wrap her gifts.\n\nLots of it because it'll make it Lots of Fun just like she expects.", ">I am terrible at wrapping gifts...I told her I would give it a go but not to expect too much...multiple attempts because I'm that bad...I had already mentioned they wouldn't look amazing but it does the job.\n\nYTA. Ah, the old \"excuses in advance\" approach. Tried-and-true method to get out of doing things you just don't like (works great for cooking too).\n\n --->Wrapping a gift decently isn't some innate talent.  It can be learned.  It gets better with practice.  Buying paper/tissue/ribbon/bows/tags pretty much ensures the end result will be nice. My kids managed this from probably age 8, and you're an adult.\n\nYou've probably got 2 more chances to course-correct on this issue: Valentine's Day and her birthday. If you can't do better, then she needs to quit pouting about it and move on.", "NTA.

It's not that hard. But since I don't have a reference photo of said wrapping, I can't tell if her expectations were too high. Still, it's a small thing you know makes her happy. Everyone and their mother knows relationships require active participation, and you failed on this one. Do better and you'll be fine.", "YTA. Weaponized incompetence at its finest.

Boxes are so much easier than odd shaped items or soft items.\nBit no, you're NTA. You tried and that's all that matters.", "NTA  \n\n\nThe best answer so far is \"Pay to have someone else wrap the gifts so they look good.\".   \nTBH, I'm impressed that someone made the effort to go shopping and find gifts for me that a gift bag is fine.

Not one ounce of effort was put in here, then SHE gets called ungrateful and selfish.", "Is She 15?", "NTA run now", "NTA, I wrap terribly, and also like giving gifts in bags. I have family members who prefer paper, so I wrap it, I give it one shot, because why the hell would I waste paper doing multiple attempts wrapping the same thing only for it to get ripped up anyway? They\u2019re far from perfect, but I tried and I refuse to waste a bunch of paper on the same present!", "NTA. There are often charities set up in malls that will wrap your gifts for you.

You may even be able to put out a call for help on a local Facebook group and someone will volunteer to wrap them for you.\n\nOf course, I'm sure your girlfriend won't like that, either.", "ESH. It's about effort and communication. If she wants you to put in more effort by learning this skill then you need to communicate whether you care enough to meet her halfway and do it.

Up to you both.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH just because I also am terrible at wrapping presents - like comically bad.

However I do also think your gf over-reacted", "ESH, but you more than her.\n\nHonestly, I don't see anything wrong with gift bags as long as there is some kind of effort with them. Like, just the gift bag by itself should be enough, and they can be reused. I think its pretty lame she was demanding wrapped gifts.\n\nHowever, as someone who used to never wrap gifts because \"I was bad at it\": How long does it take to pull up a tutorial video online? I found one, was about 3 minutes long, and followed along. Now I can wrap presents with wrapping paper and not have it look like a slop job.\n\nHanding someone a poorly wrapped has bad optics, especially if it's your SO and you know they love wrapped gifts. It makes it seem like you don't want to put in effort for the recipient.", "NTA. I hate things being chucked into a gift bag too - it\u2019s just a glorified carrier bag in that case. However, you wrapped them and that shows effort to me!", "YTA. If it's in boxes, it's try not that hard.im not great at it either but it's not rocket science.

Fairly thin (so it folds easily). Or just some semi-transparent glittery fabric. Preferably one that doesn\u2019t need hemming (ask the staff in the sewing shop). \n\nThen buy some nice ribbon & some coloured tissue paper. \n\nWhen you need to wrap a present, first wrap it with tissue paper (which is quite forgiving, so long as it\u2019s half-decently done). Then put it inside a square or circle of the fancy material, and gather that up, and tie with the ribbon. \n\nBonus points for getting some cute gift tags, and maybe some gift-wrapping bows. \n\nBecause if she\u2019s a nice person who just loves the effort & Effect of prettily wrapped presents, then the extra details of using gift tags will make a difference. \n\nNote that this option is also very environmentally friendly. The material & ribbon can be re-used many times over. Save the planet etc etc :-)\n\nAlternative option would be (again, only if she\u2019s lovely & kind & just likes nice present-wrapping - this isn\u2019t the approach I\u2019d take for someone who was generally demanding) - once Christmas is over, start buying her minor \u201cpresents\u201d every 2-3 weeks (I\u2019m talking a \u00a31 chocolate bar, or a 30p packet of sweets) and asking her to show you how to wrap them. Make it a cute date-night activity - NOT about you being \u201cbad\u201d and her \u201cimproving you\u201d - just you wanting to be open to doing something that makes her happy, and could be both a fun little half hour every few weeks, and also a cute story as the year goes on - and it\u2019s a very useful (if not massively life-changing) life skill. \n\nBut like I say, this is only a good option if you\u2019re both generally nice to each other.", "Nah, my husband isn\u2019t the best at wrapping presents and would far prefer just putting them in a bag, but he gives it a go because he knows I like unwrapping them.

I'm also wondering why he didn't just pay to get them gift wrapped by wherever he bought them from, or go to one of those places in the shopping centers that offer charitable/ donation- funded gift wrapping services. We have them all over in the US. \n\nI am one of those who finds gift wrapping so easy it's ridiculous, and quietly suspect anyone claiming it's hard of engaging in some level of performative incompetence, because it is literally first grade scissor skills + folding + taping.

Some people simply have different abilities. \n\nNTA", "You\u2019re probably just using too much paper.", "Weaponized incompetence can also mean \u201cdon\u2019t ask/expect me to do this task, because I\u2019m just going to do a bad job\u201d.", "Yeah, it's kind of a problem, I either cut it too big or way too small \ud83e\udd79 I have successfully only used one roll of wrapping paper this year for Christmas \ud83d\ude0e", "I'm terrible at wrapping presents, so I just started wrapping everything the way I did when I worked in supermarket deli. Put the gift in the corner of the paper (which is positioned like a diamond shape), fold corner of wrapping paper over gift, fold in the two side corners, keep kind of flipping it until you reach the end of the top corner, which you hold down with one piece of tape.", "That\u2019s a feat! My sister taught me how to wrap a book when I was a kid. She was a pro. \u201cIt\u2019s all about cutting the paper to the right size,\u201d she said.", "This is how they wrap things in Japan!", "I love it!", "Just take it to the damn mall and pay someone to do it. Both you and your GF sound exhausting but this is easily solvable.", "Wishing you a speedy treatment & recovery! Much appreciation for your service."]}
