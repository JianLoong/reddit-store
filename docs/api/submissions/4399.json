We live in a top floor flat in the south of England & have lived here for 3 & a half years. \n\nOur previous neighbours below me moved about 5/6 months ago & we now have new neighbours. They are a couple in their early-mid 20s I\u2019d say for the purpose of the story I\u2019ll call them John & Jane. We had seen them a few times in passing on the stairwell & they seemed nice enough. \n\nA month or so ago, Jane knocked on the door & asked if it\u2019s possible that we could keep the noise to a minimum as she works from home & can hear sounds in her living room & is trying to work. I told her I would do my best to accommodate her however I have a toddler that doesn\u2019t understand how to be quiet really & so that may not always be possible. She seemed okay with that answer & went back downstairs. \n\nI have begun to place thick blankets on the floor in the living room & her bedroom to hopefully mitigate the sounds & until recent I thought it was fine. \n\nWell recently my daughter has been sick with a chest infection & it\u2019s been a rough time while she gets better. Last week John came up & knocked on the door & began to complain about the noise again, I informed him that I\u2019ve been trying my best to keep the noise down while she\u2019s playing but there is only so much I can do. He then proceeds to tell me that that\u2019s not the issue but my daughter crying is. \n\nI told him that I\u2019m really sorry but she\u2019s been unwell & I can\u2019t stop her from crying when she\u2019s not feeling well. I explained that it\u2019s not something I can control & I\u2019m doing what I can because she\u2019s just not sleeping. He wasn\u2019t happy with the answer I gave him & started off on a tirade of really horrible things calling me all the names under the sun & saying that I must be a shitty parent if I can\u2019t comfort her enough for her to stop crying. \n\nI lost it & told him that I refuse to be spoken to that way & that I have been more than accommodating to him & Jane when it comes to my daughter playing & that I\u2019m sorry that I cannot control when my daughter cries. That I\u2019m doing the best I can & I wish I was also getting more rest. I then proceeded to call him a few more colourful names myself & slammed the door in his face. \n\nMy partner was at work so I called a friend of mine who said that although he agreed with me I shouldn\u2019t have slammed the door in his face & should have tried to be more respectful of him & that I should knock downstairs & apologise to him. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: a couple of people have asked so, yes my partner knows about what happened. I\u2019m not usually a confrontational person & tend to back down a lot (I\u2019m usually a little ball of anxiety) so he said that he\u2019s proud of me for standing up for myself. \n\nHe\u2019s quite angry about it. He asked me not to talk to either John or Jane because in his words \u2018they don\u2019t deserve to talk to you or our daughter\u2019. He wants to get police involved & was waiting on me to decide what I want to do. \n\nAlso, I will send an email over to the letting agent & block management to let them know what\u2019s going on. \n\nThank you to the people who wished my daughter well, we took her back to the doctor today & she has been given some anti-biotics to hopefully help clear the infection so her breathing should start to get better soon. She\u2019s currently cuddled up with me watching some bluey before I attempt to get her to eat some dinner.", "created_utc": 1670689308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhwj6u/aita_for_slamming_the_door_in_my_neighbours_face/", "score": 1473, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When you rent in a family friendly location, you have to expect to hear children playing and crying.", "NTA. They should move to a house if they don\u2019t want to hear their neighbours. Sounds like you\u2019ve tried to be respectful & accommodate. You can\u2019t help if your child is crying. He\u2019s definitely the AH.", "NTA, you try to be considerate of your neighbors but if your young child is crying what do they want you to do?? They have a lot of nerve coming up to yell at you about your child being sick. \n\nIf it\u2019s such an issue for them I think if anything they should talk to the landlord about noise proofing.", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" is an interesting person.  So your neighbor comes to your door, complains, goes off on a tirade of calling you horrible names and your friend thinks you need to apologize to the neighbor and should have been more respectful - wtf!  Tell your friend that respect is earned.", "I understand the frustration of hearing a kid crying since I'm not big on children at all. I've been in that neighbor's shoes. However, I would never dream to confront the neighbors about it at all. Obviously you already have enough going on without someone bitching about it too. That's in such poor taste. Let the landlord know about this and tell them that you expect no further harassment from those people. \n\nFirst thing I ask when moving into a bottom floor apartment is who lives above me, do they have kids, etc. They could have done the same thing. It's called due diligence. \n\nNTA but I would suggest another visit to the doc to make sure they've done everything they can for little one. Just in case it's gotten worse. Sounds like baby is super uncomfortable \ud83e\udd7a", "NTA but I think we all know who is. You tried to be a nice neighbor and took measures to mitigate which is more than reasonable. You may have over reacted a bit but who doesn't when they have a young baby....", "My first apartment I lived on the ground floor underneath a family with a toddler. Of course she made noise at times (She was a cute energetic little one). Sure a couple of the loud jumps would startle me at times, but that is just apartment living. I never actually interacted with them (single woman in grad school working 12 hr night shifts at the time so not home too much) but my parents came to visit me once and happened to pass by the family. They were apologetic about any noise and said they would do their best to keep her quiet. I was quite surprised but my parents understood having had the experience of having two young children at one time. People move into an apartment they have to realize it's not a detached unit and noise might occasionally happen. Also, you can do your very best with a young child but they are still growing and learning. Especially if they're sick, of course they are going to cry. People need to have more empathy. Or at least understand the reality of living in attached complexes. NTA.", "NTA. Babies cry. If they can't handle apartment living, they need to figure out other arrangements.", "NTA.  Period.  You\u2019ve been courteous.  They rented below you after your kid was here.  If there\u2019s a nuisance, they rented after its existence and their opportunity to know of it.  You went farther than needed.  They were rude, you responded appropriately.", "NTA\n\nThese people must\u2019ve forgotten that living below someone tends to create noise. You even went the extra mile to try to muffle the sound. These people sound ridiculous. Next time they come by just open the door and slam it back closed. \n\nGood luck", "NTA. Sometimes, we're provoked and react in ways that, upon reflection, were (in fact) called for. This was one time that it was. \n\nNow tell your landlord what happened before the downstairs tenants start complaining to them.", "Nta\n\nNoise is part of living in an apartment, if they want silence *they* need to look for different housing. You've been a accommodating as you can be.", "Your friend is super wrong here. \n\nNTA, the correct response was exactly what you did. If he wants to start going in on you then he better be ready to get it back at him.", "NTA\n\nI'm not sure how the law works in the UK (I'm assuming from your writing) but in the US the law states that children are expected to make noise and that as long as it is normal noise for a child (not bowling or playing a full drum kit for example, just walking, crying, running, playing) then there is nothing anyone can do and people acting like your neighbors are actively harassing you. Children are not expected to sit quietly and do nothing. They are children. There is some noise involved with their existence.\n\nI suggest looking into your local law, find out exactly what it is, and armed with that information go to your landlord about them harassing you. And don't answer the door to them anymore. \n\nI have raised two kids in an apartment and had to do exactly the same thing because my downstairs neighbors would get upset if we so much as dropped something on the floor. They got put on notice to leave me alone and I haven't had the problem since.", "NTA. Children make noise. You went out of your way to try and mitigate it, what more can you do? You should have slammed the door in his face the moment he started getting verbally abusive. If anyone should apologise, it's him.", "OP, you are NTA. Normally, I would say that violent actions like slamming doors are an inappropriate action taken when we don\u2019t know how to express ourselves in a more productive manner. But this\u2026individual\u2026disrespected you in your own home and insulted your parenting in a mindbogglingly ignorant manner. Slamming the door in his face was just an exclamation point on a proportionate rebuttal. You are under no obligation to apologize to someone who went out of his way to attack you.", "Shoulda slammed it twice", "Hell no. DO NOT APOLOGIZE. This man came to your house and yelled at you. You shut the door on him as you should have!\n\nLet them know they can add sound dampening materials to their side of the walls if it is that big of an issue. It sounds like you\u2019ve done everything that\u2019s reasonably expected. \n\nNTA", "So there was a post on here yesterday with the opposite POV regarding a newborn and parents who were out of their minds in dealing with constant crying. \n\nThe guy who posted was the person who went up to their neighbors and complained about the infant crying all day and it kept their sick mother up at all hours. He then proceeded to berate the mom because in his opinion she wasn\u2019t doing enough. The child wasn\u2019t well and only came home after 3 months in the hospital. \n\nHe was chewed out like you wouldn\u2019t believe. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Your child is sick and you\u2019re already trying to accommodate them. Noise from neighbors is annoying but people could do with a bit more empathy. I hope your child gets better soon!", "NTA. I would also say\u2026I wouldn\u2019t open the door to him when you are alone anymore. If a man is willing to start saying stuff like that to a woman alone with her toddler\u2026he can talk to my husband or no one.", "INFO: do you have carpeting or rugs on the floor?", "NTA. \nI think almost everyone that has cared for children before completely understands  it's impossible to keep full control of a kid's actions and reactions. Your daughter is sick and that must be uncomfortable for her, so her natural response is to cry, which is not your fault. Also a lot of children don't realize/care about how loud they are, after all, demanding attention is their goal. \n\nI wonder if they (neighbors) even took actions themselves to try to cancel the noise somehow, from what you explained, they seem entitled. Slamming the door on someone's face isn't polite, but it is a way do deal with these kind of people. You defended yourself (and your home) from your neighbor's hostility. \n\nIn short, neighbors need to learn you can't put children in silent mode.", "NTA. It sounds like you were trying to be accommodating to your neighbors by making efforts to reduce the noise in your apartment. Your daughter being sick and crying is not something you can control, and it is not fair for your neighbor to criticize you for it. Furthermore, his response was completely inappropriate and unacceptable, and you were justified in standing up for yourself and shutting the door in his face. You are not an asshole for doing so. It may be helpful to have a conversation with your partner about how to handle future interactions with your neighbors, but you are not in the wrong for reacting the way you did.", "If you have floor coverings, you have done all that you can do. Please don't engage further with this lunatic. Report this interaction to your landlord immediately. And if they continue to harass you? Consider further action such as an order of protection.  NTA", "Ouf, NTA.\n\nYour friend might also be the asshole though...", "NTA you should have slammed the door sooner and harder in my opinion, but I'm American, lol we're rude like that\ud83e\udd23", "NTA.\n\n\nAnyone that doesn\u2019t understand that kids make noise and cry is an arsehole.", "NTA.\n\nNot for slamming the door in his face after he started calling you names, even if you called him names back. Though it would have been better after the first insult: \"If you can't talk normally to me, we're done talking\" but whatever.\n\nAlso not for having an unwell child that cries. Children cry, and that is to be expected, especially in an apartment complex. Of course it can be annoying for others, but it's not like you're playing loud music at all times of the day and night.", "From somebody who can't stand the sound of children crying and who does not have kids: NTA! \n\nYour neighbour is being unreasonable. If you live in a flat that is not on the top floor, you will always hear what the people above you are doing. You've done your best to not disturb them but it's a fact of life that babies and toddles cry, especially when they're sick. This is not something that can be controlled. Your neighbours will have to get themselves some noise-cancelling headphones, or a house in the country or not work from home.\n\nYour neighbour verbally attacked you and your reaction was completely within acceptable limits.", "NTA, not for any of it.", "NTA, if they want such a quiet environment to work from home they should not be living in an apartment.", "NTA a trillion times over. My god. Why do these people live in an apartment if they are this sensitive to noise?", "NTA. He was unreasonable and rude, you tried being nice and when he doubled down on being an ass, you called him out for his unrealistic BS. He's obviously not qualified to parent if that's how he thinks babies and toddlers work lmfao. What a fkn clown", "NTA. Kids don't come with mute buttons. And shockingly enough being tiny humans they will take up space and make their presence known sometimes. And even more horrifying, when you try to explain to a baby that they are bothering the neighbors, they let it go in one ear and out the other. It's like they have no concept of the world around them yet or something.", "He is disrespectful to you yet your supposed to kiss his ass? That\u2019s ridiculous advice please don\u2019t take it", "NTA. \nReminder to self: do not knock on neighbours\u2019 doors if you ever hear their babies crying.", "NTA and it's obvious they don't have children. Let's hope they keep it that way\n\nHope she feels better soon OP so you both can get rest", "NTA - you have tried to minimize the noise as best you can and that is all you can do. A sick little one is going to cry, if he can't understand that it is on him, not you. Once he heard your explanation he decided to go further and insult you and that is unacceptable. He owes you an apology for that.", "If you can't stand noice around you don't move to a flat. NTA", "NTA...\n\nDon't loose your time and energy with this guy. You can't control your daughter crying and if she's ill or not (fast and complete recovery to your little angel btw).

Like you don't have to be polite if the guy in front of you of calling you names.\n\nIn your situation I would have said \"dude, if you're not smart enough to understand that a sick toddler is not a TV, I can't do anything for you *door slam shut*...\n\nBeing polite is a thing but standing your grounds is also important.", "NTA. You took measures to minimize the noise while your daughter was playing. Now your daughter has a chest infection and you\u2019re doing your best to take care of her while she\u2019s in pain and discomfort. I get why you slammed the door, and while I do understand why some people might say you shouldn\u2019t have slammed it, you also did not have to take that verbal abuse from your neighbor. Your neighbor did not have to be rude and unwilling to understand that your child is sick and you\u2019re doing your best.\n\nYou\u2019ve done your best to be accommodating but right now, your child is the priority.\n\n(Q: Does your partner know what your neighbor said to you?) \n\n(Had a chest infection recently, and it was awful. Can\u2019t imagine how it is for an 18-month baby. I could barely sleep or breathe and it really, really hurt.)", "NTA- as someone who\u2019s neighbour is in their terrible twos I know it\u2019s really annoying to hear screaming and crying but anyone with a working brain will realize that calming a child is harder than it seems and even harder when said child is sick", "NTA. If he comes up to apologize to you, you can consider apologizing to him as well. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on you to apologize though and if you do then he\u2019s going to expect that you do even more to quiet your child.", "You did as much as anyone could expect to help your neighbours - more, actually - and John was completely out of line. You\u2019re NTA at all, you were reacting to someone using threatening behaviour/language at your door. \n\nHearing neighbours constantly can be really horrible, but in these situations where the noise is just day-to-day, the only real solution is to approach the landlord about additional sound proofing. These two muppets missed a chance to get you on side and support them in any requests they might have made.", "We took her back to the doctor today & she\u2019s been given some anti-biotics to help her so hopefully some sleep will be in the cards soon.", "Haha, was it the neighbor from this story?", "That\u2019s what my partner has said to do too, luckily I have a peep hole so I\u2019ll be able to see who\u2019s knocking.", "Yes I have carpets", "That\u2019s a good point - anyone who feels it\u2019s acceptable to knock on a neighbours door (especially one with young children) and start ranting and swearing should be reported so there\u2019s a record of it.", "He does, I told him once he came home from work.  He\u2019s angry & said that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong", "I don\u2019t believe so, as far as I know it\u2019s just the two of them in the flat.\n\nETA that I haven\u2019t actually read that post so I can\u2019t say for sure.", "NTA. The downstairs neighbor needs to reach out to the landlord about better soundproofing or they need to move", "Agreed with your partner, and I\u2019m glad that he supports you in this. At the end of the day, it\u2019s you and your partner taking care of your child. \n\nMaybe your friend had good intentions and just wanted you to resolve conflict, but your friend isn\u2019t the one who has to deal with your neighbors all while taking care of a sick baby. \n\nIf anyone owes an apology in this situation, it\u2019s definitely your neighbors first and foremost.", "NTA.

That's on him, he can give it a go and see how well it works out for him?", "NTA- they knew the risk of living in a flat that was under someone else\u2019s flat. People have kids! They cry!

Do my neighbours complain when I've got my nieces and they are crying all the time when sick? Not a chance. Your neighbours are insensitive AH, who clearly have no idea how much sound is let through the floors of these flats no matter how much you try. \n\nI hear every sound from the top floor down to them walking around a room despite having another flat between us.

Some people need to buy their own private island.", "totally agree", "Our neighborhood has all of that, but we stayed in an airbnb recently (I know, I know), and it was the most deathly quiet suburban neighborhood I've ever been in. There were even kids playing outside when we pulled up. It was extremely off-putting.", "They'll try and eat it and then when you have to grab it and take it away they'll cry even more, lol", "Some people just want to be unhappy and complain. We once lived in the 2nd floor with 4 small kids. The oldest 2 went to school all day and I stayed home with the 2 year old and baby. The downstairs neighbors called the apartment manager constantly complaining about noise. At some point she started calling to complain regularly in the middle of Naptime. Boys are sleeping and I'm sitting on my couch or napping myself. Yet every other day the manager would call and say the neighbor complained. Manager always sided with the neighbor no matter how insane. How can we be noisy when everyone is asleep? I stopped being nice to my neighbor at that point. Just didn't open the door. They'd bang and bang and no one would answer.", "NTA.  Should have slammed the door.  The minute the inconsiderate prick.  Started calling you names.  Your next step should have been a formal complaint.  Call the landlord.  File a harassment complaint against your neighbor.  Let them know.  The next time your neighbor comes to your door.  And calls you those names.  You will be contacting the police.", "To the neighbors: Welcome to flat living, if you don\u2019t like it buy a house.", "Absolutely NTA in this situation whatsoever!! Good for you for standing up for yourself. I\u2019m from the south of England & have lived in a flat with a baby/toddler & understand your situation perfectly! You\u2019ve done all you can to try & be a good neighbour & you absolutely can\u2019t stop a child from crying when unwell. \nHis behaviour was appalling & you shouldn\u2019t stand for it. Can I ask, was your daughter with you when you answered the door? This makes it so much worse if she was.\nIf I were you, I would contact the police and get a paper trail started on harassment. Legally in the UK, harassment is defined as \u2018when a person behaves in a way which is intended to cause you distress or alarm\u2019. It also has to have happened on at least two occasions.\nI would speak to the police & let them know about the incident & that it left you in fear for yours & your child\u2019s safety. Even if they can\u2019t do anything this time, they may decide to give him an informal harassment warning, which will probably be enough for him to leave you alone. \n\nI would then do my best to ignore both the downstairs neighbours. If he bothers you again, do not engage, close the door & call the police immediately. Speak to your neighbour again & get a copy of the Ring footage.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to live in fear/worry in your own home & the little shit needs to know that his behaviour won\u2019t be tolerated. \n\nBest of luck to you, I really hope they move out soon!\n\nETA I hope your daughter feels better soon xx", "You should give somebody warning before you slam the door.  After that, it's their fault.  Lest someone get hit in the face accidentally.", "NTA.

Yes it sucks when you\u2019re broke or poor and that\u2019s all you can afford but that\u2019s life. That\u2019s how apartments work.\n\nMost parents try to keep their kids quiet because we don\u2019t exactly love the racket either. Most parents are going GD insane already if their baby or kid is crying, and they\u2019re trying their best to stop it unless they\u2019re doing \u2018cry it out\u2019 method of sleep training (where you\u2019re hoping you let them cry and then they won\u2019t in the future\u2026 I never did this though).\n\nPro life tip for everyone that if you ever wonder if a parent needs you to tell them their kid is being annoying and they should quiet it down\u2026.

They live in an apartment, they have to expect that there\u2019s going to be SOME noise, and it\u2019s not always going to be 100% in your control. The neighbor going on a freaking tirade absolutely deserved to have the door slammed in his face. I don\u2019t even have kids and I know this guy has unreasonable expectations, and it\u2019s weird that he somehow thinks you aren\u2019t aware of the noise. He needs noise canceling headphones, just like the mom of the OP in the post yesterday. It was kind of a similar situation, both babies are sick, they can\u2019t express how they\u2019re feeling any other way than crying, and sometimes no matter how hard you try, they\u2019re gonna cry. And clearly neither your neighbor nor the OP of the post yesterday even care to TRY to understand that.", "NTA at all\n\nThey live in an apartment.\n\nChildren are not subhuman. This is not a dog left to bark during the workday", "That age is hard on everyone! Toddler knows what they want but not how to always communicate that.

Letting your management and police know what's going on could have a paper trail that could help later on if they make more issues. I mean what do they expect really I think they might need to find a new place to live if they can't stand a little noise and neighbors. It's not like you're having big parties and cranking tons of music at all hours. \n\n I hope your daughter gets well soon; recently my little girl was sick really bad and it's hard. You can do as much as you can to try to comfort them but sicknesses and such make them more so miserable it's heartbreaking I feel you. Don't back down to those rude neighbors.", "NTA, because you just responded in kind. \n\nIt may not have been the best way to handle it though. You don not owe them an apology.", "You\u2019re not the asshole here, but \u2014 and I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t a popular opinion \u2014 I do still feel bad for John and Jane. No WAY should he have said those things to you, but it is really, really hard and stressful to not have any control over the noise level in your own home. He\u2019s absolutely TA for berating you, but behind that, I honestly feel for everyone involved.", "NTA. Your friend is also a jag; why is it okay for this strange man to stand at your door and berate you but not okay for you to fight back? Screw that. Slam the door in his face a million more times and tell him to suck clam while you\u2019re at it.", "NTA. I'd probably do the same if any of my neighbors came over and did that. My kid is also currently sick, the first few days was sleeping and waking up crying. It's hard helping sick toddlers. I hope your kiddo feels better soon!", "NTA! OP, I had the exact thing happen to me many years ago, I had a 3 year old living in a condo above a childless couple. They complained about us CONSTANTLY and one night my daughter had a stomach bug and of course I was taking care of her as well as cleaning up vomit and diarrhea and the husband came pounding on my door at 3 AM! \nIf you can't handle noise, don't live in a downstairs unit, period.", "Noise is a part of apartment living. If your neighbor wanted silence then he shouldn't have moved into an apartment complex. I live in an apartment complex and my nextdoor neighbor is going through chemotherapy. I can hear him vomiting and sobbing in pain while is wife consoles him throughout the day and night. You know what I don't do? Pound on their door and berate them for not being silent.\n\n\n\nI also help them out by grabbing groceries, walking their dog, taking their trash down to the dumpster, etc. Obviously you don't want your neighbors helping you out considering their behavior, but at the very least good neighbors don't get belligerent over something like a baby crying or a sick elderly man vomiting.\n\n\n\nYou are NTA.

It's like... the expectation is that the parent does everything.", "We have gotten the footage from the other neighbour & I\u2019ve put in a report online just to have the paper trail.

A crying child and people walking around is something you just have to deal with.", "Exactly.

Lol I don\u2019t have a problem with the noise around me because noice canceling headphones are a godsend, but I do worry that my mic will pick up loud ambient sounds that I can\u2019t control. My work is legal in nature and involves a lot of outward calls, so I need to sound professional.

You will still hear loud engines, lawn mowers, kids, dogs, sirens, etc. The Amtrak Silver Meteor train too as it goes by. Doesn't matter where you live; you're gonna have noise. Most WFH companies understand this. In fact, I was on the phone with one woman who, bless her heart, had her husband and an alarm specialist working on her home alarm system while she was working from home answering calls. She was mortified and so apologetic. I just chuckled and told her don't worry about it; life happens."]}
