We live in a top floor flat in the south of England & have lived here for 3 & a half years. \n\nOur previous neighbours below me moved about 5/6 months ago & we now have new neighbours. They are a couple in their early-mid 20s I\u2019d say for the purpose of the story I\u2019ll call them John & Jane. We had seen them a few times in passing on the stairwell & they seemed nice enough. \n\nA month or so ago, Jane knocked on the door & asked if it\u2019s possible that we could keep the noise to a minimum as she works from home & can hear sounds in her living room & is trying to work. I told her I would do my best to accommodate her however I have a toddler that doesn\u2019t understand how to be quiet really & so that may not always be possible. She seemed okay with that answer & went back downstairs. \n\nI have begun to place thick blankets on the floor in the living room & her bedroom to hopefully mitigate the sounds & until recent I thought it was fine. \n\nWell recently my daughter has been sick with a chest infection & it\u2019s been a rough time while she gets better. Last week John came up & knocked on the door & began to complain about the noise again, I informed him that I\u2019ve been trying my best to keep the noise down while she\u2019s playing but there is only so much I can do. He then proceeds to tell me that that\u2019s not the issue but my daughter crying is. \n\nI told him that I\u2019m really sorry but she\u2019s been unwell & I can\u2019t stop her from crying when she\u2019s not feeling well. I explained that it\u2019s not something I can control & I\u2019m doing what I can because she\u2019s just not sleeping. He wasn\u2019t happy with the answer I gave him & started off on a tirade of really horrible things calling me all the names under the sun & saying that I must be a shitty parent if I can\u2019t comfort her enough for her to stop crying. \n\nI lost it & told him that I refuse to be spoken to that way & that I have been more than accommodating to him & Jane when it comes to my daughter playing & that I\u2019m sorry that I cannot control when my daughter cries. That I\u2019m doing the best I can & I wish I was also getting more rest. I then proceeded to call him a few more colourful names myself & slammed the door in his face. \n\nMy partner was at work so I called a friend of mine who said that although he agreed with me I shouldn\u2019t have slammed the door in his face & should have tried to be more respectful of him & that I should knock downstairs & apologise to him. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: a couple of people have asked so, yes my partner knows about what happened. I\u2019m not usually a confrontational person & tend to back down a lot (I\u2019m usually a little ball of anxiety) so he said that he\u2019s proud of me for standing up for myself. \n\nHe\u2019s quite angry about it. He asked me not to talk to either John or Jane because in his words \u2018they don\u2019t deserve to talk to you or our daughter\u2019. He wants to get police involved & was waiting on me to decide what I want to do. \n\nAlso, I will send an email over to the letting agent & block management to let them know what\u2019s going on. \n\nThank you to the people who wished my daughter well, we took her back to the doctor today & she has been given some anti-biotics to hopefully help clear the infection so her breathing should start to get better soon. She\u2019s currently cuddled up with me watching some bluey before I attempt to get her to eat some dinner.\n\nEdit 2: I made the report to the police via their online chat & they will be calling me to make a statement & send over the video footage that another neighbour got on their door cam. I am only reporting it so that there is a record of what happened to make sure there is a paper trail incase either John or Jane retaliate towards me & my daughter or do this to someone else in the building. \n\nI have also emailed the block management & the letting agent just to inform them of what is happening.", "created_utc": 1670689308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhwj6u/aita_for_slamming_the_door_in_my_neighbours_face/", "score": 2747, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When you rent in a family friendly location, you have to expect to hear children playing and crying.", "NTA. They should move to a house if they don\u2019t want to hear their neighbours. Sounds like you\u2019ve tried to be respectful & accommodate. You can\u2019t help if your child is crying. He\u2019s definitely the AH.", "NTA, you try to be considerate of your neighbors but if your young child is crying what do they want you to do?? They have a lot of nerve coming up to yell at you about your child being sick. \n\nIf it\u2019s such an issue for them I think if anything they should talk to the landlord about noise proofing.", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" is an interesting person.  So your neighbor comes to your door, complains, goes off on a tirade of calling you horrible names and your friend thinks you need to apologize to the neighbor and should have been more respectful - wtf!  Tell your friend that respect is earned.", "I understand the frustration of hearing a kid crying since I'm not big on children at all. I've been in that neighbor's shoes. However, I would never dream to confront the neighbors about it at all. Obviously you already have enough going on without someone bitching about it too. That's in such poor taste. Let the landlord know about this and tell them that you expect no further harassment from those people. \n\nFirst thing I ask when moving into a bottom floor apartment is who lives above me, do they have kids, etc. They could have done the same thing. It's called due diligence. \n\nNTA but I would suggest another visit to the doc to make sure they've done everything they can for little one. Just in case it's gotten worse. Sounds like baby is super uncomfortable \ud83e\udd7a", "NTA but I think we all know who is. You tried to be a nice neighbor and took measures to mitigate which is more than reasonable. You may have over reacted a bit but who doesn't when they have a young baby....", "My first apartment I lived on the ground floor underneath a family with a toddler. Of course she made noise at times (She was a cute energetic little one). Sure a couple of the loud jumps would startle me at times, but that is just apartment living. I never actually interacted with them (single woman in grad school working 12 hr night shifts at the time so not home too much) but my parents came to visit me once and happened to pass by the family. They were apologetic about any noise and said they would do their best to keep her quiet. I was quite surprised but my parents understood having had the experience of having two young children at one time. People move into an apartment they have to realize it's not a detached unit and noise might occasionally happen. Also, you can do your very best with a young child but they are still growing and learning. Especially if they're sick, of course they are going to cry. People need to have more empathy. Or at least understand the reality of living in attached complexes. NTA.", "NTA. Babies cry. If they can't handle apartment living, they need to figure out other arrangements.", "NTA.  Period.  You\u2019ve been courteous.  They rented below you after your kid was here.  If there\u2019s a nuisance, they rented after its existence and their opportunity to know of it.  You went farther than needed.  They were rude, you responded appropriately.", "NTA\n\nThese people must\u2019ve forgotten that living below someone tends to create noise. You even went the extra mile to try to muffle the sound. These people sound ridiculous. Next time they come by just open the door and slam it back closed. \n\nGood luck", "NTA. Sometimes, we're provoked and react in ways that, upon reflection, were (in fact) called for. This was one time that it was. \n\nNow tell your landlord what happened before the downstairs tenants start complaining to them.", "Nta\n\nNoise is part of living in an apartment, if they want silence *they* need to look for different housing. You've been a accommodating as you can be.", "Your friend is super wrong here. \n\nNTA, the correct response was exactly what you did. If he wants to start going in on you then he better be ready to get it back at him.", "NTA\n\nI'm not sure how the law works in the UK (I'm assuming from your writing) but in the US the law states that children are expected to make noise and that as long as it is normal noise for a child (not bowling or playing a full drum kit for example, just walking, crying, running, playing) then there is nothing anyone can do and people acting like your neighbors are actively harassing you. Children are not expected to sit quietly and do nothing. They are children. There is some noise involved with their existence.\n\nI suggest looking into your local law, find out exactly what it is, and armed with that information go to your landlord about them harassing you. And don't answer the door to them anymore. \n\nI have raised two kids in an apartment and had to do exactly the same thing because my downstairs neighbors would get upset if we so much as dropped something on the floor. They got put on notice to leave me alone and I haven't had the problem since.", "NTA. Children make noise. You went out of your way to try and mitigate it, what more can you do? You should have slammed the door in his face the moment he started getting verbally abusive. If anyone should apologise, it's him.", "OP, you are NTA. Normally, I would say that violent actions like slamming doors are an inappropriate action taken when we don\u2019t know how to express ourselves in a more productive manner. But this\u2026individual\u2026disrespected you in your own home and insulted your parenting in a mindbogglingly ignorant manner. Slamming the door in his face was just an exclamation point on a proportionate rebuttal. You are under no obligation to apologize to someone who went out of his way to attack you.", "Shoulda slammed it twice", "Hell no. DO NOT APOLOGIZE. This man came to your house and yelled at you. You shut the door on him as you should have!\n\nLet them know they can add sound dampening materials to their side of the walls if it is that big of an issue. It sounds like you\u2019ve done everything that\u2019s reasonably expected. \n\nNTA", "So there was a post on here yesterday with the opposite POV regarding a newborn and parents who were out of their minds in dealing with constant crying. \n\nThe guy who posted was the person who went up to their neighbors and complained about the infant crying all day and it kept their sick mother up at all hours. He then proceeded to berate the mom because in his opinion she wasn\u2019t doing enough. The child wasn\u2019t well and only came home after 3 months in the hospital. \n\nHe was chewed out like you wouldn\u2019t believe. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Your child is sick and you\u2019re already trying to accommodate them. Noise from neighbors is annoying but people could do with a bit more empathy. I hope your child gets better soon!", "NTA. I would also say\u2026I wouldn\u2019t open the door to him when you are alone anymore. If a man is willing to start saying stuff like that to a woman alone with her toddler\u2026he can talk to my husband or no one.", "INFO: do you have carpeting or rugs on the floor?", "NTA. \nI think almost everyone that has cared for children before completely understands  it's impossible to keep full control of a kid's actions and reactions. Your daughter is sick and that must be uncomfortable for her, so her natural response is to cry, which is not your fault. Also a lot of children don't realize/care about how loud they are, after all, demanding attention is their goal. \n\nI wonder if they (neighbors) even took actions themselves to try to cancel the noise somehow, from what you explained, they seem entitled. Slamming the door on someone's face isn't polite, but it is a way do deal with these kind of people. You defended yourself (and your home) from your neighbor's hostility. \n\nIn short, neighbors need to learn you can't put children in silent mode.", "NTA. It sounds like you were trying to be accommodating to your neighbors by making efforts to reduce the noise in your apartment. Your daughter being sick and crying is not something you can control, and it is not fair for your neighbor to criticize you for it. Furthermore, his response was completely inappropriate and unacceptable, and you were justified in standing up for yourself and shutting the door in his face. You are not an asshole for doing so. It may be helpful to have a conversation with your partner about how to handle future interactions with your neighbors, but you are not in the wrong for reacting the way you did.", "If you have floor coverings, you have done all that you can do. Please don't engage further with this lunatic. Report this interaction to your landlord immediately. And if they continue to harass you? Consider further action such as an order of protection.  NTA", "Ouf, NTA.\n\nYour friend might also be the asshole though...", "NTA you should have slammed the door sooner and harder in my opinion, but I'm American, lol we're rude like that\ud83e\udd23", "NTA.\n\n\nAnyone that doesn\u2019t understand that kids make noise and cry is an arsehole.", "NTA.\n\nNot for slamming the door in his face after he started calling you names, even if you called him names back. Though it would have been better after the first insult: \"If you can't talk normally to me, we're done talking\" but whatever.\n\nAlso not for having an unwell child that cries. Children cry, and that is to be expected, especially in an apartment complex. Of course it can be annoying for others, but it's not like you're playing loud music at all times of the day and night.", "From somebody who can't stand the sound of children crying and who does not have kids: NTA! \n\nYour neighbour is being unreasonable. If you live in a flat that is not on the top floor, you will always hear what the people above you are doing. You've done your best to not disturb them but it's a fact of life that babies and toddles cry, especially when they're sick. This is not something that can be controlled. Your neighbours will have to get themselves some noise-cancelling headphones, or a house in the country or not work from home.\n\nYour neighbour verbally attacked you and your reaction was completely within acceptable limits.", "NTA, not for any of it.", "NTA, if they want such a quiet environment to work from home they should not be living in an apartment.", "NTA a trillion times over. My god. Why do these people live in an apartment if they are this sensitive to noise?", "NTA. He was unreasonable and rude, you tried being nice and when he doubled down on being an ass, you called him out for his unrealistic BS. He's obviously not qualified to parent if that's how he thinks babies and toddlers work lmfao. What a fkn clown", "NTA. Kids don't come with mute buttons. And shockingly enough being tiny humans they will take up space and make their presence known sometimes. And even more horrifying, when you try to explain to a baby that they are bothering the neighbors, they let it go in one ear and out the other. It's like they have no concept of the world around them yet or something.", "He is disrespectful to you yet your supposed to kiss his ass? That\u2019s ridiculous advice please don\u2019t take it", "NTA. \nReminder to self: do not knock on neighbours\u2019 doors if you ever hear their babies crying.", "NTA and it's obvious they don't have children. Let's hope they keep it that way\n\nHope she feels better soon OP so you both can get rest", "NTA - you have tried to minimize the noise as best you can and that is all you can do. A sick little one is going to cry, if he can't understand that it is on him, not you. Once he heard your explanation he decided to go further and insult you and that is unacceptable. He owes you an apology for that.", "If you can't stand noice around you don't move to a flat. NTA", "NTA...\n\nDon't loose your time and energy with this guy. You can't control your daughter crying and if she's ill or not (fast and complete recovery to your little angel btw).

Like you don't have to be polite if the guy in front of you of calling you names.\n\nIn your situation I would have said \"dude, if you're not smart enough to understand that a sick toddler is not a TV, I can't do anything for you *door slam shut*...\n\nBeing polite is a thing but standing your grounds is also important.", "NTA. You took measures to minimize the noise while your daughter was playing. Now your daughter has a chest infection and you\u2019re doing your best to take care of her while she\u2019s in pain and discomfort. I get why you slammed the door, and while I do understand why some people might say you shouldn\u2019t have slammed it, you also did not have to take that verbal abuse from your neighbor. Your neighbor did not have to be rude and unwilling to understand that your child is sick and you\u2019re doing your best.\n\nYou\u2019ve done your best to be accommodating but right now, your child is the priority.\n\n(Q: Does your partner know what your neighbor said to you?) \n\n(Had a chest infection recently, and it was awful.

I could barely sleep or breathe and it really, really hurt.)", "NTA- as someone who\u2019s neighbour is in their terrible twos I know it\u2019s really annoying to hear screaming and crying but anyone with a working brain will realize that calming a child is harder than it seems and even harder when said child is sick", "NTA. If he comes up to apologize to you, you can consider apologizing to him as well. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on you to apologize though and if you do then he\u2019s going to expect that you do even more to quiet your child.", "You did as much as anyone could expect to help your neighbours - more, actually - and John was completely out of line. You\u2019re NTA at all, you were reacting to someone using threatening behaviour/language at your door. \n\nHearing neighbours constantly can be really horrible, but in these situations where the noise is just day-to-day, the only real solution is to approach the landlord about additional sound proofing. These two muppets missed a chance to get you on side and support them in any requests they might have made.", "We took her back to the doctor today & she\u2019s been given some anti-biotics to help her so hopefully some sleep will be in the cards soon.", "Haha, was it the neighbor from this story?", "That\u2019s what my partner has said to do too, luckily I have a peep hole so I\u2019ll be able to see who\u2019s knocking.", "Yes I have carpets", "That\u2019s a good point - anyone who feels it\u2019s acceptable to knock on a neighbours door (especially one with young children) and start ranting and swearing should be reported so there\u2019s a record of it.", "He does, I told him once he came home from work.  He\u2019s angry & said that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong", "I don\u2019t believe so, as far as I know it\u2019s just the two of them in the flat.\n\nETA that I haven\u2019t actually read that post so I can\u2019t say for sure.", "NTA.

I know it isn't always possible but that should show you that things will be out of your control.\n\nI say all this as someone who lives below a family with small kids. Their apartment has tile floors, which means there is no sound-deafening. I hear everything. The running, the thumping, the sound of what sounds like a cannonball dropping. When the kids aren't in school, I hear them. And I hear them late at night. At that point, it's probably the parents that I hear, but either way, my peace is disturbed at all hours. I admit that I don't like those people at all. Eventually, I will mention the noise level to the management team since I'm not confrontational and can't bring myself to talk to the people upstairs directly. I remind myself that a certain amount of noise is to be expected and that I need to try to ignore them.

I was in my upstairs office, and the shots clearly came from that side of the house. So I went as many walls away from the shots into a room with as few windows as I could go. Gunshots are not exactly a regular occurrence in my current neighborhood, but I've been around enough to know that's how to handle them (put as many walls and as few windows as you can between you and the source).", "Shure makes great microphones, that are great for picking up only the sound you want. You have to tweak your audio input settings a bit, but they are excellent.", "While the persons mic below your comment may not pick up some noise or whether that sound just wasnt able to quite trigger the activation threshold, does not mean random background noise wont come through yours. People are also much less likely to notice their noise coming through their mic unless someone complains about it. If its not THAT bad? People might just ignore it completely until it gets jarring.\n\nSome software like discord has voice activation levels that are only triggered by certain levels, software and driver noise suppression, etc. I can hear some of my friends youtube videos or games vibrate through their headphones and into their mics. \n\nSome mics are very sensitive and some aren't, people on open mic can be aggravating. Discord comes with krisp which works decently. The ultimate ive found is RTX VOICE which I believe requires a nvidia card (same for nvidia broadcast) Its much better than the new nvidia broadcast.

You could also look into setting up push to talk or disabling any sort of automatic voice activation scaling and set it to a threshold where it only triggers while speaking and not while moving around or hitting keys, etc.\n\nIf whatever software you use allows microphone testing, then you can see how noticeable background noises are there, mashing your keyboard, someone banging pans, etc.", "I\u2019m noise sensitive also as well as sensitive to music when im doing school work.
