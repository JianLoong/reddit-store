I asked my other son to show me other clips and all of them were really similar.\n\nI ended up going to my 17yr old and asked him what all that was about. He just kept shrugging so I told him I\u2019d like his skateboard. He immediately began to protest and latched onto it. I tried explaining that I\u2019d give it back after he stopped being so reckless or at least till his arm healed but he told me that I\u2019m being overdramatic, that he\u2019s going to be an adult next year and that I\u2019m being really unfair.

Unless your SIL wants to pay for his next visit to the ER, she can shut the hell up.", "NTA. Considering there are a bunch of videos being taken, and it's ending up on his Instagram, then it sounds like he's doing those stunts and being reckless to try and gain attention online, which really isn't helpful. You're not being spiteful, you're worried about his physical safety, and he needs to learn that his health is always much more important than likes online.", "I see your point. And I see your son's point too. Are there rules in general about what he's allowed to do when he's boarding? Maybe start with some rules about degrees of difficulty, particularly with a cast on his arm? I would not punish him for getting hurt in the first place, though> I'd just tell him that he has to demonstrate some reasonable maturity before he does himself a greater harm.\n\nWanting him to not bust his head open isn't bad parenting though. NTA for that.", "NAH \n\nI can see both sides. But as his parent, you have every right to take the skateboard away. He\u2019s correct in that he\u2019ll be an adult soon, but until then, you\u2019re responsible for him and his choices.

I get it that trying new things on a skateboard can lead to broken bones .

I guess you can't do anything about it then let them do their own mistakes .\n\nI saw posts with really uptight parents you are  a worried parten who doesn't want her son get seriously hurt .

But skateboarding has always been dangerous and you've allowed him to do it before... so he's going to see this as unfair punishment for being clumsy.

Even if he doesn't wind up with a serious injury he's storing up a lot of pain for his later years. I wonder if he's trying to emulate things he's seen on Tiktok or create his own exciting content? Either way he sounds like he's being quite juvenile and irresponsible with it. You don't mention if you're in the US but if so then medical bills will be a factor. \n\nYou're also going to get a lot of flak from people on here for this, mainly because they're likely to be people with no experience of parenthood and limited understanding of adulthood.", "Honestly OP nobody sucks here, I can understand why you\u2019re taking the skateboard because you\u2019re afraid of him getting hurt or being sent to the ER, you\u2019re a parent and you want to keep your son safe, it\u2019s a parent thing, but at the same time your son is 17 and he has the right to make stupid decisions, what you could do here in this situation OP is give him back the skateboard, but tell him that he should be very safe when using it, such as wearing a helmet, as well as elbow pads and kneepads, even the best skateboarder in the world like Tony Hawk wear protective gear, when doing their tricks, and tell him just to be more careful such as don\u2019t do any tricks, you don\u2019t think you can do, and think about your limitations.", "I have a skater at home who is currently 16 years old. He has had a broken arm, and also broke his elbow severe enough that he has had three surgeries, and a busted chin in last few years. There is no way he would be allowed that skateboard or to even scooter just down the street why he was healing. Luckily, this was never an issue. My teen didn't want another three week stay in children's hospital so he respected what the doctors ordered and didn't skate for 6 months while he was healing.

The benefits of allowing bones and skin time to heal.\nAre you supportive of his hobby? \n\nLastly, taking away his board won't keep him from skateboarding, I would wager his friends have boards he could hop on.", "NTA. from a medical perspective, you would be a negligent parent if you let him skateboard while his arm is broken. at the same time, it isn\u2019t normal for a 17 year old to not be exercising any logic. maybe something else is going on in his life that you are unaware of.", "NTA", "NTA- You're a parent, not his friend.

As long as he is wearing a helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, mouth gaurd, etc. then you need to let it go.", "NTA. I was conflicted at first but hearing he is still \"doing\" crazy tricks with a broken arm is just downright stupid.

He's not an adult yet and you're not taking it to crush his dreams or whatever.

His new reckless behavior could be a form of self harm.", "NTA, but you need to get your son some help. He\u2019s intentionally doing dangerous tricks on his skateboard even though he knows he could get hurt even further, and he also \u201ccrashed your car for fun\u201d?

Taking the skateboard isn't a long-term solution, but it may be a way to start the process of reaching one.\n\nYou need to try and get to the root of this.  You say he's posting these videos to Instagram; it may be attention-seeking.  Unfortunately, the core of social media is a \"stranger approval\" system that, pretty actively, conditions users to hinge their self-esteem on others' opinions.  If you're not mature enough to handle it, it can be *devastating* to someone's mental health.\n\nObviously, I don't know your kid, personally.  However, this is a well-documented (and relatively common) occurrence.\n\nThe reaction is just normal kid stuff, though.  Of course, he's not going to like being told what he's doing is wrong or having a consequence placed on him.  However, his choices have made those necessary.  You're not an asshole, for that.", "NTA - his complete disregard for his own safety is super concerning. You'd be an AH for seeing his recklessness and not doing anything, imo.", "NTA.  I'm a mom of a 16 year old, I get it, we want them to use just a little common sense, like not riding skateboards after just breaking their arm on said skateboard.  Sadly, taking the skateboard away won't stop him from borrowing someone else's but hopefully slow him down for a day or two.", "NTA. Your is clearly having some kind of issue, though. The sudden recklessness, and not just recklessness, but extremely dumb and reckless, and he wrecked a car for fun! Your son needs to see a professional ASAP.", "Yeah he crashed your car and doing these wreckers skateboarding stunts for views. Your son isn't \n\n>VERY responsible and mature\n\nSo NTA.", "The fact that his brother was worried enough to tell on him says a lot. I don't know if it was the older or younger bro but normally siblings a certain age don't tell on each other. \n\nOf course you are NTA \n\nBut something is going on with your son. Behaviour changes of that extreme normally don't happen just like that. \nYou sound like you truly worry for him, do I hope you will soon find the root of the problem. \n\n***\nSh*t this reminds me of another story here. A mom posted that her 15-year old son who has always been responsible babysat his much younger twin sisters. He refused to get them food and had them eat peanutbutter although he knew they were slightly allergic of it. They threw up, and he was super dismissive of it \nParents were shocked and angry, but tried to find the root of the problem. Found out the boy had been sexually assaulted which is why his behaviour changed \ud83d\ude14", "I mean NTA but there\u2019s something else going on that you need to figure out.", "Read above he crashed her car purposely.\nWhy is she even writing about a skateboarding", "Everyone is completely ignoring my issue. I would not take the skateboard or even be bothered about his hobbies if he wasn\u2019t skating with a broken arm. I literally didn\u2019t take it when he broke his arm, only after I found out he\u2019s been skating while his arm is still broken (and while he\u2019s grounded).", "Look. I don\u2019t care if he does stupid things. I did stupid things as a teen too. It\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s doing these things with a broken arm and possibly even more injuries.", "The hospital bill should give him perspective.", "Because I\u2019m not conflicted about anything I did in regards to that.

Way to bury the lede", "He\u2019s reckless bc he is a teenager on a skateboard. I totally get where your concerns come from but he\u2019s the one getting hurt. I dont think taking away a hobby that he is obviously invested in would help the situation. He will probably resent you. Im not judging you, im trying you to not make a bigger deal that this actually is.", "That doesn\u2019t make your actions any less effective, in all likelihood.  Please notice I never gave a judgement, as I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH, but there are better ways.  Take some time from work.  Go some where just the two of you that he\u2019d like.  Wait a little while, have a good time separate of all this, THEN softly ask him about what is going on lately without even mentioning a skateboard.  If you just take from him something he can get elsewhere with ease, he may even try to one up previous stuff as an Eff You moment.  Would you prefer he do that?", "If they live in the US.", "Respectfully It\u2019s about your son wanting to HURT himself not about skateboarding or what punishment fits. If  car crash was \u2018handled\u2019 he wouldn\u2019t still be hurting himself.", "I said he\u2019s usually responsible and mature. The car crash just adds to my point of how he\u2019s starting to completely disregard his personal safety.", "Because I know I\u2019m not the asshole for how I responded to it? I\u2019m only asking about the skateboard and I\u2019m only asking because the SIL I never talk to especially ever since my husband passed away randomly contacted me out of the blue to tell me that I am a massive AH for taking away his board.", "Right, because taking away a skateboard until his arm is healed is going to destroy their relationship and he\u2019ll go no contact as soon as he moves out for all the abuse he\u2019s been suffering. Honestly taking the skateboard was so neglectful.\n\nI really hope no one takes that seriously I\u2019m being sarcastic LMAO. He\u2019s an ah teenager making reckless decisions, if mom took it and saw the videos I would assume that it\u2019s his only one he has access to from home. Buddy is also grounded for joy riding in his moms car. Mom is NTA.", "Look if you think I\u2019m an asshole for taking the board, I understand. Even I can admit now that it really won\u2019t lead me anywhere. I accept that I was wrong. But it is a big deal. He does not care about his safety.", "I\u2019m sorry if I sounded defensive. I just feel like people aren\u2019t getting my concern. Thank you for the advice :)", "I\u2019m dealing with the car crash and this is why I didn\u2019t want to include it in my post. I just wanted to know if taking the skateboard was not a good course of action and I got my answer.", "Wait .  Crashing a car intentionally is A LOT DIFFERENT than getting injuries practicing skateboarding.  Your son does not need to be \u201cpunished\u201d  he needs emergency mental emotional therapy as he is harming himself . You need to understand where this is coming from before reacting to it .", "Does he now have new friends he is trying to show off for?

If he thinks he is almost grown let him get a job and learn just how far money actually goes", "Bro way to bury the lede!!! The issue here is the overall pattern of recklessness, and taking away the skateboard is a good move. I think you need to have a sit down talk with your son and figure out what is going on with him and what has changed recently.", "This is a far bigger issue than the skateboarding\u2026", "Do you think he could be somewhat depressed? A sudden disregard for personal safety with no previous track record of recklessness is very alarming.", "Uhhh when did your husband pass away? The sudden acting out could definitely be a grief response, your kid might benefit from talking to a therapist.", "> ever since my husband passed away\n\nYou keep providing relevant additional information randomly in dribs and drabs throughout the comments. You're definitely an AH for that. If that's the way you communicate with your son it could also be a factor.", "No problem. I was worried it came off twatty so I am glad it didnt. I really hope you guys find a solution and every stays safe. I would love an update if you find time. Fingers crossed its a good one. :)", "I didn\u2019t say you are an arshole.

Thats why we do crazy things when we are young.", "Or he might grow up and realize of how much danger he was in with his recklesness. At the moment it is just a broken arm, next time he hits his head because he can't save himself (remember broken arm) and becomes an imbecile. And guess who has to take care of him then?   \n\n\nI am all for personal  responsiblity but if a kid or even a teenager fails at that front parents need to step in and teach them. And he is not only endangering himself. He crashed HER car for the thrill of it. Something has to have happen because that is just madness.", "What people are trying to say is that these incidents are CLEARLY related.  Your son is exhibiting reckless thrill and attention-seeking behaviour, and the car crash provides much needed context for the skateboarding incidents.  This may also be related to the death of your husband.  Grounding him and taking away his skateboard until he has healed is honestly not going far enough.  While grounding is a good first step you need to address the root cause of what\u2019s happening or it won\u2019t stop.", "Nope, same friends since elementary school and he\u2019s been dating his girlfriend since he was 15 so he\u2019s not trying to impress her either. I might ask him to do that, but at a later time after I figure out wtf is going on. My brother helped me with the car repairs thankfully.", "Yeah and I know I\u2019m not the asshole for grounding him etc for that therefore I\u2019m not asking. I\u2019m asking about taking his skateboard specifically and after reading these comments and thinking about it, I\u2019ve realized that it wasn\u2019t the best course of action and that it will essentially lead me nowhere.", "It\u2019s not about the Iranian yogurt\ud83d\ude02", "I don\u2019t have kids, but nobody crashes a car for fun. Your kid had a blatant disregard for his life. Are you sure he\u2019s not depressed or suicidal or something?", "If he doesn\u2019t want to stop, he has to face the consequences. Either mom takes his board away and he\u2019s grounded, or he pays for his self inflicted injuries. \n\nIf he thinks he\u2019s so cool and hardcore, like you seem to think you are, then he can grow up and pay for the consequences of being cool and hardcore.", "You're NTA for taking his board away. You are however TA for not getting him help since he seems to be reacting to his fathers death. Get this kid to counseling and make sure his brain is okay ffs.", "TW: talk of self harm and suicidal ideation/behaviors\n\nOkay so after reading all the comments. YTA. Because your son is going through a serious emotional crisis and you\u2019re acting like he isn\u2019t. He needs therapy and I worry is self harming through this and could maybe be suicidal. You left out many key details only to drop them randomly. \n\nHe intentionally crashed your car \u201cfor fun\u201d\u2026. Sounds much more like an unalive attempt. \n\nHe\u2019s acted out \u201csince your husband died\u201d\u2026. He lost his father and you didn\u2019t mention that?! \n\nSo YTA because you took the board but aren\u2019t getting your son help that he NEEDS and focusing on an item. Get your son help.", "I\u2019m not going to give a judgement. I do truly think you\u2019re focusing on the wrong things though. No one in their right mind crashes a car \u201cfor fun\u201d\u2026 you said you\u2019re dealing with it, but unless that\u2019s a serious mental health evaluation and therapy I don\u2019t think you\u2019re taking the right approach. \n\nNow he\u2019s continuing to take risks just with his skateboard. Is it possible he\u2019s trying to get the endorphins of s3lf h*rm in a creative manner? Also since he\u2019s posting the videos it sounds like he\u2019s seeking external validation and popularity/support. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for taking the skateboard that\u2019s a very linear knee jerk reaction to the situation you make dumb decision using the skateboard (a), which causes you to get hurt (b); therefore if I take away the skateboard you can\u2019t use it to get hurt (c). However, I don\u2019t think that\u2019d the root of your problem.", "NTA. It's a proper punishment, and tbf your son will likely continue to skateboard while his arm is supposed to be healing. Also your SIL clearly hasn't seen the many clips of him getting injured. \n\nI used to work as a bike instructor and one of the most important pieces of equipment anyone can wear for a bike, skateboard, etc. is a helmet. Please ensure that he wears a helmet, cause it can go as far as cracking his skull open if he's not careful. You might just be wondering if you're TAH just for taking the skateboard away, but you had good reason to. He's being reckless and will continue to get himself hurt.", "ESH.  You stated, \"....son is usually VERY responsible and mature for his age,\" but he also wrecked you car for fun, so you are wrong.  People with common sense do not wreck other people's cars for fun.  If he has not learned responsibility by now, he isn't going to at 17 and he will just borrow someone else's board.  You get some of the blame due to the fact that you could type very responsible and wrecked car for fun in the same post.  That is a pattern and I am betting there are more examples.  Getting injured on a skateboard is normal for that age.  He is old enough so that he is going to have to learn the hard way and you aren't gong to be able to stop him from succeeding at it.  If you let him drive your car, I'd up your insurance coverage to at least $300k/$500k to protect yourself from his \"VERY responsible\" nature.", "YTA for the skateboard but especially for not bothering to find out what's going on with your almost adult son. A few more months and he's an adult you can't take things away from any more, how do you plan to control his behavior then?", "NTA - and I mean I think there's a fairly decent chance his behavior can be chalked up to the fact that teenagers appear as adults, but their brain development is NOT on par with a mid-late 20's adult. They truly don't have the capacity to fully understand and assess risk. They underestimate risk and overestimate their abilities. \n\nBuuuuuuutttt, I also wonder if perhaps this goes a bit deeper. Its extremely common for athletes to struggle when they are injured. Participating in their sport of choice typically brings them a great deal of happiness. When that's taken away, even due to injury, it can be really, really hard for them. And sometimes its hard for others (like parents) to really see how devastating it is for them. \n\nAll of that to say - if you haven't, now might be a good time to tell your son you're sorry that he's hurt. You know how much he loves skateboarding, and you acknowledge that it must be really freaking hard not to be able to do that because of his injury. And then just leave it at that. You can have conversations at a later time about how important it is to allow injuries to heal fully, etc. But for a little bit, just validate that getting hurt sucks and having something that brings you joy be unavailable to you really sucks.", "YTA. Not for taking the skateboard, but ignoring the \u201che needs help\u201d signs.", "Or care for him if he cracks his head and becomes permanently disabled.

I'm assuming recently.\n\n-your son previously crashed your car for fun\n\nAdd that to doing things that actively lead to hurting himself with his skateboard. Do you understand the concept of self harm? Because it's not just about cutting wrists. At all. \n\nYour son is doing very reckless and very dangerous things that could end with him (and maybe others) severely hurt or even dead. This could be self harm or even suicidal tendencies. Have you taken your kid to therapy after your husband's death? Or after crashing a car on purpose? If not, why? What are you waiting for exactly? For him to hurt someone else?
