Skateboarding with broken limbs is a terrible idea. You need both arms during a fall to ensure you don't hit your head.

It's where they feel invincible and believe those bad things will only happen to other people and they're fine to engage in dangerous behavior. It's ended very badly for some people I know.", "NTA. Unless your SIL wants to pay for his next visit to the ER, she can shut the hell up.", "NTA. Considering there are a bunch of videos being taken, and it's ending up on his Instagram, then it sounds like he's doing those stunts and being reckless to try and gain attention online, which really isn't helpful. You're not being spiteful, you're worried about his physical safety, and he needs to learn that his health is always much more important than likes online.", "I see your point. And I see your son's point too. Are there rules in general about what he's allowed to do when he's boarding? Maybe start with some rules about degrees of difficulty, particularly with a cast on his arm? I would not punish him for getting hurt in the first place, though> I'd just tell him that he has to demonstrate some reasonable maturity before he does himself a greater harm.\n\nWanting him to not bust his head open isn't bad parenting though. NTA for that.", "NAH \n\nI can see both sides. But as his parent, you have every right to take the skateboard away. He\u2019s correct in that he\u2019ll be an adult soon, but until then, you\u2019re responsible for him and his choices. Since he can\u2019t make the proper choice to let his *broken arm heal*, it was time for you to intervene. \n\nBut, he\u2019ll probably just borrow a buddies board.", "I don't know . I get it that trying new things on a skateboard can lead to broken bones . But he should know better than to do stuntes while his arm is broken like when it get broken again it can get even more serious  he can lose his arm .

I guess you can't do anything about it then let them do their own mistakes .\n\nI saw posts with really uptight parents you are  a worried parten who doesn't want her son get seriously hurt .

But skateboarding has always been dangerous and you've allowed him to do it before... so he's going to see this as unfair punishment for being clumsy.

Otherwise he'll probably just hide it from you and keep pulling away.", "Personally I'd say NTA but suspect I'll be out of step with most Redittors who will be closer to your son's age. Even if he doesn't wind up with a serious injury he's storing up a lot of pain for his later years. I wonder if he's trying to emulate things he's seen on Tiktok or create his own exciting content? Either way he sounds like he's being quite juvenile and irresponsible with it. You don't mention if you're in the US but if so then medical bills will be a factor. \n\nYou're also going to get a lot of flak from people on here for this, mainly because they're likely to be people with no experience of parenthood and limited understanding of adulthood.", "Honestly OP nobody sucks here, I can understand why you\u2019re taking the skateboard because you\u2019re afraid of him getting hurt or being sent to the ER, you\u2019re a parent and you want to keep your son safe, it\u2019s a parent thing, but at the same time your son is 17 and he has the right to make stupid decisions, what you could do here in this situation OP is give him back the skateboard, but tell him that he should be very safe when using it, such as wearing a helmet, as well as elbow pads and kneepads, even the best skateboarder in the world like Tony Hawk wear protective gear, when doing their tricks, and tell him just to be more careful such as don\u2019t do any tricks, you don\u2019t think you can do, and think about your limitations.", "I have a skater at home who is currently 16 years old. He has had a broken arm, and also broke his elbow severe enough that he has had three surgeries, and a busted chin in last few years. There is no way he would be allowed that skateboard or to even scooter just down the street why he was healing. Luckily, this was never an issue. My teen didn't want another three week stay in children's hospital so he respected what the doctors ordered and didn't skate for 6 months while he was healing.

As a parent I fully get and appreciate your intention to keep your kid safe but this is not the right way.

The benefits of allowing bones and skin time to heal.\nAre you supportive of his hobby? \n\nLastly, taking away his board won't keep him from skateboarding, I would wager his friends have boards he could hop on.", "NTA. from a medical perspective, you would be a negligent parent if you let him skateboard while his arm is broken. at the same time, it isn\u2019t normal for a 17 year old to not be exercising any logic. maybe something else is going on in his life that you are unaware of.", "NTA", "NTA- You're a parent, not his friend.

You cant protect him from scrapes and bruises forever. It hurts but its time to cut the cord and let him make his own mistakes. As long as he is wearing a helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, mouth gaurd, etc. then you need to let it go.", "NTA. I was conflicted at first but hearing he is still \"doing\" crazy tricks with a broken arm is just downright stupid. Human instinct would be to put your arms out to catch yourself when falling and now he's at a much higher risk. One bad fall and he can turn a temporary injury into a permanent one. I'm sure future son will be grateful for your decision in \\~10 years.", "Info: Did you buy that skateboard or did your son pay for it with his own $?", "NTA. He's not an adult yet and you're not taking it to crush his dreams or whatever. I hate skateboards because I have seen so many horrible injuries from them, my brother ripped off all the skin from his forearms.

He's a young adult and in less than a year he will be an adult and you risk him going low/no contact. And that's what I would do.
