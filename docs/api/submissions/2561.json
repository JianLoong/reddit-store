Let the religion discussion happen between them on its own time", "NTA. It's not your secret to share, it's up to the husband to decide when/if he wants to share it.\n\nIt would be different if this was an issue of the husband doing something wrong like cheating, in which case I would probably have told you to do something about it, because it's not fair to your sister. But his lack of faith is not a crime.", "This is a secret that is correct to keep. He is harming  no one. Personal faith is no one else's  business.  Telling would serve no purpose  other than betraying the man", "NTA this is not a secret that would effect your sister at all if you kept it. At some point he may come clean, and that\u2019s fine. It is not a secret that could hurt her (ex cheating, gambling, secret drinking etc) so you are well within your right to keep it to yourself.

It was really shitty of him to tell you and ask you to keep it secret in the first place. He's a big boy and should be able to have an honest conversation with his wife. Instead he's going to her little brother, which is just a weird move all round.\n\nSo absolutely you are NTA for wanting to stay out of it. You're not betraying her trust by not telling her, BIL's insecurities shouldn't need to be any of your business. If you're close with your sister and want to tell her, you are NTA for that either. The only AH here is BIL for asking you to keep secrets from your sister, and for being dishonest with his wife.

This is between your sister and her husband, you are not involved in this.  \n\nAs to that absolute statement, I would disagree with it.  There are always grey areas that need to be carefully managed, personally, I feel that it comes down to choosing the least amount of harm.  \n\nFor you right now to get into their marriage would be harmful, you would lose the trust your BIL had in you, you would be causing conflict and pain in their relationship.  All over a \"belief\"?  Not worth it.  \n\nNTA for keeping this to yourself.", "NTA. Keep the secret.  It\u2019s not for you to tell.", "He shouldn't have put this on a 16 year old ffs.

But I think you need to ask BIL to keep it a secret that you knew about this fact if ever he decides to open up to your sister.  You might even be able to help him open up if you talk about your Atheism with your sister and she's accepting of it, he might feel like he can finally open up to her too.\n\nEven Mother Teresa had doubts about her faith, so hopefully your sister won't ever let something like this come between their marriage/love for one another if she finds out.  But either way, this is NOT your secret to share.  It doesn't put her at any sort of risk for disease or infection, it's about personal beliefs.  And what your mother thinks about couples and secrets really doesn't apply here.  He didn't share this secret with your mother.\n\nI just don't see how it harms anyone that he has this personal belief, so I'm in favor of him being allowed to keep this to himself and shared with you.  It's a shame he can't be honest though, and that he fears that it would change the relationship since he loves her regardless of her beliefs, it'd be nice if she afforded him  that same respect. Especially since he's apparently willing to join her when she goes to worship, presumably.\n\nI think it's fine to be a safe person for him to discuss this with, and that it's one of those secrets that is harmless to keep.", "NTA for not telling her. \n\nHe really needs to, though.

Will keeping this secret hurt anybody?  Not in this lifetime.  Will spilling the secret hurt anyone?  Absolutely!

This is the sort of secret that isn\u2019t so bad to keep, more of one you just pay attention to. If he\u2019s told you, it\u2019s likely he is going to tell his wife soon anyway.

Discussing religion isn't the same as that.\n\nI don't consider a private discussion with a teenage relative about religion to be the least bit inappropriate.", "or maybe, since he's family, he has noted a certain detachment when it comes to religious stuff that prompted him to think; \"im going to provide OP with a safe space to talk about those feelings so i can help him\".\n\nI have done this with my own neices in my 20's with a slightly larger age gap. The result? my neices know they can come to me with shit that's not easy to talk to their parents about, and i've helped them navigate certain issues in life because i can relate to them in a way their parents and my sister cannot. In my case i had less rights than this guy, cause my nieces are really step-nieces, so i'm even more removed than OP and this guy are.\n\nAlso, the BIL asked the OP how HE felt about god before the BIL said anything- which means BIL was trying to tell the kid some stories about his own journey, so he would feel safe to talk. Doesn't sound to me like he was burdening OP with anything. Was it the best judgment call? Maybe not, but it's the judgments of 'grooming' and accusations of ephebophilia that i find super bloody disturbing. sorry.", "i think jumping to a sexual attraction to teenagers -right away- just because OP was asked to keep a secret is a little fukt.\n\nI remember countless time out with adults as a adolescent/teenager, where a piece of info was revealed in conversation that they afterwards asked me to keep to myself for the sake of peace (not upsetting my grandma/ their spouse/my mother). I always appreciated it, and not a one of them were EVER trying to get into my pants. They were just trying to treat me as a whole person, instead of as a kid requiring molly-coddling all the time. I was young, but old enough to realize the issues in our family dynamics and that some things are better kept secret- it gave me a safe space to go to for clarity when i needed it, too. (Eta: god knows i did need places to go for clarity- these experiences objectively improved my life)\n\nOP's BIL was probably trying to establish with his family member (who he might have recognized himself in) that he was a safe space to go to to discuss things that might not be so easy to talk about with other family members with religious prejudices, etc. .BTW, *most* people bond by sharing secrets and personal experiences- that's just intimate conversation, and it's OK to have that with people who aren't your spouse or parents. It doesn't HAVE to be nefarious. that's all I'm saying.", "Their brain development? The law? The way predators manipulate them\u2026", "I'll take \"missing the point\" for $500.", "It pertaining to religion doesn't matter. BIL asking a minor he's related to by marriage \"don't tell anyone this secret I have,\" THAT is the thing that's not okay.", "Discussing religion is cool. Going out to bond is also fine. \n\nEstablishing that they are both closeted atheists with serious consequences should that be outed and that they both want to move away doesn't give you any red flags?\n\nIt is not just BIL that shared a secret. OP also shared a secret. There could be consequences should the secrets get out.\n\nHe must keep this secret from his family to protect his BIL and trust BIL enough not to out him. BIL has established both a burden and a threat.", "Your neices coming to YOU is very different from an adult going to a teen. \n\nThat OP is here asking us because they feel conflicted OSS am indication that 28 was wrong. And testing a kid/teen for keeping big secrets is exactly how groomers work.", "There was more to the conversation from OP's comments. That OP is an atheist is also a secret. They also discussed that they both want to move away.\n\nBeing a mentor and a safe person doesn't involve burdening a kid and alienating him from his family. The conversation about his religion turned into BIL dumping on OP about his fear of losing his family. That is a lot to put on a kid. \n\nI am glad your interactions did not end up with you being abused. I hope that BIL is just a person with poor judgement and not a predator. There are red flags with OPs interactions and I feel they need to be pointed out.", "But why the arbitrary of 18? Brain development goes into your 20s. Not every law is a good law. And people can be manipulated at any age.", "No u", "Technically he just said not to tell anyone who may then tell the wife or her family.", "Nope.  No red flags. It's not as though they were in a bed together with tickling going on.  Just a mature discussion about religion that the adult doesn't want shared with his wife or the family.  \n\nI also think it's pretty rare for a man married to a woman to go grooming a minor of the same sex.  So even the statistics would be against this.", "No, i went to them because i could see what their parents couldn't. That's what i mean.\n\nI'm not saying 28 practised good judgment, im saying bad judgment doesnt make 28 a bloody predator by default. That is a dangerous game of occam's razor you're playing there.", "It doesn't alienate OP from his family. BIL told him as much, by confiding he keeps \\[his own athiesm\\] to himself and goes through the motions for the sake of maintaining his close family relationships.\n\nI don't see any alienation in op's question- what i see is a kid wrestling with the ethics of keeping a secret from his sister and asking for an online consensus on the matter.\n\nWhat he's getting instead is a bunch of people telling him his BIL wants to get with him just cause he shared a personal experience and a common ideology with him. ffs.", "I didn\u2019t say anything arbitrary about 18. And being 16 puts OP multiple brain development steps behind 28. \n\nAnd yes, anyone can be manipulated, but it\u2019s easier to manipulate people who are younger or have less cognitive development. That anyone can be manipulated does not mean that this person isn\u2019t being manipulated.", "I have been trying to link the YWCA CSA fact sheet but for some reason I haven't been able to make it work. It is the first thing that came up when  I googled if you are interested. \n\nIt gave information about who abusers are, their marital status and gender and common methods. Below is some of the information about grooming included. \n\n\u2022 Abusers tend to utilize a manipulative process called \u201cgrooming\u201d in order to gain the family\u2019s and \r\nvictim\u2019s trust, providing them with more access to the child.\n\n Grooming behaviors may includexii:\r\n\u2022 Special attention, outings, and gifts\r\n\u2022 Isolating the child from others\r\n\u2022 Filling the child\u2019s unmet needs\r\n\u2022 Filling needs and roles within the family\r\n\u2022 Treating the child as if he or she is older\n Gradually crossing physical boundaries, and becoming increasingly intimate/sexual\r\n\u2022 Use of secrecy, blame, and threats to maintain control\n\nI want to add, It bothers me that you mentioned men in hetero marriages are unlikely to abuse minors of the same gender. Minor sexual abuse is not related to sexuality in the same way.", "But 18 is arbitrary to call someone an adult. And age has nothing to do with how easily someone can be manipulated. The elderly are manipulated every day"]}
