It's not your secret to share, it's up to the husband to decide when/if he wants to share it.\n\nIt would be different if this was an issue of the husband doing something wrong like cheating, in which case I would probably have told you to do something about it, because it's not fair to your sister.

Telling would serve no purpose  other than betraying the man", "NTA this is not a secret that would effect your sister at all if you kept it. At some point he may come clean, and that\u2019s fine.

It was really shitty of him to tell you and ask you to keep it secret in the first place. He's a big boy and should be able to have an honest conversation with his wife. Instead he's going to her little brother, which is just a weird move all round.\n\nSo absolutely you are NTA for wanting to stay out of it. You're not betraying her trust by not telling her, BIL's insecurities shouldn't need to be any of your business. If you're close with your sister and want to tell her, you are NTA for that either.

This is between your sister and her husband, you are not involved in this.  \n\nAs to that absolute statement, I would disagree with it.  There are always grey areas that need to be carefully managed, personally, I feel that it comes down to choosing the least amount of harm.  \n\nFor you right now to get into their marriage would be harmful, you would lose the trust your BIL had in you, you would be causing conflict and pain in their relationship.  All over a \"belief\"?  Not worth it.  \n\nNTA for keeping this to yourself.", "NTA. Keep the secret.  It\u2019s not for you to tell.", "He shouldn't have put this on a 16 year old ffs.

But I think you need to ask BIL to keep it a secret that you knew about this fact if ever he decides to open up to your sister.  You might even be able to help him open up if you talk about your Atheism with your sister and she's accepting of it, he might feel like he can finally open up to her too.\n\nEven Mother Teresa had doubts about her faith, so hopefully your sister won't ever let something like this come between their marriage/love for one another if she finds out.  But either way, this is NOT your secret to share.  It doesn't put her at any sort of risk for disease or infection, it's about personal beliefs.  And what your mother thinks about couples and secrets really doesn't apply here.  He didn't share this secret with your mother.\n\nI just don't see how it harms anyone that he has this personal belief, so I'm in favor of him being allowed to keep this to himself and shared with you.  It's a shame he can't be honest though, and that he fears that it would change the relationship since he loves her regardless of her beliefs, it'd be nice if she afforded him  that same respect. Especially since he's apparently willing to join her when she goes to worship, presumably.\n\nI think it's fine to be a safe person for him to discuss this with, and that it's one of those secrets that is harmless to keep.", "NTA for not telling her. \n\nHe really needs to, though.

Your mom is right that there as a rule of thumb couples shouldn't keep secrets, but part of becoming an adult is figuring out the exceptions to rules like this.  Will keeping this secret hurt anybody?  Not in this lifetime.  Will spilling the secret hurt anyone?  Absolutely!

This is another groomer box checked.\n\nI mentioned to someone else that a similar example would be if BIL gave OP beer. There would be consequences for both of them should anyone find out and is a common tactic groomers use.\n\nThe beer has nothing to do with sex. It is teaching the victim to keep secrets and creates stakes and a bond against family members. The stakes usually start low (a beer) and escalate until the abuser has control over the victim because the consequences are severe.\n\nI am not sure how strict their families are but BIL seems to have started with higher stakes, he already has power over OP here.\n\nI hope BIL is not an abuser but rather someone with poor judgement.", "So your take is that it can't be grooming because you believe that OP is old enough to have sex with his BIL and there is nothing wrong with that?
