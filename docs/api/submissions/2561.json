It's not your secret to share, it's up to the husband to decide when/if he wants to share it.\n\nIt would be different if this was an issue of the husband doing something wrong like cheating, in which case I would probably have told you to do something about it, because it's not fair to your sister.

Telling would serve no purpose  other than betraying the man", "NTA this is not a secret that would effect your sister at all if you kept it. At some point he may come clean, and that\u2019s fine.

It was really shitty of him to tell you and ask you to keep it secret in the first place. He's a big boy and should be able to have an honest conversation with his wife. Instead he's going to her little brother, which is just a weird move all round.\n\nSo absolutely you are NTA for wanting to stay out of it. You're not betraying her trust by not telling her, BIL's insecurities shouldn't need to be any of your business. If you're close with your sister and want to tell her, you are NTA for that either.

This is between your sister and her husband, you are not involved in this.  \n\nAs to that absolute statement, I would disagree with it.  There are always grey areas that need to be carefully managed, personally, I feel that it comes down to choosing the least amount of harm.  \n\nFor you right now to get into their marriage would be harmful, you would lose the trust your BIL had in you, you would be causing conflict and pain in their relationship.  All over a \"belief\"?  Not worth it.  \n\nNTA for keeping this to yourself.", "NTA. Keep the secret.  It\u2019s not for you to tell.", "He shouldn't have put this on a 16 year old ffs.

But I think you need to ask BIL to keep it a secret that you knew about this fact if ever he decides to open up to your sister.  You might even be able to help him open up if you talk about your Atheism with your sister and she's accepting of it, he might feel like he can finally open up to her too.\n\nEven Mother Teresa had doubts about her faith, so hopefully your sister won't ever let something like this come between their marriage/love for one another if she finds out.  But either way, this is NOT your secret to share.  It doesn't put her at any sort of risk for disease or infection, it's about personal beliefs.  And what your mother thinks about couples and secrets really doesn't apply here.  He didn't share this secret with your mother.\n\nI just don't see how it harms anyone that he has this personal belief, so I'm in favor of him being allowed to keep this to himself and shared with you.  It's a shame he can't be honest though, and that he fears that it would change the relationship since he loves her regardless of her beliefs, it'd be nice if she afforded him  that same respect. Especially since he's apparently willing to join her when she goes to worship, presumably.\n\nI think it's fine to be a safe person for him to discuss this with, and that it's one of those secrets that is harmless to keep.", "NTA for not telling her. \n\nHe really needs to, though.

Your mom is right that there as a rule of thumb couples shouldn't keep secrets, but part of becoming an adult is figuring out the exceptions to rules like this.  Will keeping this secret hurt anybody?  Not in this lifetime.  Will spilling the secret hurt anyone?  Absolutely!

My mother still prays that I will change my mind and join her in heaven after death (I got the crying response).  It also means his marriage vows were lies if it was anything like most of the protestant weddings I've been to, there was lots of in God's service thrown in there.

If you confided that to him, and he told your parents you would feel hurt and betrayed.  Difference is, your loyalty is with your sister, and you are now between a rock and a hard place.  \n\nPart of being an adult is learning that sometimes people will confide in you, and when it is and isn't your place to share their secrets. Example: he tells you he's a functional alcoholic, yes share because he could cause others physical harm by driving drunk. He tells you he's doesn't like your sister's cooking, no, don't share it because there is no immediate danger.   Third example, you find out your guy friend is gay, and married to you female friend...what do you do?  It's not cool to out someone, but it's also not cool to keep that from your other friend...there's a possibility that telling her will make her hate you because she will be in denial and will look to take her anger out somewhere.  In that situation, I'd encourage my friend to tell the truth.\n\nWhile those are some extreme examples, this does fall somewhere in the middle, where someone's feelings can get hurt, and it could damage a relationship.

When I was mid 20s I hinted that I wasn't feeling it too much anymore, and since then haven't gone to church in 15 years other than weddings, baptisms, misc celebrations (my wife's aunt is a nun, so there are times we get invited).  They all know how we feel about religion, but we never disrespect them and their beliefs and happily go through the motions for family, because we love them.  More than religion, love is what binds us, and as long as your BIL loves your sister, there hope they can work through it.  He might have to work some stuff out internally before he's prepared to tell, but hopefully he loves her enough to be honest. And if not, and he keeps going through the motions, just assume that he found faith and leave it at that, because as a Benedictine would believe, actions are as important as intentions.\n\n\"If any pilgrim monk come from distant parts, with a wish to dwell as a guest in the monastery, and will be content with the customs which he finds in the place, and do not perchance by his lavishness disturb the monastery, but is simply content with what he finds: he shall be received, for as long a time as he desires. If, indeed, he would find fault with anything, or expose it, it, reasonably, and with the humility of charity, the Abbot shall discuss it prudently lest perchance God has sent him for this very thing. But if he have been found gossipy and contumacious in the time of his sojourn as guest, not only ought he not to be joined to the body of the monastery, but also it shall be said to him, honestly, that he must depart.

She married a man who pretended to be just as religious as she was. She taught at a Christian school.

Three years later she calls me to tell me they're getting a divorce. She found out that he had taken out about a dozen or so credit cards in her name by making applications online in quick succession so nothing showed up on the credit report other than possibly an inquiry.\nHe forged her signature on documents for other loans, and basically she was left bankrupt and heartbroken. So my thoughts are if you're going to lie about religion to get into a marriage, then you will lie about anything and it will only lead to heartbreak.\n\nShe could see this as a major betrayal by her husband and the relationship may never recover. Without knowing exactly how religious the sister is, or what denomination they are, it's hard to say exactly what her reaction would be, but it does seem like she is fairly religious.

If BIL has only lived in predominantly Christian areas his whole life, I do feel for him, though.\n\nI'm not Christian, I would likely never get in a serious relationship with one (religious trauma, queer, pagan) but i have a couple of Christian friends.
