Let the religion discussion happen between them on its own time", "NTA. It's not your secret to share, it's up to the husband to decide when/if he wants to share it.\n\nIt would be different if this was an issue of the husband doing something wrong like cheating, in which case I would probably have told you to do something about it, because it's not fair to your sister. But his lack of faith is not a crime.", "This is a secret that is correct to keep. He is harming  no one. Personal faith is no one else's  business.  Tei g would serve no purpose  other than betraying the man", "NTA this is not a secret that would effect your sister at all if you kept it. At some point he may come clean, and that\u2019s fine. It is not a secret that could hurt her (ex cheating, gambling, secret drinking etc) so you are well within your right to keep it to yourself.

It was really shitty of him to tell you and ask you to keep it secret in the first place. He's a big boy and should be able to have an honest conversation with his wife. Instead he's going to her little brother, which is just a weird move all round.\n\nSo absolutely you are NTA for wanting to stay out of it. You're not betraying her trust by not telling her, BIL's insecurities shouldn't need to be any of your business. If you're close with your sister and want to tell her, you are NTA for that either. The only AH here is BIL for asking you to keep secrets from your sister, and for being dishonest with his wife.

This is between your sister and her husband, you are not involved in this.  \n\nAs to that absolute statement, I would disagree with it.  There are always grey areas that need to be carefully managed, personally, I feel that it comes down to choosing the least amount of harm.  \n\nFor you right now to get into their marriage would be harmful, you would lose the trust your BIL had in you, you would be causing conflict and pain in their relationship.  All over a \"belief\"?  Not worth it.  \n\nNTA for keeping this to yourself.", "NTA. Keep the secret.  It\u2019s not for you to tell.", "He shouldn't have put this on a 16 year old ffs.

But I think you need to ask BIL to keep it a secret that you knew about this fact if ever he decides to open up to your sister.  You might even be able to help him open up if you talk about your Atheism with your sister and she's accepting of it, he might feel like he can finally open up to her too.\n\nEven Mother Teresa had doubts about her faith, so hopefully your sister won't ever let something like this come between their marriage/love for one another if she finds out.  But either way, this is NOT your secret to share.  It doesn't put her at any sort of risk for disease or infection, it's about personal beliefs.  And what your mother thinks about couples and secrets really doesn't apply here.  He didn't share this secret with your mother.\n\nI just don't see how it harms anyone that he has this personal belief, so I'm in favor of him being allowed to keep this to himself and shared with you.  It's a shame he can't be honest though, and that he fears that it would change the relationship since he loves her regardless of her beliefs, it'd be nice if she afforded him  that same respect. Especially since he's apparently willing to join her when she goes to worship, presumably.\n\nI think it's fine to be a safe person for him to discuss this with, and that it's one of those secrets that is harmless to keep.", "NTA for not telling her. \n\nHe really needs to, though.

Will keeping this secret hurt anybody?  Not in this lifetime.  Will spilling the secret hurt anyone?  Absolutely!

You're not even Christian yourself, so why start drama over a conviction that you don't even hold?", "NTA. Keep it to yourself.

This is the sort of secret that isn\u2019t so bad to keep, more of one you just pay attention to. If he\u2019s told you, it\u2019s likely he is going to tell his wife soon anyway.

And it sounds like you two have a good relationship so I'm sure he's relieved to have someone he can trust to talk to about this.", "you know this because.....", "No all adults aren't groomers but it does sound a bit suss when you think of a 30 year old man confiding in a teenager and asking them to keep a secret. 95% of the time it's probably completely innocent but it happens enough that it's a valid concern. Why didn't the BIL confide in his friends or work colleague?", "Only the ones who invite teens out for \"bonding\" time one on one and ask kids to keep secrets.", "But that ally shouldn\u2019t be your wife\u2019s teenage brother.

How absurd. This is an adult trying to develop a relationship with his actual brother in law who is 16 and capable of having conversations about their views on God. \n\nFfs.

I'm assuming OP's parents and sister were well aware this was happening. BIL probably had an idea that OP might share his (non)belief, and wanted to confide in someone who was close to his wife but also understood. \n\nIMO \"hey I'm atheist, please don't tell your family until I can bring it up to them\" is much different than \"hey I think you're really cool and special, but don't tell your family I said that\" or something of the like.", "OP is part of his family.

People need to stop projecting all the time....", "Bro what is this take, go touch grass. It's not putting op anywhere. All op has to do is not say anything. It's not like the secret is gonna kill someone.", "Wtf literally explain to me how it's inappropriate", "a teenager is a child until they turn 18.", "Sorry OP, genuine mistake.
