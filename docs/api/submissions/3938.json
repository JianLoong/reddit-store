Be happy for her, but that doesn't change your no contact decision.", "NTA.  Dad is an abuser.  He abused you.  IMO there should be no contact with him.  Avoiding him is an act of self-preservation.  It is not anger or hate.   Mom and sis think he has changed.  Maybe he has, but it may just be an act.  Usually, abusers escalate.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**YOur husband is an AH**. He should have your back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust avoid the wedding. **Your sister is fine to have her dad in her life ... but it is a reasonable boundary for you not to go to events where your abuser is invited.**\n\nYOur sister is an AH for trying to blindside you with pushing your abuser at you.", "NTA\n\nYou love your sister, but don't want anything to do with your father. Don't be upset with your sister though, as she is allowed to have a different relationship with him. Express that you're happy for her marriage, but won't be attending/hosting the ceremony. I think there are other events/ways to show your support for her marriage, like a bridal shower, if that is something you are open to.\n\nETA: Sister is kinda the AH for asking you to plan this wedding and then trying to hide this important info from you. She should have been up front when she asked you to host, especially knowing it might have affected your decision.", "NTA no one has to be around their abuser ever.", "NTA. It doesn't matter how your sister feels, how your mum feels or what your husband thinks. None of them have the same experiences or the same effects from those experiences as you do and they have no right to tell you how to feel.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to forgive your dad and you don\u2019t have to have any contact with him. It wasn\u2019t nice of your sis to spring it on you, but at least it happened before the wedding. That would have been a nasty surprise to not know he was coming to the wedding.", "NTA. Pretty much NAH unless your sister doesn't let you just opt out .\n\nYou and your sister had similar, but not the same exposure to your father. Because of the large age gap, I'm guessing you got the worst of it or even protected her from seeing most of it.\n\nI seem to have been the \"lucky\" one to have been sexually abused by a family member.  Can't stand to be in the same vicinity as the bastard, but the rest of the family can, including my mom/his sister.\n\nLet her know you can't be around him, but let her know that she is free to have a relationship with him.\n\nEdit to add: your father was definitely an AH. Any change he has gone through does not have to be acknowledged by YOU. You owe him no consideration.", "NTA, she obviously knew you wouldn\u2019t be ok with it since she tried to hide it from you. She\u2019s allowed to forgive him and build back a relationship with him, but she needs to also respect your boundaries and your decision to have no contact with him. Hopefully this doesn\u2019t affect your relationship with your sister too much and you can still be involved in her wedding in amother way that doesn\u2019t require you to be at the ceremony.", "NTA. Your sister may have reconciled with your abusive father - okay for her. Her lack of forthrightness with *you* makes her an AH. There\u2019s no way you could have continued to plan the wedding without a lot more contact with your abuser than you feel comfortable with.  Since you have stepped down as planner, you have the choice of how much to participate in, or even whether to attend, your sister\u2019s wedding.", "NTA. You need to put yourself first here, to protect yourself. No one else gets to decide how you want to interact or not interact with your dad.", "NTA, what your sister does with her life is her business. \n\nHowever, you are also not required to involve yourself in it in any way, especially when it involves someone who abused you for years.", "NAH\n\nYour sister shouldn't feel bad for having a relationship with your father. If she has forgiven him, feels that he is healthier and wants him in her life then that is totally okay of her to do. \n\nYou should not feel like you have to attend if you are uncomfortable being around your (abusive) father. It is equally within your right to do what will make you feel comfortable and safe.", "NTA He may be different now but that doesn't change the fact that he abused you. Your sister may have been too young at the time to be aware of the extent of the abuse, or maybe did not bear the brunt of it as you did. She's chosen to forgive him, for whatever reasons, but that doesn't mean you have to. Forgiving can feel a lot like saying \"it was okay this happened\" and no, it's not okay, abuse is never be okay. The fact that she kept this a secret, the way that she did, asking you to host her wedding. What did she think was going to happen? He was just going to show up and you were supposed to smile and suck it up? That's an abusive mindset in the making right there, \"I will get what I want, regardless of how others suffer.\" Yikes.", "NTA bc sister is.  You agreed to provide this assistance to you sister, and she knew that was contingent on no choice contact with abuser.  She violated and breached that implicit term.  You did not berate or abuse her in response, you simply removed yourself.  Your conduct was appropriate and kind.  Sister\u2019s deception has cost her.", "NTA. This is your choice. It's not up to other people to decide who you have to see.", "NTA, my heart goes out to you and please, get some counselling as you have been triggered. \n\nYour father may have \"changed\" but has he ever tried to make amends with you?  It's all too easy for others to excuse him if you were bearing the brunt of his abuse. They can rationalise it away somehow. \n\nYour sister is an AH because she deliberately hid this information from you, knowing it would hurt. She wanted to make sure you did all the hard to plan the wedding so it wouldn't matter if you pulled out. She was using you. \n\nYour mother is an AH too. She's still in contact with your abuser. If she's anything like my mother she would stand and watch while I was being beaten, and often directed my dad's anger towards me. \n\nAnd finally, your husband. Have you told him exactly what your dad did and said to you?  How your dad's abuse of your little sister scarred you as well? Your memories don't get to fade quite so easily.  He needs to be 100% with you here as you re-live your trauma and not scoff at you ever again.", "INFO and NTA\n\nHas Dad changed? Has he admitted to his prior behavior? Were the things he did something you can just apologize for once and it's all good? Is this another Reddit case of 'Bride always wished her Dad was better and dreamed of him walking her down the aisle?' If the Dad is so much better did he ever reach out to OP to try to heal that relationship?\n\nJust looking at these questions leads me straight to NTA. If the Bride wants her Dad there she should face the consequences with open eyes. Don't let her fool you into \"It's my wedding and everyone should do *anything* to make my dream day come true.\" Personally, I wouldn't attend the wedding but would not go so far as to cut them all out of my life. I would be consistent in not attending any functions the abuser is invited to attend.\n\nIt is not up to the abused to make amends. That falls only to the abuser.", "So your willing to ruin your relationship with your sister over something that has NOTHING to do with her. If she was able to reconcile with him then it\u2019s just your grudge and that\u2019s all. My judgment YTA. Either talk to your father or get therapy but don\u2019t drag your sister into your issues.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like your sister was part of the abuse, so I have to wonder why you want to continue a relationship with her too\u2026\n\nYour husband is totally wrong on this.  This is a matter with your family.  He is your husband, he is supposed to be on your side and support you in your decisions.  He should be asking questions to understand why you feel the way you do.  He should not be telling you that you are completely wrong when he didn\u2019t have to live through the abuse that you did.  If you haven\u2019t told him specifics about the abuse, it may be time to do that.", "NTA.  None of them get to decide when or if you resume any contact with your dad. You are totally allowed to make your own choices and decisions on this. Do not be bullied and belittled into going along with their white washing narrative just because it makes them feel better about the past. \n\nYour husband also has zero view on this and I frankly judge him the worst for not supporting you- at least your family have their own trauma responses to blame\u2026", "NTA\u2026if they truly didn\u2019t think it was a bad thing, they wouldn\u2019t have tried to hide it. She is allowed to talk to her dad, just like you are allowed to never look at him again. You to the best way, and let her have her relationship while keeping your mental health intact by keeping your distance. If they cannot understand that you cannot force forgiveness for abuse, then that is on them.", "NTA- I would just tell them- I am not telling you who you can have at your wedding, I am not telling you who you can forgive or make peace with. I am telling you that there is no peace for me and that you also cannot tell me to subject myself to be in the presence of my abuser.\n\nI'm not telling you to forgive him either- but if there's a chance you can find peace and the man is changed- under the guidance of a therapist, this is something that you could consider working towards- not so that you can attend the wedding, but if it is possible to resolve childhood trauma to something that haunts you less.", "NTA the fact that they didn't tell you upfront meant that they knew you would be upset and maybe some guilt. It's ok not to go.", "NTA NTA NTA. Your husband needs to support your decision or at the very least keep his opinion to himself. You do not need to sacrifice your comfort for your abuser", "I\u2019m sorry that your family did this. I\u2019m more sorry that your husband is not being supportive. I\u2019m sorry that you probably feel alone in this. Reddit supports you!", "NTA. You're 6 years older, so you have more memories of abuse than she does. Could that be part of why she thinks it's okay to force a meeting between you and your \"dad\".", "NTA. If your sister and mom want to have a relationship with your dad that is their right and their business. What neither of them have is the right to ambush you at her wedding with a reunion with that man. They know how you feel about him and out of courtesy should have given you a heads up about his invitation.", "Edit: because people are misreading : the question posed isn't \"AITA for not willing to reconnect with my abusive father.\" Because the answer to that is clearly no it's not. The ESH is because I think she needs to still talk to her sister about everything and not burn that relationship because she does love and care about her sister even if she doesn't plan / host the wedding. \n\n\nI'm going to go against the popular opinion here and say ESH but hear me out! \n\n If you do not want to have a relationship with your father and want nothing to do with him that's fine. Now I feel your sister, knowing how you feel about your father, should have been upfront and being mad about that is perfectly acceptable.  \n\nYou love your sister, and if she's not pushing you to try and reconnect, I feel it's wrong to be mad at her for reconnecting.  If he truly has changed and she was able to rebuild a relationship then that's her choice.  And if it turns out he really didn't, then at least she'll know she still has her sister to be there and love her regardless.  You don't have to support the decision but in the end, you can only control yourself and if you do not want to have any part of the wedding, then she needs to respect that you have not forgiven him and cannot be there.  \n\nI hate ultimatums and I know this does seem like a him or me situation, but you're allowed to have boundaries. I know what abuse from a close relative is like, and had to cut people out of my life for crossing those boundaries.  \n\nBut there is a part of me that has me wondering. Does your dad know he was abusive? Has he ever reached out to you to reconnect? Does he know you're a wedding planner? I feel like if he's changed, he wouldve asked your sister if you are aware that she and he have a relationship. I know this is weird speculation and maybe the way I think, but I guess I figure if he changed, he wouldn't want to involve himself if that meant it would mean you wouldn't be there.", "I don't think her husband is an asshole. I'm assuming he knows how close she is with her sister and wants to make sure she's not just emotionally charged and wont regret the situation in the future.  I'm not saying the sister isn't in the wrong at all because she is, but maybe she just rose colored glasses the situation hoping it would all work out.", "Why would she not be upset with a family member being on good terms with someone who physically and mentally abused her? Imagine this is an ex instead of their father. Most people wouldn't think it acceptable for the sister to be friends with her abusive ex.", "Seriously 'Does your abuser (dad) know that he was abusive?' What part of physical is not abuse. NTA  @cynnabella you are an AH for suggesting the poster is one. \ud83d\ude48 OMG", "I think you misunderstand. Some people who are abusive aren't self aware. Like you know the types of people are like \"im not abusive my son is just a weak and shouldn't cry! He needs to be a man\" then proceeds to belt him. I'm not condoning any kind of abuse. I'm literally wondering if the father knew he sucked.\n\nEdit: hit enter too soon\n\nIt's more for a question when it comes to her sister, will she be let down if it was all a charade kind of situation and he hasn't really changed because he never acknowledged he was abusive.\n\n And no where did I say the op is a liar.\n\nThe question wasn't \"aita for not reconnecting with my abusive father\"  Because if it was the answer is no she's not period."]}
