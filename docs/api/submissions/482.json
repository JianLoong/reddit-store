From their perspective, while they are supportive of you needing to make changes with little to no warning, they were relying on you to be available and now their plans have to change.

Sometimes nannies get sick! Your precious baby comes first, always. You might want to ask the couple you babysit for if in the future another case like this comes up, would it be ok to bring your son so that you don't have to cancel last minute.

Their employee had to cancel last minute to take care of their child. They have children; they should understand that a child\u2019s needs *rarely* keep a regular schedule and **always** come first. I get that you feel you have a relationship that goes beyond employer/employee, but that makes them look even worse imo. They know you\u2019re in a nightmarish custody battle and they know how much it means for you to get **any** extra time with your son- let alone Halloween itself. You\u2019re not the asshole, but let this be a wake up call for you. You may love them beyond the bounds of a professional relationship, but it\u2019s not mutual. They expect you to prioritize their family over yours.\n\n~~INFO: How did you meet this family? Is this a working relationship that has grown beyond that in your estimation? As in, are you their nanny but after two years you consider them your friends? Or did you agree to do this for your friends?~~ Asked and answered.", "Not the asshole.
