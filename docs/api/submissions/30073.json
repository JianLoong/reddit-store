I have been taking care of her with my family but my husband primarily does and I do feel guilty about the whole thing. She does have two daughters living with her that take great care of her.

You don't have to wish someone dead to be rude or insensitive. And this was hugely insensitive to your husband's situation right now.", "NTA wanting to move doesn\u2019t mean you want her dead.

Emotions are high and he doesnt want to leave his Mother which is again completely understandable. \n\nIts not selfish to want to pursue your dreams, and certainly not selfish to want to ask/communicate that you would like to.\n\nBut there probably couldve been more tact in understanding that moving while his mother is terminally ill, would definitely tear into what time there may be left, an it could give a big possibility of not being there for the last possible moments. \n\nSo you asking to move, is in direct conflict of that.", "I don't think that a desire to move on to a different chapter in your lives makes you morbid even if that chapter needs to wait until someone dies.\n\nI also think that not being 100% selfless doesn't make you selfish. It's like a spectrum and it's unhealthy to be at either end.\n\nNTA because it seems like there will always be something. My aunt and uncle, in their 40s or so, started living separately due to something about his work. They're still married. Perhaps you could move to Alaska to do college and he can stay there to take care of Mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Neither of you should feel guilty about that. His stance is firm. He wishes to be with his dying mother. It seems as though that is non-negotiable for him.

He only has one mom, and she's only in one location.\n\nHowever, you would become TA if you forced him to pick between you and her.", "NTA; it sounds like your husband transferred his feelings into the conversation instead of where they belong. There's nothing wrong with wanting to pursue your passions now that you can. I hope he can calm down and have a reasonable conversation with you in which he can separate the topics.", "NTA. not morbid either. At my age - 60+, I realize that the time energy and good health to fulfill my dreams is getting shorter.  What am I willing to sacrifice to follow my dreams? Could I live separately from my spouse for a while? Can I take a different path, away from someone I love?", "NTA. What you want isn't morbid. Your husband should look up big words before using them in an argument.", "NTA\n\nCall me blunt but you aren\u2019t an AH.  Why should you have to put your dreams/plans on hold because of her??

Wanting to experience life while you can is the opposite of morbid. \n\nWhat is tying you in place? Are there other family members there? Does your mother-in-law receive services there that she can't get anywhere else? If you move, does it have to mean leaving her behind?\n\nA friend of mine was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at a fairly young age. She retired, and then she and her husband traveled all over North America in an RV for over a decade. I don't know how bad she got before she died, but her family says she was happy doing what she loved with the person she loved. That's not going to work for everyone, obviously, and your mother-in-law in law may be past the point of being able to travel, but it sounds like your husband won't consider any possible alternatives. \n\nAgain, NTA, and please come visit r/dementia", "Why does his wants become before OPs??  We don\u2019t know how long the mother will last.  It could be 1 year it could be 10.  Who determines whose wants is the top priority??\n\nI get he wants to be close but it doesn\u2019t sound like OP is barring him from ever seeing her.  He could still travel and see her. Why should she have to put her wants/needs/desires on hold be cause OPs mom had a bad health diagnosis???", "I think you missed a \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d in your second paragraph", "You are correct.
