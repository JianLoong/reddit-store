Your argument about not wanting to pay for something that isn't in your name makes no difference as you are supposedly getting married and it won't matter but you're afraid that he's going to have you pay towards the mortgage to leave you and take your money and run? Your just making up an excuse to not pay. None of what you said is relevant to your argument. You would be paying rent not a mortgage. There's nothing wrong with the arrangement you and your partners expense splitting but refusing to pay anything simply because your name is not on the mortgage is just an excuse to get out of contributing.", "The solution is fine if everybody is okay with it! Outside opinions don't matter in this case. You guys seem to have a plan to get your name on the deed once you're married.
