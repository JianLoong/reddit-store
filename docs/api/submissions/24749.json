If so, I think you need to talk to a trusted adult about this. If there is nothing physically stopping him from not pooping himself, then it's some kind of behavioural/mental thing and that needs to be corrected/treated. If he were physically unable to hold it in he would need to be in diapers. So, whatever the reason is, something needs to be done. Talk to an aunt or uncle or grandparent, or your teacher. You shouldn't have to live like this. Aside from the smell, this is a health hazard for everyone in the house (including your poopy brother and your youngest brother).", "NTA and if I were you I'd move out as quickly as possible. Like grandma home, auntie, uncle? Friends? Significant other?\n\nLike GTFO NOW\n\n+ \n\nCall CPS on their ass. They need it. Your brother needs saving.", "NTA. But we as Reddit people cannot help you enough right now. You absolutely need to contact a trusted adult. This is unsafe and dangerous behavior. I know it might just feel \u201cgross\u201d right now, but it\u2019s seriously concerning. If you have a teacher, please tell them what is happening. Is you feel like you don\u2019t have another adult this [helpline](https://www.childhelphotline.org) might help you. If you live in the US, you might want to contact cps, find their number [here](https://www.childwelfare.gov/organizations/?CWIGFunctionsaction=rols:main.dspList&rolType=custom&rs_id=5). I promise you are not overreacting.

He just shouted at me though, telling me to \u201cshut the fuck up because you\u2019re really getting on my nerves now\u201d. Sorry it\u2019s not a very positive update, but atleast that option is gone. Thank you to all the people telling me to go to a trusted adult, but unfortunately i don\u2019t really have anyone i really trust that i could go to with this. This has been happening for over a year now, nobody in the family listens to me about it and reddit was my last option to get advice on what to do. Thank you again to everyone commenting your advice.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a really strange situation. Do you have other family members that can talk to your parents about it?", "NTA Your parents are clearly not addressing a very serious issue. Feces is bio hazard waste. Tracking it all over the house is a health hazard not just an unpleasant smell. You need to speak to a trusted teacher or school counselor. I am a mandatory reporter and I absolutely would be reporting this to CPS if you came to me because of the risks. You can always call CPS yourself, it\u2019s anonymous. CPS can be a whole can of shitty unpredictable worms itself, but it could very likely be the trigger for your brother to receive the serious real help he needs.", "NTA.  Call cps and let them know your situation.  This may be the kick in the pants your parents need to nip this.  Unbelievably gross.  So sorry you have crap parents.", "NTA. My less than 2 yo toddler can goes to the toilet. That is not even toddler conduct.\n\nYour brother just made a habit out of it because your parents have not done anything to correct him. That is just not an unacceptable conduct/habit for him.", "NTA Scary. You may want to research narcissistic parents and the terms \"golden child\" and \"black sheep\". I know people are throwing those words around a lot these days, but your situation fits the bill. You are not even the one to blame, he is putting the entire household at biohazardous risk, parents included. The real concern is you and your 9 yr old brother. Tell a teacher, tell his teachers. The key factor is he KNOWS how not to do it at school or when his friends are over. It's not an accident and it can be helped. Something is just not right with him. At the end of the day, your family situation is nowhere close to normal and you need to look into social services if you can't confide in any friend's parents. My guess is this is not the only blatant thing your parents let him do.", "NTA\n\nPart of me wants to tell you to tell his friends all about him defecating himself intentionally cause he's too lazy to go use the toilet. \n\nThe bigger more grown up part of me knows that would be wrong and advises you don't do that.

How do I know you might ask? well because only punishment I got at home, was getting beat up with wooden spoon, for almost anything, (even stuff i didnt do) also I was verbal bullied in school a lot. And I stopped shitting myself when my mom got therapy and beating stopped and in school the bullying stopped because the main bully moved.\n\nso yeah it can actually be not his fault, he can be bullied at school or at home without you knowing.

Not safe for you, your nine year old brother or the brother who shits himself. Your worthless sacks that are parents are terrible. Call CPS. And they call you a \"bully\"?

Your parents are really not doing the right thing by letting him soil himself. Is your brother really immersed in videogames or TV or something that he would rather poop himself than pause the game? That's not healthy or acceptable behaviour. Does he have to wash his own underwear/towels/chair (whatever he shits on)? If not, I think that is probably what your parents should make him do. He's 13, not 4. If he is capable of being house trained but chooses not to, then he is capable of cleaning up after himself later. But even then, the smell is affecting others in the house.\n\nHow long has this been going on for? What is his reason for shitting himself?\n\nETA: I don't know how old you are but I am guessing older than your 9 year old brother. You are not responsible for your 9 year old brother's safety but his safety and health are also at risk because of your poopy brother and your parents allowing your poopy brother to poop himself.
