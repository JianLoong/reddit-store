They just generally say what they want when they want, and they\u2019ll say it as loud as it necessary in the moment. We\u2019ve hosted last year and this year. I offered to cook, his mother wouldn\u2019t let me. I would cook the day before, she insists on doing all the cooking the day of. This means our house becomes a high-stress zone from 7am to 2pm.\n\nThey woke us up to set up a table two hours before company was expected.\n\nThe next part is foggy as I spent time outside. What I did hear around noon was my boyfriend arguing over where his gallon of sugar-free sweet tea went with his mother because she was the only one in the kitchen. \n\nIn my head I thought \u201cshe said she doesn\u2019t know and it\u2019s not a big deal\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t let it go. This is characteristic of my boyfriend but he\u2019s told me since the beginning that his mother throws other people\u2019s stuff away without asking. Maybe she did throw it out without asking because she needed the fridge space. I don\u2019t know is if she did it with 12 people in the house.\n\nFast forward a couple of hours. My family arrives, we eat, everything is chill. After everyone has broken up around the house my MIL tells my boyfriend that they (his entire side of the family) will be leaving tomorrow, the day after thanksgiving, rather than two days after. This really upset my boyfriend because we live a decent distance from his family and he makes trips down there at least once a quarter while they only come here for thanksgiving.\n\nFast forward another couple of hours. I wander into the kitchen to get some wine that was gifted to me, but the can\u2019t find it. MIL has been in the kitchen the entire time despite being told other people will clean. So I asked her where it was.\n\nShe *screamed* at me. I\u2019m not exaggerating. To my recollection, \u201cI am tired of yall accusing me of moving stuff. I feel like I\u2019m not welcome here and all you want too do is intimidate me! Do not ask me any more questions!\u201d\n\nI was so taken aback and so unused to being spoken this way that I actually laughed. I took a moment and replied, \u201cokay, let\u2019s get this straight. You\u2019re mad at [my BF], not me. That\u2019s between yall. All I did was ask you a question. You will not scream at me. You especially will not scream at me in my own house.\u201d I then walked away because it turns out my BIL had the wine and yelled out that he had it. My MIL continued to mutter that she\u2019d \u201cnever come back here again. Ever.\u201d The rest of our night went on, but I did text my BF (who left the room) that I was sorry for making him uncomfortable if I did.\n\nMy BIL said \u201cyou were both wrong.\u201d My boyfriend thinks I should apologize to her because I was mean. The fight was theirs, not mine. I\u2019m still not inclined to apologize.

Outside of that, she has no rights to EVER treat you the way she did outside of very, VERY particular circumstances.  That goes for just about everyone, actually.\n\nAnd your BF and BIL may have normalized her behavior, but that doesn't mean you should as well.  You need to talk to your BF about setting down some boundaries on behaviors in the relationship and what is and isn't allowed amongst each other's families.  If anyone from your families has a problem with either of you, the partner should the one to handle things.", "NTA I would have kicked her out of my house for yelling at me.

He actually said \u201c[BIL] has never talked to her like that.\u201d To which I thought, \u201cand it shows.\u201d But I didn\u2019t say that. She can be lovely but when she goes off the edge I do firmly believe someone has to say no - and *my mother* taught me how to say no.\n\nAs for talking to him, it\u2019s an ongoing thing. I\u2019ve been in therapy for our whole four years. He went once, wouldn\u2019t open up, and gave up. By his own admission.", "I\u2019m grateful my mother had already left because she would not have loved it. I gave the gentle version.", "To be fair. This is the first time I\u2019ve injected myself in four years so it\u2019s highly likely she did like me because I was quiet.

I think the actual correction is \u201cmy boyfriend never learned boundaries with his mother.\u201d My mother has never shouted at me. She has said things I don\u2019t like that pissed me off and I\u2019ve told her so calmly. But we\u2019ve never yelled.", "I think he honestly agrees.

I have that kind of MIL (who kicked me out of my kitchen on my husband\u2019s any my first Thanksgiving in our house as well) and those few moments of well placed confrontation have helped keep the insanity at bay now that I have kids. You\u2019ve got this.", "His upset should be with his mother though. A good husband would be intervening and telling his mother that he will not tolerate her yelling at his wife. But he won't because he is still afraid of his Mommy.", "Which is bizarre to me since he was arguing with her earlier over a very similar subject (where's the tea), but you come in and ask a question and you don't make a big thing out of it, but somehow you're the villain? \n\nThe only reason I can think of that he would be pissed (and it's not a good reason) is that fighting and being hostile is usually how his family interacts, and that he somehow mistook your refusal to engage with her on her level as rude. And he's taking his disappointment over his family leaving out on you (why he would be disappointed though is beyond me, they sound awful.)", "You were absolutely right to say what you said. Plus, your MIL had crossed quite some boundaries before it came to this.\n\nAlso, I'm not really the marrying kind, but thank you for the offer :)", "This is when it\u2019s appropriate to apologize, but not apologize.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you took offense to my reaction.  I do not do well with voices being raised for simply asking about where an item I was looking for was.\u201d", "But why didn't he learn boundaries?

Which is true. But they only gave 2k over a year ago. If it meant I could have control of my house I\u2019d write them a check. They were just covering a very small threshold.", "I\u2019m doing that behind the scenes, but intervening in a 34 year old man\u2019s relationship with his mother is a tall order. \n\nAnd I\u2019m a 36 year old man, but I\u2019ll be the wife in this scenario ;)", "I am of similar mind. We had our moments early in our relationship. At one point I told him I was getting very tired of explaining why his tone and volume were inappropriate - and I had my issues too. I had to learn that he didn\u2019t know and that trying to be louder is not the way. \n\nBut we\u2019re good and I love him very much. So when he told me I should apologize to her my gut instinct was \u201cso now I gotta teach your mom not to scream at me gently too?\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re a lot and he always says things like \u201cI don\u2019t think they like me.\u201d Which breaks my heart. I\u2019ve never once thought that about my family.", "Honestly. If she had to move the tea, just say where she moved it. Neither the tea nor the wine should be an argument-worthy issue if she had no blame. The fact that BIL had the wine (which wasn't his) says he probably had something to do with the tea too, and MIL was being belligerent in defending him.", "Mmm. I like this.", "I agree. I have the opposite mother. When she was mad she\u2019d tell me why and calmly express what needed to happen. We\u2019ve fought intensely in a different way. We\u2019ve both said \u201cI\u2019m too mad to talk about this but I love you, so let\u2019s come back to it in a couple of days.\u201d\n\nHis is just \u201clet\u2019s see who is louder.\u201d", "That's a very small loan and should not buy the privilege of marching into your house on major holidays and banning you from the kitchen which needs to stop immediately as it is just another way for her to infantilize you and stomp over boundaries. This is my third comment so I'm gonna stop but damn your MIL is awful"]}
