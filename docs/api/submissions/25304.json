Music, TV shows, Video Games, you name it, everything apparently has an agenda. Recently Maria wrongfully assumed that a show I watch, the Owl House on Disney Channel, would have shown two teenage girls in a sexual relationship on the account of some \"leaks\" that she didn't even back up.

One of the songs in Rotation was \"Queen\" by Stephen Jerzak. However, one thing was that Maria came in and listened for a quick moment.

I said that it was what the song said, and Maria said her usual thing about being aware of agendas in media, and that everyone has their agendas about the death of Queen Elizabeth.

Instantly both my Dad and Maria were shocked so I repeated \"I cannot imagine how miserable you must be because you can't enjoy anything on account of 'agendae' being everywhere.\" Maria got flustered and walked out.
