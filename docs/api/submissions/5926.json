Me and my husband's divorce just got finalized last month and it's honestly a different type of pain, but I thankfully have wonderful friends and family who've been supporting me all the way.\n\nWe had Christmas dinner with family. A lot of my relatives kept checking in with me, asking if I was doing okay and bringing me food. I felt really loved and it was pretty fun overall, and took my mind off everything for a bit.\n\nMy cousin A's fiance recently passed. She was at dinner, but wasn't talking much and mostly kept to herself. I saw her getting soda, so I asked if she could bring me one as well.\n\nThat didn't go well. A got upset and started going off at me, why she should have to bring me things and I can get my own. I told her it's completely fine if she doesn't, I just asked since she was already there and she's making a big deal.\n\nA looked like she was about to cry, and kept going off about how I expected everyone to \"fawn\" over me and no one cares about her and her fiance.\n\nI told A we're all doing our best. I'm sorry if she feels that way but this isn't a grief competition, and she should understand that.\n\nA few people overheard us, but the conversation changed and it wasn't a huge issue. A's sister messaged me later that what I said to A is \"awful\" and we're all awful to her.\n\nI told my best friend what happened and she suggested I post on here for opinions.

I'm very close to my mom but she was in a different city at the time, so I called my aunt to come visit. She stayed with me instead of going to the funeral, and A sent some not so nice texts to me later.\n\nYou called her mother away from her **fiance's funeral**; of course she was upset with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>... even at Christmas dinner when everyone was chatting and talking, she wasn't joining in\n\n**Her fiance just died.** And your relatives were all hovering around you, because of a year old event. Grief is not a competition, but some is fresher than other.\n\n>it's not a competition to see who has it worse, and A is still very young (21), beautiful and smart, so it's not the end of the world for her (vs the pain of losing a child and having your relationship break down over it).\n\nSo, grief is not a competition, but your year old loss is much more serious than her fiance's recent death. Right. I'm beginning to wonder if her being beautiful and smart is the reason you are just a beast about her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I know a couple of people that overheard our conversation tried to gently explain that to her, but she ended up leaving earlier.\n\nYour whole family sucks and I hope she reaches out to her late (you know, the one that died **recently**) fiance's family for love and support, because she certainly is not going to get any from a family that dances attendance on the best manipulator.\n\nEdited to correct autocorrect because I don't have accent marks.", "YTA, in your comments you state that you also had your Aunt, A's MOM, skip the fiance's funeral to be with you. A probably needed so much support that day and you considered your needs above hers so I imagine that your \"this isn't a grief competition\" comment was excruciating for her. It apparently was in your family and you won. Congratulations. Every interaction following the funeral is going to be colored by that. People were doting on you all night and it sounds like they were doing nothing for A which had to sting. Have a little self awareness about that. You sound as if you want to benefit from having love and support but want to give none of it back.", "YTA\u2014 It seems like everyone failed to read A and ignored her. People were fawning over you while she was by herself, so she was seething over that who knows how long, and then annoyed to see you getting offered everything when she had to get up to get her own drink so she saw asking her to get the soda as asking her the join the people serving you. \nYour \u201cit\u2019s not a competition\u201d comment wasn\u2019t the right thing to say. The family failed to give her the comfort she wanted\u2014 she did lose the competition for attention. \nI think instead of asking if A is an AH everyone should have asked how they can help her before she screamed.", "YTA after reading your comments\u2026wow do you even have a heart?", "YTA.\nAnyone who says you\u2019re not hasn\u2019t seen your comment where you decided to air how you really feel about her loss. \nApparently OP feels that it isn\u2019t the end of the world for her cousin because \u201cshe\u2019s young\u201d and proceeds to subtly hint that it is indeed a grief competition and she feels she has it worse. \n\n\nI almost felt like you werent a massive ah when reading the actual post but now it just seems like you\u2019re a gross person.", "YTA.  You think because she is young and pretty,  the loss of her fiance doesn't hurt her as bad.  She can get over it. And you convinced her mom not to go to your cousins fianc\u00e9 funeral.

Did you check in on her?~~\n\nYTA \n\nRead some of your comments. You're the asshole here. I'm sorry you've had a really rough time lately. However, you're downplaying A's own pain. \n\nYou caused her mother to miss part of the funeral. Her fianc\u00e9 just died. She needed her mother, but you decided you needed your aunt more. \n\nAlso, it doesn't matter if A is still young. She may have plenty of time to fall in love again. But she just lost the person she thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with. Her heart is shattered right now. \n\nLike you said, it's not a competition. So stop trying to win the misery Olympics here. It's not going to hurt to to actually show A some real compassion instead if making yourself the ultimate victim in the family.", "The way you're responding to people taking you to task here... holy crap OP, it's giving me the feeling that it wasn't just the miscarriage that made your husband divorce you. \n\nYou had a panic attack and instead of calling a friend, you called A's mom AT THE FUNERAL, and had her leave early to be with you.\n\nYou passed off A's trauma by saying she is still young so she can find someone new, and how she doesn't understand loss cuz she lost 1 and you lost 2.\n\nThen proceeded to try and gaslight her into feeling bad for going off on you, when she was also suffering. You say you don't want a contest of who had it worse. Your replies prove otherwise.\n\nTldr, YTA.", "Sorry for the miscarriage and divorce but the human dying is worse.

I'm guessing your cousin kept to herself because she was mourning her fiance without any support from her family.", "Yes, YTA. It\u2019s not a grief competition you say,\nbut you were happy to sop up all the attention while your grieving cousin got none of the same support.", "YTA\n\nThis is based on what OP put in the comments.\n\nShame on you for making you the focus of attention on the day your cousin was burying her fianc\u00e9.  Double shame on your aunt for not supporting her daughter over you.\n\nIf the above isn\u2019t bad enough, your comment \u201cI completely get she's hurt and upset, and was going off at me out of grief.

Do you know how messed up that even sounds?  \n\nYour young cousin was looking forward to spending her life with her special partner. To possibly raising a family together. So many hopes and dreams. She needs a lot of love,  support and TLC.\n\nYou and your aunt are just heartless.", "You're right.  It's not a grief competition.  So don't compete.  You can offer compassion and grace as well as receive it.\n\nI'm so sorry for your losses.  I hope you feel the same about your cousin's loss.  I'm in N A H territory because this is a horrible situation for both you and your cousin.  Invite her over for tea, have a good cry together, and help support each other.\n\nETA: Further context reveals OP had her cousin's mother miss the fiance's funeral. Changing N A H to YTA.", "YTA - As you know, grieving a loss is hard. You've made it worse. You had a miscarriage last year she recently lost the love of her life. The person she was probably with most of her time. Think for just a second about someone other than yourself because clearly your family isn't thinking of anyone but you. \n\nIt's not your fault they are fawning over you, but then you lead by example and bring her into the fold. The fact you said this isn't a grief competition is honestly disgusting. She was asking for help, and you just invalidated her. If you were my cousin, I'd never speak to you again.\n\nEdit: After seeing some of your comments OP, you are encouraging people to ignore your cousin. You called HER MUM away from her daughters fianc\u00e9's funeral cause you had a panic attack. Here is a little bit of advice - when my dad died, my mum was in hospital and barely knew what day of the week it was, dying herself. When she got out, I put my grief on hold to support her. When my dad died, my BEST FRIEND (who is like a sister to me) had JUST had a miscarriage a few months prior. My best friend didn't tell me that it wasn't a grief competition, no. She supported me during a rough time.", "Omg YTA. What an insensitive thing to say to someone who's partner just died.\n\nClearly you're the favorite in the family. You may not see it that way but my goodness, it's clear your cousin is struggling.\n\nOffer her some of the love and support you have expressed gratitude for. Pay it forward.", "Wow, looks like A is the only one without TA gene", "OP please send A this thread so she can know that y\u2019all\u2019s behavior was not ok. It\u2019s the least you can do at this point. \n\nI am so sorry that you suffered a miscarriage. I can\u2019t imagine the emotional pain that came with that traumatic event ending your marriage. \n\nBut if it wasn\u2019t a grief contest, how could you make the day of A\u2019s fianc\u00e9s funeral about yourself? This poor girl lost her love and you took away her mother\u2019s chance to support her on the day she needed her most.

You told her that she should be ok because she is young and beautiful and you made her mom MISS the fiance's funeral? How would you feel if someone told you 'oh, you still have uterus and there are plenty of men out there, don't be sad?'.\nBut your family is also horrible (having favourites it's awful) and I get where you learnt to behave like that.", "You were completely dishonest about how you framed this OP. This has nothing to do with asking for a soda. You legit **are** comparing the grief, because you said so in your comments.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t give a shit about your panic attack, because you expected that panic attack to make it somehow ok that you called your aunt while she was at her daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s funeral and expected her to leave. Which she did. Which blows my mind that you don\u2019t see how crazy inappropriate you both were in that moment. You say you have \u2018wonderful friends who\u2019ve been supporting you\u2019 so you should have called THEM, and not your aunt.\n\nYTA. Your aunt is a massive one as well.\n\nQuoting just to show people who don\u2019t bother with the sub comments.

However this sounds like a cry for some love and support from someone who is struggling and feeling detached. And instead of showing compassion you made a comment that invalidated the depth of their grief. YTA (softly) because you didnt recognise that whilst it isnt a competition, A was acutely suffering. It might be just how youve written it, but it comes across quite self centred. A kept to themselves - obviously needed support and couldnt ask for it, and this soda was the straw that broke the camels back.", ">so I called my aunt to come visit. She stayed with me instead of going to the funeral\n\nYTA. Majorly. So is her mother. You make it out to be like A has no cause to be mad at you and that you're some poor victim, but you're not. You know why she's hurt. You know what you did to her on a day she needed her mother most. But you chose to be selfish.", "Read the comment and sounds like everyone but A sucks here.\n\nI get why she's pissed if her own mother didn't come to the funeral to support her daughter the day she was burying her fiance, but came to support you during your panic attack. \n\nAlso, for someone who says \"grief is not a competition\", you seem to think your grief is more important than her because she's younger. That's just a lot of BS.\n\nI'm going with ESH because you and some members of your family (apparently A's sister seems to be there for her sister) are the worst assholes ever.", "Besides the fact that both the post and your comments show you and your family to be the grossest, unwashed YTA imaginable it's a special kind of entitlement to ask your aunt to come to you for a panic attack instead of supporting her. If she wasn't your direct neighbour the panic attack most likely was over before she arrived. If you were still able to call your aunt the panic attack was by no means bad enough to make a decent person think even during the worst of it it's worth taking away your cousin's support during any funeral, let alone that of her fiance.\n\nI have panic attacks from CPTSD. During the worst I need to focus to be able to breath. My record amount of panic attacks in a day was in the two digits. I slept through most of the second Christmas day when I had a friend over because I was so exhausted from all the panic attacks. I had such bad ones I put myself into a psychiatric hospital. Panic attacks suck. A lot. They're horrible. But they're not as horrible as being deserted by your own mother on the funeral of your life partner and even during my worst times I'd never even think of taking away that support. Not even from my worst enemy.", "YTA \n\nIt WAS the end of her world. It's a fucking HUGE deal. You can't just say \"I had a miscarriage\" and everything you do is ok after that! That is just gross! Miscarriages are very hard. I have been through 6 myself, but I NEVER would have treated someone this way! I was passing what was left of my little girl at my brother's funeral, and I still had time to be compassionate to my best friend who was sad because her grandad was moving. It sounds like you can't handle the guilt of not being there for her so now you gotta say something shitty so you don't have to look at her and remember how much of a trash human you are", "YTA and this is coming from a mother who lost her son at 5 MONTHS OLD. I had a living breathing child who I had done everything for for 5 months and woke up one day and he was gone. I was his only parent but do you know what I didn\u2019t do? Get mad when people comforted my mom more than they did me. Grief isn\u2019t a competition. It isn\u2019t a contest, she lost the person she was supposed to spend the rest of her life with and you took her mother away at his funeral when she needed her mothers support and strength. You\u2019re the one who made this a competition of grief. She just put her (rightful) anger at you after spending the whole Christmas watching everyone comfort you and not one person comfort her. I get you\u2019re grieving but you behavior towards her is disgusting", "YTA. It sounds like your cousin was upset that everyone in the family seemed to be focused on you even though she needs just as much support or more because her fiance just recently died and then when she got up to get herself a drink, most likely to take a break from all the people fawning over you while they ignored her (which would be extremely hurtful to almost anyone and it\u2019s surprising that this has to be pointed out), you asked her to also get you a drink. Even if she was just getting herself a drink and wasn\u2019t upset about the family favoring you, that would\u2019ve been highly insensitive anyways as she is grieving a very fresh death of a loved one.", "You got broken up, she lost her fiance.

Every comment shows that you lack basic empathy and make everything about you. \n\nA panic attack and divorce paperwork doesn\u2019t compare to the funeral of her fianc\u00e9.

It should have been more than obvious that she needed the same care and attention that was being given to you - before she had her outburst.\n\nTo become defensive about her outburst rather than reacting with compassion and support is a pretty bad look for your entire family and you in particular.

Me and my husband's divorce just got finalized last month and it's honestly a different type of pain, but I thankfully have wonderful friends and family who've been supporting me all the way.\n\nWe had Christmas dinner with family. A lot of my relatives kept checking in with me, asking if I was doing okay and bringing me food. I felt really loved and it was pretty fun overall, and took my mind off everything for a bit. \n\nMy cousin A was also there, but she wasn't talking much and mostly kept to herself. I saw her getting soda, so I asked if she could bring me one as well.\n\nThat didn't go well. A got upset and started going off at me, why she should have to bring me things and I can get my own. I told her it's completely fine if she doesn't, I just asked since she was already there and she's making a big deal. \n\nA looked like she was about to cry, and kept going off about how I expected everyone to \"fawn\" over me and no one cares about her and her fiance. \n\nI told A we're all doing our best. I'm sorry if she feels that way but this isn't a grief competition, and she should understand that.\n\nA few people overheard us, but the conversation changed and it wasn't a huge issue. A's sister messaged me later that what I said to A is \"awful\" and we're all awful to her. \n\nI told my best friend what happened and she suggested I post on here for opinions. I didn't think this was such a big deal, but A thought otherwise. Was I the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She lost her fianc\u00e9 the person she wanted to spend her life with. She\u2019s 21 for gods sake and her whole family seem to care more about her cousins year old trauma than her recent one. There is no way you didn\u2019t know it was the funeral when you called your aunt and I bet it was a one up on the cousin for her to show that she is the most important in the family. Why not call a friend, a family member not at the funeral, another family member who was at the funeral like a cousin or grandparent. You don\u2019t call the mother of the girl who just lost her fianc\u00e9 and get her to come to you. As for you saying that her loss doesn\u2019t matter as much because she is young and has time to find someone else. That is such a vile thing to say to someone who just lost someone they love. So then by your logic your grief doesn\u2019t matter because you can find someone else to marry and have a kid with or find a way to have a kid on your own. \n\nYou post and comments lack empathy and self awareness. How selfish can one person be well turns out pretty damn selfish and self involved. \n\nNo matter what your family tell you the whole world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and other people have feelings as well that matter just as much as yours.

You got divorced because of a miscarriage? Miscarriages are insanely common. Something like 10% to 20% of KNOWN pregnancies end in miscarriage. A lot more unknown pregnancies end is miscarriage because the would be mother miscarries before they even know they are pregnant. Divorce is even more common, about 50% of marriages end in divorce. Neither is a big deal.\n\nThat's not to say you shouldn't grieve over a miscarriage and divorce can be hard but your fiance dying is a much much much bigger deal.\n\n> As I said, it's not a competition to see who has it worse, and A is still very young (21), beautiful and smart, so it's not the end of the world for her (vs the pain of losing a child and having your relationship break down over it).\n\n\"A\" has it worse and it's not even close. I don't know how old you are but the same can be said for you. My wife miscarried her first pregnancy but then we had 2 kids, one at age 38 and the other at 41 so you have plenty of time. \"A\" didn't get a chance to even get married to try to have kids.\n\n>  I'm close to my aunt (A's mom) and I had a sudden panic attack one day.

She stayed with me instead of going to the funeral.\n\nYou sound like a nightmare and your family must hate \"A\" because I cannot fathom a world in which I leave my child's fiance's funeral to go comfort my niece instead of my child. Sounds like your panic attack was because \"A\" was getting all the attention and you had to make it about yourself. I would NEVER EVER consider calling my aunt to even ask knowing she was at a funeral.

I'm sorry if she feels that way but this isn't a grief competition, and she should understand that.\n\nIn theory, I completely agree with you that grief isn't a competition. What concerns me is how you used this logic to ignore your cousin's needs. If you understand the depths and magnitude of loss in the ways such a statement would claim, what kind of response would you have wanted in that moment? You were being pampered and felt loved, which helped take your mind off the pain you were experiencing. Your cousin's pain is much fresher than yours, not better, not more authentic -- but she's just lost the person she was choosing to marry. She lost her partner, her friend, and her hopes and dreams for the foreseeable future. Just as you did in a different way.  Why was your impulse to push her away when she couldn't be useful to you, versus rise and put your arms around her or sit with her and offer her some of the attention you still craved and benefited from? Why couldn't you show her the ropes of grief instead of stealthily shame her for taking the spotlight off you and your loss? \n\nNot sure how to pass judgement. I don't think you hurt your cousin intentionally, but your insensitivity to them feels larger than just this moment. Maybe it's unfair to call it insensitivity. I've experienced acute loss and grief and sometimes there just isn't enough emotional bandwidth to do more than breathe. You just maybe don't have it in you to give, and that's part of loss too. But are you the kind of person that sucks all of the oxygen out of the room when you're around, loss or not? Is your cousin the silent suffering type? Have you two had a life long competition going for family attention? It's confusing to me that your aunt, your cousin's mom, would leave her fiance's funeral to come and console you. Didn't she also need consolation? She left the funeral to come to you. Does that make it better for you,that she came when you called, leaving her own child without her mom while she's burying her dead beloved? Couldn't you have called someone else in that moment for support or was she truly your only option? Why didn't your aunt have better boundaries or was this the only way she could think to respond? It clearly upset your cousin so the loss of her mom's physical support in that moment was detrimental to her. It's also confusing to me that you weren't at the funeral. It seems to me that in some ways it seems that  your grief dominates your family dynamics to the exclusion of your cousin. And you're both acting out painful relational dynamics in some immature ways versus talking directly about your issues -- which, now probably isn't the best time because you're both suffering a lot. \n\nAll of this to say -- both of you are grieving life changing losses. But your issues here go far beyond this moment. Your relationship is a tangled knot of missed opportunities, real or perceived slights, and a fight for a place at the family table. Your cousin needs to learn to speak up for herself in healthier ways. Or maybe she needs to face some uncomfortable truths about the family she's part of and find the support she needs elsewhere.", "YTA and so is the rest of your family.  You showed zero empathy for your cousin's very fresh grief and instead chose to wallow in your year old grief.   I have had 7 miscarriages (one at 6 months) I also lost a husband to suicide.

She's incredibly young, which makes it worse, because he probably was too.", ">and how she doesn't understand loss cuz she lost 1 and you lost 2.\n\nComparing a divorce to a literal death is just wrong.

Hard YTA, oh my goodness.", "based on comments quoted by other users, Cousin's fianc\u00e9's funeral was very recent.  \n\nAs I understand it the timeline - miscarriage sometime in 2021, divorce proceedings following, OP had a panic attack while doing admin regarding the divorce proceedings DURING the funeral (didn't attend the funeral to do paperwork) and called Aunt (mother of Cousin whose fianc\u00e9 was being BURIED) and somehow convinced Aunt to bail on the funeral of her DAUGHTER'S FUTURE HUSBAND, to come and offer ~~love and support~~  attention to OP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is not just YTA, but evil as well.", "I feel so bad for A. :(", "I was honestly expecting to read this in the post.  \n\nBeing a widow is weird, and it always surprises me the way other people frame the loss of a partner. In my experience, there is this cruel, unspoken hierarchy of who gets to have the more legitimate grief.  \n\nI think that and the number of people who ghost you like widowhood is contagious was the hardest outside part.", "The best reply to this was in the Anne of green gables series. When one of the characters is told her fiance died in the war, and someone says to her well you didn't lose a husband or a son, and she replys; \"no, I've only lost the man that would have been my husband and the sons and daughters that might have been born to me\", it's always stuck with me.", "They are, everytime I'm tempted to look on them with disfavour (as the world teaches us) I remind myself how much of a privilege it is to get them.\n\nI wish you many wrinkles in your future.\n\nAnd if you're crafty and kind, you'll love forum.lettucecraft.com", "Why wasn't OP offering to get HER a drink instead? You know, like doing these small things that everyone else is doing for her bc of her loss?

Miscarriages are exceedingly common- at LEAST 1 out of 4 pregnancies end in miscarriage. It's just a part of life. It's hard, it's emotional, but, like.. it's not like losing your fiance.

NOTHING.", "And WHY wasn\u2019t OP at her cousins fianc\u00e9s FUNERAL to begin with!?! Cause it wasn\u2019t about her?", "I miscarried a bit later on but still earlyish.  I cried like 5 crocodile tears because I'm older and it was my first pregnancy.  Then I went to Panera for lunch and got a manicure.  Maybe its my Gran's British sensibility, but why drag on with it?\n\nWhy people need to griefwhore themselves I will never understand.  Get a hobby Jeeez", "I'm so sorry you lost someone you love. Unfortunately,  most women think the widow just became the new single, vulnerable woman that every man wants to take advantage of.  And that's so sad that you not only lose your partner,  but also some people that you thought they were friends.  \nBut let me tell you something,  sometimes we just don't know what to say, we are afraid to reopen the wound,  to say something inappropriate.  I felt like that when we lost a nephew, thinking how am I going to go through this,  and then thinking \" how are they going to go through this? \" if as an aunt I felt so much pain but so much emptiness,  how the heck are they dealing day to day?? \" \n\nSo my respect  and admiration to you and your strength to live.", "I think the cousin was trying to step away and compose herself but OP couldn't have that happen. So she asked her to get one for her.  She was looking for an excuse to say something to her.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I lost my hubby when he was 41 so intimately know what you\u2019re going through. All the life milestones we won\u2019t get to have together, him not being here to see his incredible kids grow up, and them not having him here to support them as they navigate life. It\u2019s unfair. Sending you and your family love, strength and support. Please do message me if you\u2019d like to chat. \nPs I know it\u2019s early so this might not be useful right now, but I found Nora McInerny\u2019s podcast and books helpful when I was ready.", "It's ok to say that you don't know what to say or you don't know how to help. One of the most comforting things I was told after my husband died was \"words and shit...\" Which seemed odd until she explained that she didn't know which ones would hurt or help so she was giving them all to me so I could pick out the right ones.  \n\nAnd it isn't just women. I've also had to explain to men that he isn't my *ex*-husband... Because he's still my husband. That won't ever change. Even getting remarried won't change the fact that he's still my husband. And the thought of all that shit and more for a fiance or otherwise non-married commitment couple... To hear things about not being the person's spouse and having absolutely none of the legal rights and protections. That shit breaks my heart.", "Thank you for your kind words", "She didn\u2019t lose a child.  She had a miscarriage.  After watching the same person go through both these things, I can very confidently say that they aren\u2019t the same, and that losing an actual child is worse.", "Most 21 year old have not lost a fiance to death, or known anyone that did. A is very much an outlier. She lost he fiance, and likely her in laws, suddenly, and there is no one that she knows that can relate. OP experienced a miscarriage (1 in 4 pregnancies result in loss) and got divorced (rates vary, but up to 50% of marriages end in divorce), so OP likely knows other people that can relate to her experiences. If there was such a thing as grief Olympics, OP is not the gold medal winner right now.", "I lost mine last year and I don't think I will ever be over it. I've also had a miscarriage. It doesn't even begin to compare.", "This. I\u2019m trying help his very young adult kids through this. He did have a grandson two years ago, so at least he got that. There were some serious issues when they were teens that the youngest was just starting to forgive him for and was relying on him more. It made him so happy anytime they came to him with their problems because there was a time they wouldn\u2019t have. I hate that they will never have that fully healed. I lost my mom when I was 21 and it was so hard.", "Finally someone said it. A miscarriage is traumatic but it\u2019s not the loss of a person you knew, loved and had planned to build a life with. The loss of your future.", "I know every loss is different but I\u2019ve had two, every married woman I can remember talking about it with has had a miscarriage. It\u2019s sad and I know it\u2019s a real strain in marriages when the woman feels an intense loss and the man doesn\u2019t. And I\u2019ve been through a divorce and it broke my heart and even ten years later it stings. But I can\u2019t compare those losses to a person whose child or fianc\u00e9 died.", "And why wasnt OP at the funeral anyways? Her cousins fiance passed away.", "Not grief exactly, but maybe anagolous. I have chronic pain and early on my friends would sort of police their pain and make comments like \"well it's nothing compared to what you deal with.\" I shut that down. Pain is pain. Just because I might have more of it doesn't make anyone else's invalid. They are still in pain and are allowed to express that. We can all feel validated even with varying degrees, and when we're talking about your pain I am not constantly bringing up mine.\n\nSo yeah it's not a competition, but more in the \"I refuse to compete with you\" way, not the \"You don't get to have feelings\" way that OP is going for.", "Ya she is way too self involved to ever have a functional, healthy relationship. Her husband made the right move by divorce, and I don\u2019t usually say that. \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine having everyone hover over me and cater to me like that. It would be incredibly uncomfortable and I\u2019d be telling people I was fine and I didn\u2019t need everything even if that wasn\u2019t completely true. I also can\u2019t find imagine purposely making myself the center of attention by not having my shit together as dramatically as possible.", "OP was thirsty in more than one way! Desperate for attention so I\u2019m wondering how she\u2019s liking the attention this post got her!", "I'm so sorry to hear this.  I'm glad you said what I was feeling though.  I likewise lost my significant other.  We were together for 8 years, I was 27 when he died.  He also died suddenly.  To me it hurt so much more than our miscarriage did.  It was soul crushing to hear that whole \"oh you can still find somebody else,\" charade.  It's been years since then.  It still hurts, but I've learned to be happy again.  I hope you can find peace.", "When I lost my fianc\u00e9 to suicide, I was alone in another state and begged family and friends to be with me so I wouldn\u2019t be alone in that house. My BEST FRIEND justified being unable to come by saying we hadn\u2019t been together long (3 years) and to treat it like a bad breakup to get over it quick. That I was young and would meet someone else. \n\nWe didn\u2019t break up. He was in pain and ended his life. And I found him like that. \n\nHer callousness ended our friendship and has forever made me wary of new friends.", "I\u2019m thinking that even if the OP doesn\u2019t know it consciously, her panic attack on the day of her cousin fiance\u2019s funeral was likely intentional - she didn\u2019t want the attention of the family to shift from her to her cousin. YTA OP, you talk about how your family\u2019s support helped you through your grief, but it seems like you are intentionally sabotaging your family\u2019s ability to do the same for your cosin.", "Well on that note, OP lost a pregnancy not a baby. And her husband isn\u2019t lost just didn\u2019t want to be with her. For someone saying it\u2019s not a grief competition OP sure is trying to be the winner.", "She def lost the grief competition on here! Prob the first time in her life & likely driving her nuts! U gotta be twisted person to put those 2 words together", " Exactly. It doesn't lessen the grief, but we've all seen people get divorced and live to tell the tale. Miscarriage isn't talked about openly in the same way, but so many people have experienced at least one that OP at least has the option of reaching out to a support group. \n\nFunctionally widowed at 21? No matter how much other people's hearts ache for you, there just aren't many other folk in the same boat who know exactly what it feels like. I can't begin to imagine the loneliness of that thought.", "My love passed May 20th of this year to cancer. I knew the end was closer than we hoped, but I held out hope for longer. Like you, we weren't engaged yet, but I found out from his father and daughter he bought a ring (they refuse to let me see it as they didn't agree with him buying it). It's not just about losing the love, it's losing everything that went with it. He and I were friends for about 16yrs before taking the leap of a relationship. I replay so much in my head, and the what-ifs are devastating. OP doesn't care to understand her cousins pain, because it would mean the attention would be off of her.", "yeah", "I\u2019m sorry that you lost your mum so young too, life can be so shit. I\u2019m sure your step kids are so grateful to have you supporting them through. X", "I\u2019ve been pregnant 9 times. I have 2 children. I have been divorced. I was then widowed when my 2nd husband died age 36. \n\nThe pain from each of those losses stays but becoming a widow was by far and away the one that tore my very soul apart. I know others will have also experienced all 3 types of loss and feel differently about how each one effected them. And that\u2019s as it should be. The very idea that OP should feel justified in dismissing and demeaning her cousins grief because she is also grieving is about as repugnant as it looks. \n\nSpeaking for myself, I would feel ashamed - using the grief of miscarriage to dismiss the bereavement of a life partner/spouse. My children, even the ones that didn\u2019t make it, deserve more than being played as pawns in a twisted ego driven game of emotional manipulation. I would feel disgusted with myself. \n\nBut that\u2019s me. If you\u2019re ok with what you\u2019ve done - well it\u2019s not like anyone else matters is it? I mean, if other people, their pain and your bereavement are just fodder for bickering and internet points then more power to you I guess. \n\nDo I really need to write YTA?", "That was what I was thinking too after my initial shock of blaming OP for making the aunt come over. But then the more I thought about it, I was flabbergasted a mother wouldn\u2019t be there for her daughter on what was probably the most difficult day of A\u2019s life. The whole family is bizarre.", "Hey, thanks so much for saying this. I lost my 17 year old dog who I grew up with a month ago and its been hell. I get by most days but I feel his absence so strongly I have to actively pretend he's just roaming around the house somewhere and not in my room with me to cope. \n\nEveryone keeps saying to get a new dog but....they just dont get it. My dog was a whole person with his own personality and attitude. I *cannot* just go out and get another dog. I don't know how to explain it, he wasn't just a dog-- he was my brother too.", "YUP.  She wanted to make sure that cousin was fussing over her like everyone else was..."]}
