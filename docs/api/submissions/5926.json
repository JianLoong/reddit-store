I felt really loved and it was pretty fun overall, and took my mind off everything for a bit.\n\nMy cousin A's fiance recently passed. She was at dinner, but wasn't talking much and mostly kept to herself. I saw her getting soda, so I asked if she could bring me one as well.\n\nThat didn't go well. A got upset and started going off at me, why she should have to bring me things and I can get my own. I told her it's completely fine if she doesn't, I just asked since she was already there and she's making a big deal.\n\nA looked like she was about to cry, and kept going off about how I expected everyone to \"fawn\" over me and no one cares about her and her fiance.\n\nI told A we're all doing our best. I'm sorry if she feels that way but this isn't a grief competition, and she should understand that.\n\nA few people overheard us, but the conversation changed and it wasn't a huge issue. A's sister messaged me later that what I said to A is \"awful\" and we're all awful to her.\n\nI told my best friend what happened and she suggested I post on here for opinions.

I'm very close to my mom but she was in a different city at the time, so I called my aunt to come visit. She stayed with me instead of going to the funeral, and A sent some not so nice texts to me later. \n\nYou called her mother away from her **finance's funeral**; of course she was upset with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>... even at Christmas dinner when everyone was chatting and talking, she wasn't joining in\n\n**Her finance just died.** And your relatives were all hovering around you, because of a year old event. Grief is not a competition, but some is fresher than other.\n\n \n\n>it's not a competition to see who has it worse, and A is still very young (21), beautiful and smart, so it's not the end of the world for her (vs the pain of losing a child and having your relationship break down over it). \n\nSo, grief is not a competition, but your year old loss is much more serious than her finance's recent death. Right. I'm beginning to wonder if her being beautiful and smart is the reason you are just a beast about her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I know a couple of people that overheard our conversation tried to gently explain that to her, but she ended up leaving earlier.\n\nYour whole family sucks and I hope she reaches out to her late (you know, the one that died **recently**) finance's family for love and support, because she certainly is not going to get any from a family that dances attendance on the best manipulator.", "YTA, in your comments you state that you also had your Aunt, A's MOM, skip the fiance's funeral to be with you. A probably needed so much support that day and you considered your needs above hers so I imagine that your \"this isn't a grief competition\" comment was excruciating for her. It apparently was in your family and you won. Congratulations. Every interaction following the funeral is going to be colored by that. People were doting on you all night and it sounds like they were doing nothing for A which had to sting. Have a little self awareness about that. You sound as if you want to benefit from having love and support but want to give none of it back.", "YTA\u2014 It seems like everyone failed to read A and ignored her. People were fawning over you while she was by herself, so she was seething over that who knows how long, and then annoyed to see you getting offered everything when she had to get up to get her own drink so she saw asking her to get the soda as asking her the join the people serving you. \nYour \u201cit\u2019s not a competition\u201d comment wasn\u2019t the right thing to say. The family failed to give her the comfort she wanted\u2014 she did lose the competition for attention. \nI think instead of asking if A is an AH everyone should have asked how they can help her before she screamed.", "YTA after reading your comments\u2026wow do you even have a heart?", "YTA.\nAnyone who says you\u2019re not hasn\u2019t seen your comment where you decided to air how you really feel about her loss. \nApparently OP feels that it isn\u2019t the end of the world for her cousin because \u201cshe\u2019s young\u201d and proceeds to subtly hint that it is indeed a grief competition and she feels she has it worse. \n\n\nI almost felt like you werent a massive ah when reading the actual post but now it just seems like you\u2019re a gross person.", "YTA.  You think because she is young and pretty,  the loss of her fiance doesn't hurt her as bad.  She can get over it. And you convinced her mom not to go to your cousins fianc\u00e9 funeral.

Did you check in on her?~~\n\nYTA \n\nRead some of your comments. You're the asshole here. I'm sorry you've had a really rough time lately. However, you're downplaying A's own pain. \n\nYou caused her mother to miss part of the funeral. Her fianc\u00e9 just died. She needed her mother, but you decided you needed your aunt more. \n\nAlso, it doesn't matter if A is still young. She may have plenty of time to fall in love again. But she just lost the person she thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with. Her heart is shattered right now. \n\nLike you said, it's not a competition.

I'm guessing your cousin kept to herself because she was mourning her fiance without any support from her family.", "Yes, YTA. It\u2019s not a grief competition you say,\nbut you were happy to sop up all the attention while your grieving cousin got none of the same support.", "YTA\n\nThis is based on what OP put in the comments.\n\nShame on you for making you the focus of attention on the day your cousin was burying her fianc\u00e9.

Do you know how messed up that even sounds?  \n\nYour young cousin was looking forward to spending her life with her special partner. To possibly raising a family together. So many hopes and dreams. She needs a lot of love,  support and TLC.\n\nYou and your aunt are just heartless.", "You're right.  It's not a grief competition.  So don't compete.  You can offer compassion and grace as well as receive it.\n\nI'm so sorry for your losses.  I hope you feel the same about your cousin's loss.  I'm in NAH territory because this is a horrible situation for both you and your cousin.  Invite her over for tea, have a good cry together, and help support each other.\n\nETA: Further context reveals OP had her cousin's mother miss the fiance's funeral. Changing NAH to YTA.", "YTA - As you know grieving a loss is hard. You've made it worse. You had a miscarriage last year she recently lost the love of her life. The person she was probably with most of her time. Think for just a second about someone other than yourself because clearly your family aren't thinking of anyone but you. \n\nIt's not your fault they are fawning over you but then you lead by example and bring her into the fold. The fact you said this isn't a grief competition is honestly disgusting. She was asking for help and you just invalidated her. If you were my cousin I'd never speak to you again.", "Omg YTA. What an insensitive thing to say to someone who's partner just died.\n\nClearly you're the favorite in the family. You may not see it that way but my goodness, it's clear your cousin is struggling.\n\nOffer her some of the love and support you have expressed gratitude for.

I can\u2019t imagine the emotional pain that came with that traumatic event ending your marriage. \n\nBut if it wasn\u2019t a grief contest, how could you make the day of A\u2019s fianc\u00e9s funeral about yourself? This poor girl lost her love and you took away her mother\u2019s chance to support her on the day she needed her most.

You told her that she should be ok because she is young and beautiful and you made her mom MISS the fiance's funeral? How would you feel if someone told you 'oh, you still have uterus and there are plenty of men out there, don't be sad?'.\nBut your family is also horrible (having favourites it's awful) and I get where you learnt to behave like that.", "You were completely dishonest about how you framed this OP. This has nothing to do with asking for a soda. You legit **are** comparing the grief, because you said so in your comments.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t give a shit about your panic attack, because you expected that panic attack to make it somehow ok that you called your aunt while she was at her daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s funeral and expected her to leave. Which she did. Which blows my mind that you don\u2019t see how crazy inappropriate you both were in that moment. You say you have \u2018wonderful friends who\u2019ve been supporting you\u2019 so you should have called THEM, and not your aunt.\n\nYTA. Your aunt is a massive one as well.\n\nQuoting just to show people who don\u2019t bother with the sub comments.

However this sounds like a cry for some love and support from someone who is struggling and feeling detached. And instead of showing compassion you made a comment that invalidated the depth of their grief. YTA (softly) because you didnt recognise that whilst it isnt a competition, A was acutely suffering. It might be just how youve written it, but it comes across quite self centred. A kept to themselves - obviously needed support and couldnt ask for it, and this soda was the straw that broke the camels back.", ">so I called my aunt to come visit. She stayed with me instead of going to the funeral\n\nYTA. Majorly. So is her mother. You make it out to be like A has no cause to be mad at you and that you're some poor victim, but you're not. You know why she's hurt. You know what you did to her on a day she needed her mother most. But you chose to be selfish.", "Read the comment and sounds like everyone but A sucks here.\n\nI get why she's pissed if her own mother didn't come to the funeral to support her daughter the day she was burying her fiance, but came to support you during your panic attack. \n\nAlso, for someone who says \"grief is not a competition\", you seem to think your grief is more important than her because she's younger. That's just a lot of BS.\n\nI'm going with ESH because you and some members of your family (apparently A's sister seems to be there for her sister) are the worst assholes ever.", "Besides the fact that both the post and your comments show you and your family to be the grossest, unwashed YTA imaginable it's a special kind of entitlement to ask her aunt to come to you for a panic attack instead of supporting her. If she wasn't your direct neighbour the panic attack most likely was over before she arrived. If you were still able to call your aunt the panic attack was by no means bad enough to make a decent person think even during the worst of it it's worth taking away your cousin's support during any funeral, let alone that of her fiance.\n\nI panic attacks from CPTSD. During the worst I need to focus to be able to breath. My record amount of panic attacks in a day was in the two digits. I slept through most of the second Christmas day when I had a friend over because I was so exhausted from all the panic attacks. I had such bad ones I put myself into a psychiatric hospital. Panic attacks suck. A lot. They're horrible. But they're not as horrible as being deserted by your own mother on the funeral of your life partner and even during my worst times I'd never even think of taking away that support. Not even from my worst enemy.", "YTA \n\nIt WAS the end of her world. It's a fucking HUGE deal. You can't just say \"I had a miscarriage\" and everything you do is ok after that! That is just gross! Miscarriages are very hard. I have been through 6 myself, but I NEVER would have treated someone this way! I was passing what was left of my little girl at my brother's funeral, and I still had time to be compassionate to my best friend who was sad because her grandad was moving. It sounds like you can't handle the guilt of not being there for her so now you gotta say something shitty so you don't have to look at her and remember how much of a trash human you are", "YTA and this is coming from a mother who lost her son at 5 MONTHS OLD. I had a living breathing child who I had done everything for for 5 months and woke up one day and he was gone. I was his only parent but do you know what I didn\u2019t do? Get mad when people comforted my mom more than they did me. Grief isn\u2019t a competition. It isn\u2019t a contest, she lost the person she was supposed to spend the rest of her life with and you took her mother away at his funeral when she needed her mothers support and strength. You\u2019re the one who made this a competition of grief. She just put her (rightful) anger at you after spending the whole Christmas watching everyone comfort you and not one person comfort her. I get you\u2019re grieving but you behavior towards her is disgusting", "YTA. It sounds like your cousin was upset that everyone in the family seemed to be focused on you even though she needs just as much support or more because her fiance just recently died and then when she got up to get herself a drink, most likely to take a break from all the people fawning over you while they ignored her (which would be extremely hurtful to almost anyone and it\u2019s surprising that this has to be pointed out), you asked her to also get you a drink. Even if she was just getting herself a drink and wasn\u2019t upset about the family favoring you, that would\u2019ve been highly insensitive anyways as she is grieving a very fresh death of a loved one.", "You got broken up, she lost her fiance.

Every comment shows that you lack basic empathy and make everything about you. \n\nA panic attack and divorce paperwork doesn\u2019t compare to the funeral of her fianc\u00e9.

You're making it a competition. You had a miscarriage \"last year\" (2021). Her fiance, a grown man, passed away \"recently\". I'm really interested to know when these events were.

I mean, it's so easy to do that, right? Why are you languishing a year later?\n\nYou clearly see your grief and sadness and more important. You clearly see this as a competition. And you're a gross and self-absorbed asshole. You called HER MOTHER during THE FUNERAL OF HER LIFE PARTNER and made her mom abandon her daughter to come and hold your widdle hand.\n\nIf your behavior towards other people is anything like your behavior towards A, I kinda doubt your husband left you over the miscarriage.

Also you literally asked HER mother, to leave the funeral and come comfort you instead. Like wtf! That\u2019s so awful! Don\u2019t you think on the day of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s funeral, that your cousin needed her mother more than you did? So yes you\u2019re the a**hole.", "Holy hell.

It should have been more than obvious that she needed the same care and attention that was being given to you - before she had her outburst.\n\nTo become defensive about her outburst rather than reacting with compassion and support is a pretty bad look for your entire family and you in particular.

Me and my husband's divorce just got finalized last month and it's honestly a different type of pain, but I thankfully have wonderful friends and family who've been supporting me all the way.\n\nWe had Christmas dinner with family. A lot of my relatives kept checking in with me, asking if I was doing okay and bringing me food. I felt really loved and it was pretty fun overall, and took my mind off everything for a bit. \n\nMy cousin A was also there, but she wasn't talking much and mostly kept to herself. I saw her getting soda, so I asked if she could bring me one as well.\n\nThat didn't go well. A got upset and started going off at me, why she should have to bring me things and I can get my own. I told her it's completely fine if she doesn't, I just asked since she was already there and she's making a big deal. \n\nA looked like she was about to cry, and kept going off about how I expected everyone to \"fawn\" over me and no one cares about her and her fiance. \n\nI told A we're all doing our best. I'm sorry if she feels that way but this isn't a grief competition, and she should understand that.\n\nA few people overheard us, but the conversation changed and it wasn't a huge issue. A's sister messaged me later that what I said to A is \"awful\" and we're all awful to her. \n\nI told my best friend what happened and she suggested I post on here for opinions. I didn't think this was such a big deal, but A thought otherwise. Was I the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And it is perfectly understandable that you would grieve the loss of your marriage as well. It\u2019s painful and it represents an end to the future you thought you would have with your spouse. \n\nBut divorce *isn\u2019t* a death. They are very different experiences and while both are painful, the tragic death of a loved one *is* more devastating than even the messiest of divorces. Your ex spouse is still alive.

Why do I have a feeling that OP is the spoiled golden child of the family and everything is all about her. I have a feeling the she is probably also way older than her cousin based on her cousin and never saying her own age. \n\nWhat you said to your cousin was absolutely disgusting. She lost her fianc\u00e9 the person she wanted to spend her life with. She\u2019s 21 for gods sake and her whole family seem to care more about her cousins year old trauma than her recent one. There is no way you didn\u2019t know it was the funeral when you called your aunt and I bet it was a one up on the cousin for her to show that she is the most important in the family. Why not call a friend, a family member not at the funeral, another family member who was at the funeral like a cousin or grandparent. You don\u2019t call the mother of the girl who just lost her fianc\u00e9 and get her to come to you. As for you saying that her loss doesn\u2019t matter as much because she is young and has time to find someone else. That is such a vile thing to say to someone who just lost someone they love. So then by your logic your grief doesn\u2019t matter because you can find someone else to marry and have a kid with or find a way to have a kid on your own. \n\nYou post and comments lack empathy and self awareness. How selfish can one person be well turns out pretty damn selfish and self involved. \n\nNo matter what your family tell you the whole world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and other people have feelings as well that matter just as much as yours. You don\u2019t hold the monopoly on pain or loss.

Geeez", "YTA\n\nYou ignored her and took all that attention all day when she lost her fianc\u00e9 recently?! \n\nIt\u2019s not a grief competition you\u2019re right, it\u2019s basic compassion for her grief you are 100% lacking and your followup and this pose cemented it twice imho \n\nGo apologize and give her the same care she obviously didn\u2019t get.
