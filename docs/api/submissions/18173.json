Could we maybe go to X instead?\"", "NAH\n\nWhere are all these NTAs coming from \u2014 how the hell is this dude the asshole?\n\nRather than *ask*, if that feels awkward, maybe *suggest* splitting the bill and going to another place?", "NTA\n\nJust be straight forward and honest with the dude and he\u2019ll honestly likely appreciate it. If it\u2019s an issue after the fact maybe even suggest a cheaper restaurant as well.

Due to car repairs I'm on a bit of a budget. Do you mind if we meet ___ instead?\" \n\nSend him a message quickly explaining your situation. It sounds like you are being financially responsible and that's always a good thing to see in a potential partner.\n\nGood luck with your first date.", "NTA- feel free to say, \"let's choose somewhere less expensive so we can split the bill.\"  He will understand what you mean or will understand with a little bit of explanation.  If he responds, \"that's OK, I will pay\" just say, \"Thank you, that's very sweet of you but I'd be more comfortable if we split it, at least for this first date.\"", "If you can\u2019t afford your half and don\u2019t want him to pay (which makes sense), I would explain and propose to go to a different restaurant or pick another activity.

I typically go by whoever asked for the date pays for the first one at least. But still there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking! There are some men that would get offended by you asking but those are rare and is a red flag to me", "Ask to instead go to someplace you can comfortably afford to pay your own way.\n\nLess than a meal is even better for a first in person date, say coffee or frozen yogurt, followed by a walk-and-talk in the park.

YWNBTA", "[deleted]", "INFO: he wants to go to a super-expensive restaurant for the FIRST date? First dates these days are something relatively cheap and non-obligating, like a cup of coffee or a drink, precisely so that people don't feel pressured to spend more than they have on what might not go anywhere.", "NTA - it's much better to get it out in the open and be honest than get into a potentially much more awkward situation later", "Not at all as long as you make it clear that his answer alone will not affect the outcome of the date. If not, he might think that this is some sort of test.", "NTA\n\nCommunication is a cornerstone of any healthy relationship. Start now.", "NTA. I personally would consider that great communication and take it as a good sign for a relationship.", "IMO, \"I want to take you out\" means that I am going to pay, whereas \"we\" suggestions: \"shall we get dinner\" etc. are open to splitting the check.\n\nBut you want certainty because you can't afford an expensive place. That's fine. Don't ask him how the check will be split - just tell him that that restaurant is out of your budget this month, because you just had some surprise car repairs. He'll either say \"OK., we can go somewhere cheaper\", which means you're splitting the check, or \"Don't worry about it - this is my treat\", which means he's paying.\n\nNAH", "NTA.

I don't think saying something like, \"hey, I'm really looking forward to going to restaurant with you, but I'd like to be able to pay for my fair share and due to some car repairs, I don't think I'll be able to right now. I don't want to ask you to pay for anything, but wanted to see if maybe we could go to blank because it'll be more in my budget? Maybe for our second date we can go to original expensive restaurant? What do you think?\"", "YWNBTA - But be abundantly clear. It's early on in talking to this dude so you have little knowledge on how he picks up hints and such, so to make sure you don't give off the wrong impression being very clear is needed. \"Hey so I looked at the restaurant and it looks nice, but I just put a new muffler on my car (or whatever lmao) and wouldn't be able to afford my half, I'm more than willing to pay my half on the first date, but can't do it at this spot currently :(((((\" \n\nBe up front about it basically, let there be no room for misinterpretation ya feel?", "NAH. Just be honest about the car repairs and suggest you go somewhere cheaper.", "You have a great attitude. Just explain that the place is out of your budget and ask to go somewhere else. I would advise to be clear with yourself on whether you feel comfortable when a man pays. Because be might respond that he would pay and you shouldn\u2019t worry. \n\nMy rule of the thumb is that I always insist on going somewhere where I can afford to pay for my own meal, because in certain cases on dates a man can pay and expect you to pay him back, if you get what I mean. Or simply I son\u2019t like the guy and do not want to make him feel used. Once I get to know the person I date I don\u2019t pay attention this much. \n\nGood luck and have fun! \n\nNTA", "Some people might perceive it as awkward but it's definitely a good move. Also obviously nta. I go about it by saying I can't afford that resurant, would you like to go somewhere else, and they will probably say that they have it covered. I'm a gay woman so assuming is even more up in the air. I either ask, or I make sure I have enough to pay for both of us.", "Nta, not at all, actually very considerate of you. This sub is filled with horror stories about people skipping out on checks or not bringing money because they assumed the other person was paying.", "NAH here, however regardless of who is paying, don't do dinner for a first date with someone you met online. It's too intense and if either of you are not feeling it, it's too long to commit too. Suggest meeting for a coffee or a drink instead, and keep dinner to the 2nd date. Really the first face to face meet is to see if you actually want to have a proper date.", "NAH but take the initiative and suggest something cheap or free for a first date activity. I've gone on walks, picnics, to free art galleries etc. It's easy to find tonnes of options and you can just tell him you're on a budget so would rather not go to a fancy restaurant right now", "NTA.\n\nJust say it like \"hey, I was wondering if we could pick a different restaurant because this one is out of my budget right now due to X. How about[alternative]?\"\n\nIf he expects you to pay anything he can agree to the alternative, no harm no foul. If he expects to pay, he can say \"oh I would never have asked you to pay\".\n\nYou're signaling that you plan to pay for yourself which a lot of guys WANT you to do, but they appreciate the opportunity to swoop in and be gallant and pay if they planned to. Win win really.", "Not at all. It shows initiave and having a straight forward personality. I love it!", "This is great because it makes clear that you are willing to pay for your part. This assumes equality and leaves the door open for them to offer pay if they really want to take you to this particular venue.\n\nThe alternative is often to suggest if they want to go to an expensive place then they must foot the bill and that is much less palatable.", "Perfect.\n\nThis--along with 63% of the posts in this sub--could be answered with some form of: \"Use your words.\"", "This is a sexy answer to good men.  NAH. \n\nIt lets us be Big Damn Heros by gallantly offering either accommodate you by going for coffee or doing something free, or telling you they were planning on paying. Anyone that reacts badly to this is saving your time in finding out they are the worst.", "I think you mean NAH. The dude isn\u2019t an asshole either.", "Yes and even better to suggest coffee. It's less pressure than dinner anyway.", "I don't think anyone is intentionally implying he's an asshole, just that she's definitely not, so you're right, NAH.", "Meeting in a cafe is a great alternative to a potentially expensive dinner but I find it impolite to order before the person shows up. In my world, you meet in front, go in together and order together. It would be a turn off for me that a person already ordered.

Good luck, have fun.", "Thanks so much for the advice! Definitely wording will help, but I was still so worried even bringing it up would be an ah move.

Money & parents perception certainly play into it. Good luck on your date. \ud83c\udf40", "N T A does, indeed, mean someone else is the asshole, using AITA's voting system.

I think it\u2019s awesome.", "NAH.\nI've always been one to pay on dates, other than special occasions, but it's always appreciated when a date offers.

I suppose *maybe* some guys would be offended that she didn't think he was going to be paying for the date, but I hate when people assume, especially when that assumption is what somebody else is going to do with their own money.", "To me, \u201ctalking about money\u201d means bragging to others about how much money you have, especially when you know they have less than you do. And phrasing it like, \u201cAre you offering to pay for me? Because if not, I want to pick a cheaper restaurant\u201d is also tacky. But something like the other poster suggested, where you\u2019re just stating that you can\u2019t afford X restaurant but would love to go to do Y instead, isn\u2019t really \u201ctalking about money\u201d in my book.", "It is not \u00abtalking about money\u00bb, it is communication", "Take your stupid upvote", "\"Oh, you're one of those FEMINISTS that think women are equal, gross.\"\n\nThat would save so much time and therapy.", "(Takes my bow)", "Honestly, it's probably a good litmus test if something like this happens at the start of seeing somebody. I'm pretty clearly a feminist on all my dating profiles and I make it clear early on, but this is an extra layer of like \"are you ok with women being people?\"  I imagine to men, if a woman automatically expects a man to pay on a date without prior discussion (in 2023!), it's not a great sign. But if a date (of any gender) can't handle moving the date to somewhere a bit more affordable, especially for the first date, it's also a pretty bad sign."]}
