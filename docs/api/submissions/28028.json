While she was in hospice care my aunt had made comments about wanting the house to be known as hers but I brushed that off because it wasn\u2019t the time for that. \n\nI knew what was in the will because I was there when she revised it the first time when my aunt Kathy died and then was consulted again 2 years ago when my mother died and she had to change it again. \nBoth times all that changed were names. When her daughters died she changed their parts to their respective children. And a new executor was appointed. This last time she felt she had to pick her only living daughter but she wasn\u2019t sure she would be able to do the job so she asked if me and my cousin would be ok with being back ups just in case. So we were. \n\nFast forward to when she died and my aunt announces that her and her husband will be moving into the house and keeping everything exactly like it is. She also said she will not be paying any debts from my grandmother because \u201cthat\u2019s just wrong\u201d. \n\nWhen I told her that\u2019s not how the will is written she said that we can\u2019t find the will but since she is the only surviving child the house goes to her. She will split the land like she knew the wills said that but the house and all the belongings are hers now. Mind you my grandmother is not even in the ground. \n\nWe find the will and it\u2019s like I thought everything is split in 3rds and if anyone wants to sell their portion of the house it has to be offered to family first at fair market value and if someone wants it then they have to buy the other two parties out. The house sits on 1 acre separate from the rest of the acreage. \n\nWe go see a lawyer and she says she will not be paying us and that honestly it should be hers because she outlived my Aunt And Mother.  Her husband and one daughter both agree with her whole heartedly and I don\u2019t understand how we see it so different. \n\nMy grandmother revised the will twice in 4 years. If she wanted her to have the house she could have done so. \n\nNow I\u2019m being called greedy to my face and much worse behind my back and I don\u2019t know where to go from here.  \n\nI\u2019m in Texas if that makes any difference\n\nEditing to add that we have found copies of the will but not the original. She is also crying poor and not able to pay for probate which is why I went to the lawyer with her. I wasn\u2019t going to give her money but I would have helped her by paying him directly. That is until she acted like she did in there. \n\nI offered to let her live in the house and keep it in all our names till she passed and then letting all the grandkids sort it out. Her husband hated that idea \n\nI also offer her to trade some of her 18acres that\u2019s she\u2019s inheriting and that made her super mad.", "created_utc": 1696197641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xebdq/aita_for_not_giving_my_aunt_my_13rd_of_my/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was probably hoping you'd go ahead and give her the house before the will was found and at that point it would have been \"oops too late I already live here\" lol \n\nIt's absolutely horrible that she thinks because she outlived her sisters that their children shouldn't get anything.

Sorry for your loss.", "NTA  Your grandmother updated her will often enough that you can be assured she wanted it just as it is stated.  She probably didn't like your aunt enough to want to give it all to her.  OR like my mother she split it evenly amongst her children and when those weren't available she passed it down to those children's children.

You will get a nice chunk of change that can really make a difference at this stage in your life...plus your aunt will get some money too so it's not like you're leaving her high and dry! But you deserve the money your grandma wanted YOU to have!

That isn't what your grandma wanted.", "Exactly - your grandmother seemed to be ON IT for updating her will, so the chances that she made this huge change and then didn\u2019t update the will seems uncharacteristic.

Anyone questions you, reply with that.", "It\u2019s literally the first thing in the will is that the executor has to pay debts including funeral and debts from last sickness. \nWhen she died I automatically paid a 3rd of her funeral without being asked because it was the last thing I could do for her.

I miss them and my other aunt so much right now.", "The original could be held by your grandmother\u2019s estate planning attorney.

Your Grandma had not 1 but 2 opportunities to leave the house only to her daughter but she didn't.  Your Aunt is being disrespectful to you, and her own mother as well.  Follow the will, its what your Grandmother wanted.", "I promote it with all of my tax clients because it saves a fortune and time.  At least you know now, and promote it with your other personal properties because you can have a primary, and two alternate beneficiaries so unless you run through all three, you don't have to keep revising.  Also you're allowed to have it titled to a business, trust, or estate as well instead of just an actual person FYI.", "That\u2019s how I got a copy since my aunt stated it didn\u2019t say in the will that she had to show it to anyone or give any copies \ud83d\ude44\n\nThey don\u2019t have the original.

I wish this was more well known. I was planning on having it set into a living trust so it automatically went to my grandkids if something happened to me and my husband. But this sounds much easier. Thank you again!", "A copy of the Will is fine, just proceed with probate and if you have to shell out $$ to the lawyer the estate will pay you back. Of course you aren\u2019t greedy. Hopefully the 3rd party will team up with you and she has to buy you both out at fair market value or y\u2019all evict her and sell it. She\u2019s trying to commit fraud, why would you feel guilty?", "The county property tax office alerted me to it is how I found out.  Glad to be of service."]}
