What is your income ratio? \n\nTLDR: If you guys split things 50-50 in general, you should split the mortgage on a post-equity basis, not a pre-equity one.\n\nI think the fairest splits in a long-term relationship is to give each partner an allowance and then take the remainder, make it a ratio, and split expenses according to that ratio. For example, if A makes $2000/mo and B makes $4000/mo, then each partner gets (say) $500/mo in allowance and then the ratio is 1500:3500, or for every $100 in expenses, A will pay about 30 and B will pay about 70.\n\nIn my personal case, I don't follow that advice. I own a home, which I bought while my SO and I were together (and I would not have bought without their influence), but they did not want to contibute to the down payment or other associated costs so it ended up in my name only. However, I foot the entire bill for mortgage, utilities, taxes, and maintenance, while we split without doing much math on food, small appliances, decor, and incidentals.\n\nI choose to do this because while the cost of the home is stressful (its pretty close to what I can afford and still be net positive after 401K), the fact that I am the one building the equity in the house is a big deal. I certainly don't think it would be fair to charge them 50% of the cost of home ownership, or even the mortgage, since an ever increasing proportion of that is straight into my pocket.\n\nYour SO is not your landlord - or at least, that's a very unhealthy approach imo, although the popular commenters in this thread seem to think different. \n\nYou should not be charged half of going market rate for the home. That's absolutely nuts. Similarly, if going market rate is way above the cost of the mortgage, its not like your SO should be trying to make a profit off of you anyway. \n\nThe most fair way to split would be to take the overall mortgage payment, deduct the principal, and then split the remainder however you split your finances.\n\nRegardless of market rate, your SO should not be acting like a landlord who is out to turn a profit and exploit (for lack of a better word) a renter to cover their investment. You should be sharing the cost of your living arrangement (imo, including maintenance, etc.) but you should not be giving her money to pocket by way of equity in her home.", "Not enough information.

You have no reason to put money into...say a foundation repair or roof replacement---that risk is on her. you can just peace out.", "\"You should never be financially better off or worse off by being in a relationship.  \nYou should structure your finances so that there is no financial incentive to stay in a relationship or leave a relationship.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get where you are coming from but I disagree with this. OP has stated that half the fair market value of the house would be equivalent to about 60-75% of the mortgage. I do think that is the base to use, but I don't think that is what OP should pay. \n\nI think it should be generally \"you should never be significantly better off or worse financially by being in a relationship. \n\nIf OP paid 60-75% of the mortgage GF would be benefiting significantly from their partner, by paying a very low rate. If OP paid 40% or less they would be benefiting significantly from the GF.  \n\nI think 50% is a reasonable amount, because both benefit, OP saves money compared to the market rate for the house, and GF gets help with the mortgage and free equity. Could GF get even more money on the open market sure, but then they would have to live with a roommate not a significant other/partner.", "Or, better yet: buy your own property, rent it out, use the rent you get to pay for your own mortgage so you don't have to change your living arrangements. \n\nThis way you have your own investment and will own a property as well after you are done paying mortgage. Of course you'd have the same long term investment risk your girlfried does, but it would pay off in a couple of years and there would be no unnecessary envy within the relationship.", "Thanks, but this completely misses the point. It is her house and will remain her house. I will never have any claim to the equity. I will never be on the deed.\n\nGiven that, the question is \"how much is the fair amount for me to be paying in rent\".", "Yes? Profit? What else is the equity? \n\nI'd change my mind if they don't split everything house-related evenly.\n\nPersonally, I think expense should be split along income ratios, but we have no idea what this is in this case.", "Yeah, ok sure but the question is \"how much rent is fair\".\n\nThe answer is absolutely not \"whatever the landlord wants is fair\".", "He\u2019s paying *below* market rent.", "I may not have \u201canswered\u201d but it\u2019s the truth.  I\u2019ve stayed full opinion in other comments.\n\nIf he\u2019s sooooo upset about paying *below market* rent at his girlfriends house he\u2019s free to leave.", "He addressed that in different comments.  He never said he\u2019d get his own place he just compared the rent values.  Nothing is stopping him from moving out and getting his own place.  If he already feels like his girlfriend is \u201cmilking him\u201d why bother staying?  Go be free get his own place.", "You use the down-payment as an example. I think it perfectly illustrates what you don't understand about this situation.\n\nThe down-payment goes 100% to paying down the principal / increasing equity. In other words, when you pay a down-payment, you are paying yourself. Certainly you don't think I should pay half of the down-payment? That would be like me moving $30k from checking checking account into my savings account, and charging my gf $15k for it. Absurd.", "So yup, giant asshole", "There's \"fair\" between strangers and \"fair\" between family/SOs, etc. Why are we hell bent on pretending there is not?", "Well he said he has a job so in principle he could get a mortgage on his own place, possibly by splitting it with someone. It doesn't really matter if he would, just that he could in principle.\n\nAnd he didn't say his girlfriend is offering an ultimatum. For all we know she might agree to him paying less. So I don't see why it's a \"take it or leave it\" situation.", ">You use the down-payment as an example. I think it perfectly illustrates what you don't understand about this situation.\n\nMaybe I was not clear enough, if so I apologize for the confusion. I do understand how down payments work. No I am not saying you should pay half of the down-payment just for renting. If you wanted to get your name on the deed, that would be different. \n\n The down-payment certainly impacts the price of the mortgage, the higher down payment a person puts down the lower the monthly mortgage and vice versa. My point was that by your GF making a down-payment, closing costs, (aka buying a house) you benefit because it ends up with a lower housing payment than if the two of you were renting that house together on the open market.  \n\nYes, your GF gets equity from what you pay in rent, but in almost any situation you are paying someone's equity and/or income if they don't have a mortgage. \n\nMy broader point was that it does not matter how much equity a person has in the house/property to if and how much you should pay in rent. But especially when you end up getting a cheaper place to live because of that. \n\nEven if your GF had the house paid off, you would still owe and should pay rent. Especially because even then there are still ongoing home owners insurance costs, taxes, maintenance  (roof replacement, appliances, heaters, a/c, boilers etc..) costs. So part of rent should also go towards a rainy day fund for those things. \n\nAgain if you don't want to be a renter buy your own place, or buy into your GF's house at full costs. Starting to pay half the mortgage now does not entitle you to half the equity because your GF has already paid a lot of costs towards it.", "Pretty much in an older comment he said \u201cfair market rent\u201d would between 60-75% of her monthly mortgage.  But he doesn\u2019t want to pay it or 50% because he doesn\u2019t want his girlfriend to milk him.  Yet he\u2019s the one milking her by trying to get below market rent even lower.", "Because he\u2019s making it seem like it.  If I found out my boyfriend was accusing me of taking advantage of him while already \u201ccharging\u201d him **below** market rent I would feel hurt.  He never said if he wanted his own house or mortgage so moot point whatever.  \n\nLooking at it from what he would be paying *if* he wasn\u2019t living with her.  He would be paying 60-75% of what her mortgage is in rent.  So regardless of semantics he would be paying more.  So he can be upset but he also needs to realize he\u2019s still paying a fair amount.  Why should he have to pay less just because it\u2019s her property??  Why should he benefit just because he thinks it\u2019s unfair??", "As I  said, if he wasn't living with her he could buy a house, or jointly buy one with someone else (and pay the same 50% of the mortgage but get half the equity). That's why most couples just buy together. I understand his partner's desire to have her own investment without him, but in that case she shouldn't expect him to pay half her mortgage for her like a tenant. I don't think either of them are the AH though, it's not always straightforward to think these things through.", "In the end he\u2019s free to do what he wants.  Quit complaining about being \u201cmilked\u201d and get your own place.  Or realize it\u2019s fair and live with it."]}
