But I did say \u201chappy Mother\u2019s Day\u201d to my wife after she told me that it was Mother\u2019s Day after she spent the night hanging out with her friends while I took care of the baby with my FIL. \n\nNow today rolled around, I invited my best friend to hangout with me and smoke some weed to distress. I made the plan with my man yesterday, before my wife told me that today\u2019s international Mother\u2019s Day this morning.

My wife asked if I could get her sushi takeaway, I agreed. \n\nI already compromised by doing all the chores around the house today and letting my friend know that my wife would like an early night so he leaves by 8pm. But things happened and my friend left around 9pm. Now my wife came to me and said she\u2019s hungry, and asked if I\u2019d still order the sushi for her. I was not hungry and we have food in the freezer, but I said yes and she picked something from her favourite restaurant on the delivery app. After she picked I took awhile longer to pick because I like to take my time when I choose my food. But when I tried to order at 9:16pm, the restaurant had just stopped receiving orders at 9:15pm. \n\nNow my wife is upset that I \u201cdragged on\u201d to order her something. I wasn\u2019t even supposed to treat her today as it\u2019s not even a holiday in our country. I agreed to order for her anyways as a courtesy.
