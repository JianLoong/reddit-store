But I did say \u201chappy Mother\u2019s Day\u201d to my wife after she told me that it was Mother\u2019s Day after she spent the night hanging out with her friends while I took care of the baby with my FIL. \n\nNow today rolled around, I invited my best friend to hangout with me and smoke some weed to distress. I made the plan with my man yesterday, before my wife told me that today\u2019s international Mother\u2019s Day this morning.

My wife asked if I could get her sushi takeaway, I agreed. \n\nI already compromised by doing all the chores around the house today and letting my friend know that my wife would like an early night so he leaves by 8pm. But things happened and my friend left around 9pm. Now my wife came to me and said she\u2019s hungry, and asked if I\u2019d still order the sushi for her. I was not hungry and we have food in the freezer, but I said yes and she picked something from her favourite restaurant on the delivery app. After she picked I took awhile longer to pick because I like to take my time when I choose my food. But when I tried to order at 9:16pm, the restaurant had just stopped receiving orders at 9:15pm. \n\nNow my wife is upset that I \u201cdragged on\u201d to order her something. I wasn\u2019t even supposed to treat her today as it\u2019s not even a holiday in our country. I agreed to order for her anyways as a courtesy.

Picking up some sushi didn\u2019t sound like a big ask.", "NTA .This is the reason I chose to tell my husband that I do not want gifts for holidays and birthdays. So many people get upset about these situations. I grew up watching older family and friends getting so upset at their spouses for not doing something for them for these holidays. I told myself I would never put that pressure on my spouse. We do things because we want not because it is expected. If I don't get anything, I am not upset. He and I get things for eachother through out the year.  I think you need to have a conversation with your spouse about your and her expectations when it comes to these holidays.

Instead, you made plans for a nice day for yourself. You stomped all over your own promises. Your friend should have been gone by 8:00 p.m. Actually, should never have been there today. Then you dragged it out so long it was too late to order the sushi. Then, you tried to cover up for that by saying there was food in the freezer! Do you have a clue how long it takes to thaw food?

Is doing something she specifically asked you to do, which costs you very little and will make her happy, really such a big deal that you think we'll all think it's fine you couldn't be fucked?", "YTA. You royally screwed up her first ever Mother\u2019s Day, and made plenty of excuses for yourself.
