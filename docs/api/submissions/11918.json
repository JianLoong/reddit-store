You didn't discuss it at all in the post, only what your neighbor has done to the plants", "NTA\n\nThere is no way you are in the wrong. This is really terrible for him to do and there is no reason you would be in the wrong. \n\nAn AVO also won't negatively impact him if he is doing nothing wrong. Honestly I would be pushing for charges and recovering damages.", "We've got security cameras and when we saw police they wanted to charge him because we've got evidence of him doing it and witness statements from neighbours who've seen him doing it.", "I've already contacted EPA (aus) but never heard back.", "We have been documenting everything since the beginning. My husband never wanted to act on it because he believed our neighbour would stop and be civil.", "We know for a fact he doesn't have dementia, as we have been in touch with his family (all estranged). He was able to recall poisoning our yard and admitted to other neighbours about it. We have the police involved and going to court next week to get the orders. We were warned 7 years ago before we moved in about how dangerous of a man he is.", "If he's 87, it's not early onset dementia.", "Mistake, apprehended violence order but the one we applied for under police and court advice was the pAVO", "I'm in Australia. Not many HOAs here. The police are already involved.", "We didn't know he was poisoning in the backyard until we put the garden there. It was all dry sand there since we moved in. I only caught him spraying out the front and side. Only found out when I couldn't keep my plants alive.", "An avo is like a restraining order in Australia. You can apply for them at the court house or police can apply for them on your behalf.", "Happy cake day! Are the police going to charge him?", "So charge him. You can make him responsible for anything he damaged that was paid for and may even have to pay for new grass. What a great birthday present that would be", "Throw the book at him", "Sorry to hear that. UK usually moves faster.", "I'd try local council. It might differ by state, but in NSW this should be under the remit of the environmental health and building officers.", "Excellent. Clear documentation will help you. The neighbor seems very committed to continue what they view as right. Best to you.", "Based on what, besides wishful thinking? \n\nPast behaviour is the best way to predict future behaviour.", "If they are estranged from him how can they be reliable sources about his health?", "OP you need to go into [**https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/) because that's where you may get some ideas on how to get back at him to stop making your life miserable.", "Not everyone is from Australia; it's best to explain local legal terminology like that if you use it in a post.", "Good. The situation would have probably have escalated further without intervention. You are definitely NTA for this, honestly I'd say you were very patient.", "My husband told them not to pursue any charges just yet.", "Everything's pretty slow in Aus unfortunately", "Council wanted nothing to do with it unfortunately. I have it in writing that they refused to help with our situation.", "I wanted to act a long time ago. My husband didn't want to cause further conflict.", "They have medical power of attorney.", "Why on earth not?  He was intentionally poisoning edible plants your children might have eaten!  This person needs to be arrested.", "Of course your choice fully. He's been doing this for 7 years? Is that right? How much longer are you wait?", "You should have him charged as soon as it happens again. If he hasn't changed his ways already, he isn't going to.", "Huge mistake. Not taking action only emboldens your asshole neighbour because he thinks you\u2019re pushovers and he can get away with anything he wants. Ask the police to take action, and go to your legal representative and sue him for damages. SHOW NO MERCY. **NTA.**", "You should press charges this way there is an investigation and maybe they can see if he needs help. \n\nTo me, your neighbour doesn\u2019t sound okay\u2026 is there any family with him or that visits that you can talk to about his obsessive behavior? Does he do other strange things?", "He's never done it to this extent before. Never obvious it was patches of dead grass no wider than an oven and few and far between. This time it's over 30meters of fence 1.5meters wide.", "That's what the AVO is for. If he damages our property again he will be charged.", "Why just not be honest with him. Tell him you have security footage of him and have already contacted the police. They have seen the footage and are prepared to press charges. The only reason they haven't is yourbhusband is trying to be reasonable. But if he so much as looks in your yard again thr police will be coming by to arrest him. If that doesn't get him to stop then he deserves it.", "Oh man...sorry. That sucks!", "We've been honest with him and confronted him on more than one occasion. He couldn't give two shits about the damage he caused or the potential harm he did to my children.", "Then file the charges. At this point you have done all you can. If he knows you have already talked to the police and he doesn't care an AVO is just putting off the inevitable.  He's still going to fuck up and get arrested so why not cut out the middle man and just press the charges.", "And you haven't charged him yet because....? You need to draw a clear line or it'll only escalate further.  I'm also wonder if mental issues could be at play.", "Because he knows this is the extent of what you will do. Get him charged."]}
