She asked if I could loan her $500 to help her out, promising to pay me back as soon as she could. While I empathized with her situation, I had also lent her money twice before in the past, and she never managed to pay me back fully.\n\nDecision: This time, I politely declined her request for a loan, explaining that I had been struggling to manage my own finances lately and couldn't afford to lend her any money at the moment. I suggested that she explore other options, such as seeking help from family or finding part-time work to supplement her income.\n\nResponse: Jane was extremely upset and accused me of not being a true friend. She argued that I should be there for her during her time of need, especially since we had been friends for so long. She claimed that I was being selfish and unreasonable.\n\nFeedback: Some of our mutual friends have chimed in, saying that I should have helped Jane out despite my own financial struggles, as that's what real friends do.

Sometimes your better off without friends like this....", "NTA.  If you could afford to give the money away and love her company, offer her the loan. If you can\u2019t afford to lose the money, you\u2019re under no obligation to do so.  If you cannot afford to lain her the money, tell her so (and remind her that you haven\u2019t received your money back file the last two loans).", "NTA. Never lend money to friends, ever. Or if you do, let them borrow what you\u2019re comfortable with losing. It causes severed friendships because of just that, they never pay it back. Or pay back as little as they can. $500 is a hell of a lot of money to borrow to someone to begin with. You may want to evaluate your friend circle for them to say something that ridiculous. If they think \u201cacting like a true friend\u201d means you being broke, I just can\u2019t see the rationale in that logic.

Would she lend you the money if you asked with her financial troubles", "I've been the friend to borrow money recently. Life's been really tough. You are NTA.
