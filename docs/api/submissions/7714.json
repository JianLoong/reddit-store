I work as a waitress, and I couldn't get into bed before cleaning myself up and putting on fresh pj's!!! I don't even think it's as bad as fast food, because I'm not near the fryers often, and our kitchen is a little bigger. But getting in bed before freshening up just grosses me out!!! That said, some men can be a little more lax when it comes to cleanliness (for lack of a better word, and I'm sure some women fall into this category as well).

Nope. If he's going to continue that nonsense, get him his own bedroom. Preferably with its own access from outside, so his grimies can stay out of the clean part of the house.", "NTA.

So yeah, OP and partner are breathing whatever he touched/touched him all day; oil, antifreeze, diesel, etc. It's been determined that back in the day tradesmen who came home in their work clothes brought asbestos into their homes.

You know, a clinical psychologist might see only a small handful of cases involving gaslighting throughout their entire career. Gaslighting is a severely devastating form of psychological abuse, and just like the word \u201cabuse\u201d in general, it\u2019s being thrown around with such casualty as one might speak of taking out the trash. \n\nMy mother was abused growing up. She was burned, beaten, whipped, and verbally abused. Her older sister endured the same but was also raped repeatedly by their father. Her younger brother was beaten and repeatedly sexually assaulted as well. \n\nTo hear people refer to rude behavior, passive aggressiveness, and general inconsideration as abuse is truly enraging. Because I think of what my mother and her siblings went through, and what nameless people are going through now as we speak, and how the impacts of that man are still felt every day in my family, 40 years later. And I think when we use these terms to describe bad behavior it devalues that lived experience.", "this is not gaslighting", ":O WHAT  \n\n\nAll my tradie relatives and ex boyfriends would not even sit on the inside furniture in their work clothes even if they were supervisors/electricians etc so not covered in visible dirt.
