I had a few messages from some of you asking for an update on what happened.\n\nJames moved out and, as far as I know, is staying with family while looking for a new place. We are no longer friends/are now NC with each other. I still talk to our mutuals, which is who I heard updates from his situation from. They've remained neutral though and for the most part don't bring him up around me anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, Arrow passed away a few weeks before Christmas. He had major organ failure and urinary infection and was in a lot of pain with no chance of significant improvement so I had to make a very hard choice. It's been difficult getting through the holidays, but I wanted to provide an update because the fact that Arrow is loved and remembered by not just me but a whole bunch of people he never even met is a little bit of comfort.", "created_utc": 1672956714, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104bwgu/update_aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_move_out/", "score": 340, "replies": ["I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a pet can feel like having a limb cut off. This piece of you that's been there consistently for so long is just gone. You come home expecting them to be there and that realization that they aren't brings all the pain right back up to the surface. Be kind to yourself. Arrow loves you and only wants you to be happy. Sending love.", "Oh, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Your love for your dog will live on in Reddit history. The energy that was Arrow will never leave, only change. He will literally, always be part of your world, just in a different form.", "Sorry for your loss. That asshole made your dogs final time stressful and painful, I'd never forgive him personally.\n\nBest wishes for your healing heart.", "So sorry for your loss. \u2764\ufe0f", "My condolences", "So sorry for your loss, thank you for the update.", "So sorry for your loss.

I lost my oldest fur baby in November and it still hurts like it was yesterday. But we take comfort knowing their pain is over and our lives were better for having had them in it. \n\nI firmly believe the amount of pain you feel is equal to the love you shared. I know it's hard but try to remember the warmth of his love and know he's still there and always will be.", "Can we see some pictures of Arrow?", "I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nRemember that  you did one last act of love for him, and he knew it.

Neither of you deserved this!

The bigger the love, the bigger the grief. My deepest sympathy for your loss. I wish I could say the pain goes away, but in truth, it doesn\u2019t. It just gets farther away with time. I still grieve my childhood pup, I still grieve the cat my husband and I lose 3 winters ago. Sending hugs. Please cry all the tears and know that your Pup isn\u2019t in pain anymore.", "Truly sorry you had to say goodbye to your best boy.

This update makes me sad. You told him repeatedly the doctor said the food was advancing his illness and he didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m really sorry this all happened. I hope you are ok.", "I'm so sorry you lost Arrow.", "Right! Who throws up after eating and say I\u2019m just living life! No one. It wasn\u2019t like a few extra poops or farts dogs have as a reaction to some food. It was making him sicker, faster. I\u2019m glad op\u2019s friends don\u2019t bring up the other guy. He owes op an apology."]}
