I had a few messages from some of you asking for an update on what happened.\n\nJames moved out and, as far as I know, is staying with family while looking for a new place. We are no longer friends/are now NC with each other. I still talk to our mutuals, which is who I heard updates from his situation from. They've remained neutral though and for the most part don't bring him up around me anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, Arrow passed away a few weeks before Christmas. He had major organ failure and urinary infection and was in a lot of pain with no chance of significant improvement so I had to make a very hard choice. It's been difficult getting through the holidays, but I wanted to provide an update because the fact that Arrow is loved and remembered by not just me but a whole bunch of people he never even met is a little bit of comfort.", "created_utc": 1672956714, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104bwgu/update_aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_move_out/", "score": 135, "replies": ["I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a pet can feel like having a limb cut off. This piece of you that's been there consistently for so long is just gone.
