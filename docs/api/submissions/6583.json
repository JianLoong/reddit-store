I had a few messages from some of you asking for an update on what happened.\n\nJames moved out and, as far as I know, is staying with family while looking for a new place. We are no longer friends/are now NC with each other. I still talk to our mutuals, which is who I heard updates from his situation from. They've remained neutral though and for the most part don't bring him up around me anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, Arrow passed away a few weeks before Christmas. He had major organ failure and urinary infection and was in a lot of pain with no chance of significant improvement so I had to make a very hard choice. It's been difficult getting through the holidays, but I wanted to provide an update because the fact that Arrow is loved and remembered by not just me but a whole bunch of people he never even met is a little bit of comfort.", "created_utc": 1672956714, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104bwgu/update_aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_move_out/", "score": 1744, "replies": ["I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a pet can feel like having a limb cut off. This piece of you that's been there consistently for so long is just gone.

Sending love.", "Oh, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Your love for your dog will live on in Reddit history. The energy that was Arrow will never leave, only change.

I lost my oldest fur baby in November and it still hurts like it was yesterday. But we take comfort knowing their pain is over and our lives were better for having had them in it. \n\nI firmly believe the amount of pain you feel is equal to the love you shared. I know it's hard but try to remember the warmth of his love and know he's still there and always will be.", "Can we see some pictures of Arrow?", "I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nRemember that  you did one last act of love for him, and he knew it.

Neither of you deserved this!

The bigger the love, the bigger the grief. My deepest sympathy for your loss. I wish I could say the pain goes away, but in truth, it doesn\u2019t. It just gets farther away with time. I still grieve my childhood pup, I still grieve the cat my husband and I lose 3 winters ago. Sending hugs.

I hope you are ok.", "I'm so sorry you lost Arrow.", "Right! Who throws up after eating and say I\u2019m just living life! No one. It wasn\u2019t like a few extra poops or farts dogs have as a reaction to some food. It was making him sicker, faster. I\u2019m glad op\u2019s friends don\u2019t bring up the other guy. He owes op an apology.", "It sounds like you took amazing care of each other, with him getting you through tough times and you taking such good care of him in his old age.

I too was protective of her health to the end and I can assure you that the special care you took gave you much more precious time with your pup. His final years were comfortable and happy because you made sure his tummy felt good. You\u2019re a good person and Arrow was so lucky to have you. I know in the beginning the grief is like swallowing glass. I promise that slowly, the glass\u2019s sharp edges sand down and over time, all that pain becomes beautiful little marbles that you can look into and see your good memories.

May you both find some peace, and may he run free and rest easy.", "It's harder than you'd ever think. I had to say goodbye to my best friend a week before thanksgiving a year ago. And his little brother a few months after. Over a year later and I still go to their favorite places to play and think about them.

It\u2019s a beautiful heartbreak that we have when we lose a dog, especially one that changes our lives. It\u2019s good to hear that you\u2019ve cut that person out of your life when he couldn\u2019t respect your choices about your own animal.

It really is such a hard decision to make. I lost both my babies less than a year apart. They were 16 and 18. My boy was born into my hand and my girl was removed from an abuse situation when she was just a few months old. This was my first Christmas in 18 years without a baby. It is so hard to be without them.", "No one except for some lactose intolerant people.

James is a total jerk.", "You did what you could to make your dog happy which is wonderful. So sorry about your loss.", "Did you make him pay for the vet bills? I would\u2019ve.

I\u2019m sure he knew just how much you loved him", "I'm so sorry for your loss. I recently lost my cat in a similar fashion. People have a horrible, misguided tendency to personify pets in a dangerous way. I was chided all the time: \"He's an old man, let him enjoy the things he wants to enjoy while he still can.\" Never mind the fact he literally didn't know any better or, you know, the fact they were literally shaving years of my baby's life. I'm so very sorry.", "And the costs of the vet visits...", "Lactose intolerant person here who definitely still eats dairy. Can confirm. I can have some dairy, but if I have too much I get hit with intense nausea that I just have to wait it out cause nothing will make it better but time. The amount of dairy I can have before my body reacts tends to fluctuate so I never know how much will set my stomach off. This does not stop me from playing ice cream Russian roulette.  Is today a day where I can eat this without issues, or is today a day where any dairy at all is too much?  Who knows. (I do buy lactose free milk though partially to avoid symptoms partially cause it lasts SO MUCH LONGER)", "Lactase tablets exist and they work, and they're not hugely expensive either! Get some, they're an absolute life changer.", "Oh I sometimes have them. I'll use them when I'm going through a period when my dairy limit is very low and then I'll run out and just kinda risk it for a while. If I'm mostly fine I won't bother getting more till I hit another \"any dairy is bad\" moment. Maybe it's a day later, maybe it's several months later. My body is weird. (I'm sorry there's some sort of logical reason relating to the rest of my diet or something but I can't be bothered to make the effort to try to figure it out)", "Condolences for your loss.

It's a bereavement like any other and tough.\n\nPeople who don't respect a reasonable boundary shouldn't expect to live with you. Hopefully he learned something.", "Absolutely NTA! James deserved to ne kicked out. I'm so sorry for your loss of Arrow. Sounds like he was very lucky to have a caring, loving owner/friend like you. I hope your grief is replaced by all the happy times you had with Arrow. Let yourself grieve. I had to put down my little dog and best friend in 2019 due to liver failure and man, it hurt. Even though I knew it was the kindest thing I could do for him. You did all the right things. Rest in peace, sweet Arrow.", "I have a dog that is on a strict diet for the same reasons.

You're an amazing pet parent.", "Can\u2019t imagine having a friend be neutral about someone killing my dog", "I'm so incredibly sorry for your loss, my beloved dog Jack passed in 2017 and I miss him everyday still. Animals are family and I know that he knew that you loved and cared for him an incredible amount and that he felt the same to you. \n\nI am side eyeing your friends a bit in this though, I just dont know that I could personally be friends with people who still associate with the direct cause of his passing and think it's something to be moved past.", "I'm so sorry. Was he named Arrow from the movie The Point? https://i.imgur.com/nyaKQUN.jpg", "I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a furry family member is devastating, especially around the holidays.

You did the right thing for Arrow, and I'm sure in many years, you'll still miss him, while you'll have completely forgotten James.", "I'm so sorry about Arrow. He was the best of boys, I'm sure.", "I\u2019m so sorry. Can you share a pic of Arrow and maybe your favorite story with?", "I am very sorry for your loss. Arrow was extremely lucky to have an owner who cared for him up until is old age the way that you did.", "Lactose intolerant AND celiac..... Sometimes bread and dairy are simply too irresistible.... Bread makes me like if I eat much of it but god DAMN PASTRIES ARE TOO GOOD :((((", "Hey I do want to caution you on the nausea bit, normal lactose intolerance shouldnt cause nausea just bathroom issues. I thought it was normal lactose intolerance but my nauseous reaction was actually the development of what is actually a dairy allergy that put me in the hospital for a little bit.  If lactose free milk still causes a reaction even if it's a much milder one I would put some serious thought into considering that it could be an allergy over intolerance."]}
