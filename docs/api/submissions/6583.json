I had a few messages from some of you asking for an update on what happened.\n\nJames moved out and, as far as I know, is staying with family while looking for a new place. We are no longer friends/are now NC with each other. I still talk to our mutuals, which is who I heard updates from his situation from. They've remained neutral though and for the most part don't bring him up around me anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, Arrow passed away a few weeks before Christmas. He had major organ failure and urinary infection and was in a lot of pain with no chance of significant improvement so I had to make a very hard choice. It's been difficult getting through the holidays, but I wanted to provide an update because the fact that Arrow is loved and remembered by not just me but a whole bunch of people he never even met is a little bit of comfort.", "created_utc": 1672956714, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104bwgu/update_aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_move_out/", "score": 2850, "replies": ["I'm so sorry for your loss.

Mine did. Because of the gluten, the body is already in a \"hyper aware\" mode, and will give allergic reactions to thing you are otherwhise not allergic to. If you like pastries, learn to bake lol.

Within 10 minutes, pizza had come back up into the toilet and 30 minutes later, I was in the ER in anaphylactic shock.\n\nSo I continue to be one of those stubborn lactose intolerant people who will eat a bit of dairy and then complain about self inflicted bathroom issues \ud83d\ude02", "The lactose pills do still work for me when I bother you take them. And lactose free milk doesn't bother me at all. It's just regular milk (which I almost never buy) or good quality ice cream that will set me off. \n\nMy mother is also Lactose Intolerant but has a much more consistent level of tolerance.", "I'm sorry for your loss, and since I didn't get to comment on the last post. F*CK James. He was an AH", "I\u2019m sorry for your lost. I hope you also cut off the mutual friends who said Arrow didn\u2019t have much time anyways so he can enjoy the junk food", "Reddit doesn't cater to everyone otherwise the whole site would have to come with a trigger warning.", "It's just a hard and pretty expensive thing to avoid. I've done my best to eat more rice and potatos, and only eat gluten free pasta (so glad it's on par with $ and actually taste good. I love pasta) \n\nI have yet to find a GF bread that hasn't sucked ass so my sandwiches are on romaine but fuck man even ignoring the MAJOR gluten things (bread pastries ect) everything has some kind of freaking gluten in it. \n\n I just. That's a lot to deal with esp when I have texture adversions to a lot of veggies (desperately wish I didn't) I've been looking into some kind of like drinkable veggie thing my sister has but god it tastes gross. \n\n(I once found GF brownies that rocked my world and then the bakery shut down . I literally only got them once I never had the chance, Heartbreaking that was...)", "They work\u2026 until they don\u2019t. About 10 years ago the lactase pills worked for me, and I only needed 1! Then I needed 3, then 5\u2026 now they don\u2019t work lol"]}
