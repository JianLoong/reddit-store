Ok, thanks. Still feel like there's some missing information about why that happened and why she feels like he's been keeping the kid from her. And why she can't be given some sort of limited visitation rights at least. But these stories where you only hear one person's limited side of things are often challenging to judge.", "Thats what i told myself for months. This isnt just about her dropping him but her not caring that she did. \n\nShe wasnt the one Picking him up. She wasn't the one getting him to the Hospital. She wasnt the one passing around like crazy because she was nervouse. \n\nShe stayed home ordering food and asking me why i was being so dramatic over it \"he's not an egg\" when i came back home.", "He knows about her he got name and pictures we never made a big secrect out of it. We told him he wasnt very nice to me to safe him from how she treated him. How ever when he got older and Asks more questions we will answer them truthfully", "She doesn't see OP and his husband as a legit family for OP's son, and that is a huge risk for parental alienation being done by her. Rather than try to prove she's a fit mother, or at least can be a stable presence for OP's son she's immediately on the attack. If she had grown up she'd know she has a lot of trust to earn and has no bargaining position beyond empty words.\n\nIn your case was the mother anything like OP's ex?\n\nThe whole deprived of a mother/father thing is meaningless. Gay couples or single parents can still have friends, family to provide kids with a maternal or paternal figure.", "Okay I'm gonna just chime in here.  \n\nOP mentioned that for the first 2 years the court didn't allow her to be around the child \n\nWhat OP didn't mentioned (I used to be his friends back then)  is that he still tried to get her to be part of the baby's live when the little one was 2 years old he was in the hospital fighting for his live OP called her and she said \"I don't care\" (basically)  \n\nHowever when she figured out that an adoption was supposed to happen she showed up on their doorstep OP wasn't home but his husband was he closed the door on her and threaned with the police.  She never showed up afterwards again.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s information missing. I think you\u2019re misunderstanding. I think she means going forward they can\u2019t keep her away forever. \n\nEither way, she has no legal rights. That\u2019s not her kid at this point. She abandoned the child. Any supposed missing information simply isn\u2019t relevant.", ">and why she feels like he's been keeping the kid from her.\n\nShe could just be an AH that refuses to acknowledge the reality of the situation.  Seems like she'd rather blame OP for \"keeping the kid from her\" rather than accepting her responsibility in this situation.  And   from OPs comments the legal facts are that this is no longer legally her child.  She had her rights terminated.", "She's literally Satan himself. Keep that child away from her. She's clearly narcissistic, even the way shes going about this years later, by demanding and having no respect for how this will affect him."]}
