Keep being that good person.", "NTA.another AITA that could have been resolved by a single, relatively short conversation.\n\nYour brother did exactly what your sister SHOULD have done and now she's probably very upset because she realises how epically fucking stupid her decisions were. No doubt she'll project some of that embarrassment on others and lash out, as is the way when people get owned as badly as this.", "NTA\n\nI understand your sister\u2019s reaction, but she took it all that way on a misunderstanding. \n\nYour parents should have made this known to all of you from the start. These days of easy DNA testing mean that these secrets are usually going to come out, and often badly. \n\nI was adopted, and knew from as early as I can remember. I\u2019m glad I did. I\u2019d hate to find out I\u2019d been lied to for decades. \n\nPeople should just be honest up front about this.  Society puts so much emphasis on \u201cbloodlines\u201d, and people think that is the end-all of being \u201crelated\u201d. Your parents are those who raised you, regardless of where the genes are from.", "NTA.  You\u2019re right.  Your parents suck on multiple levels, but if your sister had actually spoken to either of them five years ago, a lot of pain could have been avoided.", "NTA, I understand why she\u2019d be upset and why she\u2019d come to the conclusion that your mother cheated, but even believing that why would she cut off contact with her siblings, lose contact with her dad? She made those choices herself, she could\u2019ve confronted your mom and found out the truth five years ago, instead she decided to slowly cut off contact with her entire family? For five years? That just seems incredibly irrational to me. \n\nYour parents could (and maybe should) have told you all a lot sooner, sure, although I understand why they didn\u2019t, your dad is your father and those donors are just that, donors. \n\nFeels strange to me though that you never questioned your sister asking you for samples and never giving you results, especially due to the timing of her becoming distant and moving/losing contact, but I guess it wasn\u2019t your responsibility to figure that out. \n\nShe can be upset about losing 5 years with her family that\u2019s fair, but you all lost those 5 years with your sister/daughter too.", "NTA, your sister is horribly bad at communicating.", "Your parents should have told all of you. DNA tests are so common now that only willful blindness could have led to this. \n\n  Did you ever mention the DNA test to either parent?\n\nYour parents are both the AH's here.", "NAH. Your sister probably didn't want to ruin your family and tried to cut herself off in fear of heartbreak, while you missed your sister and got mad. Your family should have a talk with your sister and catch her up.", "NAH but at least one dumbass.\n\nI want to list what happened here:\n\n* OMG, my dad is not my bio-dad.\n* OMG, my sister and I have different bio-dads.\n* That's it, I'm not talking to anyone in the family.\n* I don't talk to anyone in the family for 5 years.\n* My sister and brother do their own testing. Dad is not their bio-dad.\n* Bro and Sis have conversations, and find out donor sperm was used for all.\n* I'm mad that I put everyone, including myself, through help for 5 years for nothing.\n\nIf you refuse to communicate to people who are your family, what chance do you have in the world of having any close relationships.  People today confuse data and information--your dad not being your bio-dad is data, your parents using donor sperm because of fertility issues is information.  Don't make decisions until you have information not just data.  And for Christ sakes talk to people you call family.", "NTA - SHE made the choice to not bring it up five years ago... SHE decided to judge her mom and resent her, instead of confronting mom and getting all the facts... \n\nIt's regrettable, but it's truly all on her... and she can't get back the last five years, but she CAN try to be more transparent and honest with the family going forward... Yeah, it sucks she drew her own conclusions and that your parents never told you, but it doesn't make this any less of a family, and even if she'd been conceived because your mom cheated, your dad would still be her dad... he raised you all, he loves you all, and genetically we're all related to a metric asston of people... genetics do not make family, love does...", "NTA \n\n>   She\u2019s now furious about the situation and feels like she was robbed of the last five years \n\nUm, well\u2026totally on her. She can be mad at herself all she wants, but at no one else.", "NTA\nImo your sister reaction was unhealthy. She chose sulking over test results, instead of talking to the family about it. So you told her the truth", "NAH I think she did it more out of fear, didn't want to possibly ruin the family", "NAH. Your sister thought she was the result of her mother having an affair and never telling anyone - she moved away and cut ties to avoid creating a family break-up. You are upset because you lost your sister for five years and your parents used a sperm donor to conceive you. Your parents, back when you were conceived, thought they were keeping quiet about it for the best - many heterosexual couples did just that, for years. Family therapy seems indicated. But no one was acting with malice or il-will.", "NTA. She did brought it on herself by not seeking clarification. There are conclusions that are just as plausible (perhaps more so) than \"Mom cheated\". She chose the (arguably) worst possible explanation, and did nothing to prove or disprove it. She and mom probably need some counseling. \n\nI'm not gonna say Mom and Dad are right or wrong by withholding the information. It's a complex situation and I just don't think there's enough info there. Personally, I think they should have revealed the truth to you because there's possible medical and interpersonal consequences that could occur from not knowing.", "Nta", "There are NAH.  There has been hurt and there has been confusion. Time has passed and  everyone has suffered. But now it's time to put everything into perspective, to forgive and understand each other, and to love one another as you all clearly do.", "NTA\n\nShe should have talked to the rest of the family before she just cut everybody off, especially you and your brother.  Even if it was true that your mom had cheated, you and your brother didn't have any control over that, and that is important information that you deserved to know also instead of her just keeping it secret.  Weird situation but ultimately she did bring this on herself.", "Nta. There's no excuse for her actions. She stole the last five years of good family relationships from herself and from everyone else in the family. \n\nI do think your parents are irresponsible for leaving it this long. But when confronted they were honest and it's no one's fault but her own that she chose to run with her less than generous assumption", "Yeah, sorry sis, but welcome to the consequences of your own actions. There are so many possible explanations that just deciding \"mom must be a dirty cheater\" and removing yourself without any conversation or explanation is just... wild. And then to be mad that you've been removed for that time... Ya'll even asked and she lied!! Like... sorry hun, but you did it to yourself.\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit; Also, if mom was a cheater or something nefarious was going on Sis just... ditched her siblings. Found out this news that's so big she had to start a whole new life for herself... but it's fine that her siblings are still being lied to? Wtf. Her logic just doesn't track at all.", "NTA. My generation did a disservice to your generation by not teaching our kids to talk out problems and concerns. Somehow we failed there. I do see a generational divide in communication styles. Not sure why people wanna pull the trigger on typically healthy family relations instead of talking tho.", "NTA, you are right.  She could have asked about the results.  She made assumptions. She chose to alienate herself due to those incorrect assumptions FOR FIVE YEARS.", "Definitely NTA, she made the choice to cut you all off for next 5 years based off her own assumptions", "NTA. She not only choose to do what she did, but she also choose to  never told you anything she knew.  And now she has the audacity to cry that \"she's been robbed of the last five years\". She did that. She robber her parents and siblings of these 5 years. Yet somehow the performs the mental gymnastics to make it like she is the victim. Despicable!", "Your parents messed up this one. This is all on them. Your sister could have blown it wide open, and what if it was affairs? Then, the whole family would be a mess. Your sister, being the oldest, honestly puts you, your brother, and your dad ahead of her own mental health for this one. The fact that you don't aee it this way baffles me and makes me feel even worse for her as you do not understand the trauma this can have on a person. She knew if she kept around, yall, she could never keep it quiet, and she would always be miserable around your mom and dad.", "YTA. Your parents hid your story from you and your siblings, and your reaction is to get angry with your sister for making bad assumptions?", "NAH. This is all your parents\u2019 fault. Once DNA tests were at Target and being marketed as stocking stuffers, they should have known this was not a viable plan. \n\nTo your sister, she was trapped in an impossible situation and didn\u2019t know what to do. Avoiding everyone let her put off blowing up the family and maybe losing her dad forever, or actively deceiving everyone. There are definitely families where the father has cut kids out after learning about paternity fraud\u2026.she must have been so scared of being rejected in that way.", "NTA, but your parents are wild as hell for this. You all should have been told years ago - this is actually important info for medical reasons. Next time you go to the doctor make sure to update your family history stuff to note you do not know your biological father\u2019s.\n\nI don\u2019t think your sister should have assumed anything, but honestly she shouldn\u2019t have ever been put in this situation in the first place.\n\nHer anger towards your parents is justified.", "NTA, but neither is your sister. Finding out something like that can really do a number on someone. Your parents are the real AHs. They should have been honest in the new modern age of DNA kits.", "I mean this is why it's encouraged to tell children about their origins when they're very young, so they grow up with the knowledge. It prevents all this drama.\n\nWhile I think your sister should've said something when  she found out, your parents are a-holes to all of you for keeping it a secret. That's a huge revelation and you at least needed to know that you don't share the same medical history with your dad.\n\nI'm gonna go with ESH, but your parents are the bigger a-holes.", "NTA. She created the entire situation in her head. Simply asking mom about it 5 years ago could have saved a lot of time and heartache. Yes, it would have been a shock, but she wouldn't be going about thinking mom cheated. And no matter what, she shouldn't have cut you out.", "NTA but this is part of why people shouldn\u2019t keep secrets about their kids\u2019 genetic origins without some really damn good reason.", "NTA. And your sister is only a little TA in that you're correct that she should have confronted your parents and not cut y'all off after jumping to conclusions. Otherwise, she was incredibly stressed, shocked, and saddened by this lie that your father perpetuated. Your father should have been straight with you from the beginning. The idea that \"genetics makes a family\" is one that needs to go away along with racism and homophobia from the last century. Your parents created a clusterfork that unfortunately has caused harm to your sister, brother, and you. Family therapy for everyone!\n\nI hope you can move past all this and forgive your sister and your parents and still have a good relationship with them.", "ESH\nMostly your parents to be honest. They should\u2019ve always been honest about the fact that you three were donor conceived.\nGrowing up with that knowledge (not to mention the benefit of knowing medical history) is far less damaging than it being kept a secret until it\u2019s not. \n\nYou kinda suck, why not have some empathy Igor your sister? I can\u2019t imagine the huge rush of emotions after finding out.\n\nYour sis slightly sucks too, yes a conversation would\u2019ve cleared things up. But I can understand her reluctance to confront who she thinks is cheating and possibly hurting Dad in the process. \n\nHowever, I do wonder if your parents would\u2019ve come clean to her or if they would\u2019ve tried to continue to hide it since they said they were adamant about not telling you for decades. \n\nAgain, I think your parents are the biggest assholes in this situation, which also only further shows why donor conceived people deserve the truth growing up.", "You cut her off after finding out she was heartbroken because ALL of you had basically been lied to?\n\nYour parents had their reasons for keeping the secret. But, the secret itself destroyed your sister's faith in her family.\n\n I can't see me being upset with my sister for filling in the blanks with incorrect information after we'd all been lied to. All I see is someone who made a mistake because lies manipulated everyone.\n\nAt any rate, NAH. (If my father wasn't actually my biological father, I'd prefer not to know, frankly. I identify as his daughter and it would be devastating to find out my truth is a big lie. Just sayin', I feel sorry for your sister - not angry with her.)", "Yes, you are the sort of the asshole for telling her that it is her own fault\u2026 \n\ncome on, this is your parents 100%, she was probably dying inside\u2026 What the actual ______?!!!? And she was nice enough to not disrupt the whole family dynamic and just excused herself because\u2026 mental breakdown existential crisis best to just process things in your own. Imagine finding out your reality is not what you think\u2026", "Mild YTA. Yes your sister reacted strongly, but it is not her fault that your parents failed to be honest with all of you kids about their genetic parentage. You sister made a perfectly reasonable assumption about the information she was given by the genetic tests. If you had checked your test results (not that you should have) you all might have gotten the truth 5 years ago. If she needs to continue to be angry with your folks, that's between her and them, not you.", "NTA\n\nWhen I think of the probable shock and confusion that your sister must have experienced, my heart goes out to her. Just imagine finding out you have no genetic relation to one of your parents. Mind blowing, right? \n\nBut she jumped to a lot of conclusions without much fact. Sounds like so much could have been avoided just by getting the true facts. Because assuming, really is just making up your own facts.", "Genetic tests results can have some VERY big consequences on families.  You have lived though it.\n\nWere your parents aware of your sister's genetic test five yrs ago?  If they were,  they should have opened up.  If she did it secretly then she is the reason for losing five yrs.\n\nSome people go the therapy to help them process unexpected results.  Did your sister do this?  Ideally, a counselor would have told her to talk to you mother to get answers about the result of the test.\n\nThe reality is that your sister made an assumption about your parents marriage and fidelity.  Her assumption was wrong.  As a consequence she lost five years with you, your brother and her mother.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. She made her own conclusions on something she should have sat down with your parents with and had that hard conversation. She overreacted and basically lost 5 years as a family... and is now realising her actions have major consequences.", "NTA. She should have communicated her concerns and not isolated herself from her family. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but her own, your parents could have disclosed the information sooner but did so as soon as your brother voiced his concerns. I hope your relationships improve, at this point she should take the L and work on moving forward.", "NTA. She seems to lack the maturity to handle her emotions.", "NTA. Your sister is really stupid. She should have just told them", "NTA your right. Instead of having an hard adult conversation your sister ran away. She should have came clean with what was going on and been honest. She can\u2019t be mad at anyone but herself.", "soft NAH, you could've handled it better but it indeed was her own fault. If she raised her hand to ask wtf was happening, it would've been different.

There are so many people who put such emphasis on blood relations, why? Your family is who loves you and is there for you. My dad who raised me is my dad, the guy who biologically fathered me is not (in my heart, I mean). \n\nI think she made her choices and has to face the repercussions of it, that is the truth of it.", "She did this to herself. NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour sister cut off everyone without bothering to clue anyone in, that is on her. It doesn't matter why she did it, that was her decision and something she has to live with. \n\nIt certainly had nothing to do with you or your brother, so her decision to cut you two off makes no sense at all. \n\nAnd those 5 years are fully on her, so good for you for not playing in to even more of her drama- she uprooted her life over genetic testing without talking to anyone, and now wants to create more drama but centering her own suffering over \\*checks notes\\* her own decisions.", "See what happens when you jump to conclusions", "NTA she played stupid games and won stupid prizes. And for the record a simple search would have told her those test are not 100% perfect. They do get messed up via human error sometimes in the lab.  That should have given her enough sense to say something to your parents.", "ESH.\n\nYou and your brother most likely weren't \"punished\". That seems more like an attempt of protecting herself from possible rejection by doing the rejecting first.\n\nYou are right to be unimpressed by her behaviour, but have a little empathy for how other people deal with traumatic reveals.", "NTA, and I'm not sure if your sister is either. Someone very close to me has been going through an NPE situation, instigated by unexpected results from a genetic ancestry service. It is a delicate and precarious situation. It's clear in retrospect that there were multiple possible explanations for your sister's unexpected results, and she should have been more thorough. But there is not always a guidebook for these things. It took over a month of looking into this stuff for me to even learn the phrase \"NPE\" and figure out how to describe and manage the situation.\n\nPut yourself in your sister's shoes. She (incorrectly, but understandably) came to the conclusion that she was conceived from an affair. I'm not her, so I don't know all her reasoning behind alienating herself from the family, but I wonder if an aspect of it was protecting the integrity of the family. Maybe she didn't want her parents to divorce over it and for her other family members to blame *her* for the fallout. Even if her only motivation was resentment towards your mother and the entire situation, I can understand that too. It is absolutely harrowing and disorienting and isolating to come to believe you were conceived as the result of an affair. Even if you aren't *certain* that is the explanation, do you risk asking your parents about it and leading them to divorce? And blaming you? Like I said, this is a tricky and delicate situation. It seems she did what she did to protect herself and, possibly, the rest of her family.\n\nThe people I primarily blame are your parents. At the time they conceived y'all, there could have been no expectation that it would be likely for you to discover the truth on your own, so I can understand their secrecy--thought I don't condone it. However, genetic ancestry services have become cheaper, more accessible, and more popular over the past two decades. At this point, they should have *already* told all of you the truth before any of you found out on your own. Not to mention the possibility of genetic disorders you could have inherited from your genetic fathers. You are all adults now, and that's health information you should have been told so you can manage it yourselves!\n\nIt is fair to feel angry at your sister. It *sucks* for a sibling to stop talking to you without explanation. But I hope you can also put yourself in her shoes. I'm glad your brother was open when he got these unexpected results--but understand that not everyone feels the security to bring what *could be* terrible family secrets into the light.", "Nah. It\u2019s big news to know, and I don\u2019t blame her for reacting the way she did. I also don\u2019t blame you for reacting the way you did.", "NTA - i'm an experienced amateur genealogist and you sister fucked up here. It sounds like she might've done one of those tests that you buy at a pharmacy instead of doing a DTC autosomal test like ancestry/23andme/FTDNA/MyHeritage - and when someone does a DNA test for genealogy, they should **always** disclose why they are doing it. If she wants to be the family genealogist, she should expect there to be NPEs/unexpected results - she didn't know why things didn't match and she is lucky that it is the best of the options. She should've built up the courage to ask your parents about it.\n\n\nShe's the reason she lost the last five years - it's a good thing nothing bad happened in that time.\n\n\nHowever - your parents should've told you guys about this much earlier - they know that DNA tests are out there, they should reveal it. Bare minimum just so you give the correct family medical history to your doctors!", "NTA. She took half a story and blew up her relationship with the family, that is on her and her alone.", "NAH\n\nYour sister didn't want to destroy your family. So she moved and reduced contact. By not confirming the info with either parent, she could justify not saying anything.\n\nOf course, being abruptly cut from someone's life, hurts.", "She chose to make assumptions and not communicate. That is what happens. I mean your parents should have told you all at some point but at the same time when she found out she should have had a conversation.   \n\n\nCommunication would help so many of lives problems. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour sister cut you off. End of story. Her feeling alone all that time was completely her own doing. Instead of talking to anyone, she just made up her facts about what happened and left. She hurt your, your brother, and her parents. Mainly her mother. \n\nWhile you may feel a certain way about your genetic history, it doesn't your family one bit. Your dad is and always will be your dad. While you kids may feel some pain because you weren't told the truth, I would not stress to much on that. As long as they treated you like you were theirs, you were. \n\nYou were right about your sister, she made her own choices, ones that did not even make sense. She cut you and your brother off, because she though your mom cheated? \n\nShe only has herself to blame.", "INFO: Why didn\u2019t you check on your sister in person if you knew she was in a bad state and hadn\u2019t answered for 3 days?", "NTA, she robbed herself of 5 years. It happens, she will get over it or she won\u2019t but it has nothing to do with anyone else but her.", "I believe she acted more fearfully, not wanting to perhaps damage the family.", ">Your brother did exactly what your sister SHOULD have done\n\nYes, this is how I feel. They basically ran into exactly the same problem, which was that Dad's parents were immigrants from a very specific region of the world without a lot of genetic variance, but that region wasn't showing up at all in the DNA test. For my sister, this was the cause of her investigating further by secretly comparing our DNA. For our brother, this prompted him to ask, \"hey Mom and Dad, what's the deal with this weird result?\" \n\nThey had exactly the same situation, and his response was so reasonable, while hers was so bizarre and difficult to understand. I just can't square it.", "Yeah, the parents are by far the biggest AH here. I'm transferring a donor embryo later this month, and if I'm successful, there's no universe in which she won't know the truth of her conception story, in an age appropriate way, from the very start. The sister could have handled it better, for sure, but the parents did these kids a huge disservice by lying to them for all these years.", "She could have asked about the results. She made assumptions.", "I actually admire that she didn't inflict pain on anyone else while hers festered internally. I'd never tell my mom that I suspected I am her affair baby.\n\nThis is a mess. But, its not amess because OP's sister started a lie. Her folks did.", "Regarding the point that it's strange I didn't put two and two together, that's completely fair! To be honest, I thought it was weird that she was demanding I do this novelty genetics test, but after I gave her the sample, I didn't really think about it any further. Ancestry doesn't really interest me, so I thought she had just found a new hyperfocus on a hobby she found interesting, and I never bothered following up on it.\n\nBy the time she got the new job a few months later, it didn't even occur to me to connect it with that moment. We all have been puzzled about the emotional distance she put into place with all of us, and we tried to broach it multiple times over the years. She refused to acknowledge it, told us we were wrong about it happening, and then would shut down the conversation. It's something the rest of us talked about extensively over the years, and Mom was devastated that she seemed to be the only one fully put on no-contact.", ">Did you ever mention the DNA test to either parent?\n\nI didn't. It was such a seemingly unimportant moment to me at the time that it never came up. Now I really, really wish I'd mentioned it, because my parents likely would have been able to head it off if they knew she was doing genetic tests.", "Time has passed and everyone has suffered. But now it's time to put everything into perspective,", "The sister doesn\u2019t deserve to just be welcomed back with open arms. She acted completely irrationally and ruined her relationship with her family, just because she had zero critical thinking skills.", "This is the best way to describe the scenario!", "really, it's on the parents. they should have been upfront with the kids from the beginning; that's been the conventional advice for parents who have children via donors for a long time now.\n\nOP's sister unfortunately (but understandably, imho) jumped to conclusions and made some rash decisions as a result. but that stems from the parents' choice to be dishonest with the kids.", "NTA. You\u2019re right. Your parents suck on multiple levels,", "The sister is 100% an asshole, as are the parents. Running away like a little girl only made the entire thing worse, she inflicted way more pain on her family than necessary. She broke up the family, and now she looks like an idiot.", ">I do think your parents are irresponsible for leaving it this long. But when confronted they were honest\n\nYes, this is one of the things I'm getting most hung up on. My parents were dishonest with us about our biological parentage for our whole lives, which I don't feel great about. But the second they were questioned about it, they instantly came clean. \n\nMeanwhile, my dad, brother and I constantly asked my sister what was going on, if she was upset with us, etc., and she would deny-deny-deny. She even claimed she hadn't cut off Mom, and just wasn't available when she happened to call, and that it was a coincidence that she always had to go when Dad tried to put Mom on the phone. Honestly, the confusion and mystery around the whole situation was *just* as hurtful as her removing us from her life in the first place.\n\nMy thinking here is: Mom and Dad screwed up, and they made a bad decision in deciding not to proactively disclose how we were conceived. But they were honest and communicative as soon as they were asked. Meanwhile, my sister lied to us repeatedly when directly asked about the situation. \n\nI can completely empathize with her feelings of hurt and confusion, but when it comes to her decision to essentially run away, I can't get past my frustration with her that she would clam up and cut us out of her lives rather than have a hard conversation.", "But why not just go to the mother (who clearly would already know if she\u2019d had an affair, so that wouldn\u2019t have blown anything wide open) and say, \u201cexplain this to me\u201d. If she refused or had, in fact, had an affair then sister could have done the same disappearing act if she wanted to. By not even giving her own mother the tiniest benefit of the doubt, she lost 5 years with her family. Such a waste.", "Thank you for this. This has given me a lot to think about.", "If my sister found out a secret that involved me, and chose to move away and keep it a secret instead of telling me...\n\nWell, now there are three people the lied to me and betrayed my trust.\n\nEdit: And if it was affairs, you're a super asshole if you hide that betrayal. So it's just betrayal on top of betrayal.", "Yeah. She was a huge dumbass in her decision making. Parents aren't blameless but they didn't ghost the family for 5 years on assumptions.", ">You cut her off after finding out she was heartbroken because ALL of you had basically been lied to?\n\nTo be clear, I didn't cut off my sister. In fact, I'm hoping all this coming to light may mean we can rebuild our relationship. I very much want to be in her life. The asshole-ish thing I did here was to tell her that she needs to take responsibility for her choice to move away and remove us all from her life. But I didn't interrupt her, yell at her, hang up on her, or remove her access to my life. I was just extremely blunt with my own feelings, perhaps without being as gentle as I could have been.", "sister who is a grown women also made the choice to act childish and just move away and cut of her siblings who did nothing to her, even if the affair situation was true, she didn\u2019t have to cut the siblings off", "sister could have simply asked, just like the bother did.", ">Were your parents aware of your sister's genetic test five yrs ago? \n\nNo, she intentionally withheld it from them, and the test she had me do was such a non-event to me at the time that it just never came up. (Kicking myself for that now.)", "I never mentioned the genetics test to my parents. It was a few months after that happened that my sister moved away, and that moment didn't register to me at all as a significant memory.\n\nIn my telling of the story in less than 3,000 characters, the cause and effect is clear, but at the time, while I hadn't exactly fully forgotten the genetics test when my sister left, it wasn't top of mind, and it wouldn't have occurred to me to mention it to anyone as something significant. My sister and I interacted very frequently at the time, so the weird moment with the test was lost in the noise of many, many other interactions.\n\nIf she had picked up and moved the week after the test, I probably could have made a connection that they might be related, but it literally didn't occur to me until my sister explained what had actually happened just recently.", "All great questions, and I have no idea. I still don't understand why she needed to get away from me and my brother, even if she was angry at my mother and confused about her relationship with my father. \n\nI think it's perhaps because she was so convinced that my brother and I were both my dad's biological children. (By coincidence, my brother and I both look a lot like my dad.) But even if it hurt to be near us, it just feels like she was punishing us for something that wasn't our fault.\n\nSome comments here are prompting me to try to understand how hurtful this time must have been from her perspective. I'm still struggling, but I'm really hoping she can try to be more open with me going forward.", "But by doing so she didn\u2019t make things anything better. They had to sit down and have an open discussion about it to be honest. \n\nBut I still don\u2019t think OP is an AH for having reacted the way they did as well, they\u2019re allowed to feel too. :)", "So even without the donor it could have been as simple as your dad being a sneaky adoption - so many different potential answers, jumping to mom being a cheater is quite something", "My mom did a 23 and me and found a son (my half brother) she had to give up for adoption over 50 years ago that she never found due to sealed records.. these DNA tools are fun but can be life altering also.

Plus, you needed to know in case any medical issues were relevant.\n\nThe most common advice i hear among people in adoption (and other forms of family building like yours) is that this information NEEDS to be told early so it can be normalized and not cone out as a shock.", "She's only mad at herself and is having trouble letting go of unfair resentment.\n\nI'm not crazy old, but I am still old enough that I know people who didn't find out they were adopted until they were adults for exactly this reason: kids are stupid and hold things against you in illogical ways.\n\nSome adults, unfortunately, retain that.", "NTA for sure. I don't know how she personally could live without answers to so many questions with only her imagination to spiral. I'd demand answers with the same intensity of Jonah Jameson demanding pictures of Spiderman.", "We donated our embryos & they resulted in 3 boys out in the world.  I hope their parents tell them about us.  And I also hope some day they look for us.  I don't want to be mom they already have one!

She cut off her mother totally, treating her as a disloyal person when really she was just dealing with infertility and her husband\u2019s unwillingness to tell the children about their genetics. She also inflicted the pain of rejection on her siblings, who were clearly blameless even in the scenario she made up in her head. She didn\u2019t blow up the family, but she absolutely inflicted pain on them.", "You think ghosting didn't inflict any pain on them? OP's whole post is about how the older sister hurt her entire family.", ">I actually admire that she didn't inflict pain on anyone else\n\nDid...did you ***READ*** the story??!!\n\nShe inflicted a ***LOT*** of pain on ***EVERYONE*** in the family.  She abruptly stops talking with her mother, suddenly moves across the country and then slowly ghosts her siblings  ***ALL WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION***.\n\nIf she HAD accused her mother of cheating, then the truth would have been out right away and they all could have been helping each other deal with their new reality.\n\nOP is NTA, but sister is a huge AH who committed a life-altering, unforced error that hurt EVERYONE in her family.", "<<I actually admire >>\n\nYou admire that she \"disowned\" her own siblings simply for believing they were only half siblings? NOPE, not admirable.", "She absolutely inflicted pain by becoming at best distant and for the mom completely cut off.", "There's nothing admirable about it. As we have seen, it could have been cleared up so easily and sister could have avoided spending the last 5 years in emotional turmoil. Its plain stupidity. Not cool or something to admire.", "OPs sister created the mess by not just asking lol. She inflicted pain on everyone else. Jesus, imagine admiring that", "I am close to someone going through this exact situation--suspecting they were conceived as the result of an affair.

Why would she cut you two off?", "Head her off or tell all of you the truth? You seem determined that this is all her fault.", "Especially when 2 of their kids showed an interest in DNA testing.  What did they think would happen?", "I think a doner sperm would have not even been in the realm of possibilities at the time, so that left affair. Why she didn't approach her mom we may never know, but whatever the case may be, she bowed out, and the only reason I can figure she did it was to avoid a family imploding.", "5 years is such a long time to just reject everyone, three of which by her scenario did nothing wrong!", "NAH. Your sister probably didn't want to ruin your family and tried to cut herself off in fear of heartbreak, while you missed your sister and got mad.

His dad got around more than they knew.\n\n Ancestry testing also exposed the poorly kept family not so secret but not talked about secret: his dad's father wasn't really his father. Everyone around my husband and his siblings knew; no one bothered to tell the kids. Even their dad kept that information from them.", "My story is very similar to yours, CarterPFly. My Mom was forced by my Grandmother to give up my older, half-brother for adoption because she was 15  and unwed. He was born in a Catholic hospital and all she knew was he went to Catholic parents. She married my Dad one year later and they spent the next 5 years trying every avenue available, at the time, to find him. Essentially,  all doors were closed so they agreed to not tell any of their future children. He found us when I was 36...he's great and I have a wonderful relationship with him and with my niblings. My Mom nearly had a nervous breakdown from the fallout,  though.  This is such a sticky situation. On one hand, I love the genealogy aspect of these tests but I can also see the negative side of information being exposed to people who are not mentally prepared for what they find. My parents have been married 58 years and I have no doubt that my Dad would have raised and treated my brother exactly the same as his bio children but with the advent of cheap genetic tests, the info (likely) would have still come out. There is good and bad in everything, I suppose. The saddest part is that I can now look back and see so many behaviors that resulted from my Grandmother's decision and her relationship with my Mom during my life.", "Yup. My dad found 2 nieces - or rather they found him and his surviving siblings. Turns out that the nieces were conceived as a result of my late uncle's affairs with 2 different women. \n\nBut initially, there was some confusion and my dad wondered if he was the father of one of these women (maybe he hadn't gotten his Ancestry results back yet at that point?). This led to an awkward conversation at my birthday dinner with my parents when my dad decided to break it to me that I might have a half-sibling.\n\nAnyhow, my dad became quite close with the 2 new nieces. He also pressured me to submit my DNA (no thanks) and to meet my new cousins (which didn't really interest me as I'm not all that close with the cousins I've known for all of my life). \n\nSo long story short: Yes, mad stuff!", "OPs sister created the mess by not just asking lol.", "Most likely.  I'd guess that the brother did, too.\n\nBut he ASKED about it and found that there are other explanations.", "No, some of us are aware of things like IVF, children conceived by rape, and women who escaped an abusive partner while pregnant. So we'd ASK FOR THE FACTS before destroying relationships over unexpected DNA results.", "when you \"assume\", you make an \"ass\" of \"u\" and \"me\" both", "Some people would, sure, but not all. Sperm donation, egg donation, things getting mixed up in hospitals, and the adoption of kids by stepparents are all things that happen and could explain this situation. If I found this out and never would have suspected my parents of cheating otherwise, I don't know that I would assume anyone cheated.", "Actually imagine yourself in this situation though. Would you break up your parents marriage out of curiosity? Not saying one way is right or wrong, but it\u2019s definitely a conflicting decision.", "Yes, it 'could' have been cleared up easily, but it just as easily could have led to a divorce, rift in the family, alienation of affair child by father. I don't blame OP's sister for jumping to the worst-case scenario and trying to mitigate fall-out. \n\nThis all could have been cleared up just as easily if the parents just told their children the truth. I'm leaning towards NAH.", "And if instead it was an affair? What then? Parents probably get a divorce and the family unit breaks up.", "In hindsight, it could have been cleared up easily. However, the sister didn't want to blow up the family by accusing her mother of having an affair. It turns out that there was a completely reasonable explanation, but she didn't know that at the time.\n\nHer response *now* is not admirable.

But realistically the sister didn't want to destroy the family with what she thought was the truth of mom cheating. If she had cheated, and dad didn't know, shit would have hit the fan.\n\nThe only AH here are the parents for not coming clean", "Oh come off the high horse\n\nThe parents should have never assumed the kids wouldn't have found out", "She could have tried speaking to her mother in private, and she shouldn't have cut off her siblings.", "How could confronting the suspected cheater - and only the suspected cheater - have broken up the marriage? After all, the cheater would already have known about the cheating", "Mitigate fall out meant cutting herself off from her entire family and hurting them and herself in the process?   \n\n\nThat's not mitigation.", "But I assume that they knew 2 of their 3 kids did a DNA test and they just let it lie there FOR 5 YEARS.", "You said \"dad being a sneaky adoption\", that would not be a logical assumption to explain the test results.  I thought you misunderstood.  I still do.", "Sister is an AH, too, because her actions were extremely hurtful to the entire family and instead of confronting it, she ran away and hid.\n\nI think you are massively devaluating the pain she caused by running away and ghosting everyone but dad WITH NO EXPLANATION.  She couldn't even come up with a convenient lie!\n\nI agree that the parents are AHs because, due to dad's insecurities, they kept this secret.\n\nBut sister is also an AH for making possibly the worst choice based on her (wrong) assumption of the situation.", "Yeah, as someone from an open adoption, I feel really weird about the parent\u2019s reasoning. I know it was a more common sentiment twenty years ago, but at the same time, child psychologists were already recommending being honest and upfront from birth about genetic discrepancies, even in the early 2000s (when I was born)."]}
