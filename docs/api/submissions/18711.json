Keep being that good person.", "NTA.another AITA that could have been resolved by a single, relatively short conversation.\n\nYour brother did exactly what your sister SHOULD have done and now she's probably very upset because she realises how epically fucking stupid her decisions were. No doubt she'll project some of that embarrassment on others and lash out, as is the way when people get owned as badly as this.", "NTA\n\nI understand your sister\u2019s reaction, but she took it all that way on a misunderstanding. \n\nYour parents should have made this known to all of you from the start. These days of easy DNA testing mean that these secrets are usually going to come out, and often badly. \n\nI was adopted, and knew from as early as I can remember. I\u2019m glad I did. I\u2019d hate to find out I\u2019d been lied to for decades. \n\nPeople should just be honest up front about this.  Society puts so much emphasis on \u201cbloodlines\u201d, and people think that is the end-all of being \u201crelated\u201d. Your parents are those who raised you, regardless of where the genes are from.", "NTA.  You\u2019re right.  Your parents suck on multiple levels, but if your sister had actually spoken to either of them five years ago, a lot of pain could have been avoided.", "NTA, I understand why she\u2019d be upset and why she\u2019d come to the conclusion that your mother cheated, but even believing that why would she cut off contact with her siblings, lose contact with her dad? She made those choices herself, she could\u2019ve confronted your mom and found out the truth five years ago, instead she decided to slowly cut off contact with her entire family? For five years? That just seems incredibly irrational to me. \n\nYour parents could (and maybe should) have told you all a lot sooner, sure, although I understand why they didn\u2019t, your dad is your father and those donors are just that, donors. \n\nFeels strange to me though that you never questioned your sister asking you for samples and never giving you results, especially due to the timing of her becoming distant and moving/losing contact, but I guess it wasn\u2019t your responsibility to figure that out. \n\nShe can be upset about losing 5 years with her family that\u2019s fair, but you all lost those 5 years with your sister/daughter too.", "NTA, your sister is horribly bad at communicating.", "Your parents should have told all of you. DNA tests are so common now that only willful blindness could have led to this. \n\n  Did you ever mention the DNA test to either parent?\n\nYour parents are both the AH's here.", "NAH. Your sister probably didn't want to ruin your family and tried to cut herself off in fear of heartbreak, while you missed your sister and got mad. Your family should have a talk with your sister and catch her up.", "NAH but at least one dumbass.\n\nI want to list what happened here:\n\n* OMG, my dad is not my bio-dad.\n* OMG, my sister and I have different bio-dads.\n* That's it, I'm not talking to anyone in the family.\n* I don't talk to anyone in the family for 5 years.\n* My sister and brother do their own testing. Dad is not their bio-dad.\n* Bro and Sis have conversations, and find out donor sperm was used for all.\n* I'm mad that I put everyone, including myself, through help for 5 years for nothing.\n\nIf you refuse to communicate to people who are your family, what chance do you have in the world of having any close relationships.  People today confuse data and information--your dad not being your bio-dad is data, your parents using donor sperm because of fertility issues is information.  Don't make decisions until you have information not just data.  And for Christ sakes talk to people you call family.", "NTA - SHE made the choice to not bring it up five years ago... SHE decided to judge her mom and resent her, instead of confronting mom and getting all the facts... \n\nIt's regrettable, but it's truly all on her... and she can't get back the last five years, but she CAN try to be more transparent and honest with the family going forward... Yeah, it sucks she drew her own conclusions and that your parents never told you, but it doesn't make this any less of a family, and even if she'd been conceived because your mom cheated, your dad would still be her dad... he raised you all, he loves you all, and genetically we're all related to a metric asston of people... genetics do not make family, love does...", "NTA \n\n>   She\u2019s now furious about the situation and feels like she was robbed of the last five years \n\nUm, well\u2026totally on her. She can be mad at herself all she wants, but at no one else.", "NTA\nImo your sister reaction was unhealthy. She chose sulking over test results, instead of talking to the family about it. So you told her the truth", "NAH I think she did it more out of fear, didn't want to possibly ruin the family", "NAH. Your sister thought she was the result of her mother having an affair and never telling anyone - she moved away and cut ties to avoid creating a family break-up. You are upset because you lost your sister for five years and your parents used a sperm donor to conceive you. Your parents, back when you were conceived, thought they were keeping quiet about it for the best - many heterosexual couples did just that, for years. Family therapy seems indicated. But no one was acting with malice or il-will.", "NTA. She did brought it on herself by not seeking clarification. There are conclusions that are just as plausible (perhaps more so) than \"Mom cheated\". She chose the (arguably) worst possible explanation, and did nothing to prove or disprove it. She and mom probably need some counseling. \n\nI'm not gonna say Mom and Dad are right or wrong by withholding the information. It's a complex situation and I just don't think there's enough info there. Personally, I think they should have revealed the truth to you because there's possible medical and interpersonal consequences that could occur from not knowing.", "Nta", "There are NAH.  There has been hurt and there has been confusion. Time has passed and  everyone has suffered. But now it's time to put everything into perspective, to forgive and understand each other, and to love one another as you all clearly do.", "NTA\n\nShe should have talked to the rest of the family before she just cut everybody off, especially you and your brother.  Even if it was true that your mom had cheated, you and your brother didn't have any control over that, and that is important information that you deserved to know also instead of her just keeping it secret.  Weird situation but ultimately she did bring this on herself.", "Nta. There's no excuse for her actions. She stole the last five years of good family relationships from herself and from everyone else in the family. \n\nI do think your parents are irresponsible for leaving it this long. But when confronted they were honest and it's no one's fault but her own that she chose to run with her less than generous assumption", "Yeah, sorry sis, but welcome to the consequences of your own actions. There are so many possible explanations that just deciding \"mom must be a dirty cheater\" and removing yourself without any conversation or explanation is just... wild. And then to be mad that you've been removed for that time... Ya'll even asked and she lied!! Like... sorry hun, but you did it to yourself.\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit; Also, if mom was a cheater or something nefarious was going on Sis just... ditched her siblings. Found out this news that's so big she had to start a whole new life for herself... but it's fine that her siblings are still being lied to? Wtf. Her logic just doesn't track at all.", "NTA. My generation did a disservice to your generation by not teaching our kids to talk out problems and concerns. Somehow we failed there. I do see a generational divide in communication styles. Not sure why people wanna pull the trigger on typically healthy family relations instead of talking tho.", "NTA, you are right.  She could have asked about the results.  She made assumptions. She chose to alienate herself due to those incorrect assumptions FOR FIVE YEARS.", "Definitely NTA, she made the choice to cut you all off for next 5 years based off her own assumptions", "NTA. She not only choose to do what she did, but she also choose to  never told you anything she knew.  And now she has the audacity to cry that \"she's been robbed of the last five years\". She did that. She robber her parents and siblings of these 5 years. Yet somehow the performs the mental gymnastics to make it like she is the victim. Despicable!", "Your parents messed up this one. This is all on them. Your sister could have blown it wide open, and what if it was affairs? Then, the whole family would be a mess. Your sister, being the oldest, honestly puts you, your brother, and your dad ahead of her own mental health for this one. The fact that you don't aee it this way baffles me and makes me feel even worse for her as you do not understand the trauma this can have on a person. She knew if she kept around, yall, she could never keep it quiet, and she would always be miserable around your mom and dad.", "YTA. Your parents hid your story from you and your siblings, and your reaction is to get angry with your sister for making bad assumptions?", "NAH. This is all your parents\u2019 fault. Once DNA tests were at Target and being marketed as stocking stuffers, they should have known this was not a viable plan. \n\nTo your sister, she was trapped in an impossible situation and didn\u2019t know what to do. Avoiding everyone let her put off blowing up the family and maybe losing her dad forever, or actively deceiving everyone. There are definitely families where the father has cut kids out after learning about paternity fraud\u2026.she must have been so scared of being rejected in that way.", "NTA, but your parents are wild as hell for this. You all should have been told years ago - this is actually important info for medical reasons. Next time you go to the doctor make sure to update your family history stuff to note you do not know your biological father\u2019s.\n\nI don\u2019t think your sister should have assumed anything, but honestly she shouldn\u2019t have ever been put in this situation in the first place.\n\nHer anger towards your parents is justified.", "NTA, but neither is your sister. Finding out something like that can really do a number on someone. Your parents are the real AHs. They should have been honest in the new modern age of DNA kits.", "I mean this is why it's encouraged to tell children about their origins when they're very young, so they grow up with the knowledge. It prevents all this drama.\n\nWhile I think your sister should've said something when  she found out, your parents are a-holes to all of you for keeping it a secret. That's a huge revelation and you at least needed to know that you don't share the same medical history with your dad.\n\nI'm gonna go with ESH, but your parents are the bigger a-holes.", "NTA. She created the entire situation in her head. Simply asking mom about it 5 years ago could have saved a lot of time and heartache. Yes, it would have been a shock, but she wouldn't be going about thinking mom cheated. And no matter what, she shouldn't have cut you out.", "NTA but this is part of why people shouldn\u2019t keep secrets about their kids\u2019 genetic origins without some really damn good reason.", "NTA. And your sister is only a little TA in that you're correct that she should have confronted your parents and not cut y'all off after jumping to conclusions. Otherwise, she was incredibly stressed, shocked, and saddened by this lie that your father perpetuated. Your father should have been straight with you from the beginning. The idea that \"genetics makes a family\" is one that needs to go away along with racism and homophobia from the last century. Your parents created a clusterfork that unfortunately has caused harm to your sister, brother, and you. Family therapy for everyone!\n\nI hope you can move past all this and forgive your sister and your parents and still have a good relationship with them.", "ESH\nMostly your parents to be honest. They should\u2019ve always been honest about the fact that you three were donor conceived.\nGrowing up with that knowledge (not to mention the benefit of knowing medical history) is far less damaging than it being kept a secret until it\u2019s not. \n\nYou kinda suck, why not have some empathy Igor your sister? I can\u2019t imagine the huge rush of emotions after finding out.\n\nYour sis slightly sucks too, yes a conversation would\u2019ve cleared things up. But I can understand her reluctance to confront who she thinks is cheating and possibly hurting Dad in the process. \n\nHowever, I do wonder if your parents would\u2019ve come clean to her or if they would\u2019ve tried to continue to hide it since they said they were adamant about not telling you for decades. \n\nAgain, I think your parents are the biggest assholes in this situation, which also only further shows why donor conceived people deserve the truth growing up.", "You cut her off after finding out she was heartbroken because ALL of you had basically been lied to?\n\nYour parents had their reasons for keeping the secret. But, the secret itself destroyed your sister's faith in her family.\n\n I can't see me being upset with my sister for filling in the blanks with incorrect information after we'd all been lied to. All I see is someone who made a mistake because lies manipulated everyone.\n\nAt any rate, NAH. (If my father wasn't actually my biological father, I'd prefer not to know, frankly. I identify as his daughter and it would be devastating to find out my truth is a big lie. Just sayin', I feel sorry for your sister - not angry with her.)", "Yes, you are the sort of the asshole for telling her that it is her own fault\u2026 \n\ncome on, this is your parents 100%, she was probably dying inside\u2026 What the actual ______?!!!? And she was nice enough to not disrupt the whole family dynamic and just excused herself because\u2026 mental breakdown existential crisis best to just process things in your own. Imagine finding out your reality is not what you think\u2026", "Mild YTA. Yes your sister reacted strongly, but it is not her fault that your parents failed to be honest with all of you kids about their genetic parentage. You sister made a perfectly reasonable assumption about the information she was given by the genetic tests. If you had checked your test results (not that you should have) you all might have gotten the truth 5 years ago. If she needs to continue to be angry with your folks, that's between her and them, not you.", "NTA\n\nWhen I think of the probable shock and confusion that your sister must have experienced, my heart goes out to her. Just imagine finding out you have no genetic relation to one of your parents. Mind blowing, right? \n\nBut she jumped to a lot of conclusions without much fact. Sounds like so much could have been avoided just by getting the true facts. Because assuming, really is just making up your own facts.", "Genetic tests results can have some VERY big consequences on families.  You have lived though it.\n\nWere your parents aware of your sister's genetic test five yrs ago?  If they were,  they should have opened up.  If she did it secretly then she is the reason for losing five yrs.\n\nSome people go the therapy to help them process unexpected results.  Did your sister do this?  Ideally, a counselor would have told her to talk to you mother to get answers about the result of the test.\n\nThe reality is that your sister made an assumption about your parents marriage and fidelity.  Her assumption was wrong.  As a consequence she lost five years with you, your brother and her mother.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. She made her own conclusions on something she should have sat down with your parents with and had that hard conversation. She overreacted and basically lost 5 years as a family... and is now realising her actions have major consequences.", "NTA. She should have communicated her concerns and not isolated herself from her family. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but her own, your parents could have disclosed the information sooner but did so as soon as your brother voiced his concerns. I hope your relationships improve, at this point she should take the L and work on moving forward.", "NTA. She seems to lack the maturity to handle her emotions.", "NTA. Your sister is really stupid. She should have just told them", "NTA your right. Instead of having an hard adult conversation your sister ran away. She should have came clean with what was going on and been honest. She can\u2019t be mad at anyone but herself.", "soft NAH, you could've handled it better but it indeed was her own fault. If she raised her hand to ask wtf was happening, it would've been different.

There are so many people who put such emphasis on blood relations, why? Your family is who loves you and is there for you. My dad who raised me is my dad, the guy who biologically fathered me is not (in my heart, I mean). \n\nI think she made her choices and has to face the repercussions of it, that is the truth of it.", "She did this to herself. NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour sister cut off everyone without bothering to clue anyone in, that is on her. It doesn't matter why she did it, that was her decision and something she has to live with. \n\nIt certainly had nothing to do with you or your brother, so her decision to cut you two off makes no sense at all. \n\nAnd those 5 years are fully on her, so good for you for not playing in to even more of her drama- she uprooted her life over genetic testing without talking to anyone, and now wants to create more drama but centering her own suffering over \\*checks notes\\* her own decisions.", "See what happens when you jump to conclusions", "NTA she played stupid games and won stupid prizes. And for the record a simple search would have told her those test are not 100% perfect. They do get messed up via human error sometimes in the lab.  That should have given her enough sense to say something to your parents.", "ESH.\n\nYou and your brother most likely weren't \"punished\". That seems more like an attempt of protecting herself from possible rejection by doing the rejecting first.\n\nYou are right to be unimpressed by her behaviour, but have a little empathy for how other people deal with traumatic reveals.", "NTA, and I'm not sure if your sister is either. Someone very close to me has been going through an NPE situation, instigated by unexpected results from a genetic ancestry service. It is a delicate and precarious situation. It's clear in retrospect that there were multiple possible explanations for your sister's unexpected results, and she should have been more thorough. But there is not always a guidebook for these things. It took over a month of looking into this stuff for me to even learn the phrase \"NPE\" and figure out how to describe and manage the situation.\n\nPut yourself in your sister's shoes. She (incorrectly, but understandably) came to the conclusion that she was conceived from an affair. I'm not her, so I don't know all her reasoning behind alienating herself from the family, but I wonder if an aspect of it was protecting the integrity of the family. Maybe she didn't want her parents to divorce over it and for her other family members to blame *her* for the fallout. Even if her only motivation was resentment towards your mother and the entire situation, I can understand that too. It is absolutely harrowing and disorienting and isolating to come to believe you were conceived as the result of an affair. Even if you aren't *certain* that is the explanation, do you risk asking your parents about it and leading them to divorce? And blaming you? Like I said, this is a tricky and delicate situation. It seems she did what she did to protect herself and, possibly, the rest of her family.\n\nThe people I primarily blame are your parents. At the time they conceived y'all, there could have been no expectation that it would be likely for you to discover the truth on your own, so I can understand their secrecy--thought I don't condone it. However, genetic ancestry services have become cheaper, more accessible, and more popular over the past two decades. At this point, they should have *already* told all of you the truth before any of you found out on your own. Not to mention the possibility of genetic disorders you could have inherited from your genetic fathers. You are all adults now, and that's health information you should have been told so you can manage it yourselves!\n\nIt is fair to feel angry at your sister. It *sucks* for a sibling to stop talking to you without explanation. But I hope you can also put yourself in her shoes. I'm glad your brother was open when he got these unexpected results--but understand that not everyone feels the security to bring what *could be* terrible family secrets into the light.", "Nah.

It sounds like she might've done one of those tests that you buy at a pharmacy instead of doing a DTC autosomal test like ancestry/23andme/FTDNA/MyHeritage - and when someone does a DNA test for genealogy, they should **always** disclose why they are doing it. If she wants to be the family genealogist, she should expect there to be NPEs/unexpected results - she didn't know why things didn't match and she is lucky that it is the best of the options. She should've built up the courage to ask your parents about it.\n\n\nShe's the reason she lost the last five years - it's a good thing nothing bad happened in that time.\n\n\nHowever - your parents should've told you guys about this much earlier - they know that DNA tests are out there, they should reveal it.

They basically ran into exactly the same problem, which was that Dad's parents were immigrants from a very specific region of the world without a lot of genetic variance, but that region wasn't showing up at all in the DNA test. For my sister, this was the cause of her investigating further by secretly comparing our DNA. For our brother, this prompted him to ask, \"hey Mom and Dad, what's the deal with this weird result?\" \n\nThey had exactly the same situation, and his response was so reasonable, while hers was so bizarre and difficult to understand. I just can't square it.", "Yeah, the parents are by far the biggest AH here. I'm transferring a donor embryo later this month, and if I'm successful, there's no universe in which she won't know the truth of her conception story, in an age appropriate way, from the very start. The sister could have handled it better, for sure, but the parents did these kids a huge disservice by lying to them for all these years.", "[removed]", "I actually admire that she didn't inflict pain on anyone else while hers festered internally.

Her folks did.", "Regarding the point that it's strange I didn't put two and two together, that's completely fair! To be honest, I thought it was weird that she was demanding I do this novelty genetics test, but after I gave her the sample, I didn't really think about it any further. Ancestry doesn't really interest me, so I thought she had just found a new hyperfocus on a hobby she found interesting, and I never bothered following up on it.\n\nBy the time she got the new job a few months later, it didn't even occur to me to connect it with that moment. We all have been puzzled about the emotional distance she put into place with all of us, and we tried to broach it multiple times over the years. She refused to acknowledge it, told us we were wrong about it happening, and then would shut down the conversation. It's something the rest of us talked about extensively over the years, and Mom was devastated that she seemed to be the only one fully put on no-contact.", ">Did you ever mention the DNA test to either parent?\n\nI didn't. It was such a seemingly unimportant moment to me at the time that it never came up. Now I really, really wish I'd mentioned it, because my parents likely would have been able to head it off if they knew she was doing genetic tests.", "Time has passed and everyone has suffered.

She broke up the family, and now she looks like an idiot.", ">I do think your parents are irresponsible for leaving it this long. But when confronted they were honest\n\nYes, this is one of the things I'm getting most hung up on. My parents were dishonest with us about our biological parentage for our whole lives, which I don't feel great about. But the second they were questioned about it, they instantly came clean. \n\nMeanwhile, my dad, brother and I constantly asked my sister what was going on, if she was upset with us, etc., and she would deny-deny-deny. She even claimed she hadn't cut off Mom, and just wasn't available when she happened to call, and that it was a coincidence that she always had to go when Dad tried to put Mom on the phone. Honestly, the confusion and mystery around the whole situation was *just* as hurtful as her removing us from her life in the first place.\n\nMy thinking here is: Mom and Dad screwed up, and they made a bad decision in deciding not to proactively disclose how we were conceived. But they were honest and communicative as soon as they were asked. Meanwhile, my sister lied to us repeatedly when directly asked about the situation. \n\nI can completely empathize with her feelings of hurt and confusion, but when it comes to her decision to essentially run away, I can't get past my frustration with her that she would clam up and cut us out of her lives rather than have a hard conversation.", "But why not just go to the mother (who clearly would already know if she\u2019d had an affair, so that wouldn\u2019t have blown anything wide open) and say, \u201cexplain this to me\u201d.

In fact, I'm hoping all this coming to light may mean we can rebuild our relationship. I very much want to be in her life. The asshole-ish thing I did here was to tell her that she needs to take responsibility for her choice to move away and remove us all from her life. But I didn't interrupt her, yell at her, hang up on her, or remove her access to my life. I was just extremely blunt with my own feelings, perhaps without being as gentle as I could have been.", "sister who is a grown women also made the choice to act childish and just move away and cut of her siblings who did nothing to her, even if the affair situation was true, she didn\u2019t have to cut the siblings off", "sister could have simply asked, just like the bother did.", ">Were your parents aware of your sister's genetic test five yrs ago? \n\nNo, she intentionally withheld it from them, and the test she had me do was such a non-event to me at the time that it just never came up.

It was a few months after that happened that my sister moved away, and that moment didn't register to me at all as a significant memory.\n\nIn my telling of the story in less than 3,000 characters, the cause and effect is clear, but at the time, while I hadn't exactly fully forgotten the genetics test when my sister left, it wasn't top of mind, and it wouldn't have occurred to me to mention it to anyone as something significant. My sister and I interacted very frequently at the time, so the weird moment with the test was lost in the noise of many, many other interactions.\n\nIf she had picked up and moved the week after the test, I probably could have made a connection that they might be related, but it literally didn't occur to me until my sister explained what had actually happened just recently.", "All great questions, and I have no idea. I still don't understand why she needed to get away from me and my brother, even if she was angry at my mother and confused about her relationship with my father. \n\nI think it's perhaps because she was so convinced that my brother and I were both my dad's biological children. (By coincidence, my brother and I both look a lot like my dad.) But even if it hurt to be near us, it just feels like she was punishing us for something that wasn't our fault.\n\nSome comments here are prompting me to try to understand how hurtful this time must have been from her perspective. I'm still struggling, but I'm really hoping she can try to be more open with me going forward.", "But by doing so she didn\u2019t make things anything better.

She doesn't have to heal immediately and well enough to talk to you, who she thought was a bio child, and therefore maybe even a \"golden\" child who would always be loved more had dad found out about the affair. Remember. You haven't experienced the hurt of believing your parent cheated on the other parent. And if these were her thoughts, it's not uncommon or unreasonable to go NC. \n\nNow I wouldn't say your reaction to sister was an AH reaction, but it wasn't great. I completely understand it, but it lacks empathy all around. Likely because, as you said, you were hurt by the 5 year break as well. So naturally, you're also unlikely to react perfectly. It happens. We are human. \n\nParents also did nothing wrong. They had children and it seems they never found the right moment to explain their infertility journey. This is super common. There isn't a standard on how to navigate this discussion with children. There's a lot of questioning what is the right age to tell, and it often leads to a blow out like this. It happens. It sucks. But really no one reacted differently than what they'd be expected to act as. \n\nPlease consider all of this. Apologize to your sister for not seeing her side. Don't apologize to her because you really don't have to. That's up to you. But you do need to realize everyone in this situation had different pieces of information and their reactions were on par with the bits of info they had.", "YTA - I don't think the assumption that made was unreasonable. So the situation is just a rough one for everyone. It's abundantly clear she's aware it was incorrect. Nothing is gained from \"I told ya so\"-ing her. It's a selfish and hurtful comment.

Reminding them isn't helpful.   \n\n\nAlso, I'd go so far as to believe they *didn't* speak up to protect you and your brother. The slow fade is incredibly hard. What if it had been cheating? It's easy to have hind sight. But put yourself in that position. Sacrificing yourself is a pretty noble move imo. Find out it wasn't necessary hurts. Deeply.   \n\n\nThe situation sucks.

But now she finds out that she was wrong and she's grieving because of the lie your parents told and how it affected her life, the things she lost. If your parents had been honest from day one none of it would have happened.\n\nLike the situation sucks for everyone, but she's just very hurt right now and needs support and to work through things, I think. I think you have a legitimate grievance that she cut you off, but I also think you could have a bit more empathy for why she reacted like that and it might not have been the right time to blame her. Like if she's upset and trying to talk about how this all feels for her, I don't think that's the right time to bring it up. It's the sort of thing to be brought up separately in a tactful way. More \"hey, I know you were really hurt by what you thought happened and were reacting based on that, but even if mom cheated, our brother and I had nothing to do with that, and it's really hurtful that you cut us off over that and didn't even tell us why\" and less \"it's your own fault for not talking to anyone.\"", "NAH. \n\nAlso, a lot of the comments are in hindsight.

Be careful listening to the people in this thread because it sounds like most of them have never had to be in this situation and it's all too easy for them to judge somebody who is having difficulty making good decisions due to their pain and confusion. What your sister did sucks for the family, sure, but you need to have a sympathetic ear for her and not blame her for feeling alienated because the difficult truth is your parents should have been honest the entire time (or at least earlier) before it got this far - something that can take decades to learn in situations like these. Source: something very similar happened in my family and now that my father has recently passed the family is completely splintered - too little too late. If a child comes to learn that they don't 'belong' to the family the way they thought they were and that it's a SECRET, it is only natural that they internalize what that means and all kinds of psychological ramifications can happen from this as a result - rage, isolation, destroyed relationships, hell it's not impossible that your decision to blame your sister for her irrational behaviour is your own form of rationalization regarding this situation. It sounds like very few people commenting here actually relate to the confusion, the depression, the self-blame and self-isolation that can come from having your home, your safe place, suddenly transform into a realm of existential deception - where one person might reach out to others about it, another might internalize and blame themselves/hate themselves and become lost in never trusting their surroundings. Think of it as a bout of mentall illness, and then ask yourself if the people here blaming your sister, calling her out for being irrational etc. are really approaching this the right way. It sounds to me like she started to identify as the wrecking ball that could destroy your family. Anyone who wants to blame her without allowing her to truly be heard about what it was like for her believing she was the proof that mom was a homewrecker, living her life like the hand grenade that will destroy the people she loves and the secret that keeps them from falling apart... look it's just not as simple as people want it to be, and being irrational is very, very human, and no matter how avoidable her reaction seems this is the price of SILENCE - your family's and then hers as she inherited like families do. You won't find quicker proof of that than in somebody believing that everything good in their family is a lie, so, take it easy on her and let her take the time to approach the truth while reassuring her that the family is real. \\*There can be longstanding psychological and even neurogical rammifications of being suspended in that kind of state for long periods of time, and blaming people for how ill they become is only going to make it worse. I wish you luck and it sounds like you all could come back from this reasonably well if you just try to give up your need to be right about her, and hopefully her need to blame your parents, which will take time because it's their secrecy that initiated her going rogue. While you're at it, spare some understanding for your parents who, while they are actually at fault here, were quite human as well in trying to understand what the right choice was in a situation that only naturally could backfire, but can be survived.

They really should have rethought this when 23 and Me and Ancestry became household names, but no one is eager to have to confess to lying, even for the best purposes. \n\nYou and your brother gave up on your sister too, by your own admission.

I'll probably be downvoted to hell, but here it goes anyway.\n\nYour parents lied to all of you about your background. Your brother did the right thing by confronting your parents. And yes, your sister probably should have done the same. This is what gets me though: Your parents have obviously not fostered a sense of open communication within the family. The fact that your parents kept your own biology a secret from you is pretty outrageous in this day and age. It's not hard to draw the line between being raised by your parents and not having the ability or wherewithal to confront your parents in a situation such as yours and your sister's. \n\nYour sister did overreact. But your Monday morning quarterbacking of her situation isn't going to make anything better for any of you. It's NOT entirely her fault. Your parents are more at fault than anyone else here.

She most likely couldn't comprehend the information and didn't want to destroy her family. You are allowed to be angry but maybe try to see things from her side. Maybe try family therapy. \n\nThe real AH are your parents and they deserve no sympathy whatsoever.

That's quite different than just not being fully biologically related. \n\nAdd on to that that constant contact with her siblings would be difficult as now she had this secret that she believed to be true (as statistics would show, this is common). So all family gathering, or even just sibling get togethers would be consumed by holding in this tragic secret she discovered. \n\nSo yes. Pain was caused. But, again considering statistics, pain was going to be caused no matter what. The way sister went about it, she was the only one estranged. There was no blow out. There was no picking sides. There was no divorce. In her mind, she believed her mother had been unfaithful. You'd think by the time all the kids are in their late teens and 20s, someone would have said something about their infertility to the kids. It was never mentioned. Context would lead to the only logical conclusion being a cheating parent.", "My dad found out in his late twenties that he had a different biological father than he thought.  It created a huge mess and strained relationships, which could have been avoided if everyone had been honest from the start.  To be fair to my grandmother, he was born in the 50's and there was a lot more stigma having a child out of wedlock.  Still, family secrets always seems to come out eventually.  Usually the secret itself is not as bad as the resentment caused by feeling like your loved ones deceived you your whole life.", "Yeah what a dumb plan her parent's had.  Does anybody give a shit about the importance of medical history?  The fact that the dad she knows isn't the sperm donor might matter a whole damn lot medically in the future.

I don't have sympathy for her actions.", "I honestly don't think the parents suck at all. The kids aren't adopted, it was an anonymous sperm donation because they so deeply wanted to be parents. There's no other family they could have had. Their dad is their dad.

Sister's turns out to have had avoidable consequences. But none of them could have known any of that at the time they decided how to proceed.\n\nShe's not a dumbass.

I\u2019m a firm believer in the second for 99% of cases, and in this case it would have solved everything.", "I agree with this. The only AH here are the parents, and even that\u2019s a tiny bit of a stretch. The parents messed up. They should have come clean at a minimum, once everyone was an adult. They could have done even better than that, but coming clean before someone finds out is bare minimum. What did they expect, that no one would ever find out and they\u2019d live happily ever after? It doesn\u2019t sound like there was a plan, and that makes the parents at fault 100% for this. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to blame the person who was tormented for all those years with the thought that she wasn\u2019t her dad\u2019s daughter. She was likely heartbroken and bleeding all over everything and everyone trying to cope with the fact that her childhood was a lie. It\u2019s not fair to blame the person who didn\u2019t want to implode her family with a potential affair. Had the parents reflected at all about why their daughter is low-contact, they would have thought of this reason. It doesn\u2019t sound to me like they reflected on anything when she left. If they did, it clearly wasn\u2019t a reflection of what *they* could have possibly done to cause it, but rather what the daughter could have done to cause it. \n\nThe only way OP is an AH is if OP continues to hold this over older sister\u2019s head.

How did they not think that not telling anything about the donor situation could lead to misunderstanding? How did not link their daughter getting a DNA test with that?  \n\nYour sister has the right to be angry. She jumped to conclusions, but she was working with the information your parents gave her, which was none. You can tell her that you wished she had talked to you and your family, but blaming it on her is useless, counterproductive and unfair.", "You have every right to be frustrated. I've seen several people say she did this to not cause a separation of the family but she's the one who separated the family. She was very selfish here. If she thought what your mom did was so bad she didn't deserve to speak to her then she had no right keeping that awful thing from you and your brother. And if she thought your mom cheated but didn't want anyone to know so no one's lives would be disturbed then she should never have cut off contact.", "This comparison didn\u2019t make sense. You asked your parents a DIRECT question. These DNA results are weird, do you know anything about this? \n\nYou DID NOT ask your sis the same thing. \n\nThey both lied by omission.", "I feel like you are completely justified in your feelings. You sister is not. She made a choice that impacted the entire family, and didn\u2019t even bother to confirm it. That just seems literally insane to me. I also don\u2019t know how your parents withholding this information justifies her actions. She failed to confirm and that\u2019s on her, these people telling you there isn\u2019t an asshole in this situation are as usual riding the family is everything d*ck. Your parents were wrong but they aren\u2019t assholes for it.", "This is the comment that swayed me toward NTA and your sister being T - A. Even if she was trying to protect you guys and carry the cross for the family or whatever, she went out of the way to isolate herself when you guys were begging her to accept the olive branch. She can't really turn around and be mad at any of you over her refusal to do so.", "Your sister is processing a lot of information right now.   She doesn't want to accept that she is at fault.", "Lots of people make this sort of choice because they don't want to ruin other people's relationships. They remove themselves from the situation rather than make a fuss and air out the laundry. Again, I think this was a ridiculous move on her part but who can say how we would react if we found out one of our parents cheated and committed paternity fraud?", "They never should\u2019ve hidden it though. \n\nDonor conceived people have been outspoken about the trauma & harm surrounding late-discovery like this. \n\nThis whole situation could\u2019ve been prevented by the parents in the first place if they were honest.\n\nLove the downvotes though", "Your parents fucked up. If OP\u2019s dad had died of a genetic disorder and no one disclosed to OP that the genetic disorder wouldn\u2019t be a concern to her because of donor sperm used, that would be the same thing and they would have fucked up. However, that\u2019s not what happened. \n\nOP\u2019s parents followed the advice of the medical professionals at the time of the conceptions. Until very recently, the advice was not to disclose this info because it might lead to identity issues. Yes, maybe the parents should have kept up with the times and reevaluated their decision, but it\u2019s not the same thing you went through. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry you had those fears though, and I\u2019m sorry you lost your mom young.", "I somehow managed to comment on the wrong thread .., please ignore me lol", "They're trying to turn this back on you. Ignore them.", "No, those are real DNA tests.", "The family never communicated that fact that they were conceived via donors, this lack of communication probably Carrie\u2019s over in to other areas of the family dynamic. Most likely, the sister lacked the emotional skills to properly process the situation and this cut herself off from the family as a form of coping.", "I mean... It's definitely the most horse hooves assumption, when the real answer is actually zebras.\nUnfortunately, cheating is way more common than such a complicated and expensive family plan.\n\nI'm not saying what the sister did was smart or right. If she'd just dramatically accused her parents of infidelity I'd be sympathetic. And of course, that would have given everyone a chance to clear the air. Even if her assumption had been right, what she did was categorically stupid and cruel", "Ops sister sounds like she spends alot of time here on AITA", "I did Ancestry a few years back, and I was honestly surprised to *only* find one new Uncle, and we kind of already knew about him. My Grandfather was quite the philanderer.\n\nThere\u2019s probably more out there, but they and their people must not have done the test, yet.", "That's amazing, did they reconnect?", "I really dont blame them for not saying anything sooner, tbh. Really I only see the sister at fault here, she made a choice and is upset that she was armed with completely wrong information that led to that choice when she could have easily cleared it up.", "Thank you so much for the gift of life you gave to those couples. I hope someday you're able to meet those boys.", "Well, thanks for replying to me, a person who is using donor gametes to conceive a child, to tell me that you don't think donor conception is a good idea. Glad not being able to have children isn't a big deal for you, since you already have them. Great comment, totally useful and not at all shitty or inconsiderate.", "So, let me get this straight. Because you got everything you wanted out of life and reproduced how you wanted, you now think other people shouldn't try to reproduce if they're struggling? \n\nIf you don't believe in the population growing, you shouldn't have had children. You also shouldn't tell someone clearly struggling with infertility issues and about to use a donor that the donor route \"isn't a good idea in general\"\n\nYou have no idea what they have gone through or what helped them make this decision (a really hard decision to make by the way). This is the most entitled thing I've seen in a while and you can keep your sperm donations, we don't want it", "Yes. I acknowledged that and provided a logical reason as to why that might happen. Because constant contact with the siblings would inevitably lead to either sister constantly keeping a heartbreaking secret or spilling the beans and destroying the family. More of a sparing their feelings type of deal. And while feelings were absolutely hurt, the hurt of a fully broken and destroyed family is often much worse.", "Thank you for saying this, I have another comment urging more compassion and family therapy. I put this on the parents first and foremost, because the sister was simply trying to protect the father, the same way he was supposedly trying to protect his children. But it would\u2019ve been more responsible for them to be honest at an earlier age, which is the best practice in my understanding.", "Only because this is an extremely edge case. Sure, this time it could have been cleaned up easier with a conversation, but if I found out my genetics didn\u2019t match my dad's *or* my sibling's \"we're all secretly donor babies from different donors\" wouldn't be anywhere on my list of guesses. That was a reasonable assumption given the information she had. I don't think she made the best move in response, but she was looking at the probable total destruction of her family if she actually had that conversation. Emotional turmoil was a given at that point, at least she could keep it contained to herself. \n\nThis is entirely on the parents. Consumer genetic testing has been around for like 15 years now, they had to know this was a risk! They should have been honest years ago. Ideally always, but at the very least once this became a possibility. Instead they lied, so now they've got fractured relationships and at least one kid with the identity crisis they were apparently trying to avoid.", "Absolutely. I would have sat the kids down and explained that they were dealing with infertility and had to choose a different route. I would have understood  and continued to love my parents.\n\nLying to your kids about their genetics is rarely the good choice. Knowing your medical history can be quite important for example.", "To avoid this exact situation. If they had just been open and honest, the sister wouldn't have suspected this. If she is an asshole then only towards her siblings. Her parents are the biggest assholes.", "As soon as they can understand words.  My parents told me my dad wasn't my bio dad so early I don't even remember how old I was and it was completely normalized from the start. I am so glad I never had to find out a big secret like that in this way. For the record,  being a dad is not about being the sperm donor. I never felt like a \"half sibling\" or like my dad wasn't my real dad. Even to this day, I have a terrible non speaking relationship with him because he's a bad person (so do half of my siblings who share his dna) but I still think of him as my dad because he is. \n\nChildren are so much smarter and resilient and can understand complicated things like this than people give them credit for.", "I do think children need to be told about their genetic origins, yes. As soon as possible and in an age appropriate way. Just like adopted children deserve to know they are adopted. I also believe this is overwhelmingly the expert advice for parents using donor gametes.", "I agree. Ideally, they should have been told when they were old enough to understand. However, I understand the fear of the relationship changing after the secret is out. My dad was so scared to tell my sister and I that he had been married twice before my mom, he was practically shaking when he told us. The first thing we asked was \u201care there any other kids?\u201d He said no and we said oh who cares then. It ended up fine but he was terrified that we would hate him. I know this isn\u2019t the same as paternity but I understand the fear.", "You tell them early and often, so that they don\u2019t even remember being told, they always just know. This is very very widely known as the best way to handle adoption and donor conception. \n\nIt is ESPECIALLY important to tell donor-conceived kids because there have been some prolific donors in the past and there is a risk that they will unknowingly date their genetic siblings if they don\u2019t know.", "Thank you for the recommendations! I recently found Jacoba Ballard through podcasts on the subject, and I really appreciated her compassionate and level-headed approach. I intend to watch Our Father as well soon.\n\nI will definitely check out the other names you mentioned as well.", "She literally could\u2019ve asked her mom. That\u2019s why there is a lack of sympathy. She made every single choice here without context. Had she actually cared so much about the infidelity she would have told her dad.", "What if she was afraid your parents would divorce in a huge messy situation and you found out you too were the child of an affair? Would that really be the better outcome?", "Because it's a stupid ass decision.\n\nIf there had been decade of betrayal there isn't a marriage to protect.\n\nKeeping quiet about that shit is just another betrayal. Now you're ALSO lying to the victim/s. Perpetuating the ongoing betrayal.\n\nShe only martyred herself in her mind, not in reality. And now that she's realizing there's no martyrdom to be found and could have saved herself the grief by opening her mouth and talking, she's taking it out on people that had no control over her choices or actions instead of admitting that maybe her choices and actions weren't the best.", "I think they are harsh on her demanding immediate forgiveness and back into good grace's. \n\nBut she made a bad choice and has to deal with the hurt feelings from that choice. \n\nShe doesn't seem to understand there are consequences regardless of your good intentions", "* sperm donor\n* temporary separation (WE WERE ON A BREAK!) before reconciliation\n* adoption\n* rape\n* infertility\n* cheating\n\nSis decided a cheating mother was the *only* possible answer and ran with it.

So much pain for no good reason.", "Happens to the best of us!!", "They're classified as novelty products, not medical services, which is why the resulting data isn't protected under data privacy laws, and why 23AndMe is allowed to sell their consumer data.\n\nThey are conducted by lab scientists, but they're not as rigorous as real medical tests, which is why a doctor will make you redo the test through them if you come in with concerning results from one of the novelty DNA companies.

I'd be less enthused about catching up with her.", "How is the sister not an asshole for jumping to conclusions and causing issues inside the family?", "A simple conversation with her mother would have cleared everything up immediately, with no drama.

It's not just data. \n\nThe sister 100% mishandled the situation, but she found out her very DNA was not what she thought it was.

She isn\u2019t a victim, she now just has to face the consequences of being a coward.", "The whole case is fascinating but it also makes me so upset just thinking about having the person who could take all your kids from you in the room while giving birth, which is already such a vulnerable and emotional thing to go through", "I don't think she's still considering it was the right move. More of blaming herself for not making the right decision. An impossible decision, but the wrong one in the long run, as we can see now. But OP's sister now has the guilt of being wrong for doing what she thought was best. Que another internal struggle that sister likely doesn't want to burden everyone else with."]}
