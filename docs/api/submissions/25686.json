At that point it doesn't matter if she's talking about a fantasy version of a celeb living in her own head rent-free, she's blatantly saying she'd cheat on you if someone she was attracted to enough came along and I guarantee you that's not exclusive to celebrities. I feel like she thinks that it shouldn't be \"hurtful\" because she's talking about someone she knows she'll never have a chance with, but that's still definitely a hurtful thing to say, there's nothing to gain from that, all you're doing is telling your partner \"yeah I just settled for you.\" She wants to be treated like a love song but meanwhile she's treating you like a bad break-up track.", "NTA \n\nEveryone is of course allowed to have their crushes, but telling your partner to their face that you would leave them and cheat on them immediately if given that chance is repulsive.", "Ah, my ex 8 years ago said similar shit, in my case there simply was no hope.

She\u2019s now doubling down and invalidating your feelings on it. \n\nYou\u2019ve been dating less than a year, so I\u2019m guessing this might be the first time she\u2019s been held accountable for something she\u2019s done in your relationship to date? If so, her reaction is probably to feel very defensive as she doesn\u2019t know until you see each other what level of upset she has or hasn\u2019t actually caused. \n\nAll you can do is talk about it. Part of being in a relationship is that nobody consciously knows everything that could ever possibly be a boundary and can perfectly communicate that boundary to their partner before it ever gets crossed. In many cases this is exactly how many boundaries get uncovered and then put in place - one of you does or says something that the other person didn\u2019t realise was more of an issue than they would have thought. You discuss and agree what\u2019s within the boundary and you both carry on with that tiny bit more clarity than you had before.", "NTA - my husband and I sometimes discuss our favourite celebrities and who we may have sex with if we had the chance . . . but we know that it would never happen, we know we'd never actually cheat on each other even if the opportunity with our favourite celebrity came up.\n\nBut it sounds like you and your girlfriend aren't quite in a place where you can joke around like that.  It usually takes years of being together, being comfortable and confident with each other first.", "NTA I think it\u2019s upsetting to hear if she was serious about it. It doesn\u2019t matter if the chances are minimal or non existent it\u2019s the fact that if she is serious if she could she would. There is not a single person if presented the opportunity with I would ever cheat on my partner with. Not one person. I don\u2019t believe in this hall pass crap, each to their own and look if partners want to joke about it that\u2019s fine but I\u2019d be upset too the way she\u2019s said it.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid op! And forgive me for saying this but from the way you wrote this, it sounds like it\u2019s also possible she was intentionally angling for a response or testing / poking for a reaction from you \ud83e\udee5 maybe she knows what she\u2019s doing. in any case, y\u2019all should have a talk about it honestly. Say it upsets you and have a talk about why that is. If she sees your discomfort and your vulnerability, and isn\u2019t kind about it or doesn\u2019t care, then it may be a problem. \n\nThe chances of her sleeping with Bruno Mars is slim to none. It\u2019s ok for her to fantasise, but to say it to your face repeatedly when it clearly bothers you, and then trying to invalidate your feelings, that\u2019s not alright. I honestly feel like she did this on purpose and you may want to get to the bottom of why she did it and why she made those comments about cheating. Was she just trying to get your attention? Your jealousy? Provoke a reaction? Or hinting something? \n\nGood luck op. Stand firm on your boundaries and don\u2019t give in to her \u201cupset\u201d. It literally takes zero effort for her to stfu about something that distresses you.", "While a lot of couples have their \"celebrity fantasy lays\" and shouldn't take that stuff to seriously, her specifically saying she would cheat on you when you know you have a history of being cheated on was insensitive and bellow the belt.

My husband and I have our celebrity crush, but we've even talked that through that it doesn't mean you're ever allowed to actually sleep with the person, even if given the one in a billionth chance lol. Adam Driver & Jennifer Lawrence aren't ruining our marriage anytime soon lol.", "Oh come on. \n\nIn every healthy relationship each one has their \"cheat sheet\" ie famous people that they can cheat with but the other one can't get mad about. Even if you don't have a list with written down people, you can tell which these people are. Famous actors, football players, singers etc. The chances of this ever happening is so minimal that it's just a joke between the couple.\n\nYou did overreacted though. That doesn't mean that your feelings are invalid and if this isn't something you guys talked about, it caught you by surprise. \n\nJust talk to her when she gets back and put down your boundaries. But it won't stop her from feeling the way she does about a celebrity. \n\nI'm going with NAH.", "[deleted]", "Lightly ESH, your girlfriend was on a high after the concert, I doubt she thought you would take her euphoria and excitement as remotely serious. This isn\u2019t a minimal chance scenario, it\u2019s a ZERO chance scenario. You did overreact. But you are also allowed to have feelings and be upset. You both need to apologise and go work on your jealousy issues", "JC and I wanna fuck Brad Pitt but that\u2019s never gonna happen. YTA. Grow up.", "I'm leaning towards NAH. Your feelings are valid amd understanding, especially given your past. What she said is not unusual or, likely, even a real problem that could come up. The true issue is communication. When you are ready, reach out to talk about boundaries and both check in on eachother's feelings. Healthy, open communication is vital for a happy, trusting relationship.", "Yep...  YTA..\n\nChill the f out...", "NTA. What if you said the same thing to her about some female performer?", "I don't think you are the ass hole, but I'm sorry to say that I think you might be overthinking this a bit. Maybe there is some other insecurities in the relationship or you guys need to build more trust? I love my husband beyond words, he feels the same. We both had said very similar things to each other about celebrities. I might say something about wanting to get that or whatever, but do I mean it, no. I might think they are super freaking sexy, but I'm not really thinking these things with true intent of wanting it to happen. Even if the opportunity truly presented itself (which he has made jokes with me saying if it ever happened if I said no, I'm crazy lol) I only want my husband. In all reality, he is the sexiest man out there to me. He is so much more than the fake eye candy celebrities that pay a ridiculous amount of money to either get or maintain their sex appeal.", "YTA. There were plenty of other ways to express how you were feeling. Hanging up on your gf is childish. That being said, it was better than saying something you\u2019d later regret. Still, not a good thing to do/", "Yeah, I think you overreacted & maybe took it too personal. Let's look at it another way. She likes & trusted you enough to tell you that. She's in Vegas  & having a helluva good time in an artificial world. Embrace that she felt comfortable enough to share her fantasy with you. You might be a really lucky guy with a great lady who loves you.", "NTA If she knew that joke would bother you as much as it did. You don't need to date people who enjoy making you upset.", "NTA. Wow your gf is dumb. Why would you ever say that you would cheat on your SO to said SO? It\u2019s simply not something that you do, especially if your SO is known to be jealous.", "NTA\n\nEveryone has celebrity crushes but saying that she would 100% cheat on you is crossing the line. Honestly, I\u2019d consider dumping her.", "NTA leave her", "It depends on if she was joking. Just ask her.", "Very light YTA. Clearly you and your gf haven't joked about hall passes. \n\n\"I know the chances of stuff like that are minimal\". No, not minimal. Nonexistent. Your girlfriend is never, NEVER going to have the opportunity to sleep with Bruno Mars. That's the point of hall passes - they're situations that are never going to arise but intended to be fun hypotheticals with your partner. In that sense, you overreacted a tad.", "YTA. It\u2019s called a hall pass. Every relationship has them. She told you hers is Bruno Mars, now you just tell her who you\u2019d use your hall pass with and move on.", " NTA. If she had stopped at saying he was sexy, that would be one thing. But she crossed the line when she flat out said she would leave you and sleep with him.", "NTA. She likely said it intending it as humour, but that is not something that feels good to hear from someone when you don\u2019t already have an established enough relationship with to indulge in that sort of comedy. It takes times to become comfortable enough with trusting each other in a relationship to be able to joke about that sort of thing. My bf of 12yrs and I do, but it took a lot of work to get to the comfy place we are in now. We are only able to joke about it now because we know it\u2019s all in good fun, and not at all serious. I can\u2019t even imagine myself with anyone other then him. Had I heard him make a joke like that when we were fresh though, it would have hurt to hear because I didn\u2019t know him well enough yet, and we had not built up so many years of trust for me to understand that it wasn\u2019t a hint towards him suggesting he would cheat if the right circumstances appeared. I would also never have made a joke like that with him in the beginning for the same reason, I would not have wanted him to get in his head about it either.\n\nUltimately I think she probably wasn\u2019t serious, just floating on a good vibe from the concert experience and gushing about it. But it\u2019s not an excuse, especially if you\u2019ve both discussed struggles with jealousy prior. Your feelings were hurt, and that is valid. Hopefully she can understand why and you guys can move on from this. But if she continues to try to brush it off as an overreaction, and continues to invalidate your feelings though, perhaps a more serious conversation needs to happen.", "Nta - gah why do people even say this crap? No celebrity is ever going to live up to someone's ideal. Plus, unless you are in an open relationship, that's just gross, why would anyone say that to a partner, especially with the relationship history you both have.", "NTA. You aren't overreacting. This isn't something normal people say. This isn't something anyone in a healthy mutually respectful relationship would ever let leave their mouth. Especially because it doesn't even sound like it was said like a joke.", "NTA. That was a really thoughtless thing for her to say, especially with your past history. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d turn it into some bedroom fun by blindfolding her and putting on a Bruno Mars soundtrack \ud83d\ude0e", "NTA. I think she was intentionally messing with you to get a reaction out of you, thinking she could get away with it because of the low probability of her ever banging Bruno Mars and making you feel like some hyper jealous person for being upset about it. \n\nF her for that.", "NTA. My wife and I saw Bruno Mars in Vegas and she said nothing like this before or after the show. Find a new girl, OP.", "NTA.... If you said any of what she said, she'd have had a whole ass fit and demanded an apology. It's not like you just clicked, you provided an excuse and hung up. She's overreacting to the consequences of her actions. When you're ready to discuss it, calmly explain how you know the scenario she described would never happen, she should have realized how disrespectful what she was saying was. And that if you were discussing how much you'd want to bang your favorite celeb, so much you'd be willing to cast her a side, you know for a fact you'd be single, called an AH and would be hearing from any and everyone who is important in her life saying as much. She's the AH", "NTA. Me and my husband have 'celebrity crushes' but neither of us would ever leave each other or be unfaithful if we had the chance. We love each other. Your gf took this out of proportion and I would really reconsider my relationship with her. Especially since she sees this as normal.", "100% NTA. I have a big celeb crush and my husband is aware of it, but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying I\u2019d cheat on him or leave him for this guy - it would be cruel and unnecessary. She needs to understand how hurtful her words were, learn some boundaries and sincerely apologise.", "NTA she just openly admitted to the fact she's ok with cheating. It doesn't matter if it's a celebrity or not. Cheating is never ok", "She was on a \u2018high\u2019 after seeing a brilliant concert but saying those things to her boyfriend was ill-judged and hurtful. NTA.", "NTA.  \n\n\n>she then called and started texting me being upset that I hung up and saying that im overreacting and insisting she did nothing wrong with what she said.\n\nExcept she did. She admitted she would be willing to cheat on your with him if given the chance. She needs to apologize because if sides were flipped you'd be facing possible breakup right now.   \n\n\nYou are not wrong. Nobody in relationship wants to hear from their partner \"I would cheat on you with person A if given chance\" and it can completely ruin the trust in relationship.", "Talk about it next time. Maybe not on the phone but just getting uncomfortable and finding an excuse to leave the convo does nothing.", "Im wondering how young you guys are. That was a cruel statement, entirely unnecessary and likely sowed future seeds of doubt for you. You do need to let her know how her oblivious words hurt you and how you\u2019re thinking about the future with her. How she reacts and what she says will yield what you need to know about her.", "NTA. A little bit of class and respect is not too much to ask.", "NTA, as someone with low self-esteem it would crush me if my husband said something like that and I also would never say something like that, even if I secretly thought it.", "NTA \nShe was probably on that post concert high but saying she would cheat if she could is a low blow.\n\nAlso he is a very sexy man but still", "NTA. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings mate. I would be jealous and upset too if my man said something similar about a female celebrity. How I view it is this; I see someone who is attractive and I think about them romantically and it doesn\u2019t hurt my partner so it stands to reason that they also have these thoughts.", "NTA  She told you essentially that if the opportunity arose with the right person that she would cheat. Anyone who condones cheating for any reason is not someone you want in your life.", "NTA, it's not normal to say something like that (unless you're toxic af).\n\nDon't forget to make it clear that if she cheats you'll dump her ass 'in a heartbeat'", "And if you said the same about a female celebrity...how would she then take it? I am guessing about as good as you are taking it.

There isn\u2019t just a minimal chance they\u2019d hook up, it *will not* happen.

Yes, we were okay talking about it which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with OP, but it\u2019s not like saying you\u2019d sleep with someone you know.\n\nShe got a bit too excited but as OP said, she just saw seemingly her favourite singer perform and was in a tizz. OP hanging up is a bit much and this could have been sorted out with a very quick chat. Mountains out of molehills", "All I can say is if my wife or gf got a chance to shag Bruno Mars, I\u2019d be a real jerk to stand in their way. \n\nThe great thing about celebrity crushes is you generally don\u2019t need to pay up on the bet, it\u2019s wildly unlikely. Very different story if it\u2019s Dave from marketing, who she sees every day, ya know? \n\nTrust me, this isn\u2019t the place to take a hard stand. Tell her she has a free pass for her top five celebs, she can make a laminated card to show them, Friends-style. \n\nEveryone else is off limits. Let her enjoy the fantasy, it costs you almost nothing, it\u2019s a great thought for her, it\u2019ll almost certainly end up with more sex for you, where being a total dick about it is MUCH more likely to cause trouble in your relationship. \n\nPlay it smart, don\u2019t be an insecure fragile baby about something that\u2019s almost certainly never going to happen, you\u2019ll come out way ahead.", "I think every couple should have a theoretical, in-fantasy exception to monogamy who's a celebrity they'll never have a chance with.

That\u2019s OK. You\u2019ll likely never meet a girl who wouldn\u2019t leave you for Bruno Mars, if we are talking reality. At the same time, Bruno Mars will never be that interested in your GF, or if he was, she\u2019s wildly out of your league. That\u2019s just life. I love my wife and want her to be happy. If she would genuinely be happy with someone else and she had that opportunity, id tell her to go for it. Because I want her to be happy. I wouldn\u2019t take her back if it didn\u2019t work out, but I wouldn\u2019t stop her.

Girls have these talks all the time with no real threat of any infidelity. Just a healthy fantasy life.\n\nSecond has noone heard of the Hall Pass list. It's a game and it is stupid but you pick 3-5 celebs you would ditch your life to be with given the opportunity.  But here is the rub you BOTH get to have this fantasy list. You can choose who you would gush over without everyones feelings getting hurt. Maybe it  would be fun to do together and help feel less like she is being disrespectful of your relationship.\n\nAs far as my opinion, she was just on an adrenaline kick and trying to express her joy.  She did so poorly but you have to remember she is not your ex/exs. You can't take whay she says gushing about a celebrity as a threat to your relationship.\n\nNTA but check your emotional baggage.\n\nHanging up on someone because your feelings are hurt doesn't solve anything.
