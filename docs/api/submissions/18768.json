Don't coddle religious zealots.", "NTA. \n\nYou can do whatever you want with your body. His girlfriend didn\u2019t like it? Cool. You\u2019re not here to cater around someone\u2019s religion. It\u2019s not fair that your brother is pinning blame on you. If your hair color is going to hinder what she thinks of you, so be it. Not your problem.", "What denomination is this? \"Be happy with the hair God gave you\" isn't a verse I've ever heard of.\n\nI hope they wash their hair at least.

How about fixing your teeth?\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't get why so many religious people can't spot a difference between their own life choices and the freedom of others to do what they want. It's hair for spaghetti monsters sake. Maybe showing up covered in turned crosses and pentagrams would be slightly offensive but dyed hair? Come on. It's not your fault parts your family and your brothers gf can't respect other peoples choices.", "NTA. It's your hair. If the GF is feeling that insecure, it's not your problem.

They both sound like truly delightful people. Imagine being offended because a person you never met at a party has pink hair? Like how does this delicate flower even exist in the world?\n\nNewsflash, if pink hair was enough for her to not like you, you were never going to have a relationship with her because she\u2019s one of those religious people who managed to miss the whole essence of the scripture which is about being a good person and not a judgemental arsehole.", "NTA. Your hair, your choice.

That is a basic human right and nobody is allowed to tell you they are mad for you showing your individualism.", "NTA. You be a beautiful pink delight.

Drag queens are also permissible, but they're still going to hell.\n\nRed skirts are the Mark of The Harlot\n\nGod loveth a full face of makeup,  provided it looketh natural,  but even a smudge of brightly colored eyeshadow or a bold lip be a sin in his eyes.\n\nSleeveless tops are the first step to whoredom\n\nThou shalt not curl thy God given hair, but accept it exactly as he made it\n\nThou shalt straighten thy God given curly hair, because cleanliness is next to godliness and curly hair is unclean/ messy \n\nA woman may not get a tattoo,  unless it be a small butterfly, flower, or other girly shit in an inconspicuous location, because God is okay with those as of 2013\n\nA man may not get a tattoo on his face, or anything that would be acceptable on a woman\n\nI'll stop now because it literally goes on forever lol", ">and I promise they are not offended that most of society cuts their hair lol\n\nYeah I used to work with a Sikh guy and every time I did something crazy with my hair he was always super complimentary of it. \n\nSure, he'd never do it himself, but he would never be upset at someone else for doing it."]}
