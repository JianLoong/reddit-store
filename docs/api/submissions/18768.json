Since when is this monthly event about a specific person? And what does the color of one's hair have to do with anything? Does the bible say \"thou shall not die your hair\"? Your brother, his gf, some of your family that agree with him, have SERIOUS issues.", "I am trying really hard to think of the passage in the bible thats bans colouring hair and I'm coming up blank. I also cant ever remember hearing about any other religion having a prohibition on it, also coming up blank.  This is nothing to do with religion, this is a controlling uptight idiot using religion as an excuse. NTA", "I never understood the aversion (and, in most cases, obsession) of the fanatically religious to dyed hair. Does it say somewhere in the Bible \"Thou Shalt Not Dye Thy Hair\"?\n\nNTA", "he\u2019s got bad taste in women and a bad case of main character syndrome. nta.", "And I saith unto thee \"thou shalt not use Crazy Color nor Manic Panic\". \"Thou shalt know the beast by her color and the color shall be PINK\".\n\nNTA", "Because of who I am as a person, if I was in OP\u2019s place I\u2019d show up with a full on rainbow mane for the next family gathering. But that\u2019s just me. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nNTA. Sorry to hear that your brother\u2019s partner and your family are so religious that hair dye makes them need a fainting couch and some smelling salts.", "\"I know my girlfriend is super judgmental and how dare you live your life as you see fit given her religious beliefs\" is a really bad take.  \n\n\nI look forward to the day his girlfriend's religious judgment falls on him and he suddenly sees the problem here.", "NTA - I think the OP made the right play. It's obvious the family is exhausting. Setting the benchmark early with the newest zealot is a good way to have them steer clear.", "I grew up in a world (Baptist church in the U.S. Midwest) where dyeing hair even just to cover the grays was considered scandalous. Anything you do to try to make yourself more attractive is a sin ESPECIALLY (and almost exclusively) if you\u2019re female because it means you\u2019re trying to seduce people and tempt them into sinning. Drawing attention to yourself (for girls/women) is very much frowned upon.", "Christian translations remove a lot of the context for the rules of kashrut and kosher.", "I bet at least a few of them dye their hair to cover grey coming in.", "Likely Pentecostal or potentially really strict Southern Baptist.", "I grew up Pentecostal. They don't cut/dye their hair, won't wear makeup, etc. Though they would wear glasses and go to the dentist lol", "Ha ha, this is exactly the \u201cWTF\u201d reaction I was looking for! What is wrong with these weirdos?? At least now OP knows without a doubt that they\u2019re not worth giving them the time of day.", "He\u2019s very invested in what his gf thinks of OP and not at all invested in what OP thinks of GF.  A very uneven introduction.", "I have dyed my hair lilac, dark blue and purple, at the moment it is grey. I am 68.", ">It seems quite a coincidence that just a week before this big event where everyone is going to be you so happen to thunk: hey i haven't dyed my hair in a while let's do that!\n\nPeople who like to dye their hair and haven't done so in a long time typically aren't going to wait until after an important event to do so. \n\nHer family not liking it because of *their* religious beliefs, religious beliefs which say absolutely nothing about dyed hair, may I add, has nothing to do with OP. NTA", "Do you know what subreddit you\u2019re on?", "> NTA, but also, get over your pittly 1st world problems. You're not the center of the universe. Who cares about 1 day with your hair. Move on.\n\nWhy did you come here if you weren't willing to engage civilly with the OP?", "I get shit because I'm prematurely grey and I won't dye it.", "She must be a refugee from the 1920s. Back then, hair dyeing was the rage among flappers, but larger society considered it the practice of \"loose women.\"", "[removed]", "There are many religions that don't allow women to do anything to make themselves more aesthetically pleasing for lack of better terms, they can't cut or dye their hair, can't wear makeup or jewelry, have to wear long skirts or dresses. I didn't think this was very common anymore but the town I work in has a lot of Apostolics, Amish, and Mennonites and it's kinda wild", "Kinda - it's usually wrapped into modesty/not calling extra attention to oneself. But also that's between OP and God and her brother is way out of line here. I've been to plenty of gatherings of fairly stringent people & like often the relative who dresses differently is a green flag that family accepts that folks religious practice comes in different stripes. NTA", "Nearly spat my coffee out then! Well done.", "A rainbow mane would be a double offense. I love it.", "Half the old ladies in my church dyed their hair, or maybe being a Methodist makes you immune to grey hair.", "\"Your hair is like a herd of goats that have come down to graze from Mount Gilead\"\n   --Somewhere in Song of Solomon", "Christian translations remove a lot of the context for the rules of kashrut and kosher. They make a lot more sense when you remember that A) the original Torah was a written down oral history of a culture of people who live in a desert, where not all food is going to be safe to eat in the heat or possible to process safely for consumption, and certain ways of dress will protect you better than others B) Domestic pigs used to attack and eat people sometimes and C) Hygiene in a place with limited water is difficult and requires some sacrifices. The hair thing is kinda iffy on how that's interpreted. The bible also puts things in a different order and rewrites certain passages to bend to the whole Jesus bit, so from a christian perspective it obviously makes a lot less sense, because the cultural context isn't there for christains like it is for jews.", "It's a strange dogma to link to such an old religion, since the dress code in Jesus's era would shock people today and vice versa.", "The cool thing about Sikhs is that they only hold themselves to those standards. Like Jewish people, they expect that the rules they follow are their assigned burden alone and don't apply to anyone else. At least in my experience.", "I love that for you. I truly don't understand why OP'S family has a problem with her hair. I bet most of the women that had a problem with OP'S hair most likely dye their roots. It's very hypocritical of them.", "\"I can't do that, it's against my religion.\"\n\nOk no problem, don't do that then.\n\n\"You can't do that, it's against my religion.\"\n\nNow we've got a fucking problem.\n\nNTA.", "It's okay to dye your hair as long as it's not a color in that damn rainbow", "Absolutely and to go off that, the Latin Bible being translated into the king James Bible also messed up alot of the wording and context. \n\nAnyone using the Bible to justify themselves should educate themselves on their own religious history."]}
