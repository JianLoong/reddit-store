Don't coddle religious zealots.", "NTA. \n\nYou can do whatever you want with your body. His girlfriend didn\u2019t like it? Cool. You\u2019re not here to cater around someone\u2019s religion. It\u2019s not fair that your brother is pinning blame on you. If your hair color is going to hinder what she thinks of you, so be it. Not your problem.", "What denomination is this? \"Be happy with the hair God gave you\" isn't a verse I've ever heard of.\n\nI hope they wash their hair at least. Does wearing glasses mean you are ungrateful for the eyes God gave you? How about fixing your teeth?\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't get why so many religious people can't spot a difference between their own life choices and the freedom of others to do what they want. It's hair for spaghetti monsters sake. Maybe showing up covered in turned crosses and pentagrams would be slightly offensive but dyed hair? Come on. It's not your fault parts your family and your brothers gf can't respect other peoples choices.", "NTA. It's your hair. If the GF is feeling that insecure, it's not your problem. Unless you paraded around saying \"look at my hair!\" you didn't steal her spotlight.", "What's God's position on dyed hair?", "NTA.  But your brother is.  He has no business telling you how to live your life let alone what color to dye your hair. If his girlfriend can't deal with you expressing yourself, that is her -- not your -- problem.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is a huge fucking baby.", "NTA. This is ridiculous. If she wants to judge you for your hair, that\u2019s her problem.", "LOL WTF?\n\nNo, You\u2019re NTA. This is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve heard in awhile. They both sound like truly delightful people. Imagine being offended because a person you never met at a party has pink hair? Like how does this delicate flower even exist in the world?\n\nNewsflash, if pink hair was enough for her to not like you, you were never going to have a relationship with her because she\u2019s one of those religious people who managed to miss the whole essence of the scripture which is about being a good person and not a judgemental arsehole.", "NTA. Your hair, your choice. Not your problem if they have an issue with it.", "NTA as a general rule as long as you are doing no harm, and I don't mean petty people saying you harmed them, then it is still your body your choice. I don't know what this shift in dynamic is where men or even women can take away your sense of body autonomy. That is a basic human right and nobody is allowed to tell you they are mad for you showing your individualism.", "NTA. You be a beautiful pink delight. You have body autonomy \n\nSecond post on here where people\u2019s religious beliefs have cause AH behaviour.\n\nSeriously thinking that they are missing out on some of the basic aspects of Jesus.", "NTA.  It's YOUR hair on YOUR body - you do what you want with it when you want.  And what does hair color have to do with religion???", "NTA \n\nSome people need to get over themselves, why would it even occur to you that something as basic as dyeing your hair would offend them?", "**NTA** \\- Every person has the right to do what they want with their hair.  You don't want to have a relationship with your brother's gf if she is so uptight that the color of someone else's hair makes her uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nEven if you had ESP and could read minds and see the future and all that and somehow mystically knew his gf had a 10 foot religious pole up her butt, it\u2019s your hair and body and no one else\u2019s", "NTA, it's your hair, so your family needs to shut up.
