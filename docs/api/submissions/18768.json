The hair thing is kinda iffy on how that's interpreted. The bible also puts things in a different order and rewrites certain passages to bend to the whole Jesus bit, so from a christian perspective it obviously makes a lot less sense, because the cultural context isn't there for christains like it is for jews.", "It's a strange dogma to link to such an old religion, since the dress code in Jesus's era would shock people today and vice versa.", "The cool thing about Sikhs is that they only hold themselves to those standards.
