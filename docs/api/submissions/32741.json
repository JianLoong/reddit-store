There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut the attitude of 'making a kid feminine' or as if make up or femininity or being gay or whatever it is that you all are scared of is going to ruin your kid, either now or down the road, may end up being the death of him.

What's important is that your son becomes the person he needs to be to be happy.

Your poor kid is probably sooo confused. He just was mimicking mommy and those blender feel nice tbh. Your husband has some serious issues imo, being mad about that is crazy.

Does he have any other toxic beliefs that are likely to cause confusion or harm to your child? \n\n\nThose are all hypotheticals, but to me equally as ridiculous as thinking a boy playing with pretty colours is going to turn out feminine.

Your husband sucks for being an obvious homophobe. You\u2019re okay with it now, but if your kid was 5, you\u2019d feel the same way as your husband. That sucks.\n\nI\u2019m also a 26f mom of a 2 year old. I have a daughter, but I nanny a 2 year old boy. They both love doing makeup with my younger sister. They\u2019re actually both getting makeup for Christmas from her. The boy\u2019s parents are not at all \u201cwary\u201d about this. The boy is having fun, and mimicking adults in his life which is totally natural. Plus, they know you can\u2019t make a kid queer. \n\nYour kid is and will be who he is whether you and your husband support him, or he has to be who he is in secrecy from you both. If he can be himself no matter if that is macho masculine man, feminine queer man, or anywhere in between, and you can support and love him all the same, he will be much happier for it. If he were to end up queer, and you guys continue on your gender norms bullshit, he will not do well. Depression, anxiety, and suicide often plague queer kids with homophobic/transphobic/lgbtq+phobic parents. Not to mention he\u2019ll likely go no contact with you when he moves out. \n\n\nReevaluate your ideals for your son and future children.

What if your son turns out to like feminine things? What if he comes out as gay, bisexual, or Trans? If your husband is seriously this angry over simple things like this, I fear for your son. This doesn't mean that he will be physically abusive, disown him, etc. (which he definitely could). But even just growing up with a father who gets angry over his 2 year old son putting on makeup could be very dangerous to your sons mental health when growing up, especially if he does like feminine things and/or become part of the LGBTQ community.\n\nYou need to sit down and think hard if you want to continue raising your son with this type of person in his life.

They are the exact reason this could be seen as an issue in the first place, talking about the 'sexuality' of a 2 year old is absurd. The kid doesn't even understand what makeup is, they are TWO!

People being scared of their children trying things out is ridiculous", "Yeah it\u2019s concerning that she\u2019s \u201cwary\u201d, they both sound homophobic/transphobic.\n\nEdited: my TBI is messing with me today.", "Yep, she sounds just as homophobic, just that she doesn\u2019t think he can be \u201ccorrupted\u201d or whatever at that age.", "Yeah--\"I tried to force a screen on him, but he just kept *observing human behavior!!*\"", "I suspect is folks who don\u2019t realize that they are two different words.", "I know it doesn't actually matter and I can always tell what they mean but it's such a pet peeve of mine lol", "Dresses are usually self-explanatory on a person of any gender", "What were you trying to say here? That it\u2019s not okay for a person to be curious about makeup if he has a penis?", "A beauty blender is a sponge. He was playing with a sponge.\n\nAnd that is not what the father flipped out about. Explicitly, \"Then told me to stop trying to make our son feminine.\"", "The dad wasn't worried about how it might harm the skin. He literally said it's \"too feminine.\" Please read before you play devil's advocate.", "He absolutely is, when I was a little girl I liked to imitate my mother, she'd put lipstick on me for a laugh. Also, I imitated my grandfather, I'd put on his jacket and pretend I was a  business man. No one scolded me or threw a fit.", "You have to be in a state of complete delusion and disconnection from reality if you think the harm caused by alcohol is comparable to makeup in any way, shape or form.", "You really just compared a child playing with makeup to giving your kid alcohol\u2026", "You are being disingenuous. You know damn well that dad didn\u2019t give a shit about whether the makeup would irritate the boy\u2019s skin.", "And imagine him being able to do his own, and  people telling him his makeup is really good, and him saying \"Thanks! My mom taught me.\"  \n\nOr, on the flip side, him saying \"Thanks! I actually had to learn in secret or else my dad would hit me.\"", "her also being \"wary\".... of what? having the kid mimick their parents is 100x better than having your kid seated in front of a fucking ipad. millenial ass behavior.", "And they are always trying to excuse it with \"but I am so busy!\". But I know fathers and mothers who work 12 hour shifts and still have time to read to their kids or play with them.", "It's less about exposure and more about how makeup tools can be a breeding ground for bacteria. So yeah, coming into contact via touching sometimes and washing your hands eventually, sure. Taking your child's bacteria, shoving it into what's basically an incubator, and then putting that incubator onto your face and directly next to your eyes/nose/mouth? Probably not the best.", "Exactly. My little brother liked wearing my skirts and twirling to \"make a flower\". Now he's a weeb with a bunch of anime girl figurines. It's just stuff, it doesn't affect sexuality or gender like that.", "everyone shitting on the husband needs to shit on OP a bit too- they sound like they\u2019re in the jesus cult and these things will only get worse, especially if the kid has access to the internet already lol\n\nin this situation specifically OP is not TA, but the wording and large scale implications surrounding not wanting the kid to be feminine makes ESH\n\ny\u2019all better prepare for that kid to need therapy", "I\u2019m so weary off of people who don\u2019t know the difference between weary and wary. Or maybe they\u2019re combining wary and leery.", "Yes! I got that vibe as well. She's treading carefully all the time JUST IN CASE she \"creates\" a child that isn't sprouting nornal gender stereotypes.", "They even pat each other on the ass and shower as a group, what's not straight about that?", ">(little shit wore it better than me)\n\nI put a guy friend in one of my dresses once and said the same\ud83e\udd23\n\nTurns out he *likes* wearing dresses. I didn't know til a decade later when his mom told me.", "My main criticism of parents of \u201ciPad kids\u201d (I\u2019m talking about screen-addicted kids who have no interest in anything else, not kids who use it in moderation) is that those parents often seem to lack interest in engaging with their kids. It\u2019s sad. I hope this was just a one-off thing for OP and she\u2019s not handing him the iPad every time he wants her attention and guidance.\n\nAnd like, from a childhood development perspective, isn\u2019t observing and mimicking adults what kids are supposed to do? Again, I\u2019m not a parent, but I do have a degree in anthropology and from what I can tell, that trait in children seems to be biologically ingrained. (even non-human baby animals do it)", "Yeah, the explanation is that they need some airflow on their more private bits \ud83e\udd73", "And with how much he's likely to post (YouTube, tiktok, etc) knowing how to apply makeup if it makes him feel better when he's on camera isn't terrible. I feel I look better in pics when wearing makeup.", "She\u2019s most likely one of those parents who thinks it\u2019s inappropriate to teach elementary school kids that gay people exist because that will make them gay.", "That\u2019s fair. I guess I was considering that this kid has probably sneezed and barfed (maybe at the same time?) directly into her face. But you definitely would go wash up after that.", "Yeah... It's not 100% clear but this definitely feels like one possibility is \"AITA? I thought he was too young for this to make him gay, but maybe husband is right and it's never too early\"", "Oh how I wish it would be something so clever! Based on context clues, I can *almost* guarantee it wasn't that, at least 9 out of 8 times.", "Thats it! I couldn't quite pinpoint what I felt was off about this post"]}
