I\u2019m sorry your children have such terrible parents.", "I'm sorry your mom died and I'm glad you are back in a program.\n\n A 9 year old is too young to have a full understanding of how addiction destroys someone's life and also their relationships, and so discussions about drug addiction must be oriented to the child's age. So I'm not sure what the point of your husband showing your son those pictures as a way for him to avoid the \"wrong woman\". What 9 year old is motivated by future marriage prospects? \n\nI don't really fault your husband for keeping the pictures. He may have lied to you about keeping the pictures, but it sounds like you also lied to him about your relapse during pregnancy #2, up until you \"got caught\". Two wrongs don't make a right, but just as you are motivated to stay sober and learn new techniques for coping with loss, I'm pretty sure his motivations are just to protect his children.  I could see him reasoning that, in the name of protecting his children, he doesn't really care if his actions hurt a woman who lied to him and made decisions that harmed his second child. I know that's tough to hear, but I can't really fault him for that line of reasoning or his motivations, but I still don't think his actions had the intended impact. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, keep up the good work in your program. And, when interacting with your ex, don't focus on whether or not something involves you (your husband showing the pictures of you) but rather keep things focused on whether they help your children. For example, you could've said that while you are glad your husband is having conversations about the dangers of substance abuse, a 9 year old is unlikely to be motivated by the concern of selecting the \"wrong woman\" as a spouse. Similarly, knowing that both your children have been impacted by your substance abuse, you could ask that your husband spend some time on the boy's relationship with each other too. There must be some pamphlets or advice on addiction websites for how to talk to children in an age-appropriate fashion about this subject.", "YTA; I\u2019m just curious though .. the oldest one calls the youngest one the \u201cR\u201d word and you say he had problems but YOU think he\u2019s fine.

Kids in that position automatically fear they\u2019re \u201cbad\u201d like the parent that\u2019s being bashed. In fact, people lose custody when they expose their children to parental adult situations (like showing those photos of you to minor children).
