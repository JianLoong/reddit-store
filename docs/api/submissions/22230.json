For example, you could've said that while you are glad your husband is having conversations about the dangers of substance abuse, a 9 year old is unlikely to be motivated by the concern of selecting the \"wrong woman\" as a spouse.

Very helpful when the parent of your children apparently tries to get clean).  In my country, him having those pictures after repeatedly being asked to delete them wouldn't even be legal. Yes, it was probably right to use them as proof at court, but he still need to delete them while they have copies of it.", "Nah I'm good, it's OK for me to be my own person. Not too worried about how you look at it, we're all entitled to our own opinions right? You do you bud, and I'll do me.\n\nAs for life happiness in general, yeah I find this culture/race war that seems to be trending right now to be super annoying. Everyone is so busy bitching at each other and there is no escape from it, it's in almost very form of media served fresh every day.. Could you imagine if, instead of being dicks to each other over stupid shit, we put that energy into working together as one species? The human race as one! So much wasted potential, and so I do indeed see the world around me as bleak, pointless, and depressing as fuck. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what do I know... I'm just a lowly counter guy. Sellin tires and fixing old junk. Yep....", "I didn\u2019t say drugs. I said meth specifically.

(And let\u2019s be honest if she was doing what that commenter claimed he wouldn\u2019t be doing visits when he has custody) \n\nI get it addict\u2019s can do bad shit but what that commenter was doing was just straight up creating a whole imaginary story because they wanted more reasons to excuse what the dad did. Like you can say you think what he did was okay without that.", "Very fair point. For the sake of the kids, I hope it\u2019s not truthful.", "Totally, that\u2019s a factual statement.  \nMy previous statement still stands.", "DARE programs start in elementary. You get shown pictures and videos of people on drugs and what happens. Dad has full custody and kiddo could\u2019ve asked some sort of question that led to showing the picture. We don\u2019t know what happened. Addiction is terrible. My uncle is in prison for it and we have part custody of his kid and my grandpa has the other part. He\u2019s only 11 and has seen shit and asked stuff. Sometimes honesty is the best policy so that your kid knows wrong from right. This is only mom\u2019s side. The mom that did METH while pregnant.

I definitely don\u2019t have any sympathy not am I sticking up for OP or think it\u2019s okay for anyone to do drugs while pregnant or around kids in the slightest.
