This whole post was nothing but ME ME ME.  You think you deserve an apology for your ex documenting your rock bottom?  You think you need leniency for your actions just because you're in NA/AA?   \n\nClearly, you might be in a 12 step program but you aren't in recovery.  Until you humble yourself and lose the entitled attitude, I don't see this going well for you.\n\nYour ex really should not have shown your child those pictures.  Jeremy is much too young to fully understand and as a result, is hurting his brother.  However, he WAS old enough to see that there was something wrong with Mom.  An age-appropriate conversation would have been better.  Also, I suggest they seek out Al-Anon.\n\nESH", "Uh, wow. No. NTA.\n\nWhat on earth were your ex-husband's intentions here?! First of all, he shouldn't have taken those pictures in the first place. No one should *ever* be shamed and humiliated like that. But furthermore, showing those pictures to your CHILD? And insulting you to your child's face about you being the \"wrong woman?\" Absolutely *not*. I hope your son can learn to have some sensitivity to this issue and someday be properly educated on drug addiction. It sounds like your ex needs some education too, honestly.\n\n\\*EDIT\\*: It sounds like some people in the comments need some education on drug addiction too. Yeah, it's not great that you took drugs while pregnant, but addiction is a disease that we should never blame the addict for.\n\nHas your ex *never* made a mistake? Has he never done *anything* he's ashamed of? (I can answer that right now. He absolutely SHOULD be ashamed of all his actions in this story.)\n\nOP, it is absolutely understandable that you would relapse in a time of grief and stress. I am so sorry you are going through this, and I am so proud of you for getting help. Your ex-husband is BY FAR the asshole here. Not you.", "No he should not have shown your son.

You're downplaying the impact DOING SUBSTANCES WHILE PREGNANT caused your son. You're mad your ex hasn't apologized for taking pictures yet have you apologized for doing what you did? How can he not \"still be upset\" when you literally put your son in danger for selfish reasons. This entire post is about you. \"He's mad at me\" \"He hasn't apologized to me\" \"me me me\". I'm surprised your children weren't taken away.

Someone has to be the adult here, and I hope it will be you.  What your ex did was abusive and wrong.  The conversation needs to be about that.  He can dislike you, but he can't put the kids in the middle, ever.  That means not trashing you in front of the kids, because it's harmful to them.  And you as mom needs to tell Jeremy that he absolutely can't speak about his brother that way, as any mom of a 9 year old might have to do.", "You and your ex are both the AH\u2019s", "NTA. You have every right to be upset at your ex husband for doing that. It was blatantly disrespectful and undermined your son's trust and respect for you. You can't let him treat his younger brother like that though, you HAVE to nip that in the bud or he's going to grow up a bully. \n\nOthers here are bringing up the fact that you relapsed while pregnant. Of course that sucked, but that's not the question being asked.", "Eh ESH\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to show kids these kind of pics especially of their own mom. It could cause trauma for them. Also sounds like your ex-husband did this to be petty and get back at you. Overall not a healthy thing to do to show kids this.\n\nDoing hard drugs on your part wasn\u2019t fair to your kids either. You need to take more accountability/responsibility for your drug habits (12 step recovery is a good start) and the consequences they\u2019ve rendered.", "NTA\n\nMy ex husband is an alcoholic and we share a son. \n\nHe\u2019s done a lot of fucking awful things to me and by extension, our child. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t do something like that in a pink fit. \n\nBecause at the end of the day, shattering the good image of a parent in the eyes of a child is so unbelievably damaging to the child in question, it is unforgivable in my opinion. \n\nJust for the record, in your scenario I am the sober one. I\u2019m only just now comfortable enough to have a few drinks with my friends, five years after we separated. That\u2019s how sober I was. \n\nAddiction is a disease. A disease that hurts everyone around the addict, but a disease nonetheless. You didn\u2019t want to be that person. \n\nHe hurt your child on purpose. \n\nIt was done from a place of malice. He wanted to hurt you and he didn\u2019t give a fuck that the person he was hurting the most was his innocent child. \n\nNTA. Not even close.", "First congrats on beating this.\n\n2nd of all how dare you bring your dead mother into this.

Like others have said, lawyer probably advised him to keep the pictures of you DOING METH WHILE PREGNANT. He's the asshole for bringing the kids into this in a non-helpful way. They don't need to see pictures of their mother in such a state. He should also be showing Jeremy that its wrong to treat his brother (and any other person who may be afflicted with mental disabilities) in such a way, and especially using slurs against him.\n\nAs for why you are the asshole, other than the lack of remorse I'm reading for this post, I've already said it twice, but I'll say it once more, just to hammer down the point. You were DOING METH WHILE PREGNANT.", "Feel lucky he didn't report you. You could have lost custody of both of your children.", "NTA\n\nThis is a close one, but I\u2019m not here to judge your past because I have no reason to believe you haven\u2019t changed. \n\nYour ex is doing irreparable damage to y\u2019all\u2019s son.", "Taking drugs while pregnant always makes you the asshole.

Disarm the bully and he will have no ammunition.\n\nYTA because you did meth while pregnant and now you're mad. I can't comment on the dad. From what you're saying, he did get you to stop using meth. He could have just had your kids taken away and left you in the street. Your kids are safe, you aren't using, they live with you - yeah, you are a very lucky person.", "NTA\n\nYour ex-husband likely did this to alienate Jeremy from you.

What the fuck", "Honestly ESH, he's TA for showing a 9 year old pictures he should have never seen. YTA because those pictures shouldn't exist, the fact that you have any form of custody astounds me.
