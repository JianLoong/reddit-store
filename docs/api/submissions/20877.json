She clearly misses travelling with her mother, but make it clear this life long goal vacation you've spent years planning and saving for is not the right time for her mother joining you. Compromise is the key here. You can both have what you want without anyone losing out if you play this right.", "NTA this isn\u2019t the sort of trip to take your MIL on. Offer a different trip, shorter, less expensive. Maybe a mother-daughter only trip while you and your child stay home so they can recapture that feeling your wife misses so much\u2026but no way would I bring her on this one", "NTA: Especially because you planned this trip.  Nothing is stopping your wife from taking her mom on a trip outside of her planning a trip for her and her mother.  Instead of doing that she's just piggy backing off your idea. \n\nSuggestions:  offer her a weekend you'll watch the little one while her and her mother get to take a trip else where", "NTA at all and this is a hill I would die.", "NTA. Stand your ground. It's time to find out if she's ready to wear big girl panties or go have mommy wipe her arse. Seriously bro, find out sooner rather than later.", "NTA - she can just plan a trip with her mother at a later date.", "NTA and I'd tell her that you aren't stopping her from traveling with her mother and, in fact, think it's a good idea sometimes; it's this one trip in particular that you're saying no on because it's a trip that has special significance to you and it's important to you that it just be the 3 of you.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want any of my in-laws on a trip with my wife and kids either.", "NTA \n\nYou and your child do one trip, your wife and her mother can go do separate trip. \n\nIs she expecting to be in the same room with you, or a separate room? Will she be expecting you to cover her costs? If not, I would be adamant she not room with you and the three of you get alone time without MIL every single day. You meet for breakfast and then an hour in the evening at the hotel. Go on and book excursions for only 3 people.", "NTA. Your wife knows how important this is for you,  she is out of line trying to shoehorn her mother into the experience.  It is very callous.\n\nIs there another one of your family members who would like to go instead of your wife (if she wants to be with her mother)? This trip is too important to allow yourself to be manipulated.", "NTA I know it\u2019s hard but keep your boundaries around the desires for this trip.", "Your wife waited for you to make plans before asking on purpose.", "NTA. If you wanna offer your wife a compromise, tell her you can all go on a trip together at another time.", "NTA but your wife is, she'll have to pick another trip to share with her mother if it's really that important to her.", "NTA \n\nMIL will change the entire dynamic. \n\nIt\u2019s not a small ask! \n\nTell your wife to plan a separate trip. And also MIL can travel with her friends", "NTA... Your wife is being inconsiderate.  You likely have precious few vacation days, the purpose of a vacation is to refresh your mind and body so you are able to return to work in better shape. Taking your MIL changes the family dynamic an drains your energy. This is a trip you have expectations for, this is not a parent caregiving holiday.\n\nTell your wife that she should plan the next vacation. One that MIL could join you on. Preferably a resort where you can meet for meals and do some independent activities", "Don\u2019t do it just to please your wife you will end up regretting it. You are investing too much time and money into this trip to let MIL ruin it. And she will.", "NAH. Your wife is close to her mother, but you certainly have reasons to want to do this trip without her. \n\nSay no to her going on this trip. It's more about your family anyway.\n\nEncourage your wife to go on trips with her mother at another time. Not all family members go on every trip.", "NTA, Is it possible she could join you for you for the last week only or can you offer your wife the opportunity to do a trip once a year with her mom?", "NAH - It sounds like you all need a vacation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But too late for this trip\u201d", "NTA I agree with others who said she can't come on this trip, but maybe your wife can plan a different trip with her. MIL should also look for travel groups, there are tons of trips for people traveling alone, especially over the age of 50. She may meet some nice people to stay friends with and travel with in the future.", "NTA.\n\nYou do not want this trip to be beset with the tension of having to suppress your feelings of discomfort being around your MIL.\n\nIf she came, she would destroy the trip completely.\n\nYou probably should have had a serious talk with your wife about how much you dislike your MIL, so that your wife knows better than to try to push her mother on you.\n\nAnd train yourself also to be instantly alerted when MIL is mentioned, so that from now on you're ready to push back with maximum prejudice (as they say in law). It's harder to keep MIL out of vacation plans if you were noncommittal at first rather than intensely opposed.\n\nYou probably can't ban MIL from your life forever, but you surely want a vacation to be off limits.\n\nWhy not encourage your wife to take her own trip with her mother? You can stay home, though any MIL who's a pro will immediately seize on that as a chance to pick a fight.", "Yes, this exactly! I would say that you would like this trip to just be your family but to ensure your wife feels heard, encourage her to plan a trip (even a short/close one if $$$ or time is an issue) with her mother and maybe bring your daughter or even you too. Whilst it might not be exactly what she wanted, at least you listened to her and come up with some other options.", "This all day everyday. NTA, hill to die a thousand deaths on over and over and over again. You can trust your MIL to ruin your trip simply by being there. Schedule a couples counseling session specifically for this so it is drilled into her head how inappropriate her request is."]}
