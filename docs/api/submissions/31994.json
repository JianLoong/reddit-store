His mother and I have been divorced for 5 years now and we have shared custody of him.\n\nDoctor said that is a minor injury that will heal in a week or so with just a splint, but she stormed out saying that it would need up to 3 weeks of healing (she is not a doctor). Now she is clamming that my kid can't come to the trip that I planned two months ahead, because of this accident. She even asked the doctor to give her a letter saying that he can't go, and the doctor denied it saying she wouldn't lie on the diagnosis.\n\nSince I have the immigration rights of him, I can travel in-and-out the country with him and this will be his first trip; he is more than excited to go since he has never been in an airplane before. She and her family are saying that I'm being too reckless and an asshole for bringing him against her mother wishes or to wait until he is fully recovered, which is no possible since holidays are near.\n\nSo, AITA for this?\n\nEDIT: I might add that this is not his first injury, he has had some before when being with his mom, hence the reason why we have shared custody, and I got the travel rights. I have never resent her for those accidents since I think some of them is a boy being a boy, but now she is storming out out of the blue.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks u/Clean_Equipment_5450 for pointing out. Hairline Fracture is a more accurate term in english instead of \"broken\". Also a \"strain\" would work, having hard time translating the medical term from my mother language haha", "created_utc": 1701275848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186tp2q/aita_for_bringing_my_kid_to_a_trip_against_his/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Furthermore its 5200m above sea level, so its going to be cold. Might even need oxygen. Has your son done this kind of hiking? Like if I think of our kids in scouting then most 7 years old really don't have any stamina to walk more than two hours.\n\nSo I can understand that your wife is worried that something might happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Yeah seriously the more I read about this hike the crazier it becomes, I highly doubt your son will have any fun doing this.", "You've said in another comment that the trip is actually an extensive hiking vacation in Peru.

I would advise to keep things simple and business-like. Keep all communications written (text or email). If you do have a spoken conversation, follow-up with an email detailing what was said. I wouldn't entertain name calling or accusations. Don't get into worthless arguments that are really about your failed relationship and not your child. Just let your actions be documented. Go on your trip and do all the things! Have fun! But have your son check in with Mom regularly. Maybe at the end of each day, he emails Mom with photos from the day and tells her what he did that day. She has to work through this in whatever way she decides to. So you can only just focus on being a loving Dad. Keep her informed but at arms length. Best of luck!", "Ah, okay. I'm going with NTA, but I do mostly think she's worried for one reason or another.

We have had a cordial relationship but from time-to-time we have this kind of issues. She is now married so hope things gets easier haha", "Yeah, it actually is. He read about 7 color mountain a year or so ago (he likes to read) and he asked me to bring him over. I told him that we must prepare physically and that's why the past few months we climbed every 2 weeks to any place/volcano so he get used to it.\n\nHe even gave a speech in his class about it when school year ended (LATAM schedule). So he is very excited to hike there.", "I'm jealous of the memories your kid is gonna have when he's all grown up", "That. Is. AMAZING.", "Sounds like you\u2019ve got all your \u201cifs\u201d covered", "That's probably it, then. Maybe sit her down and have a conversation about it. Has she ever been a hiker? Usually, for tougher climbs, they send a team with you who have made the climb many times already. Is this your toughest climb, too? She's probably worried something will go wrong and she won't be there, and the broken finger just made the worry worse.", "Thank you! We both try to make our best for him, is just between us that things are icky sometime haha", "No, she has never been a climber. But when we were married, she supported me and when our kid was born, she motivated him to go with me to hike.\n\nThis is not my toughest climb either, but its the first time he is traveling outside the country.\n\nI tried to talk to her about it, but she insisted that is just the injury what she is worried about."]}
