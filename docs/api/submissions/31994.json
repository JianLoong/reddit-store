I get to talk to her today, she finally told me that the reason why she didn't want us to travel is because this was supposed to be our first trip together (the three of us) but since she is now married and pregnant and she can't come, she just lost it. We have traveled when we were married and always talked about traveling with our son, something that is no longer possible.\n\nSo, everything is cleared in the end. :)\n\n================================\n\nMy 7yo has just had a broken finger at the bowling a week ago when playing with me. His mother and I have been divorced for 5 years now and we have shared custody of him.\n\nDoctor said that is a minor injury that will heal in a week or so with just a splint, but she stormed out saying that it would need up to 3 weeks of healing (she is not a doctor). Now she is clamming that my kid can't come to the trip that I planned two months ahead, because of this accident. She even asked the doctor to give her a letter saying that he can't go, and the doctor denied it saying she wouldn't lie on the diagnosis.\n\nSince I have the immigration rights of him, I can travel in-and-out the country with him and this will be his first trip; he is more than excited to go since he has never been in an airplane before. She and her family are saying that I'm being too reckless and an asshole for bringing him against her mother wishes or to wait until he is fully recovered, which is no possible since holidays are near.\n\nSo, AITA for this?\n\nEDIT: I might add that this is not his first injury, he has had some before when being with his mom, hence the reason why we have shared custody, and I got the travel rights. I have never resent her for those accidents since I think some of them is a boy being a boy, but now she is storming out out of the blue.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks u/Clean_Equipment_5450 for pointing out. Hairline Fracture is a more accurate term in english instead of \"broken\". Also a \"strain\" would work, having hard time translating the medical term from my mother language haha", "created_utc": 1701275848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186tp2q/aita_for_bringing_my_kid_to_a_trip_against_his/", "score": 344, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't entertain name calling or accusations. Don't get into worthless arguments that are really about your failed relationship and not your child. Just let your actions be documented. Go on your trip and do all the things! Have fun! But have your son check in with Mom regularly. Maybe at the end of each day, he emails Mom with photos from the day and tells her what he did that day. She has to work through this in whatever way she decides to. So you can only just focus on being a loving Dad. Keep her informed but at arms length. Best of luck!", "Ah, okay. I'm going with NTA, but I do mostly think she's worried for one reason or another.

AMAZING.", "Sounds like you\u2019ve got all your \u201cifs\u201d covered", "That's probably it, then. Maybe sit her down and have a conversation about it. Has she ever been a hiker? Usually, for tougher climbs, they send a team with you who have made the climb many times already. Is this your toughest climb, too? She's probably worried something will go wrong and she won't be there, and the broken finger just made the worry worse.", "Thank you! We both try to make our best for him, is just between us that things are icky sometime haha", "No, she has never been a climber.

NOT SAYING WHAT SHE DID WAS RIGHT but I would be pretty hurt if I talked about a specific trip or the first trip with our kid as a family and I wouldn\u2019t be able to join in. You say this was supposed to be the first trip together as a family ,I\u2019m sure she feels sad about missing that and giving that memory to your child. \n\nWhy is traveling together not possible?

You can bet I still wanted to be a kid while they healed.\n\nI can see from your comments that the plan is to go hiking, on trails that don't require climbing or scrambling (so the activity doesn't inherently have risk to the broken finger). Take your kid on the adventure. If you're worried bring some extra, age appropriate, painkillers, so that if he gets worn out or overtired on the trail and his finger starts to ache you can provide him some relief.\n\nI hiked many trails with broken bones of some kind. In particular I had broken my scafoid and was in a cast for about 10 weeks during a school hiking trip. I needed someone else to carry my pack over the river crossing, but did just fine with the rest of the hike and tent set up etc. I treasure those memories. \nTake your kid on your trip :)", "NTA.
