She has poly substance disorder (more than one substance \\[alcohol and opiates primarily\\]) and there have been several instances (that we're aware of) of her endangering the kids. The most climactic was her driving heavily intoxicated to camp for pick-up, where she ended up being charged with DUI and x2 A&Bs on police officers (she also has diagnosed anger issues/ personality disorder).\n\nThat was last summer - my partner filed for emergency custody, which he got, and she has since continued drinking/ using drugs and has consequently been incarcerated twice.\n\nTheir divorce/ custody battle went to trial (after 3.5 years) this past July, and my partner was rewarded sole legal and physical. A parenting plan was created and they both signed in agreement; it works in stages, stage 1 being supervised at a center all the way to every-other-weekend, \\~6 months down the line, assuming there's no incidents.\n\nWe're in stage 1, and his ex is not meeting all of the conditions required to move into stage 2. She's demanding an increase and crying contempt.\n\nThe conditions not being met:\n\n\\-weekly documentation of AA/NA (we'd accept any support group) attendance/ participation (none have been provided)\n\n\\-a verification letter from her therapist, every 4 weeks, including dates of attendance (one has been provided, without dates, in 10 weeks)\n\n\\-she is supposed to be initiating video calls on Wednesday nights. She continuously needs to reschedule, and refuses to work with her employer to ensure availability. Worth noting that Wednesdays are consistent throughout the parenting plan, eventually progressing into in-person visitations.\n\nAdditionally, there's been some instances of inappropriate behavior during the videocalls that have happened (my partner has to monitor them). Nothing tremendously greivious, but when brought up she's argued that she disagrees with the relevant piece of the parenting plan (for example, she's not supposed to discuss/ promise future visits/ contact (in an effort to avoid disappointing the kids, as she's gone MIA so many times at this point). She's also been argumentative at the visitation center (she brought gifts without them being approved and threw a fit when they weren't allowed in).\n\nToday is another supervised visitation, and again she is sending messages about the logistics of increasing her parenting time, despite my partner repeatedly denying it and referring her back to the plan's conditions (that she isn't meeting).\n\nAre we the assholes for not being flexible? I am a person in recovery and a recovery coach; her refusal to cooperate with a court ordered plan/ take accountability are deeply concerning to me. We are also extremely wary of introducing subjectivity to the plan, as she is the epitome of \"give an inch, take a mile\". I don't put filing for contempt past her, but I don't think we're doing anything wrong. I would really appreciate an unbias opinion!\n\nEdit: she has met some, but not all conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1699283784, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p50ay/aita_for_not_allowing_an_increase_in_parenting/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you let her continue whilst not meeting criteria she won\u2019t meet the next criteria. \nIf she can\u2019t meet the criteria she is a liability and might be endangering the kids down the line. \nStand firm on this one. Either meet all criteria and continue to next stage or game over.", "NTA. She isn't showing proof that she would be safe for the kids. You guys aren't denying more time to hurt her, you're denying for the good of the kids. Conditions were set which means she knows exactly how to get more time with her kids and she can't do it. It would be easier if she could pull at you guys' heartstrings and get you to break the conditions. Stand strong for the kids.", "NTA\n\nThere was a Court Order entered and it set out the requirements for her to earn less supervised and more visitation.  If she meets it, then she's entitled to phase 2, if not, the NO YOU ARE NOT IN CONTEMPT.  She can threaten to file for it, but if she has not met her conditions to satisfy the Court Order, you can't be in contempt.  The idea of a custody order is for the best interest of the children.  Until she meets the order's requirement she has not shown she is acting in the best interest of the children.  If some day she gets her act together and is no longer viewed by the court as a danger to the children, most orders allow voluntary exchanges of time/custody, BUT it is NEVER mandatory to do so.", "Info: I've never been a part of a custody case before, so forgive my lack of knowledge on the topic, but if these were court-ordered conditions, can she really demand more time when she hasn't met the rules that were laid down by the court?\n\nYou're absolutely NTA for wanting to be sure she's a fit guardian, though.", "Are we the assholes for not being flexible?\n\nNo, NTA.  There is a plan forward for her to get more custody and she is refusing to follow it.  At the end of the day, protection of the 2 kids is more important than her visitation.", "NTA.  Part of her time in AA/NA and other addiction treatment is for her to learn how to adult - that actions have consequences and she can't just throw a tantrum to get what she wants.  If she wants increased visitation, she needs to meet the conditions.", " NTA\n\nif she can\u2019t meet all the conditions, she isn\u2019t entitled to more time to endanger her kids because she\u2019s too selfish.", "NTA. I guess I could see where some of the conditions could be altered if possible (like the Wednesday night thing being switched to another night if that's when she works?) but the agreement was already signed, sealed and delivered and I'm sure any changes could be made with a judge's approval.

You aren't denying an increase in parenting time, she is choosing not to gain more parenting time. It's very clear what she needs to do.", "NTA\n\nShe has put the children in danger before and because of this there is a very good reason for the current custodial arrangement.  \n\nIf she was attending the support groups or therapy sessions then it would be an incredibly easy thing for her to prove.  It suggests she simply isn't going to these so isn't even making any attempt to help herself.  \n\nIf she isn't able to meet even these incredibly basic requirements then why should she expect to have any flexibility in the agreement.  \n\nThe kids are the important ones here.  If she cannot figure this out and change her ways then she deserves no sympathy.", "NTA It's great that you believe in her ability to change and feel compassion for her. Don't let it cloud your judgement. These criteria were put in place to ensure that she is committed to and working at being a custodial parent. These aren't arbitrary hoops for her to jump through. She *needs* to be doing all of them, or she's not ready. \n\nY'all should probably restrict contact outside of the scheduled times and refuse to talk to her about anything regarding her custody. Refer her to you lawyer.", "NTA. The children and what is best and their safety comes first.  If she truly wants more time with them she will do what is required. She\u2019s lucky that random drug/alcohol testing wasn\u2019t made a requirement.", "The 6 months doesn't start until conditions are met completely; let alone 6 months being finished. \n\nTell her\n\n\"You're welcome to take us back to court however there are conditions to visitation that you have not met and until they're 100% met consistently your 6 months have not even begun let alone hit the specifications to be completed for applying for more time. Should you chose to take us back to court we'll make sure we are providing all our documentation of your lack of meeting the conditions in place\"", "NTA\n\nWhile these plans can sometimes be a bit too specific,  she is failing every category. Remember 100% success is only a passing grade (D-, 65%)\n\nThe goal here is NOT punishing her, the goal is the health (physical and mental) of the kids. Giving her a break is more likely to endanger that health than improve it.", "NTA\n\nThe court set milestones.  She isn\u2019t meeting them.  That is all you need to say, either to her or yourself.", "i am going through custody issues myself and i wish my ex and his new wife were as understanding and kind as you guys seem. you are NTA. we all had addiction issues and are all clean now, but they use my son as a toy against me and make their own rules, not following the court orders even though my sons father was granted only temporary physical custody and we both have 50/50 legal. i do everything right, the way i should, but his wife hates me so they keep giving me less and less time. they don\u2019t care about how it affects my son, they just care about hurting me. and it\u2019s extremely sad because all my son wants is to be with me again. i\u2019ve never put my son in danger but they took me to court while i was in treatment, bettering myself, so of course he was granted temporary custody. the first time he took me to court, i was granted full physical and we both got 50/50 legal. don\u2019t think YTA, she isn\u2019t doing what she needs to do to prove that she really cares about being in her children\u2019s life. you guys are doing great. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA but what was the mechanism the court put in place to decide whether she moves forward or not? Why haven\u2019t you filed to get relief based on her failure to s follow the court ordered plan?", "NTA all that matters in this situation it's keeping the kids physically and mentally safe. She's proven she can't or won't do that. Until she proves she will, she doesn't get any additional visitation. Tell her until ALL conditions are met for the time required there will be no further discussions. Do not reply to texts that only pertain to increased visitation. End calls when it gets brought up. Nows the time to be firm, no guilt.", "The custodial parent can allow extra time or relax conditions, but it's only going to seriously undermine any future argument to impose or tighten restrictions. Following it to the letter is in everyone's interest.", "There was a parenting plan created, reviewed, edited and signed in court (in front of the judge, during their trial). It specifically requires that she send documentation to my partner (whom I live with, along with the kids). Said plan includes the clause about not discussing future visits (again, created by a lawyer, reviewed and edited by both parents, and signed in front of the judge).", "There's also millions of woman.  There's actually more woman then men. What does this comment mean exactly?  Just pointing out the obvious or trying to Lower the value of humans based on their gender?", "I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not the business of a step-parent that lives with the kids full time. It sounds like she cares about the children and has their best interest in mind. She seems to be stepping up where their birth mother failed.  \n\nIt seems like you are projecting a lot, especially with you type screaming in all caps. Maybe you need to examine why you\u2019re so upset.", "Y'know, that feels pretty presumptuous for someone who has no idea what our family's dynamic looks like. I live with my partner and his kids full time, am a full time caregiver to them and my partner explicitly asks for help and support on this (bc it can all be very overwhelming). This is what works for us, after plenty of discussion and conversations about healthy boundaries. So thanks for your input but I do think you're a little off base. Just something to consider.", "OP very clearly stated she is posting for her and the father.", "Theyre not asking for legal advice, they're asking for moral advice whether they're doing the right thing.  It's her direct family involved and definitely effects her.  Not to mention she clearly  posted on her and husband's behalf makes me wonder why this is so hard to understand.", "Oh youre totally right. Not legal advice at all! Just talking about a custody arrangements, conditions not being met on court ordered parameters, and her request for further visitation rights. Dont need a lawyer for any of that\u2026. \n\nAnd because its not OP\u2019s actual children, she unfortunately gets no say in the matter. Not trying to be mean in saying that, its just the truth. Because this is already before the courts, they wont recognize her as having an opinion or a right in this matter at all. So what does it matter what Reddit thinks???", "Youre right she layed out their plan very detailed and is fully aware of whays happening in that regard.  She seems to have a very good understanding of the legality of whats happening.  Although, You seem to be the one confused about that.  The question wasn't  \"am I doing right legally\" shes asking \"am I doing tight morally\"  which no does not involve a lawyer in the moral regard.  Many people feel as if depriving the mother (even if justified) may not be fair to the kid or the mother, which is a very common concern.  She is asking if they are not being forgiving enough with the mother.\n\nAs we've stated she posted for the both of them, way to glance over that yet again professor brainiac.  Also it's hilarious you think partners dont ask eachother for advice.  I'd gain a bit more life experience before making comments like this again.\n\nYou genuinely cannot comprehend she isn't asking for legal advice and now it's just comical seeing you double down when reading the post disproves you."]}
