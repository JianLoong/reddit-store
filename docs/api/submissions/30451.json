You aren't denying an increase in parenting time, she is choosing not to gain more parenting time.

It suggests she simply isn't going to these so isn't even making any attempt to help herself.  \n\nIf she isn't able to meet even these incredibly basic requirements then why should she expect to have any flexibility in the agreement.  \n\nThe kids are the important ones here.  If she cannot figure this out and change her ways then she deserves no sympathy.", "NTA It's great that you believe in her ability to change and feel compassion for her. Don't let it cloud your judgement. These criteria were put in place to ensure that she is committed to and working at being a custodial parent. These aren't arbitrary hoops for her to jump through. She *needs* to be doing all of them, or she's not ready. \n\nY'all should probably restrict contact outside of the scheduled times and refuse to talk to her about anything regarding her custody. Refer her to you lawyer.", "NTA. The children and what is best and their safety comes first.  If she truly wants more time with them she will do what is required.

That is all you need to say, either to her or yourself.", "i am going through custody issues myself and i wish my ex and his new wife were as understanding and kind as you guys seem. you are NTA. we all had addiction issues and are all clean now, but they use my son as a toy against me and make their own rules, not following the court orders even though my sons father was granted only temporary physical custody and we both have 50/50 legal. i do everything right, the way i should, but his wife hates me so they keep giving me less and less time. they don\u2019t care about how it affects my son, they just care about hurting me. and it\u2019s extremely sad because all my son wants is to be with me again. i\u2019ve never put my son in danger but they took me to court while i was in treatment, bettering myself, so of course he was granted temporary custody. the first time he took me to court, i was granted full physical and we both got 50/50 legal. don\u2019t think YTA, she isn\u2019t doing what she needs to do to prove that she really cares about being in her children\u2019s life. you guys are doing great. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA but what was the mechanism the court put in place to decide whether she moves forward or not? Why haven\u2019t you filed to get relief based on her failure to s follow the court ordered plan?", "NTA all that matters in this situation it's keeping the kids physically and mentally safe. She's proven she can't or won't do that. Until she proves she will, she doesn't get any additional visitation. Tell her until ALL conditions are met for the time required there will be no further discussions. Do not reply to texts that only pertain to increased visitation. End calls when it gets brought up. Nows the time to be firm, no guilt.", "The custodial parent can allow extra time or relax conditions, but it's only going to seriously undermine any future argument to impose or tighten restrictions. Following it to the letter is in everyone's interest.", "There was a parenting plan created, reviewed, edited and signed in court (in front of the judge, during their trial). It specifically requires that she send documentation to my partner (whom I live with, along with the kids). Said plan includes the clause about not discussing future visits (again, created by a lawyer, reviewed and edited by both parents, and signed in front of the judge).", "There's also millions of woman.

I live with my partner and his kids full time, am a full time caregiver to them and my partner explicitly asks for help and support on this (bc it can all be very overwhelming). This is what works for us, after plenty of discussion and conversations about healthy boundaries. So thanks for your input but I do think you're a little off base.

Not to mention she clearly  posted on her and husband's behalf makes me wonder why this is so hard to understand.", "Oh youre totally right. Not legal advice at all! Just talking about a custody arrangements, conditions not being met on court ordered parameters, and her request for further visitation rights. Dont need a lawyer for any of that\u2026. \n\nAnd because its not OP\u2019s actual children, she unfortunately gets no say in the matter. Not trying to be mean in saying that, its just the truth. Because this is already before the courts, they wont recognize her as having an opinion or a right in this matter at all. So what does it matter what Reddit thinks???", "Youre right she layed out their plan very detailed and is fully aware of whays happening in that regard.  She seems to have a very good understanding of the legality of whats happening.  Although, You seem to be the one confused about that.  The question wasn't  \"am I doing right legally\" shes asking \"am I doing tight morally\"  which no does not involve a lawyer in the moral regard.  Many people feel as if depriving the mother (even if justified) may not be fair to the kid or the mother, which is a very common concern.  She is asking if they are not being forgiving enough with the mother.\n\nAs we've stated she posted for the both of them, way to glance over that yet again professor brainiac.  Also it's hilarious you think partners dont ask eachother for advice.  I'd gain a bit more life experience before making comments like this again.\n\nYou genuinely cannot comprehend she isn't asking for legal advice and now it's just comical seeing you double down when reading the post disproves you.", "I can't even believe this person came here to ask this question.", "NTA. She has not earned the privilege of you giving her flexibility.

I hope your partner is documenting every single thing. And can they record the video visits? They should if it's allowed or if partner lives in a one-consent state. \n\nYour partner's sole responsibility is to protect the kids. Neither of you should be considering what she wants. Just document and follow the plan.", "NTA - I assume the plan was made for the benefit of the children, so if your break it now, or start giving in to her demands, it will only harm kids. If she really wanted to spend time with her children (for the sake of the children, not of her own), she's do her best to comply.", "NTA.  Do not reward her bad behavior.

Thank you for putting your kids first.", "NTA.  It sounds like that parenting plan was set up to protect the kids.  It would be wrong of you and your partner to increase the ex's parenting time without knowing she is taking steps to be a safe person for the kids to be around.  I'm guessing there's still a lot of using going on there.  Stick to the plan.", "NTA these poor kids. Shes honestly lucky that there is even any sort of path to her seeing her kids at all.

Those kids are lucky to have you in their lives.", "Absolutely NTA! She needs to conform to the agreements. Quite frankly, her history is alarming and I wouldn\u2019t trust her at all. Definitely do not allow her to have more access without proving sobriety.", "NTA. These are not meaningless hoops for her to jump through. These are indicative of her willingness and ability to stay sober and be a safe parent. She shouldn't get more time until she does meet **all** the conditions.", "These are things that the state would make her do if her kids were in CPS care before they would increase time. I know as a formal CPS social worker if you increase times without her meeting criteria then your partner could be in trouble if they progress and she uses around the kids.", "NTA protect the kids. When she complies with all conditions of phase one she can love to 2.", "NTA, stay the course. This isn\u2019t about you, your partner, or the ex - it\u2019s about the safety and stability of the kids.", "We went through the same thing with my husband's ex. Those steps are there for a reason. If she can't make even the most basic conditions- she has no business getting visitation increased. She just wants a reason to complain. Do not give in. Stick to the plan, and make her follow through. If she was even making a small amount of effort.... She doesn't want to do the work but wants to blame you guys for her troubles. Just ignore her. You have to do what's best for the kids. Good luck. NTA. BTW, you might come check out r/stepparents. It's a place to discuss issues like this with other step parents, if you ever need to vent.", "NTA... be exacting in taking notes. Have lists of missed visits. And document and strange behavior.  Keep it legal and show your efforts to comply.", "Nta", "Absolutely NTA! The mother\u2019s insistence she be allowed to ignore the plan she agreed to that was put into place in light of her dangerous and criminal behavior is the **last** thing you should do with respect to the best interests of the children. Stay the course. Let her try convincing a judge you\u2019re violating the plan. Be sure to file a counterclaim for the same and bring the receipts. Make it clear you want no contact except that needed to address visitation. \n\nAlso, small word of practical advice, carry a conformed (stamped) copy issued by the court of the documents giving you custody, including the terms of the plan and keep them in your glove compartment. Can\u2019t tell you how many times people like this mother call the cops claiming their parental rights are being violated. I developed the habit of telling all my family law clients to do this after my husband\u2019s ex called the cops claiming he was violating a stay away order she waived at them (he was helping their grown son to move out of the apartment he no longer wanted to share with his mother) only to be charged with misusing 911 when he produced a stamped and sealed copy of the dismissal of said order issued years earlier.", "NTA.  I would use a canned response.  \u201cYou have failed to meet many of the court requirements for this stage.  If you do not like the court requirements, please take it up with the court.  The kids will not be put at risk.\u201d  Really, I think you two should show her repeated issues to the court and have them revoke the majority of visitation.", "NTA. She can\u2019t be bothered to meet the conditions, she doesn\u2019t get more time.", "NTA\n\nShe hasn't met the conditions, and it will never be your job to lie for an addict.", "NTA.\n\nPlus, if OP and partner knowingly allow her to short change any of the conditions and something bad happens, that could be used against THEM as well as ex. These kind of orders are not entered into lightly by the court and judges tend to get upset with anyone who disregards them, including the 'good' parent, especially if something happens to the kids because of such violations/shortcomings.", "NTA \n\nexactly. the kids safety is top priority", "Plenty of custody agreements allow the parents to vary the conditions if they would like. The court does like positive parenting situations where parents are able to work stuff out without dragging the legal system in.", "I'm so sorry you're going through this, especially when you're fighting the good fight against addiction. Congratulations on finding the strength and motivation to make the change.\n\nWhat matters in these disputes is the wellbeing, physical & emotional, of the kids. I will admit, there are times I feel enormous contempt for my partner's ex, but her kids love her and I love them; I don't want them to feel the pain of not having her. I wish I could spare them all of it, but being in recovery myself I know what it's like to be unwell and I know we need to keep the kids away from substance addiction and associated behavior.\n\nI mentioned, but I'm a recovery coach and in addition to my own personal situation I also work with people who have DCF involvement due to substance use disorder related issues. Message me if you need support; I might, via experience, have insight. I will certainly have encouragement for you.\n\nYour son will grow older and will begin to recognize everything for what it is.

Additionally, utilizing the lawyer is *expensive* and, after years of fighting, it's already cost him a small fortune. If she wants to take it to court, that's on her.", "I disagree, or we would've contacted the lawyer. If it rises to that level, we will.\n\nIf we were to tag the lawyer in every time she was defiant and/ or threatening we would be corresponding with them on a near weekly basis. We would also probably go bankrupt. To a point, we need to assess situations and do what we feel is in the best interest of the kids. If she does decide to file for contempt, rest assured our lawyer will promptly be brought in. Most often, her threats are empty and a manipulative attempt at getting us to waver.\n\nIt can be challenging to trust that we're doing the right thing, since we are quite biased, have been immersed in this conflict for years, and receive relentless messaging from the ex that we're awful people who are carelessly traumatizing the children. It's extremely helpful to hear the input of people outside of the situation.", "oh thank you so much that is so kind of you! \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc95 you are absolutely right though, it is the children\u2019s wellbeing that matters and regardless of how they feel about me, they need to put that aside and think about my son and his feelings. i could see if i was in the shoes of your partners ex and not doing well/not following certain rules like she has, but there are no rules for me to follow. all i need to do is stay in recovery for myself so i can live a good life, be there and be a good mother to my son. my exs wife doesn\u2019t like that i\u2019m sober and doing well though because she doesn\u2019t want me around. it\u2019s kind of sad and sick. but like i said i do feel for you and i do hope you\u2019ve come to realize now that you\u2019re NTA. if she actually cared, she\u2019d put in the hard work.

It\u2019s a legal issue more than anything else.", "I think it's the combo of seeing the kids perpetually heartbroken by her absence and her relentlessly telling us we're traumatizing them that can sometimes make me wonder if we're the assholes."]}
