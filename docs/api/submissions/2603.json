If that was the case, she shouldn\u2019t be on \u2018AITA\u2019 and she should be over at /legaladvice on how to press charges. \n\n\nIf she is THAT  uncomfortable with being around her BIL, she shouldn\u2019t have gotten in the car and she needs to have an adult conversation with her husband and maybe think about divorcing him because after all, one comes with the other since they are literally related.", "What was your Plan to go to the airport?", "Me too", "So when women that say no over and over again to sex, but then he goes ahead and has sex anyway. In your mind that\u2019s not rape huh? \n\nHe coerced her into a ride she was clear she didn\u2019t want, probably to not upset her husband. He\u2019s a sick AH.", "That\u2019s like saying to a rape victim \u201cbut you got to have sex\u201d! Come on, she said no, he shouldn\u2019t have been at her house, period.", "How\u2019d she get to the airport", "My guess is that OP knew that it wouldn\u2019t be worth it at that point. Either BiL would get belligerent and embarrass her if she tried to call a car for herself, or cause problems with her husband. Just\u2026 this is clearly someone who is used to dealing with this man\u2019s bs and is trying to pick her battles.", ">I told him I would tell my husband he was being nasty to me again so he stopped. He did tell my husband what I did\u2026but I\u2019ve refused so far.\n\nNTA. Good on the OP. She sounds like she can handle herself but she shouldn\u2019t have to endure the BIL\u2019s intrusive actions. The husband needs to set him straight but I get the feeling he\u2019s onboard with the BIL\u2019s behavior. Ick. \ud83d\udea9", "ESH - Sounds like a wonderfully dysfunctional family and you all probably deserve one another.", "NTA. Aside from you telling him you werent riding together, Why didn't he go sit in the car? He was just trying to find things to make your fault.", "Nta, he could have either listened and not tried to pick you up and let you make your way yourself, or waited in his car", "NTA\n\nNext time, mean it, if you say no and make your own way there if thats what you want to do.\n\nGetting your point across would have been ignoring the knocking, calling an uber and ignoring BIL. \n\nThen you could have told your husband, with a pikachu face that you have no idea why his brother acts as though you mean yes, when you specifically and succintly tell him no.", "NTA. I hope you waited at the door the last minute or two.", "NTA. \n\nIt nay have been a little petty, but you told him not to come. If someone knocks on my door and I'm not expecting company, I'm not opening it. You're either coming when you know I don't want you here or coming when you're not sure if I want you here, both of which are disrespectful to you and your space.", "NTA- man shows up uninvited and demands you let him in? That's not resonable. But why are younmarried to a man who disregards your request and incourages other men to do so as well? Being single sounds a little better than being with a man who does not respect your boundaries and encourages other men to disrespect your boundaries as well.", "It's weird that your husband would insist. Is he using his brother to watch/control you while you're away?", "ESH", "YTA. I get that you don't like him, but you shouldn't have left him outside in the rain for such a long time. It was weird of him to force you to be with him, but are we just going to ignore that your husband did the same thing? Why treat bil badly and not say anything to husband?", "YTA", "YTA. Time to grow up honey. You're acting like you're 12.", "INFO are you a usually late person? Or have missed flights previously?\n\nTo me this sounds like a situation of someone who is know to be late/have missed a flight (you said you were running late) so your husband sent his brother to make sure you made the flight. Especially with him banging on the door for urgency.", "Another question: why is OP\u2019s door the only one ever made without a rain cover?", "Because he's the one that told the brother to pick her up. I'd bet money on it.", "Oh no he had to wait in his car. What a travesty. Especially after being told not to come.", "Yeah, I agree showing up after being told no and demanding to be let in does show childlike pettiness. Not sure why you have a Y T A though. Should be NTA. Fixed it for ya", "FWIW justified AH I believe is considered NTA", "BIL chose to stand in the rain. He could have waited in his car. NTA.", "How?", "Not being ready \u201con time\u201d isn\u2019t a factor in this except for her own comfort/stress level since he wasn\u2019t even supposed to be there in the first place. And how was he making life easier for her when he added so much extra stress and aggravation to a process that she, as an adult, had covered?", "Mine doesn\u2019t have one either. I hate it, but I\u2019m not the one who had this house built.", "OMG, I can't stop laughing at that spelling. Fantastic!", "And \"get lost\" means \"take me I'm yours\" /s \n\nSorry your line made me think of a movie quote I was just finishing the quote I know no means no", "Maybe the BIL skipped kindergarten. /s", "Any number of ways that don\u2019t include acting like a child.  I feel like all these N T A votes are from people that have never made a marriage work.  I\u2019ll eat the downvotes.", "What? How? Did I miss something? Sorry if I did? If there was assault I do change my stance.", "By letting her husband's brother stand out in the rain like stranger. After her husband invited him over to ride with her to the airport. She's a drama queen and it's easy to see why the brother in law doesn't like her. If unnecessary nonsense like this continues she will be despised by the entire family.", "i meant marriage counseling for husbands insistence", "Or worse, pants with pockets", "Because everything about this sounds like the worst kind of straight people relationship dynamics. \n\nIs it possible that OP is a man? Yes, of course. Is it likely from everything OP has written here? I don't think so, but you're welcome to correct me.", "Well, I know what the kids and I are watching today", "Meg was the best Disney princess\n\n(And don't y'all come at me with \"not a princess\", life sucks too much to be that person)", "I watched that last Saturday", "Youre dense.  It seems pretty obvious to me that she doesn't like this asshole because he does stupid shit like pound on her front door for 15 minutes in the pouring rain after being told NOT to come in the first place; and then after being told to wait coming to the door anyway and trying to force his way inside anyway and acting like a petulant child the entire way to the airport by shooting her dirty looks and as soon as they arrived, tattling to her husband about what she did so he can demand she apologize to him.", "I don\u2019t think that should matter. If she really doesn\u2019t like him and can make/pay her own way, why isn\u2019t her husband listening to her? Unless they can\u2019t afford it, I think a bigger problem is why your husband blatantly disregarded your wishes. Does he normally do that?\n\nEdit to add: it may be logical but logic isn\u2019t always the prime motivator. I\u2019ve chosen not to carpool with people even though it made sense and would\u2019ve saved us all money. But I preferred to have my own space and wanted to be comfortable in my car, etc.", "I also don\u2019t see that as a leap. If husband still sent brother to pick up his wife, when wife is clearly not comfortable around him, couples therapy isn\u2019t a big leap. More marriages would do better if they did the work in therapy instead of letting things fester. \n\nHusband clearly did not respect his wife\u2019s boundary. He placed her in an uncomfortable situation, where she was left with her BIL alone. Would you want to be left alone with someone of the opposite sex, alone? After insisting to your spouse that you\u2019d be fine getting yourself to the airport? \n\nTherapy sounds much better than just arguing about it.", "I miss pockets, and the fake ones are an abomination.", "Im so sorry, only because ive been laughing at the way you spelled \u201cwomen\u201d for like 10 minutes \u2026 \ud83d\udc80", "Glad I could help", "Agree though technically she isn't a Disney princess she was a Greek one though", "That's why I asked before where her hatred comes from because it seems like brother and hubby don't get it. If I got all the hate from someone I feel from her I would not pick her up no matter what. Something odd is going on. I mean I doubt her hubby would let her drive in his car  if he SA her or if he saw how her brother treated her. Some stories also have different perspectives we only get her anger. We don't even know where her hubby was I mean how comes only her brother flew to the parents ? was her hubby already there ?wouldn't it be normal to fly together as a couple ? so things are missing", "Yeah. That's exactly what I am saying", "There is an /s on the comment. \ud83d\ude44", "She gave into the pressure put on her by her husband.", "NTA.  OK, I don't know why you originally don't like your BIL but him coming to your home, choosing to stand in the rain and knock on your door for 15 minutes, and then berating you, makes me not like him.  Tell your husband to back off, stop being an AH, and start being an actual partner.", "NTA- it\u2019s super weird he showed up anyway and why wouldn\u2019t he just wait in his car? Very odd", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. By which I mean your BIL.\n\nNTA.\n\nYou said no and both YOUR HUSBAND and BIL railroaded over that? You should have a talk with your husband because that's not okay.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t think your the AH. However, you could have acted more mature. So you don\u2019t like him and he sucks. But leaving him in the rain is childish. Let him in and then go about your business until your ready to go. You made your self look stupid by your actions. Now he gets to play victim even tho he\u2019s the idiot. You can\u2019t give people like him an inch because they will always take it a mile.", "ESH him and your husband sound terrible, and it\u2019s also not nice to leave someone waiting in the rain. But also he had no right showing up when you told him not to", "INFO are you chronically late and miss appointments and flights? Are you flying to a country that women need or should really have a family an escort? How old is everyone involved?", "NTA. You told him you didn\u2019t want him there early it was his own fault", "NTA. He's an adult. He made his decision.", "NTA and you should now refer to BIL as \"Boundary Stomper\" when talking with hubs OR BIL himself, henceforth forward.\n\nHad you let him in you would have rewarded him for ignoring your wishes, which only emboldens the Boundary Stomper.", "NTA, he knew you didn't want him there and he still came and got mad after you didn't open the door", "NTA. Next time call an Uber. Give BIL the bird and wave bye bye.", "INFO: Where are you that you have no free will of your own and have to do what men say?", "YTA \n\nThis is peak Reddit logic. \u201cI told him not to come and meet at the airport. Guess he can wait in his car\u201d\n\nI guarantee no one here would do that in real life. Just let him in and tell him to wait.", "Soft YTA. Your husband arranged this too, so why are you only blaming BIL ?", "Well she won\u2019t have to put up with bil trying to use her as his play doll", "Lmao. Thank you for spelling it that way. I know someone who would've said this in all seriousness and he cannot spell to save his life and it reminded me of that.", "I wouldn\u2019t, but I would also still let him in. Why shoot yourself in the foot and be petty for no reason. What\u2019s he going to do, start stealing thins?", "Sure be mad, but also be practical. Why make your relationship with your BIL even worse, especially because you will have to interact with him as long as your married", "Yeh let\u2019s continue to burn the bridge with the person I\u2019ll have to interact with for years to come", "Wasn't even talking about OP but okay assume away", "I saw that in a comment, but like what does that mean? I wanted some more specific details on what this guy did. Also her husband being part of the insistence on this guy going with her.
