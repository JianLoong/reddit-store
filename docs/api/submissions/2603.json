Even before she explained how he treated her poorly, she explained his boundary stomping and how she wasn't comfortable with him?

He has a history of treating her horribly, so she didn't want to ride with him, didn't want him to pick her up, and didn't want him in her home. \nShe gave in enough to him and her husband by traveling with him. But she's TA for not giving in to let him on where he can be a jerk to her in her own home when she's getting ready?\n\nNope. She's NTA.

All because of YOUR bad planning (as YOU were running late)", "YTA - for extreme pettiness", "NTA. Your husband and his brothers are treating you like a child, you never should have been in that car with him if you didn't want to.\n\nYou didn't make him stand in the rain.

She used her words, they were ignored, and then she\u2026 well didn\u2019t even quite ignore him. She told him she\u2019d be 15 minutes.

Did he have a warrant?  No obligation to let him in. None.", "How is it her fault he stood outside in the rain for 15 mins like. When he has a perfectly dry car to sit in.

Its redit im not going to sit here and write out every situation where consent is only for sexual. Smh", "No but you clearly have not had YOUR boundaries crossed or your opinions ignored because other people want to do what they want. Don\u2019t be a jerk and besides the other person is absolutely correct you have never felt vulnerable or uncomfortable in daily situations.\nAs someone who has felt uncomfortable in DAILY situations I cannot imagine OP\u2019s situation with her BIL as he blatantly ignored her and did what he and his brother(OP\u2019s husband) wanted.", "Do you always make aggressively dismissive comments then follow them up with a statement intended to argue your point but lacking any actual point or reasonable argument? You seem to not want to attempt to explain your stated opinion, and in my experience people that refuse to elaborate themselves are often doing so because their statements aren\u2019t actually defendable in any meaningful or sensible manner.", "She made it pretty clear that she finally broke down and rode with him when she said he gave her dirty looks the whole ride. So you\u2019re saying that if she continued to ignore him for as long as it took her Lyft to get there it would magically make her (in your eye) NTA? Pretty sure most people would be yelling that it was even more petty and AHish. \n\nShe didn\u2019t want the ride. She told him clearly that she didn\u2019t want it and he shouldn\u2019t show up. That he did so anyhow and stood in the rain just to be aggressive at her is 100% on him. Her feeling badgered and finally giving in and getting in the damn car doesn\u2019t change that."]}
