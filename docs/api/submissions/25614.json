A SAHP would be responsible for the majority of childcare, errands, cooking, and other housework.  How much of that is your husband doing?\n\nThere are many people who have serious disabilities but still work.  If his pain is manageable, then it's moreikely that your husband is depressed or has just given up.

You are being an ahole to him about this.  This is new to him.   He can't just \"get over it\" and move on.  You are not in his shoes.  You don't know what he's feeling or thinking.  His life has been drastically changed and he's probably depressed.  He needs counseling stat!\n\nThe solution?  You tell him that finances are getting tighter.  You are getting tired.  He cannot take care of the kids how he is right now.  Him being angry, bitter, and depressed is not good for them to be raised.  He could snap at them for no reason.  He has two options:  1. Get a remote job within a month or two or 2. Apply for disability benefits.  Get a lawyer and go for it because you need another source of income because you cannot continue on 10 hours a day.  Him throwing the SAHM in your face is not fair to you.  Tell him that being a SAHD means he does EVERYTHING-Raising the kids, cleaning the house and cooking, not that the latter two falls on you when you get home.  It's not the same.  You also need to get marriage counseling because he needs a wake up call.", "NAH. My dad is paralyzed from the chest down and has been for 4 years now. He literally does everything. He has two jobs. He drives. He swims. He does most of the cleaning and all of the cooking. He goes grocery shopping. He has a pole saw and trims the freaking trees! The only things I really do to help are really difficult things like changing lightbulbs in the ceiling fixtures, not because he can\u2019t but because he will break about 5 of them before he gets one in properly \ud83d\ude02. \n\nYour husband is capable. He is just in a mental slump. This is definitely a therapy kinda thing. For both of you. Being the primary caregiver is so, so hard. You need a break. He needs to break out of his bleak existence. Try to get him to join a paraplegic group. You\u2019d be amazing by all the things they do! A couple months ago the one my dad is in went on a rock climbing expedition. And they are so full of motivation and have great tips to adapt. \n\nYour husband suffered from a massive life changing event. It sucks. But 2 years is enough time to mope about.

It might be too late but you need to get him into therapy to discuss that issue (was he ever in therapy after the accident? i probably should ask that first) with someone who can help him see that life happens and you didnt force the car to hit him. if he doesnt want to accept help and to talk it out with a professional then you probably need to leave. He already isnt doing anyything to help with money or kids or chores so you know you can get by on your own. Why be with a man who blames you for an accident and holds it over your head? you wanna hear that every time he doesnt get his way \"well you should do this for me because it's your fault im like this\"  \n\n\ntherapy or leave him, but don't put up with this.

You asked him to get groceries that the both of you need. He agreed. An accident happened--something that's always a risk while driving. It's manipulative and abusive to throw the blame for such a complicated situation onto you when there's someone who's much easier to blame--the person who ran the red light. He's blaming you for this now of all times in order to get you to cave and do all the work for him.\n\nYou both need serious marriage counseling from a professional.", "This is bait", "Gentle ESH \n\nWhy can't he be a SAHD? What is wrong with it? You two need to sit, lay everything out on the table, and work out a plan for the next 5 years. Maybe that means him applying for disability. That extra cash can go towards him taking online classes in something he can do with his new disability. (Be it IT, medical billing, ot whatever.) Then he'd be more likely to be able to WFH.\n\nNo matter what you decide, understand how he's adjusting to the disability as well. BOTH of you need therapy. Both separate and as a couple. The kids, too, I'm sure, because adapting to Daddy being disabled is going to take some work. Best of luck, and keep the lines of communication open.", "There's not enough info in here to judge anything and he needs therapy at minimum.", "I get his reasoning that he wouldn\u2019t have been at the place of the accident if he hadn\u2019t gone out after you asking him to go get groceries. He obviously has not accepted his new life as a person with physical limitations. He needs (more) counseling/therapy and I\u2019d recommend a psychiatrist in case he needs meds. This is also clearly not the time for him to start working again. He may be able to do part-time once he has fully accepted his new life. And that obviously is not now. NAH, you asked hi.

You are not the one who has to deal with the fact that you are probably never walk again. I can't imagine his state of mind. And it sounds really, really unfair since It seems his precious income was important to the household and If he never had a problem with work before the accident.You could have handled better.

I would also recommend family therapy and marriage counseling. Again if he won\u2019t go, you and the kids should.\n\nYou are not to blame for your husband\u2019s accident. The driver of the car that hit him is. Did you get any settlement money? I know it can be hard to recover financially from car accidents because insurance limits the amount you can recover in many states.\n\nYour husband has had two years to process his feelings and get used to his new disability. He may never get used to it, but having you work 10 hour days, raise the kids, and do all the chores is an untenable situation. If he is not willing or able to be an SAHD then he needs to start the process of applying for disability. Disability applications are a long and difficult process. Your husband should find a lawyer to help him start this process if he is not willing to look for work. \n\nSee if your health insurance covers respite care. It\u2019s unlikely but it\u2019s worth checking. Then start looking for community organizations. That might help you get some relief for now.  Your husband has already made it clear that you can\u2019t look to him for help at this time save yourself some anxiety and believe him on this. Move forward without him.\n\nThis will get me down votes, but if he is really bent on blaming you for his disability then I think you need to leave. I am not saying you have to leave yet. I think you should give him a chance. Let him turn this around by either looking for work or getting on disability in the next year, give him the opportunity to step up as a SAHD. That said if you continue giving him opportunities and he continues ignoring them. Then I think it would be best for you and your children if you divorce.
