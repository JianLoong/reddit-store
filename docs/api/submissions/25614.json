A SAHP would be responsible for the majority of childcare, errands, cooking, and other housework.  How much of that is your husband doing?\n\nThere are many people who have serious disabilities but still work.  If his pain is manageable, then it's moreikely that your husband is depressed or has just given up.  He might benefit from counseling.\n\nBut if you're done with this relationship, that's a completely valid thing for you to feel.

Two years out sounds like excess time to someone able bodied.
