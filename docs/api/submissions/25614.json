He says I am being unsupportive and he is struggling with his new disability, and I said that\u2019s just a cop out. This made him really upset, so I dropped the topic for some time.

Marriage counseling (and maybe individual therapy) might be a good idea.", "NAH, but .. if he's suddenly blaming you at all for a traffic accident, along with continuing to refuse to look for work or remove any household responsibilities from your shoulders, it's time for therapy: him, you, maybe the family. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA you\u2019ve not said how they were injured, but if it\u2019s just that you asked them to go out and an accident occurred, then you should get him some professional help as he\u2019s seemingly been fostering resentment for your \u201cactions\u201d", "if the other car ran the red light resulting in your husband being disabled now and financially fraught why are you not sueing the other party? or their insurance?", "Can he qualify for some sort of disability? Is he in any sort of therapy? I think you guys need help and some sort of guidance on disability resources available where you live, rather than judgment. NAH", "Maybe neither are the asshole here. Does he have PTSD from the accident? Is he capable of working outside the home? He can work from home. But if he\u2019s mentally still a mess from the accident he can\u2019t connect with that. Also you\u2019re right to press him on this and look for solutions. It\u2019s your life too. Find out if his complications now are more mental or physical and proceed accordingly.", "NAH\n\nYou are both in a very difficult and tough situation.\n\nI think your husband will probably be feeling worthless and have very low self esteem given what he has lost (I speak from experience as a man with a progressive physical disability) and is likely to be struggling to cope with the idea of getting back into the outside world. At the same time, you all have to live and to do that you need money and you are in the situation where you have to both work and take care of the house.\n\nIt is absolutely wrong of your husband to blame you for the accident and that is a conversation you both need to have quickly as it has clearly been on his mind. You asking him to go out in the rain is no different to you having to go to work in the rain to support both of you.\n\nMaybe, when you are both in a receptive frame of mind, it would be a good idea to sit down and list what jobs he is physically able to do and let the idea that he is able to do these jobs settle in his mind and see where it goes from there.\n\nI hope it works out for both of you and you can work through it together.", "NTA - it definitely isn't your fault OP", "NAH, this is a really tough situation for both of you which needs therapy, not random internet strangers making opinions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Seems like he is doing nothing... Just because he is on a wheelchair doesn't mean he gets to be pitied for it. Of course he will need some adaptations and there is stuff that he won't be able to do, but he needs to help you out, and if he doesn't/ can't do chores, it's time for him to at least try to find a job.\n\nAlso, not your fault that the car skipped the red light.", "NTA. He should try to find some work he can do now. It probably would be good for his self esteem and self worth to be able to contribute to the household again, plus you need to cut your hours a bit to be able to not stress as much and still keep your household afloat. Sounds like he could really use some therapy though to help him cope with the accident and accept his new disability and changes in life. So while he may physically be ready to work again, he may need a little help getting there mentally. And no what happened to him was not your fault. Accidents happen and we can\u2019t usually foresee it, if we could then they wouldn\u2019t call it an accident.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nYou do a 10 hour day and all the chore and look after the kids.\n\nHe is being unfair, he is blaming you and refusing to work is his protest. He needs therapy.", "NAH, he should at least try to improve his life, and should look into therapy.", "NTA. The accident was definitely not your fault. \n\nAnd if your family have some trouble with finances, he should do something to help. Transitions can be hard, so maybe he could start with working part-time.", "NTA. And the accident was not your fault, you didn't run the red light. Would your husband have liked it if you had wrapped him in cotton wool and locked him in the house? He's disabled, I'm sorry for that but it's no excuse to be an AH by freeloading on you and blaming you. He might feel better if he gets work. If not, you're not obliged to stay with him.while he throws himself an eternal pity party. You should let him know that (encourage counselling plus give him an ultimatum too)", "Sounds like he needs a shrink. Also if your working extra  and keeping the house, you need to put your foot down. He can keep the house, or hire someone with his own money to do it, or pay for therapy for yourself (with his own money) for going crazy with overwork.\n\nBlaming you for the accident??? Da fudgemuffins? You gotta ask if if he's really that stupid. I guess ask nicely though.", "NTA. it is very fair for him to start working since he wont or cant do the house work. He is disable but lots of disable people wkrk everyday. He can start with some part time thing and see how it goes.\n\nHowever, you have bigger problems: the you are responsible for his accident? maybe it was something he said without thinking in the heat of the moment or maybe it is something he really thinks about. Bottom line if you wanna save your mariage, you really have to talk about this!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Then he said it\u2019s my fault that he got in the accident in the first place, because I sent him out to get groceries in the rain.\" .. don't allow this. His accident si NOT your fault.\n\nHe needs therapy, and he can't just sit down and become your dependent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime for couple's therapy, and maybe a divorce.", "Info? Is he receiving money for disability? Has he seen anyone for his mental health? How is he as person right now?\n\nI know money is tight and you're struggling. Your anxiety over it and the home life is justified. The problem I see is that you're making him the issue. Which isn't fair considering the circumstances.\n\nHow are you dealing with his disability? How has it affected your mental health? How has it affected your communication and intimacy(non sexual and sexual)?", "INFO: What can he actually do? Does he have movement in his hands? Is he able to be independently at home alone whilst you work? Can he drive in an adapted vehicle? What was his job previously?", "I would Say telling someone There disability is a cop out when They Say They cant work is kind of YTA.", "His entire life has just changed, probably deep depression, phantom pains etc. Thats What he is doing. Suffering, i know people who got in car accidents and got weelchair bound. It took way more than 2 years to bounce back.", "Freeloading?", "With his own money??? The man is disabled and in a wheelchair. The whole point of this post is that they have no money. And thoughI'm actually an advocate of separate finances I find it quite cruel to make a newly disabled person feel worse buy demanding they pay for therapy for their spouse because they are depressed because their spouse is disabled.", "Depending on whether they\u2019ve been signed off, or are just feeling sorry for themselves", "This is reddit silly, men don\u2019t have those problems \ud83e\udd2d\n\n/s", "Most people that loose the ability to walk in an accident \u201dfeels sorry\u201d for themselves.
