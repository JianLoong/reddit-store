Would you still say that if they'd literally hit him? \nYou made the right call and power to you for it! \n\nAlso did a truly awesome thing by taking her family's last name.", "As an adult you get to choose what you want to do.  Your parents may not like your choices but that's on them.  You can't control how they feel.  Telling you if they don't come then no family comes is a ridiculous power move.  You are starting a life with your partner.  Her feelings and comfort should come before your parents.  NTA", "They're the ones throwing a fit about this inconsequential detail, but you are the shallow one. Yeah that makes perfect sense. / S", "Your surname doesn't impact them at all. NTA", "NTA\n\nThey threatened not to attend the wedding and you called their bluff. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nMaybe consider making up a brand-new name for you and your partner to take and then neither family is 'winning'", "I don't feel like you are an AH here but you are clearly conflicted.  I don't sense that you actually Want to go NC but are just upset over the reaction they had to the name issue.  Sounds like you have Lots of thinking/reflection to do.", "Cringe.", "Not that it has to do anything with the verdict, but why is it not an option to just leave each other's last names alone? You make it sound like since she can't take your name, you must take hers when in reality it's not a mandatory step.", "YTA \n\nThey\u2019ve apologised and are trying to move on and you and your fianc\u00e9 are acting quite childish about going no contact. To be honest that news would be quite shocking to a lot of folks and I can\u2019t help but think there\u2019s more to this story. Your folks getting upset that their son is changing their surname is horrid yes but worth cutting all ties because? No matter who is at the wedding there will be a joke about you taking her surname because it is against the norm.", "ESH - Should your parents have acted out and got petty and said they wouldn't come and that no one else would either? No..... But I can't imagine that you didn't think this would cause a problem. I mean even your future in-laws (who know your fam less than you do) knew it would be a problem, so the fact that you are so \"blown away\" seems far fetched to me. Depending on where you are from (and I have to believe based on reactions that it's not somewhere that taking the bride's name is normal) this is out of the norm and people expect there son to carry on the family name, and it sounds like you would be the only one to do that as you only talk about having step-siblings.\n\nYou suck because after the initial shock was gone and they had time to come to terms they did apologize to you, yet you still don't want to invite them back. And your fiance sucks because she being overly dramatic about the whole situation.", "ESH this sounds like a mess all around and you all are acting like children", "YTA", "Your parent's disrespected your decision made with your fiance, threatened to boycott your wedding and learned that you would not buckle to their threat.  NTA;  You father 's expression of his disagreement took this from a disagreement to potential estrangement.\n\nI think this might blow over and OP can reconcile ('break the ice') with his family but should focus on the immediate and tangible.  Keeping contact to relevant for the siblings in the wedding keeps things from finding another flashpoint.  Rather than force any issues immediately, give everyone a little room to breath and touch grass.", "Most parents are old fashioned & you shocked them.  They behaved badly.  They have since apologized.  Is living the rest of your life without your parents & siblings what you really want? I was raised to forgive. I would assure them I have not forgotten, however, I would give them a second chance.", "YTA\n\nThey're your parents, you'll regret it if they're not at your wedding. \n\n\nWhy not come up with a new last name thats a hybrid of both of yours.", "Right, they need to apologize to partner too.", "The no contact was their response to uninviting them - they said that if they don't come then that is a BIG decision that I am making that can't come back from", "Uhm, if somebody jokes about it, maybe it's time to reassess if OP needs such backwater sexist friends. It's 21st century, there is no \"norm\" so to speak.", "It was the reaction that caused me to uninvite them, their aggressiveness and threats that they would not come and that my family wouldn't come so I took their threat and uninvited them as I don't want threats aimed at me and want them to see their consequences of acting this way. I don't care what people have to say about my name, but if you are aggressive and threaten then that's what upsets me.", "So essentially they\u2019re issuing an ultimatum with these premises:\n\n1) how dare you take your fianc\u00e9s name a reaction that didn\u2019t simmer down and which caused you to uninvite them from the wedding\n2) if you follow through with uninviting them, they will never speak to you again \n\nIf it was me, I\u2019d ask them if this is the hill they want to die on ie \u201cdo you really never want to speak to your son over being uninvited to my wedding? And do you really want the reason for both of those things to be my fairly innocuous decision to take my partner\u2019s surname?\u201d\n\nIf their answer to both of those is yes, then ask yourself if YOU want to die on that hill. Given how your fianc\u00e9 feels about it, maybe it is, but you can always consider backing down and taking the high road, for now, until things simmer down and you guys can all talk like adults.", "Depends on your culture and generation I guess but OP even said that fianc\u00e9s family were prepared for the fallout because it wasn\u2019t the norm (ops words not mine)", "And they\u2019ve apologised? Sorry what more can they do and more importantly what you want them to do? If you want to go no contact then that\u2019s your decision but you need to work out what they can do to make you happy. Otherwise this whole question is null and void because you\u2019ve already decided that an apology isn\u2019t enough so you\u2019ve already decided no contact in future."]}
