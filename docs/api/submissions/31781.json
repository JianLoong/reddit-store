He was always working and going on business trips. My aunt and grandma took care of mom. About 5 months after my mother's passing my dad introduced me to his new girlfriend. I was pissed. I yelled at him how quickly he moved on from mom when they decided to tell me they had been in a relationship for 3 years. My dad had been cheating on my mom while she was dying. His business trips were to meet his affair partner. I was so angry I packed my stuff and left his house. I haven't spoken to him since that day.  \n\n\nCurrently I am 25. The only family I speak to is an aunt who helped me when I left my dad's house. A few days ago my aunt called me, asked me how I was and then asked me if I heard from dad. I said why would I hear from him again. My aunt said dad is getting married to his affair partner and by going to his wedding it would help us mend our relationship. I said why would I do that. He is dead to me. There was a silence on the phone for a bit before my dad replied asking if that was what I felt about him. I immediately cut the call when I heard his voice. I realized he was with my aunt when she made the call to me. I texted my aunt telling her I asked her not tell dad anything about me and she agreed back then. She texted me back saying I was an asshole for saying what I said and my dad is crushed hearing that and that I should move on by now. I did not want to argue with someone who helped me so I blocked her.  \n\n\nOver the next 2 days, I got sent a wedding invitation to my mail box. The only person in the family who knew my address was my aunt. And she gave my number to various members of the family. I am being bombarded with calls and texts from dad, uncles, cousins, aunts saying I should give him a chance and come to the wedding. Some calling me names for saying what I said. I got a text from the affair partner saying my dad is thinking of postponing the wedding and I should just talk to him. (For context, the affair partner was a friend of my mom and knew she had cancer). I said its not my fault if he postpones the wedding. I don't want to have relationship with dad or her. They are trying to force it. It got quiet after that but being told by so many people from my dad's side I am an asshole did leave me conflicted but I am sticking to my guns. So AITA?  \n", "created_utc": 1701019870, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184fw9i/aita_for_not_going_to_the_wedding_of_my_dad_and/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Change your number. If you can move without telling anyone, do it. Because they're going to show up in person to confront you next. Get some security cameras in case someone tries to go nuts like trying to force their way into your home. They're all horrible people. Your dad and his AP are the worst. Both were close to your mom and did this to her. Ask AP what she would do if she got cancer and he did the same to her. Actually, don't bother, don't engage any of them.

They were enjoying themselves while your mother was dying, and didn't even have a lick of decency or care for you and your pain - by the fact that merely 5 months after your mother's death your father thought it was prime time to reveal his cheating partner to you. They care for nothing but themselves. In fact even if you don't forgive this man and woman for as long as you live, it's still understandable.\n\nAnd honestly I'm smelling a catch from this - either they're too old to have children or they find out they're infertile.

You have no obligation to be in anyone's life and are free to decide what you want to do and what you don't want to do.\n\nTell them very clearly you won't be attending, tell your aunt that you are disappointed/angry/whatever word you feel is appropriate that she gave out your number to those people, and then get a new phone number.

It is much kinder than going to the wedding and when they ask if anyone objects, calmly explaining why you object to their behavior. \n\nOP, there is no statute of limitations on feelings. You are allowed to decide how you feel for as long as you want to feel that way.", "This is succinct and to the point. \n\nOP, you experienced legitimate trauma in the last few years. Not only was your father absent during your mother\u2019s final days, but he was absent from you. YOU NEEDED COMFORT AND SUPPORT. You are well within your rights to be low or no contact with your father indefinitely. \n\nIt is not up to other people to decide what is best for you. You and only you can choose to reunite with your father. \n\nNTA\n\nKind thoughts to you, OP \u2764\ufe0f", "I don't think calling it a grudge is a fair reflection of the situation. Not wanting contact with someone who betrayed you so badly isn't a grudge, it's protecting yourself from further pain."]}
