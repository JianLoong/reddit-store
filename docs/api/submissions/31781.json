He was always working and going on business trips. My aunt and grandma took care of mom. About 5 months after my mother's passing my dad introduced me to his new girlfriend. I was pissed. I yelled at him how quickly he moved on from mom when they decided to tell me they had been in a relationship for 3 years. My dad had been cheating on my mom while she was dying. His business trips were to meet his affair partner. I was so angry I packed my stuff and left his house. I haven't spoken to him since that day.  \n\n\nCurrently I am 25. The only family I speak to is an aunt who helped me when I left my dad's house. A few days ago my aunt called me, asked me how I was and then asked me if I heard from dad. I said why would I hear from him again. My aunt said dad is getting married to his affair partner and by going to his wedding it would help us mend our relationship. I said why would I do that. He is dead to me. There was a silence on the phone for a bit before my dad replied asking if that was what I felt about him. I immediately cut the call when I heard his voice. I realized he was with my aunt when she made the call to me. I texted my aunt telling her I asked her not tell dad anything about me and she agreed back then. She texted me back saying I was an asshole for saying what I said and my dad is crushed hearing that and that I should move on by now. I did not want to argue with someone who helped me so I blocked her.  \n\n\nOver the next 2 days, I got sent a wedding invitation to my mail box. The only person in the family who knew my address was my aunt. And she gave my number to various members of the family. I am being bombarded with calls and texts from dad, uncles, cousins, aunts saying I should give him a chance and come to the wedding. Some calling me names for saying what I said. I got a text from the affair partner saying my dad is thinking of postponing the wedding and I should just talk to him. (For context, the affair partner was a friend of my mom and knew she had cancer). I said its not my fault if he postpones the wedding. I don't want to have relationship with dad or her. They are trying to force it. It got quiet after that but being told by so many people from my dad's side I am an asshole did leave me conflicted but I am sticking to my guns.

Oh also metion to the AP that she better not get sick or Dad will move on before her body's cold. Then move on to how everyone who supports this relationship are all AH. \n\nMick drop and move on.\n\nFor real though you are NTA. Do not let other mistakes define you. Do not take their shit either.

Both selfish bastards. \n\nNot only for what they did to your mother, abandoning her and  stabbing her in the back as she\u2019s dying - but what about you?? You were 15 to 17 years old.  Your mother is dying and your father is off galavanting with another woman. Did he not think about supporting v you continually?

Ask if he means it when talking about \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d this time around. Let all those fears run wild in their heads.", "NTA\n\nIn my country we say how \u201chappiness\u201d built on other people\u2019s tears will crumble.\nHaving had horrific experinces with my father and his affairs please OP go NC, it will be hard but you will get peace!\nWhen your mother was dying you and her both needed him and he goes and instead of holding her hand through this he sleeps with her friend.\nAnd the AF is equally evil too having slept with the man her dying friend was married to.\nIt may not seem like it now but soon enough karma will bite them in the ass and their \u201clove\u201d is not real and you will heal only\nif you distance yourself and stay firm in your boundries.\nAll of these stories with evil stepmothers remind me of Cinderella and Snowhite lmao", "Honey, you are NTA. No way. What your dad did was despicable. He abandoned you and your mom at the worst time. That his affair partner was your mom's friend makes her horrible too. You do not have to forgive them. Not now, not ever. That is solely your decision.\n\nI am old enough to be your grandmother. I would advise you to change your phone number. Do not give it to family. About the mail, you can write on it \"Return to sender\" and put it back in the box, or drop in a mailbox. I would do that for mail from any of them, if you don't want it.\n\nYou take care of you. You do not have to have a relationship with anyone you do not want. Call it an \"accident of birth\".\n\nGood luck, and take care. Hugs from grandma.", "NTA.  What a bunch of losers.  How dare your father leave your mother to die without him and her friend to sleep with your mother's husband!  Cut off everyone that thinks YOU need to apologize for his failure.", "I'd be posting on FB about how they were having an affair before your mum passed and leave them to deal with the consequences.", "NTA, you are a nicer person than I, if it was me I would have faked accepted the invitation, then made a scene at the wedding to let everyone know your dad and your mom's \"Friend\" started the affair as your mother was dying of cancer. Then cut all contact from there.", "ESH. Were they AHs for cheating on your mom? You bet. Is he an AH for wanting you at his wedding? Nope. You are his child, like it or not. Are you an AH for going NC with the cheaters? Not in the least. Is your aunt an AH for trying to force you to reconcile with your dad...yes.\n\nThe one thing I would do is ask the affair woman why she cheated with your dad when she had been a friend of your mother's. Cause that says lots about both of them.", "NTA. What your dad and his affair partner did was unforgivable, and your aunt owes you an apology for giving out your contact information without your permission.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. He did a shitty thing and as a consequence, you don\u2019t want a relationship with him. \n\nNow there are consequences to your decisions too, but as long as you\u2019re okay with them, then I don\u2019t see any issue with you sticking ti your guns on this.", "Genuinely OP is being so good. My blood boils reading this. Personally, I'd act like an ahole. Pretend I reconsidered. And then at the wedding blast them both for the absolutely vile and terrible people they are, and wish them the same marriage, loyalty and happiness as OPs mother experienced. Then I'd finish of by telling him either that I hate him or I feel nothing for him, and that I will never forgive him. I would not care that that's an asshole thing to do.\n\nBut OPs way is much healthier so I do support that, well done. There is just no way OP is an asshole.", "More than that, he cheated with his wife's friend. Dad burned his bridges four years ago after setting the first fires seven years ago, he's not mending them with OP.", "OP would be perfectly entitled to tell people 'He is dead to me, you can be as well if you ignore my wishes.' \n\nIt may be other people don't know he cheated but his 17 year old child left his home and hasn't spoken to him in 7 years, it should be obvious he did something very wrong.", "This \ud83d\udcaf percent! Sorry you are going through this. Your family cannot tell you how to grieve and how to feel. They suck. Go NC with them all.", "I agree. Block the whole bunch.", "This. Your dad abandoned you and your mother at one of the most vulnerable times of your lives. He doesn't get you back for what he considers to be the good times. If AP calls back ask her what she thinks is going to happen when things get rough in their own relationship. \n\nNTA", "Not sure if someone else has noted this:\n\nYes, das cheated on mom while she was dying. That\u2019s bad.\nI find it even more appealing that das left OP - his child - alone again and again during the 2 years where OPs mum died. Instead of being there for his child he abandoned them and left them alone with slowly loosing their mum.\nTHAT I find as despicable as cheating on his wife. So NTA, why would OP want a relationship with their father?", "not to nit-pick, but sounds they were in a relationship before the cancer.", "Or, since your aunt is happy to give your private information out to people you have expressed you do NOT want having it - I would CERTAINLY 'not'' Dox said lovely aunt. \nSign her number and address up to as much junk and spam as you can. Tit for tat, she wants to introduce bullshit in your life, you can give a little back.", "Honestly, what he did is 1000 times worse than what OP is doing. Not only lying and cheating, but essentially abandoning his dying wife while doing so. People are allowed to make their decisions in life, but they also must accept the natural consequences of those decisions. OP doesn\u2019t owe him any more than he seemed to think he owed their mom. I also have cancer (treatable not curable). The support and love I get from my husband is what keeps me going and helps me live each day with gratitude. To think that she didn\u2019t have this while dying makes me so sad. At least she didn\u2019t know about the affair. Hopefully, anyway.", "This! Amen! He already taught her what family and loyalty means.  Not a damn thing.", "I really don\u2019t know why the AP bothers to marry the man anyway - she already watched him discard the whole of his last set of vows (including the \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d). What\u2019s the point of marrying when neither of them believe in honoring such promises in the first place?", "Op didn't try to police everyone else s relationship with her father she just didn't and doesn't want anything to do with him.\n\nHuge ah everyone for harassing her", "OP is old enough that dad might be thinking of how he's fucked up and won't see any grandkids.", "Or AP is pergnat. In which case it\u2019s just another kid for him to disappoint when they need him the most.", "Seconding this. I am estranged from my paternal family because they\u2019re shitty people. As a result I can spend all my family time with awesome people who treat me well.", "I guess OP could go and make a fake, gushy toast telling the truth about couple's \"love story\", then drop the mic \ud83c\udfa4 and walk out. Those despicable people deserve to have their wedding ruined.", "[removed]", "She could do the slides on social media. Expose them for the shitty assholes they are.", "Yeah, I'm wondering if OP can get a restraining order, or at least a cease and desist letter.", "Nice idea. \ud83d\udc4d", "Keep up the grey rocking, throwing a rock into the hornet's nest is just making things worse and costs OP the moral high ground.", "They are both Judas level evil I can\u2019t wait for them both to get what is coming for them", "exactly, he made no attempts to at least try to fix their relationship but thought that somehow after years of no contact, she would go to their wedding. Can anyone really be that delusional?", "Not having other relatives isn\u2019t a good enough reason to maintain contact with these people if op doesn\u2019t want to.  The ambush is shitty and so is giving op a hard time.  He effectively abandoned op and op\u2019s mother when he needed them the most", "That's petty as fuck, and I love it.", "> I do judge you for still being this upset about it 8 years later, your father probably moved on emotionally and physically the moment he knew she was terminal. Lots of men do, that doesn\u2019t make it right but a lot of times that\u2019s what happens.\n\nOkay. Well, OP probably decided her asshole dad was dead to her the moment she realized the depth of his betrayal. Lots of kids in this situation do. A lot of times that\u2019s what happens.", "It's clear OP has given up on getting, or indeed wanting, anything from their father.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
