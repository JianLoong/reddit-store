He was always working and going on business trips. My aunt and grandma took care of mom. About 5 months after my mother's passing my dad introduced me to his new girlfriend. I was pissed. I yelled at him how quickly he moved on from mom when they decided to tell me they had been in a relationship for 3 years. My dad had been cheating on my mom while she was dying. His business trips were to meet his affair partner. I was so angry I packed my stuff and left his house. I haven't spoken to him since that day.  \n\n\nCurrently I am 25. The only family I speak to is an aunt who helped me when I left my dad's house. A few days ago my aunt called me, asked me how I was and then asked me if I heard from dad. I said why would I hear from him again. My aunt said dad is getting married to his affair partner and by going to his wedding it would help us mend our relationship. I said why would I do that. He is dead to me. There was a silence on the phone for a bit before my dad replied asking if that was what I felt about him. I immediately cut the call when I heard his voice. I realized he was with my aunt when she made the call to me. I texted my aunt telling her I asked her not tell dad anything about me and she agreed back then. She texted me back saying I was an asshole for saying what I said and my dad is crushed hearing that and that I should move on by now. I did not want to argue with someone who helped me so I blocked her.  \n\n\nOver the next 2 days, I got sent a wedding invitation to my mail box. The only person in the family who knew my address was my aunt. And she gave my number to various members of the family. I am being bombarded with calls and texts from dad, uncles, cousins, aunts saying I should give him a chance and come to the wedding. Some calling me names for saying what I said. I got a text from the affair partner saying my dad is thinking of postponing the wedding and I should just talk to him. (For context, the affair partner was a friend of my mom and knew she had cancer). I said its not my fault if he postpones the wedding. I don't want to have relationship with dad or her. They are trying to force it. It got quiet after that but being told by so many people from my dad's side I am an asshole did leave me conflicted but I am sticking to my guns.

Oh also metion to the AP that she better not get sick or Dad will move on before her body's cold. Then move on to how everyone who supports this relationship are all AH. \n\nMick drop and move on.\n\nFor real though you are NTA. Do not let other mistakes define you. Do not take their shit either.

Both selfish bastards. \n\nNot only for what they did to your mother, abandoning her and  stabbing her in the back as she\u2019s dying - but what about you?? You were 15 to 17 years old.  Your mother is dying and your father is off galavanting with another woman. Did he not think about supporting v you continually?

Drop'em and block'em - all of them,you don't need that kind of abuse in your life.\n\nAlso, this smells fishy... Are they too old to have children, or are they infertile?

Tell them if the harassment doesn\u2019t stop you will go to the police.  Get cameras in case they decide to come to your house.
