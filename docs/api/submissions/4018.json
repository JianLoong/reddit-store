First YTA is because you should have been getting Rory help for his dependency issues.  He didn't want to be parted from Emily when you moved into your new home and he really struggled with that.  The fact that you state : \"eventually adapted to the new reality and has been more stable.\"  Has me concerned.  Do you know for a fact that he HAS adapted to the new reality.  The fact that he isn't pissing himself or crying at night doesn't mean that he necessarily has.    \n\n\nSecond YTA is because you are babying Rory.  Yes, I said you should be getting him help above but giving him his own hotel room isn't that help.  Your daughter isn't being difficult by requesting her own hotel room since that is what you are giving Rory.  She wants you to treat them equally and in the scenario she isn't wrong.  There is literally no reason that Rory can't share a room with one of his stepbrothers or his cousin.  Smell is not a good reason.  Forcing Emily to room with him isn't fair either.  She isn't the one with the problem.  She was perfectly fine rooming with her cousin UNTIL you gave her brother his own room.  So again the problem is RORY and YOU.     \nFor me there is only 3 somewhat plausible reasons for your sons behavior:  1) He has dependency issues where he feels like Emily is the only stable thing in his life and he doesn't want to be apart from her.  2) He is fixated on Emily in a weird romatic/sexual way (this is the least likely reason). 3) He still is crying at night and/or wetting the bed.  In that case he wouldn't want to room with anyone other than Emily because he believes he would be made fun of for it.  The \"smell\" excuse could literally be him projecting his bedwetting smell onto them.    \n\n\nRealized that actually there is a 3rd YTA for you...the fact that you didn't consider another rooming option...having him share with you and your husband.  Rory could sleep on the floor or in a cot, since he was apt to sleep in the rainforest if he couldn't room with Emily or have his own.  But I supposed much like his crying and bedwetting when you moved, it would be a HUGE inconvenience to you.", "YTA for giving in to your son's tantrums. Also, he's 12 -- I'm sure he doesn't smell great. Also, 12 is too young to be alone in his own hotel room.", "INFO - do all these people your son refused to share a room with actually smell horrible?", "I applaud you for taking your child\u2019s feelings in to consideration, but this is just a vacation. This is a very typical sleeping arrangement when on vacation. Paying for a whole other room for a single child is not what you would expect to do. Maybe get him some type of pop up tent or something to give him some privacy. I remember one year sleeping in a closet when on vacation just to get some space as a kid. \n\nYour are NAH for considering your child\u2019s feelings but you can\u2019t accommodate him by getting his own room, but you can talk to him and come up with another solution to make things work. The best thing to do here is to teach him coping strategies to deal with things that you\u2019re uncomfortable with, stressed out about, and nervous about. If you accommodate everything that makes him uncomfortable in his life, you\u2019re not preparing him for the real world when he grows up, and would be then the AH.", "ESH.\n\nEmily is being a brat if she only wants her own room if Rory gets one, and at the same time refuses to share a room with Rory.\n\nRory is using the \"they smell bad\" excuse to get his own room.  What is REALLY happening is that he doesn't feel comfortable sharing a room with relative strangers (or strange relatives).  This could be a puberty thing or not, but he is being an AH to cause all this trouble.\n\nAnd you are being AH by allowing your kids to make such demands and cost you unnecessary expense.\n\nAt 12, it is reasonable if Emily does not want to share a room with a boy. Rory can pick between the step brother and the cousin, but that's it.   (If he insists on his own room, he can pay for it out of his allowance for the next X years.)\n\nEDIT TO CLARIFY:  **Rory and OP are the AH, not Emily.

Lots of kids share room because there are not more rooms. Being upset by change is not inherently unhealthy or a sign of something wrong, kids are just used to routine. It could be a sign of something though. I shared a room with my brother until I was 11. My brother was nervous sleeping alone and didn't want to so the bunk bed stayed in my room for a while. My brother has night terrors and that's why he was scared. Once my parents found out and helped he slowly started sleeping in his own room. It wasn't a weird puberty thing he was a scared kid.
