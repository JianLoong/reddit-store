Rory says that he doesn't want to share a room with none of his stepbrothers because they smell bad. He told me to allow him to stay with his sister but Emily doesn't want that.

First YTA is because you should have been getting Rory help for his dependency issues.  He didn't want to be parted from Emily when you moved into your new home and he really struggled with that.  The fact that you state : \"eventually adapted to the new reality and has been more stable.\"  Has me concerned.  Do you know for a fact that he HAS adapted to the new reality.  The fact that he isn't pissing himself or crying at night doesn't mean that he necessarily has.    \n\n\nSecond YTA is because you are babying Rory.  Yes, I said you should be getting him help above but giving him his own hotel room isn't that help.  Your daughter isn't being difficult by requesting her own hotel room since that is what you are giving Rory.  She wants you to treat them equally and in the scenario she isn't wrong.  There is literally no reason that Rory can't share a room with one of his stepbrothers or his cousin.  Smell is not a good reason.  Forcing Emily to room with him isn't fair either.  She isn't the one with the problem.  She was perfectly fine rooming with her cousin UNTIL you gave her brother his own room.  So again the problem is RORY and YOU.     \nFor me there is only 3 somewhat plausible reasons for your sons behavior:  1) He has dependency issues where he feels like Emily is the only stable thing in his life and he doesn't want to be apart from her.  2) He is fixated on Emily in a weird romatic/sexual way (this is the least likely reason). 3) He still is crying at night and/or wetting the bed.  In that case he wouldn't want to room with anyone other than Emily because he believes he would be made fun of for it.  The \"smell\" excuse could literally be him projecting his bedwetting smell onto them.    \n\n\nRealized that actually there is a 3rd YTA for you...the fact that you didn't consider another rooming option...having him share with you and your husband.  Rory could sleep on the floor or in a cot, since he was apt to sleep in the rainforest if he couldn't room with Emily or have his own.  But I supposed much like his crying and bedwetting when you moved, it would be a HUGE inconvenience to you.", "YTA for giving in to your son's tantrums. Also, he's 12 -- I'm sure he doesn't smell great. Also, 12 is too young to be alone in his own hotel room.", "INFO - do all these people your son refused to share a room with actually smell horrible?", "I applaud you for taking your child\u2019s feelings in to consideration, but this is just a vacation. This is a very typical sleeping arrangement when on vacation. Paying for a whole other room for a single child is not what you would expect to do. Maybe get him some type of pop up tent or something to give him some privacy. I remember one year sleeping in a closet when on vacation just to get some space as a kid. \n\nYour are NAH for considering your child\u2019s feelings but you can\u2019t accommodate him by getting his own room, but you can talk to him and come up with another solution to make things work. The best thing to do here is to teach him coping strategies to deal with things that you\u2019re uncomfortable with, stressed out about, and nervous about. If you accommodate everything that makes him uncomfortable in his life, you\u2019re not preparing him for the real world when he grows up, and would be then the AH.", "ESH.\n\nEmily is being a brat if she only wants her own room if Rory gets one, and at the same time refuses to share a room with Rory.\n\nRory is using the \"they smell bad\" excuse to get his own room.  What is REALLY happening is that he doesn't feel comfortable sharing a room with relative strangers (or strange relatives).  This could be a puberty thing or not, but he is being an AH to cause all this trouble.\n\nAnd you are being AH by allowing your kids to make such demands and cost you unnecessary expense.\n\nAt 12, it is reasonable if Emily does not want to share a room with a boy.

The only reason that daughter is angry is because her brother is getting special UNDESERVED treatment.  Daughter didn't put up a fight to share a room with her cousin originally, her brother did put up the fight.  In fact OP stated that the daughter is the only one her son WOULD share a room with. Daughter didn't want to share a room with him and that makes sense, she is a pre-teen girl and would rather share with another girl (in this case the cousin she doesn't know).  OP needs to figure out why her son wants to share a room with his sister so badly, because that is the crux of the situation.

I don\u2019t think the son is trying to sneak a peek at his sister.\n\nAlso, both the children are complaining about wanting their own rooms, so they should both share or they can go back to their original assignments.

On her own, she could only afford for her twins to share a room. Once married, the two sets of twins each have their own room.

I don't know what you were trying to say there. Lot's of marriages have age gaps. So what. They moved to a bigger house? Yeah because they have 2 incomes now. Begging for the room?

Instead of giving an entire new hotel room to OP's son, OP should say \"your sister can manage, follow her example\". Children are always told to follow the example of the grown ups and of their older siblings/cousins, but when it comes to the boy/girl thing, all of a sudden, there is no more \"do what the more mature one does\", but \"it's hard to be a boy, ya know....their brains, you know\".\n\n> But the snark and assumption in the comment that I replied to, and your own bashing of a child being a child compelled me to respond.

You meant \"they are jumping to conclusions\".", "Exactly she didn't beg for a single room for her daughter. And if the boys obviously smell that's an issue that should be dealt with. If OP's son is non neurotypical in some way OP and husband should be dealing with that. Maybe that does mean a separate room but this whole story would or should be different if that was a known issue."]}
