All we have here is the current situation colored by OPs bias, so I'd be careful inferring what their family life actually looks like.", "It takes a village. It always took a village. Part of growing up with siblings has always meant taking responsibility for them as you grew up. It's just that actually having siblings (and more than one or two) has become so rare in our society that we're not used to it anymore. \n\nSure, society changes, but it's still pretty weird that asking older children to watch younger ones so the family can function has become something that young people consider an near-unbearable imposition, an infringment on their right to absolute self-absorption.", "If the daughter is going to a college interview, then she can drive back.", "Lol some of y'all never had to pick up your sick kid from summer camp six hours away and it shows. \n\n(Just teasing, lol, I agree only one parent was needed)", "And things change, a college interview trumps birthday", "Yeah I mean personally I'm someone who thinks we all deserve one day a year to be selfish and do what we want , and that's our birthday.", "Yes because a lot of thing that were normal are actually morally questionable and possibly abusive. If you cant raise your children without relying on your older children then dont have more children. Allow those older children to be children and young adults figuring out life. \n\nOf course we are getting a biased story from op. Thats what all of these aita post are. Thats why I said \u201cI wonder\u201d. We didn\u2019t get background in to op childhood. \n\nEveryone answered here is biased based on their own lives and beliefs.", "The child being forced to take care of their siblings is parentification\u2013which is abuse. Again one parent could very well stay home or they could take THEIR children with them. They just DON'T want to, so again it takes a village is bullshit because this is simply OP'S parents not wanting to take care of the children they chose to have. THEY chose to have thae kids therefore they are THEIR responsibility and not anyone else's point blank.", "I\u2019m not sure if some adults get that advantage. People go to work in their birthdays and a mom never stops being a mom on her birthday. What I\u2019m saying is that sometimes you can celebrate it another day, with the same people. But there are things that are sometimes more important like the college interview on that day.", "I can guarantee you that at some point in your family's history, some of your ancestors did rely on relatives other than their parents to stay alive. And I can guarantee you that at some point in your family's history, your ancestors were among the younger siblings of the bunch.\n\nCommunity, society only works when people, families and friends, stick together and share the burden of raising children. It's always a group effort, only that instead of only relying on a close-knit group of people like family and next-door neighbors, we have started relying on infrastructure provided by a state to outsorce some parts of it, like, for example, higher education.\n\nTaking care of family is how humanity survived and evolved, and it's fairly hypocritical to cry \"abuse! How dare!\" when we all only exist because of it.\n\nIf you consider the way humans exist as social beings within a community, formed by families sticking together and sharing responsibilties, abusive because it limits everyone's personal freedom to some degree, then I guess I can't really help you.", "Its not op fault that their parents dont trust anyone else to watch their kids. They refuse to build a village and made their older kids the village to help raise their kids."]}
