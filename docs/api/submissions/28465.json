Despite this, i\u2019ve never asked her to watch them, clean up after them, feed them, or do anything with them. They\u2019re *my* dogs. \n\nRecently she told me that she wants to get more involved with them since she calls them Her dogs, and she posts pictures about how much she loves \u2018her dogs\u2019 and things like that. \n\nI thought it would be good for them to have another person they could trust, and it would be good for me because as a full time student with a job, it\u2019s hard to take care of them all the time.\n\nThe other day, I woke up at 6:30 to go to the gym one of my classes was moved around so I needed to go earlier. The dogs are usually fed at 7. I texted her and asked if she would feed them at 7, she said yes. \n\nI got home around 8 and they were barking and their bowls were empty. I went to her room to ask if she fed them. she said she forgot. I didn\u2019t care too much, it was a mistake. I was just mildly annoyed, so I fed them and went about my day. \n\nA few days after, she asked to take them on their walk. Which was great for me because that meant I could do some overtime.\nI agreed and showed her where everything was. But when I got home from work around midnight, the dogs were sitting by the door, they ran over to their leashes and harnesses. So I asked if she took them on a walk (she was sitting on the couch) and she told me she was going to but it was too cold out for her so she didn\u2019t. It was 15\u00b0C (60\u00b0F). So I took them out at midnight. If I didn\u2019t they wouldn\u2019t have slept.\n\nNow, this morning. I decided to give her one more chance because I had an early class (Usually on these days i\u2019ll just feed them before I leave, but when I make their breakfast I warm it up for them and I feel bad leaving it out to get cold). \n\nI knocked on her door at 6am before I left for the gym. She told me she would feed them at 7. I had to go right from the gym to school or else i\u2019d be late. I told her that. Saying I wouldn\u2019t be there if she forgot to feed them. She rolled her eyes and said \u201cIm an adult, I know how to feed dogs\u201d.\n\nI got home at 3:15pm. The dogs were laying by their bowls. So I went to her room (she\u2019s home all day, remote job). When I got there, I asked if she fed the dogs and she said \u201cOhh that\u2019s what I was forgetting. Can you do it since you\u2019re home now?\u201d\n\nI got mad at her and basically told her she was incompetent and that i hope she never gets a pet of her own because it will die. \n\nNow her friends are texting me and telling me I was too harsh\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR- My roommate asked to be more involved in my dogs lives then forgot to feed them, didn\u2019t take them on their walk then forgot to feed them again and they didn\u2019t get fed until over eight hours past their usual time because I was at school. I called her incompetent and now her friends are mad at me.\n\nEdit/Info:\nI only felt comfortable taking overtime and shifting my class schedule around BECAUSE my roommate had said she would help me. My dogs are very well taken care of with 3 homemade meals (they\u2019re on a raw diet, but I gave my roommate detailed instructions), two walks, an hour of play time a day.

I\u2019m disabled and have terrible chronic pain but I still found ways to take our dog out for small walks when he was alive (he was a senior pup when my partner and I met) and I NEVER forgot to feed him even when I was in the bathroom constantly throwing up and passing out.

You\u2019re not even able to feed them at consistent hours because your schedule is so full.

Gaslighting is when you make a person disbelieve their own perception - eg, telling them that they must have been imagining sounds, you\u2019ve been silent when they complain about the noise of your tv or music.

Not only will you know it, so will others lol", "Vets really have almost no education on canine nutrition.  You want to get dietary advice from a veterinary nutritionist, not a vet.  I was confused by how utterly useless my vet was dealing with my dogs diets - they both have/had (one has since passed) allergies and sensitive digestive tracts, and seriously the only solution one vet had to offer is a crappy, expensive \u201chypoallergenic\u201d prescription diet.  When I did some research, it turns out that at absolute best, vets might get a half day covering dietary needs for all common domesticated animals (both pets and food animals), with many programs not even addressing the subject at all.  I ended up doing a lot of research myself to try to find ways to keep my dogs fed without triggering allergies or food sensitivities in either of them while still giving them adequate nutrition, and the only good source for that info is veterinary nutritionists.\n\nDoctors are much the same way with human nutrition, unfortunately.", "NTA.

Okay- I have to be able to trust you when you commit to these things. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for this. My dogs can remain my dogs and I\u2019ll take on their care as usual. Maybe we can try again another time.\u201d \n\nFrankly it was always going to be a slippery slope here, if you let her call them hers and allowed her to take on a significant portion of their care.

Honestly if she doesn't want to do these things that you are asking her to do then what's the point of having her around if you can't trust her.
