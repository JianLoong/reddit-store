We rent a house together. (sorry for the format, i\u2019m on mobile)\n\nI have two dogs. I got them when I moved in (they\u2019re about a year), they\u2019ve been with both her and I since they were puppies. Despite this, i\u2019ve never asked her to watch them, clean up after them, feed them, or do anything with them. They\u2019re *my* dogs. \n\nRecently she told me that she wants to get more involved with them since she calls them Her dogs, and she posts pictures about how much she loves \u2018her dogs\u2019 and things like that. \n\nI thought it would be good for them to have another person they could trust, and it would be good for me because as a full time student with a job, it\u2019s hard to take care of them all the time.\n\nThe other day, I woke up at 6:30 to go to the gym one of my classes was moved around so I needed to go earlier. The dogs are usually fed at 7. I texted her and asked if she would feed them at 7, she said yes. \n\nI got home around 8 and they were barking and their bowls were empty. I went to her room to ask if she fed them. she said she forgot. I didn\u2019t care too much, it was a mistake. I was just mildly annoyed, so I fed them and went about my day. \n\nA few days after, she asked to take them on their walk. Which was great for me because that meant I could do some overtime.\nI agreed and showed her where everything was. But when I got home from work around midnight, the dogs were sitting by the door, they ran over to their leashes and harnesses. So I asked if she took them on a walk (she was sitting on the couch) and she told me she was going to but it was too cold out for her so she didn\u2019t. It was 15\u00b0C (60\u00b0F). So I took them out at midnight. If I didn\u2019t they wouldn\u2019t have slept.\n\nNow, this morning. I decided to give her one more chance because I had an early class (Usually on these days i\u2019ll just feed them before I leave, but when I make their breakfast I warm it up for them and I feel bad leaving it out to get cold). \n\nI knocked on her door at 6am before I left for the gym. She told me she would feed them at 7. I had to go right from the gym to school or else i\u2019d be late. I told her that. Saying I wouldn\u2019t be there if she forgot to feed them. She rolled her eyes and said \u201cIm an adult, I know how to feed dogs\u201d.\n\nI got home at 3:15pm. The dogs were laying by their bowls. So I went to her room (she\u2019s home all day, remote job). When I got there, I asked if she fed the dogs and she said \u201cOhh that\u2019s what I was forgetting. Can you do it since you\u2019re home now?\u201d\n\nI got mad at her and basically told her she was incompetent and that i hope she never gets a pet of her own because it will die. \n\nNow her friends are texting me and telling me I was too harsh\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR- My roommate asked to be more involved in my dogs lives then forgot to feed them, didn\u2019t take them on their walk then forgot to feed them again and they didn\u2019t get fed until over eight hours past their usual time because I was at school.

Which is a red flag. What makes this worse is that she keeps promising otherwise. And will even tell you in an arrogant way that she is competent enough to do it. \n\nImagine this. What is she doing when the dogs are barking? Because dogs will bark when they don't get their food or have to go pee outside. She hears this, it's an immediate reminder for her. But apparently she can't make the link to the promise she made with you. Which is something I have a really hard time believing unless there are drugs or severe brain damage involved here. Which I don't think if she works from hime. \n\nAnd then she sets her friends up against you. That's really the finishing touch. That woman can't own up to her mistakes.

She likes to pretend that the dogs are hers for social media (uggh), but is too self absorbed to remember to feed them or take them for a walk when she promised she would even though they are literally right in front of her. She has no excuse except for she doesn't really give enough of a fuck, unless perhaps this is an unmanaged ADHD thing or something? But still. Write yourself a damned note, set an alarm / phone reminder.", "NTA she is terrible. OP she has proven multiple times you cannot count on her, so don\u2019t ever again. She is very immature for promising these things and not flowing through", "So you have three dogs?", "NTA. If her friends come at you, then just reiterate the facts. \"They're not her dogs, they're mine. She asked to help take care of them, and the times I let her attempt to, she made them suffer. They starved all day because she 'forgot'. So you're mad at me because I'm not letting her abuse my pets anymore - MY pets, not hers? Do you want to trust her to take care of your animals? Probably not, because she's shown with mine she can't be assed to feed and water them. But hey, if you want to let her starve yours, go ahead. Let her abuse your pets. Then come tell me that I'm overreacting.\"", "NTA. It's not a matter of whose dogs they were. She said she'd do a thing THREE TIMES and THREE TIMES she did not do the thing. To make it worse, her not doing the thing THREE TIMES made animals suffer. You were harsh yes, but she suffered less than what she inflicted on those dogs.", "Yes your the asshole. It\u2019s never that serious. Have your dogs pay rent.", "NTA what the fuck is her problem with the pretending[*edited from previously saying: gaslighting] and neglecting the dogs?? Iota extremely unfair and there\u2019s no way she didn\u2019t leave her room at ANY point for food/water/bathroom herself, so she really wants to pretend she didn\u2019t look at those dogs by their food bowls or inside all day and not once thought they might need care??? I\u2019m disabled and have terrible chronic pain but I still found ways to take our dog out for small walks when he was alive (he was a senior pup when my partner and I met) and I NEVER forgot to feed him even when I was in the bathroom constantly throwing up and passing out. I genuinely don\u2019t understand the consistent complete neglect when it\u2019s clear she knows they\u2019re there from showing them off??? I\u2019m clearly mad on your behalf now oops lmao again, not the asshole IMO", "NTA. Your issue isn't really that your roommate didn't feed the dogs. Your issue is that she's a liar.\n\nYou've listed three cases where she told you that she would do things she knew were important to you and then didn't do them. Stop relying on her, tell your friends that the problem is that she lied to you, and plan to move out when the lease ends.", "NTA - pets require responsibility and diligence. I think offer her the chance to show she learned", "ESH.\n\nYou\u2019re N T A for being mad at your unreliable roommate, but let\u2019s be real here: it sounds like you got dogs that you don\u2019t actually have the time to care for properly.  You\u2019re not even able to feed them at consistent hours because your schedule is so full.  If you had gotten them with a trusted person who was going to be able to help you from the start, that would be different.  But it sounds like you\u2019re not really in a place in your life where you can be a good owner.", "NTA she is unreliable and has proved so. I would tell the friends to stop contacting you because of what she did and list. Tell them if they care so much then they can trust her with their pets or get her one.", "NTA. She's unreliable and then being a brat about it. Sounds like she likes the idea of dogs and not the actual work that comes with taking care of them. I wouldn't let her take pictures with them anymore either if you can control that.", "Dude, there was no gaslighting here.  Gaslighting is when you make a person disbelieve their own perception - eg, telling them that they must have been imagining sounds, you\u2019ve been silent when they complain about the noise of your tv or music.  Roommate is irresponsible and breaks her promise to help, but she\u2019s not trying to break OP\u2019s sense of reality.", "Okay"]}
