Our 10 year old, Rose, has leukemia. A lot of the activities around the cabin are outdoors and Rose doesn't usually have the energy for that, so one of her favorite activities has been watching the wildlife from this big window seat in the master bedroom and taking pictures of what she sees. \n\nHer goal since she started doing this was to see a bear. There are some in the area but it's not too common to see one. She has me take her up to the window seat after dinner and usually falls asleep watching for bears. \n\nTowards the end of the 3 weeks, I had to take her to the hospital for chemo. 3.5 hours each way. That night she fell asleep in the window seat again and when I got up to carry her to bed, there were 2 bears close to our cabin. I called my wife over to see and I took a picture on Rose's iPad but my wife wanted to wake Rose up so she could see. She hadn't gotten to see a bear this trip. I told my wife she needs to rest and that showing her the picture would be enough but my wife still tried to wake her up. I stopped her again and got Rose in bed. The next morning I told Rose that there were bears last night and I showed her the picture. She asked if I woke her up. I said yes because I didn't want her to get upset but my wife told Rose that I wouldn't let anybody wake her up. We did not see any more bears for the rest of the trip and Rose has been devastated. She refuses to speak to me and deleted the pictures I took for her because apparently it doesn't count. She's even refusing to sleep next to me (she's been sleeping between me and my wife since she got sick) so my wife has had to sleep in Rose's room since the trip. My wife is even talking about taking Rose back to the cabin for a week to try to see a bear.\n\nI don't think it's a big deal but my wife and Rose are still upset with me so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1694059977, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c5zni/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_wife_wake_our/", "score": 2552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially as she's been looking forward to seeing a bear.\n\nSeeing a picture is not the same thing.", "YTA. The 20 or 30 mins she would be awake to see the bears would not have impacted her health. That would have been an amazing memory for her. You know it was wrong because you lied about it. Apologize and do better next time.", "Why are you wasting time get judgment from internet strangers when you could be attempting to arrange a bear meeting for your sick child with a wildlife or charity organization? YTA", "YTA. You knew your daughter has been trying to see a bear from that window for weeks. Your wife told you that you should wake her up to see it. You invalidated both of them and deprived your daughter of an experience she has been actively seeking. To top it off, you lied to your daughter that you did try to wake her up to see the bear when you did no such thing. The fact that you lied to her shows you already know what you did was wrong. Learn from this and do better going forward.", "YTA\n\nThe one thing the kid wanted and would make her happy, and not only did you stop it from happening, you lied about being the one to prevent it? Of course YTA.", "YTA.. imagine thinking a picture of a bear is enough. If that actually was accurate, we wouldn't have natural parks putting out warnings about staying AWAY from bears. Rose and your wife can go on a girl's trip to try to see a bear..btw, pics absolutely do NOT count. I am routing for Rose that she beats cancer and she sees some bears.", "YTA. Not only did you make the decision for your daughter, you made the decision to lie. Lying to your kid to save face means you KNOW you were being an asshole, you just didn\u2019t want to deal with the consequences.", "YTA. First of all, straight from the title, your wife has her own mind and doesn't need you to \"let\" her do something. Second, from not knowing that your daughter has seen a thousand pictures of bears so a picture of a bear is meaningless, and more so, almost cruel, \"Look! A bear was right there and you missed it!\" And Third, it would have been terrible if it had been any kid, but doubly because she didn't have any other fun thing to do on this trip. \n\nYour wife is right about taking her for another week. I'd do that. And apologize... a lot.", "YTA.\n\nYou decided for her. Even though your wife was clearly telling you that you were wrong.\n\nThen you disregarded your wife\u2019s opinion as well.\n\nAnd guess what - *you* were wrong.\n\nSo from this outsider\u2019s perspective, it looks like: \u201cMy female child does not really know what she wants. My female spouse does not know either. They don\u2019t really know their own minds - I know better.\u201d\n\nI really hope I\u2019m wrong. \n\nBut you might need to sit with this some and ask why you chose this\u2026\n\nAlso why lie about it? It either mattered (so wake her) or it didn\u2019t (so be honest).", "I started thinking YTA when I read the subject line. I kept thinking YTA as I read your post. It only got louder and louder ... like the roar of a bear. ***YTA!!!*** You deprived your child of one of the few things giving her joy at this time. All for a few extra minutes of sleep.", "YTA  you should have woken her up and if she was too tired she would have told you. You not only kept her from seeing them you then had the nerve to show her the picture which of course upset her. If you weren\u2019t gonna wake her up you should have never even mentioned the bears at all", "YTA\n\nYour sick child just wanted to see a bear.  You owe her a bear.", "YTA. Chill dude. Let the kid have her fun.", "YTA. \n\nThe health benefits from the mood boost she would've gotten are immeasurable.  Next time, trust your wife.", "YTA.  Wrapped up chemo with my 9-year-old 6 months ago and if there's one thing I know about those post infusion days, it sure is easy to get them back to sleep.", ">Rose has been devastated\n\n>I don't think it's a big deal\n\n\u2026 My heart just broke for your child. YTA. Unquestionably, undeniably, 100% YTA. This is a kid. She\u2019s going through so much right now and you denied her something so simple that would\u2019ve brought her joy, and don\u2019t care at all that you did or that you brought her even more pain and disappointment instead. She needed your support but I guess now she only has her mom, because you couldn\u2019t be bothered to give a shit.", "YTA but you already know that. You lied to your daughter about waking her up because you knew she would've wanted to wake up and see the bear. The time she didn't rest because she was looking at a bear would have been insignificant. Your daughter is sick and you denied her the one thing she wanted more than anything.", "If you didn\u2019t think it was a big deal and you didn\u2019t want anyone waking her up then you should\u2019ve stuck to your guns and told her that you didn\u2019t try to wake her up. The fact of the matter is that a tiny part of you knew that you were being a bit of an asshole denying your daughter something that she really wanted to experience. You didn\u2019t wake her up, you didn\u2019t let others wake her up, and then when asked whether or not you woke her up you blatantly lied to her. You\u2019re an asshole, mate.", "YTA. Cartoonishly so.", "YTA - the joy of seeing the bear would have far outweighed a missed hour of sleep.", "YTA. One for thinking you have the right to \"let your wife\" do anything. You aren't her boss, you don't own her so stop thinking she needs permission to do anything.\n\nYou knew the only thing your sick child wanted to do was see a bear. Your wife knew the only thing your sick child wanted to do was see a bear. You deprived your sick child out of seeing the one thing she really wanted to see and then you lie about it. Your wife was absolutely right to drop you in it on that one! \n\nYou owe your daughter a huge apology and have some real making up to do", "Why the fuck didn't you wake her up? \n\nDoes she have a hard time falling back asleep?\n\nSure would have LOVED to have been woken up to see those beats\n\nAnd then you said you did wake her up?  So you wouldn't look bad? \n\nyou KNOW YTA", "Why did you lie to Rose and say you tried to wake her?  Is it because you knew she would be upset that you denied her the chance to see a bear?\n\nYTA and a liar.", "Your sick kid wanted to see a bear so badly. \nBut you personally don't think it's a big deal.\nWtf? YTA. Jeez, poor kid.\n\nYou wouldn't have felt the need to lie to your daughter about having tried to wake her up, if you weren't the asshole. You know you are.", "Rose thinks YTA", "I think this is the Highest Level YTA i\u2019ve read. For not waking her up. For lying. I hope you won\u2019t regret this.", "YTA 100 times over\n\nIf you didn't think it was a big deal, why did you lie about it to her?   you knew it would upset her to know they were there and she missed out.   So did your wife which is why she wanted to wake her. \n\nShes sick for crying out loud. You deliberately chose to not make her happy.  Why would you do that? \n\nYou OP are a stubborn fool who has an ego in the way of his daughters happiness. Thank god your daughter has her mum who wants to see her happy.", "YTA, I don\u2019t have cancer but I\u2019m chronically ill and always exhausted especially from meds and treatment. my boyfriend tried not to wake me most the time unless an emergency or special occasion. this was a special occasion and I would have been over the moon to have something like that happen and I\u2019d definitely hold resentment to my father (in my younger days, I\u2019m 24 now) if he had me miss something so special", "YTA\n\nAlso, why are you sleeping alone in the big bed and rose and your wife sleeping in her small bed. You should be sleeping in the kids bed and if she doesn't want you sleeping in your room you should be sleeping on the sofa. You deprived your sick child of singing she really wanted that would not have cost you shutting. And you're wondering if you're an asshole.\n\nPlease facilitate your wife taking Rose to the cabin for however long it takes to see a bear. This is that only thing that will make this up to her. \n\nMeanwhile let them sleep in the masters and relegate yourself to the sofa.", "When my family was flying home from Canada, you could see the Northern Lights from the plane. My Mum didn't wake me up because she didn't think I would be interested. I am still salty about this decades later. And my Mum didn't know that it was something I desperately wanted to see. \n\nYou robbed your sick daughter of something she really wanted. Even if she was half asleep, it would have meant the world to her.  And if you're so convinced that it wasn't a big deal why did you try to lie to her about it? YTA", "YTA\n\nI can't be just me picking up the massive sexist attitude of this guy. \n\nThis dude doesn't allow his daughter to be awoken, then lies to her about it to protect himself. If it wasn't a big deal, why did you lie?", "YTA big time.  \n\n\nYou KNEW how much it meant to her. You KNEW how much she was hoping for it. And you said yourself she was devastated.  \n\n\nNo, a picture isn't 'enough'. I saw a baby bear on my porch when I was a child, and I have never forgotten it. If my mom had just taken a picture and shown me later I would have been PISSED, and it wasn't even my dream to see one. Imagine how your daughter feels, knowing that one of the people she loves and trusted withheld that experience from her?  \n\n\nListen to your wife. Listen to your *daughter.* Do anything you can to make this up to her. Bring her back to the cabin and try again.  \n\n\nAnd, normally, I would definitely not recommend trying to actually \\*attract\\* a bear, but... special circumstances. When I saw my first bear, it was because my mom and I had picked a whole bunch of apples, made apple cider, and we had an entire 5-gallon bucket full of apple scraps on our porch. So if what you have to do to make this up to your daughter is to go buy a juicer, a metric fuckton of apples, and a five-gallon bucket, then that just might be what you have to do. Plus cidermaking will be a fun, easy activity for your ill child, taste delicious, be good for her, and if you tell her the reason you're making cider is to attract bears she'll probably be super excited to make it and it'll be a great memory for her to have to know that you're actually trying to make things right, even if it doesn't end up working.", "YTA.\n\n1. Your wife was right; a picture was not enough \n2. You lied! You didn't try waking her up. It was your wife's idea to wake her up, you're the one who insisted it wasn't a big deal \n3. You now KNOW it was a big deal and are still refusing to take any accountability here", "YTA.  It's worrying that you need to ask.\n\nYou don't get to make the decisions.  Your wife is your partner, not your employee.  \n\nRose wanted to see a bear.  Your wife wanted her to see one.  Seeing one would mean waking up at night on ONE occasion.  \n\nAlso, you selfishly hauled Rose to a cabin despite her illness.  Interesting that she's well enough when you want to do what you want to do, but not when she is expressing what will make her happy.\n\nWaking up in the middle of the night probably would make her tired the next day but it wouldn't threaten her health.  It's strange that you have dug in over this.  My concern is what other selfish decisions you impose on everyone.", "YTA. I could have maybe understood it if she were already in bed and then you saw the bears\u2026 but she was RIGHT THERE!!\n\nYou then tried to lie to her when she asked if you tried to wake her because \u2018you didn\u2019t want to get her upset\u2019\u2026 come on! You KNOW YTA!", "YTA. The only thing she has enjoyed during that time was looking out that window and hoping she'd see something amazing. She had the opportunity to see something amazing and you took that from her. It's harsh, but she knows how sick she is and I don't doubt she's thinking \"what if I don't get another chance\".", "YTA, you know rose\u2019s goal was to see bears, you could have made her wish, yet you didn\u2019t, and you lied to her.", "You must already know YTA, because not only did you forbid your wife from waking you daughter up, you then LIED to your 10-year old. You deprived her of the one thing her sick and tired self was looking forward to. \n\nIf you knew you were doing the right thing, you wouldn't have had to lie about it. I hope you apologize to your wife and daughter and encourage them to go back to the cabin to make up for it.", "I wouldn't have said that YTA if all you did was to decide not to wake up your daughter.  My wife and I often have different level of protectiveness toward our kids, and it's all based on honest good intentions.  However, the fact that you lied to your daughter when she asked about you waking her up makes you a big A.  If you feel so strongly that your logic is correct, then you should have told her the truth right then and there, and why you didn't wake her up.In reality, in the back of your mind, you actually knew that if you didn't wake her up, or at least try, she would be unhappy. (or else why lie about it).  To me, you didn't want to do it because you didn't want your authority questioned by your wife, which is an asshole way to be.\n\nFinally, your final sentence, that you still didn't think it was a big deal, even after everything that was said by wife and daughter, that you are hope to find validations from a bunch of internet strangers, makes you a huge A!.\n\nYTA!", "My brother in christ, are you stupid? Is that the issue here? That you\u2019re just a moron?", "YTA", "You even gaslight your sick child to make yourself not look like the asshole.", "Your daughter is so upset that she won't have anything to do with you and you're here seeking validation from strangers? What is wrong with you? All you've done is show her that what she wants doesn't matter and you can't be trusted. YTA.", "YTA. Positive emotions are just as necessary as good sleep. You robbed her of experience of witnessing bears in their natural habitat, because you didn't think and still don't think it is important to her.", "YTA- Yes, chemo may take a lot out of her, but waking her up for  a small viewing of bears would have been the right thing to do. At least asking her would have been enough. If she was too tired, at least she got to say no.", "You don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal to deny your daughter with leukemia something that a) cost nothing and b) she clearly said she wanted? \n\nthis has to be fake but if not, yta", "YTA.And the photo made it worse.I would freaking cry all day and night if my dad would do something like that and then proceed to just show me the photo.", "How are you going to feel if your daughter dies and she never saw a bear because you decided a few minutes of sleep was more important? YTA and I hope your wife takes her back to see a bear", "Holy shit. She may never get that chance again. What you did is actually kind of evil. YTA.", "YTA\n\nSo on top of ruining your sick child's chances to see her favourite animal you also lied to her because you're such a coward? Damn", "YTA. Waking her up for a few minutes to see a bear wasn't going to affect her rest. She would go back to sleep and rest again anyway. This was her goal to see a bear, and you denier her of that.\n\nOther than, it sounds like you've been a great support so far. Try not to let one hiccup affect everything too much.", "YTA. And you already know that, otherwise you wouldn't have lied to your daughter. So you are actually a double arsehole: for not waken her, and especially for lying to her about it. Now she feels like she can't trust you, at a time in her life where she really needs to feel like she can rely on you. Apologies to her, explain why you lied, acknowledge you were wrong for doing that, and promise her not to lie to her anymore.", "This post made me so sad. I had a similar experience with a comet as a kid - I was waiting for this comet to go past at night and my mum promised she'd wake me up for it but didn't.", "YTA, if all she wanted was to see a bear why the fuck did you not wake her up to see the bears???", "The one thing she wanted was to see a bear. She is sick. I cannot imagine what that would be like at 10. I also don't know what it's like as a parent to watch your precious baby be ill. It's probably really hard. I think you need to relax. This one small thing you can do for her is to allow her to see the bears she wants to see. As tired as she is, all she does is sit and look out for them. Take a step back and allow yourself to see that is what is important here. Taking care of your children and bringing them joy when you can. I think you are likely in pain so I don't want to judge you. Just do better.", "Yta and u know it", "Yta and you made a huge mistake and you tried to mislead and lie to your child because you absolutely knew what you did was wrong.", "YTA.

Our 10 year old, Rose, has leukemia. A lot of the activities around the cabin are outdoors and Rose doesn't usually have the energy for that, so one of her favorite activities has been watching the wildlife from this big window seat in the master bedroom and taking pictures of what she sees. \n\nHer goal since she started doing this was to see a bear. There are some in the area but it's not too common to see one. She has me take her up to the window seat after dinner and usually falls asleep watching for bears. \n\nTowards the end of the 3 weeks, I had to take her to the hospital for chemo. 3.5 hours each way. That night she fell asleep in the window seat again and when I got up to carry her to bed, there were 2 bears close to our cabin. I called my wife over to see and I took a picture on Rose's iPad but my wife wanted to wake Rose up so she could see. She hadn't gotten to see a bear this trip. I told my wife she needs to rest and that showing her the picture would be enough but my wife still tried to wake her up. I stopped her again and got Rose in bed. The next morning I told Rose that there were bears last night and I showed her the picture. She asked if I woke her up. I said yes because I didn't want her to get upset but my wife told Rose that I wouldn't let anybody wake her up. We did not see any more bears for the rest of the trip and Rose has been devastated. She refuses to speak to me and deleted the pictures I took for her because apparently it doesn't count. She's even refusing to sleep next to me (she's been sleeping between me and my wife since she got sick) so my wife has had to sleep in Rose's room since the trip. My wife is even talking about taking Rose back to the cabin for a week to try to see a bear.\n\nI don't think it's a big deal but my wife and Rose are still upset with me so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then even come her saying you think it wasn't a big deal? Your sick child that has been sleeping with you needing the closeness refuses to do so anymore or really talk to you. This is obviously a big deal...and you shrug it off and need internet people to tell you you messed up? You best start working on how to fix this and what you can do to up her chances to see a bear.", "NTA.  Even if you had woken her up, there's a good chance she wouldn't have remembered it in the morning anyway.  Trust me on this.

And I wasn't sick, just sleepy.", "Even though it sucked that your daughter didn't see it. She needs rest. She just had chemo.", "Good fucking god, NAH. They're trying to do what they thought was best for the kid. I get people want to support children, but should worst case scenario happen, is THIS what they should remember?? Chronically online asshats on a subreddit??? Congrats for us readers, we had the context. The poster is someone worrying about their child's life. \n\nYes, you decided wrong. It was something she wanted. But it's not as if you denied the experience out of spite or pettiness. You're worried about her strength with everything she'll already be going through. I have a friend with leukemia that needs to be treated with arsenic, and she's incredibly lethargic and weak. I'd consider it, too. However, you and I both should understand that sometimes healing also requires what the soul wants, not just bodily needs. \n\nI wish the best for your family and I hope this isn't a lasting situation in any way beyond, \"remember when those bears were outside and dad was so worried about you, he let you sleep?\" \n\nFor the record, please don't lie to her about it again, nor deny the experience. But you're not an asshole for trying to put her needs first. This is such a hard thing and everyone had different wishes. Your wife wanted the memory of her seeing a bear, she wanted to see a bear, you were concerned with her physical rest and requirements. I'm so sorry.

As said, I absolutely get it. But I think you should apologise to her.", "Please tell me Rose slept in her bed with her mother.\nStop sleeping with ten year olds.

Do you somehow not understand that her illness is already bringing her constant and intense misery, and moments of joy are hard to find?\n\nShe really wished for something so absolutely minor as to see a bear, had her heart set on it\u2026 and you thought maybe half an hour of sleep was more important than her getting to *actually have* one of the things she wants without her illness fucking it up?\n\nIn long-term illness, there are a lot of \u201cworst bits\u201d. The symptoms are bad. Chemo is worse. The indignity. The pain. The constant stress.

Your child had a specific goal of seeing a bear, and you took it away from her.  She can look at pictures of bears any time, and they're probably  a lot better than the ones you took on the iPad.  Cancer is robbing her of many of the things she should be enjoying while she spends a year or two in chemo, but this is one really simple thing you could have given her.

So instead of going back to bed to rest happy that her goal was completed, she now has the thoughts swirling in her head that one of the people she loves and trusted actively kept her from making those nice memories.

Believe me when I say, if you haven't been a child who was told they would die that you literally have no idea what she's going through. Holding on to plans. Holding on to memories.

Sick kids still need to be kids and their lives need to be as normal as possible while they are sick. It\u2019s hard as a parent to allow that, but you must.
