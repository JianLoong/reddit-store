She films herself eating, twerking, and making the fat on her butt jiggle for the camera while saying how in love with her body she is.\nShe also says all the time that being fat is an honor and beautiful. This is important for later on.\n\nFor a public speaking assignment in class, she wrote about how modeling should be illegal because the models in fashion week are skinny and tall, and they look like freaks and not like normal girls. And they make everyone feel uncomfortable watching them. The whole assignment was about speaking calmly and effectively, but she was speaking very angrily and aggressively.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure her whole speech was just directed at me because it\u2019s known at school that I walk in fashion week, and she was weirdly staring me down during the speech.\n\nFor the audience counter argument part, the teacher then asked me what I thought of the arguments since I walk in fashion week. I said I thought it was all pretty ridiculous, of course.\n\nThe girl and her girls came up to me and my friends at lunch and said that I\u2019m eating fruit salad because of I have disordered eating, which I don\u2019t. She then said \u201cYou\u2019re only allowed to walk because you\u2019re tall and skinny, just so you know\u201d in a derogatory way. I said \u201cAnd you\u2019re not allowed to because you\u2019re short and fat. What\u2019s your point?\u201d\n\nShe yelled \u201cAnd the mask is off. I was just waiting for you to show your bigotry and insult me.\u201d\n\nHowever, if being fat is an honor and beautiful as she always says, I don\u2019t see how stating she\u2019s fat is an insult or bigoted. I would be pissed if someone called me fat, but that\u2019s because I don\u2019t see it as an honor, and she supposedly does.", "created_utc": 1667312868, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yja4yx/aita_for_saying_someone_is_short_and_fat/", "score": 8051, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
