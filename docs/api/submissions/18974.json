So I\u2019m currently at a friends house and I see $80 was taken from my account. I\u2019m not surprised at all because she constantly does this. She claims she doesn\u2019t keep money in her account because she doesn\u2019t \u201ctrust banks\u201d so that means when she needs to make an online payment 50/50 she uses my money. She doesn\u2019t ask. She doesn\u2019t tell me she uses it I have to text her \u201cdid you take money from my account\u201d. So fast forward to today. I was fed up and confronted her. She said she needed an Uber because she didn\u2019t want to drink and drive. I told her to grow up and be an adult, use her money and leave mine alone. Especially because she \u201cforgets\u201d to pay me back. She\u2019s going on about how she raised me and paid for me as a child.

Her reasoning for using your money seems valid (distrust with the banks), but she should pay you back if she's going to do that.", "NTA \n\nYour mom is taking advantage of you and using the \"I raised you\" card. \n\nIt's her responsibility to raise you. This means keeping a roof over your head, feeding you and keeping you safe, among other things. That's HER job! We parents don't charge our kids for all the expenses from infants to 18!!\n\nGo talk to someone at the bank about what's available for you to do. Also check with Credit Unions near you. Hopefully, there's a solution.", "NTA\n\nSee if you can open your own account.\n\nI had my own account at 14 when I was a kid. It was a savings account (didn\u2019t need checks at that age). \n\nI don\u2019t know what has changed so that kids need their parents on their accounts now?", "NTA. It is your mothers job to raise you and you do not owe her for that. It's cruel of her to use that as a reason to steal your hard-earned money. If I were you, I would contact my bank and explain the circumstances to see if there was a way to separate your accounts.", "NTA. I was sure I was going to say YTA until I read it. Your mom does need to grow up. I\u2019m sorry you are going through this.", "NTA and I\u2019d make it my personal business to utterly humiliate her by telling the people at your local bank exactly why you want her off your accounts.", "F that. I would start burying my money in a mason jar in the back yard, it would be safer than in your shared account. NTA", "NTA! It is wrong for her to take money from you like this, especially if she doesn\u2019t pay you back. Are you able to get an account with a relative that you trust more?", "immediately nta, she\u2019s literally stealing from you.", "I mean, she chose to have a child, a responsible at that. If she was really in need to pay rent, buy food I get it maybe you\u2019d feel like you had to help her but sounds like she\u2019s just doing it bc she can.

Make a list of all money she has taken and when.  You can also show this to the bank as proof of transactions not authorised by you.  Give her one chance to pay you back as it is theft that she has committed.  If no success just start calling her thief anytime you have to interact with her (it is the truth).  Will make it interesting for family gatherings but might finally hit into her that being a thief has consequences.", "NTA\n\nTell her congrats for doing the bare legal minimum expected of being a parent.  Does she want a cookie?", "Definitely NTA - No parent should be taking money from their child\u2019s account, especially if it is money you\u2019ve earned yourself. If she is \u201cforgetting to pay you back\u201d then she is flat out stealing from you. If i were you, i\u2019d be researching options on how to deny her access to your funds or switching to a bank that will allow you to have sole access.\nYour mother will definitely take the liberty if you allow her to, and who knows, she could eventually take money away from you when you need it most", "NTA... get her off of your account or keep it empty. Have a different place for your money. \n\nRegarding her raising you? That's what you do when you choose to have children.", "She raised you and paid for you because she had (and still does for another 2 years) a legal obligation to do so. NTA", "I Guess it was just what finally made me flip. She\u2019s very immature and acts like she\u2019s 20 lol so yes she is insufferable. If she asked before hand and paid me back I genuinely wouldn\u2019t mind, but she\u2019s just, her.", "Thank you I will look into it. We use the same bank and I have my \u201cown account\u201d but she has access to it and the money in a click. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just because of our bank or what.", "Taxes, what else?  They link children's income to the parents now.  In essence, children don't get an income per IRS...it gets included with the parents income on taxes now....until 18.  Then you have the whole college finance tax return requirements and parents can be linked to their children until age 26 due to health insurance entitlements.", "Yikes, sounds tough. If I were you, I'd start saving a chunk of my money outside, like maybe in a separate suitcase or somewhere she couldn't find it. Maybe not keeping all of it away (she could grow suspicious), but just leave out a good amount and save up in a separate place. But if you have the ability to create an independent account and withdraw money to that, then you should definitely do that, but that's most likely not the case.", "And please, OP, if she uses that \"I raised you\" BS, please ask her: \n\n(a) did I ask to be born? \n\n(b) did you expect me to pay for myself when I was a toddler? and \n\n(c) do you understand what legal parental obligations are, Mom? \n\nIn fact, because you are only 16, she is STILL obliged to pay for your upkeep and necessities of life.\n\nI would ask the bank manager if there is any way you can block access to your account, given the evident abuse by your Mom of the bank's requirement that she be on it.", "If you need to, go to a different bank or credit union. Choose somewhere close to home so you can walk to.\n\nOr talk with the one you are at, close that account, open a new one and don\u2019t share your banking details with your mom. Also instruct them to not share your banking details.", "Dang. Makes sense.\n\nI remember doing my own taxes back in the day. It was always easier back then.\n\nLooks like OP will have to withdraw their money and hide it to keep mom from using it.", "That\u2019s not at all true. In fact, you are specifically instructed *not* to put a dependent\u2019s earned income on your tax return. It does not matter what age you are.\n\nHealth insurance, FAFSA, and tax returns all fall under completely different laws and have different regulations and requirements.

No", "This \u261d\ud83c\udffb", "I was doing separate taxes in 1977 age 12, I started working early.... wanted my refund.", "I'm sorry you are right.  They include the interest and dividend income with the parents income tax return....not earned income.", "I hear credit unions are the place to go for an account of your own. \n\nYou are not going to see that money back, so stop putting money into it until you can have full control of your account.  \n\nOf course your mom paid for you. She chose to have a child. She signed up for 18(!) years of support. Many people support their children even longer.", "NTA.  Your mother is stealing your money.  Do you have to have an adult on your account?  If so, can you get anyone else to sign onto your account with you?\n\nBasically, you don't deserve to be treated this way.
