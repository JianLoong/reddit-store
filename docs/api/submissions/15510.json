June of 2022, I text Mike & say, \u201cHi we\u2019re only 3 months away from our wedding, just wanted to know if there was anything we needed right now to finalize\u201d. I didn\u2019t get a response & since I was away on a small vacation I honestly forgot to follow up. A few days later I texted him again,\u201d hey just following up here\u201d.

She basically said she didn\u2019t run the venue, doesn\u2019t know how to manage it, and she never wanted to learn and was not on the will to get this venue in the event that Mike died. Which means she needed to go to court and file for estate and then sell it before we can get our money back. This family was worth 51 million. Besides the venue, they owned 3 buildings in a very popular area of our town and they did real estate. She has been fighting me since last year claiming her lawyer said it can take years to get this case solved. I cannot wait years. $10,000 is a lot.
