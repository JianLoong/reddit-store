The family have no say. \n\nBut it will take years.", "I agree but the one thing I was worried about was not ever getting my money back. I have taken everyone\u2019s comments and opinions to heart and know what I should do. It was never my intention to be an asshole as I was thinking selfishly, but I just wanted to know other peoples thoughts is all.", ">The estate of Mr and Mrs doe ceases to exist once Mr doe dies.\n\nno... they don't take everything mrs doe owns away from her when mr doe dies... that would be absurd if all of her property ceased being hers because her husband died.... \n\nthat's asinine. \n\nit does not cease to exist so much as transfers to her in full.... \n\nlosing one of two owners doesn't mean something is free for grabs... it means the other owner owns it....", "the executor of the estate is the wife who still owns it...", "Since you did ask here first, you're not really an AH and since you've taken the advice, you're good.\n\nI get your concerns but unfortunately things work like this to stop every single person that her husband did business with going after her personally.\n\nSince you lodged a claim officially with a lawyer on the estate you should get you money back.\n\nNow if it turns out he has done dodgy bookkeeping and the business is bankrupt while the personal wealth is in her name not his then you would have valid moral grounds going asking her personally.\n\nBut since it seems she had nothing to do with the business she likely wouldn't even know herself if that was the case.", "really? are you sure? the legally appointed executor? what makes you say that? it's not in the post is it?", "nope I'm not sure in the slightest. that's originally why I asked about it but nobody else seems to have a fucking clue either and is just parroting the same shit while ignoring me pointing out that marital property is marital. \n\noh well."]}
