This decision might make me the asshole because my brother is relying on family support to pursue his dreams, and my refusal could be seen as not having faith in him or abandoning him in his time of need. Despite his past failures, he believes deeply in this new venture, and my denial of financial support could be viewed as not standing by my family, especially since I have the means to help. This has caused a rift, and his reaction, along with my parents\u2019 disappointment, makes me question if I\u2019m being overly cautious or selfish by prioritizing my financial security over his aspirations.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

An equity position in the new company, i.e. you will own stock in this entity.\n4. Any dividends taken out are paid to you first.\n5.

Additionally, the year-end CPA-prepared financial report AND corporate tax return is ALSO to be provided to you.\n7.
