This decision might make me the asshole because my brother is relying on family support to pursue his dreams, and my refusal could be seen as not having faith in him or abandoning him in his time of need. Despite his past failures, he believes deeply in this new venture, and my denial of financial support could be viewed as not standing by my family, especially since I have the means to help. This has caused a rift, and his reaction, along with my parents\u2019 disappointment, makes me question if I\u2019m being overly cautious or selfish by prioritizing my financial security over his aspirations.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You have your reasons for not lending the money. You\u2019re a good person for even feeling bad about not lending it to him.

Why should you GIVE AWAY your hard-earned money? \n\nYou tried to help him twice. It\u2019s his own fault he wasn\u2019t successful. I hate to say this but by gifting him this money it likely enabled him to not work as hard as if he used his own money or money from a bank loan. \n\nAbsolutely do not give him any more money. You\u2019ve been way more generous than most people would even think of being. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not your parents business. Tell them as such.", "Has your brother paid you back for the previous financial support?  Regardless, NTA.  If he is so convinced his new venture will work he should present his business plan to the bank and get a loan.   For family members weighing in, I would be asking them how much they are putting in and how many times are they willing to commit funding his ventures.", "NTA. I have been in your brother\u2019s shoes.. if the first two ideas failed, so will the third one. It\u2019s a tough pill to swallow, but I had to for my own good.

Besides, tell your brother that giving up on the concept of setting up businesses when you have no talent for it, doesn\u2019t mean you have to give up on your ambitions to better yourself and your situation. For me, 7 years of hard work and savings with my savvy wife, and we own 2 properties with more than 50% equity at this stage (sure, the covid induced realestate boom helped a bit on that front) Anyway, being strong in keeping your hard stance this time will only help your brother in the long run.

It\u2019s your money. You are under no obligation to give it to someone else.

Investments are risky, the last two didn't get repaid. So look at it in that light. Are you a person that generally invests in new businesses? How do you assess risk? What will the payback be if it goes well? If you don't like the answer to these Qs don't invest. Point bro to venture capitalists, and of course invite the rest of the family to invest their own money if they feel like it... It's usually a mistake to \"lend\" money to family, you can't get it back without causing a family rift....", "NTA. You have already tried to help.

Your brother needs to seek independent venture capital.\n\nI'll echo almost every other commenter and ask, has your brother paid back any of the money from the first two times?\n\nHeaven forbid you do give him money for Venture #3.  But if you do, get it in writing, prepared and reviewed by YOUR attorney, and include the following provisions:\n\n1. Written business plan to be provided to you immediately.\n2. Repayment of the sums from the first two investments before any dividends are paid, or salary paid to him or any other family members.\n3. An equity position in the new company, i.e. you will own stock in this entity.\n4. Any dividends taken out are paid to you first.\n5. If he takes a salary from the company, YOU are paid an equal salary.  This is SEPARATE from your investment money.  \n6. He is to deliver quarterly financial reports to you from the business.  Additionally, the year-end CPA-prepared financial report AND corporate tax return is ALSO to be provided to you.\n7. As soon as additional investment capital is obtained, it will be used to buy you out of your equity position at a 100% profit.  So if you put in $100,000, you are to be bought out for $200,000.\n\nFrankly, you shouldn't help him out again at all.  But if you do proceed, treat it as an arm's length investment candidate, and demand the same level of information and profit as if this was a stranger off the street.  Some of the points above are negotiable, of course, but these show that you are taking this very seriously and want it handled in a professional manner.

Dumb idea/economic conditions/brother inept? I would suggest if he paid you back then you are at zero loss, if you can afford it and have done due diligence then ask to be a shareholder.
