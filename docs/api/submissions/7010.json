My aunt is basically my second mom and watched me everyday when my parents worked from when I was a baby until I was old enough to stay home alone after school. I have four cousins on my moms side who don\u2019t go out of their way to see her, never call or see if she needs anything and only see her at family events. A couple of my cousins were always rude and had smart ass comments towards her all the time. Now my aunt has dementia. My mom and I take care of her bills, grocery shop for her, and take her where she needs to go. No one offers to help or do anything for her. She has been more then generous with them. Gave  them money when they need it, paid a bill when one of them moved out so it was one less expense they had. Gave her car to one of them for free. \nNo one appreciates anything. So after my aunt told me she left me her house my grandma( aunts sister) told my cousin she was pissed about it.  My cousin told me she gets why our grandma is pissed because it\u2019s not fair but also sees where my aunt is coming from. She said my grandma expected me to tell my aunt to split it between all of us cousins. I honestly don\u2019t feel bad and feel she did this for a reason. Also it\u2019s not up to me who does what with their will. I get it, but I also get why my aunt would do this and I have no plans to split the condo with anyone. I don\u2019t know why this is being talked about because the thought of my aunt not being here upsets me very much and is something I don\u2019t even think about. I also practically grew up at her house and would love to not even sell it. It\u2019s not about money for me but everyone sees it differently. So am I wrong for not feeling bad?\n\n\nEDIT\u2026. This has never been discussed between me and my cousins. The only cousin I have talked to about it was the one I mentioned in this post. Her and I are very close and she said she knows it\u2019s not in my control and understands why the decision was made.

It is what your aunt wants, and I can understand why she wants to do this. The problem is if she put this in writing after she was diagnosed with dementia I can see your cousins contesting arguing that she was not in sound mind and you used your influence as her care giver to make this happen. Clearly they\u2019re all about the money they\u2019d get splitting the sale of the condo and won\u2019t care that you have always had a closer relationship and helped care for her.

Some kind of, \"Can we cross that bridge when we come to it?\" comment can be repeated ad nauseum until they get the hint to stop asking.", "NTA, but I would highly suggest that you tell your mom and aunt to make sure that something is left to all everyone, enough that allows them not to contest the will (I\u2019m. Or sure what that is because its deep ant on area). You don\u2019t want them to try and make this harder so do what needs to be done to make sure the will can\u2019t be contested by anyone", "NTA, the property is your great aunt's to bequeath to whomever she chooses.

She actually went back and had it put in. RIGHT with the grandma comment. She has no room to talk because I told her that I would want a house like hers one day and said my oldest cousin has first dibs on it. I was like okay calm down I didn\u2019t mean it like that I said I liked your stay house", "No, but my mom is also on her accounts now so we can pay her bills. We had issues with scam calls also but we go there almost every day during the week to make sure everything is in order and that she is okay. She still knows how to shower, cook, keep up with some household things but is very forgetful, repetitive, doesn\u2019t like going anywhere etc. it\u2019s not at the point where she doesn\u2019t know who she or anyone is but it\u2019s getting worse. We don\u2019t want to put her in a nursing home but we will get her a aid when she needs one or I will quit my job and take care of her.", "I was told she actually went back and had that put in. It was about 8 years ago and she did not have dementia.", "Good! Your aunt doesn\u2019t want to leave her home to your cousins, and frankly they don\u2019t deserve it. You\u2019re helping your aunt because you love her, and you should get the condo because it has special memories to you.", "You seem to mean well and care.\nMaybe you can become her legal guardians? With her underlying illness, she will need it sooner or later anyway. And it would give you more security that everything will be done correctly in the future.\n\nNTA of course", "Thanks for the clarification. NTA.", "I\u2019ll have to talk to my mom about that. Is there actually a way anyone could go against her will? I don\u2019t think my family would do that or take it that far, I think it might just annoy some.", "A will is always open to challenge, especially if it is not notarised. And dementia is a slowly progressive disease. It is difficult to prove afterwards what the cognitive state of the person was and especially the free formation of will.\nIf someone else from the family becomes the legal guardian, everything could become more difficult with the house. Also, you are already accessing her bank account now, someone who wishes ill could interpret this negatively. If you have the legal guardianship, you are just on the safe side and as you described it, it would help your aunt not to get into a nursing home, for example.", "Interesting, I know it was done  with lawyers but that\u2019s about all I know. We will look into being a guardian. Thank you!", "Don't borrow future trouble. Enjoy her now, keep caring for her, and deal with the will after she's gone.\n\nTBH, you might have to sell the condo to fund care, so it could be a moot point. My Dad died of dementia and I was his caregiver, so I get it.", "NTA but... as your aunt has dementia this will potentially  throw up problems. Any will she made or makes after the diagnosis could be rendered invalid. So a pre-existing will will like take precedence. If you are named as the condo recipient then there is probably nothing to worry about. However, if you were named in a will made around the time of the diagnosis, this could be challenged by your 4 other cousins/ other relatives.", "NTA. Here\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s your great aunt\u2019s condo and also her decision. People make decisions like this for a reason. In this case it\u2019s clear that you treated her like a second mom including her in your life and helped her. None of your other relatives bothered. They\u2019re angry and greedy but don\u2019t deserve anything because they did nothing and couldn\u2019t be bothered with your great aunt. Word of caution: If your great aunt really has dimentia get documentation on this bequest. Your relatives sound like troublemakers and might contest this on those grounds.", "NTA. What happens if they find out is that they will need to deal with their actions and choices.", "NTA and don't you dare consider sharing it with any of them", "Too late if she's already been diagnosed with dementia. There's that \"being of sound mind\" part that would be contested if she changed it after the diagnosis.", "NTA. Follow your aunts wishes the woman had her reasons. Nothing to be scared of.

But, guess what, it is the way it is. Based on your sincere love for her and your sincerity in taking care of her, and the lack of that from other cousins, you DESERVE the condo.\n\nWhat your aunt chooses to do with her home after she is no longer here is nobody's business except for those that are included in her will and just for whatever the gift from her may be.\n\nBe prepared for hell raising once it is known your aunt did this for you, but ALSO be prepared to turn your back and get on with your life. Plan on keeping the noise makers at arms length, at best, until things get quieter.\n\nGood luck to you and be proud that you have been such a blessing to your aunt.", "NTA, they don't have a right to make decisions for your aunt's wallet. She was allowed to choose who she left it to. Stop discussing it with them because they don't get to say they don't respect your aunt's choice. She already made it", "NTA, it was left to you, so it is yours.", "They were rude and didn't really have anything to do with her? If they weren't a part of her life then why should they get anything? Sounds like she made a good decision leaving it to the only one who cared about her.", "NTA. You grandmother should butt out and respect her sisters decisions. Don't listen to her", "Nta. She probably is unable to change her will now anyway becausenof the dementia. Hopefully, you and your mom have all the legal stuff sorted out - medical proxy, power of attorney etc."]}
