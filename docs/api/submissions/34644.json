Because of this and other health issues, I have a pretty restricted diet, e.g.  dairy free. I also seldom eat processed foods but when I do they are small helpings. My husband (40m), \"Steve\", and I only buy certified gluten free and dairy free snacks, which we share. These are usually expensive compared to normal snacks and not always easily available (e.g., I buy them online so they take a while to arrive).\n\nBy his choice (which I definitely appreciate), Steve doesn't eat gluten at home so as not to worry about cross contamination. He either eats gluten outside the house or the GF snacks/food at home. He can buy a mini fridge for the garage if he wants gluten products at home, altho he is only willing to eat them outside, such as the backyard patio table. He finally bought the fridge a week ago even though he could have a long time ago.\n\nThe problem: For some reason, Steve kept finishing the GF snacks. There were a few incidences before I finally got very angry when Steve ate a whole box of crackers. Bare in mind, snacks for me are rare treats, so I was looking forward to having ONE cracker only to unexpectedly find none. After that incident, we agreed he should always leave me a serving or give me a heads up so we don't run out before we shop again. That didn't work, so then we agreed that if there is only one serving left he has to ask me first, since he usually eats the larger portion of the snacks anyway.\n\nThere were still other incidents, but the most recent egregious (prior to today), was when he finished a brand of ice cream I liked. What made things worse was there were two pints of this brand that I like and two pints of another brand he likes. Despite knowing that I never eat the brand he likes (because I don't like it), he chose to eat the brand I like and finished one pint. After the first pint, I just reminded him that he had to ask me before he finished the last serving of the second pint. He DID NOT. So again, I was left feeling upset when I went from excited about eating my ONE TABLESPOON of ice cream, to being mad and angry when there was nothing. What was left? HIS two pints of ice cream that he knew I didn't like.\n\nAfter THAT incident, the agreement was he won't touch the GF snacks unless he asks me first. Yet today, I go to find the leftover honeygrams I had kept in the fridge (again, because I only eat small servings), and lo and behold, there was nothing. He is at work, so I texted to confirm he ate them all, which he did. I told him to book himself for counseling because I can't take it anymore and don't know what how to fix this issue.\n\nI guess I want to know if it is fair to expect him to leave a bit of snacks for me? AITA for expecting this? AITA for making him go for counseling to resolve what I assume are underlying issues/anger against me?\n\nEdit: made changes bc I had to keep clarifying the same things.", "created_utc": 1704752198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191xt76/aita_my_husband_constantly_eats_my_snacks_despite/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was limited by characters in the original post.\n\n1. The GF snacks have ALWAYS been shared. Even now it is for all practical purposes shared. The requirement to ask me first before eating the last serving was born out of desperation to just be informed there was going to be nothing left so I would not expect a nice treat and find nothing after it happened numerous times. When that didn't work, it became asking me before he ate any GF snack. It is, and never was, meant to restrict his eating, just my desperate way to force him to notify me if he was going to finish the snacks so that I could buy more before we ran out. He has never been disallowed from eating the GF snacks, and actually eats the SIGNIFICANT proportion of it.\n2. We are not financially limited to buying more GF snacks. We both create the grocery lists together, so if he wants more, he can easily just add it to the list. The problem is, he doesn't. I've even bought more of things we both like without him realizing because he didn't add it to the list, but which I know he LOVES, and he still eats all of it without letting me know they will run out.

Bare in mind that since I don't eat much of my snacks in the first place due to my health limitations, whatever he eats is already more than what one person should be eating.\n\nYou're right that I may have to consider the fridge with a lock. I previously had a cupboard (unlocked) designated for my snacks, but he still ate them.", "I responded to another person's similar question, but basically he can buy his own gluten free snacks (or gluten snacks kept in the garage fridge) or before all this, even if he were to eat my snacks, he would just have to make sure to leave me a serving because I can't easily just pop out to the store to get the same snack since they can be difficult to buy in a normal grocery store. \n\nFor example, as mentioned in the incident with the ice cream, he did have his own brand of ice cream that he likes, yet chose to eat and finish my brand instead.", "Thank you fellow celiac! The struggle is real, not just with this issue, but celiac in general because of all the other accompanying issues that people don't think about, from intolerances to foods other than gluten, to other autoimmune issues that probably came from years of undiagnosed celiac, to the social aspect, to people who think gluten free is just a fad, etc. etc. Like sorry, but I would NOT do this to myself for fun.", "You're aware that Google is a thing, right?\n\nhttps://nationalceliac.org/celiac-disease-questions/airborne-gluten/\n\nhttps://answers.childrenshospital.org/gluten-exposure-risk/#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20gluten%20is%20a,food%20to%20avoid%20gluten%20contamination.\n\nAlso, I've got an uncle with celiac. He's ended up in the hospital from flare ups, they can be severe and celiac can have some serious symptoms and effects. Look it up sometime.", "He usually does the in store shopping on the way home from work. But prior to going, we have a grocery list, which we use google docs for. We both input whatever we want/need, so he can reference at the store. There are some brands that we have to go to further grocery stores to get (for example HEB, which is about an hour away), but we don't do those often, and usually those we go together because we typically couple it with other activities since it is a further drive, e.g. to walk at a new park.\n\nSome brands are \"hard to find\" because, frankly, a lot of gluten free food doesn't taste good, so often the good ones have to be found online. For those, I usually put in the order, but before I make any purchase, I always tell him to let me know what he wants to add. Or if I'm not going to make an order yet, it also goes on our reminder board (which we have on the fridge), so I don't forget to buy it for either of us. \n\nAbout the box of crackers, it wasn't really the first incident, but the first where I got really angry. There are only so much characters I am allowed for the post, but before this there were other incidences, such as having to eat my food faster before he ate all the food (e.g. fries we were sharing at a restaurant), so then I'd have to split them at the start or I'd barely eat any before they were all gone. So, there was already a sense of food insecurity I guess, that worsened after I was diagnosed with celiac.", "Sorry, I guess I could have written it better, but as someone living it, I am writing in the present so I wrote things as they are now. It was always BOTH our snacks. I was only forced to start calling it \"my\" snacks and require permission because he would eat everything and leave me nothing with no heads up. It was basically the best (albeit not great) solution I came up with to make sure something would be left for me or at least I would be notified of what was left so I could plan ahead to buy more before we ran out. Before you say, \"then don't make him ask for permission but just tell him to give you a head's up\", I already tried that. It didn't work. I saw a few people also suggest to buy more each shopping trip, but honestly, he would just eat all of it in one sitting anyway. I think the whole gluten/no gluten thing has made the issue more confusing, but the problem would exist even if the food was all gluten. He would just eat it all still.\n\nAs for eating outside, I edited the post to add that he is the one who wants it that way for his own peace of mind, which is, to be clear, something I appreciate. I just never thought it would be that hard to leave someone one serving of something or let them know in advance if you're going to finish something so they have time to buy more.", "He can buy as much snacks as he wants by including in on our shared weekly grocery list, both GF and non-GF. He's never been stopped from doing so. He just doesn't for some reason. Even when I buy more, he eats the extra. \n\nHe doesn't stand in the garage, he gets the food from the garage fridge, then goes to the backyard to sit at a table just for the gluten food. Also, as mentioned elsewhere, I'm fine if he wants to eat indoors, he chooses not to for peace of mind because then he'd have to make sure we don't use the same sponges for washing dishes, designated cupboard for gluten free food etc, etc. To him, it's easier to keep the house gluten free.", "She has offered the compromise of eating inside in a designated spot she can avoid he rejected that. HE insists the house be gluten free. She is not saying you cannot have snacks she just asks him to leave her a serving since it is literally the only thing she can eat. He had TWO of his own dairy ice creams and ate her two and did not even leave her a scoop and she cannot eat his.", "Okay, but to clarify, he is not limited to one cracker or one tablespoon of anything. If I only limited him to that then I agree I would totally be unreasonable. It is ME who is limited in how much I can eat because of my health issues. If he chose to eat the whole box of crackers but just leave me one, there would be no issue at all.\n\nI guess think of it a different way. We started with all the snacks being both ours. There was never \"my snacks\" or \"his snacks\". However, because he would eat all of the food without leaving me any, I always ended up with nothing to eat. Health issues aside, would you be okay with your significant other always eating all the snacks at home but not even giving you a head's up that you were running out before you could buy more?", "Seriously. And honestly, if the snacks really are for both of them, and husband has a bad day, why does he have to leave a bite of everything in their house? Why can\u2019t he chow down and eat a whole bag of crisps like we all sometimes do? If there are other snacks and they are shared, she cannot be mad. She needs to communicate about the ice cream thing. ESH", "Thanks for your thoughtful comment. That is definitely one thing I am considering when self reflecting on whether I should just let this go and be okay with this. Yes, we have a good marriage overall, but \"good\" doesn't mean perfect, as you said, so yes, there are other issues which we have had to work through together (and still are working through). And I have to decide if taken together with everything else, this is okay for me to just let go.", "That is actually not an option we have thought of before. I could do that but he doesn't want me to. He is the one who wants to keep the house strictly gluten free.   The \"sacrifice\" was never something I imposed on him. Why am I able to say that with such certainty? Well, he just came home and I showed him your comment and told him I would be willing to do that, and he said he doesn't want to because he is worried he will not clean up after himself well enough to avoid contamination.\n\nIt's also not really the same comparison. If I keep the gluten free snacks in the garage, I can only eat the gluten free snacks in the garage/outdoor patio (assuming we don't arrange anything to avoid contamination in the house). If he keeps the gluten food in the garage, he can eat BOTH the gluten food that is kept in the garage AND the gluten free food in the house. Just based on pro/con, it makes more sense for the gluten food to be in the garage. And again, I never forced him to, he is choosing to keep the house completely gluten free for his peace of mind, I guess because he is not great with attention to details so he thinks he will leave crumbs lying around and forget to clean them up, for example.", "I don\u2019t know why this is downvoted when it is the easy and simple solution. OP is putting all of the blame on the husband because he does the shopping but how hard is it to increase the quantity on the shopping list they both create?", "He does like Oreos! We've actually bought GF Oreos for him which I can't even eat because they contain oats (which I also can't eat). I hear from him (and others) though, that they taste exactly the same as the real thing.", "Not true. Read all the comments.", "I have binge eating disorder. Also throw in with a dash of OCD for needing to complete things.  Leaving one bit of food at the end of something is impossible.  \n\nMaybe his parents were like mine.  If you cleaned your plate you were a good child.  Bad children didn't get dessert.  Also food equals love.  \n\nCounseling and medication helped me.  I bet this has nothing to do with you.  It has everything to do with how he was raised and brain chemistry.", "I understand what you're saying. I really do. My mom is GF and we had a GF house my entire life. But you can't both restrict gluten (and trust me, eating outside is not the same as grabbing a normal snack in your own house) and say everything GF is just for you. It's simply not practical. If you can't afford for him to also eat GF then it's time for a tough conversation about how the household will work- and that might mean designated GF areas instead of designated gluten areas. When my parents were struggling monetarily we would buy duplicates that could be glutened, label things carefully, not bring them to the table, etc.", "Sorry, but I am not going to stand in a garage every time I want a snack just because you feel for some reason every snack is in the house is yours to dole out as you deem fit.  Is he an asshole for finishing them and not replacing them? Sure.  But the question here is not that. So Y.T.A., H.T.A., ESH", "I'd say YTA. He should either be able to eat his normal snacks inside or eat the gluten free snacks that are in the house. Making him eat in the garage is a huge imposition. In my opinion, if he's willing to never be able to eat most foods inside, you should be willing to share your crackers", "She\u2019s clarified that he chose to not have gluten in the house and she only asked that he ask her before finishing the limited things she can eat because he can always go get more snack foods if he\u2019s hungry much more easily than she can.", "Then don\u2019t eat the last of the snacks. Learn to share.  Or better yet, if you do eat the last of the snacks, add it to the damn grocery list.", "We share living expenses. I mean, I was totally down with him eating half. But eating all the ice cream and leaving me a tablespoon (after years of me SCREAMING at him) pisses me off. That's his idea of leaving me some.  So, I'll proudly hide the stuff now. He's lazy as fuck. I can hide a pint of ice cream in the back of the freezer and he'll never look. I now will happily eat all of everything and tell him too bad, so sad if he wants some.  No guilt.", "I think you should definitely get a refrigerator and cabinet with handles that you can put a bicycle lock through. He knows that this is a big problem for you and does it repeatedly anyway, so I can only assume he is getting a charge out of upsetting you for some reason. I would take that power away from him asap. You don\u2019t need the constant disrespect and anger in your life, and maybe if you take this weapon away it will motivate him to address what is driving his hostility in a more useful way.", "You\u2019re the one who needs a mini fridge and snack box just for your snacks.", "So you both do your own shopping? Only gluten free snacks in the house because of of cross contamination.  So all the snacks are for both of you?

Unless you both buy snacks and he is eating his and yours.", "Do you both do separate shopping trips?", "So all the snacks in the house are default yours? I'll be honest, the only legitimate complaint I see is the ice cream. Everything else are house snacks and should be usable by you both.", "Nope. Hands off my plate.

He's being inconsiderate... and I think he might have a problem with binge eating? It sounds like you could buy the biggest mega-bulk container available and he'd still finish it? Points to binge eating.... And he won't notify you before he finishes a snack? Also points to binge eating, and perhaps shame related to binge eating? \n\nI don't want to be \"one of those people\" who tries to diagnose a mental illness over the internet... but you've talked to him multiple times without anything changing, which makes me think there's more going on here... or else he's just an asshole, but it doesn't sound like he is in other areas.", ">but the problem would exist even if the food was all gluten.

If it\u2019s his choice, for safety (which I agree with btw) then you need enough gluten free snacks for you both. If he eats your portion it\u2019s about not prioritizing or considering your needs.  If you change your attitude a bit I think it\u2019d be more like he is the ah.  You just can\u2019t \u201cown\u201d everything gluten free if he is sacrificing at home not having gluten food.  Counseling sounds like a great idea to help you both communicate more clearly", "I understood what you said above.  You keep a (mostly) gluten-free home, at his request, presumably because he would find it too hard to keep the gluten-ish and gluten-free ingredients separate. He then eats all the food, leaving you none. He can easily get more food by going to any grocery store or corner store, but you need to make a special trip to get gluten-free food. Therefore, when he eats the last of the food, you go hungry. You have tried solving this by simply buying more gluten-free food, again, not because you require him to eat gluten-free but because he prefers that himself). But it doesn't help because he simply eats more and still eats the last of the food. You have offered that he be able to buy (and store inside the home) gluten-ish snacks so he isn't tempted to finish your gluten-free food, but he declines. \n\nTo me it sounds like this is either a problem of self-discipline on his part (he cannot or won't stop himself binging on snacks), or he doesn't respect you and is doing this on purpose. \n\nEither way, it really cannot continue. He is leaving you with no food because he refuses to share the food appropriately. He knows you have a restricted diet and eats the last of the only food you can eat.

That\u2019s starving your wife AND your child!", "Yes he has agreed! I had brought it up before as a solution, but he didn't want to spend the money on it so we didn't do anything. But after I texted him today about the honeygrams, I told him money for counseling didn't matter and he said he will go because he can't explain his actions either.", "But why are they \"extra\" snacks? Why are all the snacks at home OPs?", "It would be very important to mention that. I have an uncle with celiacs, I've seen how much he and my aunt spend on his food.", "Or why can't OP just buy more snacks knowing that her partner is going to eat them? Lol.  Seems like there are easier solutions that trying to be the controller of the snacks lol. I couldn't even imagine having to ask my partner if I could have a snack, nevermind have her actually tell me no lol", ".... As op said Husband could get himself gf snacks himself. But he gets himself snacks with Gluten and eats the gf stuff. \n\n\n\nThe ice cream is.best example. My brother did this too. He knew I don't touch most of the stuff he likes. So he intentionally eat what I liked first because he knew otherwise I would eat from it and his stuff was going no where. Basically if there were 6 of something (3 for him and 3 for me), I would get 0 to 1 and he 5 to 6 of it.", "Hmm, well I think generally it\u2019s an overall food issue irrespective of diet. It seems to be about a general willingness to fairly share from the available foodstuffs in the house. \n\nHave you considered baking? I tend to bake and of course that tends to allow me more control over distribution.  I can make larger batches, store some (air tight containers, freezing) and I kind of know what\u2019s around.  Looks of nice stuff can be made out of a variety of flours that are lower cost like corn flour.  I also get to choose what\u2019s being made!", "I appreciate that. Working on getting him into therapy. You're a sweet person.", "All the snacks in the house are gluten free because you can be harmed by cross-contamination. SOME of the snacks are dairy free because OP is also allergic to dairy. They had two kinds of ice cream in the house - one that is OP's favorite and is dairy free and a kind that is apparently Husband's favorite that OP can't/won't eat. Husband ate all of OP's ice cream and didn't touch his own. OP wants him to EITHER stop eating the things that are safe for her to eat OR buy enough of them so that they can both have them. The gluten-snacks in the garage are somewhat of a red herring as it's leading people to think Husband only gets garage snacks. He gets all the snacks and leaves none for OP.", "Because OP can *only* eat these specific kinds of snack that are difficult to find. Their husband can pop down to the store and buy some oreos if he wants.", "They\u2019re not all OP\u2019s. But as she can\u2019t have anything else and he can, it\u2019s pretty thoughtless to continually use up the foods she\u2019s limited to.", "I think OP has offered buying more snacks as an option, but husband would prefer not to, eat all the snacks and leave her none. Can you imagine eating all of a snack except one portion and being considerate enough to ask your partner who had none if they want the last serving? Can you imagine if your partner actually wanted that serving? Or would you eat it anyway, because how dare they want some and tell you no? Have you read the progression of the problem?", "Yes!!!   Hahaha!", "No, OP told hubby HE could buy more snacks.  OP can find a solution to this problem, but has chosen not to take the action and instead attempt to exert control.  Maybe hubby has a compulsive eating disorder?  Maybe hubby eats his feelings?  Maybe lots of things.  But the 1 thing we know for sure, is that OP did not take any actions to try to solve this problem for herself.  In fact in multiple places it states \"of we bought more, he would still eat it all\".\n\nThe feeling I get from the post, as well as the comments, is that OP is not being seen or heard, and it's not really about the snacks.  But for this to be the hill to die on seems crazy to me when it would just take adding more snacks to the shopping list, or going on and buying more yourself.  It really isn't that hard.  Annoying, but not hard.", "Why should the burden go on OP to fix her husband's F-ups? Why should she have to both compensate for and correct his inconsideration? \n\nWhy do you excuse the husband's AH behavior because OP could find a solution? If the husband F's up (and he has), it is on him to make things right. It's NOT on the wronged party to make themselves whole again. \n\nWhy do you think her buying a larger quantity of snacks would fix this? How do you know her husband would not continue to do the same thing and eat all of it? \n\nBy the way, it sounds like you also don't see or hear OP. She states that it's not as simple as zipping out and buying more. And furthermore, this is not about preferences or picky eating; consuming gluten could (and probably would) result in her going to the hospital. \n\nOP is NTA (but you most definitely are, Randy... are you her husband? You're oddly determined to place all the blame on OP...)", "Good point. Since he refuses to add snacks he likes to the shopping list she should clearly just guess what he might like. And then if there is something he likes (like ice cream), she should just accept that he's going to eat the ice cream she likes first and leave the ice cream he likes for himself for later because that's going to be a GREAT long term solution. Not hard at all. You even pointed out \"of we bought more, he would still eat it all\". So the real solution is to buy so much that he can't possibly eat it all? This is your \"not hard\" solution? Maybe the solution is that hubby could be considerate...but that's really too much to ask. You're right. Every spare penny should be spent stocking so many snacks he can't get through them all. How ridiculous to make a hill to die on \"I'd occasionally like to have a snack that we buy.\" She should just forego all snacks and leave them to hubby. SMH."]}
