I don't park in front of my house because there are too many stairs and I have bad knees. I park where I can access my side door which only has four steps for me to get in the house. This is usually in front of my neighbor's house however it is street parking. The house I park in front of is a young family with one small child. They have never told me that they had a problem with me parking there. But for the past week the young lady \"Rose\"  has been parking purposely so no car can get in front of her. It took about 3 days for me to nail their pattern.When her husband \"Tripp\" gets home he gets out of his car backs her car up to make space for his car and then gets back in his car to park. When I asked her about possibly not doing that since it's street parking to be fair to leave space for me to get in she told me \"leave me alone.\" I understand they want it to be easy to get their toddler in the house but I don't think it's right that she takes up so much parking. So this morning when I saw Tripp leaving I was going to talk to him about the situation with my knees to see if we can come to some type of solution. Before I could say anything Rose starts screaming out the window to not say another word about the parking. So I start arguing with her and I called her miserable. My neighbor next to me says I'm ah for bothering this family.

Have you had bad interactions with them before? More specifically Rose? She's either very defensive or just crazy.", "YTA you admitted to arguing and screaming at your neighbors. That's no way to get their cooperation. Also you just started parking in front of their house without talking to them about it. I realize it's  street parking but these are your neighbors and it would have been considerate to just talk to them and assuming that they wouldn't be annoyed with your \"I was here first\" attitude.", "YTA - you handled this wrong from the beginning.

Is your house on a corner?", "NTA.  You tried to amicably solve someone hogging public space and were greeted with unnecessary hostility.  Your neighbor has serious issues.", "INFO: Are your knees sufficiently bad enough to qualify you for a handicapped parking permit? And does your municipality allow you to apply for a handicapped space with easy access to your home?", "NTA.\n\nThey are reserving two spots with one car, which is an AH thing to do, everywhere and in all cases.\n\nThe rest of your story does not matter.  Street parking is street parking. They don't own those spots but neither do you. You don't get special treatment for having bad knees unless you have a handicap placard and there's a handicap spot.\n\nNOTE:  If you have an off-street spot in front of your house that you don't use, you could always offer it to these neighbors, but that doesn't guarantee you a spot on the street.", "So as I understand your description, Rose and Tripp have a car each, and there's space to park two cars outside their home. When Tripp is at work, Rose adjusts the position of her car to block both spaces. The motivation for this is to ensure that there's a space outside their home available for Tripp when he gets home.\n\nYou'd rather park outside their home, because it's closer to your side door than parking outside your own home would be. Parking actually by your side door is presumably too close to the corner to be a legal parking spot.\n\nESH\n\nRose and Tripp suck for their parking space blocking maneuver. You suck because you seem to think you own the space outside their home.", "If you have a handicapped placard, can you ask for a handicapped spot in front of their house?  NTA.", "NTA. Assuming street parking is public and not considered part of the home\u2019s legal property, they\u2019re the AH for trying to hog public property for their selfish reasons. You haven\u2019t insisted the spot is reserved for you, you\u2019ve tried to make a reasonable request. \nIn some places, what they\u2019re doing is a ticketable offense-a parking violation. You might reach out to city hall about potential solutions, such as creating a handicap parking spot due to the extenuating circumstances or suggesting resources for getting a ramp installed. I know ramps are only mildly better with lung issues, but it doesn\u2019t need to be steep.", "Unfortunately yes.

I qualify but I would have to have it on my street not the side of my house where I Park", "I live on an intersection. So the handicap spot would have to be on my street. My side door is on their street?", "I'm gonna go soft YTA. I understand this situation. But if it is street parking there is nothing that can be done about how many of you folks park. I suspect you already know as to why you tired to have a conversation with themI think they are already very defensive when I comes to you. They may see you as the \"messy neighbor\"", "Is there house across the street from where you are parking? I'm trying to visualize how parking at rhe side of your house on the corner is also in front of their house", "Why can't you get your handicap spot and walk to your side door?", "So it's an intersection. A street and B street. My front door is on A street. By my side door is on B street. Rose and Tripp live on B street.", "As long as your car door opens onto your property instead of theirs I see no problems with your parking choice. \n\nThey're being passive aggressive beyond belief if they won't even talk to you about it."]}
