T1D here and had a baby almost 7 months ago. I pride myself on being well controlled but postpartum blood sugar gets WILD. He shouldn't have been so rude about it, but sulking over it may be a bit much. Maybe in the future just keep a big water bottle next to your bed and all of your other supplies so you don't have to deal with him at all in the night. Your blood sugar will chill out in a few months, so hang in there.", "Esh\n\nHe's understandable for being tired and cranky but could have grabbed it and hopefully gone back to sleep.\n\nYou needed to take your insulin. Like someone said your insulin is important and most of a baby fussing isn't life threatening.", "ESH.  Your husband is an ass.   In a normal healthy marriage you help your partner when they are sick.\n\nYou have brittle diabetes, you're still drinking sugary sodas when your sugars and A1C aren't controlled and you 'forgot' to take your insulin?  Gurl.  Do you want to die?  Because this is how you die.\n\nDo you have a pump?  Because you need a pump especially if you're 'forgetting'.  And for the love of science, get ahold of your diet at least until you've got this situation under control.   Otherwise your baby is going to be left with a single father who is demonstrably an asshole.", "NAH your both exhausted and frustrated the first year is so exhausting.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have snapped, he is right about the fizzy if you have a condition you know you shouldn\u2019t but it\u2019s got to be so upsetting for you having to be careful all the time.\n\nTake water to bed with you at night but tell him that you were really feeling bad and don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help when needed", "This one is a tough one but I'm leaning more towards YTA simply because you already know your sugar is acting unpredictable and you're still drinking soda. Stick to water ONLY until things get under control. Your hubby is training to be a dr and he's giving you medical advice that your own dr would be telling you and you aren't following it. That is a bigger problem than who fetches water for who in the middle of the night. You can also keep multiple bottles of water by your bed... my diabetic husband does this.", "NTA. My wife is T1D too, and I understand how you feel.\n\n She had our baby 10 days ago, and I'll do whatever she needs. The sugar is uncontrolled right now too, so she has to take some sugar drink as well when she's low.\nI don't mind going to the kitchen at any hour to get whatever she needs (water or sugar)\n\nWhen you start feeling down, you are really tired to do some basic things any other people can easily do, like walking and getting water. Besides, the new baby also is the priority so you are focusing in him/her.\n\nI hope you get back on track with the sugar on blood, and try to talk to your husband explaining how difficult things can get for you. If he is going to be a doctor, he might now what hypoglycemia syntoms are", "Sounds like the genesis of this instance is that you forgot to take your meds and because of that you were uncomfortable, but not incapicated. Then you woke your husband out of a sleep to do something you could have done for yourself, but didn't want to. \n\nYou made your avoidable problem someone else's. YTA.", "While I don't think it is unreasonable to wake your spouse if you're sick, and might have wanted him to be aware that your blood sugar was high/low in case there was a medical emergency, it sounds like he is frustrated because you have a serious medical issue that you are not taking seriously. Yes, life is busy with a new baby, but if you're drinking sugar-filled soft drink and then waking him in the middle of the night to complain that your sugar is high - that's just you being irresponsible and selfish.\n\nSet alarms and reminders to take your medications. Life gets busy with kids - you need to get more disciplined with your diet and organised with your medications, rather than being careless and ending up in a diabetic coma or with organ damage, or worse.\nYTA", "Everyone saying Y/T/A and asking her if her legs work I don't think noticed that she said she felt sick. It's a natural part of a relationship (at least in mine) to ask your partner for a seemingly trivial request if you feel like hell. I don't want to make assumptions, but if she was lethargic and doubled over then walking could have been a genuine issue. NTA", "YTA.  You woke up your husband and asked him to get you water?  Wow.  Better start keeping water by the bed if you need water during the night.  Use one of those short squat cups with a lid, they are harder to knock over.\n\nYou aren't managing your diabetes by taking your medication properly.  You are also drinking soda which makes it worse.  You are a mom now.  Look into getting an insulin pump that beeps and gives insulin automatically when needed.", "NTA. As long as this isn\u2019t a common occurrence that you ask him to do things like this for you. But if you\u2019re sick\u2026 come on, he should show some sympathy.", "YTA - Type 1 here. Get on a smart pump to make these situations moot as the cgm will warn you if something is off well before these moments.", "NTA for the request but sulking is not a good look for an adult.\n\nBut \u2019m concerned about a doctor not taking this more seriously. T1 is not something to be messed with. Someone else mentioned keeping water by the bed and that\u2019s a good idea going forward but he could have gotten up. \n\nThe fizzy drink comment. Does he know the difference between type 1 and type 2? \nSure, it\u2019s not great for you but unless you had just had the drink, then what does that have to do with anything? \n\nMaintenance is all about balance but even that doesn\u2019t always work. Throw in labor, sleepless nights, if you\u2019re breastfeeding, etch \n\nDoctor of medicine? Really?", "NTA and as he is training to be a doctor he should know better", "ESH\n\nI think you can both reasonably be upset. I feel for you because you have a young baby you\u2019re caring for which is so hard but worth it, but I also can\u2019t imagine working full time, long shifts, and having an infant at home, then having your spouse need you in the middle of the night for something they could have prevented. \n\nYou\u2019re both in a difficult place, but you\u2019re both AH\u2019s for carrying it into the next day. Move on.\n\nSince you can only control you, try to take better care of yourself, have alarms, keep water with you, stop the fizzy drinks, etc. especially now with the added stress of caring for your child.\n\nYou mentioned in another comment that you forgot your insulin because you were handling the baby. Most things a baby will fuss over are not life-threatening. Diabetes is. It\u2019s okay to stop what you\u2019re doing with the baby and take your insulin when you need to.", "Nta. You wouldn't ask if you didn't need help and couldn't do it due to illness. Sadly if he won't help you'll just have to keep a bottle of water next to you in the future and anything else you might need.", "NTA\nWhat is up with him? You literally pushed a whole human out of you three months ago and are a diabetic. If he's making such a big deal about getting a damn glass of water, what would he do if, God forbid, the baby woke up in the middle of the night and he needed to take care of it or something like that? And even if he was angry, he should have gotten you that damn water and sulked later, when you are fine. What an a-hole, a future doctor...", "NTA, what kind of AH did you land? I mean that is just about as inconsiderate a thing as I've ever heard.", "NTA for waking him up, people think diabetes isn't that serious but it is. He was truly selfish and uncaring, he is right you need to take care of yourself but his reaction was uncalled for.", "Thank goodness we have someone so understanding and compassionate going into the medical field \ud83d\ude10\n\nNTA and I'm sorry he was treating you like that. Has he been taking care of baby as much as you? When he's not training is he doing the baby routine so you have time to rest and care for yourself?", "NTA.\n\nWhy did he even become a parent and husband? And why did you even choose this man as a husband?", "NTA. Someone training to be a doctor should be more understanding of chronic illness.", "NTA.  With how good he's taking care of you, he's going to make one crappy doctor.   he's a putz.", "YTA. You weren't incapable of getting out of bed for water -- which you also could be keeping by you in bed. Plus you forgot to take your insulin. Set an alarm or whatever. Plus you are still drinking sugary fizzy drinks??? The biggest no-no for diabetics.", "YTA. If he was already awake, I\u2019d see it a bit differently but waking him up to ask for water? It\u2019s your responsibility to manage your illness. Keep a bottle of water on the nightstand.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. \n\nDoctors have currently found that I have a tumour, and since last September I have been in horrible pain. Back, legs, lower abdomen, headaches, nausea. I\u2019m sick of tired of hearing myself complain about the pain, so I just suffer in silence. On more than one occasion my boyfriend has refused if I ask him to grab me something because I\u2019m in so much pain to move. But he thinks I\u2019m fine cause I haven\u2019t been complaining as much recently. It\u2019s hard not being able to do things for yourself and having a non supportive partner.", "YTA", "Info: why did you wake your husband to get you water?
