My MIL wanted us to move into her house after she\u2019s gone and take care of BIL, but still wanted to split the ownership of the house three ways. The house is supposedly rent-free, but we would have to take over maintenance costs, property taxes etc, which would be close to what we\u2019d pay to rent an apartment in the area.

To this day I don\u2019t understand why they think we would accept the responsibility of taking care of their son for possibly forever with no additional benefit whatsoever, nor why we\u2019d be okay with letting my SIL off the hook completely.

In my husband\u2019s culture it falls to the male, that means, even if he dies, the responsibility of caring for his parents or whomever it may be, falls to me as his wife, despite him having a fully functioning adult sister who is my exact age. This is currently happening to his Aunt, the wife of his only uncle (who is also deceased) despite the uncle having multiple multiple healthy living sisters. I feel your proposals were extremely fair\n\nETA: judgement. NTA", "If your parents leave everything to you,  you could turn around and set up a trust for your sister's care.  Don't let them stiff you.  Safe travels.  NTA", "NTA, advocate for yourself!\n\nUpdate us, it's definitely not over.", "NTA. If you were as greedy as they claimed, you never would have offered up options 1 & 4. But that\u2019s not what any of them are mad about and we all know it.", "NTA. At ALL.\n\nYour parents should plan their estate to establish a trust for the financial aspect of your sister's care after they're gone. It sucks if that means you and your brothers inherit nothing, but that may be how it has to be. Nobody's fault.\n\nYour parents can NOMINATE you as guardian, but you do not have to accept.\n\nYou and your sister are the only ones here who don't suck.\n\nKeep standing up for yourself!", "NTA\n\nINFO: why did your parents take the insurance policy out if it\u2019s not meant to go toward your sisters care?\n\nYou said they got those after realising she needs long term care.\n\nI don\u2019t get how they\u2019re so confused now. They expected you to be solely responsible WITHOUT any means to actually care for your sister? So they were explicitly asking that you suffer through that on your own?\n\nI honestly do not understand that. I imagine they over reacted in the moment, took it the wrong way, and now your brothers are reacting to your parents reactions. Hopefully they all calm down and see sense.\n\nWhat you\u2019re saying is simply leave their estate to your sister, whether through you, your brothers, all of you sharing the responsibility, a trust - these are options they should discuss with a lawyer. I\u2019d honestly think it maybe shouldn\u2019t have come from you, but rather just \u2018ok mom and dad, I can do it - how about you consult a lawyer to figure out how best to keep your resources to go towards sister so I\u2019m able to provide that for her consistently? Have you thought about a will and trust? It maybe useful to name all children there so she has more support, and we can swap out if life brings us our own struggles.\u2019\n\nGood luck! I truly hope it\u2019s a n a h misunderstanding. Otherwise I\u2019d be going LC quick, go ahead and move now under the guise you\u2019re using your time while they\u2019re still there for sis. And if they don\u2019t calm down and get their affairs in order, don\u2019t come back I guess", "NTA. I think your options given are very reasonable, and fair. Your parents realized in that moment that they can not hold their estate over your head because obviously you are not money hungry. Your brothers showed their true colors. Your parents really need to think this thing trough thoroughly, and ensure that your sisters care is settled before they pass. Stick with it!", "NTA. No one knows when your parents will die or what position you\u2019ll be in at that time. You might be living on the other side of the world with a dozen children, you may have caring responsibilities for someone else such as a disabled child, you might be in poor health yourself.  Their plan is ridiculous, don\u2019t go along with it.", "NTA I was a relative\u2019s caregiver for a decade and I think your terms are completely reasonable. Just because your female doesn\u2019t mean your family can unilaterally decide that you will have this sole responsibility without financial support. Good on you!", "NTA. This is some sexist bs that you have to be the carer. I\u2019m not sure nominating someone against their will works out quite the way they want it to. You can simply refuse the position. If anything, you\u2019ve been nice enough to let them know up front you are not the option.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA your post made it to TikTok and someone mentioned speaking with an attorney to make sure they don\u2019t try to undermine your decision or do something you haven\u2019t agreed to.", "NTA\n\n>They said that I'm trying to shirk my responsibility to my sister and that I'm greedy for trying to get everything.\n\nWhy have they decided that it's your \"responsibility\" over your brothers?", "NTA this is crazy, your suggestions were entirely reasonable.  Care for your sister isn't going to be cheap.  Your parents should be planning to leave this as a joint responsibility or via a trust.  Dumping it on a single sibling isn't fair.  Dumping it on a sibling that isn't the oldest is crazy, (the eldest having had the most opportunity to get established career/family).", "Sounds like the only reason you were born was to be your sister's keeper, while the male heir and spare get to continue the family line without being burdened by the needs, responsibilities or finances of their female siblings, regardless of intellectual capacity.\n\nNTA.\n\nJust because you're a woman, doesn't mean you need to be confined to the care role.  \n\nThey have a responsibility, not you.  When you're *voluntold* in the will, you know you don't actually need to take on the responsibility.  You can voluntarily forfeit.", "NTA - this sounds like they\u2019re all putting a guilt trip on you .. stand your ground with those 3 well thought out options", "NTA. It's fair to want something to back you up if you take sole responsibility. \n\nI hate that single people are seen as having nothing better to do with their lives and yet your established siblings are seen to have enough on their plates. Urgh! NTA NTA NTA. They have a responsibility to set their daughter up if she has disabilities. It isn't your responsibility.", "NTA. It's far too common this expectation of female children/relatives bearing the vast majority of care burdens, very often with little or no consideration of the financial burden that goes along with it. OPs brothers have been outed as selfish hypocrites. Her parents need to consider the inherent sexism in their expectation, and hopefully all come to an understanding.", "NTA \n\nCaring for people with non-functioning disabilities is an incredible burden to take on. Those outside of the burden view it as a blessing and whatnot because they aren't in that situation but it is still quite the burden. \n\nEstates and wills are ALWAYS a thing to fight over with siblings and parents when they are still alive. Even if it's completely worthless someone still wants to fight over it because they feel like they might get the short end of the stick. \n\nThat being said I wouldn't even offer if I were you and I didn't have a personal relationship with the disabled sibling. Even then it's still the parent's responsibility. Most of the time it's the youngest sibling that gets these types of crap deals and out of the cases I've known about, those siblings pretty much get stuck in solely caring for that person until they die. I've seen some that never married, never go out, never talk to friends, it's a much bigger burden than it seems. You're basically swearing off happiness or even the simple chance at happiness. That seems like a small trade off with an entire estate that's worthless to you because you'll never be able to use it or even enjoy it.", "Called their bluff! You are doing the right thing. Tying yourself down for life to your sister without full support of your parents' estate is asking to live paycheck to paycheck until your sister passes. If this is such an issue for your parents and your brothers don't want guardianship, then your sister will be turned over to the state and taken care of. Your parents need all of their resources to take care of her. Why would they expect you to do the same with less?", "NTA \n\nYour parents should not choose a guardian, if no one wants to take the role, she can become guardian of the state.\n\nBut best would be to leave everything to her in a trust and if she passes away the leftover will be split evenly between the three of you.\n\nBut again your parents can\u2019t force you to be her guardian", "Do you know the beneficiaries of their life insurance? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s your sister. This means your parents want you to assume caregiving for\u2026 one-third of a house.\n\nRegardless of what\u2019s written in the will, you can decline guardianship. I wouldn\u2019t continue to have this conversation with your parents. You\u2019ve stated your position, so it\u2019s on them to make choices for your sister with that information. NTA.", "Super duper NTA all of your suggestions are reasonable and fair.  Your parents are TA if they think you should take on 100% of the responsibility of care for only 1/3 or 1/4 of the compensation.  The brothers get off Scott free with their inheritance?  Ridiculous.", "NTA obviously but there's a lot of shit going on in the comments here. Getting everything to take care of her is not a solution either. You told yourself they're not really rich so it's not like it could provide for her all her life anyway (and who knows what you're gonna do with that money in the end. We don't know you).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real solution to that is your first idea and nothing else. The three kids need to take care of her.", "NTA. What you're offering is very fair. Your brother are AH for wanting inheritance but not the burden.", "Nope nope nope. You don\u2019t scapegoat a single child to become a lifelong caregiver unless that child has ASKED for that role. Your brothers are selfish jerks and your parents are being incredibly unfair. The only reason you don\u2019t have an established family like your brothers is because you\u2019re just starting your adult life. They think it\u2019s fair to prevent you from having what they have? To strap you with a caregiver burden that changes the course of your opportunities and future? Gtfo.\n\nYou are absolutely not an AH and I commend you for laying out all the options in a calm manner. Give them some time to think it over but don\u2019t budge.\n\nNTA", "ESH - instead of you telling your parents their choices with their money how about you sit down with them and plan together - working out how much care of your sister will cost or what support she will need! YTA because you can\u2019t sit and discuss things like an adult and involve your parents in discussions about their inheritance.  That should include being left 100% of their home I think so you have somewhere to live or can sell it to buy somewhere suitable. \n\nThey suck because they should have a financial plan in place for the care of their disabled daughter! Their should also be plans in place for what responsibility the brothers are going to take - at a minimum they should be doing 3 x 1 or 2 weeks of care each per year, if not more, so you get to spend time alone and not as a carer\n\nIn the meantime go travelling and live your life", "Yeah it\u2019s super telling that both brothers had nothing to say when OP basically called them on their crap. It\u2019s good that she\u2019s being rational and not letting her family members guilt her into getting their way.", "Absolutely agreed. Why is it the daughter is the only one who has to take of the guardianship?\n\nAlso, jumping in to add that just because OP's parents *intend* for OP to be her sister's guardian, doesn't mean she actually *has* to do it. Her parents will be dead when this happens, their feelings can't be hurt anymore, and they won't be around to try and emotionally blackmail OP anymore. It's as simple as refusing to be someone's guardian, the sister is not a possession that needs to be owned and OP does not have to accept anything to do with her care.", "NTA\n\nWhile a three way split of the responsibility/estate does seem the fairest. \n\nIf I were OP I\u2019d want the parents Will to have a clause saying all siblings had to continually take responsibility. \n\nSo her brothers just can\u2019t take the money & leave OP holding the proverbial bag.", "I really appreciate the thoughtful way you went about it. Your parents and brothers have options and can make a choice. For now their choice is to try to bully you into signing away your live - don't budge. Going for a three way with your brothers might turn out difficult, because they seem to want to give you all the responsibility and work, but with your ability to set boundaries you can establish clear rules even then. All the best!", "I think OP's suggestions were very practical and completely fair. His parents just want him to take all the responsibility and without a payoff. That's not how things work.\n\nNTA", "I think it's double sexism. The woman does the caretaking for the parents. The male children carry on the family name, and equal shares of the family estate, to their children. \n\nParents get well-supported grandchildren without disrupting care for their disabled daughter. All at the bargain price of OP's future.", "Makes me think of the book My Sisters Keeper, where they literally have a second daughter as a \"savior sister\" to give their ill daughter things she needs to survive (umbilical cord, marrow, eventually a kidney). So she petitions for medical emancipation. \n\nWhy isn't this a family issue where all kids are asked to help? Why do the sons get to be absolved from sacrifice? Its completely unfair.", "Misogyny \u2728", "I'm sorry OP but to me it looks like your parents only saw you as your sister's back-up plan. The fact that your brothers also support you getting 100% guardianship means that they were also probably in the loop or also consider you as such. That or your family is misogynistic and only sees you, the youngest daughter as the one who has to take care of the others.\n\nIt is not your responsibility to take care of your sister. I would personally cut them off whenever financially possible. Having 100% of the estate so that you can at least have a place to take care of her is what I would have expected the bare minimum.", "I don\u2019t know your brother\u2019s ages but it almost sounds like your parents had you for the sole purpose of taking on the care of your sister. If your brothers are older than her it\u2019s a strong possibility and if they\u2019re younger than her it\u2019s like they wanted a girl with the maternal instinct to take on the responsibility and stopped at you. \nPlease continue to stand up for yourself. My mom (and dad) have done 85% of the care for my grandmother and she is one of 5 kids. These situations sucks.", "If they and your brothers agree to the three-day split, make sure you get in writing the split of responsibilities.", "Honestly? Just tell them to take you out of their will so you don't have to do 100% of the caretaking (which will fall to you). Tell them to take you out and you won't take any responsibility for your sister. Tell them that if they leave you in the will that you will simply divide your portion between your brothers so they can care for your sister. If you don't do this, the whole lot will fall to you. It's good that she is in a care home, and I don't know where you are from, but if for some reason the care home falls through or you need to become even more involved in her care for whatever reason, well, that could ruin your life and your future. As you have said, your brothers are established. You can tell your parents that you are willing to have another conversation 5 or 10 years down the road (I mean, I wouldn't, but that's just me), if you are looking for ways to soften the blow. NTA at all.", "At this point I would engage a lawyer to find out if there is any way to protect yourself from having guardianship forced upon you", "Absolutely. I think OP can see this for what it is. She\u2019s only 23 years ahead of her and they want her to become nursemaid with no backup for her own life. Her family is extremely selfish.", "OP's parents can name anyone they want as guardian, but it not legally binding.  You cannot force someone to do something from the grave.  If OP's parents name her guardian yet fail to provide the necessary resources, she can simply say no and walk away.", ">Absolutely agreed. Why is it the daughter is the only one who has to take of the guardianship?\n\nBecause that's likely why they decided to have her in the first place. Don't want the older brothers dying before the disabled sister because then she'd have no-one to look after her. Have a younger child though and the odds are they'll live longer than the sister.\n\nGod I'm such a cynic.", "That too what if ops sister doesn\u2019t even want to be taken cared of by her younger sister or any relative for that matter it don\u2019t seem like anyone asked for her say but nonetheless op is NTA and is imo doing everything she can to make things better", "Which they absolutely will.", "Yep, that's what I was thinking. A three-way split just means that the brothers are going to ignore their responsibilities. Honestly, putting all the money in a trust for the sister seems like the best and fairest way to make sure she's looked after.", "That pissed me off. Its about planning the future before one or both parents croak. This isn't \"springing\". This is literally preparation.", "Some neighbors have 2 children:\n\n- a severely disabled 40 year old son\n\n- a healthy 36 year old daughter\n\nThey had the second child just so she would take care of her brother. Obviously, it didn't work out and as soon as she went to college she built her own life and barely keeps in touch with her parents.", "My thoughts were that as they are older and boys they are not caretakers and they hadn\u2019t been raised with this idea - OP says she was told all her life this will be her responsibility. Equally maybe the brothers were not receptive so they had another child to groom into being a caretaker \n\nIt\u2019s very sad and messed up - but ultimately none of the siblings are responsible. I thought option 2 was the best - OP and their brothers are all able to pursue careers and support themselves so the parents assets should go towards their child who cannot advocate for herself or be independent", "Yes this is the thing. You didn't \"spring\" anything on them, you offered them several totally reasonable choices!

When someone is named trustee or executor, or given a power of attorney, they can decline to act in that capacity, even if there is no named alternate.  The responsibility devolves to the appropriate governmental authority at that point (at least in North America, and I would expect in the UK and Europe, too; beyond that, I\u2019m not familiar enough with the legal systems, although I assume that they\u2019re largely similar in all the various Eastern European and African democracies; come to think of it, I\u2019m a little surprised I\u2019ve never thought about whether they follow common law, the civil code, or something else altogether, and now I\u2019m going to go fall down a Google rabbit hole, sigh).   \n\n\n\nTL; DR: it\u2019s unlikely OP can be forced to be her sister\u2019s guardian.", "It sounds exactly what's happening but she's giving her parents the benefit of knowing how it's all going to go down before they pass so they can make the necessary adjustments.

That said, it certainly shouldn\u2019t be up to one sibling to be responsible for this unless they have chosen this!
