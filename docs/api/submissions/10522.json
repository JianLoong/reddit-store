My MIL wanted us to move into her house after she\u2019s gone and take care of BIL, but still wanted to split the ownership of the house three ways. The house is supposedly rent-free, but we would have to take over maintenance costs, property taxes etc, which would be close to what we\u2019d pay to rent an apartment in the area. Their reasoning is we didn\u2019t have kids yet and sister does, so we\u2019d be more suited to take over BIL\u2019s care. \n\nTo be fair, neither pushed us to accept, but wtf? To this day I don\u2019t understand why they think we would accept the responsibility of taking care of their son for possibly forever with no additional benefit whatsoever, nor why we\u2019d be okay with letting my SIL off the hook completely.

The fact your brothers aren't stepping up speaks volumes on the values of your parents and what they taught their sons.\n\nAll 3 suggestions are absolutely fair. Have they looked at the world lately? They are setting you up to fail if they leave you nothing and responsible for her. Just because you have a job now that affords you to work from anywhere doesn't mean you will have it forever.

I've seen some that never married, never go out, never talk to friends, it's a much bigger burden than it seems. You're basically swearing off happiness or even the simple chance at happiness.

And your two brothers calling you out on that but having nothing to say when you offer them to take the a better deal (full estate + full sister responsibility) than the one they want you to take (third of estate + full sister responsibility) also tells us everything we need to know.

The first time I ever actually heard of it was in a science class just because of all that. Probably why the book and movie endings are so different too. The twists in both though were just so good. I'm just gonna go on a rant because I really like it. If you don't want to be spoiled for either one, don't keep reading this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, spoiler people all gone? Good.\n\nSo for both the Book and the Movie there is a big twist near the end. But it's a very realistic one. So the story goes the original child is dying of cancer, she's had it since she was about 3-5. So the parents are desperately looking for someone who has the bone marrow type they need to save their kid when a doctor suggests using IVF to create a designer baby. Obviously, that is ethically fucked. You can't create a person to save someone else. But their desperate so obviously they have the kid. Anyway, years later when that baby is 12 the one with cancer (who is now a teen) needs a kidney transplant. So the 12 year old sues her parents for the right to make her own medical decisions.  \n\n\nAlso their mother is lawyer who retired after the kid got cancer, so she's defending herself in this.  \n\n\nIt's full of a lot of guilt tripping on the mothers part that makes you really hate her, but you have to remember she has spent the last 13 years dedicating her full life to this kid with cancer and if she fails here that kid will die. So it's very emtional for her.  \n\n\nBut anyway, the big twist is revealed in court. I can't remember if it's any different in the book but in the movies it's revealed by their older brother (oh yeah he's there, he's not very relevant mostly). In the middle of court he tells everyone that the reason the younger sister is sueing isn't actually because she doesn't want to give the kidney, but because the one with cancer is done trying to fight. The younger one really loves her sister, but she can't stand to see her in pain anymore and goes along with the plan to sue their parents for her. It just makes all the guilt tripping hurt so much more when this 12 year old girl doesn't actually care for the kidney, she just wants her sister to finally rest.   \n\n\nNow, what happens next depends on the book or movie. Both end with the case won by the 12 year old. But the book then has her get in a car accident on the way to the hospital and die in the crash, her kidney is then put into her sister and the book ends with the one who had cancer talking about how much years later she still misses her sister, even now she's finally healthy. Obviously, very weird ending if you came into the book expecting realism. So the movie ends with the girl with cancer dying and the family finally being able to move on and live normally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth endings are so sad to me, but the whiplash I had after reading the book when prior the movie was the exact same threw me so badly off.", "It's worse: it sounds like they only had OP to be the caretaker.", "Agree, it is a really unfair situation, luckily, it seems OP has a good head on her shoulders, and is thinking this the right way.", "But don't you see that they prepared OP her entire life for this responsibility so she should have told them in the womb already. /s", "\u201cSpringing it on them\u201d just shows how entitled they think they are to OP\u2019s life, her labor, her money, her commitment, it\u2019s really just an expectation that she will do it that\u2019s not a question or a choice for her.", "Plus, they are the ones that brought it up!", "I dont understand your parents.\n\noption 2, where sister gets everything in a trust for her care is probably the best option. just have all three siblings check on the sister to make sure everything is OK.\n\nNTA", "Prefer?

Their own unforeseen financial needs might leave the estate bankrupt or be sneaky and gift the bulk of their assets a sufficient amount of time before they die to disqualify it from being considered inheritance, and upon their death you then refuse to inherit because there\u2019s no reward for taking on guardianship. So they have died without provision for her care.\n\nAlso, what one of your siblings agrees to the slice of cake with both the responsibility and the money, but then can\u2019t follow through a few years on?

My mom's second youngest sister was unmarried and without a family so the family decided she would do it.  \n\nMy aunt was 25. She was young and exploring life. She was so pretty and kind. She had a number of suitors interested in an arranged marriage with her,  which is something optional with my mom's family. Most marry for love though, and that's what my aunt wanted.\n\nWhen my grandmother passed 25 years later, my aunt was 50. She didn't get a chance to have a family, that was taken from her by her family. She no longer had suitors lined up, and ended up getting married out of desperation rather than love. Her personality was stunted from not having much human interaction - just spending all day with my grandmother, watching her sisters live their lives. She was good natured at first but the burden eventually took its toll and she became withdrawn and resentful, rightfully so imo. \n\nShe had 6 siblings. The ones with children would visit but they were too busy taking care of their own kids to help. She had one brother who lived at home but men are not expected to help so he did not. Not one finger. No one offered her a night off, or financial help.  My immediate family lives in another country across an ocean, my mom prioritized a better life for her kids. \n\nSo the moral of the story is: \n\n1. Do not put your life on hold. You can support your sister by visiting her in her facility. \n\n2. Do not depend on your brothers at all. They are not going to help you.  \n\n3. Do not let your family guilt you into giving up your chance at a life. \n\n\nI look back... if I had been asked to live my aunts life when I was 25, I would have never met my husband,  changed careers to something I love, been able to spontaneously travel, buy a house. I'm not even half way through her 25 year role as caretaker. \n\nAt the end of the day,  you're NTA but I'm just saying - even if you were - fight for the life you want to live. You deserve that chance. Make option 2 the only option.", "NTA. It\u2019s really fucked up that you\u2019ve spent your entire life being told you\u2019re going to have to be someone else\u2019s guardian without it even being a choice for you. Also, figures that you as the only other daughter is expected to do this but your brothers aren\u2019t and won\u2019t step in despite you telling them they can at any time if they feel so strongly about it. Super easy for them to talk shit when they aren\u2019t expected to take that responsibility on for the rest of their lives, especially since they got to go out, live their lives, get married, and have kids. You\u2019re barely out of university age! Completely ridiculous and unfair to call you greedy for wanting to live your own life. I really, *really* hate when parents have another kid and expect them to put their entire life aside to care for another child of theirs. If you have kids, you signed up to be a guardian for life. You signed up to make those sacrifices. You don\u2019t get to tell your kids they have to do the same and be happy about it though.

Screw that.\n\nYou\u2019re well within your rights to avoid being taken advantage of, and your alternatives were totally reasonable.", "NTA, you gave reasonable options that were anything but greedy. And moreover this sounds like a case where standing up for yourself is being conflated with being too selfish.", "NTA. I have a similar situation with my 32 year old brother. My parents are trying to find a fair way to make sure he\u2019s taken care of. They\u2019re basically splitting all the money but one of us gets my brothers portion to help care for him. He cannot actually have any significant amount of money (I think his limit is a couple thousand), and I\u2019m guessing your sister can\u2019t because the government who pays for her care will take it all.  It\u2019s unfair for your brothers to leave all the care on you and just split everything else. It is NOT your responsibility to take care of your sister when they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re choosing you because you don\u2019t have a family of your own yet. Either way, the answer is no. And they can\u2019t guilt you on this. Your parents are in a tough spot as they literally CANNOT live forever and they want to make sure she\u2019s taken care of.

Nevermind the complete asinine nature of assuming she will always be available and has no further plans of her own in her life.\n\nOP, do not let your family browbeat into a decision that will affect the rest of your life.

From a young age (idk like 12 or something) I have felt that this should be me and my sister, but my parents have always insisted that there be a solid plan that allows for my brothers to be cared for by non-family members because they never wanted it to be an obligation on my sister or me. As it stands we're both adults now and remain 100% convinced it's a choice we will make, and our parents are less concerned about having alternative plans, but they still have them.\n\nAlso a few years ago I suggested to my mum that she leave me out of her will in favour of the money protecting my brothers and she told me that's nonsense.

It would be one thing if she were 40 and had actively agreed to the arrangement her entire adult life. Even then imo she would be entitled to change her mind, but I could understand her family feeling blindsided if it was like \"you were fine with this for the last 20 years of adulthood, what changed?\"\n\nBut she's a young adult who is just starting to get to the age where she can really understand what she wants her life to be and the implications of what her family has been trying to force on her since she was a kid.

It\u2019s absolutely gross. NTA, OP! Stand your ground!!", "Yes, how else could she do this without \"springing this on them\"?  Are they supposed to understand her point of view by osmosis?

Which she did, calmly and reasonably.", "Knew a family growing up where the parents had been given custody of their young granddaughter who had some kind of mild intellectual disability/was on the spectrum. They decided to go for a do-over and adopted 2 daughters about her age so she'd have siblings/friends. They pushed them into the same activities and social circles and handed down rules about including her and all that. It didn't work.\n\nShe was included because people liked the other two and people were polite because they knew it was the other two who would get in trouble if they weren't. But obviously she was seen as a stupid spoiled whiny brat who just wanted to get the other two in trouble, and there's nothing anyone likes more than an excuse to be mean to someone while also feeling morally superior because she deserves it for treating her sisters like that and getting them in trouble and it's fair because the parents always favor her so you're just evening up the scales. But of course this would lead to jealousy on her part and more spoiling by the parents and more resentment from the other two and so on and so forth.\n\nPeople, even adults, would find ways of subtly favoring the other two.

We have decided that it will be best to place her in facility care. We love her, but it can be difficult emotionally.\n\nProfessional care shouldn't be considered a \"dereliction\" or a \"last resort.\" I mean, I'm also not for for profit care centres and believe the \"warehousing of humans\" (eg schools, prisons, senior or other long term care facilities) should never be for profit. Ideally, these places can provide things people are lacking; in the case of your aunt, specialized care and treatment. And enrichment.", "You should encourage them to start transitioning her into  some kind of care now. Not even necessarily a facility. Depending on where you live, there could be really good community living programs, where they live in a smaller house or apt with a roommate, (maybe a few depending.) with staff on hand. She could slowly transition to living there, then your parents, and other family could visit her. And if wanted, bring her around for holidays, etc.", "Your parents have done well by you.

I'm an only child and even *I* have had more conversations with my parents about their will than they seem to have had (when I was still a minor but old enough to have some input it was letting me know who the first and second choices for guardians were and what kind of trust structure there was. When I was 21 it was them letting me know they had changed it so I would get everything, no trust, and some serious conversations about how that was because they thought I was mature enough not to blow it all). \n\nAnd that was for literally the simplest situation possible -- only child, no one else I needed to be concerned about.

They're not planning on helping at all and the OP should be very careful with what she signs up on, because they WILL take advantage the moment she drops her guard.", "Not really.

You might want to edit your comment because its super misleading.\n\nI agree though. I know a family who had a very hard time conceiving because the woman was older and they did IVF and had a daughter with Downs Syndrome. They were desperate to have another child to take care of their older daughter when they were gone so they actually had another baby with an egg donor and the husband's sperm. They openly admit that's why they had the second child. Older daughter is a toddler and younger daughter is a baby currently, and they already expect this to be the arrangement.", "Sadly it happens.
