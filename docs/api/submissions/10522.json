My MIL wanted us to move into her house after she\u2019s gone and take care of BIL, but still wanted to split the ownership of the house three ways. The house is supposedly rent-free, but we would have to take over maintenance costs, property taxes etc, which would be close to what we\u2019d pay to rent an apartment in the area.

To this day I don\u2019t understand why they think we would accept the responsibility of taking care of their son for possibly forever with no additional benefit whatsoever, nor why we\u2019d be okay with letting my SIL off the hook completely.

I've seen some that never married, never go out, never talk to friends, it's a much bigger burden than it seems. You're basically swearing off happiness or even the simple chance at happiness.

You've either been the least favorite kid your whole life, or there's some underlying sexism (cuz women are inherently caring and nurturing, right?). And your two brothers calling you out on that but having nothing to say when you offer them to take the a better deal (full estate + full sister responsibility) than the one they want you to take (third of estate + full sister responsibility) also tells us everything we need to know. They also wouldn't want to take care of your sister, and they're mad cuz your refusing will mean they'll have to step up.", "Careful with this.

Now all you can do is set a very clear boundary that you will not be your sister's long term care plan, and refuse to discuss it further.

Be there for your sister in whatever capacity you feel comfortable, live your life, and set your boundaries. That's all you can control.

However it may be impossible to make either brother actually do their part. She may end up being the sole guardian regardless.

It's like splitting a cake. One person slices but the other person gets the first choice. I would prefer the slice with no money and no responsibility.", "The sister lives in a group home. She would not be caring for her.

She tripled up on your suggestion.", "Except she doesnt hate her the sister is just asking for extra support since she will be the sole caregiver which is reasonable and if they don't want to give it she doesn't have to take on the responsibility and it's on the parents for not keeping in mind \"this is my child and my responsibility to ensure they are cared for even in death\" and their only game plan was to give that responsibility to their daughter only instead of split three way.", "How does OP suck? She set clear boundaries but also loves her sister and was trying to make this work for everyone. That's just being a good person. If they choose to reject those alternative solutions, that's on them completely.", "Hey friend when you agree with OP you need to put \"NTA\". \"ESH\" means everyone sucks here.", "Yeah that book was great at raising ethical questions in relation to the whole \"savior siblings\" thing. The first time I ever actually heard of it was in a science class just because of all that. Probably why the book and movie endings are so different too. The twists in both though were just so good. I'm just gonna go on a rant because I really like it. If you don't want to be spoiled for either one, don't keep reading this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, spoiler people all gone? Good.\n\nSo for both the Book and the Movie there is a big twist near the end. But it's a very realistic one. So the story goes the original child is dying of cancer, she's had it since she was about 3-5. So the parents are desperately looking for someone who has the bone marrow type they need to save their kid when a doctor suggests using IVF to create a designer baby. Obviously, that is ethically fucked. You can't create a person to save someone else. But their desperate so obviously they have the kid. Anyway, years later when that baby is 12 the one with cancer (who is now a teen) needs a kidney transplant. So the 12 year old sues her parents for the right to make her own medical decisions.  \n\n\nAlso their mother is lawyer who retired after the kid got cancer, so she's defending herself in this.  \n\n\nIt's full of a lot of guilt tripping on the mothers part that makes you really hate her, but you have to remember she has spent the last 13 years dedicating her full life to this kid with cancer and if she fails here that kid will die. So it's very emtional for her.  \n\n\nBut anyway, the big twist is revealed in court. I can't remember if it's any different in the book but in the movies it's revealed by their older brother (oh yeah he's there, he's not very relevant mostly). In the middle of court he tells everyone that the reason the younger sister is sueing isn't actually because she doesn't want to give the kidney, but because the one with cancer is done trying to fight. The younger one really loves her sister, but she can't stand to see her in pain anymore and goes along with the plan to sue their parents for her. It just makes all the guilt tripping hurt so much more when this 12 year old girl doesn't actually care for the kidney, she just wants her sister to finally rest.   \n\n\nNow, what happens next depends on the book or movie. Both end with the case won by the 12 year old. But the book then has her get in a car accident on the way to the hospital and die in the crash, her kidney is then put into her sister and the book ends with the one who had cancer talking about how much years later she still misses her sister, even now she's finally healthy. Obviously, very weird ending if you came into the book expecting realism. So the movie ends with the girl with cancer dying and the family finally being able to move on and live normally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth endings are so sad to me, but the whiplash I had after reading the book when prior the movie was the exact same threw me so badly off.", "It's worse: it sounds like they only had OP to be the caretaker.", "Agree, it is a really unfair situation, luckily, it seems OP has a good head on her shoulders, and is thinking this the right way.", "But don't you see that they prepared OP her entire life for this responsibility so she should have told them in the womb already. /s", "\u201cSpringing it on them\u201d just shows how entitled they think they are to OP\u2019s life, her labor, her money, her commitment, it\u2019s really just an expectation that she will do it that\u2019s not a question or a choice for her.", "Plus, they are the ones that brought it up!", "I dont understand your parents.\n\noption 2, where sister gets everything in a trust for her care is probably the best option. just have all three siblings check on the sister to make sure everything is OK.\n\nNTA", "Prefer? Just don't do it. It's not your responsibility. Tell them no. You don't have to negotiate with any of them. \n\nThis will ruin your relationship with your parents and brothers either way.

I suspect these relationships aren't that great to begin with.", "NTA\n\nYou have provided fair and compassionate choices and communicated very clearly.\n\nMy only advice is to not engage, debate etc...

You can only will assets, not liabilities.\n\nIt might not even be legal to tie their assets to the responsibility to care for her, per your cake slice analogy. You might agree to take the responsibility slice if their estate is worth half a million but they can\u2019t guarantee that, no matter the value at the time of making the will. Their own unforeseen financial needs might leave the estate bankrupt or be sneaky and gift the bulk of their assets a sufficient amount of time before they die to disqualify it from being considered inheritance, and upon their death you then refuse to inherit because there\u2019s no reward for taking on guardianship. So they have died without provision for her care.\n\nAlso, what one of your siblings agrees to the slice of cake with both the responsibility and the money, but then can\u2019t follow through a few years on? The inheritance is spent and the responsibility is foisted off? \n\nYour parents are setting up your sister for abandonment and worse if they think they can just force her guardianship onto you or one of your siblings without your/their agreement.

You did good. \n\nLet me tell you a story that haunts me. When I was 9, my grandmother had a stroke that left her completely paralyzed. She required a full time carer. My mom's second youngest sister was unmarried and without a family so the family decided she would do it.  \n\nMy aunt was 25. She was young and exploring life. She was so pretty and kind. She had a number of suitors interested in an arranged marriage with her,  which is something optional with my mom's family. Most marry for love though, and that's what my aunt wanted.\n\nWhen my grandmother passed 25 years later, my aunt was 50. She didn't get a chance to have a family, that was taken from her by her family. She no longer had suitors lined up, and ended up getting married out of desperation rather than love. Her personality was stunted from not having much human interaction - just spending all day with my grandmother, watching her sisters live their lives. She was good natured at first but the burden eventually took its toll and she became withdrawn and resentful, rightfully so imo. \n\nShe had 6 siblings. The ones with children would visit but they were too busy taking care of their own kids to help. She had one brother who lived at home but men are not expected to help so he did not. Not one finger. No one offered her a night off, or financial help.  My immediate family lives in another country across an ocean, my mom prioritized a better life for her kids. \n\nSo the moral of the story is: \n\n1. Do not put your life on hold. You can support your sister by visiting her in her facility. \n\n2. Do not depend on your brothers at all. They are not going to help you.  \n\n3. Do not let your family guilt you into giving up your chance at a life. \n\n\nI look back... if I had been asked to live my aunts life when I was 25, I would have never met my husband,  changed careers to something I love, been able to spontaneously travel, buy a house. I'm not even half way through her 25 year role as caretaker. \n\nAt the end of the day,  you're NTA but I'm just saying - even if you were - fight for the life you want to live.
