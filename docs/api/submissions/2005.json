They are her enablers so you should limit contact with them", "Because you claim she's incestuous and trying to creep on her much older BIL who has wife and a young kid. It's a disgusting accusation.", "This right here. Your parents framing you as a villain for talking about it because she doesn't like it says that you should establish distance with them.

You and your husband have expressly told her this is something we're not comfortable with please stop and she continues to do so.\n\nHim just being there at a family outing isn't consenting for her to keep taking pictures.
