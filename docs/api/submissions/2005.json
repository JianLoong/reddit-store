Especially your family member.", "INFO: How old is your sister? Is she close to the same age as you?\nI have to wonder if she's weirdly competitive and you being married and having a child (sounds like she is unwed and child free) is making her jealous and she's coveting them", "NTA. Sounds like she was being weird. Maybe she just wasn't thinking, but maybe she was doing a whole lot thinking. Made him uncomfortable too. Sure, it's usually best to pull somone aside, but sometimes a good shock is what they need. Doubt she'll do anything like this again.", "is it just of your husband/son or is she taking pictures of others as well?", "Nta, your sister needs to learn what personal space is. Your parents are failing here too as they don't understand personal space", "INFO, how old is your sister", "I vote weird. Tell her to simply not do it.", "NTA.  Sounds like your sister has a thing for your husband.  You need to keep an eye on this and continue to make sure she understands that what she is doing is inappropriate.\n\nYou don't want to imagine the alternative.  There was a post a while ago where someone's sister was pretending online she was the baby's mother, had a page regarding it.", "NTA, unless there was something weird going on there is not reason for her to get upset when you asked her to stop taking pictures of your husband even in front of others. Like 70% of the pictures should not be of your husband. That is just odd behavior.", "NTA. It is odd and we start to wonder if she was fantasizing about being in your place or something.", "NTA. When it gets to the level that a guy notices, it's usually over the top.", "YTA. Your parents were right. This sounds like it was the first instance of you saying something, if it was a repeated request I would understand saying something in front of an audience. But even though you think it\u2019s weird, she is your sister not some random creep with a camera. You should have given her an opportunity to explain herself/apologize without others present. \n\nUnless you have other suspicions about your sister\u2019s feelings toward your husband, it sounds like best case she is probably just a typical 19yo who loves taking pictures and worst case it\u2019s a (probs harmless) crush she didn\u2019t realize was obvious.", "Is your sister a teenager, and does she have a crush on your husband?", "NTA all around weird", "NTA for asking her to stop.

Why didn\u2019t you talk to her in private about it? You didn\u2019t even know for sure she was doing it with bad intentions, you kind of just acted on a hunch. Regardless, should\u2019ve been a private conversation.", "ESH. She should not be taking pictures of your husband after being asked to stop and you could have spoken to her privately about it.", "ESH\n\nYou definitely should have pulled her to the side and had a private conversation, HOWEVER your husband has also mentioned on how many she\u2019s taking. If it\u2019s making him uncomfortable then she should have stopped when asked.", "I can understand that you feel weird about it, but maybe your delivery is what makes you TA? Why couldn\u2019t you talk to her separately?", "This one\u2019s tough. I\u2019m not entirely sold on if OP\u2019s sister was in the wrong at all.

This could have been solved in private with a conversation.", "NAH- with caveats. I can understand being weirded out by someone taking excessive pictures of your family, but I can also see from her perspective being an excited aunt trying to capture family memories. Question: Would it be as weird if it was his sister? I can also see that having that conversation differently might have been more tactful, pulling her to the side, asking why she is taking so many pictures, and then explaining that it makes you uncomfortable and that you would like her to stop.  By saying it infront of others it probably really embarrassed her when she was potentially trying to be supportive. So in my opinion NAH...just huge miscommunication", "ESH (except for your son).\n\nSounds like you got jealous so you tried to embarrass your sister in front of everyone. You could've easily took her aside...but if your husband had a problem with it then why didn't he just say he didn't want any photos?", "YTA. You have every right to feel what you feel and think what you think but you could of told your sis in private. The sister does come off weird  but how you handled the situation was just wrong.  You basically shouted out to everyone your sister was a creep, of course she's going to get defensive, you embarrassed her. If you pulled her aside said stop you don't find this appropriate and she continued then you called her out your actions would of been somewhat justified.", "YTA for doing that in front of everyone. You SHOULD have taken her aside if it bothered yall and mentioned it was making you uncomfortable and please take less of him.
