He's only working here temporarily, as he had an epiphany and decided to try to start his own business with the help of my dad funding most of it. He only really comes around when he needs something and to put it bluntly, he's a total kiss ass to my dad. I'm talking \"yes sir, no sir\" when he talks to him. He needs a job? Runs to my dad. He needs money for rent? Runs to my dad. He needs a car? Runs to my dad. He also LOVES to start drama at his big age, and used to create problems between my parents back when they were still together.\n\nWhen he does come around, him and I have a pretty okay relationship. Sure, I don't agree with some of his choices but it really isn't my business. He's a non-commitment type of guy and is always talking about/seeing a new girl. He tends to tell me his girl drama to get my advice a lot. So I started telling him about a guy I was dating which was a BIG mistake later on.\n\nAbout 4-5 months of me talking to my now current bf, we wanted to plan a trip to go away together. My uncle and I were having a casual convo about planning vacations one day, and I told him that I think i'm going away soon with the guy i'm dating. He was all on board with this and even told me that I shouldn't have to share with my parents that i'm going away with the guy i'm dating to my parents because i'm \"grown\", were his words. \n\nSo I had given my dad a heads up that I was planning on going away with a friend. He was on board with this. A few days later my uncle pulled me aside at work and told me that I need to tell my dad the truth of who i'm going away with, or he will. He claims my dad and step mom were talking about how much i've grown that i'm going away by myself now, and were happy for me. My uncle said he felt guilty knowing that I was going away with a boy, and they didn't. He also said \"i'm not sure if you booked the trip or not yet, but if dad makes you cancel it hopefully you can get a refund or dad will give you the money back\". \n\nI was SO upset and basically called him a kiss ass because I knew he was forcing me to tell my dad because he didn't want it to come back around to him later on. \n\nI ended up telling my dad and he was upset with the fact that I lied to him (we've made up since). I told my uncle that he's a snitch and that I am NEVER telling him anything again. He said i'm overacting and being an AH to him.\n\nI am refusing to speak to him, other than being civil at work, and have my grandparents on my dad sad calling me crying to apologize to my uncle because they are old and don't want to hear that we are fighting. My mom is on my side and feels that I shouldn't apologize, and my dad agrees that I shouldn't trust him again but thinks I should apologize for what I said.", "created_utc": 1673030805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1051zoi/aita_for_telling_my_uncle_hes_a_snitch_and_im/", "score": 196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are an adult and told your uncle something in confidence. He then used your confidence to blackmail you into doing something you didn't want to do. He cannot be trusted ever again, and he's the one that owes an apology. You owe him nothing.", "NTA.  BUT...You know he likes to stir the pot, so stop giving him the spoon.", "NTA You are an adult so you can vacation with whomever you want. You can also not confide in your uncle anymore. I will say, when your going away, have someone designated who knows who your with, where you're going and when to expect you back. It's a safety thing in this day and age.", "Nta\n\nA grown ass uncle shouldn't be asking his niece for dating advice. \n\nDon't apologize and never tell him anything. Not jack. You were justified telling him off.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve learned a valuable lesson about your uncle. You knew he liked to start drama between your parents and now you know he likes to start drama with you. Apologize if you feel like it but put him on a strict information diet. If he wants advice about his girlfriends fine, but he doesn\u2019t need to know anything about your relationships.", "NTA. Why is your grandma crying for this? Tell everyone you will not apologize.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep the uncle at a distance .. he is an AH, and you can not trust him.", "NTA Your uncle is a jerk. Don't share any personal info with him again. You're a full grown adult. You do not need his permission or your father's to go on a trip with anyone.", "NAH but he didn\u2019t snitch on you. He rather you be mad at him then his brother be mad at him for not sharing information, which would have happened if dad found out that uncle knew-regardless of how old you are.", "ESH. You probably should have told your dad what you were doing. Your uncle was asking you to be honest which is fair and did talk to you first before talking to your dad which was good. However in this case I don't think it was his place to tell your dad unless he legitimately thought you were in danger from going away with this guy. Calling him a snitch is a bit of a petty insult. Hard to know if he was looking out for you or just a jerk.He sounds a bit immature from your side of things.", "yeah, unless there's stuff op is not telling us (like the bf is fifty years old and they've only been dating for two weeks) op is an adult and doesnt need her parents permission or approval to do what she wants", "ESH. The uncle for obvious reasons but I don't think OP is sharing the whole story either.", "The Uncle also needs to grow up.", "Agreed. I'm going to be very vague from now on.

Also we've been dating for around 4-5 months now.", "\n\n Even if OP's parents know they are dating sometimes people (even later in life) get worried over what their parents approve of. I might be wrong, but OP Said they are 20 so it seems like a relatively normal reaction imo.\n\nIn the end OP is an adult and can go on a trip with who they want, but it's not an uncommon reaction with young adults.", "sweet. you're an adult and dont need your parents, or uncle's, permission or approval to do what you want", "The parents didn't even actually care. They were just upset about a lie, which is like reasonable", "NTA. You got backstabbed. Totally reasonable to never turn your back to them same person again.

That is kind of weird after 5 months not telling anyone about him.", "Here is the apology you should give your uncle:\n\"I am sorry that you are a snitch and that I can't trust you anymore. I am even more sorry that I ever trusted you in the first place. And now, sorry, but could you please leave me alone and stop whining about what happened to your mommy and daddy and try to behave like the adult you supposedly are?\"\nYou are NTA, by the way.", "NAH. I can understand why your uncle wasn\u2019t comfortable with keeping a lie from your dad when it sounds like your dad is supporting him quite a lot. He is allowed to change his mind on how he feels about something, maybe he was fine at first and became uncomfortable later on after mulling it over. He gave you an opportunity to be honest with your parents about it, I don\u2019t see why that\u2019s asshole behaviour. By the sounds of it, your parents don\u2019t actually even care it\u2019s with someone you\u2019re seeing, rather that you lied about it. Why did you feel the need to lie in the first place?", "NTA.  When your uncle shows you he's a snake believe him.", "NTA, you have nothing to apologize for, your uncle is a mooch who saw keeping that secret for you as a risk for him being able to run to your dad for money whenever he needs it. Your uncle just doubled down to say that he is a grown man who is always going to seek financial assistance from your father, and places that as his utmost priority before having a relationship with you.\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for, but I do think you need to look at this situation and see that it takes two to tango. Your uncle is only able to run to your father for money, because your father likes that dynamic and keeps participating in it. Of course your father is going to tell you that you need to apologize to your uncle, because he is the man taking care of your uncle. Don't take your dad's opinion on this subject", "Nta don't apologize", "Why not be honest with parents from the start if you feel that you aren't doing anything wrong?

Nta op", "Seriously, like I get that these are all these people whining for him are his enablers so it makes sense, but it is just ridiculous how they don't have enough awareness to look at what they're doing and see that they are trying to bully a young adult to apologize to an older adult for being angry that this older adult violated their privacy", "I appologise  my telling  the truth  of your actions and attitude  offended  you. Say this."]}
