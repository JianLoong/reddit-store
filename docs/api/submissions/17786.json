Most perfumes here have a very strong scent and people can smell them from far away.\n\nI'm not a fan of these type of perfumes and i always wore light scented. That is until my mum's bestfriend gifted me a tester of an arab perfume and i honestly liked it. That was 3 years ago and i've been using it since then. \n\nFew weeks ago i arrived to philippine for a vacation and have been enjoying here and i'm still using the perfume and my cousins liked it. \n\nSo i didn't see any issues until today when i was in a store with my mum looking around stuff. And then a woman walk up to me and said my weird perfume attacks her poor nose and what kind of perfume is that. I didn't say anything because i was embarrassed and i didn't know what to say. My mum told her off and the woman left pissed.\n\nNow i feel bad because people have different noses and i know most people are sensitive when it comes to strong scents and some people can't even breath being around someone who wears too much perfume.\n\nAnd if you're confuse about how much do i spray perfume: 8 sprays before going out (2 sprays on each side of the neck/shoulders/waist, 2 sprays on both arms, i hope it's understandable to read). I don't re-spray throughout the day because it can last a day and half. (Except if there's an occasion or smth special and if i do, i don't spray as much as before).\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit (052123):\n\nHello everyone. I understand now that i'm in the wrong here. \n\nI want to say that i WASN'T aware that 8 sprays is bad and i thought that's what all people do and thought that it's normal. Most people i've encountered (especially in college) BATH in their perfume everyday (Probably more than 8 sprays). The class room would be filled with mixed perfumes from here and there (and some re-sprays alot too) and i get annoyed about it and i considered mine as less than how much they sprays. Well i didn't know i'm one of them too. \n\nNow i'm not saying all people in middle east are doing this too no no. But majority or just every people i've encountered. My friend had finished her bottle like 2 months which is extremely extra for me. Mine can last for almost a year. (I sometimes don't wear one)\n\nMy mum or anyone around me didn't correct me for wearing too much perfume so i thought nothing is wrong. Oh how i wish someone spoke up to me sooner so that i would realize that this is wrong. And it did happen yesterday.\n\nI was surprised about how the sprays should be 1 or 2 sprays but oh well. The more you know. So i see this as a lesson to me.\n\nI didn't all the comments but i had read alot of the comments and i'm very thankful that you guys have been nice to me. I was having a second thought of not posting because i kept thinking someone might send me a death threats or something, or insulting my entire existence. But i'm glad i posted so that i know that i'm in the wrong.\n\nI should've known that 8 sprays is too much. I know some would say \"This one is dumb, who doesn't know how much perfume they should spray\" and i'm very sorry.\n\nI thank everyone here for being nice and educated me and i also would like to thank the lady at the store for telling me but i might not see her again and if i do i would thank her and apologize to her.\n\nAnd i'm sorry for everyone and for people who are sensitive or allergic to perfumes. Believe me when i tell you i wasn't thinking properly. \n\nFew people had sent me a message asking for the name of the perfume. So for those who is also curious of what the perfume is: \n[Gissah Imperial Valley Perfume](https://imgur.com/gallery/0QvEwE1)\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful day & night. \ud83d\udc9c", "created_utc": 1684621486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nb18k/aita_for_wearing_a_strong_perfume/", "score": 985, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It can vary from minutes to hours up to a day or two.\n\n\nAlso depending on the concentration (eau de cologne, eau de toilette, eau de parfume, parfume, elixir), the temperature and your skin chemistry, the sillage and projection can vary greatly.\n\nIt is advised to use small doses of \"strong\" perfumes, or practically anything that isn't a cologne (that in most cases will last less than 30 min). In this case 1 or even 2 sprays will be enough.\n\nAs to where, maybe neck and chest if working with the hands daily; or just the arms if presenting yourself with extended arms. \n\nYou have mentioned using 8 sprays of an already \"strong\" parfume.

No. Then why do you go up to people and tell them you hate how they smell when you can walk away?

A bunch of other girls do the same thing. It\u2019s normal.\n\nYou\u2019re also in public. People are going to get a variety of smells in public places. Just recently, my nose was attacked by a bunch of musty smelly people in a Walmart store that had me in a rush to get my stuff and leave.

But I didn\u2019t go around telling people their smell offended me. \n\nI\u2019ve also been around girls who wore strong perfumes that were nasty to me.

I\u2019ve heard only good things about perfumes from the Middle East due to the strong scents. \n\nBut as good as they may smell, it can be too much for some than others.

I don't know a single person that wears perfume regularly.  I know a couple who might on  a night on the town \n\nTo me, perfume is very 1986. People just don't wear it anymore. Almost every workplace is posted scent free. Purposely putting chemicals on your skin for no reason is not something most people do, since we're constantly taking in chemicals over which we have no control.

I wear oils so it\u2019s only like one drop behind each ear and on the wrists and even then, it can be quite strong if it heats up a lot with body heat. \n\nArab perfumes just recently went viral on tiktok too (Hareem al Sultan Gold specifically due to someone describing it as \u201ca goddess eating fresh fruit\u201d) and they\u2019re OILS so they\u2019re super concentrated. Even if it wasn\u2019t an oil, 8 sprays is WAY too much for many perfumes, even when like body sprays from Bath & Body Works were all the rage in the 90\u2019s and everyone smelled like clouds of cucumber melon & sweet pea. Those were quite dilute but packed a punch and if OP is spraying it on before she puts clothes on, no doubt the scent gets stronger with body heat too", "Holddd up adding this in case someone reads and freaks out.

There\u2019s a reason they dab or spray in subtle pulse points to show closeness, allure, consent to get closer, seduction, sexual hinting and aren\u2019t traditionally sprayed liberally on say your forehead. Perfume is personal not for all people who cross paths with you.
