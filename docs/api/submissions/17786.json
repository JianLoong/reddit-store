That lady was very rude, but you should really tailor your fragrance to the setting.

But again that\u2019s entirely your preference! \n\nAt the end of the day, keep wearing the perfume you like, with however many sprays you like to put on - but A LOT of perfume or cologne can be too much in a closed space at times and it sounds like you\u2019re wearing a huge amount. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been doing it that way for 3 years though and she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s said anything I imagine she\u2019s just a one off annoyance that you shouldn\u2019t worry about!", "NTA if people don't like how you smell they can stay away from you. simple as that \ud83d\udc4d", "NEVER apologize for wearing a fragrance you enjoy, NTA.

A spray or two would be fine, but any more than that is too much. It\u2019s not even about people just not liking the scent, but medical conditions.

That amount of perfume is frankly repulsive. I wouldn't be able to be within five feet of you without getting physically ill. Many, *many* people have physical sensitivities to scent or strong noses.\n\nOne spray distributed between both wrists and one spray on the back of the neck is plenty, especially if your perfume is strong.

You are definitely wearing too much, so try dialling it back to one spray. I won\u2019t call you an AH because I was 19 once and wore too much makeup. It\u2019s easy to go overboard when you like something. Just remember that with scents, a little is lovely, none is fine, and too much will leave a bad impression.", "NAH. So this is a cultural difference. I live in North America but have also lived in the Middle East and I know exactly what kind of Arab perfume you are talking about and how people use it.\n\nIt's normal to basically take a bath in perfume in the Middle East, but here if anyone can smell you when you walk by then you have too much on. \n\nThe reason here it's considered rude to wear so much perfume (and yes, what you described you spray on yourself is A LOT to us) is because some people have allergies or sensitivities to perfumes. Also, it's old fashioned, but my Grandma used to tell me too much perfume made you seem \"cheap\". I don't hold to this outdated sexist idea, but it gives you some background on how North Americans think of lots of perfume. \n\nI was told growing up you should dab (or spray) perfume behind your ears, on your wrists and your neck pulse points, maybe behind your knees and that's it. The only people who should know you have it on should be people who are embracing you, or at most within one meter of you. If it can be smelled more than a meter away it's too much. \n\nNow, this is the norm for North America. When you're home, you do you.

That is completely OK.\n\nBut, presumably, you're not in the ME anymore, and if you're in a \"Western\" (Australian/European/American) country... this is most certainly NOT ok for more than one reason:\n\n1- Health considerations. People with certain respiratory and other chronic conditions cannot breathe or function as a result of the presence of strong scents. As a chronic migraine sufferer, I'm in existential pain thinking of the strength of 8 sprays of perfume. \n2- No stranger should be subject to hear intimate details,  see private things, or SMELL you from across a room. Have some decency. All five of my senses are meant to spark joy, not for assaulting.\n\nSorry, YTA.", "Are you using it instead of deodorant?", "Me too, I always thought I was alone in this! I get a headache before I even smell it. Like I enter an elevator, get an instant headache, get confused, and 2 seconds later I reeeeaaally smell it and understand what happend. \n\nYTA OP, a strong smell in public isn't okay", "Me too!  It\u2019s rude to cause others pain in the form of migraines because you are drenched in perfume.  YTA", "Thank you! I just posted I get them, too. I get horrible migraines walking through a department store with perfume counters.", "I was fully on board with an N T A ruling until OP said it was 8 sprays\n\n8 sprays of ANY scent is too much, even the most benign of perfumes. OP, YTA and need to tone it down to max 3 sprays (and even that is probably too much for your admittedly strong scent)", "I'm gagging just thinking about it.", "Also, people can be allergic to perfume or have sensory issues.  \nI fell into both categories until my food allergies were sorted (weird immune thing; my body assigned everything as the enemy while I was trying to figure them out) and I sought treatment for my processing disorder. Strong scents were suffocating, infuriating, and made it hard to breathe.  \nPerfume is supposed to be a pleasant surprise. It's not meant to announce your presence.", "I have one strong perfume and my one spray is strong and lasts the whole day. My only other perfume which I much prefer the smell of doesn\u2019t last nearly as long but the max amount of sprays I can do is four.

Do you prefer cat food or dog food?", "I wear one spray. I cannot imagine eight. That\u2019s chemical warfare.", "Mine too.

And fuck those Downy Unstoppables and other products designed to make your shit smell for a month. \n\nI just had my lease renewal inspection at my place last week and the woman\u2019s fabric softener lingered in my home for almost an hour- WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN. \n\nMy eyes start to itch, my nose starts running like a hose, I get the worst headache, sometimes asthma attacks, and even a rash if it\u2019s bad enough. \n\nI hate all of that shit, including everything Bath and Body Works sells.
