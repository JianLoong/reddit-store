But again that\u2019s entirely your preference! \n\nAt the end of the day, keep wearing the perfume you like, with however many sprays you like to put on - but A LOT of perfume or cologne can be too much in a closed space at times and it sounds like you\u2019re wearing a huge amount. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been doing it that way for 3 years though and she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s said anything I imagine she\u2019s just a one off annoyance that you shouldn\u2019t worry about!", "NTA if people don't like how you smell they can stay away from you. simple as that \ud83d\udc4d", "NEVER apologize for wearing a fragrance you enjoy, NTA.
