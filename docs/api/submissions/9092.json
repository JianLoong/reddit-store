Sounds like your sister is similar to mine, she will never stop behaving in that entitled way, will never stop baiting you until you stand your ground, then will use it against you somehow. Eventually I went NC with my sister and it\u2019s honestly been a blessing. No more BS, no more drama. Not always everyone\u2019s choice but it was the best one I ever made for my family.", "It's changing two letters not one.\n\nI personally don't think it's wrong to say*, I don't really like your choice of names because it's so close to my daughter's name*. \n\nAnd it's probably only okay to say this IF she asks.  If she doesn't ask, she doesn't want your input.\n\nBUT it will make you the A-H to ask her to change it.", "This. If she's doing it on purpose to wind you up then going in hot about it will only give her what she wants. Run with it, don't give her the satisfaction and hopefully she will end up using a different name.  But if she doesn't it's really not the end of the world. Given the age happy they won't be in the same class at school assuming they end up in the same one, and your daughter is clearly going to be the original so it'll be your sister they raise their eyebrows at. I say this as a woman who has the same name as one of her cousins, people tend to see it as unusual but sweet.", "Lol why was this the name that also instantly came to my mind???", "Yuna and her cousin Yuni!", "This is perfect \ud83d\ude2d", "Sure is. I really liked her and her story", "You're the second person to realize that! And I'm including family and friends in that count \ud83e\udd23", "Well, those are quite different names, but of the same....genre, I suppose.\n\nPerhaps that's what's bugging OP, who is YTA.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable so YWBTA this isn\u2019t a Christy and Kristy situation.  They are two separate names.", "Honestly, those names are different enough that I think YWBTA...maybe. How would they be pronounced? \n\nI'm assuming Karliah is \"kar-lie-uh\". Kaliluh could go two ways. \"Kuh-lie-luh\" or \"Kuh-lil-uh\". If it's the first one, yeah that seems odd. I'd expect that naming convention for sibling children, not cousins. If it's the second, that is a distinctly different name.", "Your kid is going to have problems her entire life because of that name \n\nYour kid is a **future adult** who has to be taken seriously. Do you know how obnoxious it is to have a name like that?\n\nName your pets names like that, not actual human beings", "On the other hand, there is a character named Karlirah (sounds similar to your niece's presumptive name) who's just a common woman in Morrowind", "I knew immediately! \ud83e\udd23I love skyrim.", "I wish reddit still had free awards, I'd give you one. Please accept a poor woman's gold: \ud83c\udf96\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc5\ud83e\udd47\n\n*NTA, but for maximum results, OP, do the fake \"honored to have a niece named AFTER your daughter\" thing.\n\nETA: verdict", "Love this response. \nThe meanings of the two names are also very different.", "I agree. These names are different enough that I think OP would be TA for raising a stink. Soft YTA.", "Thank you, Bad Wolf :)", "After reading OP's comments and seeing the names are spelled differently, pronounced differently, and are, in fact, different names entirely - YTA", "The names aren\u2019t the same. YTA", "Based upon OP\u2019s edit - giving the names  - YWBTA.   They are pronounced differently.  I know people  from the same family that are Marlene and Melanie,  Kalie and Katie, Ryan and Brian.", "YWBTA if you did.  Chances are, she is hoping for it.  Just ignore it.  Also, \"Karliah\" and \"Kalilah\" are similar, but not the same thing as swapping an e for an i. If your daughters names were Tess and Jess, would you be confronting her over it?\n\nAdditionally, \"Karliah\" is from the Elder Scrolls, and Kalilah is a name of Arabic origins.  They are not the same, nor just made up by either of you.", "YTA with the added info. Karliah and Kalilah have completely different first and second syllables. Also it\u2019s more than a 1-letter difference. Kalilah doesn\u2019t have an R and has an additional L. Completely different names, just a similar vibe.", "NTA. You can tell her (and honestly I think you should) but don\u2019t expect her to change it. You may need to distance yourself because i can\u2019t imagine it won\u2019t be messy\u2026 I can\u2019t think of any reason why a new mother would want their first child\u2019s name to be that of their niece\u2026", "I would ignore her shes only making a fool of herself. Im pretty sure the rest of your family can see what shes doing.", "NTA but it\u2019s unlikely to do anything other than make her dig in her heels. You\u2019ll push her into defense. Don\u2019t confront, prick. \u201cHow cute, naming your baby after mine, I\u2019m so flattered that you admire my style so much. Adorable!\u201d And flounce. Say much the same to family and friends. Post on social media something vague but pointed like, \u201cImitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\u201d And tag her. Little cheerful, indulgent digs. You are excited to have a niece named for your kid. Delighted that your sister so looks up to you that she yields to your taste in such an important decision. Once firmly in her head, sit back and wait. Copycats hate being called out for copying.", "NTA but you should start telling her and everyone else how excited you are your sister is naming her daughter after yours lol cause complaining will probably cause her to dig her heels in make sure to say your excited she's naming her after your daughter on her Facebook post", "Did you see her edit? The names are not as similar as she made them out to be in the post.", "Maybe she can but what about other people? Not everyone is going to be relative of the baby", "Yes!!!!!  OMG, double down on that nonsense.  Run with it like nobody's business!  :D", "Omg PERFECT!!", "Perfect! I hope she uses this!", "Yes! This!!!!"]}
