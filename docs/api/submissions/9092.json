Deny her that satisfaction. Yes, that would piss me off too. But don't give her that attention she's seeking.

She just wants a reaction from you. If she does do this, it just makes her look like a jealous, attention seeking fool. \n\nEveryone that you both speak to will eventually get on her about it. You could always just spread around how lovely that sounds! She won't like that at all. Narcissistic people hate that someone else is happy. \n\nShe is going to do whatever she wants anyway, so if it were me, I'd be pretending to love the idea. People like her thrive on conflict.

If she\u2019s really that toxic though, assess how and when you want to see her.", "NTA. You might want to talk to her about how it might be confusing to the little girls.

Get a few thrift store baby items monogramed with your baby's spelling  then take them over and be sweet and excited and say you're excited she's reusing the name you chose bc now you can recycle some of the custom items that your daughter has grown out of.

I know it's been talked about with some sass but not much else.

I'm not sure that confronting her will really achieve anything, though, other than give her the attention she wants.", "Are the names pronounced the same?\n\n\nI can understand the frustration but yeah ultimately it's just a name.

Instead of take it as a slight, be honored she is naming her daughter after your daughter. My brother had my Dad's name, I was named after a great Aunt, and my middle name was a cousins first name.  My mom and her brother were both named after her father, I had at least 3 cousins named after my grandfather. Having same names in families is actually not uncommon. While it is understandable you might be annoyed that \" she is copying you\", it is a bit childish to let it get to you that much.   \n\n\nYes, you might be TA if rage at her over her loving the same name as your daughter. It is okay for you both to love the same name, and is not uncommon in families to have cousins of the same name. It is sort of like the older sibling liking blue as their favorite color, it is okay for all of their other siblings to have the same favorite color as well if they want. Siblings are allowed to have same likes and dislikes and simply because you named your child something first, doesn't mean she can't name her child the same. Being \"first\" does not mean you owning all rights to it. You should be flattered she loves the name and your daughter enough to name her daughter after her. This is usually seen as an honor, a show of respect, not a slight.", "YTA. \n\n\n\n\n\nWho cares what she names her baby? What's the purpose?

I actually saw this a lot in the pregnancy forums, some parents actually thought it was fun and cute during family get-togethers when multiple kids shared the same names. It's a matter of perspective. Absolutely express how you feel but you might have to come to terms with her choice and understand that it's her right to use whatever name she wants whether you like it or not.
