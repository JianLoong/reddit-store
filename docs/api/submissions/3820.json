It probably would have meant even more to the children than it would have to her. In my experience children love to choose and wrap gifts for their parents. It wouldn't have had to be expensive, just a token would have done. Since her children didn't know her birthday was coming up I assume none of your family planned to do anything special even though it was her 40th. I think that is really sad. I think your daughter was wrong for punishing her children but I think she was probably hurt that no-one made a fuss. I assume that she does not receive mother's day or Christmas gifts from her children either. In my extended family we always make sure that the children get to choose, buy and wrap little gifts for their parents. In fact I can't think of any family where this is not done.To see the excitement on a child's face when choosing these is worth the small outlay.
