If you live near her, let your grandkids know you're a safe space to go when they inevitably run away.\n\n(Also the many anxiety issues they gonna get)", "NTA I can see why the bf left", "Nah your daughter is TA in this situation, she sounds like she is unhinged if i were you i\u2019d be worried about my grandkids, and if she continues to ground them for stupid sh*t like this then they may to start to spiral in their behaviour because either way they are gonna get punished so they might as well have a reason for the punishment.", "NTA. Be very concerned for your grandchildren. This type of emotional abuse may be a weekly or daily behavior.\nCan you have them visit for a weekend? It may take some time to open up about what's happening, but someone needs to check on them.", "NTA. She just proved why her boyfriend left. She's likely yelled at him and the children this way during their relationship. I feel bad for your grandchildren. Please help them.", "You're right, children don't think of these things themselves, but why haven't you or other family thrown her a birthday celebration? She's alone, just turned 40!\n\nMy son and his wife split up, but they still help their daughter draw cards for each other at birthday time.

Nope, you're entirely right and I'm a little worried about your grandkids now.", "NTA. Not only do they probably not really understand data, but wtf are they going to get the money from to buy her something? I didn\u00b4t really have my own money until I was a late teen. If she wanted a gift so badly she could have given them money to buy her something, anything, like my mother did.", "NTA. Where does she think they will get the money from or get to a place to buy anything. At that age presents from us were either homemade or my other parents money .", "Nta... Either your daughter is insane or she was hoping you'd step up and help the kids \"buy\" the gifts given the father is out of the picture", "NTA but I'd be seriously concerned for those kids. Their dad straight up abandoned them (no matter his beef with their mom, that's inexcusable) and your daughter clearly has unrealistic expectations for children their age.", "NTA.  She could have made it fun by giving them a little bit of money and taking them to a cheap store and letting them get her something to surprise her with on the day.  I did this at Christmas when my kids were little so they could enjoy the giving part as well as the getting.  Hopefully she doesn\u2019t blame them for other stuff out of their control as well.", "NTA for calling her out for this incredibly toxic and unhealthy behavior. Children need to be taught these things explicitly and guided through it so that by the time they are teens or adults they can do them  independently, as you know. \n\nAre the children emotionally safe with her otherwise? Does she regularly yell and shame them?", "Yta for name calling your daughter. She\u2019s not insane, she is having a shit day. Be a good mother and go over there, take her kids shopping for their mom and then drop off dinner. This answer is so obvious. Help or shut up.", "NTA \n\nI feel sorry for your grandchildren.", "I'm gonna go for ESH. \n\nYour daughter clearly isn't thinking straight, as 8 (and 5) year old kids aren't going to remember their mum's birthday and then go out of their way to buy a gift. \n\nHowever, she's also obviously struggling a bit. How hard would it have been for you to step in and make sure the kids got her something (or at least made her a homemade card or whatever)? The ex-boyfriend clearly isn't going to do that so the situation is entirely predictable. Of course she's feeling alone and as if nobody is thinking of her. \n\nAs a parent / grandparent I think you could maybe have stepped up and done a little bit better at making her feel loved.\n\nSincerely, \n\nPerson who buys the husband Christmas / birthday gifts from the cat.", "NTA, but as a grandma, I'm sure your alarm bells are going off.  This isn't normal. My daughter is 2, but I wasn't in a position to get anyone gifts until I got a job. I'm afraid these kids are being abused in some way.", "NTA. Your daughter is a narcissist. She will never understand your criticism. I have a relative in my own family who treats her kids the same way. It's been terrible for the kids.", "NTA, sounds like your daughter has been going through a lot lately, she clearly needs therapy. The situation might be worse, the kids will grow up into an unhealthy environment, thus resulting into more issues.", "NTA I can see why the boyfriend left. I would contact him and suggest he go for full custody of the kids.", "NTA\n\nI was a single mom for 2 years with 3 of my kids they are 9, 6 and 2! I never expect my kids to buy me gifts but I do have a calendar and mark birthdays and important occasions and they look at it every day and they even do countdowns. But this is me teaching them to do so not expecting them to know. She is being selfish and expecting so much from her kids. My girls will make me a card and that\u2019s the best thing ever. I don\u2019t expect them to do it but it\u2019s amazing. I personally don\u2019t want gifts spending time with my family is the gift and that\u2019s what I teach my kids because not everyone can afford gifts especially in this economy.", "NTA and clearly the behavior you just saw is why her boyfriend left. I think you need to be more concerned about your grandchildren, their environment and the care they are receiving. Your daughter needs mental health help.", "\ufeff", "NTA. I was a kid who was treated like this. It's a real thing and I hope you get a chance to tell the kids they shouldn't be in trouble for this because it is pretty crazy-making, especially in the longterm.", "ESH. Your daughter is stressed by raising 2 kids on her own. Instead of sympathizing or helping, you make sarcastic comments. I bet those kids know when their own birthdays are, & they are old enough to wish their mom a happy birthday. At the same time, it\u2019s on your daughter to teach them how to act. She could have sat down with them & some paper & crayons and helped them make her a card.", "The children need help & possibly saving from this mother .", "YTA. Not for what you said. But for not being there for your grandchildren.\nYour daughter needs help.\n\nCutting her some slack isn't going to make it.

I also have been through years of therapy and likely will be for the rest of my life. This is abuse, plain and simple. And it will get worse. \n\nHelp those kids.", "Why didn't you take YOUR grandchildren shopping to buy something for YOUR daughter's birthday?", "Yta if you don't look into how she's treating these kids. That is insane behavior, and a huge red flag.", "YTA for understanding she is a single mother with very little support and not taking the kids shopping or at least help them make a card or bake a cake. 40 is a BFD! \n\nShe is also an asshole for treating her children so badly. That\u2019s awful and they don\u2019t deserve that. \n\nGetting your daughter some help is the best way of getting your grandchildren some help.", "NTA sounds like she needs some therapy and the grandkids need a vacation with grandma.", "I seriously doubt you remembered your parent's birthdates on your own when you were that young. Your other parent would have reminded you. And maybe grandma should have helped them get a card but for the daughter to PUNISH her children because her feelings were hurt is ridiculous and abusive. If she is feeling overwhelmed she needs to ask for help. Not take her frustrations out on her innocent children.", "Or possible narcissism.", "Oh my gosh, poor kiddos. Is there anything you can do for those kids because they do not seem to be growing up in a stable, loving situation.", "Poor kids, they WILL remember this forever and THIS is going to be the thing they'll think of on every one of her future birthdays - the fact that they HAVE to please her, not that they want to.

Please keep an eye on her.", "she grounded a 5 and 8 year old?! \n\nLady, respectfully YTA if you don\u2019t get something done to help your grandchildren.
