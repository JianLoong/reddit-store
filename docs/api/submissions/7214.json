Ate \\[My name\\] will give it to you\" while looking at me with expectant eyes. I quickly her that no, I will not be giving it to him and that he should give it back which caused him to start crying. Her and my mom were stunned to hear me refuse, my distant relative promptly got up on her seat to shout at me, calling me a \"selfish brat\" and such which caused her child to cry more from hearing her scream.

I told her no because I really don't want to because it's not just a cheap toy that cost me 5$ but it was expensive due to it being a merch (it was 45$ in conversion rate from my country's currency to USD) and I saved up my allowance and lined-up to buy that plushie, but she told me that she and my distant relative got into a dispute because of how I was berated earlier.

Yes I\u2019m old). \n\nI looked at my mom dead in the eye and replied \u201cI bought that dvd. It\u2019s mine. You do not get to give anything that\u2019s mine away. I\u2019m sorry your nieces will be deprived of a movie but it\u2019s rude to give away something that you know damn well is mine. My answer is no.\u201d WOW MY MOM WAS FURIOUS and she kept trying to guilt trip me but I was like NOPE. She tried to complain to my sister and even she was like \u201cma, are you for real? That\u2019s rude that you were trying to give away something that you know damn well you didn\u2019t buy.\u201d My mom was very short with me for weeks and my pops was annoyed with her and literally told her \u201cif it matters so damn much buy a dvd yourself!\u201d When she realized that it wasn\u2019t available anywhere, she finally calmed down.

I just got back in here after a long day and I am surprised to see a lot of responses, I'd like to give a thank you to all of you out there telling me that I am not a jerk for refusing to give a kid my plushie, validating my refusal. And I agree that it should serve as a lesson not only to the kid but also my relative/his mom. Maybe if it was just a 5-dollar plushie that I bought, I would have given it but that's not the case. Also, I've seen that a lot of you have also went through a similar experience and I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you get to keep your plushies and got lots of it, there is no too old for plushies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, as I see some comments in here calling my mom an as\\*hole and/or cussing my mom, I'd like to ask those people & people who will do the same to please refrain from doing so. My choice of words may not be the best earlier so it wasn't explained the best. No, my mom wasn't gaslighting me when she confronted me, she just talked to me lightly and the part where she told me that I should've just given it, she explained to me that I already had a bad reputation with that relative and her family because of the fact that I always give that relative the stink eye whenever she's over (obviously) and this just made my reputation go down the drain. My mom told me that she was just worried about how I will look to other distant relatives and how I will be treated and seen during family reunions and as such when that relative gossips about this to other relatives. I really couldn't care less about how that relative and her family's view of me, because she herself has the reputation of being a leech. And yes, my mom did defend me earlier through chatting with that relative, my mom explained to her that while my mom understand that kids wants a lot of \"cute things\" and are sensitive to rejection, she \\[my relative\\] had NO right to berate me like that and most importantly in my mom's house.\n\nI guess I can say that this happening had a good outcome for me and most importantly my mother, because I saw in their chat earlier that my mom said \"I let you borrow money all the time even if we both know that you're not paying, what you did earlier was unacceptable, you had no right to berate my daughter like that and until an apology is given to her, I will not be letting you invite yourself over and borrow money from me\" (translated). No apology has been given yet, not that I care about her nor either an apology from her, all I want from her is to stay away the hell from my mother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may or may not change your perception of my mom, but I'd like to guarantee one thing: my mother is a kind mother and a kind person, extremely too kind to be exact. As much as I dislike her extreme kindness for that, I wouldn't change that attribute of her as it makes her her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this far. I hope that you will all have a great weekend! :)", "NTA but hide the plushie. It may vanish because X loved it so. I suspect relative is your's Mother's charity case and she is ok with spending the money because it keeps her and the young boy close enough someone can monitor. I suspect that she also thinks that as the boy likely has few toys (mother had at 15?), you could give up one toy. But that is her decision to give money and she shouldn't expect you to give up your possessions. \n\nI'd suggest spending $10 and getting an age appropiate toy - a lot of toys are not so suitable for young children due to loose eyes/trim etc. Offer to your Mum to give as a peace offering. But stress your plushies aren't small child appropiate and very dear to you as represent memories and achievements. You won't be bad to not get the toy but might help with building relationship with Mum and child alike. \n\nAlso I suspect your relative would resell the merch toy and boy wouldn't see it anyway.

I got into a similar experience when I was a child with my grandmother so I know how this feels. I hope you at least have a lot of hot wheels now!", "Exactly this...I have a panda Squishmallow that I love...that a friend saw and also loved. So I had a different one shipped to her house as a surprise and she was stoked!\n\nIf someone were to \"demand\" my stuff...at this point in my life I'll burn it to ash first!\n\nOP is NTA", "Sorry to hear about your son's passing. No you weren't overreacting, it's an object with a deep sentiment not only for you but for your youngest as well so your reaction was perfectly valid. I hope that that plushie stays with you guys for a lifetime. Have a great week! :)", "Sorry to hear that you experienced this! I just wanna say that there's no such thing as being too old for harmless things that makes you happy! It's a perfectly reasonable that you refused seeing that the DVD was hard to get. I'm glad that you got to keep your stuff! \n\nHave a great day! :)", "Their visitation is not up to me to be honest, it's my mother's house so I don't let myself interfere or decide who my mom accepts in our house. But oftentimes that relative just invites herself over just by giving a quick text/chat that she's just minutes away from our house so it's not like my mom accepts their visitation either.", "Oo filo ako HAHAHAHHAHAH\n\nYeah, I really dislike this mentality of Filos na \"nakakatanda ako kaya dapat respetuhin at sundin mo ako, kahit nakakabastos na ako\" or yung \"hayaan mo na, ganyan talaga mga bata\".\n\nSorry to hear about how your mom is being treated, I hope na magiging triple yung money na makukuha ng mama mo back lalo na ngayong mahal na ang sibuyas! Lots of luck! :)", "The plushie (Koya) that I bought was a merch (BT21) by a favorite band. I saved up for it and lined-up with my brother to buy it when the merch first got in our country. I admit that there's a quite a lot of stores now in our country that sells it, online shops even, but I still don't feel like giving it away just like that sorry to say.", "Clearly it was important to OP so your question is pointless. There is no reason to indulge a spoiled child no matter how easily it might be replaced.", "If it's merch, it's probably not available anymore,  I'd find one on eBay and show it to your mother, I'd be willing to bet she wouldn't be interested in paying double or triple the $45 you spent to buy another. And if she is congrats, she can buy it herself.", "Thank you! We have it in a safe spot! I'm sorry your not getting support when you don't want to give away things you value, I hope that stops and you have a great week!", "You're right. I should have led with NTA, the info doesn't really change anything it's just nice to know.\n\nIf however, it were not sentimental, and merely expensive (yet easy) to replace, it might have been better to make it the Mom's problem. This has no bearing on right or wrong, just practicality.", "Facts \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb"]}
