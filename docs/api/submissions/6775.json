They favored her, and gave her everything she asked for. They both made a lot of money, and sent her to a very nice private school, while I went to a weakly-funded public school two blocks from my house.

The youngest kid is often indulged compared to elder ones and they're rarely aware of it. \n\nI think it would be a leap for an adopted child (if she knew she was adopted) to assume their parents would prefer them to a bio kid. Thats an unusual dynamic. Similarly, most kids with a disability would be insecure about that and think everyone would love the \"normal\" kid more.", "You're definitely NTA. I'm glad to hear your sister is in your corner.  \n\nI would point out that \n\n1.you're a boy because of your dad (it's his stuff that determines if it's a boy or girl)\n\n2. you're not as intelligent or social as your sister due to the gene pool you came from (them)\n\n3. thanks to their gene pool, they couldn't produce a golden child so they had to adopt\n\nGo NC with them but you will run into them at events.  Don't care what others think.  As I've always told my kids, there's your blood family then there's your soul family, those that love and nurture you.  Care more about your soul family and learn to not care what your blood family says.\n\nI'm glad you'll seek counseling because this is a huge emotional scar you carry with you.  Best of luck in the future", "My mom is like this, but the it\u2019s the opposite in terms of gender. She favors my brother over me because I\u2019m the screw up daughter that she never wanted. She told me that I was the reason why my dad left her (untrue, I\u2019ve spoken to my dad on this multiple times because he can see it still bothers me)\n\nWhat she doesn\u2019t realize is I have built up my own family and as soon as I leave here (I\u2019ve been caring for her for the past 9 months because she broke her leg and it hasn\u2019t healed properly) I\u2019m not looking back and won\u2019t contact her any further. Am I selfish for my own well-being? Yes. Does she deserve anything else from me, after trying to destroy any chance I had at happiness? Hell no. Please reach out if you need a friend! If going low contact or no contact is an option, I\u2019d take it. Be safe friend.", "NTA, cut off your parents completely. And the relatives as well.", "She was there and saw you not getting gifts and parties and it didn't occur to her that you were being treated badly at the time? Wow!", "Tell your parents that you have their genes, so maybe your sister had a huge advantage because she didn't have their terrible natural tendencies to overcome (on top of their shitty parenting).", "Just like my mother. She had 7 children just for bragging rights.", "You're better off tho. I cut off my family because they were awful. Don't miss them.", "How did she rationalize going to private school whyou went to public school?", "\"I dunno, it's either nature or nurture...... Do you think it's the shit way you raised me or your crappy genetics?\"", "Clear and concise. Photos of birthdays, the schooling situation, the refusal to help with higher education. Being the unwanted child is one of the biggest burdens and hurt one can carry, and it seems  you held yourself up with grace and dignity. Take care of yourself first and foremost, know you didn't deserve this and enjoy your relationship with your sister.\n\nETA: ah, saw your comment as an email you could send them, but yeah, you're damn right. And you shouldn't have to prove it yourself, but if your extended family are being ahs about it and you want to tell your side of the story do so, but you owe nobody ANYTHING.", "NTA, but I think distancing yourself from your parents and lots of therapy is what you need, my guy.", "NTA\n\n>They held a dinner party, where they openly talked about how they wish they had another golden child like my sister. They then asked me why I couldn\u2019t be like her.\n\nYou - \"Maybe if I had such supportive parents like my sister had, I might have had a chance.\"\n\nI'm glad your comments show your sister is at least on your side. Are you able to go NC with your parents and still be able to stay in contact with sister?", "This has to be fake. There\u2019s no way lol", "NTA. Remind your parents that it's their genes and their parenting that made you who you are -- and that you have now overcome the disadvantages they saddled you with and want nothing more to do with them.", "Nta\n Truth hurts.", "Nta, I feel bad for op it\u2019s time to go NC", "NTA\n\nHighly suggesting going NC and even LC with sister as she definitely knew as other people pointed out, and if she's not backing you with extended family and taking a clear stance, then she's continuing to use you.", "Post your story and tag family. Your parents are disgusting!", "NTA - They told you the truth. Now that you know, you can make whatever choice you want about the amount of future contact you feel comfortable having with them with a clear conscience.", "NTA. Please go NC with your family for your sanity. I'm sorry that they treated you like this. I'm proud of you for speaking your truth. Fuck your parents and your sister. Your sister saw the way they treated you. She's not blind.", "NTA\n\nyour parents are a couple of words-I-can't-say-or-I'll-be-banned.", "NTA. At least your sister supports you. Do you have a therapist? If so discuss going no contact with your family other than your sister. A good therapist can help you set and maintain boundaries.", "NTA. You didn't over overreact. You said what needed to be said. Now move on they told you what they think of you. As for any family backing them and bad mouthing you. Block and walk away. They'll need you be for you need them. When that time comes Laugh and keep walking.", "Dude! My father opened a business and asked me to be in charge of the warehouse. I took a pay cut, but I figured it could work out in the long run. Turned into a perpetually underfunded warehouse. Hell, I had to go out and buy all of the cleaning supplies out of my own pocket. I figured it is just starting. We will fix it. We'll, we did not. I mean, we were a fairly high volume flooring shop doing hundreds of new homes a year... but he had us keeping inventory using pen and paper. Not even notebooks... loose printer paper.  Oh, did I mention we didn't even have racks for the first two years? Just piling everything on the floor and having to shift half of everything everything we needed something. If something needed to be done, I did it. No questions asked, no overtime. Things did not run like clockwork because I didn't even have a sundial. What we did was millions in revenue through a stoneaged warehouse.\n\n\nAnyways, the second year, he threw a Christmas party. He went around the room pouring praise on each employee. I was last... and least... because he shit all over me in a room full of 30 employees and their spouses. I sat there mortified, and crushed. My wife was literally speechless. Having to sit there at this formal dinner getting fucked on in front of 50 people by my own father broke me.\n\nSo, I get you man.\n\nNTA times four hundred trillion. Fuck your parents. I hate them.", "[removed]", "NTA, fuck your parents.", "NTA.  Not even a tiny bit.  Listen to your friend!\n\nBe proud of yourself,  because you sound like you are doing well despite it all.  As the old saying goes, living well is the best revenge.", "NTA\n\nBlatant favoritism. Might be time to cut the negativity out of your life. If they can't appreciate you for the simply fact that you are their son then they don't deserve to have you in their life.\n\nYou will be better off without the unnecessary hurt and drama they all bring.\n\nEventually the truth will out but by then it will be too little WAY FAR too late.", "No no no, you're NTA.\n\nI am sorry to hear your parents being so neglectful, you did nothing to deserve it. \n\n> They then asked me why I couldn\u2019t be like her. \n\nShitty behaviour playing kids against each other, comparing them.\n\n> By the end of the argument, they admitted they never wanted a son, and always wanted a child that would impress people and who would make them look good.\n\nDisgusting. They should have never had kids.\n\nYou're not at fault. If you have a good relationship to your sister maintain it, as it isn't her fault either. With your parents do as you please, you don't owe them anything. If it makes you feel better go low or no contact. And maybe consider therapy if it's available and affordable for you, so you can unlearn their gaslighting you.", "I agree! As a mother and stepmother of 2 boys I can say they are the lights of my life. I don\u2019t want to trade them for a girl (and if they were girls I would not want to trade them for boys either). I don\u2019t have a daughter and I would welcome one but if I am lucky enough to get more children I would not mind if they are boys or girls. Children are great, regardless of their gender. Favoring a child is awful, and even more if it is because of a gender. \n\nOP, your parents are horrible and they don\u2019t deserve you at all. They put so much pressure on you to be exactly like your sister that they did not see everything you have and are. You are awesome as a human being and they put you through so much trouble. Comparing children is so wrong. Every child has its own qualities.", "Also it seems they chose to adopt this particular child not because they loved her but because she is automatically disabled and will make them look good for raising one. So they chose someone who is disabled but not so much as to actually need extra effort on their end. They are assholes to both OP and his sister and she doesn't even realize it.", "They also admitted they adopted the sister so they can look good, *not* because they wanted a child that needed a home. And what would make them look better than a disabled child? They basically ignored one child and used the other one as a prop. I think sister might have realised that after hearing the full story from OP. The fact sister stands by OP might also be because she noticed it (being deaf doesn't mean you don't see things happening around you), but maybe not in the extent it actually was, hence her not adressing their parents about it sooner.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You can only improve your life .nta", "I'm glad to hear you and your sister seem to be able to still have a relationship, despite this toxicity. In my experience, having someone else who was there for all of it validate that you really did face unfairness can be very important in helping heal from it.", "Sometimes it's okay to be the villain in other people's stories so long as it brings you peace", "This was my first thought. They do not deserve their family's respect.", "I wonder why OP wants to stay in contact with such parents who treated him so badly. No one deserves to be treated as 2nd class citizen at their own home. OP is still soft in confronting his parents. He should Tell them they wanted a trophy child to show off to people. When their gene is not that good to produce one they adopted s disabled child to show off to people how good they are! And created a golden child by providing all to her and depriving their own blood.", "It's not impossible for someone to change and grow, though. Sometimes a dynamic that's obvious from the outside won't become clear to someone on the inside until it's pointed out to them. She could be aware of the facts and not have had a lightbulb moment until OP pointed it out. \n\nShe's also 24, which means that she's probably just in the very recent past or present becoming financially independent, which changes things. People who were raised seeing their siblings get mistreated can be aware that it's wrong, but be afraid to speak out while they're still dependent on their parents, because they know that it'll have blowback on them. That doesn't mean that she's manipulative.\n\nWe don't know her. Maybe she will fall back into old dynamics after this fight, but maybe it'll be a turning point for her. And either way, her affirming that she's seen disparate treatment is validating for OP, whether she sticks with him or not.", "All of this!", "If your parents are always telling you that this is right and this is the way things should be, it can be hard to deprogram that, especially if you're subconsciously afraid that if you question them, they'll retaliate.", "More than just luck. They invested heavily in her education and life in a way they didn't for OP. But yes, luck certainly played a part."]}
