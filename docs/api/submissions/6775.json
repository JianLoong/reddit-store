She is deaf, and learned to lead lips incredibly well. She also got better grades and had more friends (I had a few while she was very social despite her disabilities) than me as a child, and my parents always called her the \u201cbest gift they could\u2019ve asked for\u201d. They favored her, and gave her everything she asked for. They both made a lot of money, and sent her to a very nice private school, while I went to a weakly-funded public school two blocks from my house. When I was 11, I was made fun of and bullied by a kid in my class, and my father told me to toughen up. I went to my a teacher (who filed a report to the principal, who didn\u2019t do much) later, and my father called me weak for going to my teacher about a bully. The birthday parties for me were not really parties, but where I asked them to make my favorite dinner and they reluctantly agreed. My sister received massive parties, where my parents typically got her around 10 expensive gifts on top of everything else. They funded her college education in full, while they had told me to make do with the tiny bits of money they gave me for chores that I had been saving. More recently, they have asked me straight to my face why I wasn\u2019t as intelligent, social, and successful as my sister (mind you I make 20k more than her with no degree). Recently, she got engaged to a guy, who I\u2019m currently good friends with and even learned sign language for my sister early in their relationship. They held a dinner party, where they openly talked about how they wish they had another golden child like my sister. They then asked me why I couldn\u2019t be like her. I got up, and asked to talk to them outside. I told them that they were neglectful assholes who never cared about me, and that they were bad parents. I then argued with them further, and they said that they were simply trying to make her feel better about her disability. By the end of the argument, they admitted they never wanted a son, and always wanted a child that would impress people and who would make them look good. I left angrily, and told my best friend about it, who said that it was good that I stranded up to them. However, the rest of my family (excluding my sister) believed that I was an ungrateful, whiny bitch who never appreciated what I had (of course this is after years of my parents telling them lies and after they told them a twisted version of the conversation).

But I also doubt your sis didn't know about this uneven treatment you both get cause she gets everything she wants from them no hesitations, while even though you asked, your parents still reluctantly agree to do it. Also, when your father told you to toughen up and called you weak for going to a teacher about it shows that your parents are neglectful and that they definitely played favorites", "Agree with everyone else here, NTA and you should very much consider putting some distance between you and your parents. You need to look out for yourself and you don\u2019t have to keep putting up with people who are abusive. You exploded from years\u2026decades of this. Put some distance there and get into some counseling.

People used to be like your mom is awesome, and I'd be like \"yeah she's a great mom to my brother, but not too all of us.\" She treats my other brothers decently well, but treats me like I'm not her daughter. She treats 2 of my brothers' wives better than me even.\n\nETA: I believe you because my brother that is the favorite doesn't understand why the rest of us say that he's the favorite. When you're the favorite, your life is so good that you don't realize your siblings are being treated poorly. My 3rd brother used to leave the house and tell me to call him when my parents were done fighting so he could come home instead of taking me with him.  I was the youngest. I shouldn't have been in charge of that. He should have protected me. But tbh it made me a stronger person than he is. He's very sheltered.", "NTA. \n\nYour parents sound like terrible people. My one piece of advice would be: Don't expect them to change. They will never see your perspective, or waver from their story that you were an awful child. So, for your own sake, you'll need to accept that about them, and give up hope of having a fulfilling relationship with them. \n\nI'm very glad for you that your sister is thinking about what you told her. It seems like she'll change her perspective on them, with time.", "NTA\n\nDude, you were awesome.  You didn't make a scene.  You spoke to them in private. You said the truth and actually got them to admit that they were shitty fucking parents to you too.", "NTA \n \nOf course NTA.\n \nWhat does your sister say about this?
