They favored her, and gave her everything she asked for. They both made a lot of money, and sent her to a very nice private school, while I went to a weakly-funded public school two blocks from my house.

I\u2019m glad you have each other.", "Validation from family is a hell of itself", "I'd say go speak with your parents and wait for the time, the best time when they have relatives and friends surrounded and bring this up again, asking why you're not like your sister, and you must respond \"genes\".\n\nSay - \"She was adopted and so definitely not either of your genes are in her. And that must be it.\"\n\nNTA", "Nta\nI love the fact your sister is on your side too. Go NC with your parents but keep your sister in your life for sure. I'm glad she found a guy so well suited for her and you also like. Your parents suck.", "NTA and glad to hear it sounds like your sister is on your side. She was younger and a kid so it\u2019s not surprising she didn\u2019t give the disparity in your childhoods a second glance. The fact that she is willing to acknowledge it now is a good step. You should seek out therapy for yourself and go no contact with your parents. Clearly they bring nothing of value by maintaining a relationship with them.", "NTA. I\u2019m truly sorry that you had a childhood like that. But be proud because you got through it better than perhaps someone else in a similar situation would i.e. illicit drugs etc.", "NTA. At this point I would distance myself from them all. Initially I thought they were over compensating because of her being adopted and having a disability. As I kept reading I realized they were just horrible people who treated you like shit. Having the same blood alone does not make someone your family as you\u2019re well aware. I say fuck them all and go live your best life. There will come a time when they will come to you for something. I would not bother with them even then. Life is too short to have to deal with people who obviously do not love or care for you. Fuck all of them.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry. As a someone who grew up in a house with favoritism good for you for speaking up to them about it.  And i agree with the others who said go ahead and tell everyone the truth.", "Your parents sound like two narcissists who found each other. They \"got\" (I don't want to say adopted because their intentions weren't to provide a home) a disabled child that made them look good for raising. Her success was (ableistly seen as even further proof of their parenting skills) \n\nI don't think they ever loves your sister. They just loved the attention and praise she brought your parents.\n\nImo They bought her to get love and admiration.\n\nAnd I'm an adoptee and that stuff makes me sick. Perfect little children bought for any other purpose than providing the best home possible. \n\nYour parents seem only concerned with getting praise. And they are so easily to admit they basically never wanted you.\n\nSomething is not on in their heads. They are terrible people.\n\nYou are NTA. I'm so so so sorry you grew up with two people who got a kid only to be praised for the dutiful work it takes to raise a disabled adoptee. *world's smallest violin playing for them*", "NTA but you can\u2019t argue with stupid, it sounds like you need distance from them. You won\u2019t get the love and support you should", "For your own sanity, please go no contact, after you air all the dirty laundry of these horrible people!!!", "That got me too, like holy sh*t.", "I honestly think your parents may be on the Narcissist Personality Disorder spectrum.\n\nThey care about the accolades and praise and attention they receive for raising a disable adoptee rather than actually caring about your sister. \n\nThey readily and kinda easily admitted to you they never wanted you and wanted another child they could show off\n\nYour sister is the prized pig in the county fair. Sure, they love the pig until they don't need it. \n\nAnd since a lot of your family members don't believe you, it may be because NPD people show a false mask. Your parents seem like a Marty couple doing what they can for your sister. They sacrificed time and resources on her. And that's what they *think* they know. So they don't believe you because it contradicts with what they think the truth is.\n\nManipulative people do this. Your sister believes you because she grew up in your house and listening to you probably makes a lot of things finally make sense to her. \n\nI'm not sure if your parents are NPD but they sure are Manipulative and neglectful/abusive.\n\nIt seems like the community believes your parents are angels for raising your sister which is the sole reason they got your sister.", ">my relatives again or try to tell them the truth.\n\nAre you talking about the relatives who did nothing to protect you?", "You need to get distant with those people.", "Thirded on the update", "Why do people just not bother telling everyone the truth. Then these problems solve them selves", "NTA sounds like your only true family is your sister unfortunately. The rest of them are not acting like family should.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo no contact with your abusive AH parents.", "NTA - my parents did the same to me while my younger brother was the golden child. I recently went NC with the whole lot of them so I could heal the wounds they inflicted, and let them go to their \"higher power \" with love and light, in perfect love and perfect trust. My lack of memories have helped, as they come back, I work through them. I had MANY years of therapy before that have gotten me to the point that I am able to most of this work on my own. If I needed to, I would go back to my therapist if I needed help to get through it.", "NTA", "Make a public announcement of their neglect. Im sos sorry you have had to go through this. NTA", "NTA.\n\nAnd when parents expect you to pay for their retirement, tell them to sponge off their Golden Child.", "NTA. Everyone has a breaking point, a moment where enough is enough, and it sounds like you've hit it. It sounds to me like you are putting the blame where it belongs, and not on your sister, which stands to your character. I think children should be loved and cared for as equally as possible within their needs. Tell the people you love and want in your life the truth of what happened. Either they consider what you're telling them or they don't, but they do deserve to hear the truth and you deserve to be able to tell them that truth. Good luck to you!", "Hi", "NtA\n\nMy heart goes out to you, good job doing well for yourself despite them.\n\nDon\u2019t let the AHs confuse you, it\u2019s them - all them.\n\nAnd you were kinder than me - I would\u2019ve told them I got their genes obviously. (When they asked why you could t be like her.)\n\nYour poor sister was their token, so sad.", "I\u2019m not surprised she does(or seems too). As an adoptee myself, Unfortunately, you find that this is not an uncommon motivation when it comes to adoption. Although, she may not have been aware of their neglect, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she had at least an inkling of their intentions at some point.", "NTA. You have nothing to prove. Cut the parents out of your life and celebrate being you. Family is something we create, blood is irrelevant. Good luck.", "NTA, they are completely horrible.  I feel for you and know how painful it is to hear them say things like to you.  I have a twin sister and was treated exactly like you.  I walked away and tried to reconcile years later but realized it was healthier to keep them out of my life.", "NTA and F your parents. They're losers living in their daughters success. Don't give them an ounce of your time OP. Tell everyone what they said and how they treated you and walk away. People like your parents won't change.", "NTA...looks like you called it right. I'm sorry you got stuck with them. I'm sure you will be able to do better", "NTA. Fuck your parents (needed to be said) I hope you find your way my guy. Much love", "NTAH, the fact that you put up with it this long shows how strong you are.  you got the truth now u can move on without them in your life  . u did good", "Maybe she should talk to your other relatives too and you'd have more people who hold your back!\nI feel so sorry for you, OP. Of course you are NTA!", "Email them the link to this post.", "That was my first thought! Nice to find a petty partner!", "I agree scorched earth time.", "NTA", "Cut of the parents. Tell your side to the rest, then cut of any who still think you're in the wrong.", "NTA. You deserved better, I am sorry you did not get it.  But you can, going forward, choose whom to invest your love and attention in.\nBe proud of what you have accomplished so far, as you have done it despite a very significant disadvantage in the form of a heavy load on your heart.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you had to grow up in those conditions. The best thing to do is to publically refute the lies, give any proof if you can, then go out and succeed in making the best life for yourself.", "Bless your heart. Definitely NTA. I hope you find peace. You are worthy of love.", "This is the way.", "This mum wishes she could climb through the internet and give you a hug. You are worthy of love, your parents not so much. virtual hugs to you.", "I'm super proud of him too - but take it from me - as someone who spent a \\*lifetime\\* trying to prove myself to a parent who refused to see me for who I was, you can't do it. You just can't. It wasn't until I realized that the simple fact was that my father didn't want \\*me\\*. Me. That nothing I did would please him until I became someone else - that was when I was finally able to set myself free from him. It's \\*soul-crushing\\* to spend years trying and failing to get that validation.  OP deserves so much better than that. He needs to find \\*his\\* people, the ones who will love and support him as he is, and as who he \\*wants\\* to become."]}
