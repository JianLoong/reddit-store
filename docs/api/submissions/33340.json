These would be reasons to end a friendship, for sure.\n\nHowever, friends don\u2019t owe you romantic relationships, you are romantically interested in her and she doesn\u2019t feel the same way. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re talking from a place of hurt and disappointment, rather than seeing the reality that she\u2019s a great friend who just doesn\u2019t want to sleep with you. You feel like you\u2019ve been \u201cfriend zoned\u201d, but actually, this was never romantic, you had a great best friend, but you developed feelings for her. \n\nYou\u2019re both hurting in this scenario so I don\u2019t think either of you is an AH and it seems to me that the best solution is some time apart for the feelings to settle and you can figure out what you want to be in each others lives from now on. \n\nNAH.", "NTA. A friendship is not a contract. You don't want to be friends, and it's probably not great for you. I don't see any real issue.", "NTA, you can't expect her to be your gf, but she cant expect your feelings to magically go away. You made a reasonable statement that to deal with this you need a bit more distance, if she disagrees with that, thats on her. Good thing you stood up for yourself here, ive been in the exact situation and it can be super mentally draining.", "Sounds perfectly reasonable to me - NTA", "Nta", "NTA. That's a bummer. But look, you did the right thing for yourself. It's not cool to be in a one-sided thing. Give yourself some time to heal and then get back out there. You'll find someone who's down for what you want, trust.", "NTA\n\nYou're her human teddy bear.\n\nI spent two years in high school in the same situation and learned 25 years later I missed spending those years with a fantastic woman that really wanted to date me.\n\nShe's using you, so definitely end it regardless of how she responds.\n\nIf she really wanted to be with you it would have happened.", "NAH. You like her as more than a friend. She likes you as a friend, and you're there for her more than she is for you. She doesn't \"owe you\" more than friendship just because you pick up the phone at 1am. You sound like you think being there for her at all hours means this is heading for more than friendship, and she's letting you know it isn't.", "Good for you homie. You are acting like the king you are and I\u2019m proud of you. If it makes a difference, I\u2019m 38 years old and have been there.\n\nHere\u2019s what is going to happen. You\u2019re going to work on yourself and lift those weights while thinking about her - giving yourself that little edge of anger and spite (it\u2019s ok in doses). And just like clockwork, another lucky-ass WOMAN is going to go \u201cwait a second.. yeah he\u2019s hot\u201d and you\u2019re going to be the lesson your \u201cfriend\u201d hasn\u2019t learned yet. \n\nI swear to god, when you get to my age you\u2019ve seen this bullshit play out so many times you just roll your eyes and get back to work.\n\nProud of you man.", "She doesn't owe you anything, but it can be very disappointing for women when men just pretend to be friends with them to get in their pants.

There's no such thing as normal friendship between opposite genders , either one or both will develop feelings eventually. It seems like you love her more than she loves you.

If you can\u2019t just be friends then be nothing.", "NTA, you have expectations, so does she. They\u2019re not compatible so you break it off and move on. It\u2018s sad for the friendship but the same way that she doesn\u2019t owe you romantic relationships, you don\u2019t owe her friendship if it\u2019s hurtful to you", "NTA. You're doing what's best for both of you even if she doesn't like it. \n\nHave been in similar situations in my late teens and can certainly say distancing yourself a bit is doing the right thing for both of you. Otherwise you'll just get more hurt down the line when she starts dating someone, and I can imagine the person she's dating wouldn't be a huge fan of her calling random guys up at 1am etc too", "I do think OP is hurt. And I do think it\u2019s valid for him to take a step back because he developed unreciprocated feelings. That can turn into jealousy if she starts dating and could affect their friendship further. OP decided taking a step back was right for him. I think it\u2019s a respectable decision. \n\nI agree with what you\u2019re saying though cause OP did make it sound like an ultimatum. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to like me back then we can\u2019t be close friends\u201d. When it should\u2019ve been \u201cI respect your feelings and decision to not date but for my own health and sanity (or whatever) I need to take a step back from this friendship to avoid taking any of my hurt or jealousy or maybe even resentment out on you\u201d", "I didn\u2019t mean she owes me a relationship but for being \u2018just friends\u2019 and talking and hanging out every waking hour with someone who doesn\u2019t want me back is not a reasonable expectation imo after I made my intentions clear already.\n\nI am trying to justify someone wanting to spend this much time with me and wanting to talk to me for unreasonable amounts of hours so frequently by thinking this is probably what normal bestfriends would do but i promise you i feel like it has crossed that boundary. There are times we just sit in silence for hours and do nothing, we aren\u2019t sexually intimate but there has been a lot of touching and holding each other (not cuddling).\n\nI don\u2019t know where the line is but if she had a bf, i can guarantee this would not be okay with him.", "From the way this reads, He wasn't pretending to get in her pants.\nHe was her genuine friend, and feelings developed.\nThere was no pretending involved.\nHis feelings developed from platonic to romantic, hers didn't, so he's guarding his heart and withdrawing to prevent any further pain.\nThe fact that you jumped to the conclusion that he was just pretending to be her friend in the intrest of eventually having sex, is very telling.", "Yes exactly. I don\u2019t think the decision is wrong. This situation is really hard on both sides. For him, he\u2019s got to deal with the pain of unrequited feelings and she is losing a best friend over something that\u2019s not her fault. \n\nI just think the whole thing could have been communicated more maturely and I wonder if it\u2019s actually true that she doesn\u2019t treat him well or if it\u2019s just because he\u2019s hurt that he sees it that way.", "This is just semantics. The basic point of him needing to take a step back for his own mental health is communicated either way. The friend just wants to maintain the status quo because it suits her.", "Your last sentence said it all. \n\nNeither of you are arseholes here. You just want different things. \n\nMove on now before she gets a boyfriend and ditches you anyway.", ">I am trying to justify someone wanting to spend this much time with me and wanting to talk to me for unreasonable amounts of hours so frequently by thinking this is probably what normal bestfriends would do but i promise you i feel like it has crossed that boundary\n\nI can understand why you feel that way, and if I were in your situation, I'd have chosen to end the friendship too. She's the one who suggested all or nothing, and you went for the nothing option, which is probably for the best.", "> this is probably what normal bestfriends would do\n\nAs someone who has had both male and female best friends since childhood, the answer is no, lol. No, they do not. What you\u2019re describing sounds like an extreme form of obsessively codependent behavior, not friendship. On top of that, this girl sounds extremely selfish for monopolizing your time 24/7 \u2014 who calls someone for 4-5 hrs at 1AM?! What on earth could she have to talk about for that long?!?", "Yes thank you. I think that\u2019s part of why she might be mad is if he worded it like an ultimatum she might feel punished for not liking him. But he\u2019s doing the healthy thing regardless.", ">She's the one who suggested all or nothing\n\nWhich is weird, because 'all' was never on the table."]}
