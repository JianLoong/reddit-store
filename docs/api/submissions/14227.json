She didn't want to live alone and for money reasons. These past 5 years have been awful. My mom doesn't like my husband(M41) and she let's him know. She'd make dismissive comments, cook for everyone and leave nothing for him, badmouth him with neighbors and family...The relationship between my husband and myself is not perfect at all, but when it comes to my mom, he is polite and doesn't pay attention to the things she does. He says we should honor our parents no matter what.\n\nMy mom is not great either with the kids, my husband and I work full time so she stays home with them. I know she's no longer 20, I've offered her multiple times to hire someone to help her out with the kids, someone who would also clean, but she refuses. She doesn't trust anyone. She asked me to pay her to babysit instead of hiring someone, so that's what I do. But, she is not attentive to the kids, last month alone, she made them skip 3 meals because she \"didn't think they were hungry\". I arrived home after work and the kids hadn't had lunch. I'm not a patient person. We always fight about those issues, we yell at each other and my husband mediates.\n\nThings got worse 2years ago when my husband and I converted to a faith different than hers. My mom's very religious, she thinks she's the only one who holds the truth. When I'm home, she plays videos at a very high volume, with sermons she thinks apply to me. She believes I'll change my \"erroneous ways\" if I hear a religious old man screaming on youtube. I asked her though, multiple times, not to talk religion to the kids, I want them to make their own choice when they grow up. The conflict started cause I found out through my daughter that she's been endoctrinating the kids into her religion for months. She told my 8yo daughter that I had a demon in me and that I couldn't be trusted. My daughter told me that my mom prays for them to be punished by God cause punishment means love and that my daughter should not tell me any of this cause I'd kick my mom out of the house. She told my 8yo that if I do kick her out, it would be her fault. My daughter was conflicted, she loves her grandma but she also loves me and didn't understand what was happening.\n\nWhen I found out 2 weeks ago, I lost it, I called my husband and he was furious too. It was the first time I saw him that angry at her. We talked calmly to her though and asked her to leave. I told her to ask her church for a housing solution, that I didn't want her in my home.\n\nBut now, the anger has passed and I feel horrible, she's 73 after all, it feels like I'm abandoning her during her old days, when she needs me the most. She does not have any source of revenu, I pay for everything she needs. But she's still convinced that she's right, that I have demons and that she did the right thing. she's leaving next week God knows where and I feel like a piece of sh't.

You let this situation go on where she repeated that behavior multiple times and then were *surprised* when she started attempting active parental alienation?\n\nESH. Your mom sucks FAR more, but you and your husband are bad at drawing boundaries and bad at protecting your kids.

It's probably one of the hardest things you've done, but please know that she had more than sufficient time and notice from you to change her actions. She refused, and your escalation is perfectly reasonable.", "Let me say this kindly. Your mom reaped the consequences of her behavior. She knew she was wrong so she tried to get your daughter to hide It from you. She is using your children as a weapon. Your mom is a mass manipulator. If you\u2019re not going to protect yourself, do It for your kids. Kick her out.

She is clearly in the wrong but kicking out mother who is 73 and has nowhere to go is not easy. The problem is that she still think she is right and will not change. At this stage it is very toxic environment for your kids and you need to look after them. At the end of the day your mother has a choice: become at least civil in your household or leave. Your kids do not have that choice.  There is no good choices in your situation. You are choosing the least bad.  Unfortunately it is your mother who put you in this situation.", "NTA\n\nI will say it until I'm blue in the face.

It doesn't matter how old she is, in the first place you need to protect your family. I understand that you feel conflicted, but you did nothing wrong.", "Nta.

She is solely responsible for herself.\n\nUsing religion to threaten or attack others is a classic toxic move. My egg donor called me an evil spiritless child because I refuse to entertain her toxicity. Your mother feeding that nonsense to your daughter is wrong and will only bring her more confusion. Sure Christians are taught to honor their father and mother, but I\u2019m almost positive that God doesn\u2019t want you to honor toxicity.

I can understand feeling obligated to your mom but you need to protect your family. She has a church she can go to for resources and most countries have some kind of social security income for seniors.", "ESH. You for leaving your kids with this lady, although you know she sucks with kids and grandma sucks for pretty much everything", "NTA. That is a lot to have to put up with. Not only is she going against your wishes regarding the religion, you say she had times where she didn\u2019t feed the kids AND she\u2019s not attentive to them. If the roles were reversed and it was her house, do you think she would have remorse if she kicked you and your family out? It sucks, but she overstepped your boundaries and is dealing with the consequences.", "She an abusive, self centered manipulative woman, and the fact that you\u2019ve e let her abuse your family so long is tragic, get rid of her, tell her she\u2019s not welcome, and to no contact you are your children.

Did she not have a house she sold or retirement? \n\nIs this the USA, does she get social security? \n\nBefore she moved in, did you set ground rules? \n\nWhy are you letting your mother dictate who watches your kids? They have day care and after school programs you could put them in.\n\nAre there no other family members that could take her in? \n\nYour mom sounds very hard to deal with.
