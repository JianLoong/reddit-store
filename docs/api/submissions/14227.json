She didn't want to live alone and for money reasons. These past 5 years have been awful. My mom doesn't like my husband(M41) and she let's him know. She'd make dismissive comments, cook for everyone and leave nothing for him, badmouth him with neighbors and family...The relationship between my husband and myself is not perfect at all, but when it comes to my mom, he is polite and doesn't pay attention to the things she does. He says we should honor our parents no matter what.\n\nMy mom is not great either with the kids, my husband and I work full time so she stays home with them. I know she's no longer 20, I've offered her multiple times to hire someone to help her out with the kids, someone who would also clean, but she refuses. She doesn't trust anyone. She asked me to pay her to babysit instead of hiring someone, so that's what I do. But, she is not attentive to the kids, last month alone, she made them skip 3 meals because she \"didn't think they were hungry\". I arrived home after work and the kids hadn't had lunch. I'm not a patient person. We always fight about those issues, we yell at each other and my husband mediates.\n\nThings got worse 2years ago when my husband and I converted to a faith different than hers. My mom's very religious, she thinks she's the only one who holds the truth. When I'm home, she plays videos at a very high volume, with sermons she thinks apply to me. She believes I'll change my \"erroneous ways\" if I hear a religious old man screaming on youtube. I asked her though, multiple times, not to talk religion to the kids, I want them to make their own choice when they grow up. The conflict started cause I found out through my daughter that she's been endoctrinating the kids into her religion for months. She told my 8yo daughter that I had a demon in me and that I couldn't be trusted. My daughter told me that my mom prays for them to be punished by God cause punishment means love and that my daughter should not tell me any of this cause I'd kick my mom out of the house. She told my 8yo that if I do kick her out, it would be her fault. My daughter was conflicted, she loves her grandma but she also loves me and didn't understand what was happening.\n\nWhen I found out 2 weeks ago, I lost it, I called my husband and he was furious too. It was the first time I saw him that angry at her. We talked calmly to her though and asked her to leave. I told her to ask her church for a housing solution, that I didn't want her in my home.\n\nBut now, the anger has passed and I feel horrible, she's 73 after all, it feels like I'm abandoning her during her old days, when she needs me the most. She does not have any source of revenu, I pay for everything she needs. But she's still convinced that she's right, that I have demons and that she did the right thing. she's leaving next week God knows where and I feel like a piece of sh't.

She's terrible.", "Your mother is abusive to your children.\nYour mother is abusive to your husband.\nAllowing access to your children and husband to continue to be abused by her would make you an asshole.\n\nNTA to have her live elsewhere. She might have dementia which could explain but does not excuse her abusive behaviour.", "NTA! I feel religion is always a tricky business in families, although I've been lucky it's never caused many problems with me, but they are YOUR children, you told her first and foremost that you didn't want them being swayed towards her faith and to let them choose for themselves, she blatantly showed you disrespect by completely disregarding your request! \n\nYour mother should always be someone you can confide in, but she's seemingly been more of a tension point in the house to the degree of frightening your children! I'm not saying there was anything you could have done beforehand, but I personally think that you've saved your children from being insecure and scared in their own home! So I say! Good on you!", "\"Thoughts & Prayers!\"  Let the other cult members take care of her.   Mom doesn't want to live with a Demon, so no guilt there.", "Yta for forcing your husband and kids to suffer at her hands for years, really as simple as that", "Your kids think she loves them\u2026 she was abusive and told your daughter to keep secrets\u2026 don\u2019t ever let her back into your home or your life and all of you need therapy especially your kids. They need to know what she did wasn\u2019t love\u2026", "YTA for allowing your family to be accused by her for so long.", "No. They don't need to find her alternate housing. Let the abusive woman find her own housing. Let that be her comeuppance. That and never seeing her grandkids again ..", "While I didn't have her in my house, my mother was kind of like this--although she told my kids they had demons in *them.*  NTA for kicking her out now.  Don't look back--if you want to \"honor your mother\" make sure she is being taken care of properly, don't be responsible for doing it yourself.  Trust me,  your mental health will be so much better if she's out of your life as much as possible.", "Absolutely do not let your mother near your kids again. Don\u2019t be alone with her. \nAfter she\u2019s moved out, if anyone from the church shows up at your house (with or without your mother) do not, under any circumstances, let them in. Or even open the door to them. Be prepared to call the police.", "Abusers and child predators come in all forms and they're most easily identified when they tell children to keep their secrets \"or else\". Your mom was hurting your children in many ways and your love for her blinded you to that abuse- and yes it is abuse to starve children and force them to keep secrets the adults *know* are bad to keep. Your mom knew what she was doing was bad and she still did it. You need to put your kids first. Them witnessing your mother straight up disrespect their parents is teaching them that you aren't to be respected. \n\nKick her out and keep her out.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. She sounds toxic and not good for a marriage or your children. She is abusive and she raised you to take more than you should. She crossed many lines. She also sounds incompetent to babysit at this point. Let her church help her.", "Has your mom always been like this or has her behavior changed drastically? \n\nI say this, because I feel like some of what you are describing mirrors my grandparents Alzheimer\u2019s history. Forgetting to feed your children & then making up a completely unreasonable story. Not wanting help, because they don\u2019t want anyone close to them all day to see the symptoms. Even the religious stance, the demon comment felt like deja vu.\n\nYou are definitely NTA. But maybe if your mom hasn\u2019t had a medical check up recently, or if she changed medication she was taking, take a look at that. \nHope everything works out for the best for your family.", "NTA she has disrespected you, your husband, and is neglecting your children when she isn't causing religious trauma. She needed ro be out years ago.", "You let this go on for 5 years and now you feel bad for her age? Why didn\u2019t you feel bad for your family who she was treating badly?", "YTA for the pain your family went through. You knew you should have removed your mother and you did t. \nNow. NTA because you finally kicked her out. Too bad it took her hurting your children emotionally and physically.", "I\u2019m going to reply a little kinder to this comment as the daughter of a very narcissistic, abusive mother. It\u2019s hard to get out of the relationship, your mom has developed a whole lifetime of relationship based on abusing you and then making you feel like the one who is wrong, cruel, and guilty. You are NOT wrong, cruel, nor guilty - SHE is. You need to cut ties and get therapy for yourself and your family, you and your husband, your kids, have all suffered abuse; you need support now. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re hitting your breaking point (seeing the kids harmed will often do this), but you\u2019ve been harmed in the same way too. You OWE YOUR MOM nothing - she held you hostage - go be free, get healthy, get help, get away\u2026", "YTA for letting your children be cared for by this woman for FIVE YEARS.  She didn't feed them.  What the fuck?\n\nDo you have any idea how much shit she probably told them about their father?  And that doesn't even get into the religious stuff.  Guarantee you she's told them that you're going to burn in hell.", "ESH. You're not an asshole for kicking her out. You're an asshole for not kicking her out sooner, like when you found out she repeatedly deprived your kids of food. Yelling at her about it wasn't enough. She was abusing them. She was also abusive to your husband too."]}
