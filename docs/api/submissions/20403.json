A couple of weeks ago, my mom told me that my sister (25) and her boyfriend were coming in to visit for a few days. My sister, we\u2019ll call her Jay. Jay is very difficult to be around and semi narcissistic. Jay lives several states away and visits home whenever she can afford a flight, but I tend to visit often for little day trips as it\u2019s only a 3 hour drive. Mom has been dying for all her kids to be together (sisters 20 f and 18 f also) because we don\u2019t get to anymore with everyone living far apart. I said cool, and agreed that my boyfriend (24 m) and I would love to come for the weekend. \n\nSo fast forward to last night, and my little sisters and my mom are texting me saying they\u2019re so excited for \u201call of us to get together and finally have a talk\u201d. Um, what? Apparently Jay has been telling them that she still is very upset over how I hurt her almost TWO YEARS AGO with the graduation fiasco detailed in my last post a year ago. Mom called, said she was happy that Jay and I would finally get to air our grievances. I\u2019m literally baffled, because not only did we already have a conversation about this a year and a half ago where we agreed to disagree, but we\u2019ve spoken several times since then and seen each other without this ever being brought up. \n\nSo Jay has been telling everyone in my family for the past year and a half that it \u201churts to be around me\u201d and that she wanted to take this weekend to finally tell me how she feels. My mom said that they wanted me to come visit by myself, so we could have intimate family time. Mind you, my bf and I have been together for almost 5 years so he is very much a part of the family. I just feel like everyone has planned this elaborate plot to get me by myself so that Jay can rehash details of a situation long over and done with that she never got over. \n\nI have pretty bad anxiety but have been doing pretty okay with that recently. But the fact that my entire family has essentially planned something for me to cater to Jay and her feelings without really including me in the planning makes me extremely uncomfortable. I thought this was just going to be a regular dinner and hang out like it always is, until yesterday when my mom spilled the details. I essentially said I didn\u2019t want go because of this and now everyone is upset.

This is a boundary that I am setting for myself and ask that you all respect that. \n\nYour sister took your big day and made it about her, I hope as sisters you guys can move on, but that does not mean you need to keep talking about it 2 years later.

I would either drive before and talk to your mom, or if all else, call her. Tell her that you are not going to participate in this drama another day.

I invited her, she left me with I\u2019m not sure, though you invited her months prior, she waited until the week before to finally tell you that she was coming. Also point out the many times she has flaked out on events. That you had four tickets, and hers was there waiting until you gave up waiting for a response. So you gave it to your BF who has been by your side throughout your schooling and has been your primary support through it all. He should have been first choice, but you offered it to her instead and she blew you off.\n\nNow, that I know that she is still having a whine fest STILL, that you are not going to participate another day to have her play victim to something she created.

Meanwhile, my bf and I are going to go somewhere that is drama free. And who knows, maybe elope drama free.
