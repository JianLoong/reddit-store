{"id": 3057, "submission_id": "z2qa5r", "title": "AITA for want to change to a phone plan that will cost my sister $10-15 more a month but my husband and I a lot less?", "selftext": "Several years ago my husband and I got a bundle deal for cell phones, internet, and tv. We eventually dropped the tv because we didn\u2019t use it. Then last year we moved and didn\u2019t need the internet portion anymore either, so dropped that as well. Now it is just the bill for cell phones. \n\nAlso several years ago my sister was going through a separation/divorce and hard money times. To save her money my husband and I decided to add her to our phone plan. The way it was set up we pay $120 (plus tax/fees) for the plan, and then $20 a line. Plus of course if any line has insurance or a phone payment that costs extra. It was a good deal way back in the day since it was unlimited and all. We only ever charge my sister the price of her line (about $25) and the price of her phone payment. Which at the time they had buy one get one free so me and her did that and split the cost of the bought phone, which has since been paid off. \n\nSo for several years now my husband has paid $90.50 plus his insurance and phone payment when he had it. I paid $115.50 (I pay for a line for my grandma) and my half of the phone payment. And my sister paid $25 plus a half phone payment till it was paid off. We never complained or asked her to pay more.\n\nWell now we need new phones (especially my grandma) and there\u2019s better phone deals out there. There\u2019s a new plan where you pay per line and each line chooses which level works for them ($50,$40,$35) plus a deal where you can get a new phone for $5. So while my sisters bill would go up $15 ish dollars, my husbands would drop $35 ish and mine would drop $25 and we\u2019d save money overall.\n\nMy sister is in a better spot now, she\u2019s remarried. They have a two income household (though he doesn\u2019t make as much as he can and they put wants above need a lot). But none the less I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s terrible to ask her to finally pay more towards her part so we can finally save some. However she kind of freaked out when I brought it up. So Aita? \n\nTLDR: we paid a lot more for years so she didn\u2019t have to. Is it so bad to ask her to pay a bit more now?\n\nEdit to add more information cause I didn\u2019t think about people saying to do it without her: we can\u2019t do this deal if I drop her (it\u2019s a 4 like minimum) but that\u2019s ok we can find something else. She started to talk about switching to my parents plan and I was like ok just let me know soon so we (husband and I) can figure out what to do before the phone deal runs out. Then she got upset saying that why can\u2019t we switch to my parents plan when we talked about it in the past. I said that I never said we can\u2019t, my husband and I just need to talk about what we want to do. And that she\u2019s free to do what she wants, I just need to know asap what that is;", "created_utc": 1669213060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2qa5r/aita_for_want_to_change_to_a_phone_plan_that_will/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Too much info gives people room to argue and strut around calling you an a h because they don't want to change.
