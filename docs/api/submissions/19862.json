If you have a newborn, I\u2019m guessing your wife is worn out, agreed to the plan when you said it, and later reconsidered.\n\nYour wife is maybe an asshole for demanding to see your group chat and saying she\u2019s gonna go to her cousin\u201ds instead, but I\u2019d need more info since that\u2019s a strong reaction.\n\nI suspect there is more to the story.", "INFO: How 'new' is your newborn, and what does your house look like right now? There are multiple factors that could be at play here. Maybe she's still recovering from the birth, maybe she's exhausted and now worried about entertaining people (even if you don't really have that expectation), maybe she's worried about your dad and brother seeing the place and stressed that now she feels like she has to clean everything before they come over. If your brother hasn't met the baby yet it sounds like y'all are still in the early weeks, and dropping surprise guests on her is freaking her out.", "I'm going with ESH, you should have run the idea by her BEFORE you agreed and she seems like she is overreacting.  There is probably more to this story if y'all are talking about ending things over this... so figure out what is wrong.", "I've got a few thoughts here, and I want to start out by saying NAH.\n\nBut I see your wife's side. Yes, it was an extreme reaction on her part, busy post partum is extremely hard. Especially in the first 3 months. Especially with other kids in the home. If she was under the impression that a nice chill day would be happening, then all of a sudden that's changed, she might be now taking on an even larger mental load - are the dishes done? Does the house look ok? Will I need to feed guests? Do we have drinks for them? How's the bathroom look? I need clean clothes. Kids need clean clothes. Baby needs to be on a good feeding and sleeping schedule for that day so I can sleep that night. What if baby is up all night? What if baby just wants to eat the whole time they're here? Etc etc etc.\n\nIt's not just having guests. It's everything that goes along with that. Especially if there isn't enough time to get everything ready and prepared for guests. If she's breastfeeding, now she's got to worry about extra people being around.\n\nAnd if all of this is out of character for her - she's very likely sleep deprived, or has some post partum depression or anxiety going on. Which is normal, though it can be serious.\n\nI understand you wanting to spend time with your dad and brother! You should be able to do that and have them over. But, you also need to communicate with your wife, and have a conversation about what needs to happen before they come over.\n\nAnd for everyone saying it would be harder for her to take the kids elsewhere rather than stay - maybe her cousin would be more attentive to the kids rather than OP visiting with his dad and brother (not saying this is true, just putting it out there). Maybe her cousin wouldn't care if everyone showed up in PJs and OPs wife was on day 3/4/5 of no shower. Maybe her cousin doesn't care if OP needs to take a boob out, and OPs wife is comfortable with her cousin seeing her boob (if breastfeeding).\n\nIn the end - I hope you have a good father's day, and have a day you enjoy. But I also hope it's not at the expense of causing your partner undo stress and hardship while she is still recovering from birth.\n\n(I say this as someone who every father's day for the last 3 years has gone to my in-laws so my partner can be with his family on Father's Day, and enjoy time with his kids, siblings, and dad - and who gets the mother's day I want. But we talk about it and make plans together)", "NTA.\n\nThis is your day and she is being ridiculous. If she had invited her sister and mom to come over on Mother's Day, would it be reasonable for you to blow up and take the kid to your cousin's? Of course not.\n\nIn all honesty, staying at home hanging out with the family isn't much of a plan and it isn't impacted by having two more family members in attendance, for part of the time. Also this is your Dad, who is also hanging out with his children (and grandchild) on Father's day.\n\nYou didn't do a damn thing wrong.", "ESH. You should be allowed to hang with the other fathers in your life, but you made an important decision regarding your home and infringing on previously made plans without consulting with your SO. Maybe your SO has a surprise for you that didn\u2019t include others being around? Yeah, it\u2019s a day for fathers, but maybe communicate a little more before deciding for the entire household what will happen.", "INFO: How old is your baby?\n\nI am inclined to say YTA because you say newborn and your brother has not met them yet. That leads me to believe that you baby is maybe a month old max. Which means your wife is still recovering from childbirth. She should not be volunteered to host a family event right now. I get that it is fathers day, but now is not the time for you to be hosting family holiday gatherings.", "Info. Yes it's father's day, so it should make sense that you would want to spend time with your own father as well... However you should of ran the plans with her beforehand. It may be your day, but you already had plans with her so she was expecting just you and the kid. If plans change then talk to her first before confirming it with the other party. \n\nI don't think she is TA, maybe over-reacted a bit, but not the TA from what you are telling me. What is her side of the story? Why was she fine at first but then got upset? Why are guys talking about ending things? What are you guys fighting about? These are the questions we need to know to make such a decision.", "ESH It is Father's Day, so you should be allowed to do what you want but if your baby is a newborn, you probably should have talked to her first. The house is probably a mess and she's probably extremly hormonal. \n\nNew babies are so hard.", "YTA, you two made plans together, then you changed the plans without consulting her. You should have asked her before you agreed", "ESH You\u2019re in a relationship. Talk with each other before changing (no matter how laid-back) plans, and never invite someone over w/o talking to each other first. Yes, it\u2019s Fathers Day but you have a newborn. She may not be up to hosting people last minute. She may have seen it as a relaxing day and now she has to clean the house, get snacks and drinks, shower. I don\u2019t know; ask her.", "ESH - there\u2019s something called communication, both of you seem bad at it.", "INFO: who would entertain the guest for the three hours", "Yta you made plans FOR your wife, without talking to her", "NTA \n\nMust be more bs going on if this is going to end things", "Info- does this estimated 3 hours or so get together create more work for her? The previous plan was just you all and the kids, now two people are coming over on a day that is supposed honor dads and let them chill. \n\nDid you just add a lot to her expected workload with this unexpected hosting of your dad and brother?  Additional cleaning, possible food serving as they will be there at lunch time? If so, that could be why she is annoyed.\n\nETA: it does seem pretty odd that there were no prior plans to even see your dad on Father's Day since it sounds like he's local to you. I can't imagine not having my dad over for Father's Day.", "Okay I'm saying YTA because while yes it's your day,  some confirmation and communication is kinda important especially with a baby and multiple children. Like would it have killed you to talk with her about it? \"It's my day so I get to make any plans I think fit with zero regard to anyone else.\" That sounds like an AH move.", "NTA. I think it was a reasonable error on your part, one you could stand to learn from and more to the point one that can be corrected without much difficulty. Your SO's reaction seems extreme and I would say venomous.", "YTA. You went from spending time with your wife and kids, including new baby, to making your wife host a party for your dad and brother. Sounds like she\u2019s taking the kids somewhere she can get support and leaving you to spend the day with your dad and brother like you want. Have fun.", "Maybe just a slight YTA. Like, yeah, you should get to do the day how you want, but at the same time you previously made plans with her and she was excited for them. Since she was wh you planned with first, you should have at least told her you were wanting to change things and asked what she thought before setting it in stone that you were going to make changes. It's inconsiderate, even if it's small.\n\nI don't understand the strength of her reaction, but can't really judge that as there is absolutely context we're missing there.", "NTA. It\u2019s Fathers Day. Like, you\u2019re a father, your father is a father\u2026kinda makes sense you would enjoy chilling and hanging with your father. And your bro gets to meet the baby.

Your SO's reaction was completely uncalled for and she appears to be attempting to punish you for something you didn't do. You reached out of your own initiative to try to spend some time with your father and brother on Father's Day, and you did not think it was unreasonable since you would still be able to spend the evening with your family. It appears that your SO was not happy with your plans and is trying to take it out on you. You have done nothing wrong and should not be blamed for wanting to include your family in your Father's Day plans.", "FFS your wife doesn\u2019t want your DAD to come over on Father\u2019s Day to meet his new grandchild? You\u2019re not the AH OP, your wife is. Also, the plans she made? I really didn\u2019t see a lot of plans. You do live there? You could hang out on many other days.

This is Father's Day celebrating fatherhood. She didn't plan anything crazy. They are sitting at home and then having dinner.\n\nThat's more like a low-effort to no plan at all. Him inviting his brother and dad to stop by is perfectly reasonable and well within his rights.", "Exactly!", "Listen, I hear you totally, but when one party makes plans (no matter how \"lame\" or \"simple\" they may be) it is appropriate for the other party to run a change of plans by the other; it is simple manners.  In this case, the wife made plans for Father's Day and the father added a layer to the plan.  When you have a partner, it is polite to ask them before you change plans you had previously agreed to (which he did).  I'd say the same thing if things were reversed.   But there is clearly a deeper issue if she is now talking separation, what that issue is and the veracity of it is still on question.", "While it is \u201chis day,\u201d it\u2019s also a day for his kids to celebrate him, and spend quality time together. This means being present with the kids, which is not likely given that he\u2019s now hosting. I know I would be annoyed if my partner suddenly changed the plans, esp with the expectation of cleaning the house and playing host", "That actually makes perfect sense if she is recovering. She goes somewhere where she does not need to play the host and where she can probably relax. Same as if she were to go to a parent or siblings house. Regardless, that is a very strange thing to base her recovery progress on.", ">Why do her expectations matter more than his on Father's Day?\n\nI didn't say her expectations matter more than his on Father's day, i'm saying that he should of ran the idea past her first before inviting others into the house, that is the point of living together in a relationship, it's called communication. He didn't communicate with his partner and so that is what made her upset. I don't know your personality, how old you are, or your past relationship history... However if you are fine with your partner telling you last minute (in this case 2 days before it's gonna happen) that their family is coming over without consulting you while taking care of kids AND a newbown, then I can understand why you would agree with his behavior.  \n\n\n>They didn't have plans. They weren't doing anything but making dinner together. Objectively, how was this any different than any other Sunday?  \nHaving his Dad and brother over made his Father's Day better. She didn't plan anything other than saying there were no plans.\n\nActually they did make plans, according to the OP himself  \"made plans for father's day where we would spend the day with the kids including our newborn son. The idea was to chill at home with the family and then we would make a nice dinner together at the end of the day.\" \n\nThat is the problem, you can't look at this objectively. We are missing so much info, which is why I put \"INFO\" instead of \"YTA, NAH, or ESH\". Do they both work, if so, then what are their days off? If she isn't working then does she have to look after the kids and a newborn all day? Does he help around with cleaning and kids? How much quality time do they spend together without the kids present? Does he have a habit of inviting family and friends over before talking to her? How old is the newborn? Is she the main person getting up when the newborn cries? Also, how many kids in total do they have? Does she get help while the husband is at work? How long will   \n\n\nWe have so many factors to consider here, so I can't judge their actions because it involves not just him, it involves the family as a whole. Do you know how hard it is to take care of multiple kids plus a newborn? Planning an event takes time, consideration, and money. Unless something happens that is unexpected, then you have no choice to oblige, however that isn't the case here. Since we don't know what their home life is like, we don't know what a \"Typical Sunday\" is for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Does it seem reasonable that she would abscond with the kid on Father's Day in response? If she has the energy to spend all day at her cousins house, she can tolerate OP's father and brother for a few hours.  \nShit, she could have put more effort into celebrating OP's fatherhood in the first place.\n\nNo it doesn't seem reasonable, but it doesn't make her TA, which is why I said she maybe over-reacted a bit. It's not about tolerating the father and brother, it's about OP being inconsiderate. The brother wanted to get together with OP and their father, which is understandable, I get it. However, OP suggested his house, who he shares with his partner and kids. I just can't make a decision unless I get this info, if you disagree with me then you are free to. Like I said I don't know your personality, age, or your relationship history, hell I don't even know if you have kids or not. If you are in your 30's, with kids and a newborn, living with a partner, and make plans without consulting your partner first and they are ok with that, then I can understand why you would think it's ok for him to do this.", "If she's suddenly having to clean the whole house to the guests' expectations, cook, and play host, that's hardly no effort. Especially recovering from giving birth.", "She didn't make any plans other than the fact that they wouldn't be doing anything. \n\nIf she has the energy to take the little one to her cousin's all day, as punishment for inviting his brother and father over, then she has enough energy to actually have made a better effort on Father's Day.\n\nHe invited his brother and father over because he wanted to. He wanted to share some of the day with these two because it made him happy on his first Father's Day.\n\nHe told her that he invited them and these invitations didn't conflict with her no plan at all.\n\nBut again, this is his day.", "Sure, it does. That's way easier than having your bil and fil over for 3 hours.", "So, if he made no Mother's Day plans for his wife, other than hanging at home and making dinner together, and she invited her mom and sister over, would it be reasonable to object\n\nWould it be reasonable to take the kid to his cousin's so she couldn't spend time with her child on Mother's Day?\n\nThis is all crazy to me.", "Hosting is not just having people over. It is making sure the house is clean. It is making sure that herself and the baby are presentable. It probably also includes feeding them.", "You are still saying that they didn't make any plans on father's day, which I pointed out isn't the case. If she did the same thing, I would say the same thing. Again, communication is key in a relationship, which he did not do.\n\nIf you don't have children, live with a partner, and have a full time job at the same time I can understand that this is a crazy concept for you. By your history it looks like you are stuck on the \"if she can take her kids to her cousins, why can't she tolerate the dad and brother?\". Let me explain it to you since by the way you talk, you don't have any experience with raising multiple kids along with newborns through my own experiences, from a woman's perspective.\n\nHaving a partner that works, while you are home taking care of kids and a newborn is exhausting. From dealing with the changes in your body from carrying the newborn, the trauma on your body from child birth, and the sleep deprivation you get the first 3 months of the birth is no joke. 2 days heads up is just insulting for a new mother, especially when it comes to entertaining guests. There are so many variables to consider when inviting people over, which is why I say that communication is key. It's not about tolerating the in laws, it's about respect. Which in this case, he didn't respect her by communicating with her, so why should she respect him? Is it AH worthy? I don't know. Would I do it myself? No, personally I wouldn't. I would let my partner know that it is alright, however I would tell him that we have to have a \"talk\" after the in-laws leave.\n\nWe don't know their family dynamic so we don't know, nor can we judge OP or his partner until we do. As it is now, from what we are going on, no matter what she does, she would get the short end of the stick. If she complies then she isn't going to have a good time due to her recovery. If she goes with just the newborn while leaving the kids at home, he would complain that he wanted his family to meet the newborn. If she just goes to her cousin's without the kids (which probably wouldn't happen because separation anxiety not having your newborn is real, especially if she is the main caretaker of the newborn) then she is abandoning the kids due to her pettiness.\n\nNow on the flip side, is it wrong for OP to want to spend time with his brother and father ON father's day? No. In fact the brother asked if they can get together, in OP's eyes, since he was gonna spend time with his kids and partner at home, why not have them join in! It would make a wonderful day to spend time with family, kids, and partner! Any person would make this logical assessment. It's just that he didn't tell her before making these plans is the problem. I can't tell if it's NTA, NAH, or ESH because I need more information.\n\nIf anything it's a *soft* ESH if I had to choose with the information i'm going on from OP.", "Stop it. \n\nThis was his dad and brother on father's day. Nobody was expecting canap\u00e9s.", "Reread what I wrote and answer that.", "ESH - I\u2019m a big fan of whoever\u2019s day it is, mothers/fathers/birthdays, that person gets to call the shots. It\u2019s Father\u2019s Day, you should have majority voting power. \n\nHere is where you are the AH. You agreed to a low key plan with your post-birth wife to spend the whole day together bonding with your new baby. That was communicated and was the plan. You decided to make other plans without communicating this with your hormonal sleep deprived wife who just pushed or was cut open and retrieved a whole ass human baby from her body. There is a lot of pressure to host other people in your home when you are recovering from this. It\u2019s a special day so she feels the pressure of extra work in preparing the house and hosting them for a big part of the day.

Divorcing parents typically share custody until the court makes a final ruling on child custody.
