We've been chatting everyday and we've had a few dates together. We're officially dating. But my best friend, Alexis(F29), is being an absolute bitch about it. We used to spend a lot of time together and we would play games together. But since we live in different states, I don't see her physically. Sure, I spend a little less time with her now because I'm dating but I still try. I am aware that I canceled plans with her once or twice because my boyfriend had surprise plans for me. \n\nBut I just asked her to play a game with me later today since I'm bored and my boyfriend is busy. Alexis got bitchy and said no to my invitation because \"I don't like competing for your attention\" and she insists that I won't actually show up for our gaming session. She'd rather prioritize her time by going solo instead od spending time with an asshole.", "created_utc": 1688349288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14p5ql2/aita_for_trying_to_date_someone/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I could see why she would be a bit miffed.", "YTA - you are overtly acting like you only want to hang out with her as a backup plan when your boyfriend isn\u2019t free.", "YTA. You cancel plans when you get a better offer. You only contacted her because you were bored and your bf wasn't available.", ">I canceled plans with her once or twice\n\nINFO: How close together were these cancellations?", "Idk... You're calling your friend a bitch it doesn't sound like you have a lot of love for her. I think you could've made her feel heard because last minute plans changing is very annoying and isolating and if things don't work out with this guy you'd probably expect her to support you. It sounds like she's much better at communicating than you are.", "YTA for using your friend as a back up plan. I would have said  N T A or maybe E S H but cancelling plans and asking your friend to do something with you because you are bored and your boyfriend is busy, well that's asshole behavior.\n\n>I am aware that I canceled plans with her once or twice because my boyfriend had surprise plans for me. \n\n>But I just asked her to play a game with me later today since I'm bored and my boyfriend is busy.", "You are not the AH for \u201ctrying to date someone.\u201d\n\nYTA for cancelling plans with her multiple times because you got a better offer from your new bf. She\u2019s clearly feeling neglected. Try harder.   \n\n\nThat means making plans with her not just because you\u2019re bored because your bf is busy.", "As someone who has been on the receiving end of something like this, it\u2019s really shitty when your friends no longer have time for you because they got boyfriends. She feels like you don\u2019t care about her anymore. YTA- put more effort into your friendship.", "YTA. Based on the post and your attitude toward your \u201cfriend\u201d", "YTA for cancelling plans, calling her a bitch for being upset about it, and then expecting her to be all happy when you reach out because you\u2019re bored.", "YTA. this reads like a middle schooler wrote it. you\u2019re being an awful friend and calling her a bitch because she didn\u2019t want to be jerked around is disgusting. do her a favour and let her go because she deserves better friends than an AH like you. you need to grow up because you continue to prove her point, you\u2019re a giant AH, and an entitled one at that.", "YTA for canceling plans and hitting her up because you were bored.", "YTA & one of those pathetic girls who loses themselves once they get into a relationship. \n\nPeople make time for what they want to make time for. Your friend probably felt like a last resort or consolation prize seeing as how you asked her because your bf was busy. \n\nHonestly girls like you are pathetic.", ">But I just asked her to play a game with me later today since I'm bored and my boyfriend is busy.\n\nSo you only want to play with her because you are bored and your boyfriend is busy. I mean, if I were your friend I wouldn't like it if you only come to me for these reasons. Doesn't mean you should neglect your friends just because you're in a relationship.\n\nYou also changed your mind for plans with her a few times in a close time frame.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\n\"But I just asked her to play a game with her because I'm bored and my bf is busy\" \n\nThat statement right there is all I need to know that you're only using Alexis as a backup plan. If you were actually her friend you would make time for her and not just want anything to do with her when you're bored.", "ESH\n\nLook, it's totally normal to spend less time with friends as you get into new relationship.\n\nBut cancelling plans for your new guy is shitty.", "ESH.  You got into a new relationship and took your friend for granted, cancelling plans at the last minute when your boyfriend is available and expecting her to be available when he's busy.   She is being childish in her response.", "ESH \n\nYou for cancelling plans. If you have cancelled plans multiple times you are not respecting her or her time.\n\nYour friend for trying to \"compete for your attention\" and not just talking about the issues head on.", "That\u2019s not much of a friend. NTA.", "NAH. This is the natural way life progresses. This period in most people\u2019s lives is focused on finding a partner for good reason. It is natural that a new relationship would absorb your time and attention. Your friend\u2018s reaction is not unusual; it is bit immature, but if she is not dating herself (or hasn\u2019t much) it\u2019s understandable that she feels rejected. I would try to set one or two times a week to spend time with her and make them inviolable. It will not do your relationship any harm if you\u2019re not always available to your bf for surprise plans. And while you may, in time, outgrow this friendship, you may not, and if she otherwise a good friend, she is worth hanging on to.", "Lol NTA", "NTA It sounds like your friend wants your world to revolve around them and if you want a serious relationship the reality is that while it's not a \"competition\" for time, they will likely have to give up a large piece of the pie to a serious relationship. Seems like they know that and rather than cheer for your happiness they are concerned for how this impacts them.", "YTA I had a friend like you once. We are not friends anymore", "YTA and also very immature. I had to double check the ages you put because this sounds like something a teenager would do. Grow up.", "YTA. It sounds like OP is 15 vice 30.", "YTA", "Ask yourself this\u2026\u2026if your boyfriend wasn\u2019t busy, would you still have asked her to hang out ? \n\nThere is a phrase we say \u201c mejor estar sola que mal acompa\u00f1ada \u201c \nBasically means \u201cit\u2019s better to be alone than in bad company\u201d and I think this can be applied here. \n\nYTA", "YTA. I had to double check the ages, because this sounds like high school drama. You've canceled plans with your 'friend' because of your boyfriend, and you only invite her to play games when you're bored and your boyfriend is busy? Yikes. You should know by now that friends are important and not just there to entertain you when you have nothing better to do. She's not a toy you can take off the shelf when you're bored, and ignore if you have better things to do. If you continue to treat your friend like this, you won't have a friend for much longer.", "I had to reread the ages. because this really reads like teenage stuff.", "Exactly my read. You were bored, Bf was busy, she was sloppy seconds. YTA. New relationships are challenging to navigate, because it\u2019s a new balance of commitments- so making a real and honest effort is necessary.\n\nYou just sound like a B.", "I don't see why I was wrong for asking her to hang out when I'm bored. That's literally what friends are for.", "My boyfriend and I started dating two months ago, it's expected we spend most of our time together", "That's not true. I did cancel once or twice but that was when ee literally made the plans on the day. I hadn't commutted to it 100%. Besides, my boyfriend's work si very busy. Most of the time, I can only chat with him on the phone or through text. \n\nAlexis is not as busy.", "I don't know. A week? A few days? They were plans we were discussing same day. I didn't commit 100$ to them and she understood when I canceled that it was because my boyfriend surprised me with a once in a lifetime experience. He literally took me to a barge for a concert.", "I wonder if boyfriends plans happen to be exactly when she has other plans on purpose.", "Based on OPs use of \u201cliterally\u201d & their idea of a once in a lifetime opportunity Im starting to think yea this may be a middle school student writing this.", "My boyfriend surprised me with a dinner reservation at a 4 star restaurant and a concert on a barge. She understood that was a once in a lifetime experience. I made sure she was ok with it before I went. \n\nIf she has feelings, she should have said so.", "Yeah I mean now that I am an adult I don\u2019t get to see my friends much so I totally cherish the cherish the times we can hangout and wouldn\u2019t ditch for my boyfriend. I can see him everyday lol.", "That literally isn\u2019t what friends are for. \n\nYTA and entitled.", "no its not, you clearly don\u2019t know what friendship is for so do her a favour and let her go, she deserves better friends. YTA x1000", "Wrong. Actual friends are people you make an effort to spend time with and value the time you spend with them. You make them a priority, not a back up because you have nothing better to do. You sound very selfish and like a crappy friend. I don\u2019t blame her at all for not wanting to game only because your new BF wasn\u2019t around.", "Because it reads like the only reason you are asking her to hangout is because you have nothing better to do. She doesn\u2019t feel like a last option. Yes when you enter a relationship you are bound to prioritize them and see friends less but you still don\u2019t ditch friends and act like they are chopped liver just because you have a bf. If you and the guy don\u2019t work out the friends will still be there. Unless you treat them badly when you have a boyfriend always.", "You\u2019re literally telling her that she\u2019s only worth your time and energy when your bf is busy\u2026 YTA, you can have friends and a bf-stop making your bf your only priority or you\u2019ll end up with no friends", "Friends are two way relationships, if you\u2019re cancelling on them on a whim but expect them to show up for you then your simply an entitled narcissist.", "That is a mistake.  It\u2019s really important not to neglect friends in favor of a guy.  Certainly it may mean you spend less time with your friend as the relationship grows, but unless it\u2019s some big event it\u2019s best to plan romantic dates around already scheduled friend dates.  I\u2019ve made that mistake.", "YTA- Things you didn\u2019t say to your very new boyfriend, but should have: \n\n\u201cHey Boyfriend! Super sweet you made plans for us, but I actually have plans with my best friend who I\u2019ve known longer than our relationship of two whole months. Hope you understand, and look forward to rescheduling with you!!\u201d", "Oh bro, YTA here for sure...", "Or, she's one of those people who neglects friendships when in a relationship and when it ends, calls the same friends crying and asking for their support and attention.", "As an aside, that isn\u2019t a once in a lifetime experience", "Or that , yes", "look at ops response, she thinks friends exist to fill space when the bf is busy. clearly she\u2019s the problem"]}
