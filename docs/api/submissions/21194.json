We've been chatting everyday and we've had a few dates together. We're officially dating. But my best friend, Alexis(F29), is being an absolute bitch about it. We used to spend a lot of time together and we would play games together. But since we live in different states, I don't see her physically. Sure, I spend a little less time with her now because I'm dating but I still try. I am aware that I canceled plans with her once or twice because my boyfriend had surprise plans for me. \n\nBut I just asked her to play a game with me later today since I'm bored and my boyfriend is busy. Alexis got bitchy and said no to my invitation because \"I don't like competing for your attention\" and she insists that I won't actually show up for our gaming session. She'd rather prioritize her time by going solo instead od spending time with an asshole.", "created_utc": 1688349288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14p5ql2/aita_for_trying_to_date_someone/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People are generally understanding of that, so long as its reasonable and not all the time. \n\nI think the problem is just your attitude about it. Your friendship could mean a lot to her, and I could see why she would be upset if you're blowing her off a lot and approaching it like 'you're not even that busy' (from what you mentioned in another comment), or 'okay we can hang out, but only because I'm bored and boyfriend is busy', etc. That kind of stuff just makes people feel crappy. If I was her, it would make me feel like you don't even care- especially if she feels she's having to compete against a guy you've only known for 2 months when you're best friends. And honestly, I think most of us have experiences with friends being totally unaware of their own attitude and regard for friends when they start dating. No ones saying you have to prioritize her all the time, you're trying to create a life relationship with a partner after all, but it does sound like you're being very dismissal of someone whose trying their best to stay in contact with you.

It sucks when the other party cancels plans, but rejecting the invite because of pettiness is childish behavior. \n\nFriend should know that she can also cancel game day/night if life happens on her side too.", "Obviously", "People who neglect their friends, as soon as they get a partner, are the worst. They always run back to their friends and family as soon as their partner breaks up with them too. It\u2019s inevitable. My brother is like that. I cut those people out of my life. So self absorbed and toxic. They\u2019re sociopaths.", "Yeah like...a boat? That's it?", "Seems you missed all of OP\u2019s comment essentially calling the friend a backup and saying she is there for when OP is bored and the BF is busy, that makes OP the AH. Not to mention the manner in which OP speaks about their supposed friend is disgusting and only further cements the fact that they are the AH.", "i read it, it doesn\u2019t change my comment and the fact that you have nothing els to say is telling. jumping to calling someone a narcissist without understanding what it actually means is pathetic. your judgement was somehow nta which invalidates everything you said in the second paragraph. op is a trash friend who only wants to hang out to fill the void when she\u2019s bored and the bf is busy, major AH move", "you literally did say that but okay. no one is out of touch but you. it\u2019s basic respect to not use your friends as placeholders but obviously ah\u2019s like you wouldn\u2019t understand that. you seem bitter lmao", "Even if OP didn't say it to friend, they just said it to all of us asking for judgement: they were only reaching out to friend because they were bored and boyfriend was busy. That's NOT friendship, that's not \"I missed them and had some free time\". That's \"I can't stand being alone so I'm gonna use this 'friend' to kill time until something better comes along\". \n\nTo me, this story is less about the cancelling (which let's be honest was probably more than the 1 or 2 times OP says it was) and more about the obvious way in which OP uses this friend as a placeholder", "This smh canceling shit happens that shit is childish. Maybe if it\u2019s repeatedly done but a couple times is laughable. Adults have adult things more important then games sometimes.", "Cancelling plans because something unforeseen came up is not the same as cancelling plans to spend time with your bf just because he suddenly happened to be free. OP wouldn't be TA if she was genuinely cancelling because of something unforeseen. However, ditching plans with someone just to hang out with someone else is a shitty thing to do regardless of whether one is an adult or not. It's essentially telling that person that they are just a second choice/backup plan to you.", "Oh grow up will you? I explained that op needs to do better, and I explained that cancelling plans because your bf popped up with surprise plans isn't a good look. It's childish on her friends part to act the way she did without having a conversation like an actual adult. Instead of actually explaining how she felt, and both of them having a heart to heart, her friend is making a decision without giving op a chance to do better. \n\nAnd you writing me off because I'm not willing to crucify OP for a lapse in judgement is awfully telling of how black and white you think the world is.", "Did you even read the reasons she gave? Availability and a surprise concert. It's not like she just blew her off every other weekend. \nNothing to be bitter about, all I'm saying is that of course it happens. Nothing to feel bad about", "the only one who needs to grow up is you. you jumped to calling the friend a narcissist because she had boundaries. no one is writing you off for anything, you just have poor judgment and need to learn what a narcissist before jumping on the internet and calling someone it while obviously not understanding what it is, that\u2019s embarrassing. they were both childish, but that\u2019s not what op was asking. op asked if they were the AH and they were, the onus falls on her to fix this because she is responsible for the issues but it seems that you\u2019re insistent on making assumptions then calling people names. it wasn\u2019t a lack of judgement, its their entire approach (see ops comments) but you seem to love ignoring context to help defend your terrible arguments, how pathetic.", "Bro you called a rando in a story a narcissist (incorrectly BTW) and you want others to grow up? That\u2019s comical.", "and did you read ops comments where she says the purpose of friends is to cure her boredom? of course not because you continue to ignore context. the friend has every right to not keep around someone who treats her like that but ofc that doesn\u2019t matter to someone like you", "Firstly, mate, you have been attacking me since the first reply for what is a stupid little reddit post. Maybe in your head you're some white knight defending the friend, but find a better hobby than picking fights in the comments section. THAT is pathetic.\n\nSecondly, a person can do narcissistic actions without being a narcissist. One is a literal mental illness while the other is an adjective. Do I think the friend is a narcissist? Of course not. But not TALKING to OP about how she's feeling (which would lead to showing what could be perceived be narcissists as weakness), and deciding to just cause a scene when OP tries reaching out (granted as a back up plan, which I've said isn't a good look) shows me that the friend needs to work on herself just as much as OP. Never called her a narcissist, just that her actions are narcissistic. \n\nBut again, it looks like you came on here looking for an argument, so this is where I'm signing off. I'm not looking to feed this little hobby of yours.", "Mate, not wanting to talk through your feelings and causing a scene when things aren't going the way you want is classic narcissistic actions. And I never called her a narcissist. I described her actions as narcissistic. You can do something without being something. Quit looking for an argument in the replies.", "No I didn't get that far if I'm being honest, and I definitely don't agree with THAT.\nOtherwise, like I said, it happens", "no one attacked you, you got corrected and didn\u2019t like it. and yet again, you\u2019re using it incorrectly, their actions weren\u2019t in any way narcissistic, they were tired of being jerked around and expressed that. it may not have been a perfect response but it wasn\u2019t narcissistic. and jesus you seem really pissy because someone challenged your idea, no one is white knighting but you don\u2019t seem to know the proper meaning of any of these terms but seem to think throwing them around will help you. and if you didn\u2019t want to engage, why respond? oh right, you wanted to feel smart and failed. how sad", "It\u2019s not an argument to point out that a word was used incorrectly, Yikes. If anyone is being narcissistic it\u2019s OP and even that is a stretch. The friend may have been short but that is in no way narcissistic and people really need to stop jumping to use that word while ignoring context. Frustration \u2260 Narcissism. You seem annoyed that people have corrected you, it\u2019s  not that serious, just don\u2019t throw around terms incorrectly, simple.", "and as i said, it doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. some people care enough about their friends to still make an effort. it\u2019s fine if that\u2019s not you but it\u2019s not everyone", "Whatever you say, bud.", "Don't correct what isn't wrong then. Again, being a narcissist and doing something narcissistic is different. And again, causing a scene when things aren't going your way, and not expressing yourself in a proper conversation is narcissistic, because having feelings and being vulnerable is a weakness to narcissists. I don't believe the friend is a narcissist, and I never said I did. But people such as yourself are assuming because I said her actions were narcissistic, I believe the friend is a narcissist\n\nAnd yeah, I agree op needs to do better. That's what I explained in my original comment. I don't believe anyone is an asshole in this story, I believe OP had a lapse in judgement, and the friend just expected OP to read her mind on the matter. Now if it comes out that the friend tried approaching the subject, that's different, and I retract my comment on her actions. But as of right now, I don't hear anything like that."]}
