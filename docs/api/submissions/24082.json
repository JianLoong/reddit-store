But it kind of depends on how long he parked in your spot.  Fifteen minutes would make you the asshole.", "Yes! Well played! Well called out, too!\n\nYour neighbor wants you to clean a spot for him to park in. If not, he wouldn't care what you did.\n\nNTA for failing to do extra work you don't need so that your neighbor can benefit.", "NTA\n\nTruth hurts. But now you have a Bronco lol.", "NTA.
