I hate it when someone else parks in a parking spot directly in front of a house which has obviously been shoveled for the homeowner to park in! I am disabled and when I lived in a community with on-street parking, whenever it snowed, a few of the youth from my church would come by, move my car, shovel the parking space, sidewalk, ramp into the house, etc. The entire street knew that was where I would need to park and respected it. Some of the neighbors got in the habit of watching for the youth to come by and paying them to shovel for them, too. I had to go out one day to go to an important doctor's appointment and when I returned home, the neighbor's guests had squeezed two little cars into the spot meant for my disabled van. They had not shoveled the walkway in front of their house yet, either, so I was unable to even get out of my van as it would be dangerous - my wheelchair would have come off the van ramp and slid all over the place in the snow and ice. I called my neighbor from the van and asked, very politely, if they would ask their guests to move their cars so that I could get into the shoveled parking space. They were drinking and replied with an obscenity. I spent that night in a hotel as the snow was just too deep for me to even try to get to my house over the unshoveled sidewalks. As soon as the snow melted, I went to the city and had a dedicated handicapped space put in front of my house - it was a very long space, big enough for 2.5 cars to park. This made all of the on-street parking difficult on our block as almost everyone had two cars and there was just enough space for everyone to park if they did so considerately. I then sent a letter to all of my neighbors to explain why I had felt it necessary after 5 years of deliberately NOT getting my own handicapped space installed so that everyone would have room to park on the block. Needless to say, the homeowners on the block were not pleased with my neighbors who had refused to ask their guests to move their cars and would park their cars in front of their house whenever they could, just to inconvenience them!", "NTA, F that guy... :)", "NTA  in some cities he would get his ass kicked and his car vandalized for taking a spot that someone else cleaned off in front of their own house.

I would have posted video of him getting stuck lol.", "This is a good solution but especially if he cleans snow in front of his house. If the neighbor doesn\u2019t and takes his cleaned spot, the bronco can park on the neighbors spot and pack it down. Then even if he wants to park there, shoveling it will be a nightmare. After that, I highly suggest dumping more snow down on his spot and packing it there too. Basically petty but only in direct response to him being shitty. And a lasting consequence that will plague them all winter", "It could also be a situation where there is only parking on one side of the street. My old street was like that - so sometimes my across the street neighbours would be parked directly in front of our house. It was annoying in the winter for this exact reason - neighbours on that side never had to shovel the snow but often stole the shovelled areas.", "Park in front of his house, pack it all down while he clears out in front of his house, then move his car to the cleared spot.", "Those municipalities also prohibit street parking overnight when it snows, so the plows can work. If you want to park on the street overnight during a snowstorm, you've got to handle the snow yourself.", "Maybe in some.  In my municipality (Canada), some roads are declared off limits for a couple days around \"major snow events\". Other streets they plow one way, and the street parkers need to shovel themselves out, but don't typically fully clear a space.  In older parts of the city there is nothing but street parking, and if they banned you from parking on the street every time it snowed, then there'd be nowhere for people to park.", "I\u2019m in my 40\u2019s, and one thing I\u2019ve learn as an *almost* universal fact is - \u201cNo amount of effort or education will make an asshole less of an asshole.\u201d\n\nPeople don\u2019t just change for a neighbor, and I also refuse to just cater my time, money and effort so others can take advantage of me more than once.
