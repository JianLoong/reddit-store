Getting vaccines and having blood draws were an ordeal. I made a concerted effort to work on my perspective and reaction to injections/draws and now, as an adult, I no longer have any fear or anxiety with them. \n\nRecently, my physician prescribed me a new medication. Unfortunately, it can only be taken via a subcutaneous injection. Today was my first day taking the new drug. I had the medication and syringe set on the kitchen island while I was reading over the included materials. My seven-year-old son was sitting at the counter eating breakfast. He asked me what I was doing and I gave him a brief explanation. My son asked me if it would hurt. I told him, \"no\" (very small needles) and told him he could watch if he wanted. He appeared a little skeptical, but was not afraid. \n\nI was intentionally planning on giving myself the injection in front of my son. Like most children, he has a mild fear of needles, although, thankfully, nothing like the near hysteria I had as a child. My son and I are both due for our seasonal flu shots and I thought that letting him watch me inject myself in a safe and calm environment might help remove some of his fears. Seeing me do it once might only have a nominal effect, but seeing me do it regularly could normalize the process for him. If my son showed any genuine fear at the idea, I was prepared to change course. \n\nBack to the kitchen...\n\nI was standing at the kitchen island drawing the med into the syringe when my husband entered the room. He saw what I was doing and instantly became angry. He scolded me for, \"letting our son see you injecting yourself\". He said it was irresponsible and I was setting a bad example. At that moment, our son's demeanor completely changed and he said he was scared and didn't want to see it. Where we had calmly been talking just a moment prior, he was now jumping off the kitchen stool and exiting the room. I told my husband that our son did not have an issue until he said something. My husband brusquely replied that HE had an issue with it and I needed to do it later or somewhere else. Since we are talking about a prescribed medication and not an illegal street drug, my husband's response feels way off-base. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I do not approve or authorize the reposting/crossposting of this post on other Reddit boards, or other websites, apps, etc. My post is for the exclusive use of myself, and the AITA board/AITA mods/AITA users of Reddit.*", "created_utc": 1699544052, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rfl2w/aita_for_using_an_injectable_drug_in_front_of_of/", "score": 242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As long as you explained medicine safety to your son (e.g. that it isn't for him/others, why it has been prescribed for you) and you store it safely I don't see this as an issue. Kids are curious and like to learn. You had the opportunity to set a fantastic example for your son regarding needles not being something to fear.\n\nYour husband may have just set off a potential needle fear in your son for no reason than his own apparent issues. What are your husbands exact concerns with your son seeing you use the medicine you need?", "NTA at all.  That is a juvenile way to react.  Medications are needed and whether Injection or by mouth. \n\nI have taken daily injections for preterm labor and migraines. I have taken my child with me to get my Botox shots for migraines.   \nI show them I am not scared, and how to act even when it hurts a little.   This is life.  \n\nYour husband needs to check his phobias or whatever his issue is at the door and not pass them onto your child.", "NTA whatsoever. You did the normal/responsible parent thing and tried to teach your child about something that's part of your life. Your husband is projecting hard onto your kid.", "NTA. You were exposing your child to a very normal process. It's your job as a parent to expose children to different things to help allay fears and anxieties.\n\nINFO: Did your husband explain why he thought you were setting a bad example?", "NTA.  Your husband's reaction would have been the right one if you were shooting up heroine.   You were taking a prescribed medication in the appropriate manner and explaining it properly to your son.", "NTA even a little bit. Taking medicine in front of your son and normalizing getting medicine via needles would have been good for him if your husband hadn't completely ruined it. His whole reaction around this is just downright weird and inappropriate and he owes you an apology.", "NTA \nThe only way to get my kids to get their flu shots without complaining is if I get mine before in front of them. Fair enough.", "NTA\n\nThis is ridiculous. He's equating doing illegal drugs with injecting a legitimate, prescribed medication. Heaven forbid the kid learn there are legal, justified reasons to use a needle. Your husband needs to grow up.", "NTA, you were educating your son about medicine. I would ask your husband why he reacted the way he did. It's not like it was a recreational street drug, it's medicine. I assume he doesn't act this way if you took aspirin in front of your kid.", "NTA - you could have avoided a significant fear in your child and your husband ensured the fear instead.", "NTA\u2026 your husband is acting like you are doing something innapropriately (abusing drugs) when you are simply taking prescribed medication. Wtf ?", "NTA.\n\nIt wasn't like you were standing there snorting cocaine in front of your son. You were taking a physician-prescribed medication. It would be the same thing if it was in pill form.\n\nOn top of that, showing him what you were doing, showing him that it was a needle, but you weren't afraid of it, could actually be a positive thing. If he saw that you weren't bothered, when the time comes for him to have a vaccine or a blood draw, he could draw on this experience and be less afraid.", "Nta.\n\nYour son is more adult than your husband.", "NTA. You were doing exactly the right thing to help your son get over fear of needles.  Your husband has no business inserting himself in this to enforce a fear of needles.", "NTA if it\u2019s the first time injecting yourself I might have done it alone bc it isn\u2019t always easy but medical care of yourself is normal.  It\u2019s ableist af to expect people to sneak off and hide care in their own homes.", "Absolute NTA. As a Type 1 diabetic, my kids are gonna see me injecting myself many many times. For that matter, so are other people\u2019s children when I need to inject in public. You\u2019re doing your child a service by normalizing injections they might see other people needing to take around them, while also taking away the fear of needles kids are prone to. Good parenting all around.", "NTA it's not like you were shooting up heroin. Making medical things routine and not something to fear is good for a child to see.

I always brought heenfor injections etc so that shw could see it's no big deal.  Your husband is an ass and making this into an issue for your child.  Maybe you could ask kid of they want to see you do it because it's not scary and it doesn't hurt.", "NTA\n\nWhat a missed opportunity from your husband. You were doing a great thing in trying to help your son with a fear of needles and your husband acted like you were asking your son to tie you off for a heroin shot.", "NTA. Limited, Safe exposure to things is the absolute best way to normalize normally scary things.", "So what does he think of diabetic children who need to inject themselves? He\u2019s being super weird. You did really good for your kid and then he came in and sabotaged you! Not cool. NTA.", "NTA. My brother in law asked me before using an injectable in the same room as my young children and my response was \u201chey they get vaccines, seeing an adult calmly inject themself will probably help them see that it\u2019s no big deal\u201d.  \n\nHe gave himself his meds, my kids asked two questions, \u201cdoes that hurt, what does that do?\u201d \n\nThen we carried on with life.", "NTA. But your husband is. You weren't shooting heroin in front of your kid. You were injecting a medicine prescribed by your doctor for a medical condition. Big difference there. Does your husband think that your son will never come across someone who is diabetic? \n\nNope. Your husband shit the bed on this one. You had a great opportunity here to help your son overcome something none of us like doing (injections) and then your husband ruined it for whatever reason. Tell hubs is kiddo winds up with a phobia of needles, his ass can take him to the doctors. He can deal with it.", "NTA, your strategy was a good one. \n\nAs a side note, your consent means nothing for cross posting", "NTA - My husband is diabetic and he has 4 kids and 4 grand kids.

Good lord, your husband sounds like he would fly off the handle if you ever developed type two diabetes. He's way off. Way way off. I can't fathom any defense for his side of the argument.

Both my husband and I have taken other medications in front of our children (antibiotics, OTC anti-inflammatories, allergy meds, cold medicine, etc.).

You were handling the situation just fine. Plenty of insulin dependent diabetics have children that see this all the time. You were using a medication, not drugs.

He can deal with the consequences of his irrational behavior.", "That would be interesting, but I can say with certainty it wasn't his motivation.

Your husband not very smart.", "NTA how is taking your medication setting a bad example for your son? Obviously your son picked up on  your husband's mood and reacted accordingly.", "My two cents: Husband doesn't want to admit he's being emotional & illogical.

The fear went away and shots are now no big deal, which is great since I take allergy shots once a week now. \n\nDefinitely sit down with your husband as others have said and get to the bottom of why he is so upset about you taking shots in front of your son.

I have several severe medical issues, and for a very long time I was terrified to get any actual medical help because everything I had known was bad.

I\u2019m 22, but my body has issues akin to that of 40-50 year olds. Your husband, whatever his reason here, is wrong. Making sure your kid(s) know the difference between safe and not safe drugs, that it\u2019s not for them, and that there are safe ways to take the prescribed medication, could not only save his/their lives in the future, but also ensure that they have a much higher quality of his/their lives.", "NTA - OP please read this, and explain to your husband very carefully that you don't want your son to be afraid of needles.

Obviously this is a medication, but I wonder if he's afraid somehow that seeing you injecting yourself with this mediation will somehow lead him to be more susceptible to shooting up illegal drugs or something...? \n\nI think that's utterly ridiculous but it's an opinion some people have, so maybe that's where your husband is coming from. And if so, you can have a conversation to hopefully get him on board with how properly educating kiddo about legitimate prescribed medications/ injections under doctor supervision is a good thing and is not going to lead to hard core drug use. \n\nNTA", "Hmmm. \n\nI think he has some kind of problem with either the medication or the condition you\u2019re being treated for.\n\nFor example: I know that there\u2019s been an increase of people using Ozempic and Jardiance injections for weight loss.\n\nSo, using that as an example:\n\nHe may feel this medication is \u201clazy\u201d or \u201ccheating\u201d by and not \u201closing weight the right way\u201d, and that\u2019s a bad lesson for your son. \n\nHe may feel that the medication is dangerous or unsafe, because it\u2019s relatively new, and you\u2019re teaching your son to take unnecessary risks. \n\nHe may have an issue with you attempting weight loss at all, and feel you\u2019re teaching your son to have body issues.", "I don't disagree with your take. I'm curious why you are not using a CGM. If you are a T1D, why not use an insulin pump. My T1D son uses decom/ om iPod. The newest ones talk to each other and adjust the basal to prevent lows, mitigate highs. Medicare and therefore Medicaid are now covering CGMs for T2D as well as T1D. We are very close to getting CGMs approved for in hospital use.", "I know that injections are ordinary life for many people, but for me that would be pretty significant. I\u2019ve never had to inject myself with anything. I\u2019m very comfortable getting shots and tattoos, but as a medical need injections would be pretty out of the ordinary *for me*. \n\nIf I had to start taking suppositories, or even any new medication at all, I believe it would also come up with my wife. In that context, I think I would mention wanting to expose the kid (probably not to suppositories). I also don\u2019t expect she\u2019d have a problem with that because it\u2019s *not fucking heroin like OP\u2019s husband is acting like it is*. We communicate regularly and openly, though.", "Other than a kneejerk Reddit \u201cbiG PhaRmA bAd\u201d response, I don\u2019t see the basis for your comment. I strongly suspect that the number of people taking it for legitimate weight control reasons is dwarfed by the number who have hopped on the Hollywood trend. And in any case, even those taking it for legitimate weight control have a less acute need than those who need it to control their A1C. I\u2019m not T2D, but I know folks who are, and who can\u2019t get their _medicine_ because it\u2019s the latest fad \u201cdiet\u201d.", "And that puts you in the diabetes control population, who are legitimate users. Again, NTA. My objection is directed solely at those who use it as a trendy convenient weight loss gadget, and in doing so deny those with a more acute medical need.", "I don\u2019t like the way your husband makes decisions for you and your son.

I could use a second voice. lol", "I have been rolling the situation around in my head all day and that is the only thing I can come up with as well. It still seems wrong to me, but at least it's a viewpoint I can wrap my brain around.\nI plan to bring the situation up again tonight and see if he can help me to understand where he's coming from.", "Just to briefly address your latest point: My husband was fully aware of my new prescription and that it had to be injected. When we discussed it privately after I received the prescription, I asked him if he would assist me with the process as I had never given myself an injection before. It turns out that anger/frustration is a great motivator to learn and I had zero problem drawing the shot and giving it to myself after the situation in the kitchen.", "Okay, but I need brownies. The chewy kind", "If you need an anecdote:\n\nI had gestational diabetes and preterm labor (along with other complications)  with my younger two kids. My oldest, who was a toddler, watched me inject insulin and change out a medication pump for the PTL and preeclampsia meds all the time. All growing up he said he wanted to be a nurse. In college he changed his mind and is a wildfire certified fire/rescue paramedic. I guess nurse didn\u2019t fuel his adrenaline needs enough. Now, since that field doesn\u2019t pay well his actual primary income is as an auto mechanic, but he is on the wildfire reserves in our state and works on a city rig per diem when he wants to earn extra money. \n\nSo watching me inject medications not only didn\u2019t do anything bad, but probably set the foundation for his passion for rescue.", "God forbid your child see you taking care of yourself and prioritizing your health. /s", "Is he/are you American? Because istg, Americans are the only people I\u2019ve encountered on this planet who can take something like self-administering necessary medicine and find a way to turn it into a reason for moral outrage (and I say this as a dual citizen who actually likes the country for the most part). Unless you were heating your medication in a spoon, Dad doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on and needs to go find some real issues to worry about.", "I take biologics for ankylosing spondylitis and I have a fear of needles. I have a strong vasovagal reflex which makes me near-faint or faint. I was not excited to have to inject them, but after I started doing it, I realized it\u2019s actually really easy. I have to switch to an IV medication now which is sad. The injections are so convenient.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s surreal that your husband would think that it sets a bad example for your son. Mommy is addicted to her Humira? just what???? Instilling fear isn\u2019t setting a good model for your son when he inevitably will have to get vaccines and medications. He\u2019s also making the equivalence that needles = illicit drugs, and your son should know the difference.", "I make awesome brownies. I also make amazing cupcakes and have been known to mold my own sugar creations to put on top of them.  Cookies are decent. Chocolate dipped cake pops are great, but I can't ice a cake properly to save my life. Is that a deal breaker?", "Thank you for sharing that! Also, may I highly recommend your son consider ER nursing at a trauma facility with the goal of ultimately becoming a flight nurse in an area with ski resorts.

Neither did it make me feel scared ; in fact, I was never afraid to get my vaccinations or to get blood drawn. Nor did it turn me into a heroin-junkie.Medicine is part of our lives and nobody should have to hide stuff like this.\n\nHonestly it sounds like your husband has some stupid predjudice and sees your need for medication as some sort of \"bad behavior\".

A lot of type 1 diabetics are kids and they inject in front of their friends outside of school hours, because they inject before they eat.\n\nIMO, I think you did it exactly right.  I\u2019m just trying to wrap my brain around your husband\u2019s thought process.", "NTA. Your husband is being judgemental and just set your kid back in a MASSIVE way.\n\nI wasn't scared of needles as a kid until I saw my older sister howling in fear-- it fucked me up so bad that giving myself HRT was a struggle.

I can't watch myself get vaccinations!\n\nHaving poor examples at a young age has serious detrimental effects years down the road and I am so, so angry that someone stopped you from doing something GOOD.", "Nta, you were doing it to help him get over his fears and teach him. When I first read the title i thought you meant illegal drugs, but its legal and he never showed discomfort about it.", "Husband is worried about Heroine perhaps?", "NTA Thousands of Moms inject insulin daily multiple times. They don\u2019t hide it from their children. There is no evidence that they are mentally screwed up because of it. Thousands of children also get multiple injections daily. Or they die.

Your actions are likely to have a great impact on your child's future fear of shots, and one of the best ways to make your kids less afraid of ANYTHING, is to watch mommy or daddy do it, as kids want to be brave like their parents if parents are brave.

They're an adult now and told me that I was their favorite injector because I made it seem fun and cool. There's nothing shameful, dangerous, or unclean about injections.
