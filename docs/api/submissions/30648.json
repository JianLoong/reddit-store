{"id": 30648, "submission_id": "17rfl2w", "title": "AITA for Using an Injectable Drug in Front of of My Child", "selftext": "As a child and teenager, I was terrified of syringes. Getting vaccines and having blood draws were an ordeal. I made a concerted effort to work on my perspective and reaction to injections/draws and now, as an adult, I no longer have any fear or anxiety with them. \n\nRecently, my physician prescribed me a new medication. Unfortunately, it can only be taken via a subcutaneous injection. Today was my first day taking the new drug. I had the medication and syringe set on the kitchen island while I was reading over the included materials. My seven-year-old son was sitting at the counter eating breakfast. He asked me what I was doing and I gave him a brief explanation. My son asked me if it would hurt. I told him, \"no\" (very small needles) and told him he could watch if he wanted. He appeared a little skeptical, but was not afraid. \n\nI was intentionally planning on giving myself the injection in front of my son. Like most children, he has a mild fear of needles, although, thankfully, nothing like the near hysteria I had as a child. My son and I are both due for our seasonal flu shots and I thought that letting him watch me inject myself in a safe and calm environment might help remove some of his fears. Seeing me do it once might only have a nominal effect, but seeing me do it regularly could normalize the process for him. If my son showed any genuine fear at the idea, I was prepared to change course. \n\nBack to the kitchen...\n\nI was standing at the kitchen island drawing the med into the syringe when my husband entered the room. He saw what I was doing and instantly became angry. He scolded me for, \"letting our son see you injecting yourself\". He said it was irresponsible and I was setting a bad example. At that moment, our son's demeanor completely changed and he said he was scared and didn't want to see it. Where we had calmly been talking just a moment prior, he was now jumping off the kitchen stool and exiting the room. I told my husband that our son did not have an issue until he said something. My husband brusquely replied that HE had an issue with it and I needed to do it later or somewhere else. Since we are talking about a prescribed medication and not an illegal street drug, my husband's response feels way off-base. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I do not approve or authorize the reposting/crossposting of this post on other Reddit boards, or other websites, apps, etc. My post is for the exclusive use of myself, and the AITA board/AITA mods/AITA users of Reddit.*", "created_utc": 1699544052, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rfl2w/aita_for_using_an_injectable_drug_in_front_of_of/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As long as you explained medicine safety to your son (e.g. that it isn't for him/others, why it has been prescribed for you) and you store it safely I don't see this as an issue. Kids are curious and like to learn. You had the opportunity to set a fantastic example for your son regarding needles not being something to fear.\n\nYour husband may have just set off a potential needle fear in your son for no reason than his own apparent issues. What are your husbands exact concerns with your son seeing you use the medicine you need?", "NTA at all.  That is a juvenile way to react.  Medications are needed and whether Injection or by mouth. \n\nI have taken daily injections for preterm labor and migraines. I have taken my child with me to get my Botox shots for migraines.   \nI show them I am not scared, and how to act even when it hurts a little.   This is life.  \n\nYour husband needs to check his phobias or whatever his issue is at the door and not pass them onto your child.", "NTA whatsoever. You did the normal/responsible parent thing and tried to teach your child about something that's part of your life. Your husband is projecting hard onto your kid.", "NTA. You were exposing your child to a very normal process. It's your job as a parent to expose children to different things to help allay fears and anxieties.\n\nINFO: Did your husband explain why he thought you were setting a bad example?", "NTA.  Your husband's reaction would have been the right one if you were shooting up heroine.   You were taking a prescribed medication in the appropriate manner and explaining it properly to your son.", "NTA even a little bit. Taking medicine in front of your son and normalizing getting medicine via needles would have been good for him if your husband hadn't completely ruined it. His whole reaction around this is just downright weird and inappropriate and he owes you an apology.", "NTA \nThe only way to get my kids to get their flu shots without complaining is if I get mine before in front of them. Fair enough.", "NTA\n\nThis is ridiculous. He's equating doing illegal drugs with injecting a legitimate, prescribed medication. Heaven forbid the kid learn there are legal, justified reasons to use a needle. Your husband needs to grow up.", "NTA, you were educating your son about medicine. I would ask your husband why he reacted the way he did. It's not like it was a recreational street drug, it's medicine. I assume he doesn't act this way if you took aspirin in front of your kid.", "NTA - you could have avoided a significant fear in your child and your husband ensured the fear instead.", "NTA\u2026 your husband is acting like you are doing something innapropriately (abusing drugs) when you are simply taking prescribed medication. Wtf ?", "NTA.\n\nIt wasn't like you were standing there snorting cocaine in front of your son. You were taking a physician-prescribed medication. It would be the same thing if it was in pill form.\n\nOn top of that, showing him what you were doing, showing him that it was a needle, but you weren't afraid of it, could actually be a positive thing. If he saw that you weren't bothered, when the time comes for him to have a vaccine or a blood draw, he could draw on this experience and be less afraid.", "Nta.\n\nYour son is more adult than your husband.", "NTA. You were doing exactly the right thing to help your son get over fear of needles.  Your husband has no business inserting himself in this to enforce a fear of needles.", "NTA if it\u2019s the first time injecting yourself I might have done it alone bc it isn\u2019t always easy but medical care of yourself is normal.  It\u2019s ableist af to expect people to sneak off and hide care in their own homes.", "Absolute NTA. As a Type 1 diabetic, my kids are gonna see me injecting myself many many times. For that matter, so are other people\u2019s children when I need to inject in public. You\u2019re doing your child a service by normalizing injections they might see other people needing to take around them, while also taking away the fear of needles kids are prone to. Good parenting all around.", "NTA it's not like you were shooting up heroin. Making medical things routine and not something to fear is good for a child to see. My daughter was your son's age when I first had to subcutaneous injections and she isn't afraid of needles now, she doesn't like them but won't avoid if it's necessary.", "NTA\nMy daughter wanted to come into thw nurse with mw to watch me get my bloods taken and she just watched and said cool.  I always brought heenfor injections etc so that shw could see it's no big deal.  Your husband is an ass and making this into an issue for your child.  Maybe you could ask kid of they want to see you do it because it's not scary and it doesn't hurt.", "NTA\n\nWhat a missed opportunity from your husband. You were doing a great thing in trying to help your son with a fear of needles and your husband acted like you were asking your son to tie you off for a heroin shot.", "NTA. Limited, Safe exposure to things is the absolute best way to normalize normally scary things.", "So what does he think of diabetic children who need to inject themselves? He\u2019s being super weird. You did really good for your kid and then he came in and sabotaged you! Not cool. NTA.", "NTA. My brother in law asked me before using an injectable in the same room as my young children and my response was \u201chey they get vaccines, seeing an adult calmly inject themself will probably help them see that it\u2019s no big deal\u201d.  \n\nHe gave himself his meds, my kids asked two questions, \u201cdoes that hurt, what does that do?\u201d \n\nThen we carried on with life.", "NTA. But your husband is. You weren't shooting heroin in front of your kid. You were injecting a medicine prescribed by your doctor for a medical condition. Big difference there. Does your husband think that your son will never come across someone who is diabetic? \n\nNope. Your husband shit the bed on this one. You had a great opportunity here to help your son overcome something none of us like doing (injections) and then your husband ruined it for whatever reason. Tell hubs is kiddo winds up with a phobia of needles, his ass can take him to the doctors. He can deal with it.", "NTA, your strategy was a good one. \n\nAs a side note, your consent means nothing for cross posting", "NTA - My husband is diabetic and he has 4 kids and 4 grand kids. It never created any issues. I grew up with a diabetic sister and never had any word thoughts about it. Maybe you and your husband should talk to your kiddos pediatrician?", "NTA. What, is your husband worried your child will see you doing an uncomfortable routine task and be so amazed that he intentionally develops whatever medical condition you have so he can get his own prescription?", "NTA. Good lord, your husband sounds like he would fly off the handle if you ever developed type two diabetes. He's way off. Way way off. I can't fathom any defense for his side of the argument. You should feel dirty because your medication is subcutaneous injection only? Why? What's gone wrong in his head that this is problematic?", "NTA\n\nYou are taking medication and you are normalizing the method of taking it.   \nPlus, you said you and your son both need flu shots, so doing this in front of the child is good for him to see that it doesn\u2019t need to be an issue.\n\nYour husband is being an AH about it.  Seriously an AH.", "NTA. If you were injecting heroin, I would understand the problem. But you\u2019re not, so\u2026.", "NTA at all, but it\u2019s striking that this wasn\u2019t naturally a part of a discussion with your partner. I wouldn\u2019t seek out permission to do this, but I also can\u2019t imagine not discussing it as part of a general conversation about starting injections. If my wife started injections, and had a history of a needle phobia, I\u2019d definitely talk to her about it; it seems like that would be a good time to mention the kid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You weren't shooting up heroin, you were taking a medication and using the opportunity to teach your son that needles don't have to be scary. \n\nMy daughter is terrified of needles. During covid I brought her with me for each jab so she could see it wasn't that bad. Made getting her shot when it was out for her age group a lot easier. The pharmacists even commented about how it was a good idea.", "NTA. _(Unless you\u2019re taking Ozempic to lose weight, in which case YTA for an entirely different reason and any number of Type II diabetics who can\u2019t get their medicine would probably cordially invite you to fuck all the way off.)_", "I asked my husband what the issue was (I'm sure my own irritation was evident in my voice) and he simple reiterated what he said the first time. Not getting anywhere with the subject, I left the room to finish what I started. After that, I left to take our son to school and my husband started work, so we have not spoken about it again.", "I just went through several weeks of injections. My little guy was super curious about it, so I got him involved. He helped sterilize my surfaces, he help draw up the meds from a vial, he even helped inject. I figured it would help him deal with needles a bit better, at least not be so scared. \n\nAlso, a curious toddler is even worse than a cat, it's easier to give them a job than to keep them away.", "No, he did not.

When we met, I had already overcome my fear. That said, our college-aged daughter has passed out more than once during a blood draw because of her anxiety/fear of needles. She actually has to lay down before receiving vaccines or having blood drawn because of the risk of her losing consciousness, and they often use pediatric needles on her. My husband knows this, but he has never had to deal with it directly as I am the one who takes our children for their shots and draws.\n\nHad I thought he would have a concern, I would have discussed it with him beforehand. However, I honestly did not imagine an issue with trying to demonstrate learning how to overcome a fear by taking a prescribed medication. Both my husband and I have taken other medications in front of our children (antibiotics, OTC anti-inflammatories, allergy meds, cold medicine, etc.). From my POV, this was just another medication that happened to come with an opportunity for my son to witness my lack of fear taking it.", ">NTA at all, but it\u2019s striking that this wasn\u2019t naturally a part of a discussion with your partner.\n\nI get what you are saying, but I'd have never thought to mention it. It's just normal ordinary life, and why would I bring up ordinary?\n\nNTA.", "You need to explain to him what his actions did. How you were trying to prepare him for the future and all he did was scare him and how that will affect future important vaccinations. \n\nNTA", "Sounds like your husband should be the one taking your child(ren) to get alllllllll of their vaccinations.", "He can't say he has an issue with something without explaining why. You both need to have a sit down, where he explains his stance and you tell him why you thought it was a good idea. He also needs to see the negative effect his reaction had on your son, and how needles/jabs are going to have an even more negative connotation for him now.", "\"So what you're saying is, showing our son that I'm taking a prescription medication that the doctor prescribed to me is setting a bad example. Can you explain why that is?\"  \n\n\nReframe his objection and make him clarify.   \n\n\nNTA, but I'm not sure he's intentionally being TA here, or if he's just reacting on an emotion that he can't quite describe and has (hopefully) chosen his words poorly.", "Thank you, and Happy Cake Day!", "The big strong man would have to admit that HE is afraid of needles.", "NTA. You were handling the situation just fine. Plenty of insulin dependent diabetics have children that see this all the time. You were using a medication, not drugs. After what your partner did, you should have him take your child for the flu shot. He can deal with the consequences of his irrational behavior.", "That would be interesting, but I can say with certainty wasn't his motivation. My husband's career has required him to use more needles (injections, IV starts, etc) than he can count, and he's never hesitated to get flu shots or updated vaccines."]}
