Two years ago he got remarried to Emily (38f). Frank has three children with his first wife. Ava (14f), Noa (13f) and Harley (10m). Emily also has a son (9m) and a stepdaughter from her ex-husband who she has custody of (12f). Frank and Emily started dating just before the pandemic hit. The kids were not aware of the fact Frank was dating. He told them two months before the wedding. It was a month later he announced he was getting married and Emily and her kids were moving in.\n\nFrank's kids have adapted worse than Emily's kids. The kids have refused to take part in family activities, are distant and cold with Emily and her kids and have yelled at my brother multiple times, accusing him of replacing their mom and saying fuck Emily, they don't care about Emily, they don't want Emily, etc.\n\nFrank, Emily, Ava, Noa and Harley have started attending family counseling (7ish months or so now). They have seen three therapists thus far because the kids would \"sit and sulk\" per Frank's own words and would not open up or engage and each time the therapist ends up just talking to Frank and Emily.\n\nFrank started to complain about how mad the kids are at him. He said they were selfish for expecting him to stay single for the rest of his life. He said he's tired of them making no effort to make the blended family work. He said he hates how they work against it and he hates how people treat him like he made a mistake when he remarried. He wanted to know if he wasn't entitled to his happiness, etc.\n\nI listened to him vent countless times. Last time he told me he felt I had something to say and I should just say it. I told him his mistake was never in remarrying, but in how he did it. He only told the kids he was dating two months prior to his wedding, told them a month later he was getting married and three people were moving in and then married in that two month timeline when everything was still very new and strange to them. I told him most kids will struggle with the idea of their parent moving on after divorce or the death of their parent. That's why people usually spend years dating and getting the kids adjusted so they have time to process and work through their feelings, to work through the fresh wave of grief that hearing news like that would bring. I said dating and letting everyone get to know each other over a period of time and helping the kids through is the best way to make a blended family.\n\nHe got mad at me and told me he shouldn't have to adjust his timeline for anyone, not even his kids. I asked him how he'd feel to hear dad is dating someone (30 years after our mom died). He told me there is no way dad would do that and fuck me for even suggesting it. I told him so he'd have a problem with it but can't understand his kids having a problem with him doing it. He told me it's not the same and he's not judging dad but I'm judging him and that makes me an asshole.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701262716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186ot4f/aita_for_telling_my_brother_his_mistake_wasnt_in/", "score": 3085, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel certain that the therapists have touched on this but it's pretty uh gross the way he talks about his kids being \"selfish\" and how he shouldn't have to adjust his timeline (of...moving in with a bunch of strangers??) for his kid.

I bet your brother will loose contact with his kids when they turn 18 the way it's going.", "NTA, hes a hypocrite, in denial and a horrible father. He put HIS own needs before his own kids.

I have a question though, do you know what kind of relationship he had, if any at all, with her kids prior to the marriage? If he was spending time/building relationships with her kids while they were dating and his kids were left in the dark, that's a whole different level of betrayal. As kids it would be difficult enough knowing that your parent is moving on (mine were only divorced and it sucked), then to find out they've essentially been lied to for 2 years? This process is going to take a long time, and he needs to accept that his decision will have long-term repercussions.", "Nta he asked your opinion and you gave it.

Funnily enough, his kids (who will have a lot of his traits) are having a strop about his behaviour.\n\nIt's funny how he has behaved selfishly and then accused his kids of being selfish!\n\nHe should have taken this slowly. Informed his kids about it. Tried to make it more of a gradual thing, rather than such a quick shock.\n\nWhilst it's true that even with the effort, his kids may never have been happy with the situation, at least he'd have tried to help it.", "He's only angry with you because he knows your right especially after giving him that example.

He has 8 years to try to make amends with his children, but they are never going to be receptive to it.", "NTA.  Fact is, you tried to be polite and keep your opinion to yourself.  Frank literally demanded that you share your opinion.  \n\nAnd you are right.  A couple months is not enough time for the kids to adjust to new people moving in.  One approach to therapy would be for your brother to go with his kids to family therapy, separate from the other kids.  His bio kids have a lot of emotions toward your brother, and they need to be able to express them to him I. a safe space.", "It would be awesome if OP six months after that makes their father call his bro to tell him he is getting married. Just to see the reaction and enought time that the bro couldnt get sus.", "NTA and I'm willing to bet that part of the reason he's gone through so many therapists is because at least 1 therapist has told him the same thing you did and he freaked out and got pissed and left. Because he \\*can't\\* be wrong.", "NTA.  Be there for these kids.  Your brother has possibly irrevocably damaged his relationship with his children and I bet the reason they have swapped therapists has as much to do with them echoing what you told him as it does the kids\u2019 \u201cunwillingness to participate.\u201d", "NTA.  He is quite wrong and you are right and you said the truth and he just doesn't want to hear it.  His kids will go LC or NC when they turn 18 and he will complain about this for the rest of his life and never take responsibility.  Sad on all sides.", "NTA. When a parent say \"I shouldn't adjust or make sacrifices for anybody, not even my kids\", it is a sign or bad parenting as it finest. In fact, parenting is putting your kids first and making constant sacrifices. And not rushing to marry another person with more children shouldn't be the most important one.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is a dumbass.\n\nI imagine the therapists have probably all told him much the same too.", "NTA.OP I hope you keep in contact and let these kids know that they have atleast one family member who understands their dad is not being a good father.", "NTA. Your brother is unreasonable, but you already know that. Frank is a rigid thinker who can only see things from his point of view, even when you point out his own hypocrisy. None of this is going to change. It is very likely that the three therapists didn't work out because they told Frank the same things you did, and Frank clearly doesn't want to hear the truth from anyone, if it doesn't coincide with his truth.", "NTA but can you let the older kids know you are there for them and you understand?\n\nThose kids must be feeling so powerless and alone", "Of course, he'll be wondering why his kids went NC once they hit 18. He played a stupid game and is seeing his stupid prizes.\n\nOP, you're NTA.", "Hi, child of something similar here. \n\nMy dad had an affair and separated from our mom to date the other woman. Two years later, our mother suddenly died and my siblings and I were left to pick up the pieces. Two months later my dad\u2019s gf and her kids would do shit they never would have done had our mother still been alive. Her son was enrolled in the same program as my sister and my dad didn\u2019t tell her until a week before it ended. Her kids found us on social media and reached out to us and showed up to our house unannounced. My dad waited days to tell us he was proposing to her. He waited a week before telling us her and her family were spending thanksgiving with us. By that point I moved out and my siblings spent the holiday with me at my place. Our dad waited four days prior to my sister coming home from campus to tell her this woman she had never formally met was already in the process of moving in. She lived with me for the summer and my brother stayed at his campus apartment, and we got an earful about how sad our dad was not to have his kids around him. \n\nWe don\u2019t like spending holidays with him. We rarely talk to him anymore but my siblings still have to be reliant on him. It\u2019s now been four years, and I truly and wholeheartedly believe that we could have worked things out with him and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family had things been different. But time and time again it feels like he does whatever he wants and we have to play catch-up. There\u2019s no emotional work on his end despite us explicitly communicating how all of this has made us feel. But somehow he\u2019s still dumbfounded when we\u2019d rather spend the holidays with our mom\u2019s relatives. \n\nThis is all to say, NTA. Those kids desperately need someone in their corner and, as his brother, you did wonderfully in stepping up for them.

That family will *never* blend now, his kids will continue their behavior with more and more animosity, anger, bitterness, resentment and outright hatred building. It could (and most certainly will) get to bullying and violent outbursts towards the step family. One of the step kids could very well end up badly injured/traumatized if this escalates, and it certainly will. Eventually they will go NC when they become adults, and frankly I would have if I had such a thoughtless and selfish father.\n\nMost you can do is be blunt and make it clear that if he loves his children even in the slightest, he will do what *all good fathers do* and put their wellbeing above his own. He messed up this blending in a **permanent** way and he needs to end the marriage immediately or his children won't ever want a relationship with him once they don't have to. In the meantime they will make everyone's life hell and it will only get worse. Until then you have no respect for him as a father until he steps up to the plate as a MAN and puts them first, even if it hurts. Thats what a father does, thats what a real man does and he is neither if he won't. That you feel nothing but shame and disgust for even sharing your DNA with him. That you now consider him a negligent father and emotional child abuser. If he wants a good relationship with his kids, that is his only option, divorce. Be BRUTAL AND BREAK HIM DOWN! If you can get family and/or his friends on your side, an intervention with ultimatum of disowning could work, but it would need to be a hell of a dressing down. Like make him cry uncontrollably dressing down. Use his wife's memories, every low blow to get past his defenses. If that works get the kids in and have him promise to divorce. Manipulate, it's worth it for the outcome.\n\n**Be on his kids side** though, and make it clear to them they can always talk to you, even if their dad is a selfish father. Get a burner for the eldest to hide before any further talks with your brother. Don't sugar coat it for them, they are old enough for you to be blunt and have questions answered as such (yes even a 10 year old, kids aren't stupid). At least then they KNOW they have a loving relationship with *someone* in the family who prioritizes their needs and they NEED that. They are feeling neglected, insulted, steamrolled, angry and as not a priority in their dad's eyes (and they are right, he doesn't love them as a father).

They didn\u2019t ask for any of it and now they have to suffer, feel pain and fear, they have to have their hearts broken multiple times, they have to die one day, life is not the only experience we are thrusting onto their shoulders. The least he could\u2019ve done was treat them like whole ass human beings and respect the grieving process for their mother. I\u2019m a single parent and I\u2019ve put off dating completely bc i don\u2019t feel it\u2019s in the best interest of my child with the way our lives are structured. My child comes first, i will still date again one day, and I get to use this time to also focus on myself so i can be my healthiest when i do begin to date again. But i could never imagine causing my child pain with my dating and just ignoring it and expecting them to suck it up. They\u2019re a human being, just bc they\u2019re younger or I\u2019m the parent doesn\u2019t mean that i get to do whatever i want however i want when they just don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s awful.", "You are 100% correct and NTA.", "NTA. Hypocrites gonna hypocrite", "Frank had a visceral reaction to just thinking about your dad dating 30 years after your mom has died but thinks his own kids 6 years after burying their mom should be cool with learning, meeting and living with a new stepmom and her kids in 60 days? Definitely NTA and he needs to realize he has messed up this entire situation from the start.", "OP - your brother never grew up and thinks with his sick.", "NTA. Your brother doesn't seem the brightest.\n\nBut at least now, he's heard the truth. Whether or not he's ready to admit it to himself, the truth at least lives somewhere up there in his head.", "NTA. Your brother needs to apologize to his kids and try to have a restart if he wants to salvage that family situation.", "NTA.\nHe rushed it indeed and didn't think a second about his kids' feelings. Is apparently proud of it and annoyed at the same time. ..", "NTA. Your brother is an obtuse asshole.", "NTA. But you handled one ok.", "NTA\n\n> He told them two months before the wedding. It was a month later he announced he was getting married and Emily and her kids were moving in.\n\nWhat did he think was going to happen?!?\n\n> He got mad at me and told me he shouldn't have to adjust his timeline for anyone, not even his kids. \n\nThen he's a bad father.  When you have kids, everything should be for the good of the kid.  I'm not saying spoil them - because proper discipline is good for them too.   I mean make them into good people with good futures and good childhoods.  \n\nAnd that means until his youngest is at least 18 then everything about his life needed to be for their benefit.  Everything.  That type of sacrifice is why not everyone is cut out to have kids.  \n\nHe isn't cut out for it at all.  His kids will suffer for it.", "NTA sounds like he needs some therapy and to learn to be more open and less self centered", "NTA. Your brother is a HUGE AH. So is Emily to allow this. No one thought of the kids?   He asked for advice but then argued with said advice.  Just be there for your neices and nephew as best you can because he's killed their relationship.   That's on him.", "NTA. Your brother\u2019s lack of empathy towards his children is concerning. What you said to him was exactly what he had to hear. The issue is that is seems as though no one is there is listen to the children. Consider taking them out from time to time or just doing some activities with them. I think it would healthy for them to just spend some time outside the house.", "NTA, Frank is one selfish AH", "NTA. Also Frank is being a hypocritical AH if he would be mad if your dad started dating someone, but his kids have to accept him dating someone?!? How do you not see that that is the exact same thing like.", "Nta, your brother is a huge YTA though", "Nta. You did good and hopefully the brother takes his head out of his bum.", "Obviously NTA. He wants to blame his children for how things are instead of himself, what an absolute AH. Telling someone the truth is a thankless task but if he had been willing to listen to you it could have been the start of him finding a new path. He\u2019s made the choice to throw you into the blame pot.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother is ridiculous. And so is Emily for agreeing to something so ludicrous.", "Do your best to be there for those kids, even taking them in when they can break free of such a selfish jerk. They need people who care about them more than their crappy dad's selfish desires.", "NTA.  You spoke the truth and he yells at you for it.", "NTA your brother is a completely selfish asshole. He knows he\u2019s wrong but refuses to admit it and this: \n\n> He told me there is no way dad would do that and fuck me for even suggesting it. I told him so he'd have a problem with it but can't understand his kids having a problem with him doing it. He told me it's not the same\n\nIs beyond frustrating and I would\u2019ve been done talking to him or letting him vent to me after saying something so hypocritically idiotic.", "NTA. \n\nAbsolutely not. Your brother does not seem to understand that as a parent, as a widower, that it is not just about him and his happiness. He didn't want to put in the time and effort of blending the family and now he is reaping the whirlwind. \n\nUnless he starts actually caring about how his children feel and starts putting in effort, his relationship with his first three is never going to be repaired. He is making it clear that their feelings don't matter to him, so why would they open up around him? \n\nThis is the bitter pill of his life and he is choking on it instead of actually taking the medicine like a grown ass adult.", "NTA: you are right...but your brother has been an AH to everyone involved. He was ugly to you. He didn't give his kids time to adjust. And he set his new wife and step kids up for failure. He was very shortsighted.", "NTA. Your brother is though.", "NTA. Your brother is though.", "He doesn't seem to understand he is a parent, it is his job to put his kids needs first. At the rate he's going none of them will be speaking to him once they hit 18. If he's lucky they'll give him two months notice.", "This mentality is baffling. Dude, you\u2019re a father. You have a responsibility to these kids and what is best for them. Sorry, but you have to consider them in your decisions if you want to be a halfway decent parent l. It\u2019s insane that he\u2019s acting this way.", "They're so used to having their thoughts shut down or being retaliated against they don't even see the counselor's office as a safe space. They each need one on one therapy, but I don't think Frank will be receptive to that because he won't be there to control the narrative.", "I mean this speaks volumes about who he is as a parent and a person, putting himself before his own children.", "NTA.", "Then a month later having three people, one of whom they're expected to see as a maternal figure and the other as siblings, move in when they have no say over it with a month before the wedding (so basically a very hectic period). That's no proper amount of time to process first that dad is dating again and remarrying, then that their home is no longer fully their home anymore, add in the ages and a happy blended family would be a surprising outcome.", "But it worked so well for Step-by-Step, the Brady Bunch, and Cheaper by the Dozen! /s\n\nNTA.", "It makes Frank a hypocrite. He, an adult with kids of his own, doesn't like the idea of his widowed father remarrying but is trying to force a blended family with his dependent children that's turning out more oil and water. He's happy with Emily, but he's not the only person this impacts nor does it override his responsibility to his kids.", ">IDK what goes through peoples mind when they remarry and try to do a blended family.\n\nNothing, I expect.  Everything going through the lower head rather than the upper one.", "So their mom died when his brother was 10 not so far off in age from his kids.", "I also wonder how Emily can also be so equally dumb to agree to this.  Doesn\u2019t she want a happy home?  It\u2019s not rocket science that moving into a house with 3 strangers and she and her kids are also strangers to them, was going to be tough. Sounds like a ton of bamboozaling going on between Emily and Frank too.  Who needs to move in that fast?", "Or they will go No contact and he will be all surprised Pikachu face and Missing missing reasons... I find that scenario more likely unfortunately", "Touchy rather than admitting touch\u00e9.", "The Blue Moon, because that's how often residents get visitors.", "Exactly!! Your kids should always always always come before a man / woman. I get he wants to carry on with his life and I'm sure they'd have been supportive of that if only they'd had been given the chance to get used to it. It's quite sad really.", "Oblivious is generous. The man is defensive, dismissive, and utterly selfish. And the kids know this. So why bother?", "In Calvin and Hobbs, Calvin tells hid dad exactly what he thinks about that. \"Calvin, why don't you do something you hate? Being miserable builds character.\"\n\nNone of that here. You can feel the lack of compassion.", "Mere passage of time and penis usage don't coffer \"not fucking dumb\" status by themselves.", "Missing missing reasons and all...", "Emily has been a stepmother before, she should be more aware of how the kids won't guarantee automatically fit into the blended family.", "[removed]", "Well, we know Frank didn't talk to his kids about what was going on.\n\nI think he also didn't talk to Emily about how he hadn't talked to his kids.   \n\n\n>Who needs to move in that fast?\n\nFrank needed a stepmother for his kids - he figured he'd been stuck with looking after them far too long. He needed to move her in that fast. And he figured he could override his kids views and bamboozle Emily into thinking everything was fine.", "He may have needed to get out there and date, but he didn\u2019t need to be married. Eventually sure, but not as soon as two months after announcing the relationship. I feel Emily herself is a big part of the rushed timeline.  Maybe she was getting evicted or something.", "Make a suggestion that either the kids go as a trio by themselves for a time and eventually add Dad as they are ready. No Emily untill after.", "is there any updates ??", "He's dragged them to *three* different therapists so that the therapists will \"fix\" them.  Betting that those therapists expected him to alter his behavior, not theirs.", "True. It's just pathetic that, now that I think on it, *two* \"full blown\" adults with multiple kids each manage to be so fucking immature. \n\nForget the dad who would be so cruel to his own children, what woman would agree to this shit??\n\n*All* of these kids have been saddled with teenagers masquerading as adults because *what* the fuck is this situation.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
