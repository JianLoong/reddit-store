Two years ago he got remarried to Emily (38f). Frank has three children with his first wife. Ava (14f), Noa (13f) and Harley (10m). Emily also has a son (9m) and a stepdaughter from her ex-husband who she has custody of (12f). Frank and Emily started dating just before the pandemic hit. The kids were not aware of the fact Frank was dating. He told them two months before the wedding. It was a month later he announced he was getting married and Emily and her kids were moving in.\n\nFrank's kids have adapted worse than Emily's kids. The kids have refused to take part in family activities, are distant and cold with Emily and her kids and have yelled at my brother multiple times, accusing him of replacing their mom and saying fuck Emily, they don't care about Emily, they don't want Emily, etc.\n\nFrank, Emily, Ava, Noa and Harley have started attending family counseling (7ish months or so now). They have seen three therapists thus far because the kids would \"sit and sulk\" per Frank's own words and would not open up or engage and each time the therapist ends up just talking to Frank and Emily.\n\nFrank started to complain about how mad the kids are at him. He said they were selfish for expecting him to stay single for the rest of his life. He said he's tired of them making no effort to make the blended family work. He said he hates how they work against it and he hates how people treat him like he made a mistake when he remarried. He wanted to know if he wasn't entitled to his happiness, etc.\n\nI listened to him vent countless times. Last time he told me he felt I had something to say and I should just say it. I told him his mistake was never in remarrying, but in how he did it. He only told the kids he was dating two months prior to his wedding, told them a month later he was getting married and three people were moving in and then married in that two month timeline when everything was still very new and strange to them. I told him most kids will struggle with the idea of their parent moving on after divorce or the death of their parent. That's why people usually spend years dating and getting the kids adjusted so they have time to process and work through their feelings, to work through the fresh wave of grief that hearing news like that would bring. I said dating and letting everyone get to know each other over a period of time and helping the kids through is the best way to make a blended family.\n\nHe got mad at me and told me he shouldn't have to adjust his timeline for anyone, not even his kids. I asked him how he'd feel to hear dad is dating someone (30 years after our mom died). He told me there is no way dad would do that and fuck me for even suggesting it. I told him so he'd have a problem with it but can't understand his kids having a problem with him doing it. He told me it's not the same and he's not judging dad but I'm judging him and that makes me an asshole.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701262716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186ot4f/aita_for_telling_my_brother_his_mistake_wasnt_in/", "score": 1541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel certain that the therapists have touched on this but it's pretty uh gross the way he talks about his kids being \"selfish\" and how he shouldn't have to adjust his timeline (of...moving in with a bunch of strangers??) for his kid.

I bet your brother will loose contact with his kids when they turn 18 the way it's going.", "NTA, hes a hypocrite, in denial and a horrible father. He put HIS own needs before his own kids.

I have a question though, do you know what kind of relationship he had, if any at all, with her kids prior to the marriage? If he was spending time/building relationships with her kids while they were dating and his kids were left in the dark, that's a whole different level of betrayal. As kids it would be difficult enough knowing that your parent is moving on (mine were only divorced and it sucked), then to find out they've essentially been lied to for 2 years? This process is going to take a long time, and he needs to accept that his decision will have long-term repercussions.", "Nta he asked your opinion and you gave it.

Funnily enough, his kids (who will have a lot of his traits) are having a strop about his behaviour.\n\nIt's funny how he has behaved selfishly and then accused his kids of being selfish!\n\nHe should have taken this slowly.

Tried to make it more of a gradual thing, rather than such a quick shock.\n\nWhilst it's true that even with the effort, his kids may never have been happy with the situation, at least he'd have tried to help it.", "He's only angry with you because he knows your right especially after giving him that example.

He has 8 years to try to make amends with his children, but they are never going to be receptive to it.", "NTA.  Fact is, you tried to be polite and keep your opinion to yourself.  Frank literally demanded that you share your opinion.  \n\nAnd you are right.  A couple months is not enough time for the kids to adjust to new people moving in.  One approach to therapy would be for your brother to go with his kids to family therapy, separate from the other kids.  His bio kids have a lot of emotions toward your brother, and they need to be able to express them to him I. a safe space.", "It would be awesome if OP six months after that makes their father call his bro to tell him he is getting married. Just to see the reaction and enought time that the bro couldnt get sus.", "NTA and I'm willing to bet that part of the reason he's gone through so many therapists is because at least 1 therapist has told him the same thing you did and he freaked out and got pissed and left. Because he \\*can't\\* be wrong.", "NTA.  Be there for these kids.  Your brother has possibly irrevocably damaged his relationship with his children and I bet the reason they have swapped therapists has as much to do with them echoing what you told him as it does the kids\u2019 \u201cunwillingness to participate.\u201d", "NTA.  He is quite wrong and you are right and you said the truth and he just doesn't want to hear it.  His kids will go LC or NC when they turn 18 and he will complain about this for the rest of his life and never take responsibility.  Sad on all sides.", "NTA. When a parent say \"I shouldn't adjust or make sacrifices for anybody, not even my kids\", it is a sign or bad parenting as it finest. In fact, parenting is putting your kids first and making constant sacrifices. And not rushing to marry another person with more children shouldn't be the most important one.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is a dumbass.\n\nI imagine the therapists have probably all told him much the same too.", "NTA.OP I hope you keep in contact and let these kids know that they have atleast one family member who understands their dad is not being a good father.", "NTA. Your brother is unreasonable, but you already know that. Frank is a rigid thinker who can only see things from his point of view, even when you point out his own hypocrisy. None of this is going to change. It is very likely that the three therapists didn't work out because they told Frank the same things you did, and Frank clearly doesn't want to hear the truth from anyone, if it doesn't coincide with his truth.", "NTA but can you let the older kids know you are there for them and you understand?\n\nThose kids must be feeling so powerless and alone", "Of course, he'll be wondering why his kids went NC once they hit 18. He played a stupid game and is seeing his stupid prizes.\n\nOP, you're NTA.", "Hi, child of something similar here. \n\nMy dad had an affair and separated from our mom to date the other woman. Two years later, our mother suddenly died and my siblings and I were left to pick up the pieces. Two months later my dad\u2019s gf and her kids would do shit they never would have done had our mother still been alive. Her son was enrolled in the same program as my sister and my dad didn\u2019t tell her until a week before it ended. Her kids found us on social media and reached out to us and showed up to our house unannounced. My dad waited days to tell us he was proposing to her. He waited a week before telling us her and her family were spending thanksgiving with us. By that point I moved out and my siblings spent the holiday with me at my place. Our dad waited four days prior to my sister coming home from campus to tell her this woman she had never formally met was already in the process of moving in. She lived with me for the summer and my brother stayed at his campus apartment, and we got an earful about how sad our dad was not to have his kids around him. \n\nWe don\u2019t like spending holidays with him. We rarely talk to him anymore but my siblings still have to be reliant on him. It\u2019s now been four years, and I truly and wholeheartedly believe that we could have worked things out with him and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family had things been different. But time and time again it feels like he does whatever he wants and we have to play catch-up. There\u2019s no emotional work on his end despite us explicitly communicating how all of this has made us feel. But somehow he\u2019s still dumbfounded when we\u2019d rather spend the holidays with our mom\u2019s relatives. \n\nThis is all to say, NTA. Those kids desperately need someone in their corner and, as his brother, you did wonderfully in stepping up for them.
