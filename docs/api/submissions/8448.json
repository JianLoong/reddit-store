I guess it really boils down to what/how much stuff he is being precious about, as everyone has different standards, and what some might call meticulous, others would call pedantic. \n\nI think most important, is the fact that the list of things he wants you to adhere to is making you feel uncomfortable, and he needs to decide whether avoiding a few minor nicks around the house is more important than his significant other being happy - which obviously it shouldn't be.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.  Wanting to take care of one's \"stuff\" is one thing.  Worried that a knife will fall apart because you're using it to crush garlic is crazy.    Relationships are about give and take and tolerance.  Even though you've been living together for 2 years it sounds like you are treated like a less than welcome houseguest.    Why do you put up with it?", "NTA. It's called home repair. Homes get lived in, they get dents and dings, you fix them before you sell the house. Dude's acting like any cosmetic damage to the house is permanent and irreparable and will \"devalue\" it FOREVER... And that's just weird.", "So I feel like the number of his demands has blurred the lines between reasonable and unreasonable ones, which is totally fair and to be expected. I say this because it is absolutely reasonable to not want you to put hot pots directly on the counter or sink, cuz they will get burned, and if its a nice kitchen knife he uses, it's reasonable for him to ask you to use it a certain way. But it is not reasonable for him to refuse to let you display anything in the home you live because it may \"scratch the surface\" of a sill.\n\nSo to address the devaluing argument of your boyfriends, living in a house will cause wear and tear, it is unavoidable. If there's anything the past few years should of taught people about housing value though, its that the condition of the house often plays very little role in its increase or decrease in value. Obviously a house you can live in will be more valuable than a house needing major repairs, but the land it sits on and where that land is in relation to other things (infrastructure, schools, jobs, highways, crime, etc) plays a much bigger role.\n\nI do think you need to have the \"what does the future hold\" convo with your boyfriend though, because if this is gonna be where you live long term, and especially if marriage is something you're considering, he has to understand it's your house too. If he's also expecting you to do the cooking, but then picky about how you use the knife, that's a serious no-no - you cannot dictate tasks to or expect tasks to be done by others, but then critique how those tasks are done.\n\nSo your boyfriend definitely sounds like he could just be an asshole, **but without more context I'm going to lean on NAH**, but suggest you might be incompatible, at least as roomies. Like I said, I think you need a convo about your future, but if he's not considering marriage, or if he sounds like he'll still treat it as \"his house\" when you are married, I'd end it, because you should be able to treat the space you live as your home.", "What was his financial status growing up? \n\nHe does sound obsessive with it. Any of the things mentioned you can easily fix when ready to sell. Most people end up having to do some of that. It would be very stressful to me with all those rules. I'm going NAH I guess because it is his home but also I can totally get how neurotic it is and how hard it would be to function there.", "Oh honey, it's not love when it's suffocating. \n\nHe loves his house more than you. So Leave.", "NTA. My SO is sort of this way . Is bothered if I get something on he granite countertop even though I use a cutting board. Is always following me around wiping counters and floors while I cooking (he doesn\u2019t cook). Gets upset if my old cat scratches the leather furniture I bought. His solution is to throw ugly blankets over it. I told him it as my couch and I\u2019d buy another one if I had to. Anyway I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way around this so you have to decide if this relationship is worth it to you, I\u2019m old so my perspective is a little different than yours. Good luck.", "NTA,  however,  you clearly knew these things and were niave about them and still chose to move in together.  There is some responsibility on you.   He's also not equally sharing his home.  There is a difference between respecting that its \"His\" home but you're both living there as equals and him treated you as a guest in his home who needs to follow all his rules and boundries while you get none.  I would find this as incompatible, therefore an end to the relationship.", "Sounds like he's a bit OCD. if you can't see yourself living with it continuously, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nNTA.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like both of you could benefit from better communication and a real long look at your shared values. \n\nHis need to control everything to extremes could be indicative of some deeper mental issues like compulsions or anxiety, OR he could just be someone who places a high value on organization and cleanliness. Neither of those makes him an asshole.\n\nHowever, if the living situation is clearly upsetting you then he should be open to communicating about your shared needs to find middle ground.  This is where couple's therapy could be helpful. If he isn't willing to listen to your concerns then he is showing you that he values control over a healthy relationship.\n\nIf you can't amicably reach a compromise then no amount of fighting over the same issues over and over will improve things. You'll just end up breeding resentment for one another.", "YTA, some of his concerns seem reasonable, some are a little overkill. But it is his home and you should me mindful of his property. The requests aren't that bad, you should just respect his wishes. Like if a friend lets you borrow a book and asks you not to fold over the page to save your spot even though you do that with your own books and don't think it's a big deal.\n\nThe actual issue sounds like the division of household labor is unfair and causing tension between you, and you guys need to address that.", "NTA. Sounds like your bf might have OCD.  If he isn't open to therapy, then you've got a preview of what the rest of your life with him looks like. Or worse, as his OCD might get more extreme.", "INFO:  Why do people stay in relationships when they're clearly not compatible or happy in them?  Is there some segment of society that is so terrified of being single they can't help themselves by falling into poor relationships?", "NTA if you think this is too much for you imagine what it would be like with a child and for a child. No future fun here\u2026.run", "NTA move out. For whatever reason he needs to have total control and until that changes this is just a boiling cauldron of trouble waiting to over flow with trouble.", "NAH. It's fine he wants his things treated a certain way and you're spending time in his house, but it sounds like his neuroticism is hurting your relationship and your ability to feel like it's your home too. That's the underlying issue that needs to be talked about - that you don't feel comfortable in the home you live in.", "NTA. Move out. This guy is \u2026dang, I don\u2019t even know what.", "Nta. Do you really want to live the rest of your life like this?", "NTA", "You're not wrong.  He's OCD maybe? One thing for certain, he's controlling and I spot a big red flag in front of him.  Time to go.", "NTA. This was a major factor in my marriage nearly ending several years ago. Some reasons for it: my spouse saw the stuff as HIS stuff and wanted to make sure I was careful enough with it (truth: we make about the same money and contribute equally). He really honestly cared that much about these things, and I didn't care as much. He thought I should care as much as he cared about how to hang towels on the rack or close the curtains... \n\nThis required counseling. It sounds silly, but it can destroy a relationship over time, and it won'tgo away on its own. \n\nNow, my go-to when he starts getting all demanding is, \"You can either do it yourself or you can leave it to me to do my way. You can't just watch me and complain.\"", "Thats a control freak.. Does he worry all the time.. Get a guy thats not controling like that.. But not a hoarder.. Find the middle ground.", "How can you be with someone like that? Imagine this person having kids and how miserable of a life that would be for you.", "Sounds like he has oc disorder. Walk away. It nevwr ends, and u dont want ur kids to have it", "I wouldn't be able to live like that. He's way too controlling.", "Nta - are you sure you two are compatible?", "NTA. If he is going to try to have this much control over the way you do everything, I would make him start doing all of it himself.", "You can improve how you treat the house with trivets for hot pans and coasters for potted plants and drinks. \nIf he expects you to clean up after him, get out.", "NTA. How have you managed to live with this guy for so long without going insane? Not only he\u2019s controlling and ridiculous but he treats you like you\u2019re just a guest and not someone who lives there. I don\u2019t know how you two arrange the bill paying but if you\u2019re living together you should feel like it\u2019s your home as well and not saying that it\u2019s ok because they are all \u201chis\u201d things.", "NTA. Why are you with this man?? He sounds like an anal controlling dictator. Is this really how you want to live your life???", "He\u2019s autistic not an insult its the truth", "NTA move out. You don't need someone to monitor every thing you do", "NTA but y t a for staying with a man who is annoying as shit. I remember my husband tried being nitpicky about shit like this after I broke something and he started watching everything I did and I got so angry at him. Like look, I\u2019m going to make mistakes and I\u2019m probably going to break something - it happens. I told him I\u2019d never damage anything on purpose and I take just as much pride in my home and my belongings as he does so he needs to get over himself. It caused a few too many arguments and I eventually blew up at him, I understood where he was coming from but he needed to understand where I was coming from. \n\nBut if he treats you like a guest instead of a live-in partner that\u2019s a whole other problem.", "Are you happy being an over-managed maid?\n\nNTA but come on. This isn\u2019t someone who can be a partner", "It's utterly bizarre. Unless your flailing the knife around like a drunken lumberjack, I fail to see how it will loosen the blade.", "This. And this will be your entire LIFE. NTA yet to anyone except yourself if you keep choosing to live this way.", "I talked to him before of how I have to tell him to clean up his own mess but he said we just had a different mess tolerence. Something for me is a mess doesn't neccessary is for him.", "Thank you for your reply,\nI will be careful with the counters \ud83d\ude31.\nHe's not actually a merticulous person or something like that. He's actually really messy. Never fold his clothes or wash his own dishes unless I tell him too. He likes to through things all over the place and I have to clean them up.\nI just don't know why he doesn't have the same standard for himself but only me.", "Right? It sounds so tiring. I want to come home and relax, not worry about the blade on a knife.", "It depends on the material. If it's laminate, then yes, but it's fine to do so on granite or Corian.", "My thoughts excactly. I get wanting to take good care of your house and things but one can go overboard. I'm like this with some of my things, but being in a relationship and living together is always a compromise.", "He has a pretty comfy childhood. Both of his parents are working in the medical industry so...", "If I had a bf like this, I'd be doing exactly that.", "Ohhhh, so he is a lazy control freak. Must be love.", "Wow, sounds awesome.", "So he\u2019s a lazy asshole. \n\nHis dirty dishes and piles of laundry have a higher likelihood of doing damage (bugs), than some fucking flower pots on a windowsill have. \n\nHe has these \u201cstandards\u201d for you, because it\u2019s easy for him. He gets to bark orders at you, while doing little to nothing himself.\n\nDo you want to live like this forever? My partner and I bought our first home a few months ago, and our \u201cdos/don\u2019ts\u201d are things like \u201cdon\u2019t let water sit on the hardwood floors,\u201d and \u201cturn the porch lights on at night.\u201d Not all this obsessive, controlling, bullshit. \n\nOwning a house and living with a partner should be an enjoyable experience. Not one where you feel like you\u2019re stepping on eggshells all the time.", "A scratch on a window/windowsill won't devalue a house, but bugs or mold from dirty clothes or dishes sitting around absolutely will. Your boyfriend is a hypocrite.\n\nIt sounds like he doesn't appreciate your contributions to the upkeep of the house at all, at the same time that he notices every tiny thing you do that \"might\" cause a barely perceptible degree of damage to something at some hypothetical point in the future (excluding the counters, which have already been addressed). Instead of showing appreciation, he's treating you like a liability. I know I couldn't live like that.\n\nEdit: NTA", "My SO is this way. Very messy but also really peculiar about certain objects and things.", "Jesus.", "Actually not okay on Corian, it'll discolor them. Same goes for quartz to a lesser extent.", "Interesting. Sounds like behaviors from someone who has had a very hard financial childhood. Or was given very little in terms of nice things. Being in medical industry doesn't necessarily mean having money. A lot of people waste a lot of money on bad decisions. I've known some who should be millionaires easily but are dirt broke for their bad choices.", "Lazy Control Freak has entered my lexicon. Thank you!", "And if you're looking at the long term with this guy - imagine a toddler in his house -gasp- touching things!", "Yeah - I picked up a \"walking on eggshells\" vibe from this post and really think OP ought to think once, twice, think about it again.... and then just run.\n\nBeing in a walking on eggshells situation will eventually suck the life out of you.", "I'm going soft NAH. \n\nHowever, I've lived with people whom you remind me of, arguing that because they were \"helping\" out, any damage they did was justified. Huge gouges in my floors; my countertops dinged and stained with permanent markers; fridge shelves broken; expensive knives chipped by being used as screwdrivers; plants destroyed when they tried to deadhead them; my hand mixer jammed and burned out because they couldn't put it together right and just let it keep running when it wasn't spinning; any book on my bookshelves; various electronics (setting things down on a tablet if I left it out for any length of time, burning in screens after I'd explained that you can't keep the same image open all day); the knobs on my stove ($50 EACH to replace!); packages they'd open and try to assemble, then tell me I could just apply a little super glue and it would be fine; essential oils stripping the finishes on my furniture; gouges in the walls because they wouldn't be careful moving furniture; silverware dropped down the garbage disposal (they had to remove my disposal protector to make that happen); and yes, damage to my window sills from pots being placed directly on the sill (they were welcome to have plants, I just wanted something under the pots to protect the finish). I could go on. All this in the space of a few years. Nothing in my home was too small for them to damage, and they never offered to make me whole. If I showed any sign of frustration, they'd justify it by complaining about how clutter-prone and materialistic I am.\n\nThey made the same excuses I'm seeing you make, that if I'd clean up after myself, they wouldn't \"have\" to break my stuff. No. Leaving a pot to soak overnight or not folding my laundry the minute the dryer runs is nothing like the same. They refused to stop \"helping,\" while boasting to all their friends and family how they were enabling me. When I added up what they'd cost me during their tenure, it was in the thousands of dollars. In the years since they left, I've had no major damage to my home. I've lost several plates and shrunk two blouses in the dryer.

Because he is speaking to her like you would speak to a child who doesn't know better. I cannot judge without knowing what she is doing to his stuff/house. \n\nThere is an art to living so you don't create more work or expense for yourself, and most people learn these things as they grow up. Perhaps she never learned.", "I have a farm, so not sensible to have carpets. They would be trashed! We have very old hardwood floors. Not at all pristine. \n\nNot sure he knows about plant care so he may have said \"no plants\" instead of knowing to suggest a tray. She could start a conversation about it and suggest a solution that would make them both happy. Has she?\n\nAs for the counters, he should have told her where to place hot pots and pans. Is she ignoring that? Not enough info. I assume he taught her how to correctly use the car windows and window blinds. Touching monitor screens is my pet peeve and they never seem to get clean once someone smears their fingers on them so I understand his anger. There is just no reason to touch them. \n\nHe shouldn't just yell at her obviously; he should instruct her how to care for things properly so she can learn. Maybe he is just entirely fed up with her carelessness and they need to break things off? I would be pretty frustrated to find my stuff ruined for no reason, over and over again.", "He\u2019s definitely a butthole. The worst I\u2019ve done to my counters with that is a little staining from turmeric, which still comes off with a little extra effort and/or time. Nothing that\u2019s gonna \u201cdevalue\u201d the house for sure!!", "I read your statement as accepting the risk and replacing it if it happens.", "I didn't ever say it should be", "I was just saying what it breaking it would mean"]}
