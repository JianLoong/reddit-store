I guess it really boils down to what/how much stuff he is being precious about, as everyone has different standards, and what some might call meticulous, others would call pedantic. \n\nI think most important, is the fact that the list of things he wants you to adhere to is making you feel uncomfortable, and he needs to decide whether avoiding a few minor nicks around the house is more important than his significant other being happy - which obviously it shouldn't be.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.  Wanting to take care of one's \"stuff\" is one thing.  Worried that a knife will fall apart because you're using it to crush garlic is crazy.    Relationships are about give and take and tolerance.  Even though you've been living together for 2 years it sounds like you are treated like a less than welcome houseguest.    Why do you put up with it?", "NTA. It's called home repair. Homes get lived in, they get dents and dings, you fix them before you sell the house. Dude's acting like any cosmetic damage to the house is permanent and irreparable and will \"devalue\" it FOREVER... And that's just weird.", "So I feel like the number of his demands has blurred the lines between reasonable and unreasonable ones, which is totally fair and to be expected. I say this because it is absolutely reasonable to not want you to put hot pots directly on the counter or sink, cuz they will get burned, and if its a nice kitchen knife he uses, it's reasonable for him to ask you to use it a certain way. But it is not reasonable for him to refuse to let you display anything in the home you live because it may \"scratch the surface\" of a sill.\n\nSo to address the devaluing argument of your boyfriends, living in a house will cause wear and tear, it is unavoidable. If there's anything the past few years should of taught people about housing value though, its that the condition of the house often plays very little role in its increase or decrease in value. Obviously a house you can live in will be more valuable than a house needing major repairs, but the land it sits on and where that land is in relation to other things (infrastructure, schools, jobs, highways, crime, etc) plays a much bigger role.\n\nI do think you need to have the \"what does the future hold\" convo with your boyfriend though, because if this is gonna be where you live long term, and especially if marriage is something you're considering, he has to understand it's your house too. If he's also expecting you to do the cooking, but then picky about how you use the knife, that's a serious no-no - you cannot dictate tasks to or expect tasks to be done by others, but then critique how those tasks are done.\n\nSo your boyfriend definitely sounds like he could just be an asshole, **but without more context I'm going to lean on NAH**, but suggest you might be incompatible, at least as roomies. Like I said, I think you need a convo about your future, but if he's not considering marriage, or if he sounds like he'll still treat it as \"his house\" when you are married, I'd end it, because you should be able to treat the space you live as your home.", "What was his financial status growing up? \n\nHe does sound obsessive with it. Any of the things mentioned you can easily fix when ready to sell. Most people end up having to do some of that. It would be very stressful to me with all those rules. I'm going NAH I guess because it is his home but also I can totally get how neurotic it is and how hard it would be to function there.", "Oh honey, it's not love when it's suffocating. \n\nHe loves his house more than you. So Leave.", "NTA. My SO is sort of this way . Is bothered if I get something on he granite countertop even though I use a cutting board. Is always following me around wiping counters and floors while I cooking (he doesn\u2019t cook). Gets upset if my old cat scratches the leather furniture I bought. His solution is to throw ugly blankets over it. I told him it as my couch and I\u2019d buy another one if I had to. Anyway I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way around this so you have to decide if this relationship is worth it to you, I\u2019m old so my perspective is a little different than yours. Good luck.", "NTA,  however,  you clearly knew these things and were niave about them and still chose to move in together.  There is some responsibility on you.   He's also not equally sharing his home.  There is a difference between respecting that its \"His\" home but you're both living there as equals and him treated you as a guest in his home who needs to follow all his rules and boundries while you get none.  I would find this as incompatible, therefore an end to the relationship.", "Sounds like he's a bit OCD. if you can't see yourself living with it continuously, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nNTA.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like both of you could benefit from better communication and a real long look at your shared values. \n\nHis need to control everything to extremes could be indicative of some deeper mental issues like compulsions or anxiety, OR he could just be someone who places a high value on organization and cleanliness. Neither of those makes him an asshole.\n\nHowever, if the living situation is clearly upsetting you then he should be open to communicating about your shared needs to find middle ground.  This is where couple's therapy could be helpful. If he isn't willing to listen to your concerns then he is showing you that he values control over a healthy relationship.\n\nIf you can't amicably reach a compromise then no amount of fighting over the same issues over and over will improve things. You'll just end up breeding resentment for one another.", "YTA, some of his concerns seem reasonable, some are a little overkill. But it is his home and you should me mindful of his property. The requests aren't that bad, you should just respect his wishes. Like if a friend lets you borrow a book and asks you not to fold over the page to save your spot even though you do that with your own books and don't think it's a big deal.\n\nThe actual issue sounds like the division of household labor is unfair and causing tension between you, and you guys need to address that.", "NTA. Sounds like your bf might have OCD.  If he isn't open to therapy, then you've got a preview of what the rest of your life with him looks like. Or worse, as his OCD might get more extreme.", "INFO:  Why do people stay in relationships when they're clearly not compatible or happy in them?  Is there some segment of society that is so terrified of being single they can't help themselves by falling into poor relationships?", "NTA if you think this is too much for you imagine what it would be like with a child and for a child. No future fun here\u2026.run", "NTA move out. For whatever reason he needs to have total control and until that changes this is just a boiling cauldron of trouble waiting to over flow with trouble.", "NAH. It's fine he wants his things treated a certain way and you're spending time in his house, but it sounds like his neuroticism is hurting your relationship and your ability to feel like it's your home too. That's the underlying issue that needs to be talked about - that you don't feel comfortable in the home you live in.", "NTA. Move out. This guy is \u2026dang, I don\u2019t even know what.", "Nta. Do you really want to live the rest of your life like this?", "NTA", "You're not wrong.  He's OCD maybe? One thing for certain, he's controlling and I spot a big red flag in front of him.  Time to go.", "NTA. This was a major factor in my marriage nearly ending several years ago. Some reasons for it: my spouse saw the stuff as HIS stuff and wanted to make sure I was careful enough with it (truth: we make about the same money and contribute equally). He really honestly cared that much about these things, and I didn't care as much. He thought I should care as much as he cared about how to hang towels on the rack or close the curtains... \n\nThis required counseling. It sounds silly, but it can destroy a relationship over time, and it won'tgo away on its own. \n\nNow, my go-to when he starts getting all demanding is, \"You can either do it yourself or you can leave it to me to do my way. You can't just watch me and complain.\"", "Thats a control freak.. Does he worry all the time.. Get a guy thats not controling like that.. But not a hoarder.. Find the middle ground.", "How can you be with someone like that? Imagine this person having kids and how miserable of a life that would be for you.", "Sounds like he has oc disorder. Walk away. It nevwr ends, and u dont want ur kids to have it", "I wouldn't be able to live like that. He's way too controlling.", "Nta - are you sure you two are compatible?", "NTA. If he is going to try to have this much control over the way you do everything, I would make him start doing all of it himself.", "You can improve how you treat the house with trivets for hot pans and coasters for potted plants and drinks. \nIf he expects you to clean up after him, get out.", "NTA. How have you managed to live with this guy for so long without going insane? Not only he\u2019s controlling and ridiculous but he treats you like you\u2019re just a guest and not someone who lives there. I don\u2019t know how you two arrange the bill paying but if you\u2019re living together you should feel like it\u2019s your home as well and not saying that it\u2019s ok because they are all \u201chis\u201d things.", "NTA. Why are you with this man?? He sounds like an anal controlling dictator. Is this really how you want to live your life???", "He\u2019s autistic not an insult its the truth", "NTA move out. You don't need someone to monitor every thing you do", "NTA but y t a for staying with a man who is annoying as shit. I remember my husband tried being nitpicky about shit like this after I broke something and he started watching everything I did and I got so angry at him. Like look, I\u2019m going to make mistakes and I\u2019m probably going to break something - it happens. I told him I\u2019d never damage anything on purpose and I take just as much pride in my home and my belongings as he does so he needs to get over himself. It caused a few too many arguments and I eventually blew up at him, I understood where he was coming from but he needed to understand where I was coming from. \n\nBut if he treats you like a guest instead of a live-in partner that\u2019s a whole other problem.", "Are you happy being an over-managed maid?\n\nNTA but come on. This isn\u2019t someone who can be a partner", "It's utterly bizarre. Unless your flailing the knife around like a drunken lumberjack, I fail to see how it will loosen the blade.", "This. And this will be your entire LIFE. NTA yet to anyone except yourself if you keep choosing to live this way.", "I talked to him before of how I have to tell him to clean up his own mess but he said we just had a different mess tolerence. Something for me is a mess doesn't neccessary is for him.", "Thank you for your reply,\nI will be careful with the counters \ud83d\ude31.\nHe's not actually a merticulous person or something like that. He's actually really messy. Never fold his clothes or wash his own dishes unless I tell him too. He likes to through things all over the place and I have to clean them up.\nI just don't know why he doesn't have the same standard for himself but only me.", "Right? It sounds so tiring. I want to come home and relax, not worry about the blade on a knife.", "It depends on the material. If it's laminate, then yes, but it's fine to do so on granite or Corian.", "My thoughts excactly. I get wanting to take good care of your house and things but one can go overboard. I'm like this with some of my things, but being in a relationship and living together is always a compromise.", "He has a pretty comfy childhood. Both of his parents are working in the medical industry so...", "If I had a bf like this, I'd be doing exactly that.", "Ohhhh, so he is a lazy control freak. Must be love.", "Wow, sounds awesome.", "So he\u2019s a lazy asshole. \n\nHis dirty dishes and piles of laundry have a higher likelihood of doing damage (bugs), than some fucking flower pots on a windowsill have. \n\nHe has these \u201cstandards\u201d for you, because it\u2019s easy for him. He gets to bark orders at you, while doing little to nothing himself.\n\nDo you want to live like this forever?

Not one where you feel like you\u2019re stepping on eggshells all the time.", "A scratch on a window/windowsill won't devalue a house, but bugs or mold from dirty clothes or dishes sitting around absolutely will. Your boyfriend is a hypocrite.\n\nIt sounds like he doesn't appreciate your contributions to the upkeep of the house at all, at the same time that he notices every tiny thing you do that \"might\" cause a barely perceptible degree of damage to something at some hypothetical point in the future (excluding the counters, which have already been addressed). Instead of showing appreciation, he's treating you like a liability. I know I couldn't live like that.\n\nEdit: NTA", "My SO is this way.

Sounds like behaviors from someone who has had a very hard financial childhood. Or was given very little in terms of nice things. Being in medical industry doesn't necessarily mean having money. A lot of people waste a lot of money on bad decisions. I've known some who should be millionaires easily but are dirt broke for their bad choices.", "Lazy Control Freak has entered my lexicon. Thank you!", "And if you're looking at the long term with this guy - imagine a toddler in his house -gasp- touching things!", "Yeah - I picked up a \"walking on eggshells\" vibe from this post and really think OP ought to think once, twice, think about it again.... and then just run.\n\nBeing in a walking on eggshells situation will eventually suck the life out of you.", "I'm going soft NAH. \n\nHowever, I've lived with people whom you remind me of, arguing that because they were \"helping\" out, any damage they did was justified. Huge gouges in my floors; my countertops dinged and stained with permanent markers; fridge shelves broken; expensive knives chipped by being used as screwdrivers; plants destroyed when they tried to deadhead them; my hand mixer jammed and burned out because they couldn't put it together right and just let it keep running when it wasn't spinning; any book on my bookshelves; various electronics (setting things down on a tablet if I left it out for any length of time, burning in screens after I'd explained that you can't keep the same image open all day); the knobs on my stove ($50 EACH to replace!); packages they'd open and try to assemble, then tell me I could just apply a little super glue and it would be fine; essential oils stripping the finishes on my furniture; gouges in the walls because they wouldn't be careful moving furniture; silverware dropped down the garbage disposal (they had to remove my disposal protector to make that happen); and yes, damage to my window sills from pots being placed directly on the sill (they were welcome to have plants, I just wanted something under the pots to protect the finish). I could go on. All this in the space of a few years. Nothing in my home was too small for them to damage, and they never offered to make me whole. If I showed any sign of frustration, they'd justify it by complaining about how clutter-prone and materialistic I am.\n\nThey made the same excuses I'm seeing you make, that if I'd clean up after myself, they wouldn't \"have\" to break my stuff. No. Leaving a pot to soak overnight or not folding my laundry the minute the dryer runs is nothing like the same. They refused to stop \"helping,\" while boasting to all their friends and family how they were enabling me. When I added up what they'd cost me during their tenure, it was in the thousands of dollars. In the years since they left, I've had no major damage to my home. I've lost several plates and shrunk two blouses in the dryer. Everything else I've had to do is routine maintenance, like cleaning gutters.\n\nIf the rules are growing, he's probably getting tired of you breaking his stuff.", "So I'm \ud83d\udcaf against any kind of \"armchair diagnosing\" but holy hell do a lot of these sound like Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder traits.

This is your life.. is it worth it ?", "YTA it\u2019s easy not to care about something being damaged if you\u2019re not the one paying for it. Unless if he doesn\u2019t follow his own rules, in which case I would say e s h.", "NTA. Okay, your boyfriend could be my dad, just 60 years younger. This is no way to live. I'm not saying break windows and punch holes in walls, but life is messy; houses get dirty, walls get scratched and glass will get covered with finger prints. It is all fixable, cleanable and replaceable. It is good to take care of your things, but within reason. He isn't going to change. Your love may be strong, but do you want to live in a police state for the rest of your life?", "NTA, but you two should probably just break up. Doesn't sound like you like each other. Maybe his endless list of rules is him trying to get you to leave him.", "Yeah that is wild. My partner who values his belongings, is a chef and therefore has expensive knives even crushes the garlic like that.", "Right? Imagine saying that to someone who is cooking you dinner!!?!! He\u2019s a weenie.", "I mean, I have a little pasta shaped tube to get the papery stuff off garlic and a companion bowl to grate it in but what are you supposed to crush garlic with? \n\nIf you have crazy expensive knives, then sure but use an ordinary knife. Just looked it up and you can use a can or jar of food. No doubt he'd object based on damage to cutting board or counter", "Agreed NTA, but it sounds like the boyfriend may have some form of OCD. Hence, he needs things done his way. Either way, in the long run, it'll make life very difficult for the OP.", "And if it would, just put something under it! FFS, get peel-and-stick felt pads and stick them to the bottom of the flower pots!", "It's not the scratches, it's the water damage from trapped water under the pots and condensations\n\nOur apartment has wooden windowsills and it's in our lease that we cannot grow plants directly on the windowsill or we'll be fined.", "I have not read all the responses but this is the first one I seen so far to mention something along the lines of him having some sort of a problem.\n I would say NAH also just because different people may have different priorities of keeping their house in order.  It bring his place so I think his say goes. You can either discuss it with him and see if there is room to budge. Otherwise, maybe if this is going to be a point of contention, find someone else I guess. Neither of you are wrong.", "I wanted to say this too. Setting hot items on the counter is really careless behavior unless you have a countertop made of material you know can take extreme heat. \n\nWhile most of the boyfriend's issues are over the top, it sounds like op might be more on the reckless side, so kind of a clashing personality pairing.", "It depends on the type of counters. Hot pans will 100% destroy Formica. Theyre fine on granite.", "Where I\u2019m caught is that she said she can\u2019t put hot LIDS on the counter. Unless it was in the oven or something, lids aren\u2019t normally getting and then staying hot enough to damage the counter top. So I\u2019m thinking she\u2019s not even putting stuff straight from the oven/stove directly on the counter and leaving it, but when it\u2019s still warm but touchable", "Then that's what you need to tell him when you put a pan lid on the sink, or a plant pot on a windowsill - we just have different tolerances for what is normal wear and tear on a house.\n\nUnless he is selling in the next 6 months it's shouldn't be pristine. You have to clear up after him and he gets to control what you do down to the minutiae? Nope!\n\nNTA", "I got exhausted just reading it. I can't imagine living it.", "Being around someone with OCD is exhausting and not something to be taken on lightly. Does anyone else in his family have OCD?", "Okay, but...you can put a tray underneath or something. You have to be able to *live* in your house. And there is going to be some wear and tear from just living your life.", "On the other hand, I just moved out of a place where I'd been storing plants on the windowsill for years.  \n\nWas there some water damage? Yes. Did it affect the value of the house? Not after a quick sanding and a fresh coat of paint, no.\n\nOP's boyfriend doesn't seem to understand the concept of fixing things.", "He has different standards because this is about control not about the value of the house.", "Okay, so he's just a controlling jerk. He doesn't actually care about his belongings, he just cares about telling you what to do.", "Just buy a few trivets. They have silicone mats you can plop on the counter before putting a pot or a pan on it. Same with putting felt on the base of the pots or covering them up with fabric. \n\nThere are solutions to every *real* problem, and some of the made up ones. The issue is that he has SO MANY problems. My rule of thumb is, if there isn\u2019t a gadget on Amazon to fix it, it isn\u2019t a normal problem.", "He is really obsessed with the value of things depreciating. Dis he grow up in a family with money issues or an intensely frugal family?  He may not realize his behavior is extreme. But obviously NTA", "You should edit this into the original post, because its very relevant. Took me from NAH to NTA. If he can't apply the same level of care to himself, he's just being a control freak.", "Girl MARINA flags!!! So you have all these rules you need to follow but he gets to be as sloppy as he wants?!! Get out, life doesn\u2019t have to be this hard!", "NTA but if you are paying him rent stop cooking and cleaning for him. You also need to decide if this is how you want to live your life.", "Not OK on either of those materials. Both are susceptible to cracking due to thermal shock", "I don't know it's actually a problem, but I never put any of this stuff on my counter. It's so easy to either leave it on the stove, put it in the sink or, if I'm really put of room, put a cutting board down first.", "Not folding laundry has zero impact on the home's value. Pest control can manage bugs if he gets them, maybe $150-200. Replacing countertops or window ledges because they're damaged can be thousands of dollars. OP frontloaded the trivial stuff, like the knives. Though if he has expensive knives, being protective of them is also not entirely unreasonable. Criticizing his habits that don't damage his stuff is a misdirection so OP can feel better about not respecting his possessions.", "I'm surprised. I had it in my old house and never had an issue.", "Whew, be glad they've missed you before today\ud83d\ude02 nothing is worse", "The house will almost certainly need those things updated or refreshed before it\u2019s sold anyways. \n\nUnless it\u2019s stone or butcher block counters, they will most likely need replaced. The windowsills should be repainted before the house is listed as well. \n\nBugs are not a \u201c$150-$200\u201d issue, nor are they an easy fix. \n\nYou *should* expect to spend thousands updating and refreshing your home *(on the types of things mentioned in this post! Paint, countertops, flooring, etc)* if you wish to get the most money back. And frankly, it doesn\u2019t even sound like he has a guideline on when or *if* he plans on selling. Obviously she shouldn\u2019t intentionally damage things, but it\u2019s fucking hilarious to act like flower pots are a bigger issue than dirty dishes, and things thrown around.", "Heat on stone countertops is one of those \"small chance, high damage\" situations. People can and do put pans directly on countertops without issue, but it can melt the acrylic in engineered stone or ignite the air pockets in natural stone, causing shock damage. Almost any stone company will also put an exception to their warranty for this.\n\nTLDR: It's rare but can happen, and if it does you'll have to replace the slab.", "If you're ready to sell everything is damaged, you have to update it. If it's outdated, you can prioritize what to update.", "Exactly. 1/10k chance, but if it happens, buy a new slab", "You don\u2019t have to update or repair anything to sell. It\u2019s literally only done for profit. \n\nCurrent house came with damaged flooring, an oven that didn\u2019t work, a water heater that wasn\u2019t up to code, and some outside damage. And sure, we got $10k off the listing price because of it, but they still sold, and made a profit.", "You think she's going to buy a new slab if she destroys it?", "You were the one making the argument you do.", "I was agreeing not to put hot shit on counters?", "That doesn\u2019t change much. \n\nYes, it\u2019s always recommended you do basic shit like paint before selling. \n\nBut if you can\u2019t afford it, like what you\u2019re implying with the whole \u201cprioritize what to update,\u201d then you don\u2019t *have* to.", "You said if you hit the odds on the bad thing happening, you buy a new one. I don't disagree. I just don't think the risk, however small, should be borne by the BF when he's asking her not to do it.", "No. You said you \"have\" to update everything anyway so damage doesn't matter. I said if you take care of it, you \"have\" to update only what you choose."]}
