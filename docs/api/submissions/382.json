The baby is also the first grandchild/nephew of my husband's family which everyone is excited about.\n\n I lost my mother and father to the pandemic, being an only child, so there's not much of my family. Since the death of my parents (1 year ago), my husband's family has welcomed me with open arms as part of them and I have become very close to my MIL and SIL. \n\nI always wanted to have a gender reveal and I trusted my SIL to organize everything about this.\n\nWith 3 days to go before the party, I started to receive messages from all my husband's relatives and even close friends congratulating me on my baby being a boy. \n\nI went to ask what happened, my SIL confessed that she let it slip to my MIL and she told everyone the sex of the baby after knowing, because she couldn't hold it and it took proportions beyond what they imagined. Nobody call me to tell this. \n\nThe party was canceled and I was heartbroken, as well as extremely hurt by the two of them.\n\n Usually they accompanied me to the ultrasound, shopping for the baby' room and my MIL would stay at the time of delivery. \n\nBut after this breach of trust, I stopped inviting them and asked them to respect my boundaries when they pressured me to go. Honestly, I didn't even send them the baby shower invite, because I really avoided contact with them as much as possible. Because everyone knew before me that it was a boy. \n\nMy husband started complaining that I was pushing them away because of a mistake that could happen and that I was being harsh. \n\nYesterday he brought up this and when I said that I still didn't feel comfortable with them, he said \"Soon you'll tell me that my mother won't be able to go to the birth \".\n\n I think my face showed my response and he started saying I was being too hard on her because she was just excited and blabla. \n\nI had my limit and said, \"If you keep pushing me, it won't just be your mother who won't be on my labor. So either stop or you won't come in.\" \n\nHe started to say that I was crossing lines and that he had a right to have this moment. I was taking this with  them too far. \n\nHe slept on the couch and doesn't talk to me more than necessary. \n\nAITA?\n\nWell, many are saying it's just a gender reveal. I honestly don't care for that and I think it's tacky, but my mom was the type who like/love it and she always dreamed of having grandchildren, she said she was made to be a grandmother. She can't meet my son or even know I'm pregnant, so I wanted to do something tacky that I don't care for her, not for me. Everyone knew the importance and the reason. I always wanted to have a gender reveal with my mom there  and I didn't have either.\n\nExtra:\n\nLet's go to some points:\n\n - At no time did I say that I would never approach them again. But RIGHT NOW, I don't see myself doing that. I already have grief, pregnancy hormones, and day-to-day stress to deal with so I don't want anything else to bother me. \n\n- Obviously I want my husband to be in childbirth. But it's a lot of stress, he brings this topic all the time and I doubt he'll stop even at the time of my delivery trying to convince me. Even if he goes, if he says anything about his mother coming, I'll ask him to leave.", "created_utc": 1667080991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygw927/aita_for_uninviting_my_sil_and_mil_from/", "score": 16031, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's like people forget that you are a person going through that and in that moment you're a loud incubator.\n\nFwiw, when I went into labor- I told no one until about a day after when we were all in the clear. It was amazing and stress free!", "Nta.. she is a whole ass adult who could have kept her mouth shut, or Apologized even she screwed up.  She didn't.  She wanted to steal your moment.

It's not just about a gender reveal. It's releasing private information given by a doctor to a person OP designated and that information was then made widely available to a group of people without OP's knowledge.

By pushing the blame onto you for your reaction, he's not being a very good partner to you.

Amazing they were just planning to go forward with the party and face no consequences. \n\nThat\u2019s not what happened, though, so these are the consequences. They\u2019re just going to have to deal and so is your husband. There\u2019s no reason for someone to be in the delivery room if you\u2019re not comfortable around them.

That was until she started a fight with his grandparents and us because she was jealous they were so close to me and loved me. She came to my home at 3 months along, after I had just thrown up my breakfast and was hooked to a heart monitor for complications, and got in my face and screamed at me for nothing. She was uninvited right then and there from the birth and we didn\u2019t speak for months. To be honest, as important as a gender reveal is, for everyone to know but you is complete bullshit.

I mean, I guess it works for some people, but it\u2019s certainly not the default or even a somewhat common thing. \n\nIt\u2019s a strange boundary to cross, imo. Maybe she has been there for all the big moments in his life, but this is him starting his own family. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable for grandma to meet the baby AFTER the delivery. It can be a profoundly emotional and intimate moment for a couple. I don\u2019t know why anyone other than the partner would expect to be there except at the mother\u2019s wishes and invitation. If you want her there to support YOU that\u2019s one thing. If she wants to be there just bc of the baby- she can wait in the waiting room. \n\nGiving birth isn\u2019t like your wedding day.

I am so sorry for your huge loss! \n\nOf course you would love to find more family support in your in-laws, but it appears that they are not trustworthy. It seems no one in your life is giving you the emotional support that you need both for your pregnancy and your grief. Even your husband is telling you how you should feel and what you should do, and he is making demands and dumping expectations on you. None of this is okay. What your husband's family did in going behind your back to share most intimate knowledge, and then refusing to even apologize is unacceptable. \n\nNow your husband, who should be supporting you in these life events, both death and birth at the same time, instead he is sulking, pouting, demanding and requiring you to behave just as he imagines you should.

This is really a terrible moment for you. \n\nIf I were you, rather than turning to the internet, I would be seeking professional help and guidance.

You have choices.", "NTA. \n\nTo be honest, I don't think this was really a threat to your husband. You needed him to know that you don't want added pressure from him when you're in labour, which is totally fair. Maybe it could have been communicated more clearly, but he has gone straight to sulking rather than taking the time to learn more about why this is so important to you.\n\nMIL & SIL's actions cost you a moment in your first pregnancy that was very significant to you - it doesn't matter what anyone else on here thinks of reveal parties.\n\nMoreso MIL & SIL have also placed themselves in the centre of this news - you were among the last to know. Of course that is going to sting. It shows, at the very least, a lack of thought about your wants for your pregnancy journey. That is enough reason to set the boundaries that you have. \n\nThe ball is in their court to begin making reparations to this relationship. They stepped back their respect so you've stepped back their involvement. You've not cut out the relationship, you've readjusted your boundaries after they overstepped, which is exactly what is needed given their lack of remorse.", "NTA\n\nThey both made a choice to not respect you by telling everyone the gender knowing that you wanted a gender reveal.\n\nYour husband sucks for trying to pressure you.

Giving birth is not the place where you want your MIL. Trust me. It's extremely personal and you will be at your most vulnerable. In my experience, having my husband there was a godsend. You need someone you can trust with you.

Since the death of my parents (1 year ago), my husband's family has welcomed me with open arms as part of them and I have become very close to my MIL and SIL. \n\nI always wanted to have a gender reveal and I trusted my SIL to organize everything about this.\n\nWith 3 days to go before the party, I started to receive messages from all my husband's relatives and even close friends congratulating me on my baby being a boy. \n\nI went to ask what had happened, my SIL confessed that she let it slip to my MIL and she told everyone the sex of the baby after knowing, because she couldn't hold it and it took proportions beyond what they imagined. Nobody call me to tell this. \n\nThe party was canceled and I was heartbroken, as well as extremely hurt by the two of them.\n\n Usually they accompanied me to the ultrasound, shopping for the baby' room and my MIL would stay at the time of delivery. \n\nBut after this breach of trust, I stopped inviting them and asked them to respect my boundaries when they pressured me to go. Honestly, I didn't even send them the baby shower invite, because I really avoided contact with them as much as possible. Because everyone knew before me that it was a boy. \n\nMy husband started complaining that I was pushing them away because of a mistake that could happen and that I was being harsh. \n\nYesterday he brought up this and when I said that I still didn't feel comfortable with them, he said \"Soon you'll tell me that my mother won't be able to go to the birth \".\n\n I think my face showed my response and he started saying I was being too hard on her because she was just excited and blabla. \n\nI had my limit and said, \"If you keep pushing me, it won't just be your mother who won't be on my labor. So either stop or you won't come in.\" \n\nHe started to say that I was crossing lines and that he had a right to have this moment. I was taking this with  them too far. \n\nHe slept on the couch and doesn't talk to me more than necessary. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019ve had an otherwise good relationship with MIL & SIL, so if I were you, I would absolutely talk to them more deeply about your feelings. Through their own excitement they selfishly, ruined a special moment you were looking forward to. It was innocent and ignorant but selfish and hurtful. They weren\u2019t thinking about how this might hurt you they just wanted to be able to share the news not thinking about the consequences. Hopefully they can apologize and I would encourage you to forgive them. People get crazy about baby stuff and seem to easily ignore that this is also a special time for the new mother, yet she often gets overlooked as just the vessel in which the new baby arrives. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, but I think you can overcome this. Moving forward keep SIL & MIL on an info diet. Your husband is totally out of line, btw. I nearly spit out my beverage when I read how he thinks his MIL is going to be in the delivery room (no offense if that is your plan), but his comments in general are ridiculous.", "NTA.", "NTA, your MIL went waaaay too far.  I can't imagine why anyone would want their MIL (or mother) in their delivery room with them, however, you will want your husband.  IMO having a delivery alone, without your partner present, would be tough.  And starting your family, without your husband there at the start, is a mistake - one he is unlikely to get over.", "You can still have the party - change it to a Gender Known and celebrate your baby and mom. Have an activity where people do things to guess the gender and it\u2019s always boy. \n\nI understand your frustration and disappointment, but you can still salvage it. \n\nCongratulations on your little!", "I can think of very FEW reasons for MIL to be there for labor anyway!!\n\nNTA and kick your husband out too if he gets too pushy. He should be supporting your wishes in this, not his mommy's", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry this happy moment was taken away from you. Condolences on the loss of your parents who I\u2019m sure you\u2019re really missing right now. Virtual hugs from this internet stranger.", "NTA.  \n\nNO. He does not have that right.  YOU have a right to have people in your Delivery room who have YOUR interests at heart. \n\nMIL and SIL need to provide you with a meaningful apology without expectation that this will suddenly make you want them present for things.  \n\nHusband needs to get his shit together.", "NTA. A hell of a lot of families seem to be able to pull off gender reveals without someone slipping. Thus want some monumental task that SIL undertook. Screw these people.", "NTA. Child birth is just so damn personal, and should be enjoyed only by those that you trust this is such a major breech of that trust that I\u2019m mad for you. I\u2019d be livid and inconsolable. You do, however, need to at the very least rebuild that connection with your husband. He should be present. Everyone else, girl, that\u2019s up to you. Screw them. But definitely try to make amends with your husband.", "It takes a lot of trust to let a person be with you in your most vulnerable moment. Your SIL and MIL have violated that trust. Furthermore your husband is proving that he doesn\u2019t have your back which is super important too in your most vulnerable moment. It\u2019s your body and you get to decide who will be in the delivery room. \n\nNTA", "NTA. MIL will continue to run right over anything you want if you do not put your foot down now.", "NTA", "NTA. Childbirth is an incredibly vulnerable time. You need to be 100% comfortable with the people you choose because so many things are beyond your control.  It\u2019s not for spectators- those in the room have the responsibility for making sure you have the support you need for this major medical procedure.", "NTA. I hope you and your husband realize that you are still dealing with a lot of grief. It wasn't that long ago and big events like the birth of your first child are really going to make you feel the loss that much more. You wanted to feel like your new family had your back like your mom and dad did, and they just let you down. I hope you and your husband can find a way back to each other through all this grief.", "NTA. It\u2019s your baby and you say what goes. Your husband is a partner in it but when you drew boundaries they breached those. He needs to have your back. He is belittling your feelings. Just as they would legally have no rights to the child, so are they not entitled to anything related to said child without your permission.", "NTA. They made choices. Your husband should be 100% on your side. Period. Done.  The fact that he isn\u2019t is a problem.", "NTA. A mistake is knocking over a glass or forgetting an appointment. These were choices. SIL chose to tell MIL. MIL chose to tell others. \n\nI think telling your husband he won't be able to come to your delivery was going a bit too far, but I understand why you said it. Maybe consider apologizing to him and reassuring him that you need his support. But reiterate that these were not mistakes on MIL and SIL's part, they were choices. There are consequences. And the birth of your child is your medical procedure and no one else's. If you aren't comfortable with MIL there that's your decision and you expect his support.", "This wasn\u2019t a mistake. This was intentional. She wanted the moment. Your moment. Please use this as an example of how they can/will act in the future. \n\nYou are being smart here. Set boundaries and enforce consequences now, so they know you mean business. \n\n\nYour husband should be as offended as you. He should also support your decisions on whoever you want or do not want in the room. \n\nDon\u2019t back down. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019d be asking why his mother is more important during your pregnancy than you are", "NTA \n\nThe whole point of a gender reveal party is to NOT KNOW UNTIL THE PARTY. Ugh, they took that surprise from you, and whether it was out of malicious intent or not, it was supposed to be a secret and it got out. \n\nYour MIL and SIL are old enough to understand the consequences of their actions. They know well enough what blabbing a secret does. \n\nAs for your husband, he should be backing you on this, and you are n the right for putting your foot down. You\u2019re pregnant for christs sake. You\u2019re most certainly not the asshole.", "NTA but it sounds like you married a momma\u2019s boy", "NTA. Ask any L&D nurse they'll tell you the father's desire to be there is nothing compared to mom's wishes during labor. If his actions are causing stress, which is unhealthy during pregnancy and labor, and you don't want him there then the nurses will put him out and call security to keep him out. \n\nHe honestly has zero rights to attend the birth. This is a medical event for you, not a spectator sport. You're going to bleed, poop, be naked, possibly throw up, or could end up in surgery. You being supported and unstressed is what the nurses care about. He only gets to be there as long as you want him there and he's behaving himself.\n\nAlso go speak to your L&D nurses ahead of time and make sure you have your wishes set up with them. If you don't want people coming in for the delivery then tell them the names and they'll keep them away. If you want to restrict visitors to certain people and/or certain times just tell the nurses. Talk with them and ask them about how births typically go so you know what to expect and bring. \n\nEveryone brings baby stuff, but most forget mom is going to need comfortable clothes, help moving, nursing supplies or nursing clothes, and super heavy duty full coverage pads with comfy underwear because you're going to bleed like crazy for at least a week after giving birth. Ask about snacks and their food policy. The ACOG ruled against depriving laboring mothers of food ages ago, but some places still practice this and it can make it difficult to keep pushing if you run out of steam because you haven't eaten in awhile. It's best to know ahead of time so you can grab something before going in.\n\nAs a tip from when I had my kids. A simple loose dress you can just pull over your head and some slippers will be the easiest thing to put on after you give birth. It'll be very hard to bend over to pull on pants or shoes and it'll be painful too. The hospital will give you stretchy disposable underwear and giant pads but ask the L&D nurse what kind of pads they use and grab some ahead of time so you have them at home. Ask the nurses about after care supplies so you're set when you get home from the hospital. Meal prep too. You're going to be exhausted in every way imaginable when you get home. You'll hurt and be recovering physically for at least 6 weeks plus you'll be worn out from taking care of a newborn. Cook some meals ahead of time and freeze them so you can just toss them in the oven to reheat. If any of your friends or family ask what they can do or get you for the baby tell them meals or a little help around the house or with the baby so you can shower or nap without worrying. Good luck with your baby and I hope this helps.", "Info: have you had a conversation with MIL and SIL? Have they done something like this before where they broke your trust? I'm not saying you're wrong for holding back from them, I'm just wondering if you were able to properly voice your feelings before doing that.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your labor. You decide. I don't care about anything else.", "NTA \nYou are 100% entitled to your feelings which are 100% valid. However you've admitted his family has been nothing but good to you are you willing to let this 1 mistake ruin your family. Think about it discuss with your husband what you need to move pass this. Whether that be firmer boundaries a sincere apology from SIL and MIL. I want to reiterate you are not in the wrong but sometimes we hold on to things to the detriment of everything else.", "NTA. This wasn\u2019t their news to spread, no matter how excited they were. Your husband saying you\u2019re crossing lines with regards to who you have in the delivery room is a huge red flag. You don\u2019t feel comfortable or safe around MIL so you have every right to bar her, and anyone else you want, from a major medical procedure. Your feelings are paramount here and you have the right to bodily autonomy.", "I had a high risk pregnancy. I could control or have very very little that I wanted.  The one thing I wanted was a Halloween baby shower (she was due in December but came in November)  My mom endlessly complained she wanted all the cutsey stuff and I basically said then go have your own baby lol. I got my spooky shower. NTA", "I'll say NTA just ask them for time to cool off so you can think about it. You're hormones are racing right now and you just need time get away from the situation to process it. \n\nThis may be the hill you die on or you may end up feeling like a total ass in two weeks and either one is okay. \n\nWhen I was pregnant every little thing set me off, but I never had something this big happen so I get being pissed off. I got possed at Wendy's for a week because I ordered the caesar salad and when I got to the window to pay they said they messed up and actually didn't have it. That mad over a salad. \n\nSo either way you end up going it's not all entirely you're fault. You just have to ask yourself if the pros outweigh the cons and if it's worth it to you.", "No way you stand firm and set boundaries now or they will walk all over you. That was incredibly heartless for them to take that moment from you", "NTA.  I would forgive the SIL, mistakes do happen.  I would also forgive her not immediately telling you, since she probably trusted her mom not to blab.  No point upsetting you if it was just the one person. I can see why you wouldn\u2019t agree, that\u2019s just my opinion.  \n\nYour MIL made a choice though.  And ruined something that was important to you.  She broke your trust.  And she still thinks she\u2019s going to be allowed at a private medical procedure?! No. Absolutely not.  It\u2019s insane to me that a MIL or even mother would expect to be there! Labour is all about the person in labour and who she gets the most support from.\n\nMy moms my best friend, and she was there with my husband.  When the time came though, I only wanted my husband there. Trust me and the others agreeing, a delivery room is no place for spectators.  Giving birth is very vulnerable and private.  I didn\u2019t even want my own mother seeing me in pain. Let alone someone who just broke your trust!!\n\nI would still let your MIL be at the hospital waiting and be the first to hold the baby after you and your husband.. but instruct the nurses not to let her into the delivery room.  She can still be part of the day without being a spectator to your pain.", "I have read a lot of replies and I don't really agree with most here on one point. \n\nWe don't know it was the sister in laws choice. Just doing something does not make it a choice, or intentional. \n\n  \nIf they were having a conversation about the baby, and the sister said something like \"I can't wait to meet him\" instead of \"meet them\" then it wasn't a choice, it was a mistake.\n\n  \nNow MIL made a choice and is a huge asshole. But, depending on how it played out, I don't get punishing the sister for a slip of the tongue.  \nDoes she have a right to be angry? Of course. Should she feel and process her emotions? Of course. Should she distance herself for a bit? Sure.  Should she disinvite the sister from everything because of a mistake? In my opinion. No.  \n\n\nThe MIL though, she can kick rocks.", "NTA you need to have your husband sit down and read this post in the comments. He needs to realize that what happened was not an accident. There was no excuse whatsoever for what the sister did and what the mother did. Yeah the sister supposedly slipped up\u2026 But it was the mother that couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut. They showed you and your husband that they do not care about you or your child. They only care about themselves.\n\nAnd his mother is not entitled to see the birth of your child just because she is the grandparent.", "NTA. Your husband and his mother are major assholes.  Sorry OP", "NTA. No one has the right to be in the delivery room, including your husband. Talk with your delivery team to ensure your needs are taken care of.", "NTA\nalso no one is entitled to be at the birth wtf? Only my husband was present for ours. Having your gender reveal ruined for your first child i think warrants the response you\u2019re giving. But I\u2019m also pregnant so I\u2019m just mad for you", "NTA. Trust is a very fragile thing. Once lost it can be very difficult to get back. And it is dependent on the person and the trust broken. They hurt you, SIL by accident but MIL by choice.  I hope you can give them a chance to earn it back, truthfully you don\u2019t have much family left and it sounds like it used to be a good relationship.", "That was a really, really shitty thing for her to do. Never tell her anything again", "NTA. Stress delays labour, if you don\u2019t want them there you could prolong your labour for hours. They stole your moment with the gender reveal, that was their decision/fault. You\u2019re not obligated to have anyone in the room, nor any visitors. While it can be a lovely moment to share with the father of the baby, if he is going to be on his phone texting them the entire time or pushing you to let them in then perhaps he shouldn\u2019t be there. The nurses really don\u2019t have time to babysit him. They will be your sentries though- you can give them a code word to remove everyone from the room, you can make it so they don\u2019t release your name or let anyone back you just have to let them know when you are filling out the paperwork at pre-registration. \nIt might be a good idea to read some books on boundaries and also on grief, i expect that giving birth will bring up the emotions of the loss of your parents and you may need to plan on speaking to a professional about it because the ils are not going to be able to contain their joy of being the \u2018only\u2019 grandparents long enough to be comforting to you when you say that you wish they were here still. Even if you had a perfect relationship with them they would not really \u2018get it\u2019. Also be aware that while having a birth plan is great, it\u2019s something beyond your control and the best outcome is healthy mom and healthy baby. A lot of people now seem to be so determined for everything to go a precise way that any deviation makes them feel like a failure or makes them sad and the hormone crash after doesn\u2019t help that. Personally I hope that MIL comes up with a genuine apology that shows she actually understands how she betrayed you, but given that gender reveals used to only be possible after the birth of the child she never had one and so has nothing personal to relate it to unless you were to tell her to imagine the doctor taking the baby out the waiting room and telling everyone out there what it is before coming back to the room to tell her.", "NTA. The fact that your husband has decided to support his mother over his pregnant wife absolutely infuriates me. I'd be willing to bet he's done little to no research about pregnancy either or he wouldn't be acting like he's fucking 12.", "Love, this isn't about the gender reveal even if it feels like it's about the gender reveal. It might feel like things were taken out of your control and sometimes, you, I, and a lot of people, feel like if we can just control things things won't hurt so much. It sounds like you're in a lot of pain and no one is hearing it. Is there someone you can talk to about this? You're NTA but I get the feeling that if you don't tackle this that it may come out in ways that you don't expect. Love your way.", "NTA", "Wow your MIL and SIL suck and your husband is a jerk for not supporting you. I would be so upset if everyone knew my babies gender before and the party was ruined.", "Right? He thinks he has a right to see you give birth! \nNta", "Info - did they apologize?  I can understand being upset but eventually I hope you can forgive them if they are truly contrite.  You get to say who is in the labor room with you.  I hope you can get past this and enjoy your baby.", "NTA.", "NTA - Enjoy the peace and quiet. It's better gorgeous you and the baby.", "NTA. But everyone needs to cool down a bit - threatening to exclude your husband was really harsh, but so is him pressuring you into something you\u2019re not comfortable with. \n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like you got much of an apology from MIL or SIL, which you deserve. They\u2019re also your family and as upset as you are now (as a fellow pregnant lady in my third trimester and full of hormones, I feel you), you will want to work this out. Uninvited from appointments and shopping? Totally fair. Uninvited from the birth itself? Also fair. It\u2019s not fair to uninvited your husband, but he should be supporting you. And demanding an apology from him family. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your gender reveal party was spoiled, you\u2019re justified in feeling very pissed.", "NTA. But I would  send out a group chat message to the whole family letting them know about the situation so this won\u2019t be turned back on you by anyone spreading lies. Let the family know that there was supposed to be a gender reveal but that was cancelled because your MiL and sil went against your wishes and told the whole family behind your back without you even knowing yourself. Let them know you are deeply hurt and want no contact with them right now. I would honestly keep these two at arms length from now on no matter how much they apologize because clearly they care more about making themselves happy then about you.", "If this was the r/AmItheIncubator subreddit I feel like there is an ok chance that your husband and his mom think you are just a baby incubator.", "NTA and I don't care how close you get to people boundaries are boundaries and revealing the gender of SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD (just because they couldn't keep their trap shut) is definitely a breach of trust. You have the right to stop ANYONE from being in the labor room so your husband needs to get that and realize that YOU'RE having that baby, not him. He needs to get over his silly tantrum and support you and your feelings instead of causing you stress.", "NTA. This behavior won't stop after the baby is born", "You know you can be crystal clear and incredibly firm without ultimatums?\n\nLike saying \"I said No, don't bring it up again.\"\n\nUltimatums and threats poison relationships. Not a good idea.", "NTA.  Good for you for setting boundaries and enforcing them.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to navigate through this without the real support of family.  Your husband and your in-laws *should* fall under that \u201cfamily\u201d moniker, but they\u2019re treating you more like\u2026idk, exactly, but it\u2019s *cold*.  Like\u2026 an incubator?  A service provider?  \n\nI mean, how else can you reconcile telling everyone *but the mom* the baby\u2019s gender - making her the *last* to know - and then acting so bizarrely blas\u00e9 about it afterwards.  Just shrugging their shoulders like \u201cI just *can\u2019t* understand why the baby-making object is malfunctioning by displaying emotions?  I mean, doesn\u2019t it know its purpose is to provide this service and put on a birthing show for us, without complaint, and otherwise disappear into the background?\u201d\n\nJust yuck.\n\nYou and husband need marriage counseling, like *yesterday*.  He\u2019s NOT hearing you, NOT understanding the unsettling coldness and callousness of all this, and that\u2019s NOT ok.  *That has to end*.  \n\nIf he\u2019s unwilling to see a marriage counselor with you, and unwilling to make some pretty significant shifts in mindset and priorities, then you should start contacting friends, extended family (if there\u2019s anyone), co-workers, etc.  Investigate options for a place to stay for awhile, just in case.  Give yourself that option, that potential \u201cout,\u201d so you\u2019re not approaching all these tough future conversations and interactions from a place of \u201cwhat can I do, I don\u2019t have anywhere else to go.\u201d", "No MIL should not attend the birth of a child.

That is a wound that will always sting I\u2019m afraid. And it\u2019s one that will also never go away. And will creep up at any time. \n\nI would tell you this if you were my friend - your pregnancy should be beautiful *and happy*. It\u2019s bittersweet I\u2019m sure but you are carrying life. A beautiful baby boy, congrats! Consider him a gift from your folks up above they picked him just for you. \n\nYou should do everything you can to honor your parents.

You are doing what you need to do to protect yourself and your soon to be baby. What an incredibly unfair and cruel thing of your MIL to \u201clet slip\u201d that was not her news to share. That your husband isn\u2019t absolutely livid with them is the part that concerns me the most. If you\u2019re not already, I would very much encourage you and your husband to do some couples counseling - bc once the baby comes - this shit with your in-laws will only pick up and be more invasive. \n\nEveryone wants to champion the baby - the baby doesn\u2019t need that - the baby has you.

I hate gender reveal party but if someone want it let them have it, their life their choice.", "NTA\n\nSet boundaries now, so when your son is born they can not say you didn\u2019t tell them.

(1) forgiveness in a family, and (2) your comfort while labouring.\n\nBe careful not to mush them together because they\u2019re not at all the same.  Labour is a dangerous time for mom and baby and any stress increases that danger.  Your labouring is different to meeting the newborn baby.  Dad can be brought in after labour to cut the cord.  I was in labour for 36 hours. It\u2019s not really about the baby.\n\nFamily forgiveness is a separate issue.  It\u2019s not about whether you have a genuine and legitimate reason for being upset - because you absolutely do - it\u2019s about what kind of family you want.  When you love people you forgive them.  How many times were you rude to your mom as a teenager and she forgave you?  How many times did your mom say or do something annoying and you forgave her because you loved her?\n\nYou forgive your husbands family because you love your husband.\n\nNTA", "I think your MIL, SIL and husband should be more focused on how they can build back trust in your relationships with them then worrying about the privileges they just lost due to their own behavior, accident or no. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

I guess I would flat out tell MIL and SIL that they clearly demonstrated they could not be trusted to give a simple party. Why would you trust them to support you during the birth of your child?

At this point, she already knows they literally \"can't help themselves\" and why would you ever give them information to spread again? \n\n\nPut that bit in quotes because as said above, no matter how tempted you are to share someone's news, if you share someone elses secret that is a choice. If you can't keep a secret, you tell that person that you can't keep a secret before you know it. You don't take the risk and then make the choice to tell someone who you KNOW won't be able to keep it a secret as well. She knows her mom, and lnew that she herself was tempted to tell. I'm imagining a decision with little to no thought involved, where she thought \"hopefully she won't tell, but if she does then at least it wasn't me. They can't be mad at mom, she's just always been this way.\" Then after the fact, mom pulls her excuse out of her bag: \"I'm sorry, I was just SO excited!\" Already pulling the excited (and entitled) grandma card before he's even born, and stealing momentous events from the mom of the baby to boot! \n\nI would certainly nip this in the bud before it gets out of hand.
