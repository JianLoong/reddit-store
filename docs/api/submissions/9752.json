I should have handled the situation differently(I NEVER said no to her).\n\nWhen Mark went on leave for the first time he was home for 2 weeks before he got shipped out. In those two weeks Alice was conceived. Mark is 100% Alice's bio dad.\n\nDisregarding Alice's feelings was the last thing I wanted to do. May, Alice and Jenny are my world. I don't treat my daughters any different.\n\nMy feelings for May changed when I saw the way she would interact with Alice after they moved in. It filled my heart with more emotion and love that I had not felt ever before that point.\n\nThe party was just close family which is only us 4 and Mark's/my parents. Since it was a week night. They left so we could work things out.\n\nMark is the only reason I made it past my teen years. I was in a deep and dark spiral. He saved me. So when people say he is dead get over it. I CAN'T. He never gave up on me and I refuse to give him up.\n\nI went to Mark's parents and had a nice talk with them. They said Mark would be happy and proud of who I am and how well I have taken care of the people he loved. They don't feel like I am replacing their son in any way but I am a son to them.\n\nI called my wife she agreed to talk. I admitted how I felt we should've had this talk before the party and this could've been avoided. At that she did apologize. I then explained more about why I said what I did(personal feelings and emotions) She said that she thought I would be happy and sign. I explained my point of view she understood my concerns and hesitation.\u00a0We were finishing the conversation when Jenny ran out if her room and asked if we were okay. I said yes and that I love her very much.\n\nI then went to talk to Alice alone. I went to her room and my heart broke again. She was still crying on her bed. I knocked and asked if we could talk. She squeaked out a yes. I sat on the edge of her bed while she had her back to me.\u00a0I told her that I love her and I will always be her dad. I apologized saying that I never meant to hurt her, sometimes adults make mistakes and are not clear with their words or emotions. I made a mistake and hope one day I can make it up to her. I explained Mark was a very important person in my life and I am grateful that he was able to help bring a beautiful and special daughter in to my life. I will always love her and that I have the best daughters in the world.(Not the full conversation)\n\nShe turned around hugged me really tight. It was one of the best hugs of my life. I told her that it would be my honor to adopt her if she still wants that. Between sobs she said she did. We stayed like that until she fell asleep.\n\nAfter that May and I did a very overdue heart to heart and deep talk. It is not all sunshine and rainbows we still have a lot of healing to do.\n\nI have not signed yet(I will). We as a family are looking through all of the legal options and we are on the books for therapy.", "created_utc": 1676189213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110aj01/aita_update_not_wanting_to_officially_adopt_my/", "score": 1016, "replies": ["YESS SIRRRR THE GOOD ENDING I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU", "Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y80s2/aita_for_not_wanting_officially_adopting_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Congratulations", "Just when I was over these subreddits and the internet in general, along comes posts like yours, and not only do I end up changing my mind, I find true value in many posts and comments.\n\nDamn it! I'm gonna have to stay on Reddit thanks to those who are like you. \ud83d\ude42\u262e\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "OP I am just going to say that I am glad you are healing with your family and this had a happy ending, but when you adopt her, you and your wife can talk about hyphenating her last name. I know that is not the main point of this, but this way she can always keep a part of her bio dad and have you too. Or can add it as a middle name. Just wanted to put those options out there.", "If you do adopt her will she still be able to get Mark's benefits as he passed away while on active duty?", "thats beautiful thank you for this update", "I think you made the right choice. \n\nAlice is here, she wants you to be her dad (officially :) ) so I\u2019m glad you chose to make her wish come true. I have a feeling Mark would be proud of you.", "This was so touching to read. I was confused by how many were labeling you the asshole. It's such a complicated situation and I'm glad you were able to work through it with communication. Wish you all the best", "Grief clouds judgment. You're a good sort and it's good to know the fog has lifted.", "I'm not crying, you're crying!\n\nSeriously though, loved reading that. Glad everything worked out :)", "You made my day, OP. Tears of joy here!", "Ooooo that's a good point to consider! \n\nOp it's worth looking into and then can always explain you will adopt afterwards", "Also be absolutely certain that they won't already consider this a de facto adoption (common law or somesuch) and she isn't already out of anything because her mother married OP and he's *very* patently taken the role of father.", "The [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y80s2/aita_for_not_wanting_officially_adopting_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nLove to see all the communication in this one, hopefully things work out. It just needed some real talking way before the papers were adopted. mark seems like he was a wonderful person \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure you are but someone mentioned Alice\u2019s military benefits, you guys should check how they are impacted by the adoption to make sure you\u2019re all clear on that side. Good luck! \ud83e\udd70", "I read your other post after seeing this one and personally I would've voted NAH while acknowledging it was deeply hurtful for unintentional reasons, but definitely NAH today.\n\nIn Judaism we have a law. When a man dies with no children his brother is obligated to offer his brother's widow the chance to have a child in her brother's name. If they don't wish to do this the widow condemns him for abandoning his brother's name, spits at him, and takes off his shoe.\n\nObviously in modern times it's a formality, but the *meaning* still stands. \n\nYou aren't dishonoring or replacing him by adopting her, just the opposite.\n\nYou took your \"brother\"'s family into your home as if they were your own, grew to love them honestly as your own, and have done right by them to such a degree that his daughter has *chosen* you despite knowing about her biological father her entire life.\n\nBecause of you she grew up in a loving and stable home. Because of you she will always know what a healthy family looks like. Because of you she even knows that sometimes you can hurt someone by accident, not because you don't love them but precisely because do you love them so much and thought you were doing the right thing. And most importantly because of you she learned how to make it right when you have a fight and hurt the people you love.\n\nWe have a saying: Whoever saves one life, it is as if he had saved the entire world.\n\nYou saved one little girl. You loved her so much she chose you as the only father she's ever truly known. And because of you, your friend will live on for generations.", "This is a great update, thanks for letting us know. I didn't see the original post but I strongly disagree with the verdict. Those papers should never have been sprung on you as a surprise, no matter how much you feel like Alice's dad you were always likely to at least feel sad about any change in Mark's status as her father and May should have warned you (and Mark's parents too). \n\nI'm glad you and May have plans to talk more, it feels like you're in very different places regarding Mark and remembering and grieving him. That's totally understandable, you are different people who had different relationships with him, but it's notable that May didn't anticipate your reaction. Either she doesn't understand how you feel/felt about Mark and his being Alice's father because you haven't communicated it or you have communicated it and she didn't hear or understand. Either way you do need to understand how each other feels better", "You're a good father and a caring friend. Congrats OP.", "Omg not me crying my eyes out over here\u2026", "If you\u2019re the US, would you lose social security for the girl?", "NTA, i don\u2019t know why people were mad at you in the first post. It makes sense that you\u2019d have to think about it. You got blindsided with adoption papers at her party.", "What a special sorry.. you guys were all meant to be part of each others lives it\u2019s really wonderful.\nThis made me sob a little \ud83e\udd72", "I\u2019m really happy about how everything turned out and strongly disagree with the verdict on the main post, it\u2019s never a good idea to surprise someone with something huge, mainly because this affected Alice, a child. \n\nI love that divorcing was never an option because this really just needed some talking!", "Jumping on to emphasize the exploring military benefits. Please delve into this.  Having 100% of college paid AND receiving a stipend is a good reason to have an informal ceremony now with family to adopt her and wait for the legal adoption.\n\nYou all obviously love each other very much and maybe you can change her name to yours so she gets to be just like everyone else in the family but still can keep her first dad's benefits.", "Isn't this only for the wife? What benefits would there be for the child", "There might be another side of it, though, that if OP and his wife get divorce he won't have an easy time getting even partial custody of her, or if wife dies it might be harder for him to be deemed the legal guardian.", "I think the only asshole in the situation was May for springing it on OP as a surprise that was done in front of Alice. She really should have spoken with him about it privately first without the kids or other extended family there.", "Beautifully written! I'm not crying at all... \u2764\n\nWe had a similar custom in my culture (Balkan area) but not in a form of a law. My maternal great-grandmother was the widow of my great-grandfather's brother before they married. It was considered to be the great-grandpa's duty, as an unmarried brother, to take care of her. She had two children by her first husband when great-grandpa married her. Sadly, they died, too. They went on to have three children of their own, my grandma being one of them.", "Why would she change her last name at all?", "Children get survivors benefits and college money", "That's pretty common with adoption.  If the girl wanted to be adopted, there's a pretty good chance she wants the name change too.", "Idk about military but she would keep getting the social security survivor benefits.", "Oh I didn't know that. That does kinda put in a reason to wait.", "If Alice is an American citizen, she should be getting social security child survivorship benefits under Mark's account. If OP adopts her, those benefits cease.\n\nMay want to wait until Alice turns 18 before adopting her. That's when the survivorship benefits would end anyway. Otherwise, she may be giving up five figures of benefits, money that she can use for things like college.", "Original post? Never mind. Found it.", "If more Dads were like you 60% of all posts in this sub would disappear.", "Wow,this is a lovely ending.", "I'm so glad things are working out for you all. It's clear your daughters are your everything, and you're theirs, and its great to see you coming together and making it official.  I'm also sorry that, with the best of intentions, they essentially dropped you into a TikTok moment. Delicate, important decisions like this should be given the space and attention they deserve. But it was done in love, and I'm glad you've all landed safely.\n\nAnd last but not least, your deep love for Mark and your sense of loss is palpable. There's an expression, \"May his memory be a blessing.\" That's how you're living... keeping his memory alive as a blessing to the world. You continue to honor him, and I know he's looking down on you--and all of you--with love and pride.\n\nGood luck to you all!", "op, thank you so much for this update. I am so glad this worked and you were all able to communicate.  Good luck to you and your sweet family as you continue.", "Hopefully someone options this story for a Hallmark movie.

Surviving children who are adopted by a non-military member after the death of the sponsor remain eligible for all benefits as shown in this section.", "I understand that this is a important thing to look into, but I\u2019d be willing to bet a lot that she would still get them. I can\u2019t imagine the military would be set up in a way that would prevent the children of dead soldiers from being adopted.", "She should still get survivors benefits from the VA as long as she doesn\u2019t marry before she\u2019s 18 (or 23 if going to school).  \n\nI don\u2019t know if college is still covered, I believe it will be, but that is something to absolutely look into before signing the papers.", "I was very surprised by the Y T A verdict too.

If he had said yes, he would probably put those feelings in a back drawer and be resentful for the rest of his life (or until he \u201cexploded\u201d). Good thing that he talked and got to express everything that bothered him!", "Yes, she's probably the only one who doesn't share the last name with the rest of her family, I can see she wanting to change that.", "The top comment on the original post is honestly really annoying. Like of course OP is going to want to honour the memory of someone who was essentially his big brother, and be respectful to the feelings of his parental figures. Having a good relationship with his daughter doesn't just erase his grief for his brother. \n\nAnd even if OP had been 100% enthusiastic about the adoption situation, springing the request on the bio dad's parents is incredibly thoughtless and disrespectful. By all accounts they have been extremely understanding but I'm sure their son's kid being adopted has got to bring up all sorts of grief for them. I'm sure they would have preferred to privately react to the news in their own time."]}
