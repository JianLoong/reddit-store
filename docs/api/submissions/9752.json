I should have handled the situation differently(I NEVER said no to her).\n\nWhen Mark went on leave for the first time he was home for 2 weeks before he got shipped out. In those two weeks Alice was conceived. Mark is 100% Alice's bio dad.\n\nDisregarding Alice's feelings was the last thing I wanted to do. May, Alice and Jenny are my world. I don't treat my daughters any different.\n\nMy feelings for May changed when I saw the way she would interact with Alice after they moved in. It filled my heart with more emotion and love that I had not felt ever before that point.\n\nThe party was just close family which is only us 4 and Mark's/my parents. Since it was a week night. They left so we could work things out.\n\nMark is the only reason I made it past my teen years. I was in a deep and dark spiral. He saved me. So when people say he is dead get over it. I CAN'T. He never gave up on me and I refuse to give him up.\n\nI went to Mark's parents and had a nice talk with them. They said Mark would be happy and proud of who I am and how well I have taken care of the people he loved. They don't feel like I am replacing their son in any way but I am a son to them.\n\nI called my wife she agreed to talk. I admitted how I felt we should've had this talk before the party and this could've been avoided. At that she did apologize. I then explained more about why I said what I did(personal feelings and emotions) She said that she thought I would be happy and sign. I explained my point of view she understood my concerns and hesitation.\u00a0We were finishing the conversation when Jenny ran out if her room and asked if we were okay. I said yes and that I love her very much.\n\nI then went to talk to Alice alone. I went to her room and my heart broke again. She was still crying on her bed. I knocked and asked if we could talk. She squeaked out a yes. I sat on the edge of her bed while she had her back to me.\u00a0I told her that I love her and I will always be her dad. I apologized saying that I never meant to hurt her, sometimes adults make mistakes and are not clear with their words or emotions. I made a mistake and hope one day I can make it up to her. I explained Mark was a very important person in my life and I am grateful that he was able to help bring a beautiful and special daughter in to my life. I will always love her and that I have the best daughters in the world.(Not the full conversation)\n\nShe turned around hugged me really tight. It was one of the best hugs of my life. I told her that it would be my honor to adopt her if she still wants that. Between sobs she said she did. We stayed like that until she fell asleep.\n\nAfter that May and I did a very overdue heart to heart and deep talk. It is not all sunshine and rainbows we still have a lot of healing to do.\n\nI have not signed yet(I will). We as a family are looking through all of the legal options and we are on the books for therapy.", "created_utc": 1676189213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110aj01/aita_update_not_wanting_to_officially_adopt_my/", "score": 1980, "replies": ["YESS SIRRRR THE GOOD ENDING I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU", "Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y80s2/aita_for_not_wanting_officially_adopting_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Congratulations", "Just when I was over these subreddits and the internet in general, along comes posts like yours, and not only do I end up changing my mind, I find true value in many posts and comments.\n\nDamn it!

It just needed some real talking way before the papers were adopted. mark seems like he was a wonderful person \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure you are but someone mentioned Alice\u2019s military benefits, you guys should check how they are impacted by the adoption to make sure you\u2019re all clear on that side. Good luck! \ud83e\udd70", "I read your other post after seeing this one and personally I would've voted NAH while acknowledging it was deeply hurtful for unintentional reasons, but definitely NAH today.\n\nIn Judaism we have a law. When a man dies with no children his brother is obligated to offer his brother's widow the chance to have a child in her brother's name. If they don't wish to do this the widow condemns him for abandoning his brother's name, spits at him, and takes off his shoe.\n\nObviously in modern times it's a formality, but the *meaning* still stands. \n\nYou aren't dishonoring or replacing him by adopting her, just the opposite.\n\nYou took your \"brother\"'s family into your home as if they were your own, grew to love them honestly as your own, and have done right by them to such a degree that his daughter has *chosen* you despite knowing about her biological father her entire life.\n\nBecause of you she grew up in a loving and stable home. Because of you she will always know what a healthy family looks like. Because of you she even knows that sometimes you can hurt someone by accident, not because you don't love them but precisely because do you love them so much and thought you were doing the right thing. And most importantly because of you she learned how to make it right when you have a fight and hurt the people you love.\n\nWe have a saying: Whoever saves one life, it is as if he had saved the entire world.\n\nYou saved one little girl. You loved her so much she chose you as the only father she's ever truly known. And because of you, your friend will live on for generations.", "This is a great update, thanks for letting us know. I didn't see the original post but I strongly disagree with the verdict. Those papers should never have been sprung on you as a surprise, no matter how much you feel like Alice's dad you were always likely to at least feel sad about any change in Mark's status as her father and May should have warned you (and Mark's parents too). \n\nI'm glad you and May have plans to talk more, it feels like you're in very different places regarding Mark and remembering and grieving him. That's totally understandable, you are different people who had different relationships with him, but it's notable that May didn't anticipate your reaction. Either she doesn't understand how you feel/felt about Mark and his being Alice's father because you haven't communicated it or you have communicated it and she didn't hear or understand. Either way you do need to understand how each other feels better", "You're a good father and a caring friend.

Please delve into this.  Having 100% of college paid AND receiving a stipend is a good reason to have an informal ceremony now with family to adopt her and wait for the legal adoption.\n\nYou all obviously love each other very much and maybe you can change her name to yours so she gets to be just like everyone else in the family but still can keep her first dad's benefits.", "Isn't this only for the wife? What benefits would there be for the child", "There might be another side of it, though, that if OP and his wife get divorce he won't have an easy time getting even partial custody of her, or if wife dies it might be harder for him to be deemed the legal guardian.", "I think the only asshole in the situation was May for springing it on OP as a surprise that was done in front of Alice. She really should have spoken with him about it privately first without the kids or other extended family there.", "Beautifully written! I'm not crying at all... \u2764\n\nWe had a similar custom in my culture (Balkan area) but not in a form of a law.

That does kinda put in a reason to wait.", "If Alice is an American citizen, she should be getting social security child survivorship benefits under Mark's account.

But it was done in love, and I'm glad you've all landed safely.\n\nAnd last but not least, your deep love for Mark and your sense of loss is palpable. There's an expression, \"May his memory be a blessing.\" That's how you're living... keeping his memory alive as a blessing to the world.

Having a good relationship with his daughter doesn't just erase his grief for his brother. \n\nAnd even if OP had been 100% enthusiastic about the adoption situation, springing the request on the bio dad's parents is incredibly thoughtless and disrespectful. By all accounts they have been extremely understanding but I'm sure their son's kid being adopted has got to bring up all sorts of grief for them.
