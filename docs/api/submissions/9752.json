I should have handled the situation differently(I NEVER said no to her).\n\nWhen Mark went on leave for the first time he was home for 2 weeks before he got shipped out. In those two weeks Alice was conceived. Mark is 100% Alice's bio dad.\n\nDisregarding Alice's feelings was the last thing I wanted to do. May, Alice and Jenny are my world. I don't treat my daughters any different.\n\nMy feelings for May changed when I saw the way she would interact with Alice after they moved in. It filled my heart with more emotion and love that I had not felt ever before that point.\n\nThe party was just close family which is only us 4 and Mark's/my parents. Since it was a week night. They left so we could work things out.\n\nMark is the only reason I made it past my teen years. I was in a deep and dark spiral. He saved me. So when people say he is dead get over it. I CAN'T. He never gave up on me and I refuse to give him up.\n\nI went to Mark's parents and had a nice talk with them. They said Mark would be happy and proud of who I am and how well I have taken care of the people he loved. They don't feel like I am replacing their son in any way but I am a son to them.\n\nI called my wife she agreed to talk. I admitted how I felt we should've had this talk before the party and this could've been avoided. At that she did apologize. I then explained more about why I said what I did(personal feelings and emotions) She said that she thought I would be happy and sign. I explained my point of view she understood my concerns and hesitation.\u00a0We were finishing the conversation when Jenny ran out if her room and asked if we were okay. I said yes and that I love her very much.\n\nI then went to talk to Alice alone. I went to her room and my heart broke again. She was still crying on her bed. I knocked and asked if we could talk. She squeaked out a yes. I sat on the edge of her bed while she had her back to me.\u00a0I told her that I love her and I will always be her dad. I apologized saying that I never meant to hurt her, sometimes adults make mistakes and are not clear with their words or emotions. I made a mistake and hope one day I can make it up to her. I explained Mark was a very important person in my life and I am grateful that he was able to help bring a beautiful and special daughter in to my life. I will always love her and that I have the best daughters in the world.(Not the full conversation)\n\nShe turned around hugged me really tight. It was one of the best hugs of my life. I told her that it would be my honor to adopt her if she still wants that. Between sobs she said she did. We stayed like that until she fell asleep.\n\nAfter that May and I did a very overdue heart to heart and deep talk. It is not all sunshine and rainbows we still have a lot of healing to do.\n\nI have not signed yet(I will). We as a family are looking through all of the legal options and we are on the books for therapy.", "created_utc": 1676189213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110aj01/aita_update_not_wanting_to_officially_adopt_my/", "score": 161, "replies": ["YESS SIRRRR THE GOOD ENDING I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU", "Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y80s2/aita_for_not_wanting_officially_adopting_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Congratulations", "Just when I was over these subreddits and the internet in general, along comes posts like yours, and not only do I end up changing my mind, I find true value in many posts and comments.\n\nDamn it! I'm gonna have to stay on Reddit thanks to those who are like you. \ud83d\ude42\u262e\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "OP I am just going to say that I am glad you are healing with your family and this had a happy ending, but when you adopt her, you and your wife can talk about hyphenating her last name. I know that is not the main point of this, but this way she can always keep a part of her bio dad and have you too. Or can add it as a middle name. Just wanted to put those options out there.", "If you do adopt her will she still be able to get Mark's benefits as he passed away while on active duty?", "thats beautiful thank you for this update", "I think you made the right choice. \n\nAlice is here, she wants you to be her dad (officially :) ) so I\u2019m glad you chose to make her wish come true. I have a feeling Mark would be proud of you.", "This was so touching to read. I was confused by how many were labeling you the asshole. It's such a complicated situation and I'm glad you were able to work through it with communication. Wish you all the best", "Grief clouds judgment. You're a good sort and it's good to know the fog has lifted.", "I'm not crying, you're crying!\n\nSeriously though, loved reading that. Glad everything worked out :)", "You made my day, OP. Tears of joy here!", "Ooooo that's a good point to consider! \n\nOp it's worth looking into and then can always explain you will adopt afterwards", "Also be absolutely certain that they won't already consider this a de facto adoption (common law or somesuch) and she isn't already out of anything because her mother married OP and he's *very* patently taken the role of father."]}
