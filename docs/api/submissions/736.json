When I called the number that wasn't my Moms a girl answered and I was a little suspicious so I asked my bf to look through his phone which I would never normally do. \n\nWhen I looked through his phone I saw a message to a random girl that I didn't know he was friends with asking her if she was ok after a minor car accident. I didn't really care about what he said I just didn't like that he was messaging a random girl on snapchat, he also had a streak with her at one point during our relationship that I never knew about. I got upset initially but by the end of the night it was fine. I didn't finish looking at the messages but I noticed there were messages to another girl. \n\nThe next day I asked him if I could look at the other snaps, he agreed and I found what I felt was an innapropriate conversation with a girl he had talked to romantically before we were dating and who had asked him on multiple dates. He replied to her post where she said shes going to become a stripper and send innapropriate pictures to guys because guys are pigs and horny. He flirtatiously said he thought the post was funny and they went back and forth for a while. He openly told me that he was hiding this from me and that he regretted it after he sent it. \n\nI feel that its not a lot to ask to not add and talk to random girls and go out of his way to flirt with people that clearly have feelings for him but he insists that she was just a friend on his track team and that it wasn't wrong.

He said much of the same thing you did, but also didn't mention he had a previous chat streak with the girl that had a car accident. And, he also didn't mention that the girl he flirted with had asked him out a few times. My understanding from his post was that he and both girls almost never communicated before and he didn't really know either one very well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am 40 and have never done it. If I think I have to do that, I wouldn't be with the person or I would go get help for my insecurity", "NTA your concerns are legitimate. Asking him not to flirt with other women is very reasonable.", "NTA - You communicated how you were feeling  in a respectful way. You didn't violate any of his boundaries by snooping in his phone. You asked if you could look at his messages and he showed you willingly. In a relationship where both parties are still young and you are both coming into young adulthood, I think learning how to communicate expectations and insecurities in a relationship is super important.", "He let her take the phone willingly though without complaint. He clearly didn\u2019t care", "I agree"]}
