It might not be much, but might help her buy books for university. \n\nIf you do go this route, I highly suggest not telling your sister or niece about it until she graduates high school so that they don't try to access the money early or create unreasonable expectations for funds.", "NTA. Your wife was absolutely correct in what she said. Ana is grown woman who made poor decisions. She doesn't need to be cuddle.

Your sister has some kinda nerve to ask you to put your kid in public school just because she wants her kid in a fancy private school and blew her money.

If the situation was turned around, she would have laughed in your face and called you several nasty names. \n\nNot all private schools are better than public ones. Her daughter can attend a public school and get her act together and get good grades and maybe apply for a scholarship.

Can you help out with a good extracurricular that will help her get into college? Does she need a tutor? Or send her to a college prep camp this summer? You don't have to go above & beyond, but you can help so she doesn't end up in a poverty loop. $5000 is nothing to two tech workers who are good at finances, whereas it'll go so far to helping your niece.

I\u2019m talking about art classes in museums, space and tech camps, music camps at Ivy League schools etc. but also writing, pre-college and test prep programs. All free. I would research from August- November and set up excel sheets and application due date reminders. My daughter and I would review all of the opportunities and then we would focus on applying for the ones that she loved and apply early. I did the same for my niece. It helped her learn to navigate the application process, essay writing, portfolio requirements - lots of real world experience.

I'm also an aunt putting back money to help my niece & nephew when they're older. I'd never give their parents money. I do take them to the eye doctor & dentist. I won't be getting anything extra, but I make sure the basics are covered.\n\nMaybe it's time to have a one on one conversation with Mallory about what you help with, and what if anything you can & can't help with in the future as she goes through high school and college. She's old enough. I cannot stress how much it sucks to be the poor kid with rich cousins. I do not mean in a superficial I didn't have cool clothes way, I mean little things that would have helped me with long term success. \n\nYou can say something like, \"We won't be paying for private school or your college tuition, but we will help you with SAT or AP class fees and help you pay college application fees. We'll help you find paid internships in college. If you maintan an XYZ GPA in high school, you'll get X gift when you graduate. If you maintain xyz GPA in college, you'll get X gift when you graduate.\" Of course doesnt necessarily have to be GPA related or college, whatever post-high school education is best. I'm not even saying anything extravagant, it will just give her a combination of motivation & security & she'll know if she does her part you're not going to let her just flounder.\n\nIt's really, really important she understands that although you're not paying for all the things, that you're going to do your best to help her have the tools to succeed.", "Ana is obviously too busy wallowing so n self pity and envy to step up and help her daughter", "This is amazing!

Kudos to you for pulling through so much for your child - hoping we can help Ana do the same.", "Ya I think this is where my parents initially failed Ana. Looking back now, neither of us should have been handed $80,000 upon graduating high school.

My own parents basically kicked her to the curb which I wish they didn\u2019t, but at the same time I can\u2019t force them to be obligated to someone else\u2019s child because then I\u2019d be the hypocrite. Bio dad basically argued sexual assault because he had evidence that he agreed with her that they would not be in a relationship or have any kids by using contraceptives, and had evidence she purposefully ruined some of the contraceptives in order to get pregnant without his knowledge. And he was a lawyer so I\u2019m guessing definitely some connections to judges and all that.", "I\u2019ll definitely talk to Ana about online school, it may be the perfect compromise in helping my niece.

My heart really goes out to her. Your first obligation is to your wife and children. I\u2019m angry at your sister for being so irresponsible. \n\nAs for things you might be able to do. I have some thoughts for you and your wife to discuss:\n1.  If you\u2019re able, would both/either of you be able to meet with her one or two hours a week to help with tutoring? Building her academic confidence is a huge gift. \n2.  Can you have her come over to help with chores and pay her?  You could encourage her to open a bank account. Plus, it gives her an opportunity to spend time with both/either of you. \n3.  Looking ahead to summer, is it possible to send her to a summer camp?  I realize this is a financial investment, but many camps provide financial assistance. \n4.  Are there any community or religious organizations she could participate in?  This could help with getting her around a positive environment and make new friendships. \n5.  Has she expressed any interest in what she\u2019d like to be when she grows up?  If so, try to explore those areas with her. \n6.  What about hobbies?  My son was crazy about learning how to bake at that age. He is now a fearless baker (tonight he made a Black Forest cake to enjoy with his friends).\n7.  Sports?  Where I live, there are some second hand sports equipment shops where I\u2019d take my son. He tried out a few sports until he found what he liked, which was swimming. \n8.  Is it possible to have her to your house for an overnight stay?  It could help her know she has a family who loves her. What you build now could be a lifeline later. \n9.  This is an old-fashioned idea, but write her a letter every month. Encourage, empathize, support, and notice how she is growing/developing. I\u2019m 60, and I still have the few letters my Dad wrote to me. They are cherished memories of him. \n10. Talk with your parents about Mal. I understand going NC with your sister. But are they willing to support Mal?  An anonymous YMCA/Boys Girls Club membership could be a possibility. But this is delicate and you will need to respect their choice. \n\nI hope something here can work for you and your wife.  Just remember that you need to approach this together. Best regards to you!", "Seems like handing over money at 18 with no strings is what caused this mess though\u2026", "I'm willing to bet that paying for the private school would just create a slippery slope for Ana to ask for more things. If Mallory is really feeling bad about being poor and not having nice things, and comparing herself to wealthier relatives, sending her to a private school where most/all of the students will be fairly well-off is going to make her feel MUCH worse. Then Ana will probably ask OP to pay for things like expensive new clothes and gadgets so she can fit in.\n\nAnd if poverty and comparison are the causes of her behavior, then switching to the private school would again probably just make her worse. Though I do question Ana's claim that she's acting out.\n\nAll of this said, if I were OP I'd try to figure out some way to help Mallory, if he can swing it. Nice thing to do and all of that. Maybe pay for an extracurricular activity or some other hobby/activity she's interested in.", "She lives about 30min away from us, so we will definitely look into this to see if we can get around transportation as well", "Geez, poor Mal.

I don\u2019t know man. I wouldn\u2019t want a person like that my house. If you feel that way then maybe you should take her in", "OP said they couldn't afford to pay for private school. Understandable, because that's a huge expense. But they might be able to pay for other, less expensive things, or help in non-monetary ways.", "They both passed I believe. Mal\u2019s bio dad was much older when she was born so her grandparents on that side were likely in their 70s/80s at the time. Don\u2019t know too much about the rest of his family"]}
