I get along very well with his partner and accepted to be their bridesmaid when asked. However, when it came to talk about dresses I was worried as I\u2019m a much bigger girl than her and all of the other bridesmaids. For context, I\u2019m about a size 20/22 whereas the others are a size 12 or smaller. I am okay with my body although I am trying to lose some weight. However, due to my size I always try to dress in ways that flatter my shape and stay clear of anything that\u2019s tight. When I was asked to be a bridesmaid I mentioned that I\u2019d really want a dress that isn\u2019t super tight so I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable all day and not be happy at my brothers special day. Well she ordered a dress that all the other bridesmaids tried on and liked however, the biggest size that it came in was a 18. I offered to try it on to try and be accommodating however even though I could get it on it was super unflattering and was way too tight in the bust area. She then found a similar dress that came in bigger size however it was a slightly different colour. I tried it on but mentioned that being up there with all the other bridesmaids in slightly different dress might not look the best. I said I would prefer if she looks at other dresses and maybe some that were a bit more loose and came in all sizes so I could have the same as every one. However, the other bridesmaids all want something more fitting to their bodies. I also said that if she liked the dress that all the other bridesmaids liked then I\u2019m happy for her to choose that one and I would step back at being a bridesmaid. That way I can choose a lovely guest dress and just me being at there big day is enough for me. She said she really wants me to be a bridesmaid but is struggling to find a dress for everyone and is upset that I offered to not be a bridesmaid. AITA for not just accepting the dress that the others liked and should I just suck up having to wear a dress that shows all my rolls off", "created_utc": 1687038877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c2xbi/aita_for_not_wanting_to_wear_the_bridesmaid_dress/", "score": 436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn't hard and I find it really rude that they chose a dress that doesn't even come in a 20. NTA.", "NTA. It is NOT that hard to find bridesmaid dresses that come in plus sizes, especially a size 20-22. She was inconsiderate not to even consider dresses that wouldn\u2019t fit you.", "NAH. If I understand correctly, the dress she wants doesn't even fit you. Either way, having to wear something that makes you physically uncomfortable is different from not wanting to wear a dress because you think it's ugly or tacky (as most bridesmaid dresses are). It was generous of you to offer stepping down, though I can understand her frustration in wanting you to be involved, too. I hope you can jointly find a solution.", "NAH, but a couple of suggestions:\n- See whether a tailor can add a panel to the bust of the original dress. You\u2019d be surprised at what can be done. There\u2019s probably also a little bit of the dress fabric available on the interior, but if you need it hemmed, then that fabric could possibly also be used. \n- Step back as a bridesmaid but offer to do a reading or something of that nature. You could wear a coordinating dress and still be part of the wedding, but no one would think twice about your being in a different dress.

Just as it's unreasonable for her to expect you to magically fit in a dress two sizes smaller than what you normally wear.\n\nMy honest take is that she expects you to wear the too small, massively unflattering dress that her friends like.", "Normally, I\u2019m the first person to say \u201cYou agreed to be a bridesmaid.

I\u2019m in a 20 dress in a few weeks, the other bridesmaids are a 12,8 &6!  We all have the same colour dress but slightly different styles to flatter us all!

Can you find out the designer / color and order something from the same bridal shop that's in the same color (or a very similar color) but in a style that is flattering to your figure and in the correct size? Your dress doesn't need to be the exact same style as everyone else's. No one is going to be taking notes on all the bridesmaids. They will be looking at the bride. You will be up there looking and feeling confident in your awesome dress. It will be great!\n\nI'm not sure that asking the rest of the bridesmaids to change dresses so that you can all match is the answer. If everyone in the wedding party is a very different size, it's unlikely there is any one dress out there that is going to flatter everyone's figure anyway. If they all change to go with a dress that works for your figure, it may just switch to a dress that doesn't work for someone else's figure who is a very small size. Personally I like it when brides pick a color and a designer and a length and then there is some room for bridesmaids to pick a dress that is flattering for their body type. But it is what it is.", "NTA.  I think you were being really gracious.  That said, if it is more important to her that you be in the wedding than not she should compromise on the dress.  Perhaps you could have it tailored or use some undergarments that would make you feel more comfortable in it (I too am a plus size woman and honestly my undergarments make a huge difference in how I feel in things)", "Nta. You handled it graciously and it sounds like the other bridesmaids need to be more accommodating so the bride can have you in the wedding wearing a dress which makes you comfortable.", "NAH -  doesn\u2019t sound like we\u2019re in bridezilla territory and it sound like she genuinely wants you to be part of the bridal party.\n\nCan you consult with a seamstress to see if the dress the other bridesmaids want can be altered to fit and be more flattering for your body type?\n\nI was pregnant and due two weeks before being a bridesmaid.  We ordered the dress two sizes up from my norm just in case I was still pregnant for the wedding.  I gave birth two weeks early.

I know down is easier than up with size, but a good seamstress may be able to help.", "YTA - \n\nthe BRIDE was okay with the second dress not matching. \n\nThat was already very very nice of her (compared to most similar stories lol) to not mind messing with the aesthetic to accommodate your comfy-ness. And now she\u2019s probably panicking that she feels like she has to change the entire dress idea for everyone.\n\nDon\u2019t let her turn into a people pleaser on her special day, this isn\u2019t about you and what YOU think the dresses should look like. She was fine with you wearing a different dress that was a slightly different color cause she knows it fit better, you should have left it at that. \n\nAll that aside, no matter what happens, all of you will look beautiful so just go with what\u2019s easiest for HER.", "NTA \n\nI think the bride is embarrassing herself when she wants to choose for one of her bridesmaids to be highlighted as not fitting in with the others by either having to choose between a dress 2 sizes too small or a completely different dress to the others. It will just tell all her guests how little she cares for you imperticular, whether that is true or not. Why would you accept being treated that way when you just want to show up and be happy for your brother?\n\nI think you are very nice in the way you stand firm while still seeing the good in the bride.", "YTA. The wedding isn\u2019t about you so expecting the bridal party to change completely to accommodate is unreasonable given that the bride is clearly okay with your dress being a little different.", "YTA\n\nJust go with it.  It's your brother's day.  Not yours.  They wanted you to be a bridesmaid because its important to your brother, family, etc.\n\nPretty much every girl in the world has to wear a bridesmaid dress they don't like. Just run with it, change out after dinner if you must.", "YTA . Get the 18 and have adjustments made that make it flattering to your tastes. You can have panels added, etc. that way you have the same color at least. Right now you sound hard to please when she already tried to accommodate you.", "YTA. You have every right to feel comfortable in your dress, both in how it looks, and how it feels. But when she offered a second option, you should\u2019ve just gone with it.\n\nIf anything, YOU should be the one looking for new dresses.

I think that idea makes her really uncomfortable/self-conscious.", "Also, the bride should just stop worrying about what specific dress everyone else wants.

If she went with the modern trend of telling everyone a size/length but letting them pick their own dresses it would solve the problem. Even if all the other bridesmaids picked tight dresses they almost certainly wouldn't all pick the exact same dress, and therefore op would no longer stick out as the one person in a different dress.", "I wore a Cedric the Entertainer style FUBU tuxedo to a wedding. It was not my first choice and I felt ridiculous. \n\nThat said, it is perfectly okay to choose not to be in the wedding party. If the bride just let OP choose her own dress in the same color scheme that should be cool. The bride doesn't need to choose and order the dress.", "I agree. My spouse and I are in a wedding later this year. They chosen shirt for groomsmen does not fit him well. Ok in the neck and arms, but he can't bend is arms. The bride said for him to get one he is comfortable wearing, in the same colour. We went shopping and sent her photos of the options. She said whichever he prefers. Not everyone cares about the aesthetic, its important to have those close to them with them on their day.", "Hmmmm, definitely agree. Is there any ideas on the placement of everyone? Maybe they could do it in a way where it looks like you\u2019re \u201cnext in line\u201d with maid of honor?

You have the right to be concerned about how you appear, but she's shouldn't have to completely change all the dresses to accommodate you.   It comes down to how much you're willing to compromise.  She seems to really want you in the wedding, how much do you feel the need to make her happy?  If you care about her enough, then it's just one day.  Hopefully, everyone will be looking at her.  Can you change for the reception?", "NTA. When I got married I chose a colour palate and let them decide which shade of reddish pinks looked best on their skin tone, and then said as long as it\u2019s floor length, choose what you want for style up top.

Once she gets photos back, unfortunately she may not be so fine. \n\nI appreciate this may sound insensitive, although I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m posing a strategy to further make your point to her.  Can you all get together and do a group photo in the dress?  Even if a different colour, but available size and style.  It may help her consider other options, either dress choices or the offer to fulfil another role in the ceremony.", "If it were me I would step back. Making it clear there is no ill will.", "NTA.

Factor in that plus size is nearly always so much more expensive limiting what we can usually find that fits all our criterias is super hard. \n\nYou're not in the wrong for not being happy with the choices she's picked as it seems she's very much only considered what the others want. Even if it's only a slightly different colour it doesn't change that it's not in unison with the other dresses and that it will actually single you out and highlight your differences to the others. \n\nShe doesn't seem to have listened to anything you've brought up and it's all well and good her saying she's struggling to find a dress for everyone but it sounds like she hasn't even really tried yes it is her wedding blah blah blah but you shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable just to accommodate her and the others and shouldn't have to suck anything up. \n\nYou've been nothing but nice about the situation and accommodating even trying on a dress SHE knew only went up to an 18 so no if she can't even come up with a solution that makes you all happy not just the others who she seems to favour then why should you have to endure something that makes you uncomfortable. \n\nI would suggest maybe speaking to your brother you said you were very close, explain the situation and how you feel and say you're happy she asked but every suggestion you've made has been pushed to the side so you'd rather attend as a guest and find something that makes you feel and look beautiful without having to compromise on what you're comfortable in.", "YTA for not accepting the second option in a slightly different colour. As long as they are complimentary, it would not look out of place. Obviously you cannot wear a dress that is a couple of sizes too small. You have to be willing to meet the bride half way.", "NTA\n\nThe dress does not come in your size. Stepping down and coming as a well-dressed guest is probably best for you.", "NTA. You gave her plenty of reasonable options and she sounds wrapped up in her own wedding world vision.  However, because you said you love your brother like you say you do and I can see you want to make this work, I would make one more attempt and take the size 18 dress to a seamstress and see if they can put in panels or expanders.  If that fails I would talk to your brother and explain how you love and support him but walk him through the situation where you don't want to be uncomfortable being up on stage in a too tight garment (heaven forbid it rips!), or in a different dress where you stand out starkly from everyone else.  If he is as good of a bro as you say he will talk to his fiance and figure out a solution, either advocating for getting a bridesmaid dress that works or supporting you coming just as a guest.  You sound like a lovely person so I hope it all works out.", "NTA.  You should have something comfortable and that fits you.  Your offer to step down was lovely and she had a good route to make it a win-win.  I would tell her that you aren't comfortable being a bridesmaid but you can do a reading or something else to be a part of the celebration.", "NTA you gave a nice solution as you don't want her to stress out. You are being very considerate. I suggest giving her one more with suggesting a color and length and letting everyone pick their own styles. Afterwards explain how you don't want he to dress because of you and that's why you offered to step down.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nMy wife and I took a simple approach as well. We bought her bridesmaids matching shoes and told them they can pick their own dress as long as it's black (we ran an ivory and black color scheme.)

All the big bridesmaid dress makers have that option. I hope OP stands her ground, because it's not just one day of feeling uncomfortable, it's also the pictures that will be around forever, possibly hanging up in her brother's house (or until the marriage fails.)", "Same, I had 2 maids (and a bridesman/Man of Honor but he was in a suit so he's not relevant to this story) who could not have had more different body types than if I had *tried* to arrange it that way. No matter what, what looked good on one would look ghastly or tacky on the other.\n\nSo I showed them the designer website and said \"I want this length and this color from this material. Everything else is up to you.\"\n\nThey were very happy and they both looked just lovely in a style that worked with their body. Honestly, I think everyone should do it this way. Having *exact* identical looks/dresses/makeup and hairstyles looks weird to me, and I tend to be very particular and organized myself. I think it's because I know these are people, not props, and unique little variations is part of what makes people beautiful and unique.\n\nAnyways, I'm happy I did it that way and believe me, they were too, there was no way I was going to find one dress that looked good on both of them and they were both very nervous about it. I liked having genuine smiles in my pictures knowing my friends were comfortable and having a good time.", "I think this is the best idea, each person is comfortable, but no one stands out because colour and length is the same", "When my bridesmaid dress didn't fit and we couldn't get a bigger one I removed the zipper and put in a corset back. A tailor could do that as well because it was very simple.", "As for #1, at a wedding I was in a bridesmaid did that, and she was able to order extra fabric from the brand to add to the dress. But the seamstress she took it to didn't alter the dress such that it looked like it was the same dress the rest of us had. (Honestly, it looked more fashion forward.) So if the bride wants all matching dresses, this isn't a great option. (The bride for this wedding didn't care and covered the dresses as our gift, so the extra costs didn't hurt that bridesmaid.) Also, not all dresses size up well, especially if you've got a larger bust.", "As a busty woman, adding a panel does not make it work.  Form fitting dresses just do not look good on us.  Plus they are more than uncomfortable.  They can cause major skin irritation and rashes.", "No the bride offered to let OP wear a different dress in OPs size that fit.

OP declined.", "I've seen some amazing alterations (via instagram) where the seamstress has opened up the side seams to add inserts (which add inches around the circumference), as well as changing the back zipper to a lace-up back.  OP, if this is an option, I would ask the dress store if it's possible to get the extra fabric (1-2 yards) or if you can get a discount on an extra dress (although, the dressmaker might be able to use a coordinating fabric from Jo\\*anns.  I'm not even sure about to deal with the paying for the alterations.). Good luck, OP!", "You\u2019re right - I misread.

It\u2019s actually a good solution.", "Huh, must've misread it the first time, I thought it was the bride that wanted all the dresses to match.", "This seems wildly impractical and ignorant. There is no amount of seam allowance to turn a fashion 18 into a regular size 22. This would require completely remaking the dress on OP's expense.", "Still will show every little bulge.", "You're right I forgot about that but it isn't a perfect dupe either.

Furthermore, if you work in bridal, you should know that she isn't just sizing down a size- paneling for at least 4 sizes too small is a different ballgame. That's not going to look good with a lot of dresses, and would cost a pretty penny, assuming the seamstress can get enough material in the same color and feel comfortable essentially remaking the dress. There's a lot of seamstresses that would straight up refuse.\n\nOP's solution was reasonable. If they can't find a dress they like that comes in her size, OP steps back as a bridesmaid. That's absolutely fine.", "I\u2019ve literally done it multiple times, but go off. The seam allowance can vary wildly, and while I don\u2019t think it will cover all of the extra fabric needed, it\u2019s helpful to know how much additional fabric would be needed and how feasible the project is. I\u2019ve had some gowns with a good 2 inches in the seam allowance, which can be surprisingly helpful. This is based on my impression from OP that the bust is the most problematic area. I went into more detail on my main comment.", "If the bride doesn\u2019t mind it not being a perfect dupe, I don\u2019t see why OP should. Being a bridesmaid means doing what the bride wants within reason. Bride has found a compromise and OP is still refusing. I think OP needs to admit to herself she isn\u2019t as comfortable with her body as she claims, and admit to the bride she actually doesn\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid.", "At that point you are making the wedding/bridesmaid dress about you. \n\nNot wanting to wear a dress that does not fit you/your size totally reasonable.

OP is likely concerned that she will stand out more because of the differences, which would also make the poor fit more noticeable. As a different size from the other bridesmaids, I\u2019m sure it would be awkward to be wearing an obviously sub par dress in an obviously sub par fit- she would stand out in a bad way.

My parents love showing off pictures of me in my wedding dress, and all I can see is where the bodice molds to my rolls.  And this was a custom dress!\n\nIt does suck that the other bridesmaids tried it on and made their decision without you.\n\nIf the bridesmaids' dresses are from one of the big chains, there's a good chance that additional fabric to match can be ordered in.  One of my bridesmaids is not a dress person, so when we bought the other two dresses, I inquired about the feasibility of buying matching fabric to have a suit made for her.

I\u2019d say half of her bridesmaids were plus size (including me), and it just felt like she did this purposely to make us look bad. It\u2019s their wedding day, but why would you want your closest friends standing by your side, and in photos looking unflattering/bad?

I'm sure the bride-to-be is stressed with wedding planning, but she can't possibly expect you to wear either (option A) a dress that doesn't fit you or (option B) a dress that is a different color/style than the other bridesmaids' dresses. If she doesn't like your offer to be a guest instead, then she needs to pick a new dress that works for everyone.", "I had this same issue.

Theres nothing else you can do, its up to her to decide, you wont magically lose that much wait till then, i mean in an healthy way.", "NTA.  I chose a color for dresses and a color for shoes.
