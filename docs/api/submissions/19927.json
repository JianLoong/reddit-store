I get along very well with his partner and accepted to be their bridesmaid when asked. However, when it came to talk about dresses I was worried as I\u2019m a much bigger girl than her and all of the other bridesmaids. For context, I\u2019m about a size 20/22 whereas the others are a size 12 or smaller. I am okay with my body although I am trying to lose some weight. However, due to my size I always try to dress in ways that flatter my shape and stay clear of anything that\u2019s tight. When I was asked to be a bridesmaid I mentioned that I\u2019d really want a dress that isn\u2019t super tight so I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable all day and not be happy at my brothers special day. Well she ordered a dress that all the other bridesmaids tried on and liked however, the biggest size that it came in was a 18. I offered to try it on to try and be accommodating however even though I could get it on it was super unflattering and was way too tight in the bust area. She then found a similar dress that came in bigger size however it was a slightly different colour. I tried it on but mentioned that being up there with all the other bridesmaids in slightly different dress might not look the best. I said I would prefer if she looks at other dresses and maybe some that were a bit more loose and came in all sizes so I could have the same as every one. However, the other bridesmaids all want something more fitting to their bodies. I also said that if she liked the dress that all the other bridesmaids liked then I\u2019m happy for her to choose that one and I would step back at being a bridesmaid. That way I can choose a lovely guest dress and just me being at there big day is enough for me. She said she really wants me to be a bridesmaid but is struggling to find a dress for everyone and is upset that I offered to not be a bridesmaid. AITA for not just accepting the dress that the others liked and should I just suck up having to wear a dress that shows all my rolls off", "created_utc": 1687038877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c2xbi/aita_for_not_wanting_to_wear_the_bridesmaid_dress/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were being thoughtful of the situation.", "My bridesmaids were a size 00, a size 8, a size 10 and a size 22.

This isn't hard and I find it really rude that they chose a dress that doesn't even come in a 20. NTA.", "NTA. It is NOT that hard to find bridesmaid dresses that come in plus sizes, especially a size 20-22. She was inconsiderate not to even consider dresses that wouldn\u2019t fit you.", "NAH. If I understand correctly, the dress she wants doesn't even fit you. Either way, having to wear something that makes you physically uncomfortable is different from not wanting to wear a dress because you think it's ugly or tacky (as most bridesmaid dresses are). It was generous of you to offer stepping down, though I can understand her frustration in wanting you to be involved, too. I hope you can jointly find a solution.", "NAH, but a couple of suggestions:\n- See whether a tailor can add a panel to the bust of the original dress. You\u2019d be surprised at what can be done. There\u2019s probably also a little bit of the dress fabric available on the interior, but if you need it hemmed, then that fabric could possibly also be used. \n- Step back as a bridesmaid but offer to do a reading or something of that nature. You could wear a coordinating dress and still be part of the wedding, but no one would think twice about your being in a different dress. I wouldn\u2019t push this point, there are a lot of variables, but it may not hurt to bring it up.\n\nETA \u2013 A third suggestion:\nCall the company that makes the dress, and see whether they have any suggestions.", "NTA.

She's entitled to do that to an extent, as it is her wedding day.\n\nHowever, your concern with the dress she chose is completely understandable.\n\nIt's unfair for her to get \"upset\" that you offered to not be a bridesmaid. Just as it's unreasonable for her to expect you to magically fit in a dress two sizes smaller than what you normally wear.\n\nMy honest take is that she expects you to wear the too small, massively unflattering dress that her friends like.", "Normally, I\u2019m the first person to say \u201cYou agreed to be a bridesmaid.

If you do not want be a bridesmaid, then you should be able to bow out of the role and the responsibilities.  If you want to be a bridesmaid, then I'm wondering if there is another solution: can you get the best-fitting size of the dress altered to fit?  If the dress is unflattering because it's in the wrong size/too small, this might be a solution.", "NTA, being up there in a dress that doesn't fit seems like a worse look than having a slightly different style of dress from the other bridesmaids.", "You are the shape you are. You'd like a dress that flatters your shape. The other bridesmaids would like dresses that flatter them. You and they are very different shapes, and aren't flattered by the same dress.

I\u2019m in a 20 dress in a few weeks, the other bridesmaids are a 12,8 &6!  We all have the same colour dress but slightly different styles to flatter us all!  I could physically but wear the same dress in a bigger size as the others as it wouldn\u2019t look good and I\u2019d be uncomfortable.  You did the right throng in offering to step down.", "NTA - You\u2019re trying your best.", "Seems the choices are, the tight matching dress, a non matching dress that fits and is cute or you go as a guest.\n\nConsidering they like the dress you can\u2019t fit, seems the choice is a dress that\u2019s slightly different but cute and in your size. Pick a pretty dress in the wedding colors and call it a day. In my opinion.\n\nAt this point matching isn\u2019t as important at you standing up for your friend.\n\nNAH", "NTA. You\u2019ve handled this very reasonably. The bride can either find a dress that accommodates all of you in the sizes you come in, or gets used to the idea that you won\u2019t be one of her bridesmaids.", "NTA\n\nI would be uncomfortable in an unflattering dress too. Can you find out the designer / color and order something from the same bridal shop that's in the same color (or a very similar color) but in a style that is flattering to your figure and in the correct size? Your dress doesn't need to be the exact same style as everyone else's. No one is going to be taking notes on all the bridesmaids. They will be looking at the bride. You will be up there looking and feeling confident in your awesome dress. It will be great!\n\nI'm not sure that asking the rest of the bridesmaids to change dresses so that you can all match is the answer. If everyone in the wedding party is a very different size, it's unlikely there is any one dress out there that is going to flatter everyone's figure anyway. If they all change to go with a dress that works for your figure, it may just switch to a dress that doesn't work for someone else's figure who is a very small size. Personally I like it when brides pick a color and a designer and a length and then there is some room for bridesmaids to pick a dress that is flattering for their body type. But it is what it is.", "NTA.  I think you were being really gracious.  That said, if it is more important to her that you be in the wedding than not she should compromise on the dress.  Perhaps you could have it tailored or use some undergarments that would make you feel more comfortable in it (I too am a plus size woman and honestly my undergarments make a huge difference in how I feel in things)", "Nta. You handled it graciously and it sounds like the other bridesmaids need to be more accommodating so the bride can have you in the wedding wearing a dress which makes you comfortable.", "NAH -  doesn\u2019t sound like we\u2019re in bridezilla territory and it sound like she genuinely wants you to be part of the bridal party.\n\nCan you consult with a seamstress to see if the dress the other bridesmaids want can be altered to fit and be more flattering for your body type?\n\nI was pregnant and due two weeks before being a bridesmaid.  We ordered the dress two sizes up from my norm just in case I was still pregnant for the wedding.  I gave birth two weeks early.  Seamstress had me pinned, fitted and the dress altered to be quite flattering on my post-baby body.  I know down is easier than up with size, but a good seamstress may be able to help.", "YTA - \n\nthe BRIDE was okay with the second dress not matching. \n\nThat was already very very nice of her (compared to most similar stories lol) to not mind messing with the aesthetic to accommodate your comfy-ness. And now she\u2019s probably panicking that she feels like she has to change the entire dress idea for everyone.\n\nDon\u2019t let her turn into a people pleaser on her special day, this isn\u2019t about you and what YOU think the dresses should look like. She was fine with you wearing a different dress that was a slightly different color cause she knows it fit better, you should have left it at that. \n\nAll that aside, no matter what happens, all of you will look beautiful so just go with what\u2019s easiest for HER.", "NTA \n\nI think the bride is embarrassing herself when she wants to choose for one of her bridesmaids to be highlighted as not fitting in with the others by either having to choose between a dress 2 sizes too small or a completely different dress to the others. It will just tell all her guests how little she cares for you imperticular, whether that is true or not. Why would you accept being treated that way when you just want to show up and be happy for your brother?\n\nI think you are very nice in the way you stand firm while still seeing the good in the bride.", "YTA. The wedding isn\u2019t about you so expecting the bridal party to change completely to accommodate is unreasonable given that the bride is clearly okay with your dress being a little different.", "YTA\n\nJust go with it.  It's your brother's day.  Not yours.  They wanted you to be a bridesmaid because its important to your brother, family, etc.\n\nPretty much every girl in the world has to wear a bridesmaid dress they don't like. Just run with it, change out after dinner if you must.", "YTA . Get the 18 and have adjustments made that make it flattering to your tastes. You can have panels added, etc. that way you have the same color at least. Right now you sound hard to please when she already tried to accommodate you.", "YTA. You have every right to feel comfortable in your dress, both in how it looks, and how it feels. But when she offered a second option, you should\u2019ve just gone with it.\n\nIf anything, YOU should be the one looking for new dresses. And you have no right to ask her to change the dresses for all the other bridesmaids. Understandably, you would want one that is the same color.

Frankly, it's generous of you to step aside and ask for a different role.\n\nHowever, there's a couple of solutions:\n\n1.  Take the dress to a tailor and see if they can somehow add a panel, etc.\n2. Ask the dress manufacturer if you can BUY THEIR FABRIC and have a dress made.  Yes, most bridesmaid companies have this as an option.", "NTA\n\nYou offered a fair alternative. You and the other bridesmaids have significantly different tastes in clothing. You know what flatters your figure and it isn't what they are choosing. The alternative won't look right in pictures and you are trying to help with that as well. You can still enjoy the wedding as a guest and it will ultimately avoid unnecessary stress for everyone. Otherwise, you'll keep having to point out that the chosen dress just isn't going to work and the other ladies may become resentful.\n\nLet her know that you didn't intend any harm.

You are happy to help and participate in the celebrations and greatly look forward to the coming day.", "NTA - I sewed bridesmaids dresses for my niece\u2019s wedding. There was a wide range of sizes. I found a pattern that had several different  ways of making the dress and each bridesmaid picked what they liked best. The key to coordinating was we used the same fabric for everyone. The bride is the A H here for not working with the dress shop - or a seamstress to choose coordinating dresses that everyone can wear. You are a class act OP-probably best to bow out.", "As a person with a larger body, the problem with #1 is cost.

Op has given her an nice easy compromise that gives her friends the dress they want, the bride is a fool to not accept.", "This \u2013 OP, would it be possible to have a tailor add in an extra panel around the bust?", "I agree with some of your post. However, I don\u2019t think the bride was being \u201cnice\u201d by allowing her to wear a different dress. She shouldn\u2019t be expected to be uncomfortable, especially when part of it is physical. But yes, I think the OP fucked up by not accepting the second option.", "I don't think OP wants to say it directly, but I think she might feel a little ashamed/embarrassed if she is the only one out of the bridal party wearing a different dress. It kind of makes it obvious that OP couldn't fit into the dress. I think that idea makes her really uncomfortable/self-conscious.", "Also, the bride should just stop worrying about what specific dress everyone else wants. However she SHOULD make sure whatever dress she chooses has the size range that her bridesmaids need. \n\nThe point of a bridesmaid is not to get to wear a cute dress that YOU want, it\u2019s to look good next to the bride and match the aesthetic/color scheme. However again, the dresses should fit everyone, and obviously not be unreasonable (like a latex cocktail dress or something lol)", "This is a bad take.

Not exactly ok. This is not a reasonable solution at all", "Bride has no right to demand op preform as a bridesmaid.", "I mentioned that in another comment. It may. Before I got too stressed out about it, I\u2019d take it to a good tailor who knows how to work on formal dresses, and find out whether there\u2019s any seam allowance and/or if the side seams have been clipped. It\u2019s good to know for sure what you\u2019re working with. \n\nA third suggestion:\nCall the company that makes the dress, and see whether they have any suggestions.", "Can you afford a second dress to get the material needed to alter the dress?", "Yeah \u201cnice\u201d wasn\u2019t the right word. Having a dress that fits is definitely expected. Most brides would throw a fit if someone suggested a different dress was my main point (which isn\u2019t okay, just the usual reaction from brides hahaha)", "I totally understand that and would probably feel the same way, but I personally would comfort myself with the fact that there\u2019s mismatched bridesmaids dresses all the time, and they\u2019ll probably arrange them in a way that it looks purposeful. \n\nI\u2019ve also seen people pick a color, and then everyone gets different dresses but the same exact color (hard to do, but fun) \n\nAll in all I really think as long as the bride isn\u2019t an unreasonable one, give her what she wants.\n\n(Obviously some people are very different, some wouldn\u2019t mind feeling like they might look silly for their friend/family, some would have lots of anxiety over it, I guess it depends who you are, and who\u2019s wedding it is.

It sounds like the bride is trying to please everyone and it is impossible. \n\nThe other bridesmaids wanted a fitted dress? Who cares? Everyone knows being a bridesmaid sucks and you jump through hoops which you would never otherwise do. It sounds like the bride is being steamrolled and the bridesmaids are being a PITA.", "I just think bowing out of someone\u2019s wedding who is important to you and clearly wants you there (is putting design choices on the back burner so her friend is comfy, let be real, how many modern brides do that?) because you aren\u2019t confident in the dress (not the one that literally doesn\u2019t fit, that\u2019s obviously an issue) is a bit unnecessary, and I\u2019d be upset if a friend/close family did that during my wedding planning. \n\nHowever, I also would wear whatever my friend wants, even if it was ridiculous and ugly, it\u2019s her special day. So maybe I\u2019m not the best to be giving an opinion lol.", "Did they specify what the fianc\u00e9 wants the dresses to look like? I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s relevant.\n\nIf a groomsman posted with the same issue, I\u2019d say the same thing. Wear the mismatched tux if groom is fine with that.", "You would be surprised.", "Why?", "Most bridesmaid dresses and designed and made with future tailoring in mind, so it\u2019s probably not as unrealistic as you\u2019d think.", "I worked in bridal, many times bridesmaids would order too small against our advice and our seamstress would have to make alterations best they could. It would be the same color which OP was concerned about. She wasn\u2019t concerned about having the exact same dress.", "OP is a bridesmaid.", "That would be more ideal, but I was trying not to make assumptions. \n\nIf buying a second dress for the fabric makes the tailor\u2019s job significantly easier, then the cost difference may be a wash. \n\nI also think she can\u2019t get this day back and should proceed accordingly if these relationships are important to her.", "I completely agree with what you are saying and would happily wear a dress that is mismatched in styles or colours if everyone was. But all the other bridesmaids were having the same dress in the same colour but me as it did not come in my size. I would feel very embarrassed and uncomfortable to be the only bridesmaid out of 7 of us to be in a different dress", "It's not even impossible! If she went with the modern trend of telling everyone a size/length but letting them pick their own dresses it would solve the problem. Even if all the other bridesmaids picked tight dresses they almost certainly wouldn't all pick the exact same dress, and therefore op would no longer stick out as the one person in a different dress.", "I wore a Cedric the Entertainer style FUBU tuxedo to a wedding. It was not my first choice and I felt ridiculous. \n\nThat said, it is perfectly okay to choose not to be in the wedding party. If the bride just let OP choose her own dress in the same color scheme that should be cool. The bride doesn't need to choose and order the dress.", "I agree. My spouse and I are in a wedding later this year. They chosen shirt for groomsmen does not fit him well. Ok in the neck and arms, but he can't bend is arms. The bride said for him to get one he is comfortable wearing, in the same colour. We went shopping and sent her photos of the options. She said whichever he prefers. Not everyone cares about the aesthetic, its important to have those close to them with them on their day.", "Hmmmm, definitely agree. Is there any ideas on the placement of everyone? Maybe they could do it in a way where it looks like you\u2019re \u201cnext in line\u201d with maid of honor? Or right in the middle as a contrast (an maybe middle groomsman has a mismatched tux?) idk, now IM  the one making it too complicated\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02", "I meant it is impossible the way she is trying to do it, but yes. It may be that she is traditional and wants everyone in the same style, but if she was OK with the one dress not matching, I doubt it.", "Very true. It\u2019s a touchy one, lots of \u201cright\u201d answers and feelings to be considered."]}
