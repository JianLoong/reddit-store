I'm a SAHM to our toddler daughter and am currently 9 months pregnant. \n\n\nWell, we made it to full term and I am just DONE. I am tired, uncomfortable, been having insomnia, contractions pretty much every day since the 3rd trimester started, and the baby LOVES to push his head down to the point that I think he's going to eject himself. \n\nWhen the baby tries to eject himself, it tends to make me need the bathroom. Pronto.\n\nWhich is what led to this post. \n\nMy husband recently joined a martial arts program to try to lose weight. It's something he had been interested in for years and finally got up the courage to join. The man works 10 hour days and was in desperate need of a hobby. \n\nHe's a great dad and hopes our kids will join him in the art when they are old enough. But this is something he needed to do for himself. \n\nThe downside is, he's in a rush when he gets home from work on training days. \nHe rushes in door, greets us, hops in the shower (we have 2 bathrooms), and leaves. \n\nToday, while my husband was still in the bathroom, lil man decided practice ejection again. I had to pee, BADLY afterward. I rushed to our bedroom bathroom, locking the bedroom door behind me out of habit. Our toddler loves to follow me everywhere and I am trying to teach her to respect closed doors and personal space, we don't have a door for our bathroom, just a curtain. \n\nWell, I didn't know my husband was so close to leaving the main bathroom when I needed to pee, i felt like i was about wet myself. \nThe next thing i knew, i heard him trying to open the door and then pounded on it. \n\nI called out apologies and hurriedly wiped, flushed, and opened the door for him. I wasn't even done.\n\nHe berated me for locking the door, citing that I knew he was in a hurry. \n\nNow, key point. Sometimes, more often than not lately, I poop when I pee. It just comes out. I can't control it. I sit, pee, thinking that's all I need to do, but then, nope. Poop crashes the pool party. \n\nMy husband is grossed out that I pooped this time, because he wanted to brush his teeth before going since this particular martial arts involves wrestling, so he wants to be polite, hence the shower as well. \n\nI let out an exasperated sigh and snapped that I didn't mean to and and i didn't know he was going to brush his teeth. I slammed the bedroom door behind as I left so I could finish in the main bathroom. \n\nI probably could have handled it better but I am so tired and cranky anymore. I was still stormy when he kissed me goodbye before leaving. \n\nSo, am I asshole here? Could i have tried to wait for him to come out before rushing to ours?\n\nUpdate: he apologized almost immediately upon walking in the door after returning home from training. He said he was \"being a grouch\" and \"you know how I get when I feel rushed, not that it's an excuse.\"\nWe're all good now, thank you all for making me feel sane.

If I started a poop during a pee, I'd expect some teasing from my husband, but you can't help your bodily functions, especially during 3rd trimester.
