Does she not want to have any kind of relationship with one of the most important people in her best friend's life? and why us she trying to blame you because she can't speak up and why is your bf going along with it instead of sticking up for you when you clearly did nothing wrong and are not a mind reader.", "You did not do anything wrong.

Also my first time to ask here.\n\nMy (33F) boyfriend (47M) and I have been dating for about a year. He has this best friend (33F) he would hang out with maybe once or twice a month. And he would tell me wonderful things about her and she sounded cool, like she\u2019s someone I could get along with even though we haven\u2019t met. I\u2019m normally shy around other people but sometimes when I like their vibe I\u2019m kind of like an excited puppy about them.\n\nI don\u2019t live with my boyfriend and we would maybe see each other once a week, as we usually work from home and our office days don\u2019t always match up. (We work in different companies but also on the same street)\n\nIt turned out he had planned to meet up with his best friend in city and I was also around. So I asked if I could say hi and they were ok with it.\n\nBoyfriend and I were free at 5 pm and his best friend wouldn\u2019t get to the bar til past 6. He and I hung out a good hour and I had a couple of drinks already and quite drunk.\n\nThen his best friend arrives. I thought we instantly clicked. I was still halfway through my current drink when she got there so I didn\u2019t really leave right away as I planned.\n\nI had expressed my intention to leave a few times but I kind of got dragged into the conversations and I thought we were having fun.\n\nThen we moved onto a restaurant. I took that as a cue to leave. Then my boyfriend and his best friend asked if I was hungry. And honestly I was starved. I had such a busy work day I only managed to eat a sandwich. So they invited me to eat with them. I could have probably eaten elsewhere myself but it looked like they wanted me around since they invited me.\n\nWorth pointing out I wasn\u2019t PDA with my boyfriend. No kisses or whatever. I did more listening and I watched them banter. I was enjoying but getting conscious about me overstaying. I didn\u2019t even finish my cocktail when I finally packed up to go around 7:45 pm so they can have their time.\n\nLater on I get a text from my boyfriend 9 pm that he\u2019s on the train. I thought it was awfully early for him to go, so I checked if something was up.\n\nOnly when I pressed one more time did he say that his best friend get like a third wheel and wasn\u2019t able to tell him things cause I was there. So she got another friend to come pick her up. \n\nThey pretty much parted right after I left. Think she got upset with him.\n\nI told my boyfriend I wished he somehow communicated with me about needing more time with his best friend, I would have understood. But he thinks I wouldn\u2019t have taken it well (and this is the part that also hurt me \u2014 but that\u2019s beside the point of this post).\n\nBoyfriend says it\u2019s all good, not a big deal, and wants to move on. He said he\u2019s already made up with his best friend.\n\nAITA? How could I have done better? Any advice how I can move on? I\u2019m so guilty and sad and i feel like it\u2019s not resolved for me but I don\u2019t wanna bother my boyfriend either.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Friend was pissed and left the restaurant rightaway. Of course you bf couldn't tell you the true that he wants to also fuck his bff, so he came up with this lame story in which you had all the blame. Especially because this will hinder you to contact the bff and find out what he did because you know think that you annoyed her / she can't stand you.", "NAH - you made moves to leave them to do their thing and they dragged you along. I don't think there was anything wrong with meeting up with your BF beforehand as it seemed to work out for both of you but next time stick to leaving when you finish your drink or better yet, move to water in the last 15-30 minutes before the other person shows up and you bow out.", "Thank you", "His best friend sounds jelly.", "The correct judgment then is NAH. NTA implies another party is the AH.", "Also, are you sure the friend said those things?  I think the BF doesn't want these two people hanging out and is sowing dissention.", "Nah.  My money is on boyfriend wants to have the friend as a sidepiece option, and that's more difficult if she's friends with the gf, so he's trying to keep them apart.", "NTA. Something smells funny here. You should not feel guilty as they asked you to stay and eat. I'm getting a someone's cheating vibe.", "> AITA? How could I have done better? Any advice how I can move on? I\u2019m so guilty and sad and i feel like it\u2019s not resolved for me but I don\u2019t wanna bother my boyfriend either.\n\n> Boyfriend says it\u2019s all good, not a big deal, and wants to move on. He said he\u2019s already made up with his best friend.\n\nYou're literally creating a conflict where the person involved is telling you there isn't one. There was a miscommunication earlier which has now been cleared up and no one is upset other than you. Just move on and remember in the future that bf and friend apparently need to be alone when they get together. That's it.", "You made every effort to be conscious of his right to some personal time with a friend.  They chose not to take you up on it.  Then later his \"friend\" threw some kind of guilt party for him because he didn't read her mind?  Plus he's trying to gaslight you into being the offending party, instead of her.  I'd be very distrusting of that relationship going forward.  They don't behave like friends, and they're both bad at communicating.  NTA", "I can see I'm going against the grain here but ESH. \n\nIt was impolite for you to ask to tag along initially. If he wanted you to join them, he would have asked you. Even if he suspected his friend would prefer to talk in private, he likely felt that he couldn't say no without it seeming suspicious. There was no gracious way for them to ask you to leave the bar, and it would have been rude not to invite you to dinner. I think you misread the room, you should have left after saying hi as initially planned.\n\nAll that being said, it *is* suspicious that this 47yo man has a 33yo girlfriend and a 33yo female best friend, even if he's not cheating there's something up with this guy. You can do better.", "NTA but are you sure you're not just a booty call?  Once a week meet ups and you don't really know his best friend?", "NTA! you were invited along, you just need to be like Elsa and let it go. If they are good, it's fine.", "Stop beating yourself up over this.  It's not a big deal & you're making it out to be more than it is.  Your boyfriend is over it & you should be too.  You did nothing wrong.  They invited you to eat dinner with them.  I suppose you could have politely declined, but how are you to know they don't want you there if they're inviting you to stay?", "INFO:   \n\n\n>I had expressed my intention to leave a few times but I kind of got dragged into the conversations  \nmy boyfriend and his best friend asked if I was hungry / they invited me to eat with them  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>his best friend get like a third wheel and wasn\u2019t able to tell him things cause I was there  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>They pretty much parted right after I left\n\nthis doesn't add up. if the friend felt too constrained by you, why keep inviting you to stay? why leave shortly after you leave since now she could open properly? i absolutely think there's something else going on.\n\nmaybe ask your boyfriend for his friend's info so you can message her yourself to apologize for what your boyfriend said the problem is.", "I picked up those vibes too. I do find it odd that a 47 year old man\u2019s best friend is a 33 year old woman, and can\u2019t help wondering if there\u2019s more to the relationship, or if one of them is being friendly in hopes of something more. They could just be friends, of course, but the age difference (and the fact that this woman is OP\u2019s age) is a little sus.", "Very. 14yr age gap sounds wrong.", "I mean neither of them can be upset with you, when they literally invited you to dinner, when you were ready to leave. So thats on them. Sure you could have left anyways but she might have taken that as being rude. \n\nThis sounds like a no win situation.", "She honestly just sounds jealous that she can't occupy his attention all the time.", "Some of you people are really weird with the age differences. They are all legal consenting adults. Find something else to harp on.", "lol reach of the century, and all ur replies want the BF to be cheating so bad. what a loser", "I can't get over the age gap. Both ladies are 14yrs younger, 47yr old man with a 33yr female best friend just sounds weird nvm the a 33yr old girlfriend.", "And you think it's NOT reaching that this woman who was happily hanging out with OP and invited her to dinner with them all of a sudden did a complete 180 turn and left because of OP... and did it after OP had already left?  She was perfectly happy to hang out with OP, but once she gets alone with the friend is like \"well now that we're alone I'm leaving because we weren't alone earlier?\n\nNah, homie.   Something don't add up.\n\nAlso why are you so angry that the BF\"s shady behavior is brought up?  Are you him?", "I never said he was cheating. I just believe there is more than meets the eye. It\u2019s a little fishy.", "I never intended to reply to you, your reply was respectful, i\u2019m here for other dweeb"]}
