{"id": 8836, "submission_id": "10qqvsu", "title": "AITA for telling my BIL to get over himself and to quit holding a 10 year old grudge?", "selftext": "My BIL (married to my sister) is a general contractor. About 10 years ago, my dad and brother was building a deck at my parent\u2019s home. They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no. They prepared the ground as best they could without the skid loader but got to the point they couldn\u2019t go on without it. They went to my sis\u2019s house to ask again but found out BIL went out of town. They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot and they hooked it up to dad\u2019s truck. \n\nThis next part I\u2019m not sure of since I don\u2019t know much about towing but from what I was told, dad\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked. The truck, trailer, and skid loader was totaled. The insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck. There was none left over to cover BIL\u2019s stuff. When he got back to town, he exploded. He threaten to sue and things just went downhill from there. My parents are not rich and he wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything so in the end, sis talked him into letting it go. \n\nHowever, from that day on he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with our family. He doesn\u2019t come for birthdays, holidays, nothing at all. Next month is our parent\u2019s 50th anniversary and we\u2019re planning a big family gathering to celebrate. We\u2019re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico because they\u2019ve never been out of the country. I spoke to sis about it the other day and she said she\u2019s coming with the kids but BIL is not coming. I was fine with that but when we were discussing their portion of the cruise money, I heard him yelling in the background to deduct their portion from the cost of the skid loader and dump trailer. That pissed me if so after my call with sis, I called BIL and told him to get over himself. I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he\u2019ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he\u2019s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship. \n\nSis called me a few minutes ago and said they\u2019re not coming and that I was out of line. We argued for a bit and that\u2019s where it stands. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for telling him to let go of the past but they\u2019re not coming to the anniversary party so now I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAnswers to your questions:\n\nLet\u2019s get something straight. My dad and brother are not bad people. They are good people who made a mistake. They couldn\u2019t pay back BIL because he wanted almost $70,000 and again, we\u2019re not rich. Dad had to buy another truck because he needed it to go to work.\n\nOn the other hand, BIL had 3 other sets of skid loaders and dump trailers on his lot that day so he could take the financial hit while my parents would be homeless. BIL and sis are way better off then the rest of us so while I understand your reasoning of paying BIL back, he doesn\u2019t need it.\n\nThe cruise to Mexico isn\u2019t some millionaire trip. The total cost is about $3,000 and it\u2019ll take over 20 people to pay for that. Again, we\u2019re not rich. We can barely cover $3,000 spread out over 20 people so there\u2019s no way we can pay $70,000.", "created_utc": 1675249775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qqvsu/aita_for_telling_my_bil_to_get_over_himself_and/", "score": 9387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re calling him an ass for putting money in the way of a family relationship but isn\u2019t that exactly what your dad and brother were doing when they took his stuff knowing he said no rather than spend money to lease it from somewhere and then never even paid him back after wrecking it?

Stop making excuses and start apologizing.", "Omg. How do you not know that YTA?!?\n\nYour family went behind his back, borrowed a piece of HIS equipment, AND THEN THEY BROKE IT!!! And they had the audacity to be like \"ooh well. Sucks for you\". How the actual fuck do you expect him to trust any of you assholes again?

If the family was truly apologetic paying him back would be priority number one for reunification. Not suing, but also not dealing with people willing to completely violate boundaries is fair and I am shocked this didn't result in divorce/marriage issues. There is no way my spouse or I would override the other this way and let someone use something when \"No\" was already the answer. You don't get to decide time has passed so now it's fine, especially since no one has actually tried to make it right.", "YTA they stole (yes they stole them)  some very expensive equipment and wrecked it. They replaced their things with the insurance money but not the stolen items. He wants nothing to do with your family, why would he want to pay for their vacation.", "So your parents stole a very expensive piece of equipment, broke it, didn\u2019t pay him back, and now you\u2019re asking him for money to send these people on a cruise? Did I get that right?", "YTA. They didn\u2019t make a mistake. They stole his shit on purpose when he was gone and broke it. It\u2019s easy for the guilty party to \u2018forget the past\u2019, especially when they never did anything to make amends. What have they ever done to try and make it up to BIL in the 10 years since they stole and broke his stuff?", "YTA\n\nYou guys should chip in and pay for his losses.\n\nAlso, you are lucky he didn't press charges back then. That's more kindness than your lot deserves.", "YTA.\n\nYou asked for his skid loader. He said no due to the risks involved.\n\nYour family then took it without his permission and broke it. Your family then tried to manipulate and shame him into thinking that it's his fault apparently, as shown by your family loading the cost of the skid loader onto him.\n\nAnd now, you want him to celebrate on behalf of your family. Of course he said no, given that your family has treated him like a carpet to freeload responsibility to and step on. No shit sherlock.", "YTA. Your family stole BIL\u2019s skid loader and totaled it, and you never paid him back. I don\u2019t blame him for being upset.", " Yta, did they even apologise for doing it? They could have paid him back over time for the cost of the new skid loader - it would have directly impacted his business. He\u2019s not over it because your family hasn\u2019t tried to make any reparations", "YTA I\u2019m not even sure what a skid loader is but I\u2019m sure they are very expensive. Did your parents make any effort over the last ten years to pay this man for his property they basically stole and then destroyed ? I wouldn\u2019t pay for their cruise either and would have said the exact same thing. Deduct it from the money they owe him. Honestly your parents should be grateful he didn\u2019t sue them.", "YTA Why would he need to \"get over it\" when your dad and brother haven't paid him back? You are now asking him for further money? Ridiculous.", "YTA. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong\u201d - if the multiverse is real then I can guarantee there is not a single timeline where you, your brother or your dad are NTA in this situation.", "YTA. Your father and brother destroyed something that your BIL uses for work, never paid him back, and you\u2019re annoyed he doesn\u2019t want to send your parents on a cruise?", "YTA.  In ALL the intervening 10 years\u2026.has there been ANY attempt by your dad, brother (and the rest of you that are just blowing it all off) to pay anything back to him, and did they EVER say they were sorry?  It sounds like no on both counts.", "So let me get this straight: your dad and brother went behind your BIL's back and stole two very expensive pieces of equipment from him, wrecked them because of their own incompetence and haven't paid him back AT ALL for a replacement 10 years on because 'ooops, we don't have any money!'. Are you serious?\n\nYou have no right to tell your BIL that he has to 'get over' what your family did, especially since they still owe him for what they lost him. They proved with their irresponsible actions that he had a very good reason to not let them use his skid loader and they completely disrespected his wishes. I also wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't the only occasion where your family had stomped all over his boundaries and this was the last straw for him.\n\nQuite frankly, if you can afford to chip in to send your parents on a cruise then you can scrape something together to give to your BIL on their behalf. It must be absolutely galling for him to watch you help pay for an expensive gift when your family owe him what appears to be many thousands of dollars, ON TOP of expecting him to contribute to this gift, and I don't blame him at all for wanting little to do with you all as a result.\n\nYTA", "YTA and your dad and brother. They stole something that your BIL needs for his business and then ruined it and after 10 years haven't paid BIL back for it, and now the whole family is chipping in to send your parents on a cruise...this tells BIL that y'all have money...just not for his stuff.", "Yta. Your dad and bro are basically thieves. Not only did they steal from him, they stole something he needed to make his own income. If i were him I wouldn't be donating to holiday cause either. If he should be over it after 10 years, your dad and bro should have paid him back in 10 years", ">I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he\u2019ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he\u2019s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship. \n\nIf money is so unimportant and you don't want to have it get in the way of family relationships, why didn't you pay him back to keep the peace?\n\nYou aren't willing to, are you? Because money does matter. And you clearly value it more than family otherwise you and your father and your brother would have made things right along time ago. \n\nYTA", "Info: have your parents made any effort at all to at least start compensating your bil in the past 10 years?", "Yta, I bet it was really expensive. The bigger deal is that your family clearly doesn't respect him and his concerns or they wouldn't have gone behind his back.", "YTA.\n\nDid your family ever try to pay him back? Just because he's part of the family does'nt mean you get to wreck his property and not pay him back for it. The situation would'nt have come to this if you all chipped in and payed him back over the years if you're not financially able to pay it back all at once. The fact that you all did'nt recompensate even after 10 YEARS baffles me to no end", "I'd say you all owe him a big fat cheque. This isn't even your blood relative and you expect him to forgive you and your family who stole from him, destroyed the property, and have seemingly made no attempt to financially rectify things? How much does this wedding anniversary cost? I'd be pissed too.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Your BIL was financially affected by your family's abuse, and still he was nice enough not to sue your dad and brother... He should decide how long to hold the grudge, not you. \nAlso, he seems to have put the situation very clear. \"He'll let it go when they give him the $$$ he lost\" <== this leads me to believe that the issue was just left at that when the accident happened... I know medical bills were a thing at the moment, but now y'all planning a Mexico cruise, so there's some sort of $$$ in the bag, just none to pay BIL. \nLast, I think that this is an issue that does not involve you (BIL is upset with your dad and brother) \nI know you might feel a certain way about the situation your family is on, but this is an issue that started between them, it's is up to them to fix it.", "YTA, and your folks. Better start paying him back.", "You are very wrong.

Brother in law is correct to hold onto this", "YTA because your family literally stole from him and you have the gall to ask for money from him to send the thieves on a vacation. It can be 10 days ago or 10 years ago but it looks like they just expected your BIL to take it on the chin. Have they even made payment plans to repay him? No? Asshole family.", "YTA and the other are COMPLETE assholes, he already said no and they know that, and than talk to another to convince her to agree is definite Asshole move. Plus not paying for damages \n\nThey should be glad he didn't take them to court, or have them arrested.", "YTA. They stole from him and damaged his livelihood. He wasn't paid back.

Your post also doesn't say anything about them offering a genuine heartfelt apology. He's not putting money before *family*. Your BIL just isn't putting up with their extreme entitlement and disrespect.\n\nETA 2: I just looked up the average cost of a skid loader. They're $45k plus. Between the cost of buying a new one and any money that would have been made from work your BIL wasn't able to do until he got a new one, the amount of money your dad and brother cost him is disgustingly more than what you want him to contribute to the cruise.", "YTA obviously.

The lot of you have given him the PERFECT example of why he shouldn't trust your words or his property in your hands.\n\nHow much he cares about the money I, of course, can't say for sure, as that largely depends on him as a person and his financial situation.

About 10 years ago, my dad and brother was building a deck at my parent\u2019s home. They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no. They prepared the ground as best they could without the skid loader but got to the point they couldn\u2019t go on without it. They went to my sis\u2019s house to ask again but found out BIL went out of town. They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot and they hooked it up to dad\u2019s truck. \n\nThis next part I\u2019m not sure of since I don\u2019t know much about towing but from what I was told, dad\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked. The truck, trailer, and skid loader was totaled. The insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck. There was none left over to cover BIL\u2019s stuff. When he got back to town, he exploded. He threaten to sue and things just went downhill from there. My parents are not rich and he wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything so in the end, sis talked him into letting it go. \n\nHowever, from that day on he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with our family. He doesn\u2019t come for birthdays, holidays, nothing at all. Next month is our parent\u2019s 50th anniversary and we\u2019re planning a big family gathering to celebrate. We\u2019re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico because they\u2019ve never been out of the country. I spoke to sis about it the other day and she said she\u2019s coming with the kids but BIL is not coming. I was fine with that but when we were discussing their portion of the cruise money, I heard him yelling in the background to deduct their portion from the cost of the skid loader and dump trailer. That pissed me if so after my call with sis, I called BIL and told him to get over himself. I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he\u2019ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he\u2019s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship. \n\nSis called me a few minutes ago and said they\u2019re not coming and that I was out of line. We argued for a bit and that\u2019s where it stands. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for telling him to let go of the past but they\u2019re not coming to the anniversary party so now I\u2019m not sure.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They put money (the cost of paying someone to do the work) ahead of family (your BIL's wishes to not loan out his very expensive equipment that his business relies on to feed his family).   They went behind your BIL's back and took his equipment without his permission while he was out of town.  \n\n2)  BIL didn't sue your family.  He would have gotten something - the insurance money that was used to replace the truck.   Your sister talked your BIL out of suing, and your family is ungrateful.\n\n3)  Your family believes that your BIL shouldn't be paid back for his very expensive financial loss, as they never set up a payment plan or offered any money.  \n\n4)  Your family pressures your sister, which causes her distress in her own family, as evidently you think it is okay to get in the middle of this problem.  \n\n5)  What would you do if your spouse's family called and yelled at your spouse?   Why should BIL \"forget\" that your family totally lied and screwed him over?  Would you be able to forgive your spouse's family if they had treated you this badly - lying, manipulating, and then yelling at you years later for not pretending that it never happened?  BIL knows how your family is - why should he forget and pretend otherwise.  There is a saying - when people show you who they are the first time, believe them.   For all you know, this financial loss costs your BIL many opportunities that continue into the present.  It is hard to \"forget\" something that expensive if you have to make payments on a new skid loader and trailer for the next 5 or more years.", "The people they post in here, blow me away.

Dear old dad should be making every effort to pay off that skid loader before buying new cars, fixing up their kitchen, going on a freaking cruise, or even getting McDonalds, but I guess they don't care. \n\nThis is outlandish.", "That was my thought.\n\nThere are very very few situations where a skid loader would be necessary for building a deck, and in those cases, DIY is probably a really bad idea.", "Well thats not free", "No kidding. I never park in a garage, so when I borrowed a car I turned coming out and broke the side mirror. It was a simple accident caused by my own inexperience, and I\u2019m told a lot of people make it when they start using a garage, but I immediately told the owner I would pay all the costs of replacement. (Which in this case was the entire side mirror assembly on a new car, not just the glass.) Because I broke it, no matter the reason. \n\nI continued borrowing the car for weeks and always made sure to never ever make that mistake again. And they trusted me with their car because they knew I did take responsibility. It\u2019s a really simple concept, honestly.", "Oh for sure. I can imagine the guilt the wife must have felt must've been soul destroying after BiL has presumably worked very hard to get to where he is and own the equipment he has. \n\nA momentary lapse from undoubted guilt tripping from ops parents could've ruined absolutely everything for them. \n\nGlad they survived through it all. And op, you and your family bar the sister are the arsehole of arseholes.", "> dad\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked\n\nYou slightly wonder if the only lesson they took from the crash is that the dad needs a *bigger* truck for towing stuff", "I don\u2019t find it difficult to believe that he didn\u2019t mention it. It may not have come to mind that he needs to tell her everything that happens relating to him and his in-laws. So if he hadn\u2019t mentioned what could\u2019ve been just a blimp on the radar to him, she may not have known that he already said no.", "\\*Ma'am, but thanks. ;)", "Exactly!", "I got in an actual argument with my Mom and brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 over this. Her mom had tanked her credit and stolen like $6000 in taking cash advances and shit on credit cards under her daughters name. I explained that all she had to do was file a police report and she could get the ball rolling on clearing her credit and not paying the debt. Instead I got lectured on how \u201cthat\u2019s her mom\u201d and \u201cfamily is family\u201d no matter what. Some people are insanely brainwashed when their family clearly doesn\u2019t care about them", "She really shouldn't have lent it out without asking her husband first. Especially knowing he already said no. The fact they have to wear her down to borrow it suggests she knew it was a bad idea at the very least and gave in anyhow. I don't know, that'd be a deal breaker for me.", "Definitely the sense I got as well. I come from a family like this that operates like this and disrespects eachother\u2018a boundaries while covering for eachother and acting like there\u2019s nothing wrong. My spouse is like you and has taught me to stop tolerating their bullshit. I no longer talk to half of my family because they couldn\u2019t get with the program and I\u2019m infinitely happier now. Some families really do have a culty vibe and it sux.", "Because that would have cost them money to rent equipments instead of bullying family members into letting them use their own equipment (for free of course) even if they are their workplace equipments and not their own.", "I feel like we dont know enough about what happened when bro and dad showed up. She may have just gone along with what they wanted but it sounds more like they browbeat her into it or they just steamrolled over her objections and just did it anyway.", "Chingona! I have a girl friend in construction and it is hard.", "This probably screwed over some of the subcontractors he had too.", "ThEy ArEnT RiCh!!!", "It\u2019s 100% negligence. You need an endorsement for a trailer that size and anyone who can do it competently would know the size of truck needed.", "I don\u2019t ascribe to family helps family. I don\u2019t because we get taken advantage of etc.", "It was the \u201cthey talked my sister into it\u201d that made me feel like maybe it was more guilt than anything.", "I\u2019m just shocked they were able to remain married for another decade with this dynamic. I hope OP\u2019s sister stays strong!", "Maybe the money lost was his price for opening his wife\u2019s eyes. And", "I had to look up what a skid loader is. What kind of idiots think they can move something like that without the right equipment? It\u2019s like a bad sitcom scenario.", "Right.. The stolen equipment should have been paid for first", "Exactly. They had enough money to replace the perpetrator's truck and they have enough to send the perpetrator on a cruise, and yet they cannot seem to find any money to even start to pay for the equipment that they stole and destroyed. These people have *no* integrity! BIL is wise not to trust them.", "Nah, insurance wouldn't have covered the skid steer at all. And alot of times you have to replace the thing insurance is paying you to replace. It can be fraud to not.", "This is it right here, as a professional contractor with jobs on his docket they most likely demanded he help them for free or loan them equipment they weren't licensed or insured to use because *family*. He refused. Just because your daughter marries a professional something or other doesn't mean they can't charge you for their work. Just because some contractors will do some free work for their inlaws doesn't mean it's required. These people are disgustingly entitled. YTA OP.", "> why didnt they chip in and buy him a new skid loader and trailer\n\nIt was an ACCIDENT! Why should they pay for an ACCIDENT? /s\n\nI used to have friends like that. Nothing was ever their fault, and if it was, the fact that they didn't INTEND to cause damage absolves them of everything. Can't imagine being married into a family of those types. BIL is incredibly generous for not having involved the law.", "Sure, but it isn't fraud to sell the truck afterwards to recuperate some of the money.", "Professional contractor who likely lost work because he didn't have a skid loader. Everyone forgets about that.", "Pay close attention, Princess: YTA.  YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE.  Sued?  Your dad and brother should have gotten arrested for grand theft.  They didn't just \"borrow\" and ruin a set of golf clubs.  They destroyed a very expensive piece of machinery that affected how your BIL does business and pays for his life.  And everybody else's reaction is, \"Oh well\"?", "Yeah I'm sorry but you damaged his livelyhood  and probably caused his insurance to skyrocket. \nHonestly I'm shocked he's still a brother in law", "YTA. I don't see what 10 years has to do with it. Imagine if your family had stolen the equipment from a contractor they aren't related to. Father and brother would have gone to jail and would have been sued for cost of equipment and legal fees. They should have profusely thank BIL for keeping them out of jail, apologized and made arragements to pay him back. Instead, your family is blaming the victim and thinks that the victim is \"holding a grudge\". No, the victim is naturally pissed off at your family for stealing from him and not acknowleging it was theft much less reimbursing him. Any normal person would still be pissed off no matter how much time has passed. Why do you think you're in charge of what your BIL should or shouldn't feel? I'm amazed he has any dealings with your family at all.\n\nI suspect you don't actually give a shit about BIL and are thrilled that he never comes to family gatherings because he's a constant reminder of your family's crime. But now that you want money from him, he needs to get over the crime. I don't know how you, your father or your brother sleep at night.", "OP and his family are among the worst kind of people in this world", "Exactly.  OP literally couldn't care less than BIL wasn't joining them on the vacation.  The concern only kicked in once OP found out that he wasn't giving them money.", "It sounds to me like they browbeat the sister into allowing them into the yard.  I'd say that she was devastated by what happened, but her family seem to only worried about what would happen to them, not to sister or BIL.", "Yeah if he reported it stolen his own insurance would have likely kicked in.", "The courts in the US allow payment plans as well. I don\u2019t know about the insurance stuff since I have never tried to pull anything my vehicle couldn\u2019t handle.", "At $500 a month, he would almost be paid off now.\n\nWhat a shitty family. YTA and so are your parents.\n\nHow about they give him mortgage on the house for the $50,000. And how about shitty OP starts contributing to paying him back.", "And the fact that they\u2019re all pooling together money now to give to the parents, and they actually expect one single cent to come from the brother-in-law\u2019s combined household income is so twisted. These people are straight up delusional. That is a level of entitlement that is literally a delusion", "Pretty easy to see why BIL said no to them in the first place.", "You can see it runs in the family\n\nI don\u2019t blame the BIL for having nothing to do with them, actually surprised he hasn\u2019t divorced the sister as she was an accomplice to this shitshow", "> whether the sister is technically an owner or employee of the business.\n\nAnd even if she's neither, if they badgered BIL into not reporting it, or he didn't report it because he didn't want his wife roped into a criminal charge for being badgered into it by her dad and brother, there's effectively no crime.", "Also,  the kind of idiots that think they can just hop on a machine like that and use it with no training or supervision.", "I do believe it's the same in the US & if so, I'd say SUE\n\n\nQuestion was asked & answered by BIL and they didn't like it. Instead of finding a place to rent equipment they harassed their family member into participating in the theft.", "I am not an insurancer, but I have heard a few cases in the usa where insurance won't cover such and such because with out pressing charges it works out to negligence on the part of the owner, where as if charger were pressed then obviously the owner isn't negligent.", "Yes that\u2019s the cherry on top of it all. \n\nThey destroyed his expensive equipment. \nThey never pay him back. \nHe essentially goes NC with them. \nAND they are asking him and his wife for holiday money. \n\nThe audacity. \n\nJust get over it, yeah right.", "> Instead they went like \"oh insurance didn't pay enough for everything, tough luck I guess, let's just shrug our shoulders and ignore the hell out of this\"\n\nWorse than that, \"insurance only paid enough for *our* stuff\" is them prioritising themselves.  It would have been perfectly reasonable to say that the insurance only paid enough for medical and the bobcat, and it's just tough luck that it wasn't enough to cover *their* truck.", "And building a deck is a completely unimportant home repair. If you don\u2019t have the money don\u2019t do it.", "oh is that an option? then yes that would've been much better. would that have been covered by insurance then?", "Damn, I would NOT want to be in a situation where the decision whether to charge my wife with a crime is a *financial calculus.*\n\nI mean, surely that\u2019s what it came down to\u2014100K vs [the price of a lawyer plus possible fines plus any effect on *her* earning potential a conviction would have]. What a horrible marital conversation to have. I\u2019d cut ties with in-laws just for making me go through THAT experience, never mind the extra terribleness of the lack of remorse, refusal to compensate, talk of raising money to send them abroad, etc.", "The self entitlement of this family and especially the BIL is appalling and the BIL is still justifying this ten years later.\n\nAll of this information about *why* they needed said equipment. How the BIL said no but they drove over to \u201csis\u2019s\u201d house to ask the BIL to borrow it? Why not call again and ask for help? Because they *knew* he was out of town.  More information on how they talked sis into stealing her husband equipment and then \u201cI don\u2019t know much about towing but\u2026\u201d and glosses over the rest. \n\nHow in the hell did they think they had the right to \u201cborrow\u201d heavy machinery when the brother-in-law told them no?! For a back yard deck? They were trying to save a buck and in doing so put a dent into their BIL/SIL and husbands and therefore \u201csis\u201d livelihood. \n\nIt is the upmost betrayal and it doesn\u2019t matter if they are family. It is obvious they have no remorse all the way to the point of saying if they sued my parents he wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything so nice try BIL. \n\nNOW the OP has the audacity to ask for \u201ctheir portion\u201d of a cruise?! Ironically defending his point by saying \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t let money get in the way of family\u201d. Yet why is the OP calling and berating the BIL?

He knows they have no idea or business using this machine.", "I think that also needs a certification to operate.\n\nIt has been 10 years and they haven't paid it, that is the most intriguing thing there. That expensive is not something you just forget about.", "YTA. And so is your family. \n\n1. They robbed him. \n2. Destroyed his expensive equipment. \n3. Didn\u2019t even get a slap on the wrist. \n4. After 10 years never paid him back. \n5. We are talking about several thousands of dollars stolen from his construction company. \n6. He more than likely lost even more money from losing contracts over NOT HAVING HIS EQUIPMENT. \n\nI hope your sister goes NC with all of y\u2019all over this and I hope they don\u2019t give y\u2019all any money for that vacation.", "Apologies mean nothing after 10 years.\n\nUnless OP\u2019s family pony up with a check to cover BIL\u2019s losses, he should tell them to pound sand.", "OP's family is lucky the BIL didn't sue the fuck out of them.

She was probably actually remorseful and realized she'd been manipulated. \n\nAlthough if she gives them money for that vacation, BIL should rethink his marriage because if she does, she's clearly learned nothing.\n\nThe absolute audacity to ask them to contribute!", "I\u2019ll agree there. Both of us had difficulty setting boundaries with our families. We\u2019re a lot better these days.", "My question as well. Sometimes when one member of a poorer family is doing fairly well, favors and help can become expectated. This is not by any means super common but it does happen. I've experienced a bit of this. It builds major resentment. A loss like this in a single event is a breaking point.\n\nMy guess is BIL had had enough with their expectations by that point.

Um- NO!!!!  That is not ok!
