About 10 years ago, my dad and brother was building a deck at my parent\u2019s home. They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no. They prepared the ground as best they could without the skid loader but got to the point they couldn\u2019t go on without it. They went to my sis\u2019s house to ask again but found out BIL went out of town. They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot and they hooked it up to dad\u2019s truck. \n\nThis next part I\u2019m not sure of since I don\u2019t know much about towing but from what I was told, dad\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked. The truck, trailer, and skid loader was totaled. The insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck. There was none left over to cover BIL\u2019s stuff. When he got back to town, he exploded. He threaten to sue and things just went downhill from there. My parents are not rich and he wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything so in the end, sis talked him into letting it go. \n\nHowever, from that day on he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with our family. He doesn\u2019t come for birthdays, holidays, nothing at all. Next month is our parent\u2019s 50th anniversary and we\u2019re planning a big family gathering to celebrate. We\u2019re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico because they\u2019ve never been out of the country. I spoke to sis about it the other day and she said she\u2019s coming with the kids but BIL is not coming. I was fine with that but when we were discussing their portion of the cruise money, I heard him yelling in the background to deduct their portion from the cost of the skid loader and dump trailer. That pissed me if so after my call with sis, I called BIL and told him to get over himself. I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he\u2019ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he\u2019s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship. \n\nSis called me a few minutes ago and said they\u2019re not coming and that I was out of line. We argued for a bit and that\u2019s where it stands. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for telling him to let go of the past but they\u2019re not coming to the anniversary party so now I\u2019m not sure.", "created_utc": 1675249775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qqvsu/aita_for_telling_my_bil_to_get_over_himself_and/", "score": 413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your family sound massively entitled, your BIL is smart to cut the lot of you clean off.", "YTA. They stole and destroyed his stuff and refused to pay. Not even offering instalments over time. It\u2019s easy to say get over it to the one who was wronged. You\u2019re saying it was 10 years ago so he should be over it by now but from his perspective that\u2019s 10 years they\u2019ve had to make it right and not tried. You\u2019re calling him an ass for putting money in the way of a family relationship but isn\u2019t that exactly what your dad and brother were doing when they took his stuff knowing he said no rather than spend money to lease it from somewhere and then never even paid him back after wrecking it? And you expect him to spend more sending your parents on a cruise? You are being unreasonable and unrealistic and didn\u2019t even have to insert your opinion in the first place, it\u2019s only made things worse.", "YTA, your dad and brother stole a skid loader ( I will be honest here, I had to look up the price, the cheapest I found was 30k, no small funds )  and hurt him financially.  You have absolutely no right to tell someone how to forgive this.  He can hold a grudge if he wants to.", "\u201cThe insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck\u201d\n\n\nUmmm why was the truck the first priority and not the thing they STOLE???

And your dad. And your brother. So y'all have the funds to pay for an expensive cruise, but a decade later can't pay him back\n\n Your family fucked with his livelihood and clearly don't give a flying fuck how it has impacted him, so why should he want to be around you?", "YTA. Your BIL got a shitty deal and lost a lot of money because your sister and your dad were irresponsible, he received no recompense, AND he is being treated like the bad guy? Sounds like a justified thing to be upset about to me.", "YTA...did anyone ever chip in and pay anything back to BIL? He was kind enough to let your parents avoid a terrible legal situation. Stop making excuses and start apologizing.", "Omg. How do you not know that YTA?!?\n\nYour family went behind his back, borrowed a piece of HIS equipment, AND THEN THEY BROKE IT!!! And they had the audacity to be like \"ooh well. Sucks for you\". How the actual fuck do you expect him to trust any of you assholes again? OF COURSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE AROUND PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY STOLE FROM HIM AND THEN DESTROYED THE THING THEY BORROWED AND RECUPERATED THEIR OWN LOSSES BUT NEVER MADE THIS RIGHT?\n\nGTFOH WITH THAT! \n\nYTA YTA. YOUR BROTHER IS THE ASSHOLE. YOUR DAD IS THE ASSHOLE. \n\nYour brother and dad made themselves whole financially. They left him down by about $30,000 on the low end. And you had the audacity to talk like that? You damn right I wouldn't pitch in to send them any fucking where.", "Based on your post, your father never repaid him.  which make you double YTA\n\nYTA, listen to yourself.  \"my brother and father stole from BIL and destroyed his property, but he needs to get over it\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFather and brother should have been arrested.", "What\u2019s missing from your story is where your father & brother took accountability for their truly asshole behavior that caused very real damages for another person & worked sincerely to make up for it. \n\nIf the insurance didn\u2019t cover everyone\u2019s damages then after necessary medical costs the skid loader should have been fixed because your BIL was the innocent party. Instead your dad put that money towards his own truck. Your BIL was extremely kind not to sue. \n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years, so how much of the damages have your father & brother paid back? If the answer isn\u2019t all of it then not only are they complete & utter grade A assholes but so are you. \n\nYTA in this latest chapter of the story for blaming the victim for not just rolling over & accepting his awful in-laws actual criminal behavior. \n\nGood for your sister for standing by the right person in this chapter.", "YTA. Guy was stolen from and had his lively hood put at risk by his family after telling them no.", "YTA BIL is right. If the family was truly apologetic paying him back would be priority number one for reunification. Not suing, but also not dealing with people willing to completely violate boundaries is fair and I am shocked this didn't result in divorce/marriage issues. There is no way my spouse or I would override the other this way and let someone use something when \"No\" was already the answer. You don't get to decide time has passed so now it's fine, especially since no one has actually tried to make it right.", "YTA they stole (yes they stole them)  so very expensive equipment and wrecked it. They replaced their things with the insurance money but not the stolen items. He wants nothing to do with your family, why would he want to pay for their vacation.", "So your parents stole a very expensive piece of equipment, broke it, didn\u2019t pay him back, and now you\u2019re asking him for money to send these people on a cruise? Did I get that right?", "YTA. They didn\u2019t make a mistake. They stole his shit on purpose when he was gone and broke it. It\u2019s easy for the guilty party to \u2018forget the past\u2019, especially when they never did anything to make amends. What have they ever done to try and make it up to BIL in the 10 years since they stole and broke his stuff?", "YTA\n\nYou guys should chip in and pay for his losses.\n\nAlso, you are lucky he didn't press charges back then. That's more kindness than your lot deserves.", "YTA.\n\nYou asked for his skid loader. He said no due to the risks involved.\n\nYour family then took it without his permission and broke it. Your family then tried to manipulate and shame him into thinking that it's his fault apparently, as shown by your family loading the cost of the skid loader onto him.\n\nAnd now, you want him to celebrate on behalf of your family. Of course he said no, given that your family has treated him like a carpet to freeload responsibility to and step on. No shit sherlock.", "YTA. Your family stole BIL\u2019s skid loader and totaled it, and you never paid him back. I don\u2019t blame him for being upset.", " Yta, did they even apologise for doing it? They could have paid him back over time for the cost of the new skid loader - it would have directly impacted his business. He\u2019s not over it because your family hasn\u2019t tried to make any reparations", "YTA I\u2019m not even sure what a skid loader is but I\u2019m sure they are very expensive. Did your parents make any effort over the last ten years to pay this man for his property they basically stole and then destroyed ? I wouldn\u2019t pay for their cruise either and would have said the exact same thing. Deduct it from the money they owe him. Honestly your parents should be grateful he didn\u2019t sue them.", "YTA Why would he need to \"get over it\" when your dad and brother haven't paid him back? You are now asking him for further money? Ridiculous.", "YTA. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong\u201d - if the multiverse is real then I can guarantee there is not a single timeline where you, your brother or your dad are NTA in this situation.", "YTA. Your father and brother destroyed something that your BIL uses for work, never paid him back, and you\u2019re annoyed he doesn\u2019t want to send your parents on a cruise?", "YTA.  In ALL the intervening 10 years\u2026.has there been ANY attempt by your dad, brother (and the rest of you that are just blowing it all off) to pay anything back to him, and did they EVER say they were sorry?  It sounds like no on both counts.", "So let me get this straight: your dad and brother went behind your BIL's back and stole two very expensive pieces of equipment from him, wrecked them because of their own incompetence and haven't paid him back AT ALL for a replacement 10 years on because 'ooops, we don't have any money!'. Are you serious?\n\nYou have no right to tell your BIL that he has to 'get over' what your family did, especially since they still owe him for what they lost him. They proved with their irresponsible actions that he had a very good reason to not let them use his skid loader and they completely disrespected his wishes. I also wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't the only occasion where your family had stomped all over his boundaries and this was the last straw for him.\n\nQuite frankly, if you can afford to chip in to send your parents on a cruise then you can scrape something together to give to your BIL on their behalf. It must be absolutely galling for him to watch you help pay for an expensive gift when your family owe him what appears to be many thousands of dollars, ON TOP of expecting him to contribute to this gift, and I don't blame him at all for wanting little to do with you all as a result.\n\nYTA", "YTA and your dad and brother. They stole something that your BIL needs for his business and then ruined it and after 10 years haven't paid BIL back for it, and now the whole family is chipping in to send your parents on a cruise...this tells BIL that y'all have money...just not for his stuff.", "Yta. Your dad and bro are basically thieves. Not only did they steal from him, they stole something he needed to make his own income. If i were him I wouldn't be donating to holiday cause either. If he should be over it after 10 years, your dad and bro should have paid him back in 10 years", ">I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he\u2019ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he\u2019s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship. \n\nIf money is so unimportant and you don't want to have it get in the way of family relationships, why didn't you pay him back to keep the peace?\n\nYou aren't willing to, are you? Because money does matter. And you clearly value it more than family otherwise you and your father and your brother would have made things right along time ago. \n\nYTA", "Info: have your parents made any effort at all to at least start compensating your bil in the past 10 years?", "Yta, I bet it was really expensive. The bigger deal is that your family clearly doesn't respect him and his concerns or they wouldn't have gone behind his back.", "YTA.\n\nDid your family ever try to pay him back? Just because he's part of the family does'nt mean you get to wreck his property and not pay him back for it. The situation would'nt have come to this if you all chipped in and payed him back over the years if you're not financially able to pay it back all at once. The fact that you all did'nt recompensate even after 10 YEARS baffles me to no end", "I'd say you all owe him a big fat cheque. This isn't even your blood relative and you expect him to forgive you and your family who stole from him, destroyed the property, and have seemingly made no attempt to financially rectify things? How much does this wedding anniversary cost? I'd be pissed too.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Your BIL was financially affected by your family's abuse, and still he was nice enough not to sue your dad and brother... He should decide how long to hold the grudge, not you. \nAlso, he seems to have put the situation very clear. \"He'll let it go when they give him the $$$ he lost\" <== this leads me to believe that the issue was just left at that when the accident happened... I know medical bills were a thing at the moment, but now y'all planning a Mexico cruise, so there's some sort of $$$ in the bag, just none to pay BIL. \nLast, I think that this is an issue that does not involve you (BIL is upset with your dad and brother) \nI know you might feel a certain way about the situation your family is on, but this is an issue that started between them, it's is up to them to fix it.", "YTA, and your folks. Better start paying him back.", "You are very wrong. Very very.\n\nHe lost a lot of money (Edit: because of ALL OF YOU) and all of you's reaction is \"No big deal, get over it.\"\n\nIf you sister goes no contact I wouldn't be surprised. YTA", "YTA.

I'm sorry, but this is one where I have to say, YTA and so are your sister, dad and brother.", "Excuse me? The steal and totaled her work machinery and never paid him back anything not even after 10 years, get out of here you brat, they are lucky he didn't sue them and more, he's totally right and YTA.", "Yta they stole and destroyed something he used for his work that he had denied them permission to use. He should have pressed charges and they should have paid back every penny", "YTA.  Brother in law is correct to hold onto this", "YTA because your family literally stole from him and you have the gall to ask for money from him to send the thieves on a vacation. It can be 10 days ago or 10 years ago but it looks like they just expected your BIL to take it on the chin. Have they even made payment plans to repay him? No? Asshole family.", "YTA and the other are COMPLETE assholes, he already said no and they know that, and than talk to another to convince her to agree is definite Asshole move. Plus not paying for damages \n\nThey should be glad he didn't take them to court, or have them arrested.", "YTA. They stole from him and damaged his livelihood. He wasn't paid back. Now you want more money from him. He working to provide for your sister and her kids. Pay him back before you pay for a cruise.", "YTA and so are your parents and y'all should use that cruise money to finally pay back BIL.", "Good god YTA.\n\nYou basically stole specialized equipment you were told not to use and totaled it, put your BIL\u2019s business in danger and never gave him anything back for his trouble, never apologized and then ten years later, you have the AUDACITY to come and ask for more money to your BIL for your parents\u2019 cruise?! And by the looks of it, you never did anything to try and pay back at least a portion of the equipment you broke.\n\nI have no idea what makes you think you\u2019re not an AH for that.", "YTA\n\nYour dad and brother took BIL's property, caused it to be destroyed, have never paid him back, and now you want him to give money towards your dad's cruise. Explain to me why he should just be over it.\n\nETA: They've had 10 years, a whole damn decade, to pay him back and they haven't done so. Not even in installments. Your post also doesn't say anything about them offering a genuine heartfelt apology. He's not putting money before *family*. Your BIL just isn't putting up with their extreme entitlement and disrespect.\n\nETA 2: I just looked up the average cost of a skid loader. They're $45k plus. Between the cost of buying a new one and any money that would have been made from work your BIL wasn't able to do until he got a new one, the amount of money your dad and brother cost him is disgustingly more than what you want him to contribute to the cruise.", "YTA obviously. He lost A LOT of money simply because your family couldn't take no for an answer. And now they want to go on a vacation when he's still out that money", ">we\u2019re planning a big family gathering to celebrate.  \n>  \n>We\u2019re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico\n\nSo if there is money around why hasn't it gone to the BIL to compensate him for your father stealing and destroying the BIL's business's property?\n\nYTA and your attitude is going to make it even harder for everyone to \"move on\" from this!", "YTA It's likely it isn't about the money - your dad and brother went behind your BIL's back to talk his partner into letting them borrow BIL's (probably very expensive) construction equipment, STOLE IT FROM THE SITE IT WAS AT, and destroyed it... because BIL said no.\n\nOf course he wants nothing to do with any of you. The lot of you have given him the PERFECT example of why he shouldn't trust your words or his property in your hands.\n\nHow much he cares about the money I, of course, can't say for sure, as that largely depends on him as a person and his financial situation. What I CAN say ,however, is that the money is the easy thing to focus on. It's a material issue and, therefore, theoretically the easiest to fix: Replace what is lost to the best of one's ability. \n\nYou can't replace lost trust. The longer all of you go without remedying stealing and destroying BIL's stuff - which, by the way, it's a WONDER he didn't sue you for theft and destruction of property, or that your brother and dad didn't face any legal consequences - the more trust BIL loses in all of you.", "YTA a major one, your brother and dad are AHs, and your sister is an AH.\n\n>They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no\n\nBIL said no, key word: NO\n\n>They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot amd they hooked it up to dad's truck\n\nAt this point it's theft considering BIL said no and your sister had no right to allow them to take and  use it in the first place\n\n>Dad's truck wasn\u2019t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on thr dump trailer do he lost cintrol and wrecked.

Well that ended with me taking the guy to court because he didn\u2019t fix my car!!! \n\nGuess which one of those two posted in a community Facebook group about their car being totaled by a drunk driver a couple years after and I had to fight the urge from commenting \u201cKARMAS A BITCH!!\u201d on the post?!\n\nIt\u2019s not about the mistake you make, it\u2019s how you handle it in the aftermath.

About 10 years ago, my dad and brother was building a deck at my parent\u2019s home. They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no. They prepared the ground as best they could without the skid loader but got to the point they couldn\u2019t go on without it. They went to my sis\u2019s house to ask again but found out BIL went out of town. They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot and they hooked it up to dad\u2019s truck. \n\nThis next part I\u2019m not sure of since I don\u2019t know much about towing but from what I was told, dad\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked. The truck, trailer, and skid loader was totaled. The insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck. There was none left over to cover BIL\u2019s stuff. When he got back to town, he exploded. He threaten to sue and things just went downhill from there. My parents are not rich and he wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything so in the end, sis talked him into letting it go. \n\nHowever, from that day on he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with our family. He doesn\u2019t come for birthdays, holidays, nothing at all. Next month is our parent\u2019s 50th anniversary and we\u2019re planning a big family gathering to celebrate. We\u2019re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico because they\u2019ve never been out of the country. I spoke to sis about it the other day and she said she\u2019s coming with the kids but BIL is not coming. I was fine with that but when we were discussing their portion of the cruise money, I heard him yelling in the background to deduct their portion from the cost of the skid loader and dump trailer. That pissed me if so after my call with sis, I called BIL and told him to get over himself. I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he\u2019ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he\u2019s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship. \n\nSis called me a few minutes ago and said they\u2019re not coming and that I was out of line. We argued for a bit and that\u2019s where it stands. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for telling him to let go of the past but they\u2019re not coming to the anniversary party so now I\u2019m not sure.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
