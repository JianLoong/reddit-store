I don't care how wonderful this guy is. He is waving some huge RED FLAGS by continuing to give money to his mother with drug and alcohol addiction, who refuses to get help and who won't hold down a job. Further red flags are that he wants to move her onto a property next to two of you and \"provide her at-home care.\" His mother has serious addiction issues and your BF, who likely grew up with her addiction issues, has not dealt with the trauma of having an addict parent in a way that has allowed him to put down firm boundaries and be ready to start a clean life with a new partner. Instead, he's willing to keep enabling her addiction and addictive behaviors, and that means that anyone in HIS life will only get dragged down with his mother's addiction (that would be you.)\n\nThe good thing right now is that you do not have children with this man. You do not own property with this man. You have dated him for a year and a half and I know it sucks to think about ending a relationship with someone you care about, but you need to face facts. If you stay with him, he will continue giving her money, even if that is money you and your kids need. This woman will continue to be a destructive presence in your life. Do you really see her becoming homeless and him saying you won't offer up a spare bedroom? Ask yourself if you want her drug and alcohol addiction next door to your future sleeping 2 year old. That's your answer.

He needs to go to Al-Anon or AA, or see a therapist, to deal with this.\n\nHis mother will constantly take $ from him.

If you're 26, his mother is probably in her 40s or 50s and can conceivably have another 30-40 years to go. \n\nI personally could not do it. The fact that he picks up weed for her and cannot even say no to that would indicate to me that he has no boundaries. \n\n*\"Will you pick up my weed for me?\"* \n\nShould be something EASY to say no to for him.

If he is not open to it and ignores the obvious signs that his mom is in crisis then there are other concerns about your relationship.\n\nTalk to him about options and your concerns regarding not only the present but the future and how his mom's behavior would have a negative impact on not just you, but your future family. \n\nIf you don't make any headway with your BF then you may need to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nI hope you can figure this out and get help for his mom.", "NTA, he feels responsible because of alcoholic codependency that frequently comes with being a child of a drunk.

It would be best to prioritize taking care of yourself and your close ones (spouse, kids). If it doesn't interfere with the first, taking care of the parents is good. But it's okay to refuse taking care of them, especially if they're not your parents. Even if his mom behaved more responsibly, you can still choose not to live close to her.

As it ought to be. Your BF needs to establish boundaries with his mom or this is going to be happening forever.", "Well no, NTA.  It sounds like an incompatibility issue that's a hard stop for you both.  It stinks, but living with an in-law is a pain in the ass...for both of you.  Then throw in kids?  My daughter still feels like mamaw treats her differently then my son because we all lived together for a couple years.\n\nBut on the other hand, ya can't really expect him to say that he should tell his mother to be homeless (if that's your situation) nor could you expect him to be okay with it.

This will never change. Get out now while you can, no matter what promises he makes to you on her behalf.", "NTA.  This is something you NEED to talk about, rather than stay together and someday have your boyfriend/husband spring this on you.  Your boyfriend has a complicated, enmeshed relationship with his mother and this is something you need to consider going forward because unless he sees the problem and wants to change it, it's not going to change and she's going to be an ongoing factor in your life as long as you're with him.\n\nJust a nickel's worth of free advice here... my husband and I have been married for 25 years.  He has issues with him family and always had.  Back when we got married, I felt like these were his issues to deal with with his family and I could just stay out of it.  Yeah... no.  His family is still dysfunctional, his way of dealing with them is still dysfunctional because learning relationship skills is hard and you have to want to put the work in to do it, and dealing with his family has been the number one cause of friction in our marriage.  It has definitely affected me and the kids as much (or more) than it affected us.  If you stay with this guy, his mom will be a part of your life and the life of future kids, and if he's not committed to making the relationship more functional, it's going to be a problem.  Just go into that with your eyes open because if it's a deal-breaker, it's better you know a year in than in ten years when you have a mortgage and a couple kids with this guy.\n\nI'm not saying I wouldn't have married my husband, but I would have made us get some counseling where we discussed how we were going to handle the relationship with his family going forward and where he could figure out how to stop feeding into the dysfunction by actually setting some limits with them, because it's not something he's been good at doing and it has caused us all (kids included) a lot of issues over the years.", "NTA at all, although I\u2019m gonna say from her lifestyle it sounds like she might not even make it long enough for it to be an issue", "NTA. He needs to go to Alanon to learn how to handle this.", "NTA.\n\nDon't accept him saying he will listen to you, if he doesn't agree. It will come up again later at some point, and if that's when you have kids and he figures you won't leave if he let's her stay, you can suddenly find yourself living with her anyways. Or because she has gotten herself into an even worse situation and he feels responsible for helping her regardless if you leave or not.\n\nThis problem will not disappear. She will likely not get her life together. If he doesn't want to set boundaries and hold her responsible for taking care of herself, and is *voluntarily* setting up a living situation for her at your place.... I can tell you, he is not going to easily change the way he thinks. If he doesn't change the way he thinks, this is going to end you one way or another; you're going to leave him because she does move on, or he resents you for not letting his mother move in.\n\nYou need a long term solution for this problem, not just a right now solution.", "NTA and this is absolutely the hill to die on, I\u2019d get in freaking writing before marriage.
