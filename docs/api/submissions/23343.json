I don't care how wonderful this guy is. He is waving some huge RED FLAGS by continuing to give money to his mother with drug and alcohol addiction, who refuses to get help and who won't hold down a job. Further red flags are that he wants to move her onto a property next to two of you and \"provide her at-home care.\" His mother has serious addiction issues and your BF, who likely grew up with her addiction issues, has not dealt with the trauma of having an addict parent in a way that has allowed him to put down firm boundaries and be ready to start a clean life with a new partner. Instead, he's willing to keep enabling her addiction and addictive behaviors, and that means that anyone in HIS life will only get dragged down with his mother's addiction (that would be you.)\n\nThe good thing right now is that you do not have children with this man. You do not own property with this man. You have dated him for a year and a half and I know it sucks to think about ending a relationship with someone you care about, but you need to face facts. If you stay with him, he will continue giving her money, even if that is money you and your kids need. This woman will continue to be a destructive presence in your life.

It would be best to prioritize taking care of yourself and your close ones (spouse, kids). If it doesn't interfere with the first, taking care of the parents is good.

It sounds like an incompatibility issue that's a hard stop for you both.  It stinks, but living with an in-law is a pain in the ass...for both of you.  Then throw in kids?

This will never change. Get out now while you can, no matter what promises he makes to you on her behalf.", "NTA.  This is something you NEED to talk about, rather than stay together and someday have your boyfriend/husband spring this on you.  Your boyfriend has a complicated, enmeshed relationship with his mother and this is something you need to consider going forward because unless he sees the problem and wants to change it, it's not going to change and she's going to be an ongoing factor in your life as long as you're with him.\n\nJust a nickel's worth of free advice here... my husband and I have been married for 25 years.  He has issues with him family and always had.  Back when we got married, I felt like these were his issues to deal with with his family and I could just stay out of it.  Yeah... no.  His family is still dysfunctional, his way of dealing with them is still dysfunctional because learning relationship skills is hard and you have to want to put the work in to do it, and dealing with his family has been the number one cause of friction in our marriage.  It has definitely affected me and the kids as much (or more) than it affected us.  If you stay with this guy, his mom will be a part of your life and the life of future kids, and if he's not committed to making the relationship more functional, it's going to be a problem.  Just go into that with your eyes open because if it's a deal-breaker, it's better you know a year in than in ten years when you have a mortgage and a couple kids with this guy.\n\nI'm not saying I wouldn't have married my husband, but I would have made us get some counseling where we discussed how we were going to handle the relationship with his family going forward and where he could figure out how to stop feeding into the dysfunction by actually setting some limits with them, because it's not something he's been good at doing and it has caused us all (kids included) a lot of issues over the years.", "NTA at all, although I\u2019m gonna say from her lifestyle it sounds like she might not even make it long enough for it to be an issue", "NTA.

Or because she has gotten herself into an even worse situation and he feels responsible for helping her regardless if you leave or not.\n\nThis problem will not disappear. She will likely not get her life together. If he doesn't want to set boundaries and hold her responsible for taking care of herself, and is *voluntarily* setting up a living situation for her at your place.... I can tell you, he is not going to easily change the way he thinks. If he doesn't change the way he thinks, this is going to end you one way or another; you're going to leave him because she does move on, or he resents you for not letting his mother move in.\n\nYou need a long term solution for this problem, not just a right now solution.", "NTA and this is absolutely the hill to die on, I\u2019d get in freaking writing before marriage.

It's not his mom that's going to go down for it. It's going to be him. It's going to ruin his life, his reputation and everything because he is being an enabler and putting himself into position to hurt himself to help her to continue her bad habits.\n\nI'm going to be very very up front and honest with you and it's going to sound mean but you're enabling as well by allowing this to continue.\n\nI would literally sit him down and say it's either her or me because when he gets caught with those illegal substances it doesn't just affect his life. It affects yours too as you being his partner wife whatever. Why are you going to allow him to drag you down along this path for his mother who has no sympathy, regards or anything else for anybody and only cares about herself and is being selfish. You need to give that ultimatum and you need to stick to it. It's either her or you. To worry about you and your future. Not hers, not his. If he wants a future with you then he needs to cut her off and quit enabling her. Let her hit rock bottom.\n\nMy little sister passed away last year from an OD because she constantly was doing drugs. Was in a gang. Was committing crimes. She gave her life up for something we all tried to help her. Every one of us tried everything and she always went back to the drugs. They were more important and she gave the ultimate sacrifice. She hit rock bottom at the lowest part and now there's no coming back. I'll never get to see her again but I had to do the hard thing I had to stop enabling her. I didn't give her money. I didn't take her places. I didn't have anything to do with her for 7 years before she died. She made her choices. She wasn't ready to get clean. It was hard but it had to be done. All she did was bring my mother down. All her actions had consequences for my mother who was the biggest enabler for her. Ruined my mother financially ran people off from my mother's life because everybody got tired of being lied to stolen from mistreated and nothing happening is consequences for my sister's actions. Nobody wanted to be friends with my mom or be around my mom because she allowed it to happen. Don't let that be you stand up for yourself and stick to it. If it means that you have to break up with him and move on then so be it. Don't let her and him bring you down\n\nEdit for spelling", "NTA.  You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries.

Mom was dealing, out of their living room, when she was supposed to be watching the kids. (another stupid decision, but she raised him, so he thought she'd be fine with the kids.)\n\nMom FINALLY got kicked out, but still tracks him down for money and begs for more.  \n\nShort cut the process and run now.", "NTA.\n\nYou've been together for less than two years, you're not engaged and he's already talking about building a hypothetical house next to your home for his addict mother. Walk now. This is not going to get better.", "NTA. We all know this house next door will never materialize, she\u2019ll be living in your house.", "NTA\n\nAt home care for what? She can work but doesn\u2019t. She can get herself to a restaurant but gets there plastered. She could go out and buy her own weed but leaves her son with the shit storm that would ensue if he was caught buying it for her.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t need at home care. Unless he\u2019s planning on enabling her until her organs give out due to her lifestyle, she can put on her big girl panties and look after her damn self.\n\nAgain, NTA, but YWBTA if you let this continue. Because she will get sick eventually and then it will be a major problem.", "I would\u2019ve told him exactly what you did. Make sure he agrees or it\u2019s time to go.", ">She\u2019s an alcoholic\n\nNTA.  If your BF insists on enabling her, that's his cross to bear.  Don't let him make it yours.", "NTA. This isn't what you signed up for.", "I think you guys\u2019 relationship is doomed- especially if he\u2019s really serious about doing this. Don\u2019t give in, a break up sucks but having one when she\u2019s actively there will make things harder down the road.", "A year and a half together is nothing in the scheme of things, if you can't get him to see sense, save yourself", "NTA. He needs to go see a counselor that is familiar with substance abuse. He could wind up in jail getting Weed for her. He is also enabling her. Tell him in order for this relationship to continue you both have to go to Adult Children of Alcoholics or ALANON meetings. Both are free and you can even attend meetings online. Unless she wants to get help things will not change. If he insists on enabling her, walk away.", "Break up now, your up against an unbreakable mom son deal.  Get out before it\u2019s too late otherwise you\u2019re DOOMED", "I'm gonna say it doesn't matter what he agrees to today...\n\nSome time in the not too distant future, he will break this agreement to help his mom. Bet on it.", "NTA. Speaking from a person whose MIL lives WITH us(though she is not an addict, just codependent) after not ever having discussed this kind of situation prior to getting married, your life will be a constant state of stress. Mine is finally moving out after 7 long ass years, but the last 4 since I got pregnant and had my daughter have been the worst and my mental health has taken a dive. In my case I\u2019m at least comfortable having her near my child, she\u2019s just a terrible housemate and generally annoying to be around. In your case this would be detrimental to yourself and any potential kids. If your BF is supporting her now even with her settlement, what\u2019s that going to be like when it runs out? $40k doesn\u2019t last long, especially not in this economy.", "I\u2019m sorry girl but you can\u2019t change him and you can\u2019t change his mother. At her age this is the way she is. She\u2019s not gonna get a job and be the responsible person you wish she was. And he\u2019s always gonna resent you for saying no or do it anyways in 10 years.", "NTA.  You're setting boundaries for yourself and your future.  She's not trying to improve her situation, why should that fall on you?", "I hate to say it, but I agree with this assessment. When you feel that sense of obligation, it's hard to say no. He will either take care of her or resent you for not letting him take care of her. Or he does it on the sly and breaks your trust. \n\nIt may be easier to let him take care of his mom, at the cost of your relationship.", "NTA \n\nYou are being very reasonable in stating your position. \n\nFor sure he needs to stop enabling her as applies to the booze but especially the weed. If she wants that stuff let up her go get it and risk getting busted.  Depending on where he works if he gets busted for possession of weed (where it is illegal) it\u2019s possible he could endanger his current employment as well as future employment. \n\nI would suggest individual therapy for him to determine why he feels he needs to keep enabling her poor life choices by supporting her.  Maybe couples therapy if he thinks that would be more helpful.", "op=NTA\n\ngood thing you are saying this now.  Reddit will show you that this situation rarely goes well(if ever--adding qualifier-because AITA's don't tell the \"goes well\" side)", "Get him in therapy op. He needs to realize he's not responsible for her and he's enabling her . NTA", "I\u2019m definitely using it as a thing now \ud83d\ude06", "NTA. Your boyfriend needs to start going to a support group for families of alcoholics - or better yet, one for adult children of alcoholics. He cannot enmesh himself in trying to save her. She\u2019s a bottomless pit who will squeeze loved ones until they are dry. He\u2019ll get taken down, and your relationship with him will be a casualty. He cannot give her money. He cannot give her a place to stay. She has to want to get sober and get back on her feet. He\u2019s enabling, not helping.", "NTA.  However, think long and hard before getting married into this family.  You will end up dealing with this person for a long time.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend needs to attend a support group for relatives of alcoholics. He's doing everything wrong with her. And maybe being around other people in his shoes will show him that.\n\nAlso, it's good you have this out now whether you or his mom is going to be his priority.", "NTA  Your boyfriend may love his mother, but what he is doing is enabling her drinking and drug intake.  Walk away.", "Love this response. Thank you for the advice. I will surely heed it! I\u2019m done.", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened. Thank you for the advice, I will absolutely take it. I\u2019d rather be alone for the rest of my life than deal with that or his mother.", "Thank you for sharing, I\u2019m sorry for what happened to both your sister and mother and what you\u2019ve had to deal with. That\u2019s very difficult. Doesn\u2019t sound mean at all, sounds honest! I\u2019m ready to break it off. We have one international trip coming up in August, then I\u2019ll be moving to NC (many states away) for a job. He said he wants to follow me in a few months once he gets his resume together but I want it to end. I need to protect my own sanity", "Insane!! No way. I\u2019d make him my ex too.", "Thank you, I will absolutely do more digging to see if it\u2019s salvageable. Right now, I don\u2019t think it is. I\u2019m currently trying to move to a different state to get the hell away from his family and move back closer to mine. I do not have a parent like this. My parents are very loving and supportive so it\u2019s a shock to me that some parents are like this.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that, boundaries are everything!", "YES", "I agree, and thank you for sharing your story. I\u2019m sorry you dealt with that, boundaries are essential.", "My boyfriend says he plans to make \u201ca lot of money\u201d someday. Enough to support a village that\u2019s being burnt down by a deadweight and an expectant family?\n\nI don\u2019t want that in my future.", "Thank you for sharing, I absolutely agree. I feel for his plight but need to protect myself and my happiness. As well as my future and family.", "yes, yes, YES. I\u2019m sorry to hear about your mother as well but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to set boundaries.", "Thank you for sharing it from that perspective. My answers to your question: no and HELL NO.", "Thank you, I agree. Believe people the first time they show you who they are.", "True, but I see through that shit. A person like her doesn\u2019t change overnight.", "Yes, the lack of respect she has for him seems against nature and motherly instincts. I can\u2019t be in the same room as her anymore, let alone have her live beside me. It doesn\u2019t even make me sad anymore, it angers me to no extent. \n\nIf she hasn\u2019t matured by now, she never will.", "Beautifully said. I come from the same type of family as yours and he comes from a Mexican heritage that puts the pressure on the kids to provide, especially the eldest son. \n\nHe has a great job in the oil and gas industry and he throws his money away. I feel like he\u2019d try to deceive me and support his mother in any way possible.\n\nThank you for sharing.", "He cried and backed down from saying he wanted his mom to live with us. He said he wants to get her care because he believes she has \u201cearly onset Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d which is really just alcoholism. I need to break it off, I feel it in my heart and head. Excuses for her behavior will continue to be made.", "This is true, but an impetus does need to occur for someone to start changing. \u2018Rock bottom\u2019 is more of a general term for what the person perceives as their last straw. Looks different for everyone\u2014 does not have to be extreme such as death, homelessness, or imprisonment.", "Yes, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being paranoid to assume he\u2019d go behind my back to support them despite our \u201cagreement\u201d that his mom won\u2019t live with us or be supported by us. \n\nI believe in the institution of marriage and I want one husband and one husband only. But (in theoretical terms since we\u2019re not married) I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to divorce him for breaking the trust regarding this issue.", "That is a glorious phrase and I rejoice in your cephalopodic glory!!", "It\u2019s definitely a deal breaker NTA. I\u2019d also think of how much time you\u2019d be wasting on a relationship that\u2019s going nowhere.", "NTA - this is a burden he is looking for but perhaps expects you to share with him.", "It\u2019s a BS myth made up be the recovery industry to justify treating people like shit and perpetuate stigma against people who use drugs. I\u2019ll thank you not to talk down to me since it\u2019s clear you know far less about problematic substance use than I do. Again, you don\u2018t need to feel bad about setting appropriate boundaries for you and your family but you don\u2019t get to feel like you\u2019re doing her a favor.", "Don\u2019t you have your answer in this comment. He won\u2019t change and the high probability of a divorce in the future just isn\u2019t worth it.", "I don't get it when people say they are responsible because they are the eldest.  I have an elder sister.  I don't think she is any more responsible for taking care of our parents than I am.  (Not that they've asked us to do so)\n\nOnce you are all self-supporting adults, the eldest child thing stops, as far as I'm concerned.", "That's the one!", "Right on. Needing to hit rock bottom is made up, but I also don't think buying them alcohol and pot is helpful."]}
