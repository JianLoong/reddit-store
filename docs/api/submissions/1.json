Rules still apply.\n\n##This month\u2019s deep dive will be on Rule 12: No Debate Posts\n\nWhat exactly is a debate post? Simply put, any post where the discussion will focus on which side of a broad, often controversial topic is correct, rather than OPs actions. This includes politics, debates on various -isms, many issues surrounding marginalized groups, or stuff as simple as what brand of peanut butter is best (Skippy Extra Crunchy don\u2019t @ me).\n \nExamples of debate posts include but are not limited to:\n \n* Including (or not) a trans person in a gendered event\n \n* Using (or not) certain names and pronouns\n \n* Calling someone or being called racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic\n \n* To tip or not to tip\n \n* Anything involving politics or politicians\n\n* [Which is better, pie or cake](https://media.giphy.com/media/AgmrVi9b7YEow/giphy.gif)\n\n* Or any post that boils down to \u201cAITA for giving my opinion\u201d \n \nMarginalized groups, politics, and the confluence of marginalized groups and politics are the topics we see most often in debate posts. Politics and politicians are nearly always going to be a debate post because even if they\u2019re peripheral to the post itself, a debate over them inevitably springs up in the comments (keep this in mind; we\u2019ll come back to it in a moment). Issues surrounding marginalized groups are a bit fuzzier. A conflict involving someone from such a group is fine, but a conflict involving being in such a group is not. This is where questions about coming out, using correct pronouns, or being racist fall under the rule. It\u2019s not because the person is LGBTQ+ that the post is a debate post. It\u2019s because the post cannot be judged without people taking a position on the validity and dignity of that person\u2019s existence. [We went into a deeper dive on this point specifically a while back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/mis7n4/meta_rule_12_adjustments_and_new_lgbtqia_resource/)\n \nThis brings us back to debates springing up in the comments. A post that does not hit any of the above notes for being a debate post can still fall under Rule 12 if the comments take it as a debate prompt. We know that in the process of judging many posts will cause small debates to spring up. Where these debates turn a good post into a debate post is when they stop discussing the morality of the OP\u2019s actions and begin discussing the general merits of whatever topic is related. There are many subs formatted to accommodate debates and open discussions about these topics - this is not one. We are here to focus specifically on the morality of individual interpersonal conflicts.\nAnd that\u2019s not up for debate.\n \n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

People just explode in yelling and tears *that* often? \n\nAnd the absolutely bonkers things people care about is baffling. Do 16 year olds care what flavor cake their sibling has on that sibling\u2019s birthday?

I have a hard time believing there are that many people with sisters out there hard up for boyfriends, narcissistic enough to steal them from their own sister, that end up marrying the stolen boyfriend and that are on Reddit.\n\nThis topic seems like the perfect one to get upvoted because it\u2019s easy to answer, but because it\u2019s always X years (5-10 always looks good) since the theft this makes it legit. The inevitable upvoted answer is always, \u201cReddit doesn\u2019t care how long it\u2019s been, fuck em!\u201d\n\nIt helps that the thieving sister, even after X years is usually portrayed as still a crazy person just doing what they are doing for their own benefit.", "Saw it on FB but it's hilarious how threads with titles like \"I poisoned several people AITA\" usually end up with OP being a gentle soul while titles like \"I cooked a dinner for my loving wife AITA\" delve into Ted Bundy levels of sociopathy", "The OP: My MIL can be a bit petty sometimes\n\nThe commenters: MIL poisoned her water supply, burned her crops and delivered a plague unto her house!", "Why do people think \u201cyour house your rules\u201d is a complete argument?

I could see why someone would see that and think it means the post isn't allowed to have interpersonal conflict.", "Are there any rules around posts where the OP says they know they're in the right but want to make the post exclusively so they can show the comments to the other party involved?", "I have occasionally looked at the posts here toward what constitutes a unified theory of assholery.  One thing has cropped up, and it has to do with laws.  I occasionally see a post that goes something like \"I am not doing XYZ, the law says I don't have to, AITA?\"\n\nThe  law represents the minimum obligation we owe to each other, stuff like don't kill and don't steal.  A person has a lot of discretion to go beyond what the law requires in the course of showing compassion and decency to others.  If a person justifies their actions by saying \"Well, I don't HAVE to,\" there is generally a good chance they are the asshole.", "Every wedding post on this sub always involves a mother-in-law getting angry at the wife/husband for XYZ and the OP wonders if they are the asshole for not including XYZ in the wedding.", "I am noticing a lot of posts being removed because the poster\u2019s original account is shadowbanned or suspended. I\u2019m also noticing a whole lot of posts that seem really, really far fetched and unbelievable.

It seems like a post asking whether something WOULD be an asshole move are more advice seeking? There's no interpersonal conflict if it hasn't happened yet.", "When a comment gets reported, do the mods just look at the comment itself, or do they also look at the post to get context around the comment?\n\nFor example, there was a post in /new last night that was very clearly someone in a psychotic episode who had a delusion around a picture if a statue they saw being cursed. There was a comment basically saying \"yeah the statue is cursed and now you've put your family at risk\". In context this is an insanely cruel thing to say to a delusional person, but may not come across that way without context.", "Am I the only one who doesn't believe the constant influx of \"I'm so skinny and fat people are constantly body shaming me and insulting me\" or \"This fat person didn't know their size and tried on my skinny people clothes and ruined them\" stories we get here?

And then every comment saying NTA and repeating and copying what the OP said!\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me but they get on my nerves, you can just tell by the title sometimes. \n\nLike AITA for now allowing my friend to bring in XYZ which I am severely allergic too? Obviously not!!", "Why is everyone on this sub the absolute most? Lol.

Some people just really overshoot _hard_ in the comments, calling people pedophiles or rapists because they \"have a feeling\", when neither post nor comments have any evidence of that whatsoever.

The posts I've paid most attention to involve Judaism and those posts almost always become discussions about either the validity of a person's Judaism or whether they're practicing the religion correctly, whatever that means. \n\nThen there are the posts from a Mormon perspective which quickly turn into discussions about the Mormon Church and not the poster's behavior. \n\n  \nWould the mods consider expanding this language to specifically call out religion as a topic that also generates debate posts?", "[deleted]", "I want to give props to whoever authored the extremely short-lived post asking if they were the AH for blowing up their neighborhood bully's favorite bridge.

They're not even really interested in making a judgment, they just seize on some tiny detail of a post and go to town until it's twisted beyond recognition. They're just out for blood and if  they can't find anything to twist they say the OP isn't telling the whole story and *must* be hiding something, based on I don't know what. It's like they can't stand for the OP to not be an asshole.\n\nLike the story on the front page now about OP sending her two teenage sisters home from a trip after they followed the OP's husband while he was with a female business client, taking pictures of them and being rude when confronted. People are bending over backwards to make all the adults involved assholes. Unbelievable how many people are absolutely convinced the husband's cheating based solely on him being in a \"rage\" about the incident. Oh, and being in a \"rage\" means he has anger problems. It's just dumb teenage stuff and the OP, husband, and client failing to understand this HAS to mean something shady is happening. Husband and OP couldn't possibly care about a business relationship being jeopardized.", "Unrelated question: what\u2019s the difference between top and best answers?

Especially those with INFO requests.\n\nSince the post text is already preserved by an automod, there's no worry about losing the story (if automod is pinned), and people can still see everything. OP just won't get the karma for it.\n\nMost people use throwaways, so even if the post is genuine and OP doesn't answer for legitimate reasons, chances are they won't care about the karma itself, since they too can still see the thread and all the comments.\n\nOP interacting not only makes the sub more enjoyable and satisfying, but it can help making accurate judgments.\n\nAnd while we're all here to get our IV drip of trash and drama, there are people who need actual help, and a lot of commenters do try and give useful advice.", "I feel like the vast majority of this sub is out of touch with reality.

I've never reported it though b/c I'm not sure if that helps.  Example:  I voted NAH on a post where the OP identified as trans but the post was not related to that fact.

I got comments on my post that weren't easy to read, or that I didn't agree with, but in respect of the rule I'd avoid downvoting simply based on my emotional reaction. \n\nThe downvotes on Reddit might just be 'fake internet points', but it's disheartening to see users using the button against Rule 2 to express their unhappiness against a poster's viewpoint when they're simply trying to answer questions they were actually asked. It'd be a different matter if I was uncivil or didn't accept my judgment, of course - but I did my level best to respect those rules. \n\nI trawl the Open Forum quite often, and I've seen other people's grievances over various issues on this subreddit, some I agree with, some I don't. But I personally think a lot of demands on the mods are a little unfair when our community so regularly violates the second-most important rule on the sub. We all choose to participate in AITA - no one is forcing us, and we can leave when we want. As a community, I think we can all do our part to make the subreddit more welcoming and helpful to others. Even when they're the Asshole, like I was yesterday.\n\nJust my rather long two cents.", "Would telling someone they shouldn\u2019t have had kids be considered uncivil? I frequently see highly upvoted comments telling an OP that they\u2019re an asshole for having x amount of kids and I always felt it was a disgusting thing to say to people. That their own children, whom they love, should have never been born and were a mistake. Seems almost violent tbh. Imagine telling someone they should have been aborted, obviously that would break the civility rules. \n\nIt\u2019s also usually thinly veiled classism because it\u2019s used against people who \u201ccan\u2019t provide\u201d for their kids, and the providing in question is just not being able to take them on international vacations or pay for their out of state college tuition.\n\nEdit: would also like to add that given the state of abortion in the US this is not something ANYONE should be allowed to say to a stranger.", "Another reason I love rule 11: People on this sub are so closed minded and judgey about any relationship that is different from what they want in a relationship, to the point of flat out insulting anyone with different preferences.   \n\n\nFor example I just read a comment that said if someone isn't willing to cut contact with a lifelong, strong friendship, who they happened to have casual sex with at one point, because their romantic partner gives them an ultimatum after 2 years of dating, they are inherently disrespectful of their partner and if they can't automatically choose their partner then their partner deserves better.  \n\n\nMeanwhile my long term, loving partner and I are sitting on the couch, drinking tea and chuckling because both of us have friends with legitimate exes, and I'm friends with some past FWB, and both of us feel far MORE respected that we each acknowledge our friendships are important to us and are not jealous of each other having friends. I feel respected because he trusts me, and he feels respected because I trust him. I feel respected because he values my autonomy, and he feels respected because I value his. We both know we can have discussions about issues without giving ultimatums, because we we discussed our dealbreakers early on, and we trusted each other to be honest about them. Neither one of us waited a few years and then tried to change the other. And both of us would value breaking up if we're truly incompatible, even though it would be emotionally horrible for awhile, because we want to find someone right for us, not find someone good enough and then change them to be who we want them to be. Lucky us, we're pretty sure we are right for each other, but have the foresight to know things change and it's not always someone's fault. We'd rather go through the emotional difficulty for a period of time and then ultimately find a more compatible relationship, than be in one where we feel passionately about each other but are unhappy over time due to our differences.  \n\n\nTo which people would argue that it's not inherently bad to not want to date someone who's friends with their ex, which is exactly my point from the beginning so I can smile and say glad you agree. People can want different things in a relationship, and someone not wanting their partner to be friends with someone they've slept with is valid, but so is someone not wanting a partner who demands they cut contact with friends because they feel threatened. No one is unreasonable for their dealbreakers, but it's unreasonable to date someone for 2 years who breaks a dealbreaker and then spring an ultimatum on them now that they've developed more emotional investment. Dealbreakers are for ending possible relationships in those first couple weeks precisely to AVOID dating someone incompatible and having to have a more emotional breakup/issues years later. Having a dealbreaker is not unreasonable. Having a dealbreaker you don't share for 2 years after dating someone who you know breaks your dealbreaker IS unreasonable, and disrespectful.  \n\n\n....And that rant is why I'm glad rule 11 exists.", "If a thread in the comments devolves into a debate, should we report the post, one or more of the comments, or send a modmail?", "What is the point of this sub if you just downvote anyone that disagrees with you?", "There was a post a day or two agao about a guy pledging for a fraternity but his gf was mad he had to do an event with frat and not spend time with her.

Or pin it to the top of every post but automatically collapsed so it doesn\u2019t take up as much space? I primarily use Reddit on the mobile app, and I often have trouble finding the copy comment, especially on really popular posts with multi-thousand comments. It\u2019s easy to miss when I sort by top and it only has single-digit upvotes, or I have to keep scrolling and scrolling through every comment to get to the bottom when I sort by new.

And many people, including myself, read a post with our own biases and projections from our past experiences. For example, if a conflict is about one roommate being clean and the other being messy, some Redditors might think \"I've lived with a slob and it's terrible!\" others will think \"I've lived with an obsessive clean freak and it was terrible!\" but we have no way to measure how clean or messy, reasonable or unreasonable the individuals in the Reddit conflict post were, since the post is described from a subjective view.\n\nHowever, there IS absolutely a trend in society of increasingly identifying and naming abusive or harmful dynamics, identifying mental and behavior health difficulties, recognizing cognitive diversity among humans, etc... that have previously been glossed over, and I don't think that's a bad thing.\n\nAt the end of the day, we also have our own personal standards for what is \"overblown\".

Every meme is beaten to death and then the mangled corpse gets dragged through the streets for a few more months.", "I've been thinking a lot about in-jokes such as \"marinara flags\" from a theory-of-humor perspective and what makes them funny or not funny. Fundamentally, they are a way of showing that you're part of the group, and feeling part of the community. (Of course, recognizing \"marinara flag\" is a very superficial sort of community membership.)\n\nBut clearly many people find \"marinara flag\" genuinely funny and aren't just signaling, which is a bit of a puzzle. One possibility is that it's funny because it's a reference to something funny, but that's not really the case. \"Poop knife\" is an objectively funny story, but someone thinking \"marinara\" means \"red\" is not. The first \"marinara flag\" joke was moderately funny at the Reddit pun level (producing epistemic confusion that then gets resolved by a shift of meaning) but not worthy of references months later. I think it falls into the category of \"This is funny because people have decided it's funny\"  but that's not a very satisfying explanation.\n\nSo what I'm still trying to figure out is why in-jokes are funny. (Personally, I find \"what air defense doing\" repeatedly amusing, an in-joke in another community, but I can't really explain why.) Many memes (e.g. \"is this loss\") involve creativity in their use, and a moment of recognition and understanding that provides a basis for humor. But \"marinara flags\" is explicitly not creative; people don't substitute \"marinara\" for \"red\" in, say, \"marinara car\" or \"marinara hair\".\n\nResearch has found that something won't be perceived as funny if it produces a stronger emotion. (E.g. if your brother died from X, you probably won't find jokes about X funny.) So it's possible that \"marinara flag\" jokes are actually funny, but some people find them irritating and the irritation blocks the humor, so I just don't recognize the humor.\n\nThere's also the possibility that \"marinara flags\" is a meta-joke in a sense, poking fun at AITA's excessive use of cliches such as \"red flags\" by creating a new cliche that mocks the original cliche. But this is probably overthinking the joke since I don't think this is how people view it. \n\nAs far as \"The Iranian yogurt is not the issue here\u201d, I think the situation is a bit different. That has become an idiom meaning \"The superficial issue being discussed is not the real problem; there's something deeper going on.\" Since it provides a short way of expressing that idea, it's genuinely useful. The underlying story is also moderately funny.\n\nBackground: People on AITA often suggest telling someone to \"Explain why that's funny\". This got me thinking about why something is funny or not, and I read a lot of the literature on theories of humor; it turns out there are dozens of contradictory theories on what makes something funny. I've been applying these theories to things on AITA, but \"marinara flag\" is still a bit of a puzzle. I haven't been able to find any papers explaining the theory behind in-jokes (and Googling for \"in joke\" is hopeless), so if anyone has info, let me know.\n\nThis may be more than anyone wants to know about AITA jokes, but hopefully some people will find this analysis interesting.", "What's the art studio joke?", "The Iranian yogurt comments seem less like jokes and more like a succinct way of saying \"I think the primary issue here is not the issue you're focusing on. There's something else going on that's probably more important.\" but to be fair, not everyone will understand that one.   \n\n\nBefore marinara flags was coined, people were complaining equally hard about comments that used the phrase 'red flag', which is essentially what marinara flags mean (I also don't think of that as a joke besides the first thread it was used, but more so a different way of saying red flag, and I don't think people need to know the original thread to get what it means).  \n\n\nI guess instead of me saying \"I don't understand \\_\\_\\_\", which I am inclined to do all too often despite it not being productive,  I should do the more constructive thing and ask (and genuinely listen) - Is there a reason marinara flags bother you more than other trite phrases (eg play stupid games win stupid prizes, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, that's too much reddit for one day, etc) , or even more than just saying 'red flag'?", "The bot alerts us when the top comment has multiple judgments or no judgments. When that happens we manually assign a judgment based on the next highest comment with a valid judgment.\n\nWhen the second case you mentioned happens, it tends to be a \"two judgments in one comment\" situation (commenters sometimes strikethrough their old judgment and add their new judgment rather than removing their old judgment altogether). A human eye will identify the new judgment and assign the judgment based on that.\n\nIf there is only one sarcastic judgment in the top comment, we're out of luck unfortunately. Judgment Bot cannot identify sarcasm, so we encourage commenters to use the judgments as they are meant.

It's just that infertile is not a statement that having kids is impossible, just a reflection on what has occurred so far (and indicates chances of fertility are lower).", "I absolutely understand where you're coming from here.

But there's still going to be posts that fall under the threshold that are still a bear to read.

Generally, those complete jerks don't have enough empathy to question their part in the conflict. Example: PS5-selling deadbeat father and ex-wife stalker only posted in retaliation to his son's post. Most of the hot posts that fire people up and don't get taken down are posted from the viewpoint of the more reasonable, rational party, who does have the ability to consider both sides and wonder if they maybe were a jerk in the situation, like the Kung Poa Chicken post. \n\nJust my thoughts.

Then it would be cheating and the person would have every right to give the ultimatum of either stopping contact or ending the relationship.\n\nOther than that I totally agree that deal breakers should be made clear at the beginning of a relationship not suddenly developed years into it.\nPretty much the same goes for getting annoyed about a habit your significant other has (like leaving their dirty clothes all over the place) that they always had, but all of a sudden and way into the relationship it becomes this huge issue. I understand that the overall situation may change - a new baby might be involved or the living situation might have changed - but it still reads like someone thought they could change their partner and turn them in their ideal of a partner which is pretty disrespectful towards them. You either accept a partner as they are or you move on.\n\nI believe that both - suddenly making up new deal breakers and taking a big issue of things that have always been that way - are probably less about the actual issue, but more about problems that reach deeper.\n\nAlso, you're absolutely right that people shouldn't just judge on how their perfect relationship would look like. Everyone is different and so different things work for everyone. I've recently watched a bunch of shorts on YT of a mom giving advice on raising kids and the most important thing she said at the end of those clips was that that advice may not work for everyone, but it works for them.\n\nAlso little disagreements shouldn't be blown up out of proportion.

They don't share the details of these, because they don't want the trolls to know how to avoid getting caught.  \n\n\nThe shitpost rule also covers presenting conflicts fairly and accurately, I'm not sure their exact criteria for that, but I've reported some of the most extreme cases and they were removed.   \n\n\nHonestly mods are super upfront about the rules and how they apply them. Sometimes people don't like the rules, but they're there, so we can either follow them, make a suggestion here, not use the sub, or break the rules and accept they will get removed/might get banned at some point.  \n\n\n I think it also often comes down to people not understanding the nuances of the rules, which include things we wouldn't necessarily expect without reading the FAQs or asking for clarification in these monthly threads (eg rule 5 can have a lot of nuances and includes more actions than just physical assault, or it's hard to know where the line is sometimes). I've found if I misunderstood a rule or had a question about the specifics, asking here is a pretty quick way to get an explanation. If a removal seems counter intuitive (which I agree they CAN be), I recommend asking for clarity first.", "They get away with high rates and low wages because we keep using the service. I actually think the cost would more likely go down if consumers stopped ordering, but right now service fees are low enough for people to keep using it, and high enough for people to complain about how expensive it is.   \n\n\nAlso friendly tipping suggestion - Giving drivers cash as a tip instead of adding it to the car gets more money to the driver and less to DoorDash (at least doordash, not sure about others).  \n\n\nThey claim they don't take any of the tips, which is TECHNICALLY true, but what they do is if the driver makes enough tips they can reduce how much they're paying the driver.  \n\n\nI know a lot of people don't keep cash these days, but if you are looking to get more money to the drivers and less to the leechy companies, that's a good way.  \n\n\nBut also...What's this comment about? Does it relate to a post or are you just sharing info cause knowledge is power! :)", "People should just do their job and blame the employers for not paying them enough, instead of putting the responsibility onto the customers.

Nearly every time I see someone make one of those \"but if the genders were reversed\" comments in a post it turns out those \"exact same posts\" have wildly different details that significantly change what happened.  My favorite example of this was in a pair of posts where someone's partner peed in the shower.\n\nIn one the couple was taking a shower together when the woman decided to pee, trying to hit the drain. This was the first time it happened. She didn\u2019t pee on the guy at all. The guy \u201cadmittedly yelled at her and called her disgusting\u201d, and was deemed the asshole for his reaction.\n\nIn the other post the guy had a habit of peeing in the shower when they were together and she repeatedly asked him not to. On the tenth time he peed directly on her leg she called him an asshole and left the shower. The guy then too was deemed the asshole.\n\nWhen the second of the two posts came along there was at least one major comment shouting \u201cbUt LoOk WhEn ThE gEnDeRs ArE fLiPpEd\u201d and even linked to the other post, completely ignoring that the details between the two are wildly different so of course they're going to be judged differently.\n\nNearly every time I see those comments trying to draw comparisons between posts they are that significantly different. Even when the specific actions are similar, men and women are treated significantly different by society in ways that impact the reactions. Men routinely demean women by refusing to refer to call them doctor while freely calling men doctor; that kind of systemic sexism will impact how one reacts and views those situations. \n\nAll of this is to say I'm not saying that what you're describing isn't happening, but I am saying that I've seen that accusation made for literally the entire time I was modding and before. It's a frequent drum that MRA hate groups beat (including subs that were so vile reddit finally banned them).", "The reason that is offensive/bigoted is mimicking what their impression of some specific cerebral palsy walk is, is not actually communicating what cerebral palsy is or some grand way of transcending language barriers.\n\nCerebral Palsy can look a million different ways, and there can be many reasons someone would walk the way I imagine that OP was probably walking (didn't read the post, just off your description).\n\nSure, not every person with cerebral palsy would find that offensive. But I can think of at least 5 off the top of my head who would, as well as others with developmental or mobility related disabilities. It's not absurd to call this action ableist, even if it wasn't intended that way.\n\nIntention is not the only factor in whether something is offensive or not. A huge chunk of offensive things people do and say are actually not ill-intended. Doesn't make them less problematic. **We don't have a right to be shielded from the discomfort of our accidentally hurtful behaviors or words being 'called out'. Why people seem so ready to attack the person critiquing someone else's behavior or statement for not doing it \"perfectly\" or how they would like them to do it, but just as eager to defend the person who actually caused harm because \"sometimes we might express ourselves poorly\" is a terrible double standard that is far too prominent. And it usually is a double standard in favor of who we relate to most in that given situation...**\n\nI guess I can ask - Why do you think this student needs to be protected because their ableism was \"an accident\" and \"we don't say things perfectly\", and yet you're attacking everyone who says the behavior is offensive because they didn't say it the way you wanted them to say it?

There's something irreparably damaged we won't be bouncing back from, because trust is a necessity for me in a relationship, and if I have to ask my partner not to see someone because I don't trust them (with a reason or not), then they are not the partner for me because the foundation of trust isn't there.   \n\n\nCheating is also a dealbreaker for me, but I know some couples talk about successfully recovering from it. Kudos to them, I've seen some impressive stories of couples healing, but I'm not willing to put in the pain and labor to recover what I thought I had, and I'm not sure I'd be capable of it anyway. Part of why cheating is a dealbreaker for me is because I'm very open to non-monogamous serious relationships, and I'm open to monogamous serious relationships, so if we're monogamous it's because my partner wanted it, which makes cheating all that shittier because they wanted me to be exclusive to them and not vice versa.  \n\n\nI agree about the \"annoying habit\" thing too! Sure, there will probably be something or a few things our partners do that are a little annoying, but that's usually more like \"ugh, they sometimes forget to turn off the lamp when they go to bed, and they make funny noises when we're watching movies\". And heck, half the time we find the annoying idiosyncrasies cute or at least tolerable, because what annoys the heck out of one person could be perfectly fine with another, but the posts where someone goes \"My partner of 4 years is a slob who never cleans and I'm stressed out and fed up. They've always been this way and I've been asking them for 4 years to contribute to cleaning\" usually get responses of \"you poor baby that shouldn't be on you, he sounds gross.\" When my mental response is \"Yeah that's gross. My solution? Don't fucking date someone like that for *years* and then suddenly be outraged they haven't changed, because that situation was completely avoidable if you were willing to have standards to begin with and/or not date someone with the assumption they'll change down the road.\"", "Good to know.

And while cerebral palsy obviously can look different ways, that kind of walk is one of the more commonly known symptoms. When we try to explain/identify something we normally use the most common known things or even stereotypes associated with this. You would describe a swan as a large, white bird with a long neck even though there are also black swans, you would describe a human being as having two legs even though there are people who list their legs or are born without them, and you would describe a dessert as being a hot place with a lot of sand even though there may be also rock formations and oases.\n\nIf you say intent isn't the only factor in whether something is offensive or not, I'm guessing you mean that it's all about the feelings and emotions it creates in the people being offended or even those that just may/could feel offended. But if you use that as a benchmark, you could utter a simple, absolutely normal sentence of \"Those autumn colored trees with their red leaves look beautiful.\" and someone could call you ableist and inconsiderate because some people can't see colors and therefore might find someone praising beautiful colors offensive.\n\nI also never said anyone should be shielded from the discomfort of others they might have accidentally caused. But there is a clear difference between just going into a rant and calling the alleged offender all sorts of names, or giving them a chance to explain why they did/say something (aka their intentions) and letting them know that others are/might be offended by it.\n\nAs far as your question goes the answer is pretty simple: Because to me the intention of someone's actions do matter quite a bit. Someone who didn't mean to offend others should not be called names or ableist/racist/sexist (depending on the context) simply because they just aren't those things. Those who are calling that person those names do so with the actual intent to shame and judge them without caring whether they actually are those thing, and without caring that any of these things are actually offensive for that person. (I'm actually not sure whether I expressed myself clearly here...)\n\nLet me illustrate this issue with an example, even though it might not a perfect analogy.\n\nSituation 1: The sibling (S) of the person who's birthday it is (B) is carrying the cake out into the backyard. On their way S trips and the cake ends up on the floor utterly ruined. B is upset. A party guest (G) just sees the cake on the floor and starts yelling at S how she could just destroy the cake and make B upset.\n\nSituation 2: S doesn't really like and is jealous of B. When ask to bring the cake S just throws it on the ground. B is upset and G is yelling at S again.\n\nIn situation 1 S didn't intend to destroy the cake so G is totally in the wrong for yelling and implying this. B is entitled to being upset and S should apologize to B or at least acknowledge that B feels upset. but that's as far as it should go. In situation 2 on the other hand S intentionally destroyed the cake, so G is totally justified in their tirade. S needs to apologize and be punished appropriately.", "[deleted]", "And what?    please tell me what  are you talking about?  \u201cI was an insult?\u201d  WHAT??", "don\u2019t disagree, just saw saw it and was reminded that we\u2019re in halloween season", "im not sure if i can link sources about this, but starting around the 40\u2019s or so spook was used to refer to Black ppl, kinda like the n word. it\u2019s not super well known as a slur which is why i brought it up. it\u2019s not as prevalent as a slur in our day to day life, it\u2019s just something to be aware of imo. people should be able to make informed choices \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "OP was sharing information, not making accusations. please be kind.", "I don't want to presume anyone's race, act like I have any authority here or act like some black people speak for all, but I also think it's worth noting that context matters and this is one of those things that pretty much all my black friends and relatives (we've got ourselves a racially diverse family) would roll their eyes at a bit as 'trying too hard to be woke they go in the opposite direction\", but again, it's not like everyone feels the same way, so comes down to 'treat people how they want to be treated'. I have grown more careful of projecting what I might assume is offensive to someone onto them when they don't find it offensive, because doing so is ironically, sometimes more offensive (better described below).  \n\n\nSpook didn't originate as a slur, but was used offensively/as a slur for a good chunk of time there. The friends and family I referenced earlier would absolutely call those uses, or probably the use of the word at all during that time, offensive or racist. However using it appropriately to describe Halloweeny things, or using it as it's intended 'scary' use, is not generally considered racist. One of my friends actually just went on a rant about calling a word like spooky racist when its used in the appropriate, innocuous, intended way is counter-productive, because then it perpetuates the insult/association, when it's a GOOD thing that association is not prevalent anymore.  \n\n\nAgain, not saying everyone necessarily has the same opinion on this, and I do agree it's never a bad thing to share the info/be aware/be educated. But if there's something I have sharply, sharply learned the past years, it's to be careful about projecting what I think might be offensive, especially given context.

Because I don't see anywhere where I suggested teens can never be told they're wrong. I've made the argument that it's *helpful* to tell teens they're wrong when done well. But dismissing their feelings is NOT a productive way to tell them they're wrong, even if that's the message you want to get through. Because it doesn't target the actual wrong behavior, it's just a generalized insult based on age. For example \"You're just young and resentful\" isn't anywhere close to \"It sounds like your step parent is trying hard, and it's understandable your parent wanted to move on in a new relationship. Is it possible your anger is coming from resisting change/hurtful feelings regarding your parents breaking up/etc whatever is relevant...Could you try doing XYZ and see if that helps?\"\n\nBecause let's be real, a teen is never wrong \"because they're a teen\", they're wrong if they do something wrong.

Other than the unspoken rule of *have an original thought.*", "Sorry, it's just hard to tell when someone is being hyberbolic or not because sometimes, people come on the open forum to complain about judgements that, if read in context, were actually pretty reasonable or at least far less obviously evil than the comment makes them sound. \n\nI agree that sometimes, there is too much hostility against parents who try their best. At the same time, there are still those who deserve to be told off, and most of them are careful enough not to admit any kind of abuse.  Sometimes, there can be red flags only visible to people who were victims themselves, and sometimes the entire issue is just controversial enough that everyone will have a different opinion on it.\n\nETA: Actually, that brings us back 'round to your initial question and this month's topic of choice, because I now wonder if, rather than incivility, it could be seen as breaking the No Debate rule and if we should instead message the mods if we see such hidden red flags or the controversial topics. \nHmm. Mods?", "While I agree that the point can be made in a civil or uncivil manner and SHOULD be made in a civil one, the harsh truth is the right to parent should not be inalienable.\n\nSomeone should not be inherently not allowed to have kids because of class, and plenty of poor or financially struggling parents do a great job. Ideally, we'd live in a society that takes care of its citizens enough where class is not an inherent barrier to having children, because we would ensure the needs of children are met. It's also not an inherent insult to suggest someone is not in the position to have kids. Because if someone cannot financially care for their children, that doesn't mean they wouldn't be a great parent. It's an *unfortunate* situation that is a result of systemic inequality, but the children should not be the ones to suffer the consequences. It's not saying the parent isn't a good person or wouldn't be a good parent, just that due to a horrible reality in this world (that we should try to change!), their wants might need to be set aside for the well being of children.\n\nHowever, that isn't the world, and when it comes down to it, it's my opinion the child's well-being should trump a parent's desire to have their billionth child, especially when their decisions are actively harming their children, despite our current society deciding that children aren't real people with real rights who matter, but rather extensions of their parents to do what they will with.\n\nIn the post you mention, I'm sure many of the comments were uncivil and not appropriate. But the message that someone who can barely manage their current children without putting their eldest in an unfair position (and acting like it's the eldest's burden because they're the eldest, when the eldest is not choosing to have more siblings) should consider their limitations in a pragmatic way is spot on.\n\nAnd while I'm not a teen, nor have I been for awhile (I say this because for whatever reason this sub has decided teens aren't allowed to have opinions), I really think the standard for parents is too low and often 'parental rights' are prioritized over the tangible well being of children. People don't ask to be born, many wish we weren't, and so I don't see taking care of your children properly as some heroic action. People have kids because THEY want them, not as a gift to the children. It's an inherently selfish act (unless it was forced of course), so people who have kids on purpose and then complain about it or act like their children should be grateful for just being alive, really don't garner much of my sympathy.\n\nAs a non-class related example, if an incredibly wealthy couple kept having children when they each work 80 hours a week and rarely see the children, I would judge that as well, not because they don't have the financial capacity to raise children, but because they don't have the time or emotional capacity that I think children deserve from their parents.", "I think there are a few ways to look at this. Will the child \u201csurvive\u201d and \u201cbe okay\u201d if the parents have 3,4,8 kids? As long as there\u2019s no obvious abuse etc then sure\u2026however you\u2019re certainly not setting up those kids for the best either. Lots of kids means limited attention and resources to each. The data shows kids who are read to/interacted regularly, have stimulus rich environments and are given more access to more opportunity are more likely to thrive and have more enriching and fulfilled lives. \n\nParents are humans with limited resources, and with more kids comes less resources per kid. At a point it is selfish.", "Absolutely this.\n\nFor me personally cheating is an absolute deal breaker as well. The only kinda exception for this would be keeping up appearances when there would be a child about to take their finals at school, going through chemotherapy, or something like this, where they just didn't need any additional emotional stress. But it would be a case of keeping it up for the child's sake and otherwise keep your distance, and once that critical time has passed it would be \"bye, bye\".\n\nWhat I also don't understand are these on and off relationships. For me they feel a bit like sanctioned cheating, because they were in an off period of the relationship anyway. Also if it didn't work out the last time(s), what makes them think this time - just a few weeks/months later - makes it any different? It's like if they either aren't willing to put in the effort to work through their issues, or aren't emotionally invested enough in the first place, why bother?\n\nWhen it comes to wanting to change your partner, I think the only thing that would be acceptable is trying to interest them in things your interested yourself, like introducing him to different kinds of food he might have never had, taking him to a sports game or a theater play depending on the personal interests, or involving them in your hobbies. The important thing is that it should never be forced on them, because it's okay to be interested in different things and do things separately from each other. One should also keep in mind that this should never be a one way street, if you want your partner to show interest in the things you like, you also need to be open to the things they like. And even if you don't find that common ground you should still encourage and support your partner in pursuing their interests.", "Spam is best I think.  It\u2019s what most people reporting them have been for and those reports go to the admins as well so they can better take action too.  I notice a fair amount that get a pile of spam reports will get sitewide banned after we ban them from the sub (some the admins even catch before us).", "Hah, yeah, RIP to many many OP comments if we had that.", "Worth adding also that you can sort the comments by /old to find that automod copy.  For some reason this isn't an option on the official ios app though.", "one of the big reasons we don't allow conflicts related to covid is that we don't want to give people the opportunity to spread misinformation. we also aren't medical experts, so moderating a post about covid would be well beyond our abilities.", "https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole", "If you're hankering for some snazzy user flair, sometimes the most effective way to participate is to hang out in /new and comment your best judgments on every post that interests you. Many, many posts end up being flaired (with the judgment from the most upvoted top comment at 18 hours) after receiving only a few dozen comments. If you're one of the early commenters, you'll have a better shot at being voted top comment. And more importantly, on the posts that only receive minimal attention, your judgment and feedback may be even more helpful and meaningful to the OP.", "I agree contest mode has frustrated me at times. Though I think the issue of it being a chaotic mess is normally localized to the threads that gain a lot of comments very quickly, so it feels impossible to sort through.  \n\n\nBut with a lot of new posts that are in contest mode, I think it's helpful, and actually look at it as an opportunity to use my upvotes to elevate the comments I think should be seen/rise to the top.   \n\n\nPeople who post in those first few minutes already have an advantage with upvotes, regardless of the quality of the comment. If the post is going to be NTA overall, and maybe a few YTAs, then after the first NTA comment, the next person who sees the thread might upvote it. When a second one is added, the next viewer might upvote the first AND the second (because the first is already at the top after just one or two upvotes). Then as they come in, even if there are higher or lower quality NTA comments, that first one will always be at the top and probably get more upvotes first, with comments even 15 minutes later falling to the bottom.   \n\n\nAside from that, know a post is in contest mode helps me engage in critical thinking in a more conscious way. I'm not gonna lie, I can get swayed by the first handful of comments I see. Sometimes that's good, sometimes it's not. If I had an initial opinion but then someone makes a good point that changes my mind, that's positive in my book. But if I'm not sure of a verdict, read one comment and go \"that checks out, and it's at the top so others agree\", it might sway my vote in a way that's actually lazy/unproductive on my end. When contest mode is enabled, I'm looking at all comments more \"equally\" and ensuring I make up my mind based on both my own opinions and weighing the soundness of other comments.   \n\n\nMy two cents. There are absolutely times it's a chaotic mess that makes it difficult to sort through, so I really do get the frustration. It's the pros and cons of sorting by new. But participating while a post is in contest mode is one of the most impactful ways to participate on this sub in my experience.", "I agree. I honestly dont understand why this sub is so picky with posts. Like, if a post isn\u2019t about something you care about, just ignore it?  I see so many posts everyday that I\u2019m like \u201coh.  This is interesting, Id like to comment\u201d only to see comments are locked because it\u2019s about a relationship.", "Not a mod, but I can offer my interpretation of that part of the FAQ / my personal 2 cents.\n\nI did not interpret the FAQ to suggest absolutely NO post about a relationship could ever exist, but specifically no posts if the conflict can ONLY occur in the context of a romantic relationship, or if it's about partings, consent, etc...\n\nThing is, consent is broader than just \"I am agreeing or not agreeing to go on a date with you.\" I think pretty much any romantic relationship specific post I can imagine would boil down to one or both of 2 things: Consent or advice.\n\nIf a conflict can only exist in a romantic relationship, it either comes down to \"look, any of you can have your own relationship preferences, whether I like them or not, and the other person can have theirs as well. The two of you can choose to work through it or not date.\" Or, for the conflicts that most people (including the poster) do not find significant enough to be a break up dealbreaker, it's still not about who is right or wrong, but advice on how to navigate that for the sake of the health of the relationship. Because romantic relationships are a constant, active choice, everyone involved consents to or ends on an ongoing basis. You don't only consent at the beginning and end. As new things arise, you are extending or removing consent. As ridiculous as *I* think someone might be in a relationship, it's really between the two or more of them what they're consenting to and willing to navigate together.\n\nI absolutely think certain behaviors in a relationship are wrong. However, if someone else is only willing to continue to be in a relationship where X can happen even if I personally think X is wrong, it's still their decision (and often the only way to ethically execute that decision is to simply not date). If someone only wants their partner to wear certain types of clothes, I think that's super controlling. However, it's unreasonable to say they HAVE to stay in a relationship with someone who wears clothes they're uncomfortable with. Likely any comment would start with the gist of \"you can't control what your partner wears\" followed up by either \"so break up with them if it's a problem\" (partings) or \"So suck it up and deal with it\" (consent). So at that point, it does come down to consent and/or partings.", "This sub doesn't ban posts about conflicts that occur *within* romantic or sexual relationships. It bans posts *about* those relationships.", "Oh that's a good point too. I wonder if sorting the comments by /old would show that difference, or if instead it's just a go to line some are using.", "Yeah, it's pretty wild how few people use old reddit anymore.
