I (40M) have been married to my wife, Sarah (38F), for five years now. She has a daughter, Emma (16F), from her previous marriage. Emma has always been a bit of a challenge to connect with, but over the past few years, we\u2019ve developed a pretty good relationship. She\u2019s been struggling with her grades recently, specifically with math. Her mother and I tried to help her, but it\u2019s been a long time since we were in school, and we couldn\u2019t really provide the support she needed.\n\nSarah and I discussed hiring a tutor for Emma, but she was adamant that Emma should figure it out on her own. Sarah believes that struggling is a natural part of life, and it builds character. I agreed with her to some extent, but I also believe that there\u2019s no harm in providing a little extra support when needed.\n\nI decided to secretly hire a tutor for Emma without Sarah\u2019s knowledge. I found a great tutor, Alice (24F), who was a math major in college and had a flexible schedule. Emma and Alice have been meeting at the local library after school for the past two months, and Emma\u2019s grades have significantly improved. Emma was grateful for the help and didn\u2019t have a problem keeping it a secret from her mother.\n\nHowever, recently Sarah found out. One of her friends saw Emma and Alice at the library and mentioned it to Sarah. She confronted me, and I admitted what I had done. Sarah was furious, accusing me of undermining her parenting and going behind her back. She claims I should have respected her decision, and I\u2019ve damaged our trust.\n\nEmma, on the other hand, has been ecstatic about her improved grades and is finally feeling confident in her math skills. She\u2019s even considering taking more advanced math classes next year.

Hiring a tutor shows that you were acting in the best interest of your stepdaughter, which is a fundamental responsibility of a parent or stepparent.\n2.

Your intentions were not to undermine Sarah but to help Emma. It seems that your actions were motivated by concern for Emma's well-being rather than a desire to go against Sarah's wishes.\n5. The main issue here is the lack of communication with Sarah, which is where the conflict arises. While it's important to present a united front in parenting, it's also important to revisit and discuss decisions when they may not be serving the child's best interests.\n6. As a stepparent, you have a tricky line to walk in terms of involvement in parenting decisions. However, after five years of marriage and having built a good relationship with Emma, it's clear that you are an active and caring figure in her life, which gives you a stake in her upbringing.\n\nWhile you are not the asshole for seeking to provide Emma with the help she needed, going behind Sarah's back has caused trust issues that will need to be addressed.

You did it for got reasons, but you still went behind her back and she will focus on that half of the equation.  She put her self into a dumb situation and it backfired.

The problem is with school failure makes it worse. Everyone needs a little help with something and this proves what a great person you are", "NTA, you did what most parents would have done. All she seems to have needed is a bit of extra support and teaching which she worked with you to get. It required her to put in the effort or the tutor would have done nothing.  I think that your view on struggle is a much more realistic version than that of your wife's more so as she is still a child and therefore still in need of guidance and support more so than if she was an adult.", "NTA. Who tf tells their struggling child to figure it out?! This is something that could negatively impact her future. Education is one of the most important factors of success. Your wife is a huge AH.", "NTA as parents our job is to provide our kids the tools they need to do it themselves. A tutor is part of that. I think it\u2019s disgusting that your wife would have a problem with having a tutor. However, YTA for lying by to her and having her daughter lie to her.", "If you have to hire a tutor for your child *in secret*, that right there shows you are incompatible with your wife. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that she found out. \n\nWhy does your wife want to deprive your child of the best possible education? She\u2019s not mad about finances. It\u2019s not like Emma is only pretending to need a tutor. \n\nIf you have to go behind your spouse\u2019s back to for something like this, there\u2019s something wrong with your relationship. NTA, but Y W B T A if you don\u2019t examine this situation and reconsider your marriage.", "NTA but that's going to be a hard sell for your wife. \n\nDespite Emma being happier and doing better in school, your wife is still consumed with defending herself and not wanting to admit she was wrong. Good luck.", "NTA. You did a really nice thing. Your wife sounds like the AH in this situation. Her daughter was struggling with something that is totally fixable.", "NTA. I've got a number of examples that all say the same thing. I struggled for years with undiagnosed depression, ADHD and chronic fatigue. Meds radically changed my life for the better. Weird how much internal state can be influenced by pharmaceuticals, but I sure wasn't able to get here using other tools.\n\nMath is an extremely risky subject for a lot of people. It's so cumulative, that falling behind creates insurmountable problems. How are you supposed to keep up in trigonometry class when you're not even comfortable with algebra? You're just going to try and stuff two years of catchup in on the side when you weren't even able to do it alone while you had the time? Worse, once a person gets the idea that they're bad at math, that mental block makes it that much harder to ever succeed. There are MANY people who struggle in math, and never find their way out, but could have with the right help at the right time.\n\nI've got a background in statistics and a professional interest in AI. The whole thing is all about problem solving, and it's completely magical how the right solution can open new doors. Sometimes the right solution can be easy and fast even, and you can waste years struggling just because you didn't know the right answer. My own two cents: the whole point of school is learning problem solving skills. Even though your step daughter may not ever encounter trig problems in real life, she will absolutely encounter problems that require analytical thinking. Getting help learning to think analytically will help a lot for that future. Even more importantly, learning to use a large range of problem solving strategies is critical for surviving in the world we're finding ourselves in. Intentionally crippling yourself by cutting out arbitrary solution possibilities is (no offense to your wife) stupid. If I was against pharmaceuticals because of some misplaced belief about what was 'natural', I'd almost certainly be on disability instead of holding down a job. If I believed it was a weakness to look for insight and help on Google when I hit a roadblock, I'd waste huge amounts of time. If I thought it was weakness to hire help when I needed it, I probably wouldn't have a working kitchen sink after how things started last time I tried to fix it on my own.\n\nWe're social creatures. A HUGE part of our strength as a species is our ability to learn from others, instead of just struggling on our own. You're NTA because in my view, your step daughter's emotional and academic health takes precedence over her parent's feelings, and your wife is just objectively wrong about her feelings on this. Suffering has no intrinsic value unless you're Catholic.\n\nThat said... you did betray her trust on this. A secret tutor was one possible solution, but maybe a family mediator and professional advice to get a tutor would have worked too, I don't know. Either way, I think you brought about the right result (your step daughter is doing better in school) but because of the way you went about it, you've got some unpleasant work ahead of you in your marriage. Good luck.", "NTA \n\nWhen I was in school I struggled with math, and struggling by myself didn\u2019t achieve much except frustration and angry tears. I definitely could have used a tutor, though I would have been ashamed of it. \n\nAlso, as someone with step parents, it\u2019s great to see how much you care about her and her well being. Keep it up!", "She\u2019s a terrible parent. NTA.", "Struggling might be a natural part of life\u2026 but it\u2019s also why we need to learn to reach out and ask for help when we can\u2019t do things on our own. You taught your stepdaughter that it\u2019s okay to ask for help instead of bearing the entire burden herself. That\u2019s going to be incredibly important for her as she goes into her adult life. Good for you. \n\nYour wife however\u2026 how could she be okay watching her daughter struggle? It\u2019s literally a parents job to offer support. I can\u2019t imagine what she\u2019s thinking\u2026 a tutor is perfect for helping you learn the material in a different way than it\u2019s taught during class. Why is that a bad thing???\n\nNTA.", "I'm going to say NTA with reservations.\n\nYou shouldn't really go behind your wife's back.  \n\nHowever your wife's reasoning is absolutely batshit.   I'm not in favour of helicopter parents, but your wiife has taken the opposite to extremes.", "NTA for why you did what you did, but how you did it isn't the greatest. I can see why your wife is upset because you lied to her. On the other hand, your wife is also a problem for not seeing how this issue was affecting her daughter. The whole struggles make you stronger is something that works in regular life situations not so much in education. Struggling in learning something in a school format isn't going to make you stronger it will just make you want to quit that subject. You did a good job, and now it seems like she has a new fascination with the subject which is awesome. You should definitely get with your step daughter and sit down with your wife so yall can both talk to her about why you did what you did and let your step daughter know how it has made her feel.", "NTA.  Thank you for showing Emma that you're someone she can count on when she needs help.  All kids should have someone like that in their lives - ideally a parent, step-parent or aunt/uncle.  It's one thing to challenge your kid, but they also need to know you have their back when they need it...", "Good job. Our son needed math help early on and we got it for him. \n\nHe ran with it and started an early college program in hs, and is currently 3rd year In engineering school.", "NTA sometimes working hard means seeking help when you know you need it. It\u2019s okay to rely on others for help. I feel like you taught your stepdaughter a great lesson and it\u2019s amazing that she\u2019s now more interested in math as a result!", "NTA. I get her being upset about you going behind her back, but having to struggle in school to \"build character\" is stupid af when you have ways to remedy the situation. And clearly the tutoring has been working. Not being able to understand what you're supposed to be learning in school is NOT the same thing as \"struggling in life and building character\"", "NTA\n\nGive your wife time to cool off. Maybe have a discussion with the three of you?", "Your wife\u2019s reasonings are strange. Yes, there\u2019s struggle in life but there are also an abundance of solutions. Why continue to fail math if there\u2019s help", "Nta sarah was wrong and your step daughter needed help and support and it\u2019s a good sign she felt comfortable enough to ask for that help. \n\nIs this the type of person Sarah is though? She won\u2019t admit she was wrong so she wants to punish you and act like  your wrong for going behind her back. She needs to look at why you and her daughter had to do that", "Since Emma has worked hard and is ecstatic over her improved grades, you are NTA. Emma was struggling and you recognized it and gave her a great solution. Your wife is T A in this instance because she refused to give Emma a helping hand. And this is not the same as buying her the latest iPhone, or a car for her birthday, this is for grades and education!! Well done, Dad.", "NTA. as someone who has struggled with math my whole life, a tutor helped massively when I was in college. And I should have been getting help from a tutor a lot sooner. Having her daughter struggle in math is just mean. A parent should want to help improve their kids lives and she\u2019s just setting her daughter up for failure for whatever reason. \nShe needs a reality check and Emma should continue to see the tutor.", "NTA. She was already struggling. She needed help. You gave her help. You don\u2019t let someone who is struggling to swim just fucking drown. You help them. Her mom is weird.", "NTA \"Learn by struggling\" Yeah, that's like teaching a kid to swim by pushing them off the dock. It's freaking cruel. Tutoring is like training wheels on a bike - support to give them confidence to learn on their own.", "NTA- the question is, why is your wife setting her daughter up to fail? The kid needed extra support to understand math, what is the problem. There is enough struggles in the world that kid will have to deal with, but she\u2019ll be an adult and will come up with solutions to these challenges. Your wife sounds like AH.", "Yep. Speaking as someone who's independent to a maladaptive degree, asking for help when it's appropriate is an important skill that Sarah is actively preventing Emma from developing.", "Some people consider requiring the help of others as a sign of weakness and failure", "Except Emma did make the decision - Sarah wanted Emma to struggle alone.\nNta OP.", "Emma obviously made the decision to see the tutor though?", "lol what a garbage take. Thanks for the laugh", "Kids do have to learn how to struggle but they should struggle with manageable challenges. The keyword is manageable. It should not undermine their confidence. Instead it builds their confidence and makes them feel capable. That is not what was happening with your stepdaughter. It is appropriate to get her a tutor. Especially since it\u2019s making her want to challenge herself more.", "Emma is learning that she CAN overcome her struggles with help and effort. That's a good lesson.", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have gone behind your wife\u2019s back but she also shouldn\u2019t have been so dismissive of her daughter\u2019s needs that you had to. Struggling is a part of life but there\u2019s enough struggling in life to begin with that you don\u2019t need to manufacture it by denying support when it\u2019s needed. High school is exactly when this kind of support should be offered because you\u2019re still a kid and still learning how to function. High school is for learning and if you need help to do that you should get it if it\u2019s available. I\u2019m glad you had your step daughter\u2019s back and cared enough to do what was right for her.", "One has a feeling that when Emma makes valedictorian, it ain't going to be your wife she thanks in her speech...", "NTA.  So your wife would rather her kid fail, instead of getting help and actually learning?  How long was she supposed to struggle for?  Until she fails, what if she never just got it.  You did the right thing, you helped a child.", "Seriously, it\u2019s so hard for me to ask for help and even when I manage to im riddled with anxiety about it. \n\nLearning at a young age how and when to ask for help is so fucking important.", "Me as well. My first thought upon reading this was that teaching Emma that it's okay to ask for help is really valuable as well. It's something I too wish I was better at.", "True, but where does that belief stem from? Does that belief do more harm or good? As is that belief universal? Is it still a sign of weakness if the old woman asks for help lifting something heavy? The foreigner who looks lost? The child who can't reach the shelf or the man whose car died and needs a jump? If some of those examples are acceptable, but others aren't, then the person who believes that needs to to start asking themselves why.", "Right! I'm 53 and my brain just doesn't deal with numbers. I cried real tears of relief and joy the day I found an app to deal with the checkbook.\n\nOn a weird side note, I had absolutely no problems with music, not even music theory in college, but basic addition and subtraction instantly shuts down my entire brain.", "You're very wise and I bet any children in your life benefit from it. \n\nIf I'd had more understanding adults like you in my corner, my grades prior to college would've been much better and I wouldn't have had to drown so much in college .", "I'm sorry you had to go through this. Far too many adults in the world think that because they struggled and \"turned out fine\" and so that's just the way of things. \n\nIt's not. We do not have to live like this, forcing our children to suffer because we suffered is not okay.", "Thank you. I am sorry you didn\u2019t have that. I teach education and that is what I tell my teacher students. They need to know their students and where they are at developmentally to challenge them but not overwhelm them."]}
