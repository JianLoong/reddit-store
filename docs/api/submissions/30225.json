I (40M) have been married to my wife, Sarah (38F), for five years now. She has a daughter, Emma (16F), from her previous marriage. Emma has always been a bit of a challenge to connect with, but over the past few years, we\u2019ve developed a pretty good relationship. She\u2019s been struggling with her grades recently, specifically with math. Her mother and I tried to help her, but it\u2019s been a long time since we were in school, and we couldn\u2019t really provide the support she needed.\n\nSarah and I discussed hiring a tutor for Emma, but she was adamant that Emma should figure it out on her own. Sarah believes that struggling is a natural part of life, and it builds character. I agreed with her to some extent, but I also believe that there\u2019s no harm in providing a little extra support when needed.\n\nI decided to secretly hire a tutor for Emma without Sarah\u2019s knowledge. I found a great tutor, Alice (24F), who was a math major in college and had a flexible schedule. Emma and Alice have been meeting at the local library after school for the past two months, and Emma\u2019s grades have significantly improved. Emma was grateful for the help and didn\u2019t have a problem keeping it a secret from her mother.\n\nHowever, recently Sarah found out. One of her friends saw Emma and Alice at the library and mentioned it to Sarah. She confronted me, and I admitted what I had done. Sarah was furious, accusing me of undermining her parenting and going behind her back. She claims I should have respected her decision, and I\u2019ve damaged our trust.\n\nEmma, on the other hand, has been ecstatic about her improved grades and is finally feeling confident in her math skills. She\u2019s even considering taking more advanced math classes next year. I feel like I did the right thing for Emma, but I understand why Sarah is upset.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for secretly hiring a tutor for my stepdaughter?", "created_utc": 1699003795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mr5mk/aita_for_secretly_hiring_a_tutor_for_my/", "score": 627, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hiring a tutor shows that you were acting in the best interest of your stepdaughter, which is a fundamental responsibility of a parent or stepparent.\n2.

Your intentions were not to undermine Sarah but to help Emma. It seems that your actions were motivated by concern for Emma's well-being rather than a desire to go against Sarah's wishes.\n5. The main issue here is the lack of communication with Sarah, which is where the conflict arises. While it's important to present a united front in parenting, it's also important to revisit and discuss decisions when they may not be serving the child's best interests.\n6. As a stepparent, you have a tricky line to walk in terms of involvement in parenting decisions. However, after five years of marriage and having built a good relationship with Emma, it's clear that you are an active and caring figure in her life, which gives you a stake in her upbringing.\n\nWhile you are not the asshole for seeking to provide Emma with the help she needed, going behind Sarah's back has caused trust issues that will need to be addressed.

You did it for got reasons, but you still went behind her back and she will focus on that half of the equation.  She put her self into a dumb situation and it backfired.

It's so cumulative, that falling behind creates insurmountable problems. How are you supposed to keep up in trigonometry class when you're not even comfortable with algebra? You're just going to try and stuff two years of catchup in on the side when you weren't even able to do it alone while you had the time?

The whole thing is all about problem solving, and it's completely magical how the right solution can open new doors. Sometimes the right solution can be easy and fast even, and you can waste years struggling just because you didn't know the right answer. My own two cents: the whole point of school is learning problem solving skills. Even though your step daughter may not ever encounter trig problems in real life, she will absolutely encounter problems that require analytical thinking. Getting help learning to think analytically will help a lot for that future. Even more importantly, learning to use a large range of problem solving strategies is critical for surviving in the world we're finding ourselves in. Intentionally crippling yourself by cutting out arbitrary solution possibilities is (no offense to your wife) stupid. If I was against pharmaceuticals because of some misplaced belief about what was 'natural', I'd almost certainly be on disability instead of holding down a job. If I believed it was a weakness to look for insight and help on Google when I hit a roadblock, I'd waste huge amounts of time. If I thought it was weakness to hire help when I needed it, I probably wouldn't have a working kitchen sink after how things started last time I tried to fix it on my own.\n\nWe're social creatures.

But the whole, stepdaughter needs to struggle approach is objectively wrong and it\u2019s quite likely that there will be future instances when stepdaughter will need support from BOTH of you. So it\u2019s best to address this sooner rather than later. \n\nIn the end, your wife needs to apologize and explain why she is wrong to her daughter, or she may take the wrong message from this situation. She has struggled. And you\u2019ve shown her that it\u2019s good to ask for help and use the resources that are available to her. \n\nEdited: clarifications", "You are a good Dad.", "There is no inherent value in struggle just for struggle\u2019s sake \u2014 I say this as someone with an advanced degree who has spent a lot of my life studying. What your stepdaughter needs to learn is hard work, perseverance, and grit. These skills are the building blocks of success. Struggle by itself is not. She\u2019s putting in the hard work studying and learning the material with the tutor. Not only is the tutor teaching math but probably also study skills which will serve her well in the future. She\u2019s also learning that even if you have a hard time with a subject, you can overcome that and improve. And succeeding in an area that was initially difficult builds up her sense of self worth and efficacy. Her mom is wrong and you\u2019re doing exactly the right thing for your stepdaughter.", "Nta big time. I wish I had support like that when I was younger. Before I moved to a small town I had B\u2019s in my math and when I moved it went straight it a F or barely passing. The saddest part was that I was ahead of everyone with multiplication/division on fractions in the 6th grade. Idk what sort of teaching it was but I was lost. I can\u2019t stand math now and I\u2019m 31 and when I went back to college to gauge where I was for algebra I did a lot better than I had anticipated cuz I had a professor who was explaining it well. \n\nMind you during my junior high and HS we kept changing math teachers so i never found that click except for one teacher who was having us do longer problems but it finally clicked. My junior/senior year I was extremely lucky to have a teacher who didn\u2019t quit and he worked hard with me. I still feel im almost there but popping that bubble is still there. I personally think you\u2019re doing great and for your wife tho? She was like my teachers and parents that kept telling figure it out on your it\u2019s like what do you think I\u2019m trying to do?!?", "It was absolutely not your fault, you supported your stepchild to a degree, I haven't heard before on Reddit and I think that's really sweet of you. If I didn't know any better, I would say you were the dad and your wife was the stepmother.\n\nNTA", "In the original discussion, when Mum said no.  Emma should have had the opportunity to have the choice then to make the decision.", "In the original discussion, when Mum said no.  Emma should have had the opportunity to have the choice then to make the decision.", "Part of struggling is learning when to ask for help", "Also, in my experience, a good tutor helps you to figure out problems on your own. It helped to open up different ways of assessing and handling problems.", "Exactly. Not letting her struggle would be paying the teacher to give her an A. \n\nShe obviously still struggled with the material. It was hard but she persevered and struggled until she learned it.", "I mean the girl had struggled, then put in the extra work required to fix the situation. I'm proud of her.\n\nI understand Moms anger at going behind her back but think she  just picked the wrong battle. Mom should have been open to the tutor if kiddo was willing to work at it. hopefully she'll calm and see how her daughter worked for the better grades and there is no shame in asking for help.", "Seriously, one of the most infuriating things as an adult is being around another adult who doesn't know what they're doing but then refuses your help, or anyone else's, when you try to correct them. \n\nIt usually means that nothing gets done well or on time.", "Wife is likely someone who is good at teaching herself things or is someone who was expected (likely with harsh consequences for \"bothering\" the adults) to do things without help from a young age. Either you get good at it, you figure out a way that works for you (that isn't the correct or safe way of doing it), or you continually make a mess of it until you can quit doing it (often getting in trouble for not being able to figure out how it works).", "Yeah. Though sometimes you just need someone to tell you \"you have to at least try this\" because you also don't want Emma to feel like she has to go along with mom's pick.  So I'm glad she has OP in their corner for a second opinion sometimes.", "Mine is kinda the opposite. I got to drop math after middle school due to not being able to grasp basic addition/subtraction without a calculator, much less algebra; no one was in my corner and I felt too stupid to go to college hence why I joined the Corps. \n\nI finally enrolled in community college this last summer and was tested for dyscalculia after my advisor noticed the missing math credits.", "Omg I am all aboard the train you\u2019re in. I cannot imagine as a parent to be mad at a co parent for helping my children succeed. What a hill to die on. NTA!", "NTA.   If this instance, you are doing something that your stepdaughter really needed help with.    Your wife is being too hard on her daughter, in this instance.", "NTA-my kid was in the exact same boat as your kid. A tutor helped so much with her confidence!", "NTA.  Tell your wife her bad attitude is going to make her struggle to have a good relationship with her daughter.  Then tell her she deserves to struggle because she thinks others should when there are logical solutions to their problems. Tell her if she had been logical and got her a tutor, she wouldn\u2019t have to struggle to have a good relationship with her daughter.  Then laugh like a madman.", "the tutoring was a gift that you paid for with your own money, that your stepdaughter wanted and benefited from. You shouldn't have kept this from her mother or done so against her wishes, yet I can't sympathize with her opinion that her daughter should just be thrown to the dogs. That feels neglectful.", "What is up with this mother ???", "NTA. You chose to help a child in your care. You did the right thing. Perhaps you should have told Sarah but you still did the right thing.", "NTA. While struggling may be a part of life, if you are able to help your children NOT struggle in certain areas, \ud83d\udde3IT IS YOUR JOB TO DO SO. Your wife is out of her mind if she thinks letting her daughter sink for the sake of it was worth it. Good job stepdad. Next time, you just need to tell her you\u2019re doing this to benefit the kid whether she likes it or not", "NTA. Life has enough of its own natural struggle without needlessly adding more. \n\nThis is excellent step parenting", "NTA\n\nYou know I wrote out my story about how my parents let me struggle too instead of finding me a tutor, who could explain things in a way I could grasp it, and how it changed the entire trajectory of my life, but it doesn't really matter.\n\nIt doesn't, because just think about it. *What sort of parent wants their child to struggle instead of flourishing?*\n\nAnd I don't mean give them anything they want, no.  There is a difference between giving them everything on a silver platter and *giving them the tools to work out how to get what they want.*\n\nSure, you can hope someone will eventually work out how to fish on their own... or you can just teach them as soon as possible, and make sure they don't starve.\n\nYou sound like an amazing stepdad. Keep up the good work!", "This says everything I wanted to say much more succinctly. \n\nThe only potentially AH thing OP did was going behind OP's wife's back, but since OP did so for the express purpose of providing valuable, necessary, and TOTALLY WANTED AND APPRECIATED help for a child under OP's care, and because they had already discussed it and wife's reasoning made zero sense and would likely be damaging to the child in the long run (beyond a bad grade in math), definitely NTA.", "I really struggled with long division/multiplication at school.  I finally mentioned this to my mum, who showed me the way she was taught it that it finally clicked for me.\n\nI think nowadays schools are too fixed on teaching one way.  I think it\u2019s mostly because of it makes it easier to write/mark SATs tests.", "The truth is if math is hard for her a tutor does not cure that, it just provides someone that can spend the time and try different explanations that might help her understand the process.  She will still have to work at it.", "You are a great stepdad.\n\nMy parents had the money, but let me struggle anyway. My cousin also struggled, but her parents got her an amazing tutor, and she soared.\n\nI'll forever advocate for having a good tutor who can help you connect the dots.\n\nYou rock!", "Really, with the decline in math skills over the past two years, especially during COVID, I think most every student could benefit from a math tutor.", "Emma is very lucky to have OP and to orgainise it."]}
