{"id": 30225, "submission_id": "17mr5mk", "title": "AITA for secretly hiring a tutor for my stepdaughter?", "selftext": "So, a bit of context. I (40M) have been married to my wife, Sarah (38F), for five years now. She has a daughter, Emma (16F), from her previous marriage. Emma has always been a bit of a challenge to connect with, but over the past few years, we\u2019ve developed a pretty good relationship. She\u2019s been struggling with her grades recently, specifically with math. Her mother and I tried to help her, but it\u2019s been a long time since we were in school, and we couldn\u2019t really provide the support she needed.\n\nSarah and I discussed hiring a tutor for Emma, but she was adamant that Emma should figure it out on her own. Sarah believes that struggling is a natural part of life, and it builds character. I agreed with her to some extent, but I also believe that there\u2019s no harm in providing a little extra support when needed.\n\nI decided to secretly hire a tutor for Emma without Sarah\u2019s knowledge. I found a great tutor, Alice (24F), who was a math major in college and had a flexible schedule. Emma and Alice have been meeting at the local library after school for the past two months, and Emma\u2019s grades have significantly improved. Emma was grateful for the help and didn\u2019t have a problem keeping it a secret from her mother.\n\nHowever, recently Sarah found out. One of her friends saw Emma and Alice at the library and mentioned it to Sarah. She confronted me, and I admitted what I had done. Sarah was furious, accusing me of undermining her parenting and going behind her back. She claims I should have respected her decision, and I\u2019ve damaged our trust.\n\nEmma, on the other hand, has been ecstatic about her improved grades and is finally feeling confident in her math skills. She\u2019s even considering taking more advanced math classes next year. I feel like I did the right thing for Emma, but I understand why Sarah is upset.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for secretly hiring a tutor for my stepdaughter?", "created_utc": 1699003795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mr5mk/aita_for_secretly_hiring_a_tutor_for_my/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why needlessly struggle when you don't need to. Is life too easy for Emma right now or something? Your wife thinks she's not having to jump through enough hoops? You're both her parents.

Sharpen skillsets (like math) so they're better prepared when opportunities come their way? \n\nNah. Maybe you could be called the bum head for being sneaky about it, but it sounds like Sarah would have said no either way. And you put Emma's needs above your wife's weird life philosophy that to struggle needlessly is necessary.

My parents got me a tutor and it really did work wonders for me. I just needed someone to explain to me at my own pace. I started loving math after that and would feel such validation when I started acing the tests. \n\nSometimes people just need a little bit of extra help and you provided that so that seems like good parenting to me. I don't understand your wife's view on the subject at all and I disagree with it completely.", "NTA. I guess I can understand some parents belief that kids need to figure things out on their own.. but school is something that could possibly have lasting affects for her future.

That is bad parenting.\n\n\u201cYeah I don\u2019t want to give my kid the best start in life because it builds character.\u201d\n\nAs someone who really struggled in school, it was not character building, it was crushing and embarrassing and gave me huge self-esteem issues.\n\nTurns out that I have dyscalculia and just needed things explaining differently. My life would have been so much less stressful and confusing if someone had tried to help, rather than just giving up on me where maths is concerned.\n\nAbsolutely not an AH for helping a struggling kid. Usually I wouldn\u2019t back lying but seeing as she actively vetoed this for frankly absurd reasons, I can\u2019t see her suddenly allowing it.

You're not undermining her parenting, you're just giving it a little push...", "NTA", "This should have been discussed with Emma, all three of you together.  Emma should have been the one to make the decision.\n\nMe - I struggled all the way through school with maths, if I were given the option for a tutor, I would have jumped at the chance. I went to my maths teacher for help once and her attitude was very similar to your wife's.  She told me to figure it out on my own.  To this day, decades later, I still feel like a failure and disheartened because I didn't ever work it out on my own.", "NTA.  It's one thing to let a kid struggle with everyday social issues and other life problems.  But it's another to allow them to fail academically, especially in the hyper competitive educational world in which we live.  Doing well in math can only open doors for your step daughter.  Her mother needs to become more nuanced in those things where she allows her daughter to struggle and those where she gets help for her.", "NTA. Sarah is an idiot, Life is all about continual learning and improvement.

That mentality of letting kids \"figure it out on their own\" can cause huuuuge problems for children's self esteem esp teenagers. Sometimes teachers methods esp for math don't gel with a students or they don't have the time to allow other students to get concepts before moving on coz KPI's.\n\nYou definitely did the right thing.", "NTA. No disrespect but your wife is absolutely ridiculous. What nonsense is that? Yes we all struggle at some point in life but if there is the means to garner assistance, why not take it. Clearly, your daughter just needed someone to guide her and in doing so she is succeeding in overcoming her challenges. Good on you for recognizing that and getting her the help that she needs, I\u2019m sure she will always appreciate that.", "NTA", "NTA, it's true that life is sometimes a struggle, but that's why you have people who have your back.
