She says Heidi has been really pushing for it, especially because I live really close to NYC and she wants to see more of the art scene. I've been trying to politely avoid the subject and have just said that she's too young, but they won't let it go. Now they're throwing in my face that I didn't think my other sister, Dawn, was too young when I was taking her for summers, and she was almost a year younger when that started.\n\nI don't see it the same way. Yes, Dawn was almost a year younger when I was taking her for entire summers, but it was a completely different situation. For one, when she was 15, I was 19. When Heidi was BORN, I was 22. Dawn is and was my peer, not someone that could easily be my child. Two, the situation was completely different. I was taking her for entire summers because unlike Heidi, Dawn and I didn't really *have* parents. We had a stepdad who demanded that we be as invisible as possible (different guy) and a mom who completely on board with that, which meant that the entire expectations around it were different. Also, as much as I don't want to act like 2004 was a different world, it kind of was, and there were specific subculture things that made it even more of a different situation. Three, maybe because of who we are, maybe because of the world and what was happening at home, but Dawn at 15 was so much more independent and self-possessed than Heidi is at 16. Dawn was running around the country with paper maps, a flip phone and dreams with no issues. I saw Heidi stutter trying to order at McDonald's two months ago. \n\nDawn didn't spend her life expecting me to hold her hand through so much as the mall while mommy and daddy called me every two hours to check in. We were peers who could still both live our lives and just hang out, and it didn't come with extra intrusions. So yeah, I was a lot more okay with having Dawn with me for summers when I was in college and now don't even want Heidi coming to visit me alone for even a week. I'd like it to be different, but it's just not the same thing. \n\nNow my mom is mad at me for treating my sisters differently. She's crying that I don't love Heidi the same as Dawn, that I'm not giving them equal opportunities and punishing her for not being born earlier. I don't think I'm in the wrong here.

Not saying that to be mean saying it because as you mentioned you and Dawn were plug and play at a young age while Heidi is stuttering for a big Mac. Your mom and step dad seem to like that old schedule but they have a kid in 3 years if they don't start letting go and teaching her how to survive she's gonna fall flat on her face. New York City is not the place to send a kid who's not street savvy. So until she's suburb savvy the worst thing you could do is take her for the summer. NTA.", "NTA! You're mother is seriously delusional! Just how do people erase years of their lives, and expect you to do so as well?! It baffles me! Tell her the truth. Quit sugar coating it. Not going to make it any better avoiding the subject. Also, why can't she spend the summer with her sister?! Makes more sense to me. Especially with the age gap!", "NTA. There is a big difference on how you treat siblings that are a different generation than you. I have two younger brothers. One is 5 years younger. The other is old enough to be my son. I was raised with the older one and the other I was not around much. Your relationship with your sisters is totally different. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault but it\u2019s just different. Your mom sounds like she doesn\u2019t like to parent much once her kids get older. Your mom is the AH most of all especially for making you pretend you were invisible in front of her ex. She needs to take of our own kid and not pawn her off on you.", "OP should absolutely not show her mom this. Her mom is definitely going to notice and the parts:\n\n>I saw Heidi stutter trying to order at McDonald's two months ago. \n\n>Dawn didn't spend her life expecting me to hold her hand through so much as the mall while mommy and daddy called me every two hours to check in.\n\nThat talk about Heidi in a way that's pretty mean and uncalled for. And then that's what the argument's gonna be about.\n\nShe should focus on the stuff you mentioned, possibly keeping stuff like, \"Mom I took Dawn in for entire summers so she could have a break from you and stepdad,\" and, \"I thought Dawn was old enough at 15 because I knew she'd had to be her own parent,\" in reserve if she's up to fighting about that.", ">Is Heidi looking for an out?\n\nHard to say when Heidi isn't even making the ask.  Her mother is doing it.  I mean, Heidi *might* be, but...", "Yep, I was going to say it doesn't sound like mom was just following stepdad's lead as much as OP thought.", "Fair call and thanks for calling me in on that.", "Perfect summary.", "Pure insanity", "Because of how her parents raised her. She hasn't been given safe opportunities to be independent so she doesn't know how.", "That\u2019s the point. She didn\u2019t need to do that with Dawn. If  Heidi was more mature and independent then maybe OP would be open to it.", "If that were the case, then Heidi needs to contact OP herself and explain instead of letting her mom do it.", "Honestly you've convinced me. I think OP resents her sister for reasons that are the fault of her mom and its not fair. It's fine to not want to do all this stuff with a 16 year old, I get it, but seriously, not drinking with her when she's 21 because she still \"sees her as a kid\"? How does OP know what she will be like.\n\nOP it feels like you are punishing your sister who seems like she wants to get to know you.", "I'm 66, and I refuse to go into NYC with the way things are run now.  I used to go there often seeing plays, concerts and going to museums.  It's just a short train ride away..but now.  Fugeddaboutit (as we say in Jersey)", "I know its possible but it shouldn't be happening was my point. I wasnt nitpicking i was pointing out that i dont think she even knows how old her sister is. Good thing she  is a lesbian or the sister would be a baby aunt. Probably younger based on this families history."]}
