She says Heidi has been really pushing for it, especially because I live really close to NYC and she wants to see more of the art scene. I've been trying to politely avoid the subject and have just said that she's too young, but they won't let it go. Now they're throwing in my face that I didn't think my other sister, Dawn, was too young when I was taking her for summers, and she was almost a year younger when that started.\n\nI don't see it the same way. Yes, Dawn was almost a year younger when I was taking her for entire summers, but it was a completely different situation. For one, when she was 15, I was 19. When Heidi was BORN, I was 22. Dawn is and was my peer, not someone that could easily be my child. Two, the situation was completely different. I was taking her for entire summers because unlike Heidi, Dawn and I didn't really *have* parents. We had a stepdad who demanded that we be as invisible as possible (different guy) and a mom who completely on board with that, which meant that the entire expectations around it were different. Also, as much as I don't want to act like 2004 was a different world, it kind of was, and there were specific subculture things that made it even more of a different situation. Three, maybe because of who we are, maybe because of the world and what was happening at home, but Dawn at 15 was so much more independent and self-possessed than Heidi is at 16. Dawn was running around the country with paper maps, a flip phone and dreams with no issues. I saw Heidi stutter trying to order at McDonald's two months ago. \n\nDawn didn't spend her life expecting me to hold her hand through so much as the mall while mommy and daddy called me every two hours to check in. We were peers who could still both live our lives and just hang out, and it didn't come with extra intrusions. So yeah, I was a lot more okay with having Dawn with me for summers when I was in college and now don't even want Heidi coming to visit me alone for even a week. I'd like it to be different, but it's just not the same thing. \n\nNow my mom is mad at me for treating my sisters differently. She's crying that I don't love Heidi the same as Dawn, that I'm not giving them equal opportunities and punishing her for not being born earlier. I don't think I'm in the wrong here.

Heidi has done nothing wrong here.", "I mean it did give Dawn opportunity to see and do things and meet people that she otherwise wouldn't have otherwise especially not at her ages. \n\nI was in college in NYC in what used to be a very specific subculture, so there were unique social opportunities and the freedom we had offered even more. Thing is, even if the scenes hadn't changed, I didn't change and I thought it was appropriate or her parents would, I can't replicate that for her because I wasn't introducing it as learning from adults for the future. She'd need to have a level of maturity that she doesn't have.", "Right? You can feel the hate for Heidi in every comment.
