{"id": 30030, "submission_id": "17kev78", "title": "AITA for letting one of my sisters live with me and not even letting the other one visit?", "selftext": "My mom has been pressuring me (37f) lately to have my younger sister, Heidi (16f) visit my wife and I. She says Heidi has been really pushing for it, especially because I live really close to NYC and she wants to see more of the art scene. I've been trying to politely avoid the subject and have just said that she's too young, but they won't let it go. Now they're throwing in my face that I didn't think my other sister, Dawn, was too young when I was taking her for summers, and she was almost a year younger when that started.\n\nI don't see it the same way. Yes, Dawn was almost a year younger when I was taking her for entire summers, but it was a completely different situation. For one, when she was 15, I was 19. When Heidi was BORN, I was 22. Dawn is and was my peer, not someone that could easily be my child. Two, the situation was completely different. I was taking her for entire summers because unlike Heidi, Dawn and I didn't really *have* parents. We had a stepdad who demanded that we be as invisible as possible (different guy) and a mom who completely on board with that, which meant that the entire expectations around it were different. Also, as much as I don't want to act like 2004 was a different world, it kind of was, and there were specific subculture things that made it even more of a different situation. Three, maybe because of who we are, maybe because of the world and what was happening at home, but Dawn at 15 was so much more independent and self-possessed than Heidi is at 16. Dawn was running around the country with paper maps, a flip phone and dreams with no issues. I saw Heidi stutter trying to order at McDonald's two months ago. \n\nDawn didn't spend her life expecting me to hold her hand through so much as the mall while mommy and daddy called me every two hours to check in. We were peers who could still both live our lives and just hang out, and it didn't come with extra intrusions. So yeah, I was a lot more okay with having Dawn with me for summers when I was in college and now don't even want Heidi coming to visit me alone for even a week. I'd like it to be different, but it's just not the same thing. \n\nNow my mom is mad at me for treating my sisters differently. She's crying that I don't love Heidi the same as Dawn, that I'm not giving them equal opportunities and punishing her for not being born earlier. I don't think I'm in the wrong here. I think that the time has just passed and unfortunately we are just going to have a different relationship.", "created_utc": 1698734553, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kev78/aita_for_letting_one_of_my_sisters_live_with_me/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019ve changed, you\u2019re at a different stage of life now (you\u2019ve lived almost twice as long now!), and you don\u2019t have the same relationship with Heidi that you had/have with Dawn. Your mother can\u2019t compare the two.\n\nPerhaps your mother is in desperate need of a break and had already promised this to Heidi, and frustration got the best of her. But it\u2019s still not okay for her to guilt you or be mad at you.", "NTA. This is your choice. Your mother sounds to have made far worse choices that had a huge impact on you.\n\n>We had a stepdad who demanded that we be as invisible as possible (different guy) and a mom who completely on board with that\n\nDoes she want to discuss that?", "NTA.    Regardless of how each sister is capable or not capable.   There is a massive age difference between you. Her interests ate very unlikely to coincide with yours.", "NTA the relationships are completely different. You would be baby sitting a 16yr old. That\u2019s not fun. If she wants to see New York have her parents take her on vacation.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to love your siblings differently, it\u2019s only parents that are supposed to love their children equally.\n\nThe experience of a contemporary sibling and the relationship out of that joint growing up together experience is always going to be different than a large age gap sibling.\n\nYour mom is wrong for being upset about this and as long as you do actually love your much younger sibling she has no valid reason to make it a point of contention that you have a different relationship with her.\n\nAs for your argument that your sister was more independent, that\u2019s probably a motivating factor in your mother\u2019s pushing for you to take her for extended visits. She\u2019s tired of the intensive parenting this kid requires. Still, not your problem.", "NTA.  You and Dawn are peers.  You would be expected to parent Heidi through sheer fact of the age difference.", "NTA but uh, you've really come down hard on Heidi here and I don't think she deserves it. Don't take her for the break, by all means, but don't judge her for being more timid than your sister. You make fun of her stuttering, for pity's sake. I can almost guarantee that her homelife isn't great, even if it's neglectful in a different way. 'Mommy's and daddy' calling every two hours sounds suffocating. \n\nYour mum is the issue here. You don't have to treat Heidi the same, you don't have to love her the same (sad though that is), just be kind.", "NTA.\n\nLiving close to NYC is not the same as living in NYC. If your sister is nervous at McDonalds, she will certain be super nervous taking public transportation from wherever you are to the so called \"art scene\". If they thought that \"of course you would drop everything to take your sister into NYC every day and spend the day with her there\", then this is a very big ask if it is more than a day or two.", "You have different relationships with your sisters and that's not unusual. You and Dawn were 4 years apart in age and grew up together - it sounds like you had already left home before Heidi was born, so she is more like a niece or cousin that a sister.\n\nI don't think you are the AH for having different relationships with them, but  is there not some middle ground between having Heidi to visit for an entire summer, and letting her visit for short periods. \n\nHave you actually talked to Heidi about what she wants? She's grown up in a time where (most) parents are much more (over) protective nd kids don't get the same opportunities to learn independence.\n\nMaybe suggest that Heidi comes for a weekend with a specific event or activity in mind, and talk to her about how much of that time you and your wife can be with her - if she isn't used to a big city that might involve agreeing to travel with her to the location / event she wants to visit, arrange a time and place to meet up and let her have an emergency number. \n\nYour mom is being unreasonable, but equally, you do seem to be completely closed to spending any time with Heidi - would it really be impossible to host her for a day or two, show her some sights, and get to know her a bit better than you have had the opportunity to so far?", "NTA- But you are really hard on Heidi. She didn't have to grow up as fast as you and has parents and a shy personality. That isn't her fault and you don't need to be so judmental about It. I Hope your mom takes time and takes her herself to see the ART, she seems like a Nice girl!", "NTA but hear me out. Heidi needs you more than Dawn. Dawn had a personality and a level of independence that most likely came from having you to lean on and look up to during those invisible years. Heidi has grown up in the over protective environment that can come from having older parents and siblings. Your mom is trying to pawn Heidi\u2019s adolescent development off onto you, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing. Heidi could stay and either learn to express herself or realize NYC isn\u2019t for her. You don\u2019t have to hold anyone\u2019s hand and for her that could open up a completely different side of her as a person\u2026 or she complains for a week and bails back home.", "What reality does your mom in that she thinks the child she had when you were already an adult would in any way have the same relationship with you as the sister you grew up beside?   \nNTA", "NTA.\n\nBut.\n\nDo they live close enough that a shorter visit, like a weekend - just a day out in the city, sleep over, head home next day - might be feasible? Maybe she is so immature bc your mom is suffocating her. Tell her she needs to plan (find a museum exhibition she is interested in, figure out how you all would get there from home, look up restaurants near by and make suggestions then reserve whatever you approve) a city day, and see what she comes up with. If she was just expecting you to drag her around you dodged a bullet. If she comes back with a whole plan it might be worth a try.", "NTA I think you would be TA if you did not allow Heidi to come for a couple of weekends to \u201ctaste\u201d NY. However you are under absolutely no obligation to have someone live with you for 3 months.", "NTA. But please dish what happened at McDonald's, lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And \"no\" is a complete sentence.", "NTA  if you are uncomfortable and she is too immature.  Having said that, if you'd like to build a relationship directly with her at some point without the parents interference, you could wait until she is 18.   It can be fun to show someone around.  Sounds like she would enjoy the art museums and a show.  She might be a nice person.", "Exactly,  OP stated her case logically and not with an emotional justification.  She has a very good argument.  Times change.", "Exactly! Mom doesn\u2019t have any room to criticize.", "We've discussed it. She's apologized, and Dawn and I have made peace with her about it.", "I was going to say ESH for this exact reason. Like yeah, sure, all your reasoning for Dawn & Heidi being different/different scenarios makes complete sense. But Heidi can\u2019t come for a single summer week? What about a long weekend? I get it\u2019s not the same but the way you write about her, dang. Maybe your guidance for 3-5 days would help her along in independence & confidence! Just a thought!", "He didn't make fun of her.

I wasn't a parent to her and she wouldn't have let me be one if I'd tried.", "It still wouldn't be the same. I wouldn't be comfortable drinking with her in a bar even if she was 21. She feels like a little kid to me.", "Sadly, I suspect logic is not going to work with the mom. She was an inadequate parent for OP and Dawn, and it seems like she's trying to make up for it with Heidi, by being inadequate in different ways.", "I'm sure it didn't,  it sounds like you were both independent but leaving you in charge of a younger teenager when you are still a teenager is Parentification. Your mother is using you and you don't owe her anything.", "No it won't be the same as a peer, and that is ok.  I have grown nieces - they aren't my peers but they are cool people and I enjoyed building that relationship in their teens and 20s.  She's a little sister so yes you will be the adult in the relationship until she is older.  You don't have to drink in a bar with an older teen year but you can go for dinner and musical.  Get to know them where they are at.  She also has to adjust to you.  Totally up to you if you want that relationship, of course. Just food for thought."]}
