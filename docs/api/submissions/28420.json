We were also flatmates for a few years. I was much closer to Paige and my relationship with Karl could be, at best, described as a distant friend.\r  \n\r  \nLast year, when I was on a dating app, I happened to come across Karl's profile stating that he was looking for something casual. His profile was fairly detailed and consistent with what I know of him. After some contemplation, I decided to share this information with Paige. I told her that I was unaware of their marriage dynamic and was in no way judging, but I did feel she should know that this information is out there.\r  \n\r  \nPaige told me that it was a case of impersonation and that they planned to file a complaint with the cyber crime cell. She also mentioned that I should never bring this up with Karl, and that she would not tell him how she got this information. I agreed, and we left the matters at that.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, since this incident, things have changed quite a bit. Karl has stopped all forms of communication entirely. I am not invited to their house for any celebrations or gatherings (previously I was invited frequently). When I invite them both, Karl has declined the invite (through Paige) every single time. Karl has not acknowledged any gifts I have given him lately.\r  \n\r  \nRecently,  I decided to have an open conversation with Paige. I told her that I felt that the group dynamic had shifted quite noticeably. I also asked if it had anything to do with the dating profile. I requested clarity on the situation to help me draw my own boundaries.\r  \n\r  \nThis is what Paige had to say:\r  \n\r  \n*Karl still doesn't know her source of information about the dating app, and that I shouldn't ever bring this up with him (I wasn't planning to).*\r  \n\r  \n*Me never being invited to their home or for any plans even with our common friends for over a year (even though I live 20 minutes away) is just a matter of chance.*\r  \n\r  \n*She wants all of Karl's interaction with me to happen via her because she wants it like that (she said so explicitly)*\r  \n\r  \n*I shouldn't create a fuss and that it shouldn't matter to me if someone doesn't like me (while also simultaneously saying that if Karl didn't like me, she wouldn't tell me because that's private between them).*\r  \n\r  \n*I should take whatever response Karl gives me \"in my stride\"*\r  \n\r  \n*I should invite Karl to my wedding but not directly and the invite must be through G and that I shouldn't worry if he refuses to attend.*\r  \n\r  \n*I should expected Karl to not attend, but if he does then I should treat it like a 'pleasant surprise'*\r  \n\r  \nThis whole situation has become uncomfortable for me and I am now contemplating not inviting them both to my wedding.\r  \n\r  \nWIBTA for not inviting my closest friend and her husband to my wedding?", "created_utc": 1696690880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1728fjn/wibta_for_not_inviting_my_closest_friend_and_her/", "score": 1793, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What I think is you caught Karl trying to or in the process of cheating and were being a good friend by telling Paige. Paige has made her choice to stay with Karl. I get the feeling he knows it was you, despite Paige\u2019s claim of not revealing her source, because he probably saw your profile on the site around the same time he got caught. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t invite either of these people. There are way too many conditions on your relationship with them and it\u2019s setting you up to fail.", "She's no longer your friend and neither is her husband. It would be best to cut contract with them.", "NTA - Don't invite these nutcases.  For why would you have anything to do with them now they have excess drama baggage?  Sounds like 8 simple rules to date my daughter that are so onerous that guess what, no one want to date your daughter.  Write these two off, you're done.", "NTA. She isn\u2019t your friend anymore. Don\u2019t invite them and don\u2019t engage with her anymore. I\u2019ll bet she\u2019ll reach out all pikachu face when she realizes no invite. Just say it\u2019s an intimate occasion and You\u2019ve invited friends and family that support and care for you and it\u2019s quite obvious from her reaction to the profile that she and Karl don\u2019t fall into that dynamic.   \n\n\nThen just move on. You deserve a better friend.", "\u201cI really don\u2019t appreciate being gaslighted when I tried to talk to you directly. Not being invited to things for a year is obviously on purpose.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but I\u2019m not going to be involved or try to figure it out. If you\u2019d like to have a conversation that makes sense let me know.\u201d\n\nHonestly though I\u2019d just ghost the shit out of them. It\u2019s not worth the energy.", "Nta. Op, leave. Leave this friend and her husband alone. Please donot get yourself in this mess. This is extremely weird , like extreme. Donot invite them to your weddings , block them, go no contact and forget they ever existed. There is something seriously wrong with your friend.\nFirstly, shes extremely disrespectful and oblivious to your feelings and doesnt seem to give a damn about you. \nIf i am completely being honest of what i am able to gather from this, your friend is not who you think she is\nThere is something serious going on in your friends life. \nMany are commenting that Paige is in a abusive relationship, i think its the opposite. \nNot once were you able to talk with Karl.\nPaige specifically said to get all contact through her and that Karl stopped communication and everything else( from what paige said). And why is it said that you should never contact Karl ever again?\nBecause you might get a entirely different story from Karl\nThere are 3 possibilities\n1) Paige is angry that Karl has that dating profile. She kind of thinks that you might want to get with her husband and is thus keeping their distance. Or she is angry that you have put a barrier in their relationship by telling her this.\n2) There is something weird going on which you will hear from Karl. \nBest of luck for whatever you end up doing.", "Well, I guess not inviting them to your wedding was \u201cjust a matter of chance.\u201d\n\nThis is intensely weird behavior from them, especially your friend.", "NTA, and I don't know what Paige is but she's not your closest friend. The relationship has run its course. Just move on and let them keep their odd marriage.", "People are weird and I have no clue what is going on or why she is behaving this way. Requiring all communication to only go through her suggests the idea that she might have told him something different than she told you, but since she is the one you are friends with, I don't see why you'd interact with Karl anyways beyond basic politeness.\n\nRegardless, evaluate your wedding invitations based on how close you are to the people involved. If you feel you were good friends but are not good friends now, don't feel obliged to invite them. If you think this is a temporary thing and you will be better friends in the future, or it could affect your relationships with well-meaning but uninformed other friends, maybe invite them but keep some distance as a buffer while they work through whatever this is.\n\nPossible overinterpretation since we only have a tiny snapshot from one side of the situation: Are you thinking that Paige thinks that Karl is attracted to you and is making sure that the opportunity for cheating is not there? If that's the problem certainly talking it out is better than playing make believe? However, if that is the problem, and Paige isn't ready to discuss it, bringing it up probably won't go well.\n\nNTA", "Are you sure Paige hasn't murdered Karl? \n\nJk\n\nNTA I would cut your losses and stop contacting either of them. Karl is cheating/planning to cheat and Paige is aware but has decided that YOU are the enemy for voicing your concerns. She has made her choice so leave her to it.\n\nGive yourself time and space to mourn the loss of this friendship but it is for the best to avoid being embroiled in this shitty situation.", "You're NTA, but you have to face the facts. Paige decided to stay with her husband, and will no longer really be your friend. You two are done.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you handled the online dating profile situation in the absolute perfect way. You aren't making assumptions, just passing along information and when your friend responded, you let it go. Good for you. \n\nNow, their response since then has not been handled well. And this list is...yikes. First, she's clearly lying to you. You know what you used to be invited to at their home and how frequently, and it isn't like it has been a month, it has been a year. For you to have not been invited over in a YEAR means something has changed. And to go from contact with Karl to none, obviously something has changed. \n\nJust don't invite them. And while slightly petty, I think you just don't invite them and don't say anything. Give them the same energy they are giving you. Let Paige bring it up to you, which should be fun since she is so conflict avoidant, and then tell her- given your list of odd demands and making it obvious Karl doesn't like me while also not being honest with me, I figured it was best to not have awkwardness on my wedding day. \n\nAlternatively, you could be less petty and either just invite her and tell her- Karl hasn't spoken to me in a year, I'd prefer he not come and I certainly don't want to wait until my wedding day for a \"pleasant surprise\" of someone who has ignored me from a year to just show up. Or you can tell her, given her list of rules and that she is clearly avoiding telling you the truth, it is better they don't come. \n\nAnd if you are worried how your friend group may react to them not coming (if you have a larger shared friend circle), once you know the situation with Paige, I'd tell them a really abbreviated version (Karl doesn't like me, it hurts my feelings but this is for the best) so they can help be a buffer to any drama or questions about them not being invited.", "NTA. Cyber crime, yeah right. You busted him and they are having a lengthy psychodrama around it.\n\nIt would be best if you didn't invite them. It is too bad but the consequences are rippling out and you don't need the stress.", "Are you sure Karl knows about any of these gifts or invitations etc? Because your friend is making it sound like she just doesn't want you together for whatever reason. Maybe because she hasn't done anything about the dating profile and doesn't want you to mention it (even though you said you wouldn't).", "NTA, OP, your friend is not acting like a friend. Apparently she has cut contact to a minimum. Whether you send an invitation or not is your decision. She may or may not attend, with or without her husband. You can only infer what has created this chill as she is being evasive.", "So many weird stipulations. I suspect Karl is toxic and Paige is walking on egg shells/bending over backwards to enable his... whatever he is. If you do send an invite, be clear you need an accurate RSVP for planning purposes. But you WNBTAH if you decide not to invite their weirdo drama to your wedding.", "NTA. I wonder if Paige is feeling insecure about the entire situation. You leading with not being aware of their relationship dynamic and not judging can sound, to some parties, like you\u2019re open to a dynamic that isn\u2019t familiar to all of you, with no judgment. Some people could perceive that as you suggesting you\u2019re interested.\n\nThis sounds like someone who A) Is trying to control her husbands interactions with women and B) Isn\u2019t sure if you\u2019re interested in her husband or not and is trying to keep you away from each other.\n\nRegardless, that\u2019s a super messy situation. It doesn\u2019t seem like an oversight that you haven\u2019t been invited to any events with them past year. It\u2019s not just a coincidence that you saw him on the app and stopped receiving invites. \n\nThis is supposed to be one of the happiest moments of your life and your closest friend gave you a list of rules about how to invite her and her husband. Nobody should be putting extra stress on your plate right now. It\u2019s not your fault that she isn\u2019t willing to communicate honestly with anyone about this situation and she\u2019s TA for putting these rules and restrictions on you instead of addressing problems in her own marriage. She doesn\u2019t sound all that close to you anymore and she sounds like she made that decision pretty quickly a year ago.", "NTA. You caught her husband cheating. There is no way she believes he was impersonated. He probably figured out it was you since you doing online dating. He\u2019s not a good person. You know you\u2019re being purposely excluded. I would back off this friendship and move on. Don\u2019t invite either of them to the wedding.", "Uninvite her. She doesn\u2019t respect you. Or herself but that\u2019s another story. \n\nUninviting her can also be a \u2018pleasant surprise\u2019. \n\nNTA", "Wnbta\n\nA true friendship is not one-sided. It just isn't.", "NTA. They are treating you like YOU are the one who cheated!!  At the very least they threw YOU under the bus just so they could keep up their facade of a marriage. Write them both off and be free of them.", "Those people aren't your friends anymore", "NTA unless you stay involved with Paige, then you would be one to yourself. You deserve much better than whatever the hell this classifies as.\n\nI think it's time to say \"thanks for the explanations you provided\" and then block and ghost her. If she ever runs into you and inquires (or through common friends), you can respond that it's all by chance, she shouldn't create a fuss or ever bring it up with any of your friends, and she should take it in stride.", "Info: a year ago you were on dating apps, now you're getting married? Moving kind of quick, aren't you?\n\nBut NTA about not inviting them. Clearly, you are no longer as good of friends as you once were. And both of them are acting super shady: why should  who found it matter who found the profile of it was \"fake\"? For that matter *why should it matter if it was real?*. Paige is being just as suspicious here as Karl, and both are limiting friendship with you. They don't need invites until they can explain what's going on.", "YWNBTA: \n\nHonestly you were just trying to be a friend and got torn into a weird constellation and were confronted with an distant behavior by your \u201efriend\u201c. I am not to judge why she does not want to tell her husband that you know, but it seems as if there was something odd she does not tell you openly. \n\nMaking requests for your wedding and how you shall invite him, what to expect and how to treat him seems commanding. It is YOUR special day and YOU should not be worrying about her marriage issues. So if you feel better not inviting both them is ok. You are the bride your choice. But I would tell her this in advance and not just sending out invites to others and she learns it from third parties.", "These aren't friends. Friends are straight up with each other and prioritise communication between themselves. From the information you've provided, it leads me to believe that Paige has told Karl and is trying to control the entire situation. I don't believe Karl's profile was a fake one with someone else using his pictures either.  \n\nIt's your wedding, and I wouldn't invite either of them. Karl is rude and incapable of being straight up with you. She seems controlling and like she's too afraid to be honest that he doesn't like you etc. \n\nNTA.", "I woukd invite Paige but not Karl, just because of your long history with her, and because she still communicates with you. Unlike Karl, who, apparently, can no longer be bothered to acknowledge your existence.  \n\nBut I have to say I find this gatekeeping between you and Karl is odd and suspicious AF. One of these days you may hear of their divorce or see them on the news. \n\nNTA Do whatever you want regarding the invites. But if it was me?

Cause he knew the day would come someone gonna find his profile and tell Paige about it, so when the moment came and Paige questioned Carl about the Profil Carl could carelessly give Paige his phone and say \u201esee for yourself it\u2019s not mine\u201c Paige goes through his phone and believes him of course. Carl would then proceed to ask Paige where did she have this information from and she would tell him from my friend and he would say \u201ethat\u2019s weird you\u2019re friend is really flirty with me I think she wants something from me but I always ignored it and didn\u2019t think to much of it, who knew she would be capable of that, making a fucking fake profile to split us up\u201c. Of course Paige believes him and boooommm OP is the bad jealous friend that wants her man.

And that\u2019s why Paige wants any contact to go through her between them both, while Carl was actually hiding from OP because of confrontation. Yha I think honestly Paige believes his lies and OP can do nothing about it cause Paige made up her mind and also the decision to stay with Carl. Being in a long term friendship with Paige will bring nothing but damage, Paige is gonna or already is bad mouthing OP to other people for trying to split them up.

If you were just being a good friend looking out for her, and he knew it was a misunderstanding due to identity theft, why would he be mad at you? He thinks you have some loyalty to him and would assume it's fake and not that he's cheating? Either he's a cheater and your friend is ashamed to let that knowledge out/is willfully ignorant or he's hugely insecure and can't stand that her friend thought he was cheating.

It's a whole them problem, not a you problem. This situation is so uncomfortable. Save yourself drama and a headache, and don't invite them to your wedding.

One such night as I was leaving, her bf followed me to their door and from behind me grabbed my hand and put it on his junk (over thin shorts) suggesting we should go have sex. I freaked TF out, said no, and about ran to my door. Came to find out he had pulled this shit with another woman in our neighbors/friends group. So I decided to tell Rhonnie.

I just wonder because since you're going to be marrying someone, then this person should know already your best friend and her husband, right? So maybe he has some opinions, some ideas about this whole thing particularly since your friend wants her husband's invite (if they're a married couple why not both their names on the invitation?) to come through YOUR FIANCE not you... I'm confused at that specification, like are they close? Should her husband have a separate invitation from hers even though they're husband and wife?\n\nBecause I have two theories wild as they may be:\n\n1. She thinks you wanted to hook up with him so she's keeping you away, she probably confronted him and thinks he wants you or you want him. \n\n2.

Either she did tell him when pressed or he figured it out himself.  It's not your fault, but her trying to work it out with him and still remaining friends with you might be impossible or at least too hard for now.  If they didn't have an open marriage (and I think she would have admitted it to you at that point if they did), it might be humiliating to her that you know what you do and she still hasn't left him.  She has to either believe you or leave him - and she sadly needs to stay married to the creep more than she needs your friendship, whether she can't leave financially, emotionally or both. \n\nAgain, it's not your fault, but this condition dumping is probably her way of letting you go without actually coming out and saying it.  She or they know that list is too exhausting to deal with.  Not saying the words allow both of them to still be the \"good guys\".  \n\nI'm sorry.  Again, you did the right thing.

Something isn't adding up.

Notice how Paige not only has all the answers, but also all the boundaries.\n\nNTA. If you want answers, find a way to communicate directly with Karl with Paige finding out until after. If you want your wedding drama free, then don't invite them and go NC. Food for thought though - of he is cheating, then Paige is acting out of character, if she's setting him up then she's doing a very good job of it by convincing you it's no big deal, either way it looks like she's already starting to isolate him and that could have a whole other connotation.", "NTA - friendship has been over for a year.", "NTA\n\nAll the top comments covered the main points about how she's not your friend, there's too many conditions on the relationship, about not inviting her to the wedding etc, I'd like to add that the way she describes him makes it seem like you should bow down to his presence, that you should be grateful he graces you with his face at all at *your* wedding.\n\nSomething similar happened to me, felt like deja vu.

When she asked me who added who, like you mentioned I considered him a distant friend, I said he added me, then she inquired how he got my ph# and I said \"remember that night we all met for dinner and you forgot your phone was dying so you saved my number in his phone?\"\n\nAfter that she was like, oh yeah okay well just delete him and with no questions I was like OK! She tried giving some explanation that he won't let her add his friends so he shouldnt add any of hers, and at the time I took it at full face value and agreed with that logic. After that our relationship became so scarce and tense, she hardly spoke with me and only reached out when she wanted something and we want from talking once a fortnight to once every 6 months to never. We didn't implode, we just kind of fizzled out and I'm pretty sure it had something to do with him.", "NTA. I think you may start thinking your friend is doing an avoidance dance. I think your friend is lying to you and there's more going on than what she was telling you. If it wasn't true both their behaviors wouldn't of change like it appears. I think this is not a friendship anymore", "NTA. She has made many points I would say are inconceivable. I'd more or less reply with \"I am sorry. I truly am and this seems to be affecting our group as a whole and my opportunities to hang out with the people I care about. As such, I will most definitely NOT be inviting Karl to my wedding in any shape or form, not even a consideration, and I will consider it likewise with you. Do not take this personally, take this in stride and understand that even as this is Karls and your decision to distance yourselves from me, this in turn is MY decision to not have a toxic and uncomfortable environement for my wedding.\"", "Also have you thought of having an open conversation with Karl? I think that's what your friend is more afraid of.", "Seems like the only \"pleasant surprise\" in this would be if you dumped both your flaky friend, and her cheating husband...they're a couple of idiots...", "NTA she's clearly no longer your closest friend... this whole situation is very weird", "Nope.  She is the asshole for lying about not telling Hurl and for being dumb enough to think someone would steal his pics to make a profile on a dating site.  Then letting him act like an ass to you because you found it.  That would be my last interaction with them.  Expect her back when they divorce.", "NTA - Either Karl was trying to cheat on his wife, or they have an open relationship. In either case, your friend is covering things up and distancing them from you. Let her know that if they decide to talk to you, you'd be happy to continue the relationship. Until then, drop them from the wedding plans.", "YWNBTA. Invite neither. They are no longer your friends", "NTA. Sounds like Paige is in an emotionally abusive and controlling relationship. She probably doesn't realise it. He's cutting you out, through her, because you're now a threat to that dynamic. The other friends didn't see that profile and say something about it, so they're safe. You're NTA for eliminating that toxicity from your life. Sounds like she needs a friend like you, though.", "Anybody else get the feeling that Paige is trapped in a abusive relationship?", "You need a sit down with your friend if you still value your relationship with her.  If she doesn\u2019t clear up anything during the meeting, then you should tell her that you\u2019re considering not inviting Karl to the wedding.", "She\u2019s not your friend anymore, if you don\u2019t want to invite you absolutely do not have to. Why cause extra stress on your wedding day? Congrats on getting married! :)", "After that, why do you even want to friends with them? I wouldn\u2019t even bother thinking twice about letting these people go.", "NTA.  Sounds to me like your friendship has run its course, at least temporarily.  If and when Paige wakes up, she may wish to resurrect the friendship.  This is my impression based on your post.  For now, she's not sure who to believe, you or Karl.  She wants to believe Karl's side of things, but deep down there's that nagging doubt.  She does believe you but Karl has likely told her all sorts of lies, including that you've been coming onto him.  She wants to believe his lies but his version of events doesn't quite ring true.  But she tries to convince herself that his explanation of identity theft is feasible and tells him she believes him.  Paige is trying desperately to control the situation, to prevent anything from tearing her world apart, in order to hang onto Karl.  So she thinks she needs to keep you two apart.  She's afraid that if you and Karl are brought together, all the deceptions (his and hers) are going to be exposed.  It's not a coincidence that you've not been invited to their home since the revelation.  If I was in your shoes, I would tell Paige that I value her friendship but that I feel it is best if she and Karl do not attend the wedding as it would be very uncomfortable for all of you, but that you will be there for her in the future.", "NTA.", "Paige stopped being your closest friend a while back. You are starting a new chapter in your life. Time to put this bizarro one to bed.\nYWNBTA if you don't invite your former friends", "WTF are those two I.D.TEN.T smoking?", "Wow this friendship sure has a lot of rules. All of them are Karl\u2019s. He\u2019s angry because he figured out it was you who ratted him out. However, him and Paige\u2019s treatment of you is degrading. I\u2019d leave them both off the list. NTA", "NTA her conditions seem too much work and unnecessary. If I were you I would have stayed away. Friendship shouldn't be this much work.", "ESH... The only reason I say this is why do you let your closest friend talk to you in such a manner.  If my closest friend talked to me like that I would call them out and be like what the hell is up?  Why are you talking so strange?", "WTF kind of bizarro situation is that friend spinning. I would 100% not invite either one, who wants that kind of mojo at their wedding. Something is up with them. I almost wonder if SHE made the profile and Karl is the actual victim. That is the only situation that makes any sense for your friends behavior.", "NTA: \n\nI\u2019d just honestly tell Paige that you\u2019re no longer interested in being friends with her or Karl. They\u2019re both being weird towards you as if you did anything wrong. You were simply just looking out for your friends best interest. I\u2019d honestly either say f*ck both of them and not send and invite or tell Paige if she wants to be invited you, her and Karl need to have a sit down.", "NTA - your friendship with those two people is over. And it sounds like that is for the best. \n\nDo not invite either one. When/If she asks tell her 'it is just a matter of chance.'\n\nThe whole situation is sort of creepy actually. I'm sorry that you were put in that position when you were just trying to help a friend.", "NTA. I agree with the other comments that your friend is trying to save face. From what I\u2019ve understood, I don\u2019t think Paige is planning on attending your wedding anyway. I\u2019d still invite them. Maybe by the time the wedding comes around, things would have sorted themselves out.", "I had this problem when I got married.  I knew a friend of mine husband was very prejudiced and I wasn\u2019t going to invite them then dad said, put the monkey on their back.  Invite them and then it\u2019s their choice if they\u2019re going to come.  I invited and they never responded to the invite.  Worked out fine.  Maybe just send the invite and let them decide", "NTA\u2026I honestly don\u2019t think she even sees you as a friend at this point", "NTA. Sadly, I think this friendship has run its course.", "Your relationship is over. Don\u2019t invite them end contact. You know too much it\u2019s over. Will never be the same. She lied he\u2019s a cheater or their swingers.", "NTA \n\nWhy do I get the impression Karl is buried in Paiges backyard?", "You inserted yourself into someone else's marriage.\n\nYou are already the asshole.\n\nYou've destroyed this relationship, whether you realize it or not.\n\nThere's no reason to invite them.", "Cut your losses", "NTA. This doesnt sound like friendship", "Has it occurred to you that Karl wants out of his relationship and she's trying to cut him off from everyone so that he's dependent on her? I bet she wants you to go through her for all the invitations so that he isn't aware of them cuz she doesn't tell him, and she can create distance between you and him.", "NTA your friend is gaslighting you. There\u2019s no way that an entire year without an invite is pure chance. I don\u2019t know if the signals say he doesn\u2019t like you or if it means she is the problem and hiding it. Either way, turnabout is fair play. She or he won\u2019t invite you, so you don\u2019t invite them. And since she won\u2019t tell you who is excluding you, you can\u2019t determine who is being exclusionary. \n\nHer demands are not boundaries. They are rules to control you. She is telling you how to think, react, and feel. Boundaries are about behavior. She isn\u2019t acting like a friend. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to continue giving her space in your life. At least not if she\u2019s gonna keep gaslighting you. Whether or not the separation is temporary until behavior changes or if it\u2019s permanent is up to you.", "Thank you all for your responses/suggestions.\n\nIt's hard to respond to each and every comment, but I'll quickly address some of the common questions/requested pieces of information.\n\nKarl is alive and thriving on the several messenger/social media groups that the three of us and many of our common friends are a part of. He has been seen in person by many from our larger pool of common friends who have been routinely invited to their place. \n\nAlthough I haven't been invited to their place, I have met Paige at my place or some neutral location several times in the past year.\n\nI did meet someone quite compatible last year (this was early in January) and we get married next year in May/June, so it would be over two years when the wedding happens. This may seem quick to some, but is a timeline that works for us.\n\nMy bf has met Paige, and is completely aware of the situation. He feels Paige is simply trying some cartwheels to protect her marriage.", "Agree 100%. NTA.", "This is a good way to approach it. When they share the same friend group and have not been invited for a year, it is purposeful.\n\nI would avoid both of them and drop the friendship. A best friend is someone who should be able to have an open honest discussion with you.", "Exactly this. Such an incredibly bizarre situation I would want no part of.", "I really wonder if she swiped on his profile and he got an alert. So he\u2019s avoiding her because he knows she saw it and a terrified she\u2019ll blow the whistle. And I wonder if Paige never confronted him.", "Scrolled way further than I thought to see someone mention the timeline lol.", "Scrolled way too long to find this", "It\u2019s probably Paige feeding the whole dynamic. My guess is she\u2019s ensuring OP doesn\u2019t share the info with their mutual friends as she wants to maintain status quo. OP should not invite them and should tell all their mutual friends about the entire thing.", "Bad juju.", "My guess, all jokes aside, is that he's not setting those boundaries.  I'm guessing it's allll from the friend.  Either she never confronted Karl and is embarrassed about that, or they're poly/swingers/ENM and she doesn't want it found out, or she and Karl are in a really bad relationship situation and she wants it hush hush.  \n\n\nHe would \"probably decline\" because she would never tell him about the invite.", "I suspect Karl told Paige that OP hit on him and he turned her down, which is why Paige is being so cagey now.", "I was thinking the same thing. I'm not so sure Paige ever talked to Karl. I bet the \" gifts\" that OP sent for him were claimed by Paige, \" oh honey,  look what I got you\" type of situation. Nothing Paige has said makes a bit of sense. If I were OP I would be having a face to face with Karl to get to the bottom of this. Why is Paige pushing so hard for OP to NEVER speak to Karl?? Especially if they were semi friendly before", "My first thought was that Paige had created the profile and is Catfishing. It's the only reason I can think of why Paige doesn't want OP to have ANY contact with her husband.", "The friend is trying to keep OP and Karl apart because she knows his story about the dating app is bullshit and she doesn't want to face the truth.  She's probably afraid Karl will say something to OP.", "Yes, that for sure! NTA OP!  \n  \n^(Sorry I\u2019ve just really wanted to do that for a while and I\u2019m high so I thought it\u2019d be funny.)", "Not a freezer vibe, a body-propped-in-a-chair-being-talked-to-like-he's-still-alive crazy-pants vibe. I want to know where the mutual friends are in all this, and pump them for info because this is weird as fuuuuuuuck. (Or it's a writing exercise and I would \\*totally read\\* the author because the response from the \"friend\" is raising the hair on my neck a little, thanks many seasons of CSI)", "Now you mention it- I haven\u2019t heard a peep from him since the Tinder 2021 mix up\u2026 another case of stolen identity I believe", "Karl??? Kaaarrrrl? Where are you?", "I see Karl, the fog everyday but I also know Paige got a nice new concrete pad for her nice B.B.Q. station about a year ago . . .", "So...not dismembered or rendered out for soap fat. That's a start, I suppose.", "Karl was at my house a few weeks ago, with his boyfriend."]}
