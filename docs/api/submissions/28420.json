We were also flatmates for a few years. I was much closer to Paige and my relationship with Karl could be, at best, described as a distant friend.\r  \n\r  \nLast year, when I was on a dating app, I happened to come across Karl's profile stating that he was looking for something casual. His profile was fairly detailed and consistent with what I know of him. After some contemplation, I decided to share this information with Paige. I told her that I was unaware of their marriage dynamic and was in no way judging, but I did feel she should know that this information is out there.\r  \n\r  \nPaige told me that it was a case of impersonation and that they planned to file a complaint with the cyber crime cell. She also mentioned that I should never bring this up with Karl, and that she would not tell him how she got this information. I agreed, and we left the matters at that.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, since this incident, things have changed quite a bit. Karl has stopped all forms of communication entirely. I am not invited to their house for any celebrations or gatherings (previously I was invited frequently). When I invite them both, Karl has declined the invite (through Paige) every single time. Karl has not acknowledged any gifts I have given him lately.\r  \n\r  \nRecently,  I decided to have an open conversation with Paige. I told her that I felt that the group dynamic had shifted quite noticeably. I also asked if it had anything to do with the dating profile. I requested clarity on the situation to help me draw my own boundaries.\r  \n\r  \nThis is what Paige had to say:\r  \n\r  \n*Karl still doesn't know her source of information about the dating app, and that I shouldn't ever bring this up with him (I wasn't planning to).*\r  \n\r  \n*Me never being invited to their home or for any plans even with our common friends for over a year (even though I live 20 minutes away) is just a matter of chance.*\r  \n\r  \n*She wants all of Karl's interaction with me to happen via her because she wants it like that (she said so explicitly)*\r  \n\r  \n*I shouldn't create a fuss and that it shouldn't matter to me if someone doesn't like me (while also simultaneously saying that if Karl didn't like me, she wouldn't tell me because that's private between them).*\r  \n\r  \n*I should take whatever response Karl gives me \"in my stride\"*\r  \n\r  \n*I should invite Karl to my wedding but not directly and the invite must be through G and that I shouldn't worry if he refuses to attend.*\r  \n\r  \n*I should expected Karl to not attend, but if he does then I should treat it like a 'pleasant surprise'*\r  \n\r  \nThis whole situation has become uncomfortable for me and I am now contemplating not inviting them both to my wedding.\r  \n\r  \nWIBTA for not inviting my closest friend and her husband to my wedding?", "created_utc": 1696690880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1728fjn/wibta_for_not_inviting_my_closest_friend_and_her/", "score": 279, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What I think is you caught Karl trying to or in the process of cheating and were being a good friend by telling Paige. Paige has made her choice to stay with Karl. I get the feeling he knows it was you, despite Paige\u2019s claim of not revealing her source, because he probably saw your profile on the site around the same time he got caught. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t invite either of these people. There are way too many conditions on your relationship with them and it\u2019s setting you up to fail.", "She's no longer your friend and neither is her husband. It would be best to cut contract with them.", "NTA - Don't invite these nutcases.  For why would you have anything to do with them now they have excess drama baggage?  Sounds like 8 simple rules to date my daughter that are so onerous that guess what, no one want to date your daughter.  Write these two off, you're done.", "NTA. She isn\u2019t your friend anymore. Don\u2019t invite them and don\u2019t engage with her anymore. I\u2019ll bet she\u2019ll reach out all pikachu face when she realizes no invite. Just say it\u2019s an intimate occasion and You\u2019ve invited friends and family that support and care for you and it\u2019s quite obvious from her reaction to the profile that she and Karl don\u2019t fall into that dynamic.   \n\n\nThen just move on. You deserve a better friend.", "\u201cI really don\u2019t appreciate being gaslighted when I tried to talk to you directly. Not being invited to things for a year is obviously on purpose.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but I\u2019m not going to be involved or try to figure it out. If you\u2019d like to have a conversation that makes sense let me know.\u201d\n\nHonestly though I\u2019d just ghost the shit out of them. It\u2019s not worth the energy.", "Nta. Op, leave. Leave this friend and her husband alone. Please donot get yourself in this mess. This is extremely weird , like extreme. Donot invite them to your weddings , block them, go no contact and forget they ever existed. There is something seriously wrong with your friend.\nFirstly, shes extremely disrespectful and oblivious to your feelings and doesnt seem to give a damn about you. \nIf i am completely being honest of what i am able to gather from this, your friend is not who you think she is\nThere is something serious going on in your friends life. \nMany are commenting that Paige is in a abusive relationship, i think its the opposite. \nNot once were you able to talk with Karl.\nPaige specifically said to get all contact through her and that Karl stopped communication and everything else( from what paige said). And why is it said that you should never contact Karl ever again?\nBecause you might get a entirely different story from Karl\nThere are 3 possibilities\n1) Paige is angry that Karl has that dating profile. She kind of thinks that you might want to get with her husband and is thus keeping their distance. Or she is angry that you have put a barrier in their relationship by telling her this.\n2) There is something weird going on which you will hear from Karl. \nBest of luck for whatever you end up doing.", "Well, I guess not inviting them to your wedding was \u201cjust a matter of chance.\u201d\n\nThis is intensely weird behavior from them, especially your friend.", "NTA, and I don't know what Paige is but she's not your closest friend. The relationship has run its course. Just move on and let them keep their odd marriage.", "People are weird and I have no clue what is going on or why she is behaving this way. Requiring all communication to only go through her suggests the idea that she might have told him something different than she told you, but since she is the one you are friends with, I don't see why you'd interact with Karl anyways beyond basic politeness.\n\nRegardless, evaluate your wedding invitations based on how close you are to the people involved. If you feel you were good friends but are not good friends now, don't feel obliged to invite them. If you think this is a temporary thing and you will be better friends in the future, or it could affect your relationships with well-meaning but uninformed other friends, maybe invite them but keep some distance as a buffer while they work through whatever this is.\n\nPossible overinterpretation since we only have a tiny snapshot from one side of the situation: Are you thinking that Paige thinks that Karl is attracted to you and is making sure that the opportunity for cheating is not there? If that's the problem certainly talking it out is better than playing make believe? However, if that is the problem, and Paige isn't ready to discuss it, bringing it up probably won't go well.\n\nNTA", "Are you sure Paige hasn't murdered Karl? \n\nJk\n\nNTA I would cut your losses and stop contacting either of them. Karl is cheating/planning to cheat and Paige is aware but has decided that YOU are the enemy for voicing your concerns. She has made her choice so leave her to it.\n\nGive yourself time and space to mourn the loss of this friendship but it is for the best to avoid being embroiled in this shitty situation.", "You're NTA, but you have to face the facts. Paige decided to stay with her husband, and will no longer really be your friend. You two are done.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you handled the online dating profile situation in the absolute perfect way. You aren't making assumptions, just passing along information and when your friend responded, you let it go. Good for you. \n\nNow, their response since then has not been handled well. And this list is...yikes. First, she's clearly lying to you. You know what you used to be invited to at their home and how frequently, and it isn't like it has been a month, it has been a year. For you to have not been invited over in a YEAR means something has changed. And to go from contact with Karl to none, obviously something has changed. \n\nJust don't invite them. And while slightly petty, I think you just don't invite them and don't say anything. Give them the same energy they are giving you. Let Paige bring it up to you, which should be fun since she is so conflict avoidant, and then tell her- given your list of odd demands and making it obvious Karl doesn't like me while also not being honest with me, I figured it was best to not have awkwardness on my wedding day. \n\nAlternatively, you could be less petty and either just invite her and tell her- Karl hasn't spoken to me in a year, I'd prefer he not come and I certainly don't want to wait until my wedding day for a \"pleasant surprise\" of someone who has ignored me from a year to just show up. Or you can tell her, given her list of rules and that she is clearly avoiding telling you the truth, it is better they don't come. \n\nAnd if you are worried how your friend group may react to them not coming (if you have a larger shared friend circle), once you know the situation with Paige, I'd tell them a really abbreviated version (Karl doesn't like me, it hurts my feelings but this is for the best) so they can help be a buffer to any drama or questions about them not being invited.", "NTA. Cyber crime, yeah right. You busted him and they are having a lengthy psychodrama around it.\n\nIt would be best if you didn't invite them. It is too bad but the consequences are rippling out and you don't need the stress.", "Are you sure Karl knows about any of these gifts or invitations etc? Because your friend is making it sound like she just doesn't want you together for whatever reason. Maybe because she hasn't done anything about the dating profile and doesn't want you to mention it (even though you said you wouldn't).", "NTA, OP, your friend is not acting like a friend. Apparently she has cut contact to a minimum. Whether you send an invitation or not is your decision. She may or may not attend, with or without her husband. You can only infer what has created this chill as she is being evasive.", "So many weird stipulations. I suspect Karl is toxic and Paige is walking on egg shells/bending over backwards to enable his... whatever he is. If you do send an invite, be clear you need an accurate RSVP for planning purposes. But you WNBTAH if you decide not to invite their weirdo drama to your wedding.", "NTA. I wonder if Paige is feeling insecure about the entire situation. You leading with not being aware of their relationship dynamic and not judging can sound, to some parties, like you\u2019re open to a dynamic that isn\u2019t familiar to all of you, with no judgment. Some people could perceive that as you suggesting you\u2019re interested.\n\nThis sounds like someone who A) Is trying to control her husbands interactions with women and B) Isn\u2019t sure if you\u2019re interested in her husband or not and is trying to keep you away from each other.\n\nRegardless, that\u2019s a super messy situation. It doesn\u2019t seem like an oversight that you haven\u2019t been invited to any events with them past year. It\u2019s not just a coincidence that you saw him on the app and stopped receiving invites. \n\nThis is supposed to be one of the happiest moments of your life and your closest friend gave you a list of rules about how to invite her and her husband. Nobody should be putting extra stress on your plate right now. It\u2019s not your fault that she isn\u2019t willing to communicate honestly with anyone about this situation and she\u2019s TA for putting these rules and restrictions on you instead of addressing problems in her own marriage. She doesn\u2019t sound all that close to you anymore and she sounds like she made that decision pretty quickly a year ago.", "NTA. You caught her husband cheating. There is no way she believes he was impersonated. He probably figured out it was you since you doing online dating. He\u2019s not a good person. You know you\u2019re being purposely excluded. I would back off this friendship and move on. Don\u2019t invite either of them to the wedding.", "Uninvite her. She doesn\u2019t respect you. Or herself but that\u2019s another story. \n\nUninviting her can also be a \u2018pleasant surprise\u2019. \n\nNTA", "Wnbta\n\nA true friendship is not one-sided. It just isn't.", "NTA. They are treating you like YOU are the one who cheated!!  At the very least they threw YOU under the bus just so they could keep up their facade of a marriage. Write them both off and be free of them.", "Those people aren't your friends anymore", "NTA unless you stay involved with Paige, then you would be one to yourself. You deserve much better than whatever the hell this classifies as.\n\nI think it's time to say \"thanks for the explanations you provided\" and then block and ghost her. If she ever runs into you and inquires (or through common friends), you can respond that it's all by chance, she shouldn't create a fuss or ever bring it up with any of your friends, and she should take it in stride.", "Info: a year ago you were on dating apps, now you're getting married? Moving kind of quick, aren't you?\n\nBut NTA about not inviting them. Clearly, you are no longer as good of friends as you once were. And both of them are acting super shady: why should  who found it matter who found the profile of it was \"fake\"? For that matter *why should it matter if it was real?*. Paige is being just as suspicious here as Karl, and both are limiting friendship with you. They don't need invites until they can explain what's going on.", "YWNBTA: \n\nHonestly you were just trying to be a friend and got torn into a weird constellation and were confronted with an distant behavior by your \u201efriend\u201c. I am not to judge why she does not want to tell her husband that you know, but it seems as if there was something odd she does not tell you openly. \n\nMaking requests for your wedding and how you shall invite him, what to expect and how to treat him seems commanding. It is YOUR special day and YOU should not be worrying about her marriage issues. So if you feel better not inviting both them is ok. You are the bride your choice. But I would tell her this in advance and not just sending out invites to others and she learns it from third parties.", "These aren't friends. Friends are straight up with each other and prioritise communication between themselves. From the information you've provided, it leads me to believe that Paige has told Karl and is trying to control the entire situation. I don't believe Karl's profile was a fake one with someone else using his pictures either.  \n\nIt's your wedding, and I wouldn't invite either of them. Karl is rude and incapable of being straight up with you. She seems controlling and like she's too afraid to be honest that he doesn't like you etc. \n\nNTA.", "I woukd invite Paige but not Karl, just because of your long history with her, and because she still communicates with you. Unlike Karl, who, apparently, can no longer be bothered to acknowledge your existence.  \n\nBut I have to say I find this gatekeeping between you and Karl is odd and suspicious AF. One of these days you may hear of their divorce or see them on the news. \n\nNTA Do whatever you want regarding the invites. But if it was me?

I also wonder if Karl may have lied to Paige to indicate you only told her because you were attracted to him and he turned you down.  \n\nBottom line it sounds like your friendship with this couple at least for now has run it\u2019s course.  \n\nSo nope to inviting them to your wedding.  If Paige had the audacity to ask you could say you didn\u2019t want to add drama to her life. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d block them but I would suggest considering minimal  communication with Paige so only acknowledging things like her birthday, anniversary and happy whatever holiday. \n\nI would honor Paige\u2019s request and initiate zero communication with Karl.  If you have him on any group chats remove him completely or anytime you respond remove him from the distribution. \n\nPaige\u2019s response or lack there of will provide you with the info needed to determine if communication with her should cease.", "NTA. Are you sure she's told him about finding the profile? Despite her going to report it as a cyber crime (good grief, really?), sounds like she has chosen to say nothing to him and keep her marriage going and is trying to ensure you never have an opportunity to say anything to him about it. She has probably lied to him about you to make sure she can maintain the lie. She's made her choice and would think long and hard about having her at your wedding.", "Karl attends. \"Hey Karl, it was a pleasant surprise to see you on that dating app \". Never have to deal with Karl again. NTA\n\nP.S. Don't do that.", "NTA.  The friendship has run its course as long as Paige sticks with Karl.\n\nHave seen Karl since the first incident?   Perhaps Paige took matters into her own hands and Karl is no more. /s", "Nta. She's got quite the list of behaviors for you to follow. Who needs that kind of conditional friendship. It's weird. \n\nI'd MAYBE invite her. But not him. I'm not jumping thru hoops for someone who apparently doesn't like me on my own wedding day. Nope \n\nUpdateme", "YWNBTA for not inviting these people. They are no longer your friends if you have been snubbed for a year. Move on with life and don't give either of them a second thought.", "I think it\u2019s funny that he\u2019s the one setting all these boundaries when it was him that was (most likely) attempting to cheat. But yeah this is a bunch of immature nonsense on their part, and it\u2019s not good to have that around in your wedding.", "Honestly, what relationship? She doesn't get invited to their home any more and her friend is brushing it off as if it's just some big coincidence.\n\nPersonally, she should probably just end the friendship and quit contacting either one of them.  I most assuredly would not invite either one of them to my wedding. Def NTA", "I would let Paige know that if she ever needs help leaving Karl she should let me know, but until then I'm not playing these games.", "Paige went no contact for a year with OP, so I doubt she would respond to such a message.", "Balls out.\n\nIt's really the best path.\n\nBut OP, I can understand why it feels so fraught leading up to your wedding.\n\nIt sounds ike friend said either way she will attend? Were it me, I'd roll w that.\n\nYou will have plenty of other things to pay attention to, day of. If he comes, \"Karl! I'm so glad you came! Thank you for being a art of our special day. It means a lot.\"\n\nYou don't have to mean it.\n\nThis gets yu throught the next year or so. Then you can make choices about this relationship.", "Exactly, she's already tried the adult conversation. They're not really worth the breath of trying again. Just move on now.", " said all that way better than i did so like yay  what they said", "Lol I wondered if Paige had actually created the dating profile for some reason and is desperately trying to keep her husband and OP separate so neither finds out it was her. \n\nNTA.", "There is clearly something going on. I would try to find some way to contact Karl directly, since Paige is putting up so many barriers to prevent this. Even when declining an invite it was though Paige and not Karl himself.", "I was also curious about the timeline.", "Don\u2019t gossip, just be like I am really hurt that I haven\u2019t been invited much lately, but shrug and he like oh well.", "To be fair... it's the friend who SAYS that Karl is setting these boundaries... but it's impossible to know if this is actually true. It's quite possible that the friend is the one setting boundaries, but putting the blame on her bf. Given that OP can't actually talk with Karl, it would be hard to actually learn the truth.  What the friend is doing and saying sounds more than a little suspicious.", "I think the BFF is the one setting the boundaries to \"rebuild trust\" with him. She doesn't trust him not to hit on OP", ">I think it\u2019s funny that he\u2019s the one setting all these boundaries\n\nCurious where you\u2019re getting that - the only actual boundaries are: \n1) all interaction going through Paige because Paige wants it that way and \n2) not discussing the dating profile with him, which again is Paige.", "Yep.  This is the adult way to handle it.", "This, this is perfect.", "Yeah, that's my thinking. Paige made it so she could, idk, accuse her husband of making it later? But when her friend found it instead, she panicked? Paige is being super suspicious.", "I had a similar reaction.  Like, is this a false page she created to use as \"proof\" in a divorce?  They aren't reporting to police bc Karl has no idea the profile exists?", "Or maybe she's keeping Karl in the freezer/s", "The friend isn\u2019t even saying Karl is setting the boundaries - she\u2019s saying she\u2019s setting the boundaries.", "\ud83d\udc40 that was a huge plot twist."]}
