I do it when I\u2019m 90% asleep, just on the edge of being fully unconscious, and I\u2019ve pissed bedmates off with it who can\u2019t fall asleep until I stop - but I literally can\u2019t fall asleep without doing it. the solution is just to sleep separately.

It\u2019s enough that my brain can\u2019t settle, because *something is happening the environment is not calm enough to sleep* (doesn\u2019t help that I have PTSD so my flight/fight response is haywire and always scanning for threats).\n\nHe does it without thinking.

Look, my husband rubs blankets. Back and forth. Driving me slowly insane. I can ask him to stop until I love my ever loving mind - but he instinctively will start up again. You have every right to be agitated - and she probably keeps doing it instinctively. I'd make a point to never go to bed at the same time, OR like we've done - two sets of blankets.

Everybody has nighttime rituals and it can be annoying to get used to someone else\u2019s. You probably do something that drives her nuts, too.

I actually do this too. I don\u2019t even realize it. It too drives my partner crazy. He\u2019ll just point it out that I\u2019m doing it. I stop.

I\u2019m positive she\u2019s not doing it on purpose and I also totally understand how it\u2019s annoying.

It makes me angry. I wish it didn\u2019t but it does, especially after asking 2-3 times for him to stop. I\u2019ve resorted to crashing on the couch 1-2 nights a week. When our schedules are opposite- it keeps the peace.", "NAH but expecting her to stop is unreasonable. You could try what I've learned to do w/ my SO loud breathing/snoring? I adopt it/integrate it into my own falling asleep ritual. I match my breathing to the rhythm & count my breaths... what's funny tho is once I fall asleep & my own breathing gets louder for a spell, often it will wake them up & they end up hitting the couch. No hard feelings. And a lot of people- far more than most realize- sleep separately. A healthy relationship doesn't necessarily require co-sleeping. The opposite can in fact be the case.", "This sounds like my villain origin story. \n\nDoes she have dry skin? Is there some other kind of fidgeting she could do in bed?\n\nAre you often sensitive to certain sounds? You may have heard of misophonia, where people have strong emotional reactions to sounds. Might help your wife understand the degree to which this bothers you. \n\nI\u2019m going NTA bc lord have mercy that would drive me crazy.", "I tap my foot in bed without knowing it almost every night and my fiance HATES it.

Just sayin, there\u2019s alternatives like separate beds and even separate rooms. \n\nI sleep better in my own bed and own space.", "Put two single sheets on your bed so you don't get the tug.", "Hi OP.

Restless leg syndrome? Spend a day (together!) googling exotic diseases with that as a the symptom... well, if she has that kind of a sense of humor.\n\nOtherwise: all the suggestions below. Also, buy her a pair of cashmere bed socks - nicely wrapped. They aren't meant to be worn except in bed. They'll help if her feet are cold and possibly if they're itchy.  Even if not, they probably won't sound swish-swish.\n\nNTA for what you find irritating, but maybe a bit for letting this turn into an argument and not trying to find a cure.", "NTA. I\u2019m a light sleeper so I empathize. Even if it\u2019s restless leg or stimming or whatever, it\u2019s preventing you from falling asleep. She should definitely get it checked out, but you might be better in separate beds/rooms to sleep. Maybe try separate blankets/sheets? Good luck.", "You aren\u2019t TA because you have a reaction but seeing it\u2019s your problem you have to find a solution vs putting that onus on her. Sounds like she has restless leg syndrome which honestly the few times I had it I almost put my head through the wall because I needed to keep moving to stop myself going insane. It can be really bad and cause automatic movement. She might consider treatment for it but need to find a way for it to stop bothering you. Seperate blankets might help with the tugging feeling etc as a start.", "NTA", "YTA for continuing to argue. This is likely not even a conscious thing she decides to do, you need to decide if it bugs you enough that you would rather not share a bed with her and if so, rearrange your sleeping.

It can be a sign of iron-deficiency anemia, which would be an easy fix.  My dad swore by chicory \"coffee.\" A low-dose benzodiazepine helps me with RLS and periodic limb movement disorder.  I've ripped holes at the bottom of my sheets before!  \n\nNTA and I feel ya.  Misophonia activates the fight/flight reflex and is almost impossible to control.  I can barely be in the same room as my husband when he eats.  If he wanders in with an apple, I'm out of there.", "My partner and i started putting a throw blanket near her feet for her to essentially do the foot thing in so it basically muffles the sound/ feel for me, while also being easier on her joints (she says she\u2019ll wake up and her ankles hurt) and it works unbelievably well. If you get hot use a cooling blanket instead", "Good suggestion", "Yeah like, this sounds like restless leg syndrome or something.", "Just the thought of sleeping with socks drive me crazy.

Ask her, respectfully, how long she's been doing it and let her know, again respectfully, there are treatments if it is indeed restless leg syndrome.", "I used to hate the idea of wearing socks to bed.

I'm not entirely sure my partner didn't make this post.", "WOW - ok, even with thick blankets? Well then separate beds or rooms it is...I'd have agreed with the white noise machine, or ear plugs, or noise cancelling headphones, but the feeling of the sheets pulling also seem to bother OP and these things won't help with that.", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d my husband moans when he eats too.
