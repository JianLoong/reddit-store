The idea that couples have to sleep together or their relationship is ruined is such a con. It's so annoying sleeping next to someone else unless your styles of sleep match. Yeah, cuddles are nice and whatever, but the cons list is much longer than the pros list IMO.", "Holy crap, my mom did this growing up! My siblings and I would roast her into oblivion (all out of love of course!).\n\nI think the answer here is sleeping in separate beds. Also bose makes a really good night bud that fits inside your ears. Maybe you can try some white noise, or just have the noise canceling on to drown out the swish swish \ud83d\ude02", "NAH, it's misphonia vs restless legs and neither are easily if at all controllable. Earplugs or separate rooms will help.", "Get separate blankets. I do the swishing & it drives my poor husband nuts. Separate blankets is super helpful,", "My dad does the swishy feet thing, and I hated it as a kid. His feet were also dry AF so it sounded even worse. I've told my partner this story before, he pointed out that I do it too. I never noticed. Now I notice when I do it, and it makes me miss him, his swishy feet, and watching football/game shows with him cause it always happened watching TV.\n\nGet some earbuds or some plugs. She might do it for several reasons, and even when I'm conscious of doing mine. I can't stop or I feel anxious. Have you bothered to talk to her about it?\n\nI say NAH. Have a conversation, come to a understanding, make a solution together. I know it's annoying but it might happen subconsciously.", "I literally only came here because the title made me giggle.\nI empathise with the feeling of triggered you\u2019re talking about and NTA. My husband and I usually sleep separately due to his shifts too, but if we do sleep together you best believe there\u2019s compromises on both sides so there\u2019s no murders in the night", "NAH\n\nMy husband does the exact same thing, I have SPD and he does it right before bed and the sound and motion is the absolute worst for some reason. He hates feet so I've started asking if he needs me to itch them for him when the noise goes on for too long. I've come to understand it's a sort of reflex/habit he does before going to sleep, and it's one of those things I'll have to deal with.", "NAH, but you do realize that your wife might have a medical condition that causes this?", "NTA\n\n\nI get. I'm one of those people where certain sounds just make me angry out of no where. Chewing, skin rubbing on skin (think hands and feet) it sounds horrible and makes my ears itch...it's just an irrational rage that fills me. \n\nThe big thing is when my spouse does any of the above he does not realize he is doing it. He has ADHD and just makes a lot of noise in general like tapping or leg shaking. Just....roll with it or get ear plugs you can sleep with. It's a comfort thing. \n\n\nAt the same time, I think it fair to mention the foot thing is distracting. Just be nice about it.", "NAH.\n\nPersonally I have to swish my feet as well to sleep. I struggle sleeping if I don't. It irritating you isnt your fault either though.", "INFO. Is your wife a cricket?", "NAH, it's probably an unconscious self soothing thing she's done her whole life, there's no way she's doing it just to irritate you. If it genuinely seems like she can't stop it, and it drives you *this* insane, get separate sheets for each of your sides of the bed, or even sleep separately.", "My wife and I have separate blankets. She wants to burrito herself and I want to ball it up between my legs. Works great! OP, get that so you don't feel the tug and a white noise machine (or just a relaxing music youtube video) so you don't hear the swish.", "Some useful ways to think about this, which are mentioned below as well:\n\n- Spouse might have restless leg syndrome. Certainly it sounds like it is involuntary. Comments below have treatment suggestions.\n\n- OP might have misophonia in which everyday sounds trigger feelings of rage. \n\nSince both of these are involuntary it\u2019s an NAH situation. But you do need to find practical solutions to the problem. \n\n- Separate flat sheet/blankets and a white noise machine. \n- Cuddle on the couch, and sleep in separate beds with a white noise machine. \n- Sleep in separate rooms.\n\nWhatever solution works for you as a couple is the right one, even if other people are judgemental about it (eg \u201cmarried people should sleep in the same bed\u201d).", "I know it sounds a bit crazy to be so incredibly angry at a specific noise, but I have misophonia which gets triggered at specific noises and for no reason I will suddenly get extremely rageful. It's very distressing, and unfortunately having gone to medical professionals there is nothing I can do about it. Just putting this out there because sometimes you can't work on something if your brain is wired a certain way. Agree on separate sleeping areas though. Just be mindful not everything is simple to get over/ ignore.", "Try earplugs and separate sheets/blankets as a first step. I have misophonia myself and though it does not solve all triggers, it greatly reduces them so I can have peace. \n\nFor disclosure, sleeping separately might still be a path forward, but try earplugs as a starting place. \n\nGood luck!", "My thoughts exactly! I definitely want to scream at people for horrible mouth noises and tbh any repetitive noise that I hear on a daily basis has the  potential to trigger my misophonia. NAH.", "Same, but I don't want to yell, I just get nauseated and feel like my nervous system is trying to claw itself out through my skin.", "I do it usually when I\u2019ve just washed my sheets.", "Oh my god, same. My wife eats with her mouth open a LOT because she has cystic fibrosis and can't always breathe well enough to close her mouth. We have to eat in separate rooms unless we're in a noisy environment like a restaurant.", "Man, I wanted L-theanine to work for me so bad but it gave me a constant stomach ache (I already have gut issues) :(", "Lol iron levels are a trigger? I can use RLS coming back as a free iron blood test! \n\nJk but this is interesting. Also, did you mean blood transfusion or did you actually get an iron IV or something? I'm on 300mg iron a day and it doesn't do much (yes I take vit C with it).", "Might not be restless legs, I do the exact same thing as OP's wife cos it's soothing and helps me sleep, it's like a miniaturised version of rocking yourself to sleep", "Weighted blanket for the rescue", "The paracetamol used sparingly I hope", "Babe?

It's very relaxing and puts me to sleep.  I know it's a bit weird. And if it bothers you,  maybe separate bedrooms?", "My SO does something similar to this in the mornings. It\u2019s how I tell their about to wake up. NAH", "When I  read your post the word misokenesia popped up in my mind, I just read about it this morning. I hope I spelled it right. Or maybe your wife needs thermal socks. Try to have a talk about it.", "NAH.  I feel for you.  I absolutely could not live with this.  However, it seems like your wife is not trying to be a jerk and drive you insane.  You should certainly consider separate beds.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA for the small reason that it seems like a sensory thing for you both. As an autistic person, I understand the sheer irrational rage one feels when overstimulated. For her, it\u2019s a stim she can\u2019t always help. Find some way to cancel out the noise or even separate yourselves.", "Well I actually do that myself when I am getting close to sleep, always have. Why don't you guys get the adjustable bed with two mattresses? Each one has its own sheets and blankets so you are separate but still together. Some of them come with heating features and all kinds of cool gadgets.", "NAH.\n\nThis sounds like an involuntary action, likely serving to relieve anything from anxiety or nervousness, to avoiding muscle cramps. She can't help it, and you can't help but get annoyed. Asking her to stop isn't great, but I understand why you do. It's a package deal though so it comes with her, either find a way to cope or you will need alternative sleeping arrangements you can't \"fix\" it.", "NTA implies the wife is the asshole for doing it, do you mean NAH?", "\u201cYour near unbridled rage\u201d Consider that in certain cases overstimulation is something that causes irrational rage.", "Yeah I do this same thing to relax in bed. It\u2019s not involuntary, it\u2019s just a really comforting action. I found out my mom does the same thing haha", "I think your right that it's a stim. I do the same thing. Thankfully I'm not married so I know this isn't about me.", "Separate blankets is the way", "I have misophonia and my wife has restless leg. Make sure she has enough potassium and is getting enough sleep. Is it better if she's not exhausted when she goes to bed? Try to both accommodate one another and assure her you're not judging her when you bring attention to something she's doing unconsciously.\n\nGood things can come of this combo too - I trained her out of tooth grinding years ago, and speaking from a dental perspective, it's a super harmful habit!", "I get this sometimes about foot swishing and it 100% has to do with the kind of socks they're wearing! Some textures of socks make a noise I'm ok with, others make my whole body feel itchy when I hear it.", "Magnesium did not work for my mom (but she had serious gallstones so now I wonder if maybe it wasn't the magnesium) but she is doing acupuncture and has pressure beads in her ear to help with her RLS", "You can get actual iron infusions! I think they are only given if your iron is at a really really low level or if regular iron supplements are not helping raise the levels enough. It can make you extremely nauseous though.", "Same here. It helps me to relax.", "Can\u2019t bc too hot. I\u2019ll stick with swishing.", "You're perfectly valid for feeling that way, but look up Restless Leg Syndrome, she physically can't stop it. Her entire body probably feels tense, she may be exhausted but she's got an overload of leftover energy in her body and that's the only way to get it out. Best bet here is to probably sleep in different beds, just for the comfort of both of you no one is an AH here, it's just bad circumstances", "YTA. Hers is an involuntary self-soothing coping mechanism likely carried from childhood. Your irrational response speaks to a rage issue in need of therapy. You're not handling anger well and my guess is this isn't the only area of your marriage where it shows.", "I do this too, it\u2019s a stim\nSo yeah YTA", "That\u2019s a stim. She likely can\u2019t fall asleep without that self soothing technique.", "Maybe she can wear some thin socks/ stockings...", "This is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of someone outside my own family who does this. I can tell you that it is a subconscious instinct. \n\n\nImagine growing up, nobody ever made you stop sucking on your thumb. Because they couldn\u2019t see you doing it. So you just kept on doing it forever. It\u2019s a self-soothing mechanism that is essentially hardwired into her brain. It\u2019s hard to explain *how* relaxing it is. But it\u2019s so tied to relaxation and calm for me that if I\u2019m having trouble falling asleep, I\u2019ll start doing it and it always knocks me out. I bet if I had tests done, they\u2019d see my brain release some kind of dopamine or something when I do it. \n\nClearly it\u2019s annoying to you, but you\u2019re not going to change it, and getting angry at her is kind of pointless. Instead of acting like this is something she is doing *to you*, try approaching this as if she is your life partner whom you love and see if there is a solution.

Or separate beds. \n\nBut yeah, kind of YTA.", "NAH\n\nNeither her movement nor your irritation are voluntary.\n\nIf it's the sound, try foam earplugs \nIf the motion, either stagger bedtimes (go to bed half an hour later than her, or read until she stops moving) or get separate beds.\n\nBe kind about it, because it's no one's fault. Be a team about strategizing solutions.", "Does your wife have Restless Leg Syndrome? Because rubbing your feet together is one way to help with that. I rub mine together when I go to bed to help with my RLS. It helps to calm the nerves in my legs.

Kind of.", "I thought you were talking about Trailer Park Boys and I was very confused", "I like those beds a lot of European hotels have where there are two twin beds pushed right up next to each other, with separate duvets folded on each one.

I have ADHD, and when my spouse does it I *can't* sleep - the slightly irregular noise snags my brain.\n\nNot as bad as snoring though. I shared a room with a baby once who snored *all the time* (medical issue - poor little mite got surgery for it as soon as he was big enough) and by 2am I was about ready to defenestrate myself from the frustration of not being able to do anything (you'll wake the baby) and not being able to sleep.", "You don't get misophonia.\nIt's really not voluntary.

It's what they preferred to use since my ferritin levels were crazy low and building them up with a supplement would take a long time and drag out the symptoms I was having.\n\nIt's also worth noting that low iron/ferritin and anemia are actually not the same thing (anemia has to do with red blood cell count), though one  often causes the other. So if you do get tested and you're not anemic, it doesn't mean you don't have low iron and/or ferritin!"]}
