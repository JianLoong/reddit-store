Our neighbors across the street have 2 kids (9 & 7) that our kids quickly became friends with. We would hang out with the parents as well and my wife became close friends with the mom.   \n The dad and I got along fine, but never got as close as my wife and the mother. \n\nUnfortunately, about a year ago, the parents separated and the mom filed for divorce.  Apparently, the dad had an affair.  The mom moved out as the house was owned by the dad before they got married.  She took the kids with her.  According to my wife, the mom tried to get full custody of the kids, but the dad asked for and was granted partial custody.  So he has the kids 3 weekends a month, the rest of the time they stay with their mom.  I've only very briefly talked with the dad about the whole thing as he obviously feels a lot of shame about the affair and we aren't close enough for me to feel I can ask deep questions about it.\n\nThe kids all still play together when they can.  I noticed my wife would make it a point to make sure our kids invited them over to our house.  I also noticed that my wife was asking the neighbor kids some pretty odd and honestly rather intrusive questions about their dad.  Like if he has \"friends\" over at his house when they are there.  What he feeds them, what rules he has at home, do they feel safe there, etc.  \n\nThis past weekend the kids were at our house and stayed over for dinner and my wife asked the kids if they like hanging out with their dad or mom more.  I cut in before the kids could answer and changed the subject to watching a movie after dinner.  As my wife and I were cleaning up, I asked her what the hell all the questions are about.\n\nShe said that her friend is still trying to get full custody of their kids and she asked my wife if she would keep an eye out for anything that she could use to build the case against the dad.  I was shocked.  I told her that's none of our business and she needs to stay out of it.  I told her it seems like her friend is still upset about the affair and is using that anger as justification to try and take the kids away from their father.  \n\nI told her that neither of us has ever seen a single thing to indicate that this guy is a bad father. Sure, he had an affair and that makes him a bad husband, but that has zero influence on his ability to be a good loving father.  I told her what her friend asked to do her was gross and the fact that she's going along with it is something that I strongly disagree with.  I told her she needs to mind her own business.\n\nShe said she's just trying to look out for her friend and she's trying to make sure that the kids end up in a situation that is best for them.  I told her that essentially spying on our neighbor is not her responsibility and she's definitely in the wrong for asking the kids the kind of questions she is.  She feels she's completely justified, but I do not.", "created_utc": 1683558814, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bv02t/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_mind_her_own_business/", "score": 566, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunately, the friend and her husband split up after he had an affair.  They currently have split custody of the kids, but my wife's friend wants full custody.  She apparently asked my wife to essentially spy on her ex to try and get dirt to use against him for full custody.

Even if he is a jerk.", "NTA. And her friend is wasting her time. Custody has been granted and it sounds like there was a full fight and legal ruling by a judge as mom tried to get full custody and dad was granted 3 weekends. \n\nIn most places in the US, unless there's a substantial change of circumstances, you can't just get back in front of the judge for a re-do. She could be appealing, but unusual. \n\nIn fact, her having your wife interrogate the kids is most likely against the parenting agreement/ruling. She could help lose her friend time if the father can prove the continued violations of the agreement (badgering the kids for info).", "NTA\n\nUsing the kids as pawns in a divorce is wrong. And that's what your wife is doing on behalf of her friend.\n\nAsk her how she'd feel if someone asked your kids those kinds of questions. Ugh!\n\nBeing there for her friend is one thing. But grilling the kids with an agenda of uncovering \"dirt\" on their dad should be off the menu. And don't think that the kids won't notice the odd questions and eventually say something to their dad about it. Your wife's friend may just find that it all backfires directly on her and affects her custody situation in a negative way.", "Nta. Your wife is way out of line.", "NTA - but you should remind your wife that in her quest to help her friend remove the kids from their dad, she is causing parental alienation.  The dad is going to eventually figure it out, because the kids are going to answer honestly about the questions and conversations.  Whatever information your wife gets and passes along to her friend, is going to come out in a custody hearing. You wife would potentially be called to testify that she was the one to ask the questions or obtain the information.  The dad would potentially have grounds to sue your wife, and her friend would,lose custody or custody time for parental alienation.\n\nYour wife\u2019s mission is going to negatively affect her family because your kids are going to be upset when they lose their friends because the father won\u2019t let them be around your wife when he figures out what she is doing, and you potentially face legal bills if the dad decides to sue your wife (even if he loses, you still have to pay a lawyer to represent your wife).\n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t think there are any ramifications for her or you or your children, and there are serious ones.\n\nYour wife is obsessed with helping her friend and is willing to risk her own family\u2019s well being to do it. She needs therapy.", "NTA. This seems extremely vindictive and kids should not be exploited like this.", "NTA. I'd be even more blunt and tell your wife that she's being that creepy, nosy neighbor that no one likes and everyone \"jokes\" about avoiding. Also that she is being so blatant about her spying that the kids will likely tell their dad she makes them uncomfortable and giving him ammunition to take his ex to court for attempting parental alienation.", "NTA\n\nI can understand her wanting to be sure that your kids are still in a safe and supervised environment when they're at the dad's house playing with the neighbor kids since it's a change in circumstance. \n\nI can also understand a newly divorced mother wanting reassurance that her kids are safe and happy while they're in the father's custody for the weekend. \n\nBut attempting to gather evidence and directly questioning the kids for the purpose of influencing a court case definitely crosses a line. If she has concerns about her kids' well-being due to the custody arrangement, then she needs a guardian ad litem appointed by the court, not a nosy best friend.", "NTA.   Your wife\u2019s behavior is creepy and invasive, and it\u2019s affecting your relationship.  I know it\u2019s wouldn\u2019t want to be married to a person who behaved like this. It would definitely impact my affection and respect for them.", "You\u2019re right.

NTA.", "NTA. \"looking out\" for your friend is very different than actively trying to sabotage those kids relationship with their father to help your friend win custody. your wife is doing the latter, and she needs to knock it off. she's already ensuring they see less of him on the weekends he has them by making them hang out at your place, and on top of that she is asking them very pointed questions obviously intended to set him up as a villain. You may want to tell the dad that your wife said this, it may negatively affect your kids relationship with his kids because they might see each other less, but his wife is being extremely manipulative and he needs to be aware of that.", "NTA at all. This sounds super sketchy.", "Wow! NTA. Please tell your wife that those kids have enough stress.  Let them enjoy your kids as friends.", "NTA. Your wife is doing more than spying. She is contributing to parental alienation, and the dad would be within his rights to seek a court order barring contact between the kids and your wife.\n\nI also agree with you and not your wife that the divorce, being resolved, has nothing to do with custody or visitation.", "NTA - It's not your place to be involved in someone else's life like that. They need to come to terms with their own lives, and it's grotesque how she is involving you and yours in this mess she has going on with her ex-husband.\n\nAnd to use the children as a weapon like that is downright shameful. That's right, she's USING her kids as weapons against her ex-husband.", "NTA.  Warn the dad.  And tell your wife you will warn the dad.", "NTA its one thing for your wife to make sure the children feel safe but quite another to be meddling in other adults relationship issues.

Her actions are a separate thing though.", "NTA.\n\nThe ex-wife weaponized your wife\u2019s relationship with her kids.", "NTA \n\nWife needs to keep out of it.  In a relationship, it takes 2 yes answers for a yes, 1 no for a no.  You gave your wife a no.  It ends now.", "NTA\n\nKeeping an eye out for anything her friend could use is not the same as interrogating the children. \n\nWhich is a completely ridiculous thing to do anyway, because, come on, as if their mother hasn't already asked them all those questions.", "NTA and if your wife can't be trusted not to act as a spy (and even influence those kids), and she won't stop interacting with them because of the playdates, then you should at least inform the father.", "NTA - bad husband does NOT equal bad father.  If your neighbor finds out, he's potentially got a case that his ex-wife is alienating his kids against him.\n\nAs a divorced parent, I will tell you that it's almost impossible for one parent to have 100% of the time-sharing (custody).  It essentially requires blatant illegal activity or actively endangering the physical health/safety kids.  Alcoholism, neglect, emotional/mental abuse and manipulation, none of that matters.  Your friend's ex-wife is listening to bad advice if she thinks she has a chance of changing the court's decision.\n\nHonestly, I'd tell him what his ex is up to.  And reinforce to your wife that her behavior/questions/intrusiveness with the kids is not okay.  If she wants to stake out his house and keep a log of visitors, that's one thing, (a very creepy thing), but interrogating his kids for his ex-wife?  Not okay.", "NTA\n\nYour wife can have this kind of talk with the mom. But absolutely not with the kids. Absolutely not.", "This looks like wife's friend is trying to alienate the kids from the father using the legal system.

Definitely a red flag", "NTA. Tell Rockford to close it down. He has the kids three weekends a month and that is somehow a travesty?

NTA.", "NTA I hate when people use their kids to punish another parent, and your wife is putting herself in the middle of that.  Unless you two actually see signs of neglect or abuse she needs to stay out of it.  The man only sees his kids a few weekends a month and the ex wants to lessen even that small amount of visitation?  That\u2019s punitive against the husband for his affair, not a reflection of his parenting.", "NTA absolutely your wife should be staying out of it. Also the kids shouldn\u2019t be put in a position where they are being asked to pick one parent over the other. Please go and approach the dad and explain what is going on and tell him you have told your wife it\u2019s not on but you think that perhaps the kids shouldn\u2019t come round to your house as much and especially if you\u2019re not there. Also bear in mind that this is they way she is behaving if anything ever happens to cause you and your wife to split remember how low she can go!!! Be prepared", "NTA. Like someone else said if the kids volunteered something concerning themself that would be one thing. But interrogating them and asking leading questions is different and your wife needs to butt out. I get that she wants to support and help her friend but this is crossing the line.", "NTA.   Some questions on how things are going is fine and obviously taking notice of anything that does go wrong and reporting to the mom is fine but don\u2019t go looking for dirt.  But understandable positions on all sides.", "NTA - This issue is the divorced couple's concern, not your family's. It sounds manipulative for your wife and the ex-wife to extract information from the kids, too.

Your wife is not only the asshole in this situation but I assume in life. She\u2019s not even related and she\u2019s trying to force those children into an uncomfortable conversation over which parent they like more!

Our neighbors across the street have 2 kids (9 & 7) that our kids quickly became friends with. We would hang out with the parents as well and my wife became close friends with the mom.   \n The dad and I got along fine, but never got as close as my wife and the mother. \n\nUnfortunately, about a year ago, the parents separated and the mom filed for divorce.  Apparently, the dad had an affair.  The mom moved out as the house was owned by the dad before they got married.  She took the kids with her.  According to my wife, the mom tried to get full custody of the kids, but the dad asked for and was granted partial custody.  So he has the kids 3 weekends a month, the rest of the time they stay with their mom.  I've only very briefly talked with the dad about the whole thing as he obviously feels a lot of shame about the affair and we aren't close enough for me to feel I can ask deep questions about it.\n\nThe kids all still play together when they can.  I noticed my wife would make it a point to make sure our kids invited them over to our house.  I also noticed that my wife was asking the neighbor kids some pretty odd and honestly rather intrusive questions about their dad.  Like if he has \"friends\" over at his house when they are there.  What he feeds them, what rules he has at home, do they feel safe there, etc.  \n\nThis past weekend the kids were at our house and stayed over for dinner and my wife asked the kids if they like hanging out with their dad or mom more.  I cut in before the kids could answer and changed the subject to watching a movie after dinner.  As my wife and I were cleaning up, I asked her what the hell all the questions are about.\n\nShe said that her friend is still trying to get full custody of their kids and she asked my wife if she would keep an eye out for anything that she could use to build the case against the dad.  I was shocked.  I told her that's none of our business and she needs to stay out of it.  I told her it seems like her friend is still upset about the affair and is using that anger as justification to try and take the kids away from their father.  \n\nI told her that neither of us has ever seen a single thing to indicate that this guy is a bad father. Sure, he had an affair and that makes him a bad husband, but that has zero influence on his ability to be a good loving father.  I told her what her friend asked to do her was gross and the fact that she's going along with it is something that I strongly disagree with.  I told her she needs to mind her own business.\n\nShe said she's just trying to look out for her friend and she's trying to make sure that the kids end up in a situation that is best for them.  I told her that essentially spying on our neighbor is not her responsibility and she's definitely in the wrong for asking the kids the kind of questions she is.  She feels she's completely justified, but I do not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your wife frames this behaviour as, \"in the best interest of the children,\" but as they've seen nothing to show the father is detrimental to the kids what they're ultimately trying to find is dirt so the mother can get one over on him. This has less to do with what is best for the kids, and everything to do with ego.
