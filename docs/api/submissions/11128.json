We went to a concert together last month with some other people, and I was the one who booked the AirBnb and drove us there. On the drive back, we both kept talking about how much we liked staying at this AirBnb and how if we ever went to this city for a concert again, we should totally rebook it.\n\nI assumed that meant we would be booking it together for any future concert we both were going to. Fast forward to now: there is an upcoming concert that we are both planning to go to. It isn\u2019t for another month and a half or so, and the tickets haven\u2019t even dropped yet. Today, X told me about how she tried to book that AirBnb we stayed at for this new concert but it\u2019s so far out that the host didn\u2019t make the dates available for booking yet. At first, I thought she meant she was trying to book for us, but then she was like \u201coh, I\u2019m actually trying to book it for me and 3 of my other friends\u2026\u201d And basically just saying that I wasn\u2019t included in her plans for the AirBnb.\n\nShe said she was planning to buy tickets with her other friends and rooming with them. I wasn\u2019t upset with that part specifically because I have other friends who are going who I can buy tickets and room with. My main thing was the AirBnb. I know that neither of us really own it, but it felt kind of underhanded that she was telling me this almost as if she was calling dibs on booking it. But last time, I was the one who found the AirBnb, booked it, and corresponded with the host for everything. I feel like she could have at least talked to me about it and been like \u201chey is it okay if I do this\u201d or something considering we were both planning to go. It sounds stupid controlling of me but it would have made me feel better if she considered my feelings on this or something. Even though we didn\u2019t have concrete plans to book together, we did literally talk about staying there again if we ever went back.\n\nSo yeah, I was kind of mad. I didn\u2019t say anything to her and pretended it was fine and I don\u2019t think she thought anything of it either. I\u2019m pretty sure she assumes that we\u2019ll still be driving to the concert together because the friends she plans to room with are from another city. After that conversation, I went on AirBnb out of spite and DMed the host about the nights I was interested in that weren\u2019t listed yet. The host was happy to let me book in advance. Now I have the AirBnb reservation.\n\nPart of me knows it was just pettiness that fueled this whole thing. I feel a bit bad for going behind her back and booking the AirBnb knowing that she also wanted to book it, but part of me also feels justified.", "created_utc": 1677571643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11e0lbu/aita_for_booking_an_airbnb_my_friend_was_going_to/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m hurt because she was trying to book this AirBnb for her own plans without me not because I\u2019m upset about not rooming with her but because she was basically blocking me out of the AirBnb we had a verbal agreement to rebook together. I reached out to the host to book the AirBnb to ensure that I would be able to stay in this AirBnb regardless of whether that includes her or not. This doesn\u2019t interfere with her ability to book another place so her plans should be fine, just in another place.", "My issue with this was that we did technically plan to book again there together. I genuinely don\u2019t mind if she wanted to stay someplace with her other friends, it was specifically about this AirBnb.", "OP wanted to book that place, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is first come first served.", "I accept your judgment, although I\u2019m not worried about her driving by and seeing me there because that wouldn\u2019t realistically happen.

She wanted to book the same spot, not invite you and still expects you to give her a ride?\n\nTake the airbnb and do not give her a ride to the event.

BUT if you speak and decide to give up the reservation and she still doesn't include you, do NOT drive her to show", "You still sound vindictive. The fact that she made plans to book it without your involvement sounds like your primary motivation for booking it at all, since you readily admit your original thought was to book it together the next time you both made plans together. She made plans that didn\u2019t involve you. She\u2019s entitled to reach out where she will. The fact that you have such a strong attachment to this place to the point that you would look into booking it only after she had expressed an interest in doing so herself seems to suggest issues that you might want to explore moving forward.", "And this is where I say NTA because of this. Also, if she wanted it that badly she should of been on top if it more and reached out to the owners rather than just trying to do it through the site.", "The plan was \"We should do this again sometime\". \n\n\nAre you going to the concert alone?

Also possibly one of the other friends couldn\u2019t go and you could stay together again.", "Imma second this.\n\nShe decided to go to a concert with other people that she knew you were also going to. No issues there.\n\nBut that means you're not going together. You're not 'doing the AirBnB again' like you previously talked about.\n\nYou had a relationship with the host because *you* previously booked it. You're NTA for using it to go to a concert with *your* friends. There's not enough room for all of her other friends too.", "I appreciate your concern but I was fully planning to book the place after buying the concert tickets. Her involvement sped up the process but it doesn\u2019t change that I was still expecting to stay at this place. Because we\u2019ve been talking a lot about going to this concert together I do fully admit I thought we were going to stay together and I only would have moved forward with the AirBnb if we ironed out the plan like we had before. The situation isn\u2019t irreparable so that\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for outside input. I would accept a E-S-H vote but to say I\u2019m the only asshole here just feels like you aren\u2019t seeing the rest of what I said.", "I disagree. The next time they made plans together, fine. Book it together. But you make it sound like your friend is never allowed to stay there without your permission or your involvement. Which is wild to me.", "Even if one of her friends were to drop I wouldn\u2019t want to stay with them because I don\u2019t know her friends. I am just worried that she wouldn\u2019t take my feelings well because she\u2019s acted in self-interest in the past. For example, the last concert we went to she wanted better seats than we bought so she tried to photoshop new tickets and we sat in someone else\u2019s seats. We sat in those seats for a bit until the actual people who bought the seats kicked us out and then she ran and kind of abandoned me to take the better seat of the ones we had bought. I was so ashamed and I already was kind of reluctant to try her plan out in the first place because her photoshop was awful but she lied and said I bought the tickets, which put me on the spot. I don\u2019t really feel that she would be that sympathetic to me because as much as I like hanging out with her normally, I don\u2019t have faith in her to be a good friend when it counts.", "NTA. How does she plan to get to the concert tho? You're obviously not taking her.", "What I understood from your post was she planned to go to a concert with friends other than you. If I\u2019m being perfectly honest, the way you made it sound (to me, at least) was that your going to this same concert was strictly reactionary to her plans. I did not get the impression at all that this was a concert you were both planning to attend well in advance. And so I interpreted it thusly.\n\nWith this new information, I would say yes - ESH. That said, you still sound very vindictive regardless.", "I\u2019m only upset because we talked about going to this concert so much so she knew both of us were going to go and she knew that I would want to stay at that same place because we both talked about staying there again. I\u2019m definitely not saying that she\u2019s never allowed to stay there. As a friend, I would have appreciated if she had at least thought about talking to me about it", "That girl sounds awful and not the kind of person you want as a friend. Ditch the friendship, enjoy the AirBnB, concert and rest of your life without her and her selfish toxic crap.\n\nNTA", "Yeah, the concert is for something that both she and I talked about many times before because it\u2019s for our favorite band. I wish she had talked to me about it sooner so we could figure something out together because we could have also easily found a different AirBnb that could accommodate both her friends, herself, and me. In that sense it just felt like she valued that specific AirBnb over being able to stay with her friends and me. I do kind of get it because it was a nice place but if I was in her situation I would rather have found a bigger place. As I mentioned somewhere else in the replies, I did decide to text her about how I felt about the situation just because I fully admit it\u2019s unfair of me to just expect her to know my feelings without me saying anything.", "She doesn't have to talk to you about it, you don't own the place and you don't own the world.  She doesn't have to talk to you about anything if she doesn't want to."]}
