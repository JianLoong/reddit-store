A little while later, since nobody else was getting furniture, I got a couch off Facebook Marketplace. Holly also got a TV for the living room.  \n\n\u00a0\nRight after we got the TV, Holly demanded that we move the pole out of the backside of the living room so that the TV and couch could fit in the corner where the pole already is.  \n\n\u00a0\nI was confused by her request because the couch was already placed close to the centre of the living room and there was an outlet available for the TV to go in front of the couch. I asked Holly why she wanted to move it into the corner, and she said because she wants a \"cozy little nook.\" I told her that the pole is quite difficult to move and install, and the pole being in its existing spot gives me enough room; the new spot she suggested would have me slightly in the way of the hallway, and I couldn\u2019t tell if there was a stud where she wants to move it to.  \n\n\u00a0\nBecause of those reasons, I told Holly kindly that I wouldn\u2019t be moving the pole. and the couch can stay where it is on the other side of the living room. partly because I own the couch, and since she simply asked me, I'm allowed to say no. She didn\u2019t respond well to this; she contacted our rental company and told them that we had an \"unauthorised stripper pole\" in our unit that no one agreed to. An administrator came to our unit and told me that the pole needed to be removed.  \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI was obviously pissed she snitched on me, so I told Holly if she still wants her \"cozy little nook,\" she can get her own couch.
