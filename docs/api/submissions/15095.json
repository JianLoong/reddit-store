A little while later, since nobody else was getting furniture, I got a couch off Facebook Marketplace. Holly also got a TV for the living room.  \n\n\u00a0\nRight after we got the TV, Holly demanded that we move the pole out of the backside of the living room so that the TV and couch could fit in the corner where the pole already is.  \n\n\u00a0\nI was confused by her request because the couch was already placed close to the centre of the living room and there was an outlet available for the TV to go in front of the couch. I asked Holly why she wanted to move it into the corner, and she said because she wants a \"cozy little nook.\" I told her that the pole is quite difficult to move and install, and the pole being in its existing spot gives me enough room; the new spot she suggested would have me slightly in the way of the hallway, and I couldn\u2019t tell if there was a stud where she wants to move it to.  \n\n\u00a0\nBecause of those reasons, I told Holly kindly that I wouldn\u2019t be moving the pole. and the couch can stay where it is on the other side of the living room. partly because I own the couch, and since she simply asked me, I'm allowed to say no. She didn\u2019t respond well to this; she contacted our rental company and told them that we had an \"unauthorised stripper pole\" in our unit that no one agreed to. An administrator came to our unit and told me that the pole needed to be removed.  \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI was obviously pissed she snitched on me, so I told Holly if she still wants her \"cozy little nook,\" she can get her own couch.

She removed it preemptively", "She says she *told* them she was thinking of getting one installed and they said \"go ahead\", doubt OP would cop to being manipulative about how she asked them.

They're passive aggressive and again, manipulative. \n\nI think they both qualify for AH awards", "I don't even think it's this deep. I think men just don't care for strip dancing as a hobby, so they know nothing about it.

I have a feeling everyone was ok with it when the room was mostly empty but now that the rooms becoming furnished the stripper pole is obnoxious. I bet everyone is using the TV and couch, however it sounds like OP is the only one using the pole which means it should be out of the way of the other roommates. Preferably in her bedroom, assuming it doesn\u2019t fit the roommates are nice for allowing OP to keep it in the living room. Personal items should be left in personal spaces.", "They all assholes.  When you sharing a living area yall gotta compromise.   They didnt ask them to get rid of the pole entirely, they asked to rearrange the room so the sitting situation is better designed.  That's not a crazy ask.  And saying \"no because i dont feel like it\" isnt really a compromise either.  none of them know how to roommate properly.", "Love this response!

However if there is plenty of room in the new area and she is being difficult because of installation alone then yes 100 agree.", "Sounds like there's not a single dull moment there hahaha", "Yeah, speaking as a life-long renter, you ignore that and just put pictures up and secure whatever furniture you need to and fix it before you leave. None of the landlords I've had have ever cared and my current one is so happy I am using nails instead of the rental sticker things that cause more damage than nails most of the time. As long you make good at the end of the lease 90% of them don't care. Plus there's also the thing of being able to take them to the rental governing body if they disagree.

Obviously i'm speculating, but i think the biggest issue is mainly it was a pain to install and she doesn't feel like moving it.  So she basically told the others to go kick rocks. Which is why the reaction was instantly as strong as it was.  I could def. be wrong, but i feel like there might be at least a little bit of leeway.  In either way, the reaction gives me enough vibes.", "Yeah but does OP use the television? If so, then the TV and sofa are communal things.", "OP bought a couch and Holly bought the TV.", ">Imagine trying to sit on the couch and read a book while your roommate is pole dancing ffs!\n\nWhy is this an issue?

If they aren't centered on a stud they make big holes in the ceiling drywall.  If you mess up or put too much force on a move, you can knock holes in the walls.  Even if installation is done perfectly, a cheap pole or bad maintenance can cause breakage as well.  Even if installed well, the pressure plates tend to put dents in the ceiling and floor over time.\n\nLandlords absolutely put clauses into leases to ban poles.", "I feel sorry for the third room mate lol.\n\nIt's interesting that OP didn't mention their opinion on the current drama though.", "You do know that most people don\u2019t wear lingerie and heels when dancing at home right? Duh.", "The landlord isn't going to get involved in issues like that, they'd tell them to sort it out themselves. They only care if the lease is being violated.", "Tension poles require a stud, but they aren't hard to move.", "she said \"i was pissed that she snitched\" which implies that she wasn't supposed to put it up in the first place", "LMAO she got the pole to impress guys didn't she\n\nHahaha", "I agree, my post was more towards all the people who were shocked and horrified by a stripper pole. The location could be renegotiated, but if Holly could offer to see if there's a stud in another area. It should be a conversation, not an assumption that op has to move it.", "They wanted to create a nook, using a couch owned by the OP, *without the permission of the household or the owner of the couch*.\n\nHow is the OP worse than that?", "Landlord also, I think ESH. I have antique wood floors and plaster and lathe ceilings (also my house pre-dates the construction standard of 16\" on center stud and studs can be found anywhere from 13-23\" apart). Some ceilings have decorative plaster (those weird swirly bits) which is pretty near impossible to repair. I would have issues with a pole installation. \n\nWalls are pretty straightforward to fix, floors and ceilings are much trickier.", "An acquaintance of OP posted some info OP conveniently left out. Of main importance being that both roommates asked OP to move the pole. OP refused and told both of them they could not use her couch, so they bought another couch. Basically, the majority of the household wanted to move the pole and create the nook, and the majority of the household was fine getting another couch after OP forbid them from using her couch - that she had put in a common area. \n\nThere was more too.

Apparently someone who commented here knows you in real life and basically confirmed there's more to the story you aren't sharing and that you are in fact the asshole..

If this was about an exercise bike every comment would be NTA. It's literally not preventing them from using the room normally, and it was previously agreed upon.

At this point Issa wrap - I\u2019d be planning to move out. And I\u2019d throw out the couch. Now what?", "I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s there because there isn\u2019t room for it or else it would already be there.", "Another step to that would be to sell her couch (if OP doesn\u2019t use it much ofc). NTA. The roommate can have her cozy corner set up in her own room.", "Holly provided one solution (that we know of from the post) which would\u2019ve been a hazard and would block the hallway. The setup was fine as is, Holly just had her personal preference and instead of trying to workout something more with OP she tattled to the landlord. So it sounds like Holly didn\u2019t want a reasonable compromise and wanted her way hence she went to the landlord to force OP to have to move her pole.", "\"Hey, now that we have furniture, we'd like to use the common living room as a common living room\" is not, in fact, being a horrible roommate.", "Weight, exercise bikes, and yoga equipment can be put away. A stripper pole with clearance around it is awkwardly blocking off a chunk of the room all the time.", "The issue I have with that is it wasn\u2019t communicated initially. Had the roommates said \u201csure, stripper pole is fine for now until we have some furniture and put the room together for everyone\u2019s use.\u201d then yeah, OP would be an AH. But from what it sounds like, they gave her a blanket \u201csure, okay\u201d and are only now trying to change the set up.

There was no issue was that.

And when Holly didn\u2019t get her way and instead of working with OP to find a solution that works for the both of them she tattles on OP to get her way. So Holly was totally not being reasonable in this situation.", "Sounds like you had a roommate who was willing to communicate these boundaries properly. That's pretty rare", "I think OP is fine with not using a tv since they did not seem to have one in the first place.

If he didn't mind a dirty floor or the occasional wrapper being left out, I had two options, either deal with it or move out, because I couldn't punish him. I wasn't his mom.

Her roommates are paying for that living room too, they each get an equal say. It sucks, I get it, but that's living with roommates. You don't live with them because it's better, it's because it's cheaper. You don't get to take up a part of the communal living space unless everyone agrees.

You would not have that space without them.\n\nSo she told her roommate 'no' when she asked to rearrange the living room.
