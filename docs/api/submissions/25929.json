An adult roommate that did not know how to change the sheets on her bed had to ask roommates for help. Do you, your ex-husband or his wife want this to be your daughter?\n\nThese things may sound insignificant, but this a sign of a bigger problem. Children that are not taught at a young age to clean up after themselves, pitch in to keep their living space clean and how to keep themselves clean ( a.k.a be self sufficient) will not be good co-workers, roommates and partners.

Yes you should be spending quality time with your daughter but quality time does not always mean doing the funniest thing possible and ignoring reality. Trust me there is a big difference between the kids who know how to do basic house hold chores and those who dont and need to get others to do things for them.

At that age they generally want to. My mother had a whole system for brain development games that were about 'helping' fold laundry. I'm guessing that's why I could never figure out later on why fractions were supposed to be hard.", "My toddler knew how to clean up her toys.", "And why should your daughter help clean a place she doesn\u2019t live out. None of that mess is because of her. You are a horrible mother who treats her daughter like a maid to take clean up after the 2 kids you loved more than her since you kept custody of the younger kids. I hope your daughter father, her real parent, gets the little visitation you have with your daughter taken away for your daughter\u2019s well being.", "Yeah keep proving why you are the YTA. Hopefully your daughter goes no contact with you.", "Is your partner helping at all?", "It would indeed surprise me. I am always baffled that people are valuing their children so differently. Children of current partners often seem to be more valuable.", "from OPs comments, its vacuuming the house and picking up the other kid\u2019s toys", "Lol, what? What a dumb come back. Why would anyone have proof to a random stranger's daughter. It is OP's place to clarify why she thinks something she thinks.", "You didn\u2019t just ask a mother to produce proof of something related to her own daughter, claiming she\u2019s the one talking out of her ass \ud83e\udd23", "Just how much times is spent on these chores? I mean doing the dishes of one meal and setting the table is fine. However if you need to teach her chores doesn't mean she should have to do them every time she visits you.\n\nSit her down and tell her what worries you. That there's certain life skills she needs to learn and that you'll teach her those until she gets them down and then move onto something else.\n\nCooking together would definitely make it less of a chore.\n\nAnd most importantly after she learns these skills she won't have to do them at your house anymore. That this is purely to teach her the skills, not have her do endless chores all the time. Maybe do the chores outside of dishes and setting the table once a month and not every time she's over....", "Is your daughter Cinderella? Did she walk out of your womb perfectly able to deep clean a home and know what ratio of vinegar to water will clean a surface? \n\nShe\u2019s 14. She\u2019s barely had time to learn how to be a teenager and now your asking her to deep clean your house when she comes over the once or twice a month she is there. \n\nWhen she is no longer required to come to your house she will not be coming over anymore. \n\nYour not the kind of mom who preps her child for the world. Your the kind of mom who makes her minor child scrub the floors instead of spending what little time you have with her actually bonding and having fun. \n\nTell me, do you even know what your daughters hobbies are? What about which Jonas brother she likes the most? Or what her favorite coffee order is? Or does she like tea? \n\nThese where all things my mom knew when I was 14. I\u2019m 27 now and my mom knew me so well that when the Jonas brothers got back together she called me to share the news. \n\nYou are squandering your time with your daughter. For what appears to be a grudge about your ex getting primary custody.", "Please enlighten us as to what you consider \"spoiling\"?", "God you sound fucking terrible.  You actually sound like you HATE her.  You are beyond an asshole. \n\nIf I was her stepmom, I would spoil her too. In fact, if I was a stranger, I would spoil her. Because that\u2019s how sorry I feel for her right now.  She will have life long issues because she has a mother who not only didn\u2019t want her, but also thinks she shouldn\u2019t have fun with her.", "She shouldn\u2019t be doing anything other than washing the dishes for one meal and setting the table, she is only at your house once every two weeks, other household chores aren\u2019t suitable for her.", "Yup ! She wants the eldest daughter only for chores. She opted to dump her on dad and move on.", "After reading all her comments in this thread, it seems like she just has a new baby and a toddler and decided that her older daughter is too much so she let the dad have almost full custody. But she also doesn't think parents are supposed to be fun to their kids and just need to teach the kids on how to do chores, yikes...", "I got my 2.5 year old nephew to help me set and clear the table by making it into a game. Mostly just to keep him busy while his parents visited. Now every time he comes for family dinners he wants to play the \u201ctable game\u201d and gets sad when it\u2019s finished lol", "I haven\u2019t babysat in two whole ass decades and your post gave me the far off gaze of a Vietnam vet hearing Fortunate Son for the first time in years.", "I\u2019m 27 and I still sing the clean up song", "That makes the \u201cpreparing for the future\u201d comment make more sense.", "Yeah, I just saw that. Def NTA. OP is asking daughter to help when there, not parent, and it's not a big ask at that.", "I'm also a child of divorce and I hated it when my father did this kind of thing as if it would make him a better father. He used to try to make up for his absence by being a strict father, but this only pushed me further away from him.\n\nOP, you see your daughter twice in a month if you want to be a good mother do it in a way that doesn't create conflict in the upbringing that the father and stepmother give her, because if you think you can measure forces with them now, you'll lose. YTA.", "As much as I agree that she asks too much and should just spend quality time her, I do actually think cleaning and cooking are basic life skills everyone, no matter gender, should know.", "This makes so much sense. I bet she is having the older daughter clean up after the littlest ones.", "\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f", "i personally am a little iffy on the toys just because theyre for the *much younger* siblings and we have no idea how many toys/how often that is, but vacuuming is perfectly fine in my opinion"]}
