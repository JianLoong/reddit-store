I think as a parent it's my duty to prepare her for the future", "Because she is still a part of this family and because helping out your mom is a nice thing to do", "I let her father get custody because it was best for her. I sacrificed my time with her so that she can have a better life. I have a baby and a toddler and I couldn't handle another child while her dad only has one child", "Does it make a difference? The toys are for all my kids", "You don't need to worry about it. It's not like she does anything I tell her to do", "She only sees her once every two weekends as it is lol.\n\nOP will be more sad that she doesn't have someone to clean her house every couple of weeks than totally losing her daughter", "Yeah! Its a peculiar perspective on things.", "So you just assume they don't. You have no actual proof.", "Yes but that\u2019s not your entire role. You\u2019re supposed to be supportive, fun, helpful, caring and a good role model. It\u2019s fine to want to teach your kids manners, but you\u2019re not a strict teacher or something, you\u2019re her parent and you should want them to ENJOY staying with and seeing you.  \n\nIf I was your kid, I\u2019d hate going to your house.", "2/14 days don\u2019t constitute you as a parent. You dont have a say really because you arent part of the day to day. Parenting from the sidelines with not enough info is a recipe for disaster", "And in the future, the toilet she scrubs will be her own. The floors she mops will be her own. The furniture she dusts will be her own. She won\u2019t be going over to visit a friend and clean unless that friend is incapacitated and she\u2019s volunteering.", "But as THE PARENT WHO DOES NOT HAVE PRIMARY CUSTODY, why would you want to force anything onto your daughter that would limit her want to see you? IF anyone should be the \u201cfun parent,\u201d why wouldn\u2019t you want it to be you? Don\u2019t you want your daughter to want to see you???", "Being fun and preparing your child for the future aren't mutually exclusive. Your child is going to have a lot of resentment and not a lot of fond memories because of your outlook on this.", "Famous last words of every parent whose child goes no contact with them when they\u2019re adults. Get therapy and work out your own issues, honestly I doubt that will happen based on your reply\u2019s, but be prepared for her to cut you the FUCK off when she\u2019s 18.", "Preparing her for the future also means ensuring that she is able to live a good life and not one of drudgery. What are you doing in the other aspects of helping your child build a successful life filled with love, laughter, warmth and positive relationships?", "I think the fact you only have her once every two weekends, 4 days a month, says everything we need to know about you as a parent.", ">I don't think parents are supposed to be fun and exciting. I think as a parent it's my duty to prepare her for the future\n\nThis is your problem. You AREN'T the parent preparing her for her future. Parents are supposed to guide their children to adulthood - not treat them like household help. I'm not even sure why you have her at all when you aren't interested in fostering any kind of actual relationship with her...", "Wow so you don\u2019t value making meaningful memories with your daughter? YTA. and out of touch", "If living a life is only about doing chores and housework, what kind of life is this? I have a nice postcard from my sister to remind me of not taking everything so seriously. It says, live is not about the to-dos, but the ta-daas! With a nice parakeet picture. Maybe you need to be reminded of that as well.", "You have only 4 days a month with her currently. Once she is 16, she doesn\u2019t even need to see you if she doesn\u2019t want to.", "YTA and from personal experience, this is a great way to ensure that when she is able to choose whether or not to visit you, she won't. Seriously, rethink this in light that you arent even the primary parent.", "Helping without asking is nice. Being forced to do chores when you\u2019re visiting a divorced parent is not nice", "lol she has to pick the toys of her younger siblings/step siblings when she comes to your house ? Yeah hopefully you won't be part of HER family for too long. Worst case scenario only 4 years left.", "So do the other kids help you out to be nice. Or so you just expect your daughter to do it?", "It\u2019s no longer a nice thing to do if you\u2019re actively making her. YTA", "When was the last time you did something nice for your eldest? And I don't mean teaching chores.", "So you want her to help out her \u201cmom\u201d. And not just \u201clearn\u201d this stuff for her own good. That\u2019s probably why you ex is calling you an asshole.", "So you have a baby and a toddler, which would be newer children, and you tossed the older child aside and just use her for free household labor on your visitation weekends? Do I have that right?", "Well it's great that you want the best for her but from her perspective it could seem like you chose your baby and toddler over her and now you are making her clean up after them in the limited time you have with her. I really hope instead of being the parent you think you should be, you'd be an actually good parent", "OMG this explanation doesnt make you sound any better and in fact lends credit to the (correct) assumption made. You chose to skimp on parenting because you chose to have two more you couldnt handle and now want to try to parent a child that you essentially gave away.", "So you pose choosing your two younger children over your daughter as some kindness thing to her for giving her a better life with her dad, and then call her spoiled because she has an easy life with her dad? And now you're using your limited time with her to make her clean, instead of establishing yourself as a trusted parent she can turn to? \n\nYou didn't sacrifice your time. You sacrificed your daughter's time with her mother. And now that she only has four days a month, you're sacrificing that time further by making her clean a house she barely lives in. If you were my mom, I know how I would feel.", "So you abandoned her and now expect her to go clean your house?? Got it. Ffs hire a maid, spend your time with the kids you actually like, and leave that poor girl alone!", "Was your daughter with you until you had the wee ones? Did you send her away because three kids are too many?", "That decision wasn\u2019t for her, it sounds like it was for you because you can\u2019t handle how many kids you have. Why doesn\u2019t she see you every weekend? No good parent has this little time with their kid", "So essentially you want her to parent your other children got it. YTA. Cannot wait until your daughter goes no contact and you blame her father. \ud83d\ude44", "Shes fucking Cinderella.", "So you see your abandoned child once every two weeks, make them come over and clean up after your new replacement family, and you think you're being a good parent? \n\nSpoiler alert: you're not, lol", "\u201cHey kid, go live with your dad so I can start a new family without you!\u201d  YTA.  Enjoy your every other weekend while you can because when she\u2019s old enough to say no you won\u2019t see her.", "So you had two more children when you don't have time/money for your first? Then your solution was to only use her as unpaid help when you do see her?", "Why didn\u2019t you put this in your post ? That you have a baby and toddler , so when your daughter comes over 4 days a month, you basically use her as slave labor for you and your new family.", "So you had 2 other kids and took their priority instead of not having them and looking after the one you already had?", "Because I\u2019m sure your teenager plays with blocks and the See n Say", "Yes, it does. You only see her twice a month, yet you think she should spend that 'quality time' picking up after your kids, the ones you could be arsed with? That's your job.", "I find it hard to believe a 14 year old teenager is playing with the same toys as her younger siblings.", "You are the one that asked for an opinion.", "comes to the internet for judgement, gets judged harshly  #surprised pikachu face", "Screw you", "well you brought it here, not going the way you thought is it?", "Girl why the hell are you here then", "My proof is the fact that she hardly knows how to do these", "I think she already did.", "I didn't realize a toddler and baby sbould help me cleam", "Bingo. No wonder homegirl doesn\u2019t want to play Cinderella to mom\u2019s new kids.", "she's 14 even if she does whatever \"those things\" are at home she is definitely not a master maid at them. The point of giving chores is to teach them not transform your kids in little helpers...", "As a child of divorce, I was never asked to do any chores when I spent a few hours with my other parent every other weekend. Nobody wants to bond with their parents over cleaning. And guess what? Your daughter doesn\u2019t need to know how to do these things. If she wants to learn, she will. She doesn\u2019t have to. Stop trying to force stereotypes on her and try being a Mom", "Okay. Now I understand it, you're trying to ease her into parentification.", "My toddlers \u201chelped\u201d pick up their toys. We made a game out of it. There is actually a pick up song about it.", "Youre right they dont. Also,  cleaning up after your other kids is not your daughter's job.", "You are using her as free labor when she comes over 4 days a month. Like a maid for you and your new kids.", "OP is definitely TA. bonding over making meals together, packing lunches, having a laundry party, gardening, most chores can be fun when the relationship is solid. When you barely see your child, your time is precious and you make the most of it."]}
