Two wrongs don't make a right.", "I get why you did it, but I\u2019m going to be brutally honest with you about what\u2019s happening here; These people saying N T A are just living vicariously through you and enjoying the idea of revenge. They\u2019ve been body-shamed too and they\u2019re mad. They get pleasure imagining this kid being hurt the way they\u2019ve been hurt. Here\u2019s my take as a 26 year old who has been through similar scenarios a million times:\n\nWhat he did was wrong not only because it insulted you personally, but because it was offensive to all women. It perpetuated the sort of cruel body-shaming that we all experience throughout our lives that results in people hating themselves even when they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Even if you get over it there were other people who heard him who will also be hurt by it. He\u2019s a major asshole for that. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing though\u2014you did the same thing. You didn\u2019t just insult him. You insulted every boy that heard you. And you contributed to their negative body-image. This is the sort of thing that cuts deep. Maybe you didn\u2019t direct the insult at the other boys, but you reinforced the idea that girls are valuing them (or not) based on that. And that\u2019s incredibly sad for them. \n\nUltimately, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. This one kid might\u2019ve deserved a taste of his own medicine, but that doesn\u2019t make it okay to do. You were young and I wouldn\u2019t hold it against you, but in adulthood you should try to rise above this sort of thing instead of engaging with it. \n\nSide note\u2014a comparison that I think clarifies this phenomenon for a lot of people would be the n-word. No matter how evil a black person is, it\u2019s never okay to call them the n-word. That\u2019s because you\u2019re not insulting their behavior, you\u2019re insulting their identity. By doing so you insult ALL black people. Use this comparison as a test in the future for whether what you\u2019re about to say is actually fair game. If it\u2019s going to hurt more than just the deserving target, don\u2019t do it. \n\nESH", "NTA\n\nDid he get the same treatment?

If he can't take it, he shouldn't be dishing it out. He was being a bully and you tried to shut him down. It's so easy for teachers to say \"sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me\" but let's be honest - they do hurt.
