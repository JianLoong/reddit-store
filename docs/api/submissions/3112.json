I was named after my Uncle Nate, but my family accepted my change.  Except for my dad's mother, Florence (and, no, I will not be calling her \"grandmother\" because... reasons).  Florence had a hard time adjusting to my name change, so my parents said to gently remind people of my preferred name.  She accidently called me Nate one time and I gave a gentle reminder.

Funny story I never told my wife, it took me years to say our daughters name correctly (I had to say it slowly and practice it).
