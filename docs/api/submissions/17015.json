His claim/excuse of: \n\n>\"we\" came easier to me\n\nmakes absolutely no sense, there's no reason that should be an automatic response and it really points toward OP having a certain mindset about the situation that is FAR from completely neutral. I'd bet big money there's more behind the story, and though I agree the friend is sensitive her reaction points to the same thing too. \n\nIf the word use really was completely neutral, none of the above could even be considered, especially by OP's friend, yet here we are.", "That was my thought, too. I've had neighbors ask if I need anything from the grocery store, but never anything about furniture. \n\nOP, could your friend have a more serious relationship with the neighbor than you realize, or is she interested in them romantically?

There's a decent likelihood OP would have ended up going to the store as well. When I'm with my friends and their plans change, I usually end up going with them. The alternative would be OP leaving her friend's house early or just sitting alone in her friend's house for who knows how long.
