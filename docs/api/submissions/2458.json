The fact that you are vengeful enough in your anger to do that says a lot more about you than lazy Daniel.", "NTA.  Minus points for not being a little more diplomatic in language, but daniel did not contribute anything.  Teacher is out of line for they way they addressed this.  If you told her in advance that he did nothing, she should have handled his question.\n\nIf your school system permits this, you might consider bringing this to their attention.  Teacher failed to ensure a healthy learning environment for the three of you.", "Uh, NTA. I wouldn\u2019t put his name on it either. If the teacher is so worried about his precious, delicate feelings, she can call him a whambulance.", "Fuuuuuck no! you are in no means TAH. The teacher and Daniel are AH. Not you, innocent one. You made a group decision to keep his name off the slide, which was warranted, you told your teacher and all she cared about was poor useless daniels feelings? Honey, if anyone calls you an AH, ask them if they'd be okay with Daniels behavior", "NTA no work no credit", "Nta I would have added his name in a white font on a\nWhite background. I don\u2019t believe in non participation trophies", "In my opinion, it's better to be straight forward. In university I've had several group projects where it was one submission (and one grade) for the whole group, and I would shamelessly go up to professors with the group members who participated to tell the prof if a group member didn't do anything or ignored all communication. Most professors will remove that person from the group because they agree that it's not fair for a non participating member to profit off the rest of the group.", "My grad school program was big on group projects, but they also always included a survey at the end as to who participated and to what extent.  In one class, we had one classmate very upset with our group because she did not participate at all in a project that was half of the grade for the class and the other three of us in the group put her down as such on the survey.    It was her first semester and she apparently did not know about the surveys.   \n\nWithin that system, I was okay with group work.   You could always do it yourself if you wanted, but when everyone knew they were accountable for their effort,  people could to play to their strengths and get help with their weaknesses.", "yeah, i sorta feel like this was the better option. with this teacher it may have made no difference but possibly.\n\nor started it with we will each go over the parts of the project that we handled- and daniel just has nothing to go over.", "That is true. He brought this on himself.", "If a goal for school is to prepare you for the real world, then group projects absolutely have their place imo."]}
