We have two children together ages 12Brin(f) 9Malachi.  I have a 15 year old daughter Emma from a previous relationship. My ex and I co parent Emma, and my ex has Emma on the weekends.\n\nAll my children are very involved with dance. They take dance classes 3 classes a week. They all started very young. Emma though has a special talent for dancing, she\u2019s been taking classes since she was 4, and started competitive dance at 7. She takes 3 classes a week along with her siblings, but then private lessons during  the weekend. \n\nEmma is a straight A student, but recently her grades have been down to a c. She had gotten a 60% on one of her core class test.  I gave her a warning and said she needed to get her grades up. I offered her a tutor and she refused. I had a meeting with her teacher on what she needed to do to get her grades up. The teacher gave her some extra credit work.\n\n I check her grades against this week, 2 of her classes are down to a c, and one of her electives was a low B. Like I said before this is very unlike my daughter, she has straight A\u2019s always have been. She\u2019s in one advance class. My husband and I spoke and decided it was best to take her out of dance for the time being and get her a tutor. Emma was super upset and said it\u2019s unfair she\u2019s been training her whole life and they have a competition in may. I told her education comes first. She called her dad to come pick her up and she\u2019s stayed there that night.\n\nHer father is outraged because he agrees she\u2019s been training her whole life and my husband shouldn\u2019t of had a say in that decision, him and I should\u2019ve, and that he helps pay for these classes as well. \n\nTonight she was very upset that her siblings got to go class and she didn\u2019t, and told her dad to nag me. He said it\u2019s not fair because Malachi and Brin don\u2019t have straight A\u2019s and a tutor so they shouldn\u2019t be in dance either. I told him They aren\u2019t straight A students like Emma, and don\u2019t take as many classes as Emma so they have time for a tutor.", "created_utc": 1676492903, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1137o9e/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_out_of_dance_class/", "score": 298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And that dance is the problem?", "YTA. You have double standards when it comes to kids, you did not ask Emma why her grades went down, instead you made a demand and didn\u2019t even warn her that you will take her out of the dance class.\n\nMore than that, you didn\u2019t even consult with Emma\u2019s dad about it. He did have a right to participate in this discussion. \n\nYou need to mend things.", "YTA for two reasons:\n\n1. Your ex is absolutely right that he should have been involved with this decision if you all are co-parenting.\n\n2. Research suggests that extra curricular activities help academics, not detract from them. If your daughter has been dancing her whole life and is only now getting poor grades it probably isn\u2019t the dancing. I would spend some more energy figuring out why she isn\u2019t getting the same grades and not strip her of her passion.", "Have you asked Emma about why her grades are dropping? Maybe it\u2019s nothing to do with dancing and she\u2019s bullied or something else that taking her out of her dance class (which she clearly loves) won\u2019t help", "YTA. \n\nHave you actually tried to find out why her grades have dropped? She could be being bullied or be having mental health issues, and punishing her isn\u2019t going to help.", "YTA. You should have coparented and talked with Emma's dad, not just your husband. Did you even give him a heads up about her grades in the first place? Also, you assume it's time but you need to dig deeper and find out why, not just punish her.", "INFO\n\nI'm missing the point in your rant about grades and dance where you actually talked with your 15 year old daughter and asked her what was going on with her grades. Not just \"you got bad grades, you need a tutor\", but an actual conversation.\n\nIs she struggling with understanding the content? Is she not completing the homework? Why have her grades dropped?", "INFO: \n\n* Have you asked your daughter what is going on? What did she say?\n* How was her participation in dance affecting her grades? Or did you pull her out to punish her?\n* You say her grades went down \"recently\" to a \"C\" but then say that only two weeks later you expected her grades to have improved. Additionally, you wrote that only two of her classes were a C and an elective was a B, so it seems her grades either have improved or she is only struggling in a couple classes. Please show your math.", "YTA because you didn\u2019t communicate with your daughter first before making a sweeping decision. She\u2019s 15, not 5. Plus, you still don\u2019t really know why her grades dropped, and you just punished her for it. I wouldn\u2019t be totally against scaling back the extracurricular activities, but she needs to know that it\u2019s related to her poor schoolwork, and that she can earn them back. Even then, this is a risky move if your daughter is dealing with something like anxiety or depression, because you just removed her greatest outlet for stress. This is not how to go about this. You need to sit down and talk, and get to the bottom of the change in her behavior.", "YTA.  Kids who stay in sports and extra curricular activities typically do better in school.  Removing her from a class where she excels, gets exercise and reduces stress was a bad move.  There isn\u2019t any correlation between dance and grades that I see here, so why not get her a tutor and keep something that makes her happy too?  And yes, you should have spoken to her father about it first.  Coparenting fail.", "YTA. You\u2019re holding your daughter to a higher standard than your other kids. Either they all have to be straight A students to get to be involved in dance or none of them do.", "Info\n\nIf she intends on being a dancer stopping her training isn't temporary punishment. It's changing the rest of her life. So does she intend on being a dancer? Have you asked her what's going on in her life that's caused the change in her grades?", "YTA.\n\nYou are basically punishing your daughter for being a human being and favoring your other children for being worse students on average.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make sense at all.", "YTA. You & her father should have discussed what was going on before making a decision. She\u2019s been in dance her whole life & you took away something that she cares deeply about without having an actual conversation with her or her dad.\n\nYou said that this is not like your daughter so maybe there is something else going on at school or in her life & instead of punishing her you could try to talk to her & get to the root of the problem.", "YTA \n\nI wish parents would stop obsessing and punishing their kids for average grades. Taking away something she\u2019s been doing almost her whole life and does regularly is going to have a detrimental effect rather than a positive one.\n\nThis was such a short sighted and poor decision", "YTA you gave her a week and a half to raise her grades, wow you're so kind, i actually can't believe how cruel you're being to your daughter, c's and b's aren't failing grades it's unfair to your daughter", "Did you even talk to your daughter about what\u2019s been happening in her life to affect her grades? Did you just jump to taking away something she enjoys?

Whatever reason there is for her grades slipping, it's not her dance class. I'd suggest you get off her back about her grades and start thinking about her quality of life. Help her get her head in a good place and I'm sure the grades will follow, or not. It's not the end of the world.", "Have you talked to Emma and asked her why her grades are lower now? Maybe something has changed, and she needs to talk. She probably won't talk to you now since you've taken away something she loves and is good at without talking first.", "Yta- In a comment you said you gave your daughter a week and a half to get grades up\u2026that is not how that works. It could take a month or more to actually see any improvement in grades with how the grading scale works. Your also the asshole for involving only your husband but not her biological father that one you are actually co parenting with. Do better.", "Yes, you are one.\u00a0High school is difficult, and a lot of students go through burnout, and taking her out of a class she enjoys makes it worse.\u00a0It is common for all students to start doing worse in their education in high school, especially in the ninth grade. In addition, she might start doing worse in school out of protest. I also agree with your ex that it is unfair that she has to get all A to do what she wants to do while the other kid isn\u2019t. Plus, colleges began to look at people's extracurricular activities more than their grades, and if you truly believe she can excel in dancing, then let her continue it.\u00a0", "YTA\n\n\"her siblings got to go class and she didn\u2019t,....They aren\u2019t straight A students like Emma, and don\u2019t take as many classes as Emma so they have time for a tutor\"\n\nOk so they take fewer classes than Emma, have a tutor AND STILL DON'T GET STRAIGHT A's, but still go to dance.\n\nDamn. Emma doesn't have a chance compared to them, does she?\n\nOffer to do away with a couple of non academic classes, if Emma agrees, if it will raise her average. \n\nYou need to understand that 15 and 16 is the age when teachers begin raising their standards and rules. She is no longer a middle schooler but gearing toward high school and there is a period of adjustment.\n\n I was a straight A student in a high powered academic program from kindergarten until high school. I unexpectedly got my very first d's. It took me a couple of terms to get accustomed to the grading system and lingo, and I was able to get back into the swing of things. Math was my one hurdle. It was a legit case of the teacher having a grudge against me, all the other students could see it. She randomly picked someone every few years, and made their life hell, covertly.\n\nI'd ask if that were the problem, but you wouldn't know. Maybe it's time for Emma to live with her dad until her grades come up, and she can come back and visit when the grades suit you? I wonder if the stress of having to be exceptional to the other kids is getting to her.", "I loved choir. My mom took it away when my grades declined. I didn\u2019t get better grades because choir was not the issue. The issue was ADD. All I learned was that my mom could take away anything that I loved at any moment because I wasn\u2019t good enough to keep it. \n\nI withdrew from school because I was depressed and had nothing to look forward to. All my friends were in choir so my friendships suffered and I stopped sharing things with my mom cause she\u2019d just use them against me. \n\nI think you\u2019re coming from a caring place but you are wrong. Your current husband doesn\u2019t have an equal say to her actual father. Your teen daughter has too many obligations and you take away the one she enjoys rather than figuring out how to lighten her load in a way that keeps her engaged. Now her burdens are the same and her relief is lessened. Oh, and the cherry on top? Her younger siblings are already underperforming in comparison so naturally they don\u2019t get the same punishment because what, you already expect less of them? YTA", "YTA...co-parenting means you make these decisions in consultation with her father.", "YTA \n\nYou discussed and agreed on it with the wrong person.

It was not right to dole out a punishment and expect her father to back you up without even giving him a say first.", "YTA - for basically the way you\u2019ve handled the entire situation. There is something major wrong in your daughter\u2019s life. For whatever reason, she obviously does not feel comfortable talking to you about it. Rather than doing the work to figure out what it is, you are taking the easy way and just punishing her. You need to seriously get your head out of your ass and figure out, what is causing your daughter to have problems with her schoolwork. If I had to guess, I would think maybe she\u2019s being bullied; my second guess would probably be that she is being sexually abused by someone. The situation is almost certainly a lot more serious than how you\u2019re taking it. \n\nAnd I agree with your ex, it is absolutely not your and your current husband\u2019s call to pull her out of her dance classes.", "Info:\n\nDid you ask her why she felt her grades were slipping?", "Op, actually TALK to your daughter. Ask her why her grades are slipping and how you can help her out. \n\nMaybe she's depressed, maybe she's burnt out. \n\nTaking her out of dance class is not going to help in the slightest, it will make her resent you.", "Soft YTA. If your daughter is going through something, and dance is the one outlet that she has, you may be shooting yourself to the foot. I also have a teenager, so I totally get that sometimes you have to use what you have, but I do try not to interfere with my teen's mental health. Instead of a whole bunch of tutoring, why not take her to a therapist and see if there's a reason why her grades have suddenly tanked? Edit to add vote.", "YTA.  She was a straight A student and now she\u2019s not and you think the problem is too much dance?  Or is taking her out of dance just punishment for having a problem you\u2019re all ignoring that has effected her grades?  She has a BIG problem. You\u2019re ignoring it and not discussing it.", "YTA- I\u2019m a dance teacher who sees things like this often. \n1) he ABSOLUTELY should have had a say and not your husband. If it effects things at his house, he should get a say. \n2) By just taking her out of classes, right during competitive season, how do you think that helps the rest of the team? It doesn\u2019t. They are now left to throw extra practices to make up for her not being there. \n3) maybe Emma would be back to a straight A student if she wasn\u2019t in so many dance classes.", "YTA for making this decision without talking about it with Emma's father.\n\nIn terms of Emma herself, I think you're mildly the ah but only because this strategy isn't going to play out the way you think it will. You see dance as a distraction from school, even though you say she was always a straight A student and has been dancing her whole life so clearly it was never an issue until right now.\n\nTaking away the think she loves is not going to motivate her to perform better academically. If anything she'll just lose hope in both dance *and* school. Find out what else is going on as to why she suddenly isn't balancing dance and school when she used to. She's also at an age where social relationships, social media, and peer pressure tend to be a distraction from education, so that might be a fine place to start.", "I was with you until it was mentioned the other kids don't have perfect grades. \n\nYTA. Figure out why her grades are dropping. \n\nKeeping her from dancing isn't going to encourage her to keep her grades up if you let the others dance.", "YTA - This is a co parenting decision with her bio Dad.  Have you actually talked to your daughter to see why her grades have slipped.  Taken her to a counselor?  Clearly, something is going on.", "YTA instead of trying to help your daughter you are punishing her. Maybe something is happening and you just ignore it because \"she is an A student\"", "YTA - while I understand meeting your children where they are, and not putting undue pressure on them to accomplish things that are outside of their capabilities, it sounds like you\u2019re putting an immense amount of pressure on Emma while your other two children get to do so so. \n\nIn conjunction with that your husband is allowing his children\u2019s mediocrity, and rewarding it with continued dance class, while Emma is punished by being removed for having the same grades? That doesn\u2019t sound right. \n\nYour ex is right that this decision should\u2019ve been made between the two of you and not with your current husband.\n\nYour ex isn\u2019t nagging you, he is standing up for his child because you and your husband are treating her unfairly.", "My sister in law did something similar. She was very negative. Her children no longer speak to her. Sounds like you have a really good kid. You are not being a great mom. Find out what is going on. Dance may be the only positive in her life at the moment. You also affect the other people involved if she has a competition coming up. Do not be mean and lazy. Figure it out. Be better.", "YTA Taking away her passion that she has spent her life pursuing and perfecting because her academics aren't at the level you want doesn't even make sense. How do the 2 correlate?  You are punishing her rather than motivating her. At what point are you going to be a parent and figure out why she started to slip in her grades instead of threatening and manipulating her into deceiving the grades you deem worthy? Your ex, your daughter, and now reddit see you playing favorites and treating your daughter poorly. Be better.", "YTA YTA YTA\n\nim so glad i dont have a mother like you", "YTA- seems like rather then finding out WHY she isnt doing well in class you just went wild and pulled her from dance class.\n\nNot all students do well all the time. B grade is FINE. You have vastly different rules for each child which sets a bad taste in my mouth. The others should need A's as well. \n\nYou are also the AH for not talking to your ex about this.

I told him They aren\u2019t straight A students like Emma\"\n\nJust for this alone, YTA.  You hold Emma to higher expectations than the other children, then punish her when she doesn't meet those higher expectations.  This is blatantly unfair to Emma.  Also, she was obviously able to balance straight A's and dance classes before, so this recent drop in grades isn't about the dancing.  And, with taking her dance away--removing a passion of hers that she's invested so much in--she's likely to become depressed and do worse in school as a result.  This was the wrong call.", "YTA. She\u2019s literally getting \u201caverage\u201d grades and being punished for it, and by missing a big competition she\u2019s been working hard for. Double-standard with your kids much? \n\nGrades are important, but there are SO many steps you could have taken before deciding on this punishment, especially without warning. How about telling her that she needs to raise her grades OR she\u2019ll have to cut back on the number of dance lessons per week?", "YTA but not a big one. Please don\u2019t take away what a teenager loves. They are emotional and all over the place and she will resent you for this. \n\nThere must be a reason why her grades are down. Giving her warnings and forcing her away from what she\u2019s passionate about will do nothing to make her grades better (honestly it\u2019ll probably make them worse). Have a heart to heart with her. Not as a mother but as a friend, to find out why her grades are declining. But please for the love of God let her dance. It\u2019s not the end of the world because she got a couple C\u2019s.", "Yta.  Talk to her.", "YTA for not discussing with her dad first. Also, I understand your intentions, but I think taking her out of dance is a terrible move. Extracurriculars and exercise are so good for kids. Why not threaten to take her phone or something else? \n\nAlso, to ease your mind a bit, I think it's super common for grades to start slipping around this age. I'm not saying you should accept it, but just thought I'd throw that out there that hopefully it's a phase. I was a straight A student til I hit 13. I got back to straight A's around 16.l and so many of my friend's kids are going through the same thing.", "YTA. It seems like Emma is excellent at both dance and school. Why do you deprive her of her passion for dance? Yes, her grades slipped significantly, but you\u2019re lenient with your other children in that regard. You\u2019re expecting Emma to drop her passion in order to keep her A status. That tells her that you don\u2019t have faith in her as a dancer and that must hurt her a lot. If you really support your daughter and listen to her, you\u2019d be able to 1) understand why her grades slipped and 2) compromise on Bs maybe and help her get there without taking dance away from her.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not fair to a child to introduce arbitrary punishments.  You didn't clearly set out these expectations before the school year.\n\nMost likely the problem is not that dance is taking up too much time.  It's that she is doing other things instead of studying.", "YTA big time Your ex is right", "I would call her father and first find out what is going on. If it is because she isn\u2019t doing her work, take away the phone, have her do her work in the kitchen, it might be the work is harder, she could be depressed, she could be in love, ect.

Big time.", "YTA. Have you had any conversations with your daughter about why her grades are slipping? Nothing you've said indicates it's dance lessons taking up too much of her time, since she's always been in dance and was an A student before.

If she has been dancing that long and her grades are only suffering recently, then the dancing isn't the cause. Chances are you are only making whatever she is going through worse by taking away the outlet she clearly loves. Also, if you coparent with her dad you need to include him in the discussion of stopping an activity she has been competing in for years and working hard for, which he has also invested time and money in.\n\nIf she won't tell you what is wrong, talk to her teachers and figure out if her struggling is due to not doing homework, failing exams and quizzes, or several things. Get her in to talk to a counselor or therapist and figure out if she has symptoms of depression or ADD/ ADHD. Take the initiative to sign her up with a tutor if she really is just struggling with the material. She isn't just having trouble in school for no reason, and it is your job as a parent to figure out why and help her. \n\nApologize for taking away dance and explain that you will let her go back, but that you need to figure out how to improve her grades and why she is struggling as well.

This will backfire. \n\nI was a ballet dancer growing up and I LOVED it, I did great in school and wanted to be a professional dancer but I always wanted to go to college too. When I got to high school I had some typical dramatic teenage girl friend issues and my grades dropped for the first time. My parents immediately cut off ballet and got me a tutor and I officially stopped caring about school. I knew what I needed and I knew what I wanted, but I was 16 and hormonal and hurting. I lashed out at my parents for it and they punished me harder. School was still just as awful, my grades didn\u2019t get better because the problem was still there, the only difference was that they cut off my access to something that gave me real passion, and friends. I lost my drive and never got to see my friends, I started hanging around bad kids at school because I felt like a fuckup. \n\nMaybe this seems like a dramatic reaction to some, but I was a teenager being bullied and I lost my perfect grades and my chance at ballet. I shut down a lot and ended up getting involved with bad people because my parents didn\u2019t listen to me. After a while, they realized things had gotten nothing but worse and one day when I got home they were excitedly sitting at the table. They let me know that even with C\u2019s and B\u2019s, they were ready to get me back into ballet. It had been nearly a year after over a decade of ballet. I do clearly remember laughing and crying at the same time in response. I yelled at my parents for the first time about how they don\u2019t get to yank me around like a doll and that if they seriously thought I could jump back into ballet like it was nothing they were insane. I told them how they left me no access to train or stay in ballet shape, how I couldn\u2019t keep up and that I was mocked enough at school so why would I go try and start over fresh at the studio to get the same treatment? I told them they clearly knew what was best so far, don\u2019t bother changing now and I was almost done with all of this anyways so just don\u2019t worry about their precious, perfect image. \n\nThe kicker here is that my brother had guitar lessons and was always funded without trouble even tho he never did as good at school as me.

We have two children together ages 12Brin(f) 9Malachi.  I have a 15 year old daughter Emma from a previous relationship. My ex and I co parent Emma, and my ex has Emma on the weekends.\n\nAll my children are very involved with dance. They take dance classes 3 classes a week. They all started very young. Emma though has a special talent for dancing, she\u2019s been taking classes since she was 4, and started competitive dance at 7. She takes 3 classes a week along with her siblings, but then private lessons during  the weekend. \n\nEmma is a straight A student, but recently her grades have been down to a c. She had gotten a 60% on one of her core class test.  I gave her a warning and said she needed to get her grades up. I offered her a tutor and she refused. I had a meeting with her teacher on what she needed to do to get her grades up. The teacher gave her some extra credit work.\n\n I check her grades against this week, 2 of her classes are down to a c, and one of her electives was a low B. Like I said before this is very unlike my daughter, she has straight A\u2019s always have been. She\u2019s in one advance class. My husband and I spoke and decided it was best to take her out of dance for the time being and get her a tutor. Emma was super upset and said it\u2019s unfair she\u2019s been training her whole life and they have a competition in may. I told her education comes first. She called her dad to come pick her up and she\u2019s stayed there that night.\n\nHer father is outraged because he agrees she\u2019s been training her whole life and my husband shouldn\u2019t of had a say in that decision, him and I should\u2019ve, and that he helps pay for these classes as well. \n\nTonight she was very upset that her siblings got to go class and she didn\u2019t, and told her dad to nag me. He said it\u2019s not fair because Malachi and Brian don\u2019t have straight A\u2019s and a tutor so they shouldn\u2019t be in dance either. I told him They aren\u2019t straight A students like Emma, and don\u2019t take as many classes as Emma so they have time for a tutor.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

First, because the punishment was chosen and enforced without the support of BOTH of her parents. Second, because the punishment was enforced before even allowing your child a chance to improve. Third, I also believe the punishment doesn't fit the crime.

Your ex is right\u2014the discussion should have been between you and your ex, not you and your current husband. And it is possible that the decline in grades is not due to her dance.

I was the straight A student who always was punished for less than an A with siblings who were rewarded for acheiving the bare minimum. I have virtually no relationship with my parents as a result. Who wants one with people who care more about using my grades as their bragging point to the detriment of their own daughter. \n\nGive her back her dance as an after school activity since she is notwhere near failling and actually ASK HER WHAT'S GOING ON. Idk why you assume a girl who has danced her entire life with straight As has a time issue or suddenly needs tutors out of nowhere and not that she's struggling with something else going on in her life (You know, like bullying, ostracization within her household or within her peers, etc) that's making her deprioritize her school.", "I was a straight A student most of my childhood. I started to get Bs and Cs in high school primarily due to the bullying at school.\n\nMy parents took me out of a trip to France I\u2019d earned via my hard work (just like your daughter earned her place in her dance program.) and I lost all motivation I had to do well.

Maybe something is going on. Hey if you take her out of class take the other 2 out too since they don\u2019t have A\u2019s.", "YTA for making one child get straight As to dance and not the others. Your ex is also correct he should have been involved in this situation not your current husband as he doesn't have a say.", "Nothing that you\u2019ve said indicates that dancing is making her grades drop, you\u2019ve already said she\u2019s a straight A student and she\u2019s been dancing for years, did you even consider that it could be something ese? did you ask her if anything was going on at school? It could literally be anything, I would say YTA for just immediately jumping to conclusions, not really having an open dialogue with Emma or her father who also pays for the classes, but most of all, for showing Emma that you treat her differently than her siblings, I think that\u2019s quite hurtful and you could have handled this differently. I think your actions will be more detrimental to her grades than her continuing dance.\n\nAlso, from her perspective you\u2019ve now put pressure on her that she has to get A\u2019s, and you can\u2019t always hold her to that standard because she\u2019s human too, of course grades are important but they\u2019re not everything, school can be stressful enough, I went to a school that put pressure on students to get A\u2019s and anything less than that was seen as a failure, it really really sucks!

Why can they dance without being a straight A student", "It sounds like she's holding them to the same standards, which is that they do their best. It doesn't sound like her other kids have ever been capable of straight A's so requiring that they earn them would be unreasonable.

Has she been spending more time than usual in dancing related activities? Have you tried helping her?

If the reason she had a few bad grades really is she is stressed for a competition,  perhaps because she is reaching a higher level of dance that is more involved and time consuming, then the answer isn't to take away dance. Instead OP should provide her with the support she needs to succeed in both, as she is clearly passionate about it and has successfully balanced dance and school until recently.\n\nFor example, give her a chance to do as she said and improve her grades, with a reasonable timeline of a month or two. Communicate clearly that if she doesn't know whether she can do that on her own, you will get her a tutor to help. Also make it clear that if there is no improvement to by the end of the communicated time, the three of you (OP, Dad, daughter) will have a sit down discussion about what is going on and what to do, including options like cutting back on the number of competitions or temporarily stopping dance.

They've designed their entire program around specific dancers, and you have ruined that because your daughter needs help, not punishment.", "Depending on the assignments and the weight of the assignments on her grade, it could take more than a week and a half. Tests often count more than homework. She may need a really good test score for a grade boost before you will see significant improvement in her grades. Also, the more she advances in school, the tougher the material is going to be, and she may not be comprehending everything and is trying to learn on her own without a tutor.

I definitely think mom needs to do more investigating before giving consequences, but saying she has double standards for her kids is inaccurate. Expecting each kid to do their best is not double standards. All kids are not the same, so their best won't be the same, so you can't have the same expectations. If mom investigates and finds out that, in fact, her daughter is going through something and is no longer capable of getting A's, then she would be unreasonable to expect her to continue getting them. Lots of kids (myself included around that age) start getting distracted by things like a social life or they simply stop enjoying putting in the effort to earn the A's. While this isn't the case for every kid, it could be for this one. That's why more investigating needs to be done. Either way, I don't agree with taking her out of dance class.

Occasionally marks will dip a bit but we don\u2019t punish them, we talk to them to find out what is going on with them. There are all kinds of reasons why grades might drop, and maybe time management is part of the issue but you talk to your daughter and you figure it out, you don\u2019t just decide it\u2019s dance.

She has plenty of time to train after she gets her grades back up.", "YTA for one very specific reason to me. You never asked your daughter why her grades are down, you assumed it\u2019s bc she doesn\u2019t have enough time to study and acted on the assumption.

There could be something bigger going on that she probably doesn't know how to deal with or talk about, and you've chosen to punish her further by taking away something she clearly enjoys. 100% YTA, and you'll be lucky if this doesn't damage your relationship with her permanently.", "YTA.  Find out what the root of the issue is.  Taking away the one thing she loves is not helpful.", "YTA for favoring your younger daughters over her.

You're hurting your daughter and I think you're happy that she's hurting. Shame on you.", "YTA.\n\nSchool sucks and it\u2019s hard to care about it sometimes.

If they do not have to have perfect grades to attend dance, your eldest shouldn't either. Also, highly doubtful that dance is actually the problem, especially if shes maintained her grades all along. Taking her out of dance when it's only been a couple weeks (not at all long enough to turn that grade around, especially if teachers dont update grades regularly) was not cool, especially if shes been training for a competition. Also, your ex is right. Your current husband has no say in how to punish your child that your co-parenting with your ex. Sure he can give you an opinion, but the decision should be between you and the ex. If you dont make this right, your going to damage your relationship with your kid.", "YTA for holding your children to different standards, but also for apparently not asking your daughter what changed in her life that is causing her grades to slip. You seem concerned with appearances but not with the mental health of your child.", "YTA\n\nHave you bothered asking her what's going on? Clearly something has affected her to lose focus on school. Did you think just telling her to bring the grades up would magically do that? Like, your job here is done? A tutor isn't going to help if the issue isn't the coursework.\n\nThis is lazy parenting.

This ends up resulting in the assumption that if a kid isn't behaving the way you want them to, they're doing it on purpose, and you have to make the misbehavior unpleasant enough that they'll get back in line. In fact, misbehaving kids are very rarely doing it just because they feel like it. As a parent, you need to first and foremost give your kid the tools to make a better decision, and that starts with figuring out why they're making bad ones in the first place.\n\nOP, talk to your daughter about what's going on with her grades.
