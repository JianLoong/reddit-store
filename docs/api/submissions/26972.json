This was the 90s and things weren't as expensive as they are today, but still I had to plan showers,  parties and all those dresses, shoes, hair and makeup, gifts, etc. I went into credit card debt and took most of my 20s to crawl out of it. Don't do that. You have enough on your plate supporting your bf and college!", "\u201cI\u2019d love to help, but it will take some time for me to save that much money. I\u2019ll need you to delay your wedding for 7 years.\u201d", "But why on the world would you, a college student, merely 18 yo, help your spoiled entitled sister to pay for her extravagant dress?   \nIn your situation, IMO, the sister should help you as a maid of honour and buy a dress for you.   \nShe is completely detached from reality.  \nNTA, of course.", "Why not 50%?", "Ahhh now I see why your sister pulled this. People think you're going to do anything they want.", "You\u2019re the MOH and you don\u2019t even know when the wedding is? \n\nWhat is going *on* over there", "Gotcha. Either way, you\u2019re not responsible for paying for her dress. She is.", "Saying no is not rude. Here\u2019s the thing. Anytime you say no\u2026you\u2019re going to upset her. There are no magic words that exist to make irrational people more rational. You can talk until you\u2019re blue in the face and it wouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nLook at it like this:\n\nIf you say no, she\u2019s upset\n\nIf you say yes, she\u2019s happy\u2026but then you won\u2019t have any money to support yourself. \n\nHow\u2019s that going to work?  How are you going to pay your rent?  How are you going to pay your bills?", "There are multiple \u201cperfect\u201d dresses out there for everyone. The idea that there is exactly One Perfect Dress for every bride is a complete myth. \n\nWedding dresses come in just about every cut and fabric and style and color a person can dream up. And oftentimes, there are more affordable comps of high-end designer dresses floating around - very few designs stay 100% unique, especially if they\u2019re popular/trendy. If the dress she loves has specific features that appeal to her, she can look for those features in more affordable dresses. Online searches might reveal which salons/designers have something similar available. That\u2019s something you *can* help her with. At least, if the bridge isn\u2019t completely burned at this point.", "You are not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions. You be a huge asshole to yourself if you said yes to her.\n\nNo is a complete sentence. NTA.", "You are not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions. You be a huge asshole to yourself if you said yes to her.\n\nNo is a complete sentence.

I think, I wouldn't look beautiful in a dress, regardless if it's expensive or not.\n\nBut that might be because I am not a woman...", "Because maybe they have an income disparity? Maybe she has scholarships and he doesn't. Maybe her part time job pays better than his. If they've got an agreed upon percentage then there probably is a reason for that.", "That's a lot of assuming going on. OP didn't state that she's forced to. For all we know he wanted a cheaper apartment that he could easily afford but OP was willing to pay a bit extra to get one that she preferred. \n\nTheir agreement is between them and it's very tiring as a woman in that position having everyone assume that you are getting taken advantage from. I've always had made more that the guys I date, and trust me I've heard these sexist accusations quite often.", "Still, it should be 50/50.", "No, not necessarily. Maybe they wouldn't have as nice an apartment or have an apartment at all if it had to be 50/50. Maybe she volunteered to pay more so that they could be in a better situation. It's common that two people in a relationship aren't making the same income. As long as they have found a solution that works for them and they are both comfortable with it, that is what matters. I've been on both sides of income disparity with my partner. When I was making less, it just simply wasn't possible to pay 50% of what we were spending, but he could easily manage. Now I make more money and pay more than 50% because I'm comfortable with it and don't want to downgrade out standard of living we're at now to enforce the 50/50 rule.", "This is the way! My now husband made almost triple my salary when we first moved in together. We had a 70/30 split in household bills, and used our leftover money to pay personal debt. He always paid for dates unless I had a windfall bonus that month. Once we married, we kept the same deal until I was laid off from my job. I ended up going back to school for my degree (which was cash flowed from savings - - 80% of was from his money).\n\nAmost 10 years later, I'm now making good money that pays all of our bills and he isn't working a traditional job. If you're with the right person, it'll all even out in the end."]}
