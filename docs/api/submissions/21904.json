Gabriel has two kids. Lily and Olive(20female). We three don\u2019t get along due to age differences. I tried but since stopped trying. Now our relationship is very strained due to their pettiness.\n\nMe and Gabriel live alone in our home which is Lily and Olive\u2019s child hood home. Obviously the house has many memories but the fact is they don\u2019t live here anymore but come over every single day without permission or even a heads up. \n\nThey eat up all our food, make messes, argue with each other, mess with my things, hog up the tv, don\u2019t clean up their messes, leave their shit around and then expect me to clean it up, loud as hell, have the audacity to invite their friends over, break crap, bring their annoying cats over, bug my dogs and more. \n\nMe and Gabriel have talked to them many many times about this. It started off with only two or three visits a week but when that didn\u2019t work. Gabriel banned them for not respecting our space whatsoever. They thought he was joking or whatever.\n\nGabriel confiscated the keys he gave them to our house as he had a feeling they wouldn\u2019t listen to what he said. Which he was right.\n\nToday they came over with booze in their hand and their cats in another hand. I wasn\u2019t going to open it but they started banging and I told them to leave as they weren\u2019t welcomed. They got this huge attitude and started saying how I had no right to keep them from entering their home. \n\nI had no energy to argue with them so just shut the door in their face and locked it. They stayed there for about 10 minutes before leaving. They told Gabriel and Gabriel was on my side but their mother and other stepmother are going off on me.

Don't you mean age similarity?", "Technically NTA, but the fact that you consider yourself to be their stepmother is beyond ridiculous (re: \"their mother and other stepmother\" comment). \n\nI don't think we're getting the whole story  from OP; the daughters are definitely reacting to something that happened.  How long ago did they move out, and how long have you lived there?", "NTA\n\nYou may want to look into moving. Their Dad remarried somebody their age and that somebody is now living in their childhood home. Of course they're going to F with you, they're are angry and resentful (with their Dad really, just you by extension if they are honest with themselves). \n\nMove and start fresh somewhere else.", "I won't judge your relationship with their dad, but it sounds like the daughters are being intentionally obnoxious to you to drive you off. Refusing to admit uninvited guests is perfectly valid. NTA.", "NTA.

Stand up. You\u2019re with a man who has daughters 6 years younger than you and this is embarrassing. The three of you are literally peers. Stop talking like they\u2019re children. Stop trying to be an authority figure in their lives and leave. Do better for yourself.", "YTA, wasting your 20\u2019s with some dusty old dude with kids your age, a decade from now when you come to your senses and look at your old husband (you will just be hitting your prime and he will have aged so much) and you recognize that time isn\u2019t refundable.\nI just pity you, this is how you\u2019re spending your 20\u2019s, I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. Sounds like they are determined to make your life hell to drive you away from their dad. I get that they grew up there, but they don't have any rights to that house since they are both legal adults and live elsewhere. And mom and other stepmom need to stay the hell out of it. They are the ones that got themselves banned for acting like entitled ahs. They can let them come over and destroy their homes instead. You can not defend that kind of behavior even if it is your grown kids. \n\n\n  That being said,  if I were them, I'd be pretty grossed out that their dad married someone who was only 6 years old when they were born. But that says way more about your husband than it does you. They may not  like your husband's decision to marry someone so close to their own age, but he's an adult and doesn't have to consult anyone, even his  daughters, on his romantic life.", "YTA and this is hilarious. You are in their childhood home. I still do the same at my childhood home, except my father didn\u2019t bring home my classmate\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI know it sucks but dude this is what you signed up for so either get with it or get out", "YTA.\n\nThat's been their home for 20 years. You waltz in and you're almost the same age as them, start acting like this is your house and they aren't welcome? For real? The audacity. I honestly can't believe your husband is playing along. \n\nYou're dating a man that could be your father and you're pushing his children out of their childhood home and wonder why they don't respect you? Think this one through. \n\nThey SHOULD be allowed to visit without asking. They SHOULD be allowed to eat food there. This should not even be a debate. Yes, they should clean up after themselves, but you're digging your own hole here.", "NTA. They don't live there, they don't even like you. Why do they spend their time there except to harass you?", "ESH - \n\nI see how tried to cover the fact you are a mere 6 years older than the daughter.", "NTA. They don't live there, they have no right to act like it's their home. You guys set rules and they need to obey or stay away.", "YTA. If you love Gabriel then you'll also want for him to maintain a relationship with his daughters. How is are you encouraging that right now? Are you encouraging him to spend quality time with his daughters outside of the house?\n\n\nThat they want to be at their dad's place on a daily basis despite having their own place is wonderful. At that age I selfishly forgot to call my parents on even a merely monthly basis, and that caused my parents to worry and stress. That they're introducing their friends to their dad is also wonderful, and in fact sounds a lot like their dad provided good rules during their childhood. At their age my brother (who was living at home) would never invite his friends over to our home and instead would hang out at their place for hours without notifying my parents during or in advance - which also caused a lot of stress and worry for my parents.\n\n\nAt that age did my brother or I do any of the following unprompted: buy replacement groceries when visiting home from college or clean up messes we made within 24 hrs? No. Our parents had to remind us, and honestly I think it wasn't until after having lived one year alone in an apartment without roommates (and without much furniture or food) that I realized how much daily effort my parents had been making my entire life and that I started taking a critical look at how I was contributing when visiting my parents. And I started small, like asking them what groceries they needed when I was already at the store for my own purchases.\n\n\nI get that you think the daughters are being petty and unreasonable, and I'm not saying you're wrong. However, I think your husbands and your actions are themselves petty and therefor will only create a cycle of pettyness. I presume you don't want that in your life, in which case your choice of actions should be different. Morover, place yourself in the daughter's shoes and imagine what it is like for them to feel like they're being separated from their dad. Imagine what it would feel like if you were a parent being pressured to separate from your own children. And imagine what it will be like for a future child of yours who'll want to be close to their siblings Lily and Olive but who doesn't understand these stressful and negative dynamics that you're promoting.", "NTA\n\nYou uphold a decision made by both Gabriel and you. At the end of the day, it might be their childhood home, but it isn't their home anymore. They are guests when they are in, so they have to follow the rules, not impose them.", "NTA. The mom and OTHER (guessing former) step mother are going off on you? I'm guessing these two were raised poorly, turned out to be little shits, and are being encouraged to disrupt your life. \n\nThey're adults. They need to learn that you are INVITED to another persons house, even if that  person is your parent and that is the house you grew up in.", "Why do they even want to be there? It sounds awful.", "NTA because they've moved out, but you are absolutely 100% AN asshole though.", "NTA. It might have been their childhood home, but they\u2019re not acting like adults. \n\nYou are only enforcing your husband demands.", "YTA. Listen, you may have a wonderful healthy relationship but I am sure these girls are straight up horrified by the entire situation. They grew up in that home and yes, they should clean up after themselves. Sounds like they are pushing some boundaries, possible because their stepmom is practically a peer. But banning them seems severe. You are deepening a rift between your husband and his daughters. This will not serve any of you well.", "*They eat up all our food, make messes, argue with each other, mess with my things, hog up the tv, don\u2019t clean up their messes, leave their shit around and then expect me to clean it up, loud as hell, have the audacity to invite their friends over...*\n\nYep, sounds  like children lol\n\nWhat did you expect when you got with someone with children? It doesn't matter how old they are. I'm also guessing you got with dad a few years ago (or maybe you just got hitched super fast?) so the girls we younger, possibly even minors when they first met. \n\nIf I ever had a step whatever, there is no way they are telling me when I can visit my childhood home. Dad needs to talk to them (if at all) and not you, YTA.", "NTA. They basically banned themselves from the house by acting this way. They don't have to like you and the relationship you have with their dad, but the least they could do is be civilised. I get them, too. It would be weird for my dad to date a girl around my age. But at the end of the day, it's not their home anymore.", "Esh.", "ESH\n\nYou are the same age as his adult children,  it is unlikely they will ever respect you,  so I can understand why you have given up trying,  but they are his kids and they will be around until after you have gone. \n\nWhile it is their family home they aren't adjusting well to the change and not treating the house with respect or you as a new occupant.\n\nMy take on the situation given the snippets is that his ex wife left and is now married to another women, he had a midlife crysis has found a younger woman  (you) to marry and will do anything to keep you including ostracising his own kids. \n\nI suspect they are spending so much time at your house because it is better than being at their mums and her new wife's.\n\nHow close did I get?", "NTA \n\nLikewise, welcome to Reddit. Notice how all the comments with the opposite opinion are just thinly veiled excuses for their bigotry. Based on your story you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "Nta, that is all", "No you are NTA. They are not children and should damn well know how to behave at anyone\u2019s house.", "NTA It isn\u2019t their home. It was once, but is no longer.

That is a hard pill to swallow for any child, but especially when they were teens at first. It's frankly embarrassing, to know your father is attracted to people your own age. \n\nI will never understand how so many men don't care how their dating life impacts their children. Choosing women who hate children, are uninterested in them or just do not understand how to deal with and relate to children. \nI didn't even meet my step kids before my husband and I were 100% sure we were right for each other and I would be a positive addition to the kids' life. \n\nI hope your step kids leave you alone and never speak to you two again.

Did I catch all of that? This is hilarious. YTA", "This is a controversial one but NTA. \n\nIt was their home at one time but not anymore. Just because they grew up there, that doesn\u2019t give them the right to barge in whenever they please and disrespect a space that is now yours because it was theirs a lifetime ago. \n\nAlso everyone judging your relationship based on your age gap is gross and unhelpful.", "YTA. Have you ever thought how invasive it feels to them to have you as queen of THEIR childhood home, covering all of their memories, setting new rules, even going so far as to ban them?", "ESH. \n\nThey shouldn't be acting like they're 10. \n\nFirstly: you married someone with kids. Just because someone is an adult and moved out doesn't mean their childhood home, in which their parent still lives in, isn't seen as their \"home.\" I drop by my parent's all the time, and I'm a few years older than ***you***. Should they be more respectful in the home? Yes. Are they probably doing part of it to get back at their dad for dating someone basically their age? Probably. But you should have known what you were expecting when you got with kids, let alone young adults -- most people are living with their parents well into their 20's. You do know there is the real possibility that something could happen and they could *live* with *their* dad in *their* childhood home, *right*? \n\nSecondly, you're *six* years older than them.

Hell, you're young enough that *your husband* could be *your* father if he had a baby at 16 - relatively uncommon these days, but far from unheard of. You're his new wife that's creepily their age group, you're not, nor will you ever be, a parental figure to them.\n\nEither they're very petty or your husband raised them to be like this. \n\nI hope you don't plan on having kids with him, though -- if you think this is bad, if you and your stepdaughters would likely have kids around the same time...", "YTA for expecting these girls your age to respect you after you married their middle aged father lmao", "Look you're NTA clearly but you have to see how insane this situation is. Why on earth would you marry a 42 year old with kids your age? I'm assuming you didn't meet and marry in a single year, so he's definitely groomed you from a younger age.

While I agree that say, 19 and 34, or 13 and 17, or 17 and 24 is problematic, I just fail to see why 26 and 42 is deemed something to be pitied.", "Lol get him to take Osteo-Biflex (glucosamine-chondroitin supplements) twice a day!! I swear, that stuff is magic.", "It\u2019s actually spot on. Drunk driving accident is high risk but all driving is dangerous. Compared to your example: older partner is more likely to die sooner but we all die. Both are practically inevitable; one is way more likely.", "A 40 year old with a 60 year old isn\u2019t weird, an almost 42 year old dude with a 26 year old woman and a 20 year old child is weird.", "I would argue that half your age plus seven is the first rule, and then the second rule that is your partner needs to be closer to your age than to your oldest child's age.   If parent was born 1970 and kid was born 1994 then the cut off is 1982.  \n\n\nIf you are 20 years older than your kids, your partner can't be less than 10 years younger than you.    \n\n\nOr the much more creeper protection.  Your partner can't attend K-12 school the same time your kids did.", "If it\u2019s a healthy relationship and both parties are happy, that\u2019s all that matters.", "Don't get me wrong, it still gives me the ick when you see a 90 year old with a 40 year old", "I remember like a year ago a woman had a five kids and the youngest and second youngest had an eight year age gap. Instead of focusing on the problem she had, everyone railed against THAT part. Ignoring the reason why she came here. The thread got locked because even the moderators hated it, but yeah, the community sucks when it comes to age gaps of any kind.", "19 and 34 worked for us. Still does 25 years later.", "I don\u2019t disagree that it\u2019s high risk. I\u2019m a personal injury attorney (plaintiff side) and deal primarily with auto incidents.\n\nWhat I disagree with is the false equivalence between drunk driving (a stupid and foreseeable risk) and dropping dead of a brain aneurysm without any warning.", "Different between 40 and 60: 20 years. \n\nDifference between 26 and 42: 16 years. \n\nSo it\u2019s okay as long as they\u2019re older when they meet and he doesn\u2019t have children??  I seriously don\u2019t understand this logic.", "Is \u201chalf your age plus seven\u201d from parks and rec?", "Lol I\u2019m getting absolutely annihilated by these comments \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I seriously don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going here, like if it\u2019s some sort of virtue-signaling or morality police or what.", "Definitely an issue here of seeing the tree but not the forest around it on this topic.", "You\u2019re comparing the wrong two.. it\u2019s the comparison of a sober accident being possible at all time to the possibility of a brain aneurysm. It\u2019s random and possible.", "Even if they have a 40 year old child, being a 40+ year old person and dating someone that much older isn\u2019t nearly the same as dating someone who is that much older while you\u2019re still in your 20s and so is their child. \n\nPretty easy logic to see when you\u2019re not just making it about the age difference, there\u2019s several factors here and if you fail to see that you\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing or being purposely obtuse.", "Actually yes. Let's assume OP met her husband 2 years ago, she was 24 and he was 40. She had been an adult for 6 years, although 18-20 as far as being an adult is concerned is quite the baby steps, while he had been one for 22 years, had raised a family, had 2 divorces, etc. The problem is not the actual age difference, it is the number of adult years. Honestly below 25 is icky when you are 32+ because of life experience.", "Didn\u2019t you know you *had* to meet your SO in high school or college? Professors don\u2019t count.", "The comment to which I responded specifically said drunk driving. I\u2019m not comparing anything - I am simply pointing out why the comment to which I responded had a very, very weak argument based on a flawed premise."]}
