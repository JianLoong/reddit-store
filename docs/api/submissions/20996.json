That teaches them that your love for them is less important than your resentment towards their other parent, whom they also still love.

Some kind of restraining order maybe? Or a defamation suit? I dunno. Something that forces her to stop lying about OP and stop foisting a stranger's child on OP.\n\nA change to the custody order also seems appropriate, such as requestjng that all communication go through a parenting app where it will be made a record that the court can review. The only things she legit needs to discuss with OP is the child they do share together. Her opinions on whether OP should parent a child who is not his are not germane.\n\nI also am wondering whether it's time to call CPS. It seems lik psychological abuse to be lying to a child that the Not Father is her father and to be setting her up for a lifetime of believing \"her father\" cruelly rejected her over and over in life while seemingly showing extreme favoritism to his \"other\" child. The mother's  lies also cuts this child off from pursuing a relationship with whatever actual relatives may be out there. Cruel. Someday this child is going to find out her mother deceived her into a lot of suffering, and that OP was just a victim in all this too.\n\nWhat a monster.", "Given that their idea of compassion is for him to pretend that his ex\u2019s affair baby is his, I can see how that would hurt him.", "Yeah this is really the worst because the kid deserves love and compassion, but it *would* hurt for op to give it to her", "Oh wow. That is just so wrong. You're still NTA, but I feel terrible for this little girl. She thought her dad was willing to take brother and not her.

Will the family expect you to take the child in?", "I'm pretty sure he meant that OP should say that to the family members calling him.", "That's why i said,  understand WHY not to. It's just hard to not want to say it anyway. \n\nThat child is being punished for the sins of her mother, and that's not fair. And OP certainly isn't responsible for her. But it's hard not to feel sorry for the girl and want to agree that it would be so easy. \n\nOP is NTA, and shouldn't accept the role. But just feel bad for the girl", "You are falling for Hannah's POV. The child's problem isn't that OP hasn't signed on as a surrogate father. The child's problem is that she has a parent who tells hugely consequential lies to her, plus tries to draw everyone in her life into supporting this fabricated reality. \n\nOne day this child is going to find out that her entire life story is an elaborate lie and that everyone who \"loves\" her was in on it the whole time. That they knew all along that OP was categorically not her father. There is nothing good for her in having yet another person supporting the lies. If anything, the greatest kindness done was in refusing to be one more person betraying her trust, and by refusing to undermine his own kid's reality by lying \"haha jk jk jk all those years I told you that your sister isn't my daughter was a fib, she actually is, surprise!\"\n\nHe is no more responsible for her situation than you or I are. It's unfair to pressure him to cave into the ex's manipulations, and take on a role in this child's life. Her life is tragic, but his responsibility stops at notifying CPS about the mother's psychological abuse so they can investigate, as well as doing everything possible to protect his own child from the influence of the mother's dishonesty.l and manipulative nature. There's no way it hasn't harmed both children.", "No I'm not. I'm siding with OP. You're choosing to ignore what I'm actually saying. \n\nI simply said that it's easy to WANT to say \"what's the harm\". I acknowledged the harm, and said don't do it. \n\nThe child has several issues, that arrose out of this. That child is going to grow up with issues. Part of it is going to be this weird dynamic of her brother having a father and her not, and being rejected by her brother's father.\n\nI can empathize with the child. I've been in that weird outsider with my half siblings place. It's hard enough when your step parents/other parents DO embrace you. It's a whole other world when you're rejected. We also have no information on how her brother treats her, based on what he sees from his parents. It's a huge dynamic and a huge issue. \n\nOP has no obligation to that child (unless He wanted to simply because she's his son's sister. Which some people would some people wouldn't and that's OK. Everyone is different). OP shouldn't take that obligation. But it easy to want to tell someone to help that little girl who is sick in a bad place by no fault of her own. It's her mother's fault entirely, and that little girl is going to reap the consequences. And as hard as it is, it doesn't make OP the asshole and OP shouldn't take responsibility for her.", "You are mistaken. I didn't accuse you of siding with Hannah. I said you're _falling for her point of view_. In other words, the tug at your heartstrings is due to her manipulativeness. She created all those heartbreaking circumstances, to manipulate people into believing that the pain she has inflicted on the child should compel others to do things that go against their very conscience.", "\u2018If I were a better man\u2019\n\nOh she can stuff it where the sun don\u2019t shine.

Not the man her mother lied into saying is her dad. She has no one. \n\nI don't give a rats ass about the girls mom. That's why i told OP, not to step into that role because it gets people roped in to shit and he's not obligated.", "Custody rights is in the child's best interest. There is nothing automatic with step-parents, so he would be in court proceedings if he wanted to have custody of her in such a scenario. If he is granted custody, he could go for adoption for example. \n\nIt's very individual and it could also be grandparents or a sibling to the deceased that gets custody.\n\nIn the end it can be a battle between multiple people that want her in their family.\n\nNo one has automatic custody of her but there could be positive criteria like custody being mentioned in a will or the fact she lived with him a long time. Depending on her age, she will get a say as well.", "Ahhh yeah that would be good too", "Exactly. The whole idea is to keep the child\u2019s experience and information needs the first priority, the optics of how you guys think you\u2019re going to look to the kids or how they\u2019re going to judge you should not be a decision making criterion.", "How\u2019s she being punished?", "He's not a step parent. He's mothers ex-husband and the father of her older half-brother. He has no direct relation to Hannah's child and has not been involved with her mother during her life. Realistically he wouldn't/shouldn't be involved in anything to do with her custody if the mother passed beyond simply saying no thank you if asked.", "She doesn't get a father. Her mother is lying to her, and she's facing the consequence. No matter how gentle he is about it, he just rejected her. \n\nNone of that is her fault. It's not her fault she exists, it's not her fault her mother was an adulterer. It's not her fault that her bio dad is out of the picture. \n\nYet in the end she's met with the punishment of rejection.", "We all meet rejection at some point. It hurts but she will be ok, I come from a similar situation (my mother didn\u2019t cheat though)"]}
