That teaches them that your love for them is less important than your resentment towards their other parent, whom they also still love.

Some kind of restraining order maybe? Or a defamation suit? I dunno. Something that forces her to stop lying about OP and stop foisting a stranger's child on OP.\n\nA change to the custody order also seems appropriate, such as requestjng that all communication go through a parenting app where it will be made a record that the court can review. The only things she legit needs to discuss with OP is the child they do share together. Her opinions on whether OP should parent a child who is not his are not germane.\n\nI also am wondering whether it's time to call CPS. It seems lik psychological abuse to be lying to a child that the Not Father is her father and to be setting her up for a lifetime of believing \"her father\" cruelly rejected her over and over in life while seemingly showing extreme favoritism to his \"other\" child. The mother's  lies also cuts this child off from pursuing a relationship with whatever actual relatives may be out there. Cruel. Someday this child is going to find out her mother deceived her into a lot of suffering, and that OP was just a victim in all this too.\n\nWhat a monster.", "Given that their idea of compassion is for him to pretend that his ex\u2019s affair baby is his, I can see how that would hurt him.", "Yeah this is really the worst because the kid deserves love and compassion, but it *would* hurt for op to give it to her", "Oh wow. That is just so wrong. You're still NTA, but I feel terrible for this little girl. She thought her dad was willing to take brother and not her.

Will the family expect you to take the child in?", "I'm pretty sure he meant that OP should say that to the family members calling him.", "That's why i said,  understand WHY not to. It's just hard to not want to say it anyway. \n\nThat child is being punished for the sins of her mother, and that's not fair. And OP certainly isn't responsible for her. But it's hard not to feel sorry for the girl and want to agree that it would be so easy. \n\nOP is NTA, and shouldn't accept the role. But just feel bad for the girl", "You are falling for Hannah's POV. The child's problem isn't that OP hasn't signed on as a surrogate father. The child's problem is that she has a parent who tells hugely consequential lies to her, plus tries to draw everyone in her life into supporting this fabricated reality. \n\nOne day this child is going to find out that her entire life story is an elaborate lie and that everyone who \"loves\" her was in on it the whole time. That they knew all along that OP was categorically not her father. There is nothing good for her in having yet another person supporting the lies. If anything, the greatest kindness done was in refusing to be one more person betraying her trust, and by refusing to undermine his own kid's reality by lying \"haha jk jk jk all those years I told you that your sister isn't my daughter was a fib, she actually is, surprise!\"\n\nHe is no more responsible for her situation than you or I are. It's unfair to pressure him to cave into the ex's manipulations, and take on a role in this child's life. Her life is tragic, but his responsibility stops at notifying CPS about the mother's psychological abuse so they can investigate, as well as doing everything possible to protect his own child from the influence of the mother's dishonesty.l and manipulative nature. There's no way it hasn't harmed both children.", "No I'm not. I'm siding with OP. You're choosing to ignore what I'm actually saying. \n\nI simply said that it's easy to WANT to say \"what's the harm\". I acknowledged the harm, and said don't do it. \n\nThe child has several issues, that arrose out of this. That child is going to grow up with issues. Part of it is going to be this weird dynamic of her brother having a father and her not, and being rejected by her brother's father.\n\nI can empathize with the child. I've been in that weird outsider with my half siblings place. It's hard enough when your step parents/other parents DO embrace you. It's a whole other world when you're rejected. We also have no information on how her brother treats her, based on what he sees from his parents. It's a huge dynamic and a huge issue. \n\nOP has no obligation to that child (unless He wanted to simply because she's his son's sister. Which some people would some people wouldn't and that's OK. Everyone is different). OP shouldn't take that obligation. But it easy to want to tell someone to help that little girl who is sick in a bad place by no fault of her own. It's her mother's fault entirely, and that little girl is going to reap the consequences. And as hard as it is, it doesn't make OP the asshole and OP shouldn't take responsibility for her.", "You are mistaken. I didn't accuse you of siding with Hannah. I said you're _falling for her point of view_. In other words, the tug at your heartstrings is due to her manipulativeness. She created all those heartbreaking circumstances, to manipulate people into believing that the pain she has inflicted on the child should compel others to do things that go against their very conscience.", "\u2018If I were a better man\u2019\n\nOh she can stuff it where the sun don\u2019t shine.

You can make a huge difference in her life. Be the man she needs, please.", "Brutal. ESH. You\u2019re a grown man. Seems like telling a seven year old you\u2019re not her dad was revenge for not being her dad. Coulda handled it a million other ways. Like an adult. \n\nYou\u2019re a father. You really thought it was appropriate to make a statement like that to her. Instead of the STUPID BITCH you married and IS THE MOTHER OF YOUR SON. You told a 7 year old, that will ALWAYS be apart of your life as she is your sons SISTER. That you basically don\u2019t want anything to do with her because you\u2019re not her father. \n\nI hope you never become a step parent. Oops.\n\nBtw. My dad was an abusive alcoholic asshole that tried to kill me and my mom. My mom still tried to raise HIS DAUGHTER, MY SISTER before her own parents even tried to be there for her. You don\u2019t have to raise her but GODDAMN be an adult. I can\u2019t believe you refer to your SON\u2019S SISTER as \u201cthe child\u201d. You don\u2019t even try to give her a fake name. It sucks no one else sees how boo boo poor me you\u2019re acting when you just crushed a 7 year old girl. BTW YOUR SONS SISTER THAT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY STUCK WITH:)", "So let me get this right she cheated got pregnant by someone else and then told that child you are the father and when you say no you are the a hole wow that family is delusional", "NTA this was an incredibly cruel thing she did to this child.  It's one thing to not have a parent in your life. It is another entirely to watch that parent reject you while they love your sibling. Especially with the gender dynamics at play here. She probably thinks you don't love her because she is a girl.", "Not to mention, I think accepting a role as a fatherly figure may open up OP to being sued for child support because of possible emotional relationship.", "Isn\u2019t it always funny how, in situations like these, the person who caused the situation is the person claiming to be the victim? Like everyone is a victim in this story, OP because he was cheated on and had his life upended. The son because he went from being a two parent household to having to parents split custody. And the daughter, who is the direct result of said infidelity who was also lied to by her mom about who her dad was (which was definitely affecting her self esteem). \n\nAnd yet here the ex is claiming victim hood. Like no, girl. You caused this mess and are continuing to worsen it by lying to your daughter!", "NTA at all, but please be kind to this little girl. Your son at least has you as a parent. His sister only has her horror of a mother.", "Hannah is the ex...\n\nBut I completely agree, that poor child.", "I mean, she had to find out eventually. Really this should\u2019ve never been a situation. \n\nHe\u2019s not the one that lied about it. He\u2019s just the messenger that has to be honest. This could\u2019ve all been avoided, if mommy didn\u2019t lie to her daughter. \n\nMom SHOULD have told her. And OP has been pushing her to. But sometimes you gotta step in and fix this. And that\u2019s what this was, a fix. Undoing a lie that shouldn\u2019t have been told.", ">there had to be a better way. you and mom should have acted like adults and figured that shit out.\n\n\n\nThere is no \"you and mom\".\nThat right there is a child who was being lied to daily. A child thinking her father hates her.\nThat needed to be corrected. \n\nFor Op, that child is a daily reminder of what he went through. \n\nIn no universe is Op an A H. \n\nStop talking what YOU will not do and if you will, fantastic. Just don't expect Op to", "He doesn't want to be her father figure and thats all that matters", "Not wanting anything to do with the ex doesn't translate to punishing her child. \n\nMany families have this dynamic. The difference is they don't feel entitled to foist off their children on other people and lie to their kids. \n\nWhen she quits lying and feeling entitled, Op can have the type of relationship he wants or he can choose not to.", "Is that all that matters?", "\u201cBe careful of your ex because I bet she is poisoning your boy too\u201d\n\n\u2026and not just in the obvious \u201cyour father sucks\u201d way. \n\nHe may be internalizing feelings of guilt and confusion that dad likes him but not his sister, as I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been told the girl is also yours. Check in with him not just on what he\u2019s been told about you, but how he\u2019s feeling. Make sure he understands nothing of this is his fault or his burden.", "Because she\u2019d rather the child be upset and blame it on her \u201cdad\u201d for being horrible, then tell the truth and have to carry feeling bad herself.", ">We've seen several reddits over the last few months proposing this exact thing.", "Both of these scenarios describe my parents \ud83d\ude05 My mom tried to shield me from what a lying, cheating asshole my dad was. My dad was trying to use me to hurt my mom by constantly telling me how she broke his heart and our family - while he was living with his new girlfriend... Obviously I was hurt by my dad's lies but if my mom had been honest at least I would have never thought he was the martyr he made himself out to be.", "It is fair. Because it\u2019s not his kid. It\u2019s not his responsibility. \n\nI think it\u2019s absolutely fucked that after this dudes life has been ruined, you expect him to pick up the pieces and fix things he didn\u2019t create. \n\nMan just wants to live his life. He just wants some normalcy. Just because he\u2019s an adult doesn\u2019t mean he has to sacrifice his happiness. He deserves to be happy, too, just as much as anyone else.", "Nah, she\u2019s just wants him to pay for the daughter. That\u2019s why she put his name on the b/c, because if you don\u2019t fight it you\u2019re legally liable. This is just a variation on that theme, have some compassion for the kid, he then starts paying for stuff - emotional manipulation 101.  Hannah clearly despises him, she doesn\u2019t want to get back together.", "reddit has lost its mind on this one. so busy hating the shitty mom they can't even feel for a 7 year old girl getting hurt by all this.", "It's incredibly weird."]}
