Because we were married at the time, I was the assumed father and had to prove I was not and then I had to relinquish the automatic rights I got from the child being born while we were married.

Hannah glared at me from across the room when her daughter returned to her and her family have since contacted me and asked how I could be so cruel and why would I say that to their granddaughter.

The truth should be told and this child should not grow up believing you are her father. The only problem is her mother should have explained it to her long ago!", "NTA, your ex and her family are abusive to this child.  Telling her an outright lie about who her father is.  She needs to own up to what she did and the results of what she did, as does her family.  When did they plan on telling her.  What were they telling her about you taking her brother places, buying him gifts and not her?  Next time they say something to you tell them all you did was tell the truth while they lied.", "NTA\n\nyour ex-wife is insanely entitled and has likely caused trauma to her daughter from her lies.", "NTA\n\nYour ex and all of her family are horribly delusional AHs.", "Hannah's family sounds dumb and kind of evil.

Your ex is setting her daughter up for therapy and has probably hoping you would form a bond with the girl and she'd be able to get financial assistance from you.  Even though all parental rights were severed, she might have tried making a case you're acting in a parental manner and filed for child support.  \n\nYou were right to shut this down. \n\nYou could point out to your ex in laws how cruel your ex was to you and how cruel she is to her daughter letting her believe a lie. But that would open a whole other can of worms. \n\nTaking the emotional issues out, the girl also needs to be aware of her sperm donor's medical history.", "NTA. Your ex put you and her daughter in a horrible situation. The paternity of her daughter was already made clear and it sounds like your ex has been lying to her about it this entire time. Her mother hurt her and that is 100% on her, not you. If she wanted you to be the father of another child, she shouldn\u2019t have cheated.

Could she have spun a story to them that paints you in a bad light?\n\nThat poor kid. To think this entire time that dads just treat sons differently to daughters. That\u2019s heartbreaking. You did the right thing.", "NTA, but it would be a kindness if you see the girl again to tell her that she deserves a good dad and that you\u2019re sorry, but that it\u2019s not you. At 7 she\u2019s still figuring out how things work, and the lies she\u2019s being told aren\u2019t helping.", "I would guess she was already asking why her brother is with me every other week and I never take her or do anything for her.

That teaches them that your love for them is less important than your resentment towards their other parent, whom they also still love. (I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean to suggest seriously that OP do so, just wanted to make absolutely clear in case misinterpreted by OP or passersby).", "Yes and this seems like something to go back to court for. Some kind of restraining order maybe? Or a defamation suit? I dunno. Something that forces her to stop lying about OP and stop foisting a stranger's child on OP.\n\nA change to the custody order also seems appropriate, such as requestjng that all communication go through a parenting app where it will be made a record that the court can review. The only things she legit needs to discuss with OP is the child they do share together. Her opinions on whether OP should parent a child who is not his are not germane.\n\nI also am wondering whether it's time to call CPS. It seems lik psychological abuse to be lying to a child that the Not Father is her father and to be setting her up for a lifetime of believing \"her father\" cruelly rejected her over and over in life while seemingly showing extreme favoritism to his \"other\" child. The mother's  lies also cuts this child off from pursuing a relationship with whatever actual relatives may be out there. Cruel. Someday this child is going to find out her mother deceived her into a lot of suffering, and that OP was just a victim in all this too.\n\nWhat a monster.", "Given that their idea of compassion is for him to pretend that his ex\u2019s affair baby is his, I can see how that would hurt him.", "Yeah this is really the worst because the kid deserves love and compassion, but it *would* hurt for op to give it to her", "Oh wow. That is just so wrong. You're still NTA, but I feel terrible for this little girl. She thought her dad was willing to take brother and not her. She might even have thought that when she's old enough she could go with you too. Oof, poor kid. \n\nHonestly you were kinder to her by telling her the truth now instead of waiting until later. Because her mother was never going to tell her.", "What will happen if something happens to Hannah? Will the family expect you to take the child in?", "I'm pretty sure he meant that OP should say that to the family members calling him.", "That's why i said,  understand WHY not to. It's just hard to not want to say it anyway. \n\nThat child is being punished for the sins of her mother, and that's not fair. And OP certainly isn't responsible for her. But it's hard not to feel sorry for the girl and want to agree that it would be so easy. \n\nOP is NTA, and shouldn't accept the role. But just feel bad for the girl", "You are falling for Hannah's POV. The child's problem isn't that OP hasn't signed on as a surrogate father. The child's problem is that she has a parent who tells hugely consequential lies to her, plus tries to draw everyone in her life into supporting this fabricated reality. \n\nOne day this child is going to find out that her entire life story is an elaborate lie and that everyone who \"loves\" her was in on it the whole time. That they knew all along that OP was categorically not her father. There is nothing good for her in having yet another person supporting the lies. If anything, the greatest kindness done was in refusing to be one more person betraying her trust, and by refusing to undermine his own kid's reality by lying \"haha jk jk jk all those years I told you that your sister isn't my daughter was a fib, she actually is, surprise!\"\n\nHe is no more responsible for her situation than you or I are. It's unfair to pressure him to cave into the ex's manipulations, and take on a role in this child's life. Her life is tragic, but his responsibility stops at notifying CPS about the mother's psychological abuse so they can investigate, as well as doing everything possible to protect his own child from the influence of the mother's dishonesty.l and manipulative nature. There's no way it hasn't harmed both children.", "No I'm not. I'm siding with OP. You're choosing to ignore what I'm actually saying. \n\nI simply said that it's easy to WANT to say \"what's the harm\". I acknowledged the harm, and said don't do it. \n\nThe child has several issues, that arrose out of this. That child is going to grow up with issues. Part of it is going to be this weird dynamic of her brother having a father and her not, and being rejected by her brother's father.\n\nI can empathize with the child. I've been in that weird outsider with my half siblings place. It's hard enough when your step parents/other parents DO embrace you. It's a whole other world when you're rejected. We also have no information on how her brother treats her, based on what he sees from his parents. It's a huge dynamic and a huge issue. \n\nOP has no obligation to that child (unless He wanted to simply because she's his son's sister. Which some people would some people wouldn't and that's OK. Everyone is different). OP shouldn't take that obligation. But it easy to want to tell someone to help that little girl who is sick in a bad place by no fault of her own. It's her mother's fault entirely, and that little girl is going to reap the consequences. And as hard as it is, it doesn't make OP the asshole and OP shouldn't take responsibility for her.", "You are mistaken. I didn't accuse you of siding with Hannah. I said you're _falling for her point of view_. In other words, the tug at your heartstrings is due to her manipulativeness. She created all those heartbreaking circumstances, to manipulate people into believing that the pain she has inflicted on the child should compel others to do things that go against their very conscience."]}
