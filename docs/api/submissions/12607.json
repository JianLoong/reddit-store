I can also see why your bf\u2019s sister thought it was inappropriate, especially there were children there. I think the setting matters just as much as the action itself. Kinda like how wearing a bikini at the pool or beach with family isn\u2019t comparable to wearing just a bra/panties in somebody else\u2019s house. Yeah the same amount of skin is shown but it\u2019s almost about the expectation?

Still NTA. \n\nI've suspected jealousy because it;s an easy answer. You're in great physical shape. That basic pose? I bet she can't do that. I surely can't ;-) If you see someone who is much better then you it's normal to feel a little jealous. It's not always bad, it could turn into positive feeling like admiration, but sometimes it's more like envy, especially if you're in similar age: \"Oh damn, I wish I could be like her but I'm not, so she shouldn't show she's better than me.\"", "I mean there\u2019s no other reason for her to be that way.

It\u2019s not like you had yoga pants on and were covered. You\u2019re already mostly naked in a bikini.", "NTA but you could have just said yes without the demo. I bet cashy money all the people asking you about it were men. You didn't do anything wrong. I just suspect the motives of the people asking you about it, and the conversations they'll have about you and your \"flexibility\" when you're not around. The sister is gross for conflating athleticism with sex, but that's where some people go. Like it or not, you deliberately drew attention to your body in mixed company. Your motives may have been innocent. Not everyone will see it that way. I personally couldn't care less, but I can see a variety of views about a woman flashing her crotch, even if covered, and putting her leg behind her head in public. Would you do it at work? No. Would you do it at a family dinner? Probably not. People will have wildly divergent views on whether or not it's appropriate. Most people don't understand the training and the sport. They are't used to seeing people in poses like that. They are going to go straight to the gutter. Again, you're not at fault. People have dirty minds.", "NTA.

Sounds like everyone else saw it for the wholesomeness that it was.", "[deleted]", "NTA I think it\u2019s strange that she would give you the cold shoulder. Unless, as someone suggested, she found it hot, and does not welcome those feelings. Or unless she found it so unseemly, she is weirdly embarrassed. \n\nI tend to think of my reactions as normal, but I realize that humans have a wide variation of reactions and things they find appropriate according to their family culture. However, for me, it would be really embarrassing to feel jealousy and insecurity, and then to actively call attention to it. Also, I\u2019m kind of used to that behavior with younger people who have these special skills and can do them\u2026 My daughter and her ballerina friend would do all sorts of interesting poses in photos, or during walks. Some of them actually make me a little nervous, like when they\u2019re doing something on a rock wall, but I just ignore it and figure they know their limits.", "YTA put your hoo ha away.", "The male mind is gonna do what it does. It can be shut down or stopped but it boots up as it\u2019s hardwired to. That being said, I think 2 things that make this a draw. \n1- think karate. What\u2019s done and practiced in the dojo may not look or seem appropriate when done  in a back yard and viewed by people who aren\u2019t familiar with it. \n2- this girls man guaranteed started down that thought process as a reflex. That\u2019s fine because as I said that\u2019s what men are hard wired to do whether they admit it or not. The problem here is that the girlfriend didn\u2019t seem to trust that he would be a good boy and shut it off. Maybe she doesn\u2019t understand a man\u2019s mind?", "NTA. I don't think this is suggestive at all. It's literally a basic move like you pointed out, and it wasn't like you did this unprompted. I think there are some people who would find that move hot, but that's really on them, not you. It's only sexual if other people make it sexual.", "Idk.  I have mixed opinions about this.  I know you were asked if you know any moves, but it didn\u2019t mean you were forced to do the move.  You could have just said yes and moved on.  You shouldn\u2019t be sexualized, but on the other hand, lifting your leg behind your head  in a bikini exposed your vag to everyone without their consent.

You did nothing wrong. I bet it looked cool.", "Info: It was a small bikini? Perphaps your sister basically flashing to everyone there including childs and maybe thats the \"real cause\"? Still giving you a could shoulder without really saying anything beyond \"seems innapropiate\" is AH move.", "NTA. I was pretty immature in high-school and one of my friends was a ballerina. People would often ask her to do poses as well, and I would be SO annoyed every time. I was just jealous of her skills and the attention she got.

She\u2019s jealous. Hopefully not of your relationship, but I\u2019ve seen sisters/moms behave like that with their sons\u2019 SOs. She\u2019s jealous she can\u2019t do it and that people were giving you attention for doing it. Not a deal breaker, as you aren\u2019t dating her directly, but something to keep an eye on imo. Women who need that much attention are exhausting.", "NTA. They asked you delivered and obviously made some people feel insecure because they can\u2019t do that and others were amazed.

Women who complain like that are usually very insecure.", "NTA - I hate that she tried to sexualize the move by saying it was \u201csuggestive\u201d, it\u2019s rude and assumes a weird motivation on your part for no reason. \n\nThat said, positioning matters - if you\u2019re standing and doing this move in a way that puts your genitals at face level in close proximity of someone sitting, I can see that someone being uncomfortable.

Anyone sexualizing a normal thing you did related to topic conversation at the moment is weird.", "As long as there was no wardrobe malfunction I don\u2019t see the big deal\n\nNTA", "NTA,\n\nI wonder how your man would have felt if no one said anything negative. You are a trained gymnast. People sexualize women. And sure, people can think what they want, but I don\u2019t think you did anything obversely wrong here. \nMaybe the family is more conservative than it appears. And the swimsuit situation makes this another layer. I think the issue here is the family viewing it sexually. I think it would have been different if you had no formal training. So, you\u2019re NTA here. \nMoving forward, you might want to consider why someone is asking or the context to protect yourself. I\u2019d say something like, I don\u2019t have to prove myself and move on from it if you aren\u2019t sure or don\u2019t want to. And, Your boyfriend giving you the cold shoulder does not seem right, but not surprising. \nYour boyfriend seems to be processing what happened and how his family viewed you. If he\u2019s going be acting weird and cold, whatever on his part. In a perfect world, he needs to get over himself and tell his sister that there wasn\u2019t anything to it. Be proud of your gymnast skills. And that being said, I wouldn\u2019t feed into the negativity. If he tries to shame you, it might be something to think about. Be inquisitive about his thoughts when he does speak on it. But also, no need to shame yourself either and stand that you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \nMy point of view is that not everyone sees women and gymnastics or our form with innocent eyes. We are sexualized and people have different reactions to us in different settings. Does it make it right? No. But realistically, you have to be aware that not everyone is going to be understanding. But I also think that you aren\u2019t some loose person stretching out at a family gathering. There is a time and place for showing off. The sister may have thought you were drawing too much male gaze to you and found it inappropriate. However, it does not mean that you were doing that on purpose. And that is what your boyfriend has to accept. If he cannot handle that and stand by you about it after working through his feelings, you both might have larger issues.

If I could do it and someone asked me to do it, I would have done exactly the same thing. But I'm insecure and I'm second hand butt hurt picturing a woman that's hotter than me doing things I can't do in front of my dude. It absolutely doesn't mean you're the booty hole captain. Other's insecurities aren't your problem and don't feel bad. You're a bad ass. You're as old as your spine so maintaining flexibility is not only sexy but healthy for your body and sex life.", "It can be hot without being suggestive or inappropriate. If someone is turned on by it, that\u2019s on them.", "If you weren't wearing a bikini, then I don't think there would have been an issue with that particular pose. I mean, you lifted your leg behind your head, in a bikini. I would think you're trashy for choosing that particular pose to do in a bikini. Everyone got a show though, so they clapped, lol.", "I think it\u2019s more to do with the fact you were wearing a bikini or bathing suit. It should not be that way (and I certainly don\u2019t feel this way) but it is not usual in society to see the bottom part of the crotch of someone\u2019s pants / bikini bottoms or whatever, so maybe that\u2019s why the sister felt uncomfortable.\n\nStill it\u2019s nothing to worry about and you clearly had good intentions so who cares! She\u2019ll get over it!", "Don\u2019t listen to these people. Prudes need to get over themselves. They see sex in everything when there\u2019s not.", "Right and if a leotard is riding up I\u2019m sure so are the bikini bottoms that are already high waisted plus she said it was somewhere in between so if it was string bikini that\u2019s even worse it\u2019s truly not the same. Plus during competitions everyone attending is knowing anything could happen this was at a pool (unknown if it was public) around people who not everyone asked to see it.", "Because it's not sexual like at all lol", "Well that's what happened. You kinda just got tricked in the most simple way possible to do a sexual pose for someone.", "Ah, then that is very good! Your boyfriend is a reasonable person then. Ok, you have a great day and remember, it's his sister that was out of line. Not you.", "Men and children view a woman doing the splits in a bikini differently", "> any show of skill should be hot\n\nWell said! I am in awe of talented people, whether they are athletes or astronauts!", "Being good at things is attractive", "Agreed! There's always going to be someone who sexualizes anything, sometimes merely because of your gender. Rule 34 exists for a reason, but if anyone is to be assigned \"blame\" for OP being sexualized in an inappropriate setting without consent, it's the one doing the sexualizing. The misogyny is coming from inside the house here, sounds like homegirl is a PMAB who's butthurt she wasn't getting picked for the attention.", "I agree. Biology compels most men to be attracted to women. It isn't good or bad; it just *is.*\n\nHowever, Gentlemen learn to control their animal instincts.", "Exactly. If it were a man who put down their drink and did those same moves, I doubt the reaction would be the same. Certainly they wouldn\u2019t be calling it suggestive to the same degree, because men aren\u2019t sexualized in hetero society the way that women are. Definitely NTA, and tell her to stop setting feminism back 40 years.", "So true! Flexibility makes literally everything better!", "Good way to put it!", "A bikini is a lot different from a leotard!", "Except leotards are (presumably) made not to ride up.", "a bikini and a leotard are 2 different things, gymnasts also use special glues and such to hold leotards in place, and typically don\u2019t do these types of moves directly in front of people inches away\u2026", "the term \u201csuggestive\u201d implies innuendo, or a subtle signal that one is looking for sex. a standing split to show off gymnastic moves is not suggestive in the context OP gave. some ppl may have found it sexually arousing, but that their issue, not OP\u2019s.", "I wouldn\u2019t personally think it\u2019s \u201ctrashy\u201d but it would be more of a view than I\u2019d be comfortable with at a family thing.

Because they cover the same crotch area. \n\nSo NTA op.", "Do these people leave their houses??", "I love how you tried to catch someone up in a double standard, failed, then doubled down anyway.", "That is a ridiculous thing to say. I count many athletes (men and women) as friends who come to my pool. I have kids. Them doing moves is motivating to us. My god, \"real-world social norms\"?!? Maybe at YOUR pool in YOUR little corner. Jfc. Stop sexualizing every goddamn thing you see.", "What people?? The people *asking* him to do gymnast moves???\n\nHere's a real world social norm - don't ask people to do things that you are uncomfortable with them doing.  And if the sister was not one of the people asking, maybe she should take her complaints to all the family members asking OP to do gymnast moves while she is in her swimsuit.  As opposed to appropriate gymnast clothing... which looks just like swimwear....", "You hang out around weirdos.", "Don't sexualize this stuff. This is the same things kids do at gymnastics. It is not a sexual move, don't make it into one.", "love that you follow your kid to learn the cool moves!", "I mean, yeah.", ">flexibility is hot\n\nI mean, you say that, but I saw a woman at Cirque du Soleil who could bend herself in half and hold herself up entirely with her mouth. Amazing talent, but personally thought it was horrifying to look at :P", "And I mean, is a bikini really that far off from the types of outfits worn in the Olympics? It's not a sport known for being possible to do while wearing lots of extra fabric. Your tummy being exposed isn't any more exposed while doing a standing split. If you had a wardrobe malfunction and accidently flashed your vag to your entire bfs family I could see there being reason to complain, lol, but would they be upset if you'd done a fun split jumping off a diving board in a bikini? If you were doing a frogstroke in the water? If you'd done a cartwheel? \n\nIt really bothers me on a larger scale that we live in a society that encourages women to be hot above all else, and demonizes women who are not considered to be as hot, and encourages dressing in sexy clothes, but then judges and slut shames women for, idk, doing normal human being activities.\n\nI'm sorry they made you feel weird about something cute and fun, sounds like someone else there has the issue and not you, NTA.", "That's what hairspray (or tacky spray) is for!

He had 3 daughters and they would\u2019ve never exposed their legs to him. I was allowed to wear shorts but never bare midriffs or bikinis. My shorts couldn\u2019t be form fitting, and if my top exposed any cleavage it was an automatic no. Even still we were considered the scandalous members of the family. Modesty is definitely cultural and varied", "So what do you need to be explained here?", "When ur hitting it from behind so you don't have to make eye contact and she turns her head all the way around like an owl", "Only if you do it in a bikini.", "Thank you!", "Ha! Oh god.", "I cackled. Thank you for that", "I need a young priest and an old priest", "Gonna tattoo this on my upper back like a threat", "I think I'd need a few hours of waxing before I was ready for a bikini.", "It didn\u2019t necessarily bother me I just think that most likely what\u2019s happening is because the pose is inappropriate with the clothing style she had on and children may not sexualize things thank god but if something had slipped out the children still shouldn\u2019t be seeing that.", "Happy cake day"]}
