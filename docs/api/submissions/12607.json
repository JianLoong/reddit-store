Her voicing her concern could be genuine... It's just better to be aware. But NTA as you didnt have any bad intentions.", "Idk what to say on this one. Personally, I'd be uncomfortable with someone doing that in front of me in a bikini. It's not the end of the world, but you chose a pose that puts your junk near eye level and not everyone is gonna be cool with that. She shouldn't be a dick about it, but I can understand why she could be upset. Also, were there children present? She might have thought it was inappropriate for kids. I'm not going to make a call either way because I feel like this is one of those things you have to see to know who might be in the wrong.", "Ew why is this woman sexualizing your body and an arbitrary sport?

I mean has his sister watched the Olympics.  In most of the summer games, including gymnastics women are basically in bikinis", "NTA They asked, you showed.. she got jealous and tried to make it seem like you was just opening your legs to everyone at the party. She sounds American as hell", "NTA. Anyone who sexualizes what you did, the problem lies with them.", "NTA \n\nThat's so cool!!!", "NTA, bf's sister didn't appreciate the attention you got. Unless she's narcissistic, it should blow over soon.", "NTA.  She sounds insecure and jealous. That sometimes will lead people to shame the ones they are jealous of. Ignore her.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong whatsoever. If anyone is looking at it through a lens of some sort of sexuality, then **they** are the problem, not you.", "NTA\n\nShe's jealous.", "Nta. She\u2019s the naive one for thinking that basic gymnastic moves are suggestive.", "NTA. Someone sounds jelly.", "NTA but I suppose that depending on the suit you could have been showing more than you expected / realized.  I can't see how this would be suggestive (unless you were giving some \"come hither\" looks) but I don't get that vibe from your post.", "NTA. I don't know because I don't know her personally, but her attitude comes across as jealousy.", "Sounds like the sister is jealous she isn\u2019t as impressive as you.", "NTA - your boyfriends sister needs to get over herself.", "NTA. You did an immense amount of training to have those skills and should be proud you can do it. I would ask her what it was suggestive of and what was inappropriate about it. Ask her if she's ever watched to Olympics and did she find that suggestive. Make her explain what she's trying to say is wrong.

What you were wearing at the time was chance on your side, and likely made it easier to show your flexibility anyway, so kind of good luck even. \n\nI would chalk it up to \u201cshe\u2019s uncomfortable,\u201d and not take it to heart as being innately \u201cinappropriate.\u201d", "NTA you were asked and complied. It might have made her uncomfortable, but it\u2019s an AH move to me to then text you about it you have to now  make  amends/be embarrassed.\n\nEveryone should let it go. I would be excited to see gymnastic moves lol. My friend was a cheerleader in college and it was always fun watching her flip around later on.", "NTA. From this story, it sounds like you were being normal & SHE was making it weird. Honestly, I think she owes you an apology for sexualizing you.", "Sorry, you being a gymnast", "Nta. Either the sister is  jealous of you or is in love with your bf.\n\nanyway she sounds like an entitled B", "NAH\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t have done that particular move in front of a mixed audience, but I\u2019m not gonna call you an asshole for it. I can also see why your bf\u2019s sister thought it was inappropriate, especially there were children there. I think the setting matters just as much as the action itself. Kinda like how wearing a bikini at the pool or beach with family isn\u2019t comparable to wearing just a bra/panties in somebody else\u2019s house. Yeah the same amount of skin is shown but it\u2019s almost about the expectation? Watching people do gymnastics in a leotard is one thing, but your boyfriends family prolly wasn\u2019t trying to see *your* bikini crotch at the pool.", "People care that you were a gymnast in college?", "Lol no!", "Yeah, nobody else said a thing", "Somewhere between that. There were kids around, I didn\u2019t really think of that as being a thing.", "Thanks, I will think about that.", "I agree.  There are plenty other poses and stretches OP could have done.  Yet OP does one that puts her business out there.  What if her swimsuit slipped?????", "Yeo there were kids around. But I didn\u2019t think of that as inappropriate for kids or anyone else, again maybe I am being naive.", "You may be right!", "Right?", "Ha, she\u2019s definitely American.", "I think that's a bit too harsh. I don't think there would have been any problem with anyone politely and discretely admiring OP. It's not like anyone wolf whistled. People are allowed to admire another person's body as long as they aren't being creepy about it.", "Exactly.", "Maybe I\u2019m just too used to this kind of thing.", "Ha, what is?", "I was wondering about that. The attention thing.", "Thank you.", "If only everyone had the same focus on their own lives as they did on analyzing the poses of others, the world would be a better place.", "She doesn\u2019t really act like it!", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.", "yea agreed NTA but very easily could\u2019ve had an accidental slip! I would just say OP should be careful in the future just to think slightly harder about possible wardrobe malfunctions", "Definitely wasn\u2019t come hither! But it was a normal smallish bikini.", "I\u2019m wondering.", "You\u2019re nice, but I haven\u2019t really picked up on that.", "Thank you! That means a lot.", "Ha! It was a normal bikini for these days.", "Found the insecure sister.", "If the bikini was an appropriate outfit to wear in that situation by the pool, I don't see why doing an athletic activity would make the outfit inappropriate. It doesn't seem that different from jumping into the pool or swimming around, etc.", "What do you mean?", "Are you saying it would be ok if she wore a burka? What is wrong with a bikini? Why are you slut shaming bikinis?", "She\u2019s married and her husband was there.", "That\u2019s a good way to put it, thanks.", "Ha, well thank you! I appreciate that. A lot of my friends are like that, lol", "Thanks for that.", "Oh thank you! People seem fascinated lol", "There\u2019s a weird fascination with it, yes.", "Then yes I\u2019d say maybe a soft Yta but only because the though that\u2019s comes to mind is that it\u2019s not a really secure piece and I\u2019d be worried about something being shown off. But otherwise if it had been more of a conservative cut I would\u2019ve seen no issue.", "Bf's sister is sexualizing what OP did by calling it inappropriate.", "OK, you know her and I believe you. Still NTA. \n\nI've suspected jealousy because it;s an easy answer. You're in great physical shape. That basic pose? I bet she can't do that. I surely can't ;-) If you see someone who is much better then you it's normal to feel a little jealous. It's not always bad, it could turn into positive feeling like admiration, but sometimes it's more like envy, especially if you're in similar age: \"Oh damn, I wish I could be like her but I'm not, so she shouldn't show she's better than me.\"", "I mean there\u2019s no other reason for her to be that way. Unless she\u2019s just really conservative. I wouldn\u2019t do that in front of my boyfriends family for two reasons, other women get really ticked off particularly moms and sisters and I can\u2019t do that lol. I use to have a boyfriend whose step mom despised me because I was \u201csuggestive\u201d by wearing a crop top. So I feel your pain. So from now on I kinda just stray away from being suggestive in any form so I don\u2019t piss off women in the family. Not that you should have to do that. But I just don\u2019t like confrontation, and women get jealous easily.", "Ah, there you go, she's more concerned about what her husband thinks about you. NTA", "She's probably blaming you for him looking at you. \nInstead of taking it up with him. \n\nNTA btw", "But how do they know unless you're always bringing it up, is my point?", "Ok that\u2019s fair, thank you!", "If someone present admired OP's body, is that them sexualizing her? Or is it that the problem is with the sister telling OP that the move was sexual and therefore inappropriate?", "Thank you for that. It\u2019s sad but I guess I get it! I just don\u2019t know if I should say something.", "That sucks! But I get it. Maybe I should do the same in the future.", "Eek. Ok.", "Ah. Hmm.", "I almost never bring it up! Others seem to.", "But that's their problem, not yours.", "You didn't answer the question, but cheers! Over it.", "True, but I hate the thought!", "People already know, and they bring it up. There\u2019s your answer."]}
