I can also see why your bf\u2019s sister thought it was inappropriate, especially there were children there. I think the setting matters just as much as the action itself. Kinda like how wearing a bikini at the pool or beach with family isn\u2019t comparable to wearing just a bra/panties in somebody else\u2019s house. Yeah the same amount of skin is shown but it\u2019s almost about the expectation?

Still NTA. \n\nI've suspected jealousy because it;s an easy answer. You're in great physical shape. That basic pose? I bet she can't do that. I surely can't ;-) If you see someone who is much better then you it's normal to feel a little jealous. It's not always bad, it could turn into positive feeling like admiration, but sometimes it's more like envy, especially if you're in similar age: \"Oh damn, I wish I could be like her but I'm not, so she shouldn't show she's better than me.\"", "I mean there\u2019s no other reason for her to be that way.

I bet cashy money all the people asking you about it were men. You didn't do anything wrong. I just suspect the motives of the people asking you about it, and the conversations they'll have about you and your \"flexibility\" when you're not around. The sister is gross for conflating athleticism with sex, but that's where some people go. Like it or not, you deliberately drew attention to your body in mixed company. Your motives may have been innocent. Not everyone will see it that way. I personally couldn't care less, but I can see a variety of views about a woman flashing her crotch, even if covered, and putting her leg behind her head in public. Would you do it at work? No. Would you do it at a family dinner? Probably not. People will have wildly divergent views on whether or not it's appropriate. Most people don't understand the training and the sport. They are't used to seeing people in poses like that. They are going to go straight to the gutter. Again, you're not at fault. People have dirty minds.", "NTA.

Unless, as someone suggested, she found it hot, and does not welcome those feelings. Or unless she found it so unseemly, she is weirdly embarrassed. \n\nI tend to think of my reactions as normal, but I realize that humans have a wide variation of reactions and things they find appropriate according to their family culture. However, for me, it would be really embarrassing to feel jealousy and insecurity, and then to actively call attention to it. Also, I\u2019m kind of used to that behavior with younger people who have these special skills and can do them\u2026 My daughter and her ballerina friend would do all sorts of interesting poses in photos, or during walks. Some of them actually make me a little nervous, like when they\u2019re doing something on a rock wall, but I just ignore it and figure they know their limits.", "YTA put your hoo ha away.", "The male mind is gonna do what it does. It can be shut down or stopped but it boots up as it\u2019s hardwired to. That being said, I think 2 things that make this a draw. \n1- think karate. What\u2019s done and practiced in the dojo may not look or seem appropriate when done  in a back yard and viewed by people who aren\u2019t familiar with it. \n2- this girls man guaranteed started down that thought process as a reflex. That\u2019s fine because as I said that\u2019s what men are hard wired to do whether they admit it or not. The problem here is that the girlfriend didn\u2019t seem to trust that he would be a good boy and shut it off. Maybe she doesn\u2019t understand a man\u2019s mind?", "NTA. I don't think this is suggestive at all. It's literally a basic move like you pointed out, and it wasn't like you did this unprompted.

I know you were asked if you know any moves, but it didn\u2019t mean you were forced to do the move.  You could have just said yes and moved on.  You shouldn\u2019t be sexualized, but on the other hand, lifting your leg behind your head  in a bikini exposed your vag to everyone without their consent.

She\u2019s jealous. Hopefully not of your relationship, but I\u2019ve seen sisters/moms behave like that with their sons\u2019 SOs. She\u2019s jealous she can\u2019t do it and that people were giving you attention for doing it. Not a deal breaker, as you aren\u2019t dating her directly, but something to keep an eye on imo. Women who need that much attention are exhausting.", "NTA. They asked you delivered and obviously made some people feel insecure because they can\u2019t do that and others were amazed.

Anyone sexualizing a normal thing you did related to topic conversation at the moment is weird.", "As long as there was no wardrobe malfunction I don\u2019t see the big deal\n\nNTA", "NTA,\n\nI wonder how your man would have felt if no one said anything negative. You are a trained gymnast. People sexualize women. And sure, people can think what they want, but I don\u2019t think you did anything obversely wrong here. \nMaybe the family is more conservative than it appears. And the swimsuit situation makes this another layer. I think the issue here is the family viewing it sexually. I think it would have been different if you had no formal training. So, you\u2019re NTA here. \nMoving forward, you might want to consider why someone is asking or the context to protect yourself. I\u2019d say something like, I don\u2019t have to prove myself and move on from it if you aren\u2019t sure or don\u2019t want to. And, Your boyfriend giving you the cold shoulder does not seem right, but not surprising. \nYour boyfriend seems to be processing what happened and how his family viewed you. If he\u2019s going be acting weird and cold, whatever on his part. In a perfect world, he needs to get over himself and tell his sister that there wasn\u2019t anything to it. Be proud of your gymnast skills. And that being said, I wouldn\u2019t feed into the negativity. If he tries to shame you, it might be something to think about. Be inquisitive about his thoughts when he does speak on it. But also, no need to shame yourself either and stand that you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \nMy point of view is that not everyone sees women and gymnastics or our form with innocent eyes. We are sexualized and people have different reactions to us in different settings. Does it make it right? No. But realistically, you have to be aware that not everyone is going to be understanding. But I also think that you aren\u2019t some loose person stretching out at a family gathering. There is a time and place for showing off.

My fist impression was more like a handstand split, which would be different. Thinking more now that people are commenting, she did a vertical split. That's less questionable, and would mostly depend on which way she was facing. Kids are normally further away when watching gymnastics and more importantly, know what they are about to see. Some people are more or less comfortable with it. I'm not saying op is in the wrong, but there's multiple factors at play so I think it's a case of \"you had to be there\".

Somehow showing your underwear under a skirt is different. Might get away with the dance floor since those moves can be crazy. There is a different set of appropriate level based on the context as well as the coverage. \n\nYou could reasonably argue the gymnastics is always a sport and is always in the context no matter what you are wearing, but you could also argue that the context of what everyone else is doing and the expectations and norms of that setting should influence you.\n\nI would never want a woman to be told she can't wear a swimsuit to a swimming party.
