Saying sure without thinking is for when someone asks if you want pizza for dinner, not when they ask to move into your house.

What in the world made this seem like a good idea? Also, kicking them out with no notice AND putting stuff out in the rain unprotected might have been a step too far.

They suck for being shitty roomies.  You suck cause you did not bother to research eviction rules in your area, and now you're at risk of a lawsuit if your parents are smart.", "YTA, that's not how you should have done it.

And I was all the way for you until the last few sentences.\n\nWho goes from no contact to, sure move in?  That was I\u2019ll advised to say the least.\n\nThey absolutely deserve to be kicked out.
