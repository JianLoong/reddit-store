We\u2019re both in college. We have other roommates, but they\u2019re currently not here, so they\u2019re irrelevant to this story. This happened about a week ago and it\u2019s still bothering me. \n\nJessica is one of those people that is the parentized oldest sibling. She\u2019s the kind of person that is extremely people-pleasing because she was relied on a lot growing up, and her family is obviously always asking for her help. I don\u2019t know much about her, but I know this \n\nShe has two young half-brothers (7M and 9M, I think?). They were staying over at the apartment for a few days for some reason. They\u2019re both really sweet and they mostly hang out in the living room watching TV and playing on their phones. We also live in a relatively safe area. \n\nMeanwhile, this girl I really like asked me out to a date. I can\u2019t describe how excited I was!! This would be my first date ever. She asked me out a week before the date. When the day came, I was about to leave the apartment to drive myself there. I then noticed that Jessica wasn\u2019t home, but her little siblings were. I texted Jessica, asking her how long she was going to be gone, and she told me that she was at her night shift, so not for a while. She then asked me to watch her siblings, but I told her that I had plans tonight. \n\nThis is when her tone completely changed, surprising tf out of me, and she sent a few passive aggressive texts before demanding that I watch her siblings for their safety. I told her \u201cno\u201d, since 1) I didn\u2019t agree to, 2) I had plans, and 3) the request wasn\u2019t made ahead of time; I had literally JUST found out that she expected me to watch them. I figured the kids would be fine and just left, and told her as such. \n\nThis ordeal made me a little late. While I was walking around with my date, I apologized for being late and explained what happened so she didn\u2019t feel disrespected. She was silent for a moment, and then she eventually gave me her take: she told me that, while my roommate was wrong too, staying home and watching those kids was still the right thing to do cuz of their safety. We could always plan another first date. \n\nAt least she was nice about her criticisms. Though I would like to say that the kids were indeed fine when I got back. Living room was a mess, but they themselves were in one piece. \n\nIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t see why I have to be responsible for two kids at the last minute with no consideration for my time and plans. I was extremely irritated, to say the least. In my eyes, it\u2019s Jessica\u2019s responsibility to find someone to watch those kids AHEAD OF TIME if she\u2019s not home (or not agree to let them stay at her apartment in the first place if she couldn\u2019t), not mine. But I\u2019m willing to change my mind and learn for the future if I made a rash, selfish, even dangerous mistake. \n\nSo, Reddit. AITA?

If she knew she was going to work she could\u2019ve asked if you could babysit if not, find an alternative but she just assumed you would because y\u2019all are roommates without taking consideration if you were going to be home.

ESH. This is tough. Most A is the roommate, that's stupid, expecting you to look after children without asking, or even telling you. That is seriously poor behaviour. But you going out, while understandable, was also poor. Your date was right, and she sounds nice. 7 & 9 year olds shouldn't be left alone. However, once you said you were going out Jessica should have come home, even if it got her in trouble at work this is her problem, not yours.  Make it clear to Jessica that if she leaves the children in your care again without your agreement you'll call CPS. Hope it goes well with your next date.", "NOPE! I would have called the police and CPS immediately. Fts. You aren't related, you aren't dating, you weren't asked, and it's not your job as roommate to have babysitting dumped on you.", "I would not have left those small kids alone personally, but your roommate is dumb as hell", "NTA.", "NTA but I don't know why you would tell your date that, it's not your obligation to look after them but it does kind of make you look bad", "You are not the AH.

That is horribly irresponsible and bullshit. She should not be watching those children if she is not going to be responsible for their wellbeing and also make sure they have proper care. \n\nYou need to have a putting your foot down conversation and explain that she put you in a terrible situation and if it happens again you\u2019re having the police come take custody of them until a parent or guardian retrieves them.", "The biggest ahole here is your roommate. Who just expects without asking that someone is going to watch children they are responsible for? \n\nYTA also though. Your right it wasn\u2019t your responsibility. Your right she should have asked first. However, you still left two kids not old enough to be home alone, home alone. \n\nYeah, it would have sucked to miss a date, but it was just that a date, that could be easily rescheduled. You weren\u2019t missing work, or an event like a concert or play in town for a limited time. It was a date. A date you were asked out on, so the girl clearly is in to you, so it is not like if you had to reschedule you would lose your opportunity with her either. You weren\u2019t canceling bc something better came up, it was an emergency situation, most people, like your date did, would understand that and not count it against you when it came to going out later. Those who would, you would be better off without anyway. \n\nIf it was me, since it was the first time it happened, I would have stayed with the kids. Maybe even invited the date over for takeout and a movie with the kids if you truly didn\u2019t want to miss out on hanging. When my roommate got home I\u2019d make it clear this was a one time courtesy, that in the future if she needs help you expect to be asked ahead of time, and agree to help. I\u2019d let her know if she pulled it again you be packing the kids up and dropping them off at her work. \n\nSome people suggest CPS, but that a bit extreme and hurts the kids. Dropping them off at her place of business puts the burden back on her to figure something out for children care, or be forced to leave work. Which guarantee, she won\u2019t pull it again.", "ESH, the roomate more than you. It's not ok to expect you to baby-sit without asking if you agree to, but it's also not ok to leave two kids under 10yo alone.", "ESH - yes, your roommate should have communicated better with you, and you shouldn't be expected to babysit, especially without warning.\n\nBut you knowingly left children alone, potentially endangering them,  just so you could have a hot date. You could have explained the situation and postponed the date until your roommate was back, set limits with your roommate later, and still gone on your date at some point. Now all you've done is demonstrated callousness and poor judgment to your new love intereet while treating innocent kids badly.\n\nI have more sympathy for the roommate- it sounds like she is trying to work and go to school while being sabotaged by her parents dumping her siblings on her. You don't have to be their sitter, but you could have shown some humanity and compassion in that moment.", "ESH.  Your roommate absolutely should have checked with you before heading for work to make sure you could watch the children.  However ... once you discovered the children were there, you absolutely should have canceled your first date and watched the kids.  Why?  Because the kids' safety is more important than your social life, and the ages of 9 and 7 are not quite old enough to leave the kids alone for the evening.  \n\nNow, once your roommate was home and the kids were safe?  That would have been the time to give your roommate a piece of your mind and completely dress her down for putting you in the position she did.  But in the moment,those kids' safety should have been first on your mind.", "YTA. You knew the children were staying with you for a few days, and you had a week\u2019s notice about the date. You didn\u2019t notice until it was time to leave that Jessica wasn\u2019t there, so who was checking in on the kids that entire time?  Jessica sucks too if she didn\u2019t make arrangements ahead of time, and her parents suck for constantly using her for free babysitting. But in the end, they were in your care, you were the only adult present, and it was highly irresponsible and potentially dangerous for you to just leave them. \n\nThe only responsible adult in this scenario appears to be the prospective girlfriend, but I would personally question the judgment of someone who would leave two small children alone so they could go on a date.", "Your date was right. Your roommate was an AH for putting you in that situation, but you don't leave little kids alone. You just don't do that. \n\nESH apart from your date. And the kids obvs.", "NTA  it's not your responsibility,  she never told you the kids where in the house alone and she doesn't now you that well , you perfectly can be a phedo, I don't know.  Don't let her siblings stay in the house again if she can't take care of them, your not a babysitter", "ESH. Your roommate should obviously never have left the kids in your apartment without checking with you; but your date was right: you made the choice to leave them alone after that.\n\nYou could have called her, explained the situation, and asked her to either come over and have an impromptu \"babysitting date\", or rescheduled. Then read your roommate the riot act when she came back from work.\n\nI get you were in a shitty situation. But you made the wrong choice here.", "YTA. Yes, you got put into this situation because of your roommate, who is even bigger YTA, but that doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. Its not fair to you, but sorry, you shouldn't have left.\n\nThe kids are not your responsibility, but think like a human. If you saw a baby sitting on train rails, would you leave it there because its not your responsibility?  I hope not....\n\nKids and responsibility for them belong to their parents but that doesn't mean that any grownup is absolved of responsibility when the parents are not around. Its just a human thing to make sure kids are safe.... It's just that simple.", "ESH\n\nShe should have asked in advance, and not assumed you could do it.  But you also should not have abandoned two young children.  Just like you wouldn't have just walked away from a fire burning in the kitchen.  You endangered those children, and your date was definitely not impressed with you", "ESH (except your date)\n\nJessica had no business leaving the kids in the house when she went to work, without having first spoken to you and asked if you could look after them, and you need to sit down with her and tell her that she absolutely cannot do that, and that if she wants you to watch the kids she needs to ask you well in advance and accept that the answer may be no. if she pushes back you may have to tell her that if it happens again then your will be calling the police to report the children as having been abandoned.  \n\nHowever, you cannot abandon a 7 & 9 year old. That's too young to be left alone for (it sounds like) several hours. Ideally you would have called your date, explained the situation and asked her if you could reschedule or if she could come over while you tried to track down Jessica or her parents to get the kids. \n\nYour date seems to have done exactly the right thing, she's not a AH, and Jessica is much more to blame than you, it sounds as though she just left without even telling you she was going or that the kids were there, which is inappropriate. I do have some sympathy for her if they were dumped on her by her family but that doesn't make it OK for her to abandon them and expect you to step in,", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Luckily they were fine. The people saying to call CPS are truly unhinged and must not have experience with this, are chronically online or don\u2019t have any children.

As much as it sucks, they\u2019re kids and they shouldn\u2019t be left alone. \n\nNo it\u2019s not your job to watch kids that aren\u2019t yours and aren\u2019t related to you. But in this situation, you were the only adult who was there and you basically said \u201cfuck these kids\u201d and left them alone. That wasn\u2019t cool. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole, your roommate is. But you do still kind of suck.", "NTA...BUT you are lucky the kids were ok....7 and 9 year Olds shouldn't be alone.....", "ESH, except for your date. Your roommate\u2019s parents most of all, with your roommate close behind. Next time this happens, call the police and tell them that your roommate left small children in your place without telling you, that you are not related to them, and you plan to leave. Call your date to say you are late, and wait for the police to arrive.", "Esh. The biggest asshole by far is your roommate for just expecting you to watch the siblings. However you are TA as well for leaving 2 young children unsupervised. It's not right or fair since they should not be your responsibility - but as an adult you can't just leave 2 kids in a potentially dangerous situation.", "You're pretty young, 20s are when we learn from our mistakes. The only one you made here was not calling the police to report child abandonment before going on your date. Remember that for next time", "NTA, but nor did you do the right thing in leaving them there unsupervised. \n\nAt their ages, they might or might not have needed supervision, but that\u2019s not your call to make.\n\nBasically, you discovered abandoned children. You shouldn\u2019t have left until they were safely in the care of their guardian, someone designated by their guardian, or authorities.", "INFO How old are the kids?", "ESH, unfortunately. You're young, it's fine, but yeah if no one was home you should have told the girl upfront that you were sorry, this was an unusual situation but you didn't want to leave two elementary aged kids on their own.", "You BOTH are AH\u2019s. It was NOT your responsibility and I can\u2019t believe your roommate did that. However, you knew they were alone and you still didn\u2019t care. Your date was right. In that moment it should not be about helping your roommate but doing the right thing by those kids. What if something did happen, that would be on your conscience. If my date told me this, it would make me reevaluate how I saw them. This would actually be a huge turn off for me and I wouldn\u2019t go out for a second date.", "ESH\nExcept your date of course\nNo matter how wrong your roommate is but you still left small kids home alone", "Soft YTA. You should have ubered the kids to her work and left them with her.", "I would've gathered the kids up and dropped them off at Jessica's job.", "What's tough about this? Police and CPS the end.", "Ahhhh yes punish the children for the actions of adults", "I think it could've been turned into a better first date:\n\n>Hey, this is going to sound weird, but as I was heading out, I just found out my roommate left her two young siblings behind with no one to watch them, and when I texted her, she told me that she had the nightshift and was expecting me to watch them. Even though she never asked me or even *told me* about that expectation, I just can't leave these two kids alone by themselves. How would you feel about hanging out at my place tonight?\\* We could order in, watch some silly family friendly movie and just get to know each other. I know it's not ideal, but I don't know what else to do since my roommate is refusing to take responsibility.\n\n\\*Since she knows the kids are there, presumably she won't think OP has something more seductive in mind.", "That wasn't child abandonment.... Actual child abandonment is devastating.", "7 and 9", "Do not just throw kids into an Uber wtf", "Yeah, ngl, I would never go on a date with you again if I found out your had left two kids alone in your apartment instead of just texting me that an emergency came up.\n\nThe children shouldn't be your responsibility but leaving them alone was wrong. And dangerous.", "Ohh bud, youre totally screwed. You basically told her you will make bad/dangerous decisions if something interfers with what you want. You also showed her you have no Ability to piviot. You should have called her and explained what happened given her the option to reschedule or offer to buy a pizza and watch a movie with the kids  and spun it like a fun highschoolesque date. Her friends are going to roast you.", "\"you're going to run out of friends pretty quickly\"\nOk but why would I want to stay friends with someone that pulls crap like leaving her siblings unattended on me and then demanding I watch them?", "It's because of how young and middle/upper class the user base is. They have no life experience.", "Its called child abandonment, it is 100% a police issue", "Ah yes, punish the children by\u2026 giving them to their parents via police and/or CPS. How awful it would be for them to be returned to their home because the person who was supposed to watch them didn\u2019t get childcare before going to work.", "No, PROTECT the children FROM the actions of adults.", "Oh, no. \n\nThat is a REALLY bad idea. You don\u2019t play house with strangers, and you certainly don\u2019t play house with kids that aren\u2019t your own. \n\nThese kids barely know OP, and definitely don\u2019t know OP\u2019s date. And who knows how well OP knows her date.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a cutesy rom-com.", "Yes! I would have been utterly charmed by a first date with someone this considerate and caring!", "Immediately call the cops next time so they can contact the parents to get the kids. She\u2019ll either learn to plan better, or will no longer be trusted with those kids\u2019 safety,", "I get that what the roommate did was crappy - im not arguing against it. But one persons crappy behaviour doesn't absolve OP from responsibility . Leaving kids alone is not the way to handle the roommats neglect.\n\nIts better to call the police than to leave them alone. That would also show the roommate that youre not going to take this kind of behaviour.", "Lying on a first date might not be amazing either.", "If it\u2019s the truth, then why not?\nYeah, it does sound bad.", "Uh, so lie so you don't *look* bad while the young kids are alone is your solution? The date made the right call here. I understand OP making a bad call in the moment but the fact that you're saying he should have continued his bad decision by lying is gross. Do better.", "Definitely the type of \u201cfriend\u201d one does not need.", "Is the idea that you shouldn\u2019t accept watching children when you already have responsibilities crazy to you? She should have never had the kids there in the first place, and if it was an absolute emergency she could have done the adult thing and you know\u2026 asked OP. I know sounds crazy.", ">Its called child abandonment, it is 100% a police issue\n\nWhen OP left the children by themselves *she* abandoned the children - as shitty as her roommate is, OP would be the one in trouble if anything happened to those kids. Once the kids were left in her care, whether or not she was ready for it or wanted it, they\u2019re her problem until she can make other adults responsible", "That wouldn't qualify in the court. It would just be a misunderstanding about childcare. Y'all are children.", "Even those who work within the system will tell you, it\u2019s broken. And should be used as a last resort. Not when a 7- and 9-yr old were left home alone for a few hours with zero incidents.", "You make a good point, but it actually seems *safer* than being *alone* with two kids that you don't know. (As a woman, OP is a less likely to be falsely accused, but one can never be too safe.)", "What I'm saying, in essence, is that it is unwise to outright tell people about bad things that you've just done when there is no reason to.", "That's not how it works, op had no responsibility for those children. The roommate leaving doesn't make Op responsible.", "OP never accepted to care for the children in the first place so she is incapable of abandoning them.", "A misunderstanding would require prior communication. There was no misunderstanding - there was just someone assuming someone else would do something for them without asking, and without notice. \n\nRoommate left her children unattended, even while OP was home, because OP didn't know roomie was gone. If there had been an issue and the kids were crying or got or something, OP might have ignored them thinking their mom was around to deal with it. \n\nThis is negligence. Plain and simple.", "Where did you read \u201efriend\u201c? I just read roommate. And you don\u2019t assume your roommate would watch your responsibility without a talk. That\u2019s ridiculous.", "I would ask the kids if they have mom or dad's number. OP did say that the roommate is parentified (please forgive that I don't recall the proper term at the moment), and we obviously don't know the entire story, but if parents are in the picture, they should be called."]}
