We\u2019re both in college. We have other roommates, but they\u2019re currently not here, so they\u2019re irrelevant to this story. This happened about a week ago and it\u2019s still bothering me. \n\nJessica is one of those people that is the parentized oldest sibling. She\u2019s the kind of person that is extremely people-pleasing because she was relied on a lot growing up, and her family is obviously always asking for her help. I don\u2019t know much about her, but I know this \n\nShe has two young half-brothers (7M and 9M, I think?). They were staying over at the apartment for a few days for some reason. They\u2019re both really sweet and they mostly hang out in the living room watching TV and playing on their phones. We also live in a relatively safe area. \n\nMeanwhile, this girl I really like asked me out to a date. I can\u2019t describe how excited I was!! This would be my first date ever. She asked me out a week before the date. When the day came, I was about to leave the apartment to drive myself there. I then noticed that Jessica wasn\u2019t home, but her little siblings were. I texted Jessica, asking her how long she was going to be gone, and she told me that she was at her night shift, so not for a while. She then asked me to watch her siblings, but I told her that I had plans tonight. \n\nThis is when her tone completely changed, surprising tf out of me, and she sent a few passive aggressive texts before demanding that I watch her siblings for their safety. I told her \u201cno\u201d, since 1) I didn\u2019t agree to, 2) I had plans, and 3) the request wasn\u2019t made ahead of time; I had literally JUST found out that she expected me to watch them. I figured the kids would be fine and just left, and told her as such. \n\nThis ordeal made me a little late. While I was walking around with my date, I apologized for being late and explained what happened so she didn\u2019t feel disrespected. She was silent for a moment, and then she eventually gave me her take: she told me that, while my roommate was wrong too, staying home and watching those kids was still the right thing to do cuz of their safety. We could always plan another first date. \n\nAt least she was nice about her criticisms. Though I would like to say that the kids were indeed fine when I got back. Living room was a mess, but they themselves were in one piece. \n\nIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t see why I have to be responsible for two kids at the last minute with no consideration for my time and plans. I was extremely irritated, to say the least. In my eyes, it\u2019s Jessica\u2019s responsibility to find someone to watch those kids AHEAD OF TIME if she\u2019s not home (or not agree to let them stay at her apartment in the first place if she couldn\u2019t), not mine. But I\u2019m willing to change my mind and learn for the future if I made a rash, selfish, even dangerous mistake. \n\nSo, Reddit. AITA?

If she knew she was going to work she could\u2019ve asked if you could babysit if not, find an alternative but she just assumed you would because y\u2019all are roommates without taking consideration if you were going to be home.

ESH. This is tough. Most A is the roommate, that's stupid, expecting you to look after children without asking, or even telling you. That is seriously poor behaviour. But you going out, while understandable, was also poor. Your date was right, and she sounds nice. 7 & 9 year olds shouldn't be left alone. However, once you said you were going out Jessica should have come home, even if it got her in trouble at work this is her problem, not yours.  Make it clear to Jessica that if she leaves the children in your care again without your agreement you'll call CPS. Hope it goes well with your next date.", "NOPE! I would have called the police and CPS immediately. Fts. You aren't related, you aren't dating, you weren't asked, and it's not your job as roommate to have babysitting dumped on you.", "I would not have left those small kids alone personally, but your roommate is dumb as hell", "NTA.", "[deleted]", "You are not the AH. No one should have to look after kids that they have not agreed to look after.

That is horribly irresponsible and bullshit. She should not be watching those children if she is not going to be responsible for their wellbeing and also make sure they have proper care. \n\nYou need to have a putting your foot down conversation and explain that she put you in a terrible situation and if it happens again you\u2019re having the police come take custody of them until a parent or guardian retrieves them.", "The biggest ahole here is your roommate. Who just expects without asking that someone is going to watch children they are responsible for? \n\nYTA also though. Your right it wasn\u2019t your responsibility. Your right she should have asked first. However, you still left two kids not old enough to be home alone, home alone. \n\nYeah, it would have sucked to miss a date, but it was just that a date, that could be easily rescheduled. You weren\u2019t missing work, or an event like a concert or play in town for a limited time. It was a date. A date you were asked out on, so the girl clearly is in to you, so it is not like if you had to reschedule you would lose your opportunity with her either. You weren\u2019t canceling bc something better came up, it was an emergency situation, most people, like your date did, would understand that and not count it against you when it came to going out later. Those who would, you would be better off without anyway. \n\nIf it was me, since it was the first time it happened, I would have stayed with the kids. Maybe even invited the date over for takeout and a movie with the kids if you truly didn\u2019t want to miss out on hanging. When my roommate got home I\u2019d make it clear this was a one time courtesy, that in the future if she needs help you expect to be asked ahead of time, and agree to help. I\u2019d let her know if she pulled it again you be packing the kids up and dropping them off at her work. \n\nSome people suggest CPS, but that a bit extreme and hurts the kids. Dropping them off at her place of business puts the burden back on her to figure something out for children care, or be forced to leave work. Which guarantee, she won\u2019t pull it again.", "ESH, the roomate more than you. It's not ok to expect you to baby-sit without asking if you agree to, but it's also not ok to leave two kids under 10yo alone.", "ESH - yes, your roommate should have communicated better with you, and you shouldn't be expected to babysit, especially without warning.\n\nBut you knowingly left children alone, potentially endangering them,  just so you could have a hot date. You could have explained the situation and postponed the date until your roommate was back, set limits with your roommate later, and still gone on your date at some point. Now all you've done is demonstrated callousness and poor judgment to your new love intereet while treating innocent kids badly.\n\nI have more sympathy for the roommate- it sounds like she is trying to work and go to school while being sabotaged by her parents dumping her siblings on her. You don't have to be their sitter, but you could have shown some humanity and compassion in that moment.", "ESH.  Your roommate absolutely should have checked with you before heading for work to make sure you could watch the children.  However ... once you discovered the children were there, you absolutely should have canceled your first date and watched the kids.  Why?  Because the kids' safety is more important than your social life, and the ages of 9 and 7 are not quite old enough to leave the kids alone for the evening.  \n\nNow, once your roommate was home and the kids were safe?  That would have been the time to give your roommate a piece of your mind and completely dress her down for putting you in the position she did.  But in the moment,those kids' safety should have been first on your mind.", "ESH. You knew the children were staying with you for a few days, and you had a week\u2019s notice about the date. You didn\u2019t notice until it was time to leave that Jessica wasn\u2019t there, so who was checking in on the kids that entire time?  Jessica sucks too if she didn\u2019t make arrangements ahead of time, and her parents suck for constantly using her for free babysitting. But in the end, they were in your care, you were the only adult present, and it was highly irresponsible and potentially dangerous for you to just leave them. \n\nThe only responsible adult in this scenario appears to be the prospective girlfriend, but I would personally question the judgment of someone who would leave two small children alone so they could go on a date.", "Your date was right. Your roommate was an AH for putting you in that situation, but you don't leave little kids alone. You just don't do that. \n\nESH apart from your date. And the kids obvs.", "NTA  it's not your responsibility,  she never told you the kids where in the house alone and she doesn't now you that well , you perfectly can be a phedo, I don't know.  Don't let her siblings stay in the house again if she can't take care of them, your not a babysitter", "ESH. Your roommate should obviously never have left the kids in your apartment without checking with you; but your date was right: you made the choice to leave them alone after that.\n\nYou could have called her, explained the situation, and asked her to either come over and have an impromptu \"babysitting date\", or rescheduled. Then read your roommate the riot act when she came back from work.\n\nI get you were in a shitty situation. But you made the wrong choice here.", "YTA. Yes, you got put into this situation because of your roommate, who is even bigger YTA, but that doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. Its not fair to you, but sorry, you shouldn't have left.\n\nThe kids are not your responsibility, but think like a human. If you saw a baby sitting on train rails, would you leave it there because its not your responsibility?  I hope not....\n\nKids and responsibility for them belong to their parents but that doesn't mean that any grownup is absolved of responsibility when the parents are not around. Its just a human thing to make sure kids are safe.... It's just that simple.", "ESH\n\nShe should have asked in advance, and not assumed you could do it.  But you also should not have abandoned two young children.  Just like you wouldn't have just walked away from a fire burning in the kitchen.  You endangered those children, and your date was definitely not impressed with you", "ESH (except your date)\n\nJessica had no business leaving the kids in the house when she went to work, without having first spoken to you and asked if you could look after them, and you need to sit down with her and tell her that she absolutely cannot do that, and that if she wants you to watch the kids she needs to ask you well in advance and accept that the answer may be no. if she pushes back you may have to tell her that if it happens again then your will be calling the police to report the children as having been abandoned.  \n\nHowever, you cannot abandon a 7 & 9 year old. That's too young to be left alone for (it sounds like) several hours. Ideally you would have called your date, explained the situation and asked her if you could reschedule or if she could come over while you tried to track down Jessica or her parents to get the kids. \n\nYour date seems to have done exactly the right thing, she's not a AH, and Jessica is much more to blame than you, it sounds as though she just left without even telling you she was going or that the kids were there, which is inappropriate. I do have some sympathy for her if they were dumped on her by her family but that doesn't make it OK for her to abandon them and expect you to step in,", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Luckily they were fine. The people saying to call CPS are truly unhinged and must not have experience with this, are chronically online or don\u2019t have any children.

Make it clear what the consequences will be if she ever pulls that again and show her what it's supposed to be like when someone says no and sets a boundary. Will you call her parents? Drop the kids at her place of employment? Contact the police? Whatever it is, stand by that decision and make her accept her own responsibilities.

Jessica needs to stop using you.", "NTA. She shouldn't have agreed to watch the kids for a few days without having plans for how they would be cared for, especially when she knew she was going to be away from home working. That necessarily implies that she was relying on you to fill in the gaps, and the fact that she did not communicate it makes her an AH.\n\nAlthough, YCBTA if she had already run all this by you and you still decided to impulsively schedule a date during that crucial window.\n\nAlso your date seems like a decent person, you will need to do some image cleanup with her because I guarantee she is not impressed by how you handled that.", "ESH, but Jessica\u2019s parents are the biggest AHs. You and roommates need to have a conversation about her siblings staying over.  She should NEVER EVER leave them alone.  None of you should ever agree to be responsible for them.  You need to set that boundary today.  Honestly, it would be best if it was collectively decided that the siblings weren\u2019t welcome there.  Obviously, they are good kids, so it\u2019s not because of their behavior, but because of the liability of having them around others who are rightfully unwilling to be responsible for them.\n\nJessica is an AH for just leaving them alone and then demanding that you watch them after she has already left, leaving you in an incredibly shitty situation.\n\nYou are a bit of an AH for initially leaving them alone.  I\u2019m glad your date convinced you to go back.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get Jessica to agree to NEVER do that again, consider moving or working with other roommates to get her off the lease.", "ESH. She abandoned the kids and you never would have even known if you didn't text her about it. However, you did text her about it, and then also abandoned them. You should have at least called CPS and the police or dropped them at her workplace because SOMEONE needed to be watching them. If something had happened it would have been legally your fault because you knew they were there and left them alone.", "ESH. Obviously your roommate is the main AH here. She should have made arrangements ahead of time, and definitely shouldn\u2019t have left without telling you. If you hadn\u2019t noticed she was gone, you might have gone on your date and neither of you would have known the kids were there alone. Did they have a phone or know who to call in an emergency? This could have ended very badly. Make sure she understands that this is never to happen again.\n\nHowever, once you discovered that the kids were in your care, you became responsible for them. It sucks and it\u2019s not fair, but their safety was more important than your date. You would have been justified in demanding Jessica come home, or dropping them off at her workplace for her to deal with. You could have even called the police, but you should not have left the kids alone.", "ESH. you left two small children unattended. Your roommate caused the situation, but you handled it poorly.", "ESH Your roommate should have asked you if you were available to watch the kids.

OP *did* know the kids were there alone.", "Then maybe adults that are responsible for children should be, I don\u2019t know, *responsible*.
