This kid grew up with a niece whose suffering he had to live with and likely will never fully forgive his brother.  Therapy would help everyone, but your oldest seems like someone who will never change.  Maybe, if he gets sick and the other kids have abandoned him, he will offer a token apology. \n\nGood for taking the son out for ice cream. But when you do take that kind of route, you need to have a talk about how to express feelings more healthily. \n\nThere is an argument for ESH but i won't go there because I'm sure you did your best in a terrible situation for the last 16 years.", "Nta but why why WHY are you letting him around your grand daughter???

My oldest got offended and told him not to speak about his kids like that to which my youngest answered with some curse words that I can't say here.\n\nNow I understand that your youngest son feels a lot of anger towards his older brother because of his decision to abandon his daughter in favour of his wife, but perhaps you should talk to your youngest son about how he reacts around your grandsons, it's really not healthy for him to take out his anger on them because of their father's decision. \n\nThey are just children after all and have no association with their father's wrongdoing, so perhaps he could find it in his heart and accept them as family one day. \n\nBut if he doesn't want to then it's his decision. \n\n\n>My oldest asked me what I'm going to do about him and I told him that I will probably take my youngest out for an ice cream to make him feel better\n\n>My oldest and my wife think we are all assholes and my wife is giving me the silent treatment\n\nYour oldest son's wife is the true AH and he's no better than her really, as for your wife...

Your not a bad guy cause your oldest basically did the same with picking and choosing which kids to support.\n\nI feel like your Wife and Son are more focused on the yelling and name calling of the kids, than your youngest calling out your oldest. \n\nThe statement about the kids were just the hammer to the nail about your two sons relationship and thoughts about each other and sadly the kids got in the cross fire of those words. \n\nI would have a conversation with youngest explaining that you can whatever you want about brother.

Wife has a golden child eldest... Your golden child is Youngest. \n\n\nYall both need to stop playing favourites also who is paying for your granddaughter does eldest pay you child support because he should be and he owes back support from the time he was 18. which can go to granddaughter for school. \n\nESH", "YTA\n\nYour youngest doesn't have to accept his nephews as close family, but you are rewarding him for being mean to children who had no hand in making this situation.", "I don't know about a judgement here.  The littles aren't responsible for what their father has done in the past.  They shouldn't be punished for his crimes.  However, they're old enough to know they shouldn't go into another person's personal space without permission (at least the 11 year old was).  That was on them.   Your younger son had every right to evict them from the room and confront their father over their invasion of his space.  The littles don't deserve to be treated badly by the young man though and they're being hurt through no fault of their own.\n\nSo the older son is financially responsible for his daughter.  That's good.  Is he a true father to her in other ways?  I doubt it since he allowed his new wife to determine where she lived.  Frankly, she's probably safer with you than with them, but that's another matter.  \n\nI don't know about rewarding the youngest for the behavior.  That's an AH move especially if said for the littles to hear.  (Once again, none of this is their fault).    However, if said in partial jest because the older son is showing favoritism and the littles didn't hear it, that's not such a bad thing.  \n\nThe true AHs here are your eldest son and his wife.   But you're walking on thin ice making young children pay for their father's mistakes.   The sins of the father aren't on these innocent children.  Don't make them pay.  It's unfair and you should know that.\n\nUnder the circumstances and since I don't know where the littles were when the words were said I'm asking for INFO before issuing a judgement.", "YTA, as much as I hate to say it. I mean, you raised your granddaughter, which you didn't have to do, and sound like you're a man who loves your family. But, yes, you're the AH.\n\nThe story about your son does show how selfish and immature he was. However, that was also 16 years ago. I'm assuming he was very young then. Is it really relevant to the story that just happened? Did you share that story to prejudice us against him? Or did you share it because you just can't forgive your son for what he did when he was younger, and you want to keep hurting him with it when you can?\n\nYour youngest son yelled at his nephews. You seem to think that's OK because, 16 years ago, your older son made a very terrible choice and doesn't seem to regret it. You're holding onto this anger from 16 years ago. It seems like you're proud of your son and granddaughter for treating your oldest son and his newer children badly. How long do you want your oldest son to be punished for? How long is it acceptable for everyone to be angry?\n\nYour son did make a big mistake. It probably is hard to forgive him when he doesn't seem to feel bad about it. I think you should consider going through therapy to help heal and reach forgiveness. It's not necessarily for the fact that your oldest son deserves forgiveness, but more that you can't move on and be happy in your life until you learn to forgive him. Really, it's not good for anybody for your younger son and granddaughter to feel like they need to be spiteful towards your older son to please you. Is that how you want your family to be?", "YTA. What happened was horrible and I feel for your granddaughter but you are setting a bad example for your youngest son. You need to teach him a better outlet for his anger then lashing out and screaming. Rewarding him for acting like this will tell him that lashing out like this is okay and it will become how he deals with his anger more often than not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn't matter how much his son's wife had to do with it the oldest son is responsible. I agree if OP can't cut contact he needs to figure out his own emotions because it seems he's passive aggressive and accepting of inappropriate behavior toward the son due to his anger. Even if that means OP having a conversation stating his disapproval with the oldest son. If my son exhibited this behavior I'd take my granddaughter in to protect her and every time he came over I would have a chat with him.
