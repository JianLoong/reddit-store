She has completely (as far as she can according to the doctor) healed from the physical injuries but we are still working on the mental aspect because it is very bad.\n\nMy wife has a sister Regina(45) and a brother Calvin(47). Regina had a son 2 years after my wife woke up from a coma and decided to name him James, the name of my late FIL.

We now have 6 other nephews and nieces, and while my wife is very close with all of them, she isn't that close with James (he is 18 now). He has noticed this a lot and finally he asked me and Will, the real reason why my wife isn't as close with him (We gave him a watered down version). We told him the reason why and he was horrified.

Ex: she didn't babysit him as often, she didn't take him on fun stuff alone as often (Ex he would get 1-2 a month alone while my other nephew got 2-3 times). Other than that they have an good relationships. She might not talk to him on bad days, but she does that to Calvin too because he looks so much like FIL.\n\nGods people, I'm asking if I shouldn't have told my nephew the truth. I know where my wife stands in part of the conflict so I don't need any judgements on her.\n\nThe reason my nephew was given by Regina is that my wife isn't as close to him because he was born so soon after the accident and that they didn't bond", "created_utc": 1683202398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137is8y/aita_awta_for_telling_our_nephew_why_my_wife_isnt/", "score": 7114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was bedridden in the hospital for years then struggled with her mental health, which I doubt would have massively changed had James not been called James. \n\nHow many other nephews and nieces did she bond with during those ten years?  Is she close to another nephew the exact same age as James? \n\nBy saying the issue is only his name, you are squarely placing the blame on his mother, who you clearly dislike.  It's vindictive and also dishonest and doing no favours to anyone.  That the name is a factor? Sure.  That it's the only reason?  Nope.  YTA\n\n~~I N F O : What exactly do you mean by \"~~*~~the end result was not pretty\"?~~*  ~~Did naming her son James massively hinder your wife's progress?  Or did you wife decide to take out her trauma on James? Did you know that it would be terrible? Or was everyone being overprotective of your wife?~~\n\n~~SIL lost her father under truly tragic circumstances and nearly lost her sister.  I can't blame her for desperately wanting to honour him with her son's name.  For me this all kinda depends how bad the fallout was, how long it lasted and just how much SIL knew before choosing the name.~~\n\n~~Like your wife can't hide from the name James her whole life.~~", "So it's your sister in law's fault for naming her son after her late father (an incredibly common thing,  no matter how tragic the death) that your wife chose not to get close to her nephew? For 18 years,  he had to watch his aunt chose his other cousins over him and when he finally had the courage to ask why, his reaction to the answer was to abandon his mother?  That doesn't track.", "YTA. The \u201creal reason\u201d? what does that even mean? That his grandfather passed away in a tragic car accident that also hurt your wife. So his mother decided to honor her father and name James after him? None of that is scarring and only paints your wife in a bad light. Your SIL is no villain for naming her son after her father. Like wtf?", "INFO \n\nYour wife went through a traumatic ordeal, and I'm glad she's on the path to healing. \n\nHer siblings also lost their father, which is traumatic. I don't understand why your wife is upset that her nephew has the same name as her father. It's reasonably common, especially when the grandfather has passed away. Everyone seems to have agreed it was a bad idea, including the nephew, but I don't understand why. \n\nYou say you \"can't share everything\", but the bit that's missing seems to be the important part.", "\nEdit: YTA.   Your SIL lost her father tragically and later decided to name her child after him to honor him. I can understand why the reminder might have been hard for your wife since your update makes it sound like your wife carries a lot of guilt about the accident, but that doesn\u2019t mean your SIL was wrong.\n\nAlso, it makes no sense why this would make James hate his mother unless you spun the story hard in your/your wife\u2019s favor.\n\nOriginal: i n f o: Why was it so bad that Regina named her son after her late father?", "What the actual fuck is this bullshit!? Y\u2019all treat the one nephew different because he\u2019s named in honor of his dead grandfather? Your wife, a full grown adult, can\u2019t handle hearing the name of her own dead father *years* after he died? And all the adults in his life are o-fucking-kay enabling your wife\u2019s immature-as-fuck bullshit? And you claim her *doctor* agreed with this malarkey? Why y\u2019all hate him and his mother?\n\nAll y\u2019all are assholes. Huge ones. \n\nYTA", ">I can't share everything but it ended up causing her going into a coma for a few years.\n\nINFO Is the missing info that FIL caused the accident on purpose or was driving drunk or something...because I can't understand why everyone would be so horrified about naming the nephew after the FIL otherwise.", "I'm so confused.  If your goal was to force me to read this 3x, congratulations.\n\nWhy is naming him James a a big deal?  Is that the dead father's name?  Was this a gross-negligence accident and we hate the corpse?", "YTA.\n\nYour wife\u2019s mental health isn\u2019t her fault but is her responsibility. From your post she has been using her mental health as an excuse to irrationally exclude and punish your nephew because of his name. \n\nThis is a classic case of people tip-toeing around mental health rather than facing it properly. I can appreciate it may have been difficult after waking up from the coma and during the nephews early years when getting used to it but for this behaviour to still be happening 18 years later is absurd. Your wife is an adult punishing a child for no reason.\n\nThe entire family is giving credence to your wife\u2019s irrational thoughts which is making it all worse. And you have explained it in a way to your nephew which does make his mother out to be a villian. Apparently the sister is the only one of you capable of applying objective and rational thought. Your wife\u2019s behaviour is hers to control not her sisters.\n\nEdit: OP Your edit makes the situation worse not better. What younare saying is the treatment of your nephew has been subtly worse for 18 years which has meant he has questioned why for 18 years without anything definitive to be able to ask the question of why and when he did it turns out he wasnt crazy and you WERE treating him different and then you blamed this young persons treatment on his mother for some reason.", "Am I right in understanding that your wife has treated this one nephew as a pariah because her sister named him after their late father?\n\nIf so, YTA (or more accurately,  Your wife is TA). The kid didn't get to choose his name, he at least deserved to be treated as a member of the family.\n\nI understand why your wife has a problem with the name, no doubt, and I completely see why she takes issue with her sister over it, but taking it out on the innocent party is the absolute wrong thing to do.", "YTA - Your wife is, and youre the AH for telling James this. So this child was named after his grandfather who died tragically. That seems like a lovely way to honor his memory, and something very common that people do. Why are you punishing this kid by treating him differently?\n\nEdit - clarified judgment", "I'm confused as to what your wife's sister did wrong and why her son would be mad.", "I'm so sorry to ask but what is your wife's mental state? Does she have some association with the name/accident?\n\nEdit:\n\nYeah nah  just read your copy reply.\n\nShe needs to grow up. She doesn't own the name. Regina does have the right to remember her own dad.\n\nUNLESS your wife has an acquired brain injury and has very diminished capacity in which ew, boo you. Stop fucking her.", "YTA if you think it's acceptable to ostracize one nephew because he was named in honor of a relative who died. Your wife needs a better therapist if she gets triggered by someone with the same name that she excludes them. You all suck for thinking that's okay for her to do and acting like Regina was wrong to honor her father.", "I don\u2019t understand. Where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s very common to name a child in honor of a deceased relative. It seems like YTA in making this a huge deal.", "INFO: can you explain more about the note about names in your culture? Also, can you explain why this seemingly beautiful tribute upsets your wife\n\nReading this my gut reaction is YTA, because people are allowed to name their children after their deceased fathers. It seems like a family name.", "INFO: he was named after his late grandfather and didn\u2019t know? Or he was told nobody wanted his mom to name him that?", "Your wife is the asshole here, by a mile.", "YTA as is your wife. Regina\u2019s father died as well. She lost her dad and watched her sister be in a coma for years, waiting for her to wake up. She got pregnant and wanted to honour her dad by naming her son after him. Your wife\u2019s mental health means she made the shitty choice to treat poor James as less than because of his name. I sympathise with someone who s clearly struggling mentally but this was a shitty thing to do. Telling James that this is all his mothers fault is both untrue and cruel, you\u2019ve damaged his relationship with his mum because your wife can\u2019t handle him having the same name as his grandfather. You could have explained that your wife is still suffering and can\u2019t always handle company but no, Regina is terrible for naming her son after her father five years after said father\u2019s death. \n\n\nYou owe Regina an apology and you owe James one too. Take responsibility for your actions- both of you. Your wife chose for more than a decade to treat James as less than- that\u2019s on her, not Regina. Now after her crappy actions she blames her sister? Assholes, both of you.", "I'm confused by the edit, too. He was born \"so soon after the accident\"? But she was in a coma for years after and he was born two years after she woke up. So how does that make any sense?\n\nAnd yes, YTA for telling your nephew this BS \"reason.\" And I don't understand what caused the problems with his mother. Because he was named after his grandfather several years after the grandfather died?", "YTA it is incredibly common to name children after a loved one who passed. And she did it years later, not right away when emotions might still be very raw. I don\u2019t understand the issue. Unless the sister actually caused her father\u2019s death this is completely normal.", "And this tragedy didn\u2019t just happen to your wife. While her situation may have been significantly more traumatic, her siblings also lost their father. Maybe it helps the sister with her grief to honor her father by naming the child after him. Seems like everyone is mad at the sister and using her child to punish her. Everyone but James sounds like an AH.", "Regina's father died as well - I'm sorry, but your wife doesn't come out looking too good in this story. I don't understand what Regina did wrong, so your attitude towards her does make you TA in my opinion.", "YTA - this was not your situation to handle. You stuck your head into the situation. Your SIL had every right to name her child after her own father\u2026 none of you had the right to even dissuade her from that bc your wife has her own struggles. Maybe suggest that your wife works in therapy bc her own choices and behaviors have caused pain and divide for everyone else bc she hasn\u2019t been able to cope. Her behaviors are not other peoples faults. The nephew shouldn\u2019t be upset more at their parent than the person who ostracized them bc they couldn\u2019t cope.", "YTA- and sadly, so is your wife. Hating a child because of his name is ridiculous.", "Yta. And this whole story is odd. I can\u2019t imagine a therapist giving their opinion on what a relative should name their child,  did he advise a notice in the local newspaper to inform everyone within a certain radius that the name James is now forbidden. Your sister in law is allowed to name her child after their deceased father. It\u2019s an extremely common way of honouring them.", "YTA and so is your wife - her sister should be able to honor her late father and it's not your poor nephew's fault what name he was given so it was very wrong of your wife to treat him any differently than the rest of her niblets.", "Maybe your wife is the assshole? Why would she losing some poor baby/kid and be hurtfully distant for a name he didn\u2019t even choose for himself?", "YTA", "YTA for explaining it as \"Your mom shouldn't have named you that\".\n\nI dont think your wife is an AH. She spends time when she can but ultimately if she can't deal with it she can't deal with it. Even with therapy and help she might never get over that guilt, and I noticed you said she's recovered as much as she can. Major accident and coma for two years? She might literally not be able to fully overcome her trauma for medical reasons. \n\nYour SIL is def not an AH because yeah, the name might affect your wife, but it's how she dealt with her fathers death, kept him alive, honored him. That's completely reasonable. Realistically how could she think your wife would still be this affected? \n\nHow you SHOULD HAVE explained it: \"Wife is distant because the accident was very traumatic, and between her emotions and medical whatever she has a really hard time coping with hearing her father's name. She is still working on it (I hope) and she might never get past it but in the end that's on her to work through or deal with and we're both sorry for any effect it has on you. She loves you, she has a hard time dealing.\" Or something on those lines. But the \"blame\" should be on your wife. Her fault might be justified but it's still hers.\n\nSide note: Is a nickname possible? Maybe something completely unrelated or not James shortened. Like \"Firstborn\" or his favorite food or something.", "ESH- I'm in the middle on whether you should've told him, but I feel like he would wonder why he was being treated as a lesser than. I do think your SIL probably shouldn't have named him that, but it is what it is. And to some, it's a way to honor a deceased loved one.\n\nHowever, your wife is 100% TA. Treating one child different over a name and another because of how they look is immature. I get where it comes from, but 18 years? She needs to get over herself and grow up. No offense, but I think your wife is trash for treating a child differently over something they can't control. Does she not think it's wrong? Have you not ever tried to check her on it? The world does not revolve around your wife's feelings.\n\nYou and your SIL- ehhhhhh\n\nYour wife: YTA 10,000%", "YTA and your wife is as well.   It is irrational for her to behave this way.  She needs to seek therapy.  No adult should take her trauma out on a child.   \n\n I also do not believe he would leave home because of the situation.  I am sure he knew he was gone and why.  I am sure his mother explained why she named him that way.  This is either fake or you are not a reliable narrator.", "YTA and so is your wife. For her to dislike her nephew strictly because he was named after his late grandfather is ludicrous. I understand she went through some things, but so did the rest of the family. Naming her first born after her late father doesn\u2019t seem out of bounds. Disliking him because of his name, absolutely is.", "Your wife is TA. Isolating James and making him feel different for his whole childhood for his name is awful.", "I mean, it is super common to name your child after one of the grandparents, especially someone you loved dearly who is no longer with you. My daughter is named after my grandmother and my son is named after my dad (still living). \n\nWhy on earth is your wife taking it out on her nephew decades later? He was named after his mother's father, very clearly someone who his mother loved and respected in life. This just doesn't make sense from you or your wife's side. YTA.", "Going with YTA. Regina lost her father in a tragic accident and wanted to honor him by giving her son his name. Very common for children to be named to honor family members. You all tried to bully her into choosing something else which I don't understand.  She didn't do this to be hurtful but that's how you all made it seem.\n\nThen your wife holds this in her heart and puts only 1 nephew at arms length until he finally says something. You step in and blame his mother for this causing a huge issue. That sir makes you the asshole.", "YTA a bit, but not for telling the truth. Not 'allowing' the kid to be named after your FIL and having the kid for that is why. His mother did nothing wrong.", "Whilst it is nice to be considerate of others it is not the duty of others to be responsible for someone else's trauma and mental health. What your wife went threw is terrible. But the SIL also lost her father and whilst your wife at the time had only been healing from it for 2 years it had been so much longer for her sister. Your wife was concentrating so much on the person she lost that she missed out on the person that was there. Whilst there's no time frame for grief when its creating barriers in personal relationships years after the fact then serious help and healing need to be done. Instead of being responsible for her mental health she blamed the sister and thats not right. YTA and your wife for letting it get to this situation and causing unnecessary hurt to a kid that did no wrong.", "NTA for telling James why there is this rift.\n\nEveryone is approaching this wrong. This all sounds complicated, but given the trauma from the accident (which I know you couldn\u2019t fully explain), the aspect of the coma, the fact that the name was unusual, and the fact that \u201cJames\u201d blew up, it seems like something bad and unfair to your wife went on with the naming.\n\nThe narrow question here is whether you two are TA for telling your nephew this family history. No.", "I don't think you are an AH.\n\nMy judgement is based on the perspective of your wife and WHY this relationship is the way it is.\n\nMy personal experience is I have a lot of mental health issues and those mental health issues can cause impulsive, erratic behavior.  You said your wife has a lot of trauma, which does have an impact on her relationships, and how she behaves around people.  I got treatment for my trauma and it helped me accept things so I could treat people better.\n\nIt sounds like your wife kept distance with him because of her own grief, but that is not fair to James.  That is a special name, one to honor and remember for your family and your family can use it, that's not the issue I see.   Names get passed down, it's a beautiful thing, but your wife treated him different for it and that's not fair to him, she has to find a way to accept this part of him and treat him like an individual he is.  Her feelings don't dictate what other people do.\n\nJames has a right to know if what he observed is true, and you told him the truth, I do not think that was wrong.\n\nJames and your wife need to repair their own relationship and I think that although her mental health might be clouding her decisions, the name causes her a lot of grief, which isn't fair to James at all, but it says to me your wife is still very much struggling and may need some other additional help and treatment.\n\nI have mental illnesses, that is my experience in life.  I know what they do to you, they destroy you, they mess with your head, your psyche.  You question everything and everything is a trigger or reminder of pain.\n\nThe responsibility falls on your wife for how she treated James, he didn't deserve that.  You told him the truth, I respect that.\n\nHis reaction is his own and he is allowed.  I think it is up to James to decide the relationship, which he has every right to do.  It's up to your wife to address her mental health and decide if she wants a relationship with him, but sometimes bonds just don't form and we can't control that.  All we can say is, how do we walk forward, what can we do to find solutions.\n\nI am sorry your wife is struggling so much.  Mental health is unpredictable and hard to understand.  Maybe in time with continued treatment, her trauma will subside and things can be better, but James is allowed to be mad and should make this decision himself.  It is up to him now.\n\nEdit: People can get better and with healing comes acceptance and in that sense the wife could find healing from her trauma and build a better relationship with him.  That's all I'm saying.", "I\u2018m going with a soft YTA. Your wife was/is traumatised and grieving, her sister was also grieving and probably wanted to honour her father. The way you phrased the explanation to your nephew does paint his mother in not so good light and I see no reason for that.", "YTA and so is your wife. \n\nNaming a child in honor of a deceased family member is not outrageous, treating a child like shit because of their name absolutely is.", "NTA for telling the truth \nBut you are an asshole for letting your wife do that.\n\nyour sail has every right to name her kid in Honor of her dead father \nI\u2019m sorry your wife has trauma \nThat is not her sisters burden to bare \nYour wife has had over a decade to get therapy instead of treating her nephew so differently that he noticed. \nIt has been years \nYou and your wife should\u2019ve gone to therapy, some anything to make that not happen \n\nEven if your mad at sil for naming him that.

He had always been adamant that it didn't matter. Husband was 32.", "If that\u2019s why James is mad then OP has likely not provided a balanced view of what happened. Going off of OPs responses, he doesn\u2019t think telling his nephew his wife\u2019s view of the truth was a jerk move (it was). So I don\u2019t trust that he gave a reasonable, or particularly true, explanation to James", "Absolutely! I have CPTSD for similar reasons. Trauma is a reaction, and frequently that reaction can\u2019t be controlled. Especially if the trauma is more severe or the person is naturally more reactive.", "Because 18 year olds are beacons of reason and logic?\n\nEvery other post on this sub, we have late teenagers and early twenty somethings tell each other and grown adults to cut people off for very minor reasons. Yesterday, a father posted about how his 13 year old wasn't coming to his house anymore because he couldn't be on social media for five hours every Saturday. The sub reamed him hard, and Saif \"when he cuts you off completely at 18, you don't get to be surprised!\" It got so bad that people on the post were saying the same/worse about that OP not letting his kids eat dessert if they didn't eat their dinner. Yknow the majority of people on this sub? People in their young twenties and late teens.\n\nIt's not at all outside of the realm of possibility that an 18 year old is being that hateful and petty.", "Yeah, but then the entire family were bunch of bullies. Cause naming a kid after deceased grandpa is super normal.", "Actually, you make an excellent point.  It\u2019s a scary new world out there compared to when I was 18.  Wow.  Glad I keep my kids off all social media - and they\u2019re totally fine with it and regularly complain to me about the latest \u201cdrama\u201d at school caused by - yup, stupid social media/echo chamber internet.", "Sure, but whats not super normal is for your dad to die in a horrific accident that also nearly killed your sister. And it\u2019s also not super normal to do so while your sister is still recovering from said accident.\n\nAlso, i don\u2019t really see how telling someone that if you do this thing, it\u2019s going to cause a problem that\u2019s easily avoidable is bullying. Personally I see watching your sister go through a traumatic event and wanting to shove a constant reminder of it while they haven\u2019t even finished healing from it is worse but to each their own I guess.", "Right? It\u2019s like the plot of a Disney movie.", "This was my question as well. \n\nWhy would James be angry (let alone \"hate\") his mother because his aunt is triggered by his name? If I were James, I might be rather resentful of Aunt for treating me with less love and care than my siblings and cousins over a name that I didn't pick for myself. \n\nThere was nothing wrong with naming him after his grandfather. I'm sure his mother thought Aunt would get over it soon. I understand PTSD and TBI and I'm not passing judgment on Aunt over the fact that it didn't turn out that way, but James's mother is NTA for naming him that. I'm sure it meant as much to her to honor her late father as it did for Aunt to somehow feel nobody else should be allowed to have that name.", "I'm not a big fan of the wife either but you don't need to be that harsh, yikes", "You think the wife is an asshole for being in a traumatic event and losing her father at the age of 17? You think that type of shit just disappears because her nephew has his feelings hurt for not getting attention?", "Tell him what, exactly? There's no way this kid didn't know who he was named after, so what exactly did OP tell him and why in the world would everyone have a problem with a daughter naming her first kid after her father? This post feels like some of the laziest fiction I've ever read.", "I have CPTSD due to childhood sexual abuse. Please do not think that everyone responds to trauma the way you do. I\u2019ve been in therapy for decades and I still can\u2019t stand it when people come up behind me where I can\u2019t see them. Avoiding triggers isn\u2019t maladaptive and it isn\u2019t avoiding the problem. It can absolutely be a necessary coping mechanism.\n\nTry to have more compassion and less judgment for other people with PTSD. I never though I\u2019d encounter someone with PTSD who had an ableist attitude, but there\u2019s a first time for everything.", "Probably \u201cGrandpa\u201d", "NTA. The kid is 18 right? He came to you and straight up asked for information, and you told him the truth. So long as you told him the truth, you were treating him with the respect of an adult. The truth is not always kind. That doesn\u2019t mean that we should lie.", "NTA. *His father* was present for the conversation. *His father* should have consulted his wife first, but he nevertheless chose to go through with it. In this situation, ultimate responsibility falls on *the parent who participated in revealing the truth*. \n\n*Your* wife, otoh, isn't making herself look good. She is entitled to feel aggrieved at the loss of her father, moreso bc she was a victim of the same accident. Still, I don't think that's a good enough reason for her not to have a relationship with her nephew. She's not the only one who lost a father. That she was in the accident, does not give her ownership of him. Her siblings are entitled to grieve in their own way, and, if they so choose, honor him in whatever way they see fit.\n\nIt might sound harsh, but it's the truth, and perhaps it might help your wife to realize this. Why this kid is mad at his own mother, I don't understand. I don't believe she did anything wrong. Why anyone is angry with her is beyond me, but at least the nephew can be forgiven due to his age.", "OP didn't say *tragic* or *car accident*. I feel like there must be more to \"she and her dad got in a traumatic accident\" for this to make sense", "My 31-year-old fianc\u00e9 told me his middle name was the name of his late grandfather. Earlier this year, I met my fiance's grandmother for the first time, and she was telling stories about her husband, referring to him by a completely different name. Eventually I got confused and asked - turns out my fianc\u00e9 was totally wrong and his parents just liked the name.\n\nThat said, the coma is the far more implausible aspect of the story, and the reason I think this is fiction.", "This was my thought exactly. Traumatic brain injuries are very complicated and unique to each person. It is very possible just his name triggers her trauma.", "It doesn't say OP met and married his wife in 2 years after the accident, it says the SIL had the kid \"James\" ~2 years after the accident.\n\nOP doesn't mention when they got married. They could have met/married in their 30s.", "OP did say they had previously told him a watered down version; and in the instance that led to the massive blowup the nephew was told the full truth.", "She had a traumatic brain injury. While comparing to PTSD is ok it\u2019s not the same. Every TBI impacts each person individually and uniquely", "I'm really not sure how you come out of a coma - not just a short coma, but a years long coma without some irreversible cognitive deficits due to structural changes in the brain. I'm sure OPs wife does have PTSD as well, but I don't think that this is what is really the driving force behind her behavior for this long. The cruelty is towards her, the kid is an innocent bystander who did nothing wrong, but the last thing that I'm going to do is try and hold someone to account for neuroplastic changes that have forever altered her brain due to being in a fucking coma during some seriously critical years. That's ridiculous.", "Do you also have brain damage that would maybe not allow you to face your triggers and heal in a way that a person without brain damage might? Depending on where OP's wife's brain was damaged.  \n\nI also cannot imagine naming my child a name that would trigger trauma in my sister in the first place.", "You don't know how traumas work, huh?", "Ok but lets not act like she is treating the others as kings and then spits on his name when he passes, they are just the least close, and please don't compare your trauma ro others people trauma", "Yeah, but if they weren't married, why on earth would he feel entitled to have any say in how BIL/SIL named their baby? He  includes himself among all the other people who tried to talk BIL/SIL out of this naming choice. They definitely couldn't have met/married in their 30s for him to have had anything to do with that situation at the time, which he claims he was part of attempting to prevent.", "The sister was literally in a coma due to that man and could have *never woken up*. What does it take for people to realize that a major slap in the face? \n\nFor the sister to celebrate that person\u2026. I know I would detect that as a large betrayal if my own sister didn\u2019t seem that affected to almost lose me. That hurts.", "you can\u2019t be ducking serious\u2026 no reason? after the entire family begged her not to do it and told her it wasn\u2019t a good idea?", "Yeah, the dad could have squashed the whole conversation if he didn\u2019t also think his kid deserved to know. The sister should be equally as mad at her husband.", "It' s possible that OP's wife was driving (or accidentally distracted her father when he was driving) and the others were not against the name per se, but afraid of what it could do to a person already struggling with guilt.", "PTSD is also brain damage.", "Such a weak excuse to distance herself and oddly OP\u2019s wife had the support of all the adults.

You should have never allowed this to effect your relationship this fucking badly. You btoh need to grow up. Sil deserves better than this.

Just not as much as her other nieces and nephews. (Where is the abuse here?)\n\nWhy should OP\u2019s wife put herself into situations that are unhealthy for both of them? \n\nAlso, the child is now 18, he asked why and was given the reason.

It's so sad", "I'm almost 50 and don't know my maternal grandfather's actual name. I just know people referred to him as Judge (not his name, not his job).
