I can't share everything but it ended up causing her going into a coma for a few years. She has completely (as far as she can according to the doctor) healed from the physical injuries but we are still working on the mental aspect because it is very bad.\n\nMy wife has a sister Regina(45) and a brother Calvin(47). Regina had a son 2 years after my wife woke up from a coma and decided to name him James, the name of my late FIL. All of us (me, MIL, her ILs, Calvin and her husband Will) tried to make her change the name, because we all knew it wouldn't end well. She didn't listen to us and decided to go ahead with the name.\n\nThe end result was not pretty. We now have 6 other nephews and nieces, and while my wife is very close with all of them, she isn't that close with James (he is 18 now). He has noticed this a lot and finally he asked me and Will, the real reason why my wife isn't as close with him (We gave him a watered down version). We told him the reason why and he was horrified. It ended up having a full blow up at their house, and now James is staying with my MIL.\n\nRegina is upset \"I painted her as the villain\" and after discussing what happened with my friends a lot of them think I shouldn't have told him the truth.\n\nSo I want to know AITA?\n\nForgot to add FIL had a very unique and unusual name by the standards of my country, I have yet to meet another person other than James with the same name as him.\n\nMy wife didn't treat him as a pariah, just bit more closed off to him than others. Ex: she didn't babysit him as often, she didn't take him on fun stuff alone as often (Ex he would get 1-2 a month alone while my other nephew got 2-3 times). Other than that they have an good relationships. She might not talk to him on bad days, but she does that to Calvin too because he looks so much like FIL.\n\nGods people, I'm asking if I shouldn't have told my nephew the truth. I know where my wife stands in part of the conflict so I don't need any judgements on her.\n\nThe reason my nephew was given by Regina is that my wife isn't as close to him because he was born so soon after the accident and that they didn't bond", "created_utc": 1683202398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137is8y/aita_awta_for_telling_our_nephew_why_my_wife_isnt/", "score": 1631, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That doesn't track.", "YTA. The \u201creal reason\u201d? what does that even mean? That his grandfather passed away in a tragic car accident that also hurt your wife.

If your goal was to force me to read this 3x, congratulations.\n\nWhy is naming him James a a big deal?  Is that the dead father's name?  Was this a gross-negligence accident and we hate the corpse?", "YTA.\n\nYour wife\u2019s mental health isn\u2019t her fault but is her responsibility. From your post she has been using her mental health as an excuse to irrationally exclude and punish your nephew because of his name. \n\nThis is a classic case of people tip-toeing around mental health rather than facing it properly. I can appreciate it may have been difficult after waking up from the coma and during the nephews early years when getting used to it but for this behaviour to still be happening 18 years later is absurd. Your wife is an adult punishing a child for no reason.\n\nThe entire family is giving credence to your wife\u2019s irrational thoughts which is making it all worse. And you have explained it in a way to your nephew which does make his mother out to be a villian. Apparently the sister is the only one of you capable of applying objective and rational thought. Your wife\u2019s behaviour is hers to control not her sisters.", "Am I right in understanding that your wife has treated this one nephew as a pariah because her sister named him after their late father?\n\nIf so, YTA (or more accurately,  Your wife is TA). The kid didn't get to choose his name, he at least deserved to be treated as a member of the family.\n\nI understand why your wife has a problem with the name, no doubt, and I completely see why she takes issue with her sister over it, but taking it out on the innocent party is the absolute wrong thing to do.", "YTA - Your wife is, and youre the AH for telling James this. So this child was named after his grandfather who died tragically. That seems like a lovely way to honor his memory, and something very common that people do. Why are you punishing this kid by treating him differently?\n\nEdit - clarified judgment", "I'm confused as to what your wife's sister did wrong and why her son would be mad.", "I'm so sorry to ask but what is your wife's mental state?

Stop fucking her.", "YTA if you think it's acceptable to ostracize one nephew because he was named in honor of a relative who died. Your wife needs a better therapist if she gets triggered by someone with the same name that she excludes them. You all suck for thinking that's okay for her to do and acting like Regina was wrong to honor her father.", "I don\u2019t understand. Where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s very common to name a child in honor of a deceased relative. It seems like YTA in making this a huge deal.", "INFO: can you explain more about the note about names in your culture? Also, can you explain why this seemingly beautiful tribute upsets your wife\n\nReading this my gut reaction is YTA, because people are allowed to name their children after their deceased fathers. It seems like a family name.", "INFO: he was named after his late grandfather and didn\u2019t know? Or he was told nobody wanted his mom to name him that?", "Your wife is the asshole here, by a mile.", "YTA as is your wife. Regina\u2019s father died as well. She lost her dad and watched her sister be in a coma for years, waiting for her to wake up. She got pregnant and wanted to honour her dad by naming her son after him. Your wife\u2019s mental health means she made the shitty choice to treat poor James as less than because of his name. I sympathise with someone who s clearly struggling mentally but this was a shitty thing to do. Telling James that this is all his mothers fault is both untrue and cruel, you\u2019ve damaged his relationship with his mum because your wife can\u2019t handle him having the same name as his grandfather. You could have explained that your wife is still suffering and can\u2019t always handle company but no, Regina is terrible for naming her son after her father five years after said father\u2019s death. \n\n\nYou owe Regina an apology and you owe James one too. Take responsibility for your actions- both of you. Your wife chose for more than a decade to treat James as less than- that\u2019s on her, not Regina. Now after her crappy actions she blames her sister? Assholes, both of you.", "I'm confused by the edit, too. He was born \"so soon after the accident\"? But she was in a coma for years after and he was born two years after she woke up. So how does that make any sense?\n\nAnd yes, YTA for telling your nephew this BS \"reason.\" And I don't understand what caused the problems with his mother. Because he was named after his grandfather several years after the grandfather died?", "YTA it is incredibly common to name children after a loved one who passed. And she did it years later, not right away when emotions might still be very raw. I don\u2019t understand the issue. Unless the sister actually caused her father\u2019s death this is completely normal.", "And this tragedy didn\u2019t just happen to your wife. While her situation may have been significantly more traumatic, her siblings also lost their father. Maybe it helps the sister with her grief to honor her father by naming the child after him. Seems like everyone is mad at the sister and using her child to punish her. Everyone but James sounds like an AH.", "Regina's father died as well - I'm sorry, but your wife doesn't come out looking too good in this story. I don't understand what Regina did wrong, so your attitude towards her does make you TA in my opinion.", "YTA - this was not your situation to handle. You stuck your head into the situation. Your SIL had every right to name her child after her own father\u2026 none of you had the right to even dissuade her from that bc your wife has her own struggles. Maybe suggest that your wife works in therapy bc her own choices and behaviors have caused pain and divide for everyone else bc she hasn\u2019t been able to cope. Her behaviors are not other peoples faults. The nephew shouldn\u2019t be upset more at their parent than the person who ostracized them bc they couldn\u2019t cope.", "YTA- and sadly, so is your wife. Hating a child because of his name is ridiculous.", "Yta. And this whole story is odd. I can\u2019t imagine a therapist giving their opinion on what a relative should name their child,  did he advise a notice in the local newspaper to inform everyone within a certain radius that the name James is now forbidden. Your sister in law is allowed to name her child after their deceased father. It\u2019s an extremely common way of honouring them.", "YTA and so is your wife - her sister should be able to honor her late father and it's not your poor nephew's fault what name he was given so it was very wrong of your wife to treat him any differently than the rest of her niblets.", "Maybe your wife is the assshole? Why would she losing some poor baby/kid and be hurtfully distant for a name he didn\u2019t even choose for himself?", "YTA", "YTA for explaining it as \"Your mom shouldn't have named you that\".\n\nI dont think your wife is an AH. She spends time when she can but ultimately if she can't deal with it she can't deal with it. Even with therapy and help she might never get over that guilt, and I noticed you said she's recovered as much as she can. Major accident and coma for two years? She might literally not be able to fully overcome her trauma for medical reasons. \n\nYour SIL is def not an AH because yeah, the name might affect your wife, but it's how she dealt with her fathers death, kept him alive, honored him. That's completely reasonable. Realistically how could she think your wife would still be this affected? \n\nHow you SHOULD HAVE explained it: \"Wife is distant because the accident was very traumatic, and between her emotions and medical whatever she has a really hard time coping with hearing her father's name. She is still working on it (I hope) and she might never get past it but in the end that's on her to work through or deal with and we're both sorry for any effect it has on you. She loves you, she has a hard time dealing.\" Or something on those lines. But the \"blame\" should be on your wife. Her fault might be justified but it's still hers.\n\nSide note: Is a nickname possible? Maybe something completely unrelated or not James shortened. Like \"Firstborn\" or his favorite food or something.", "ESH- I'm in the middle on whether you should've told him, but I feel like he would wonder why he was being treated as a lesser than. I do think your SIL probably shouldn't have named him that, but it is what it is. And to some, it's a way to honor a deceased loved one.\n\nHowever, your wife is 100% TA. Treating one child different over a name and another because of how they look is immature. I get where it comes from, but 18 years? She needs to get over herself and grow up. No offense, but I think your wife is trash for treating a child differently over something they can't control. Does she not think it's wrong? Have you not ever tried to check her on it? The world does not revolve around your wife's feelings.\n\nYou and your SIL- ehhhhhh\n\nYour wife: YTA 10,000%", "YTA and your wife is as well.   It is irrational for her to behave this way.  She needs to seek therapy.  No adult should take her trauma out on a child.   \n\n I also do not believe he would leave home because of the situation.  I am sure he knew he was gone and why.  I am sure his mother explained why she named him that way.  This is either fake or you are not a reliable narrator.", "YTA and so is your wife. For her to dislike her nephew strictly because he was named after his late grandfather is ludicrous. I understand she went through some things, but so did the rest of the family. Naming her first born after her late father doesn\u2019t seem out of bounds. Disliking him because of his name, absolutely is.", "You're wife is TA. Isolating James and making him feel different for his whole childhood for his name is awful.", "I mean, it is super common to name your child after one of the grandparents, especially someone you loved dearly who is no longer with you. My daughter is named after my grandmother and my son is named after my dad (still living). \n\nWhy on earth is your wife taking it out on her nephew decades later? He was named after his mother's father, very clearly someone who his mother loved and respected in life. This just doesn't make sense from you or your wife's side. YTA.", "Going with YTA. Regina lost her father in a tragic accident and wanted to honor him by giving her son his name. Very common for children to be named to honor family members. You all tried to bully her into choosing something else which I don't understand.  She didn't do this to be hurtful but that's how you all made it seem.\n\nThen your wife holds this in her heart and puts only 1 nephew at arms length until he finally says something. You step in and blame his mother for this causing a huge issue. That sir makes you the asshole.", "YTA a bit, but not for telling the truth. Not 'allowing' the kid to be named after your FIL and having the kid for that is why. His mother did nothing wrong.", "Whilst it is nice to be considerate of others it is not the duty of others to be responsible for someone else's trauma and mental health. What your wife went threw is terrible. But the SIL also lost her father and whilst your wife at the time had only been healing from it for 2 years it had been so much longer for her sister. Your wife was concentrating so much on the person she lost that she missed out on the person that was there. Whilst there's no time frame for grief when its creating barriers in personal relationships years after the fact then serious help and healing need to be done. Instead of being responsible for her mental health she blamed the sister and thats not right. YTA and your wife for letting it get to this situation and causing unnecessary hurt to a kid that did no wrong.", "NTA for telling James why there is this rift.\n\nEveryone is approaching this wrong. This all sounds complicated, but given the trauma from the accident (which I know you couldn\u2019t fully explain), the aspect of the coma, the fact that the name was unusual, and the fact that \u201cJames\u201d blew up, it seems like something bad and unfair to your wife went on with the naming.\n\nThe narrow question here is whether you two are TA for telling your nephew this family history. No.", "I don't think you are an AH.\n\nMy judgement is based on the perspective of your wife and WHY this relationship is the way it is.\n\nMy personal experience is I have a lot of mental health issues and those mental health issues can cause impulsive, erratic behavior.  You said your wife has a lot of trauma, which does have an impact on her relationships, and how she behaves around people.  I got treatment for my trauma and it helped me accept things so I could treat people better.\n\nIt sounds like your wife kept distance with him because of her own grief, but that is not fair to James.  That is a special name, one to honor and remember for your family and your family can use it, that's not the issue I see.   Names get passed down, it's a beautiful thing, but your wife treated him different for it and that's not fair to him, she has to find a way to accept this part of him and treat him like an individual he is.  Her feelings don't dictate what other people do.\n\nJames has a right to know if what he observed is true, and you told him the truth, I do not think that was wrong.\n\nJames and your wife need to repair their own relationship and I think that although her mental health might be clouding her decisions, the name causes her a lot of grief, which isn't fair to James at all, but it says to me your wife is still very much struggling and may need some other additional help and treatment.\n\nI have mental illnesses, that is my experience in life.  I know what they do to you, they destroy you, they mess with your head, your psyche.  You question everything and everything is a trigger or reminder of pain.\n\nThe responsibility falls on your wife for how she treated James, he didn't deserve that.  You told him the truth, I respect that.\n\nHis reaction is his own and he is allowed.  I think it is up to James to decide the relationship, which he has every right to do.  It's up to your wife to address her mental health and decide if she wants a relationship with him, but sometimes bonds just don't form and we can't control that.  All we can say is, how do we walk forward, what can we do to find solutions.\n\nI am sorry your wife is struggling so much.  Mental health is unpredictable and hard to understand.  Maybe in time with continued treatment, her trauma will subside and things can be better, but James is allowed to be mad and should make this decision himself.  It is up to him now.\n\nEdit: People can get better and with healing comes acceptance and in that sense the wife could find healing from her trauma and build a better relationship with him.  That's all I'm saying.", "I\u2018m going with a soft YTA. Your wife was/is traumatised and grieving, her sister was also grieving and probably wanted to honour her father. The way you phrased the explanation to your nephew does paint his mother in not so good light and I see no reason for that.", "YTA and so is your wife. \n\nNaming a child in honor of a deceased family member is not outrageous, treating a child like shit because of their name absolutely is.", "NTA for telling the truth \nBut you are an asshole for letting your wife do that.\n\nyour sail has every right to name her kid in Honor of her dead father \nI\u2019m sorry your wife has trauma \nThat is not her sisters burden to bare \nYour wife has had over a decade to get therapy instead of treating her nephew so differently that he noticed. \nIt has been years \nYou and your wife should\u2019ve gone to therapy, some anything to make that not happen \n\nEven if your mad at sil for naming him that.

Regina had a son 2 years after my wife woke up from a coma and decided to name him James, the name of my late FIL. All of us (me, MIL, her ILs, Calvin and her husband Will) tried to make her change the name, because we all knew it wouldn't end well. She didn't listen to us and decided to go ahead with the name. \n\nThe end result was not pretty. We now have 6 other nephews and nieces, and while my wife is very close with all of them, she isn't that close with James (he is 18 now). He has noticed this a lot and finally he asked me and Will, the real reason why my wife isn't as close with him (We gave him a watered down version). We told him the reason why and he was horrified. It ended up having a full blow up at their house, and now James is staying with my MIL.\n\nRegina is upset \"I painted her as the villain\" and after discussing what happened with my friends a lot of them think I shouldn't have told him the truth.\n\nSo I want to know AITA?\n\nForgot to add FIL had a very unique and unusual name by the standards of my country, I have yet to meet another person other than James with the same name as him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It wasn\u2019t. There was no reason for her to know her sister would have this very particular trauma response. \n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone is at fault.

Everyone can make up reasons but until the \"real story\" is told, I don't think anyone can make a judgment on this. \n\nI could see it being that OP's wife always wanted to name her first son after her father and she was mad her sister didn't wait longer to see if she would come out of the coma.

The obvious blame being put on the SIL makes me doubt that she wasn\u2019t painted as a villain in some way, even unintentionally, considering her sons reaction was so intense and there is obvious blame here on SIL who was doing something to help heal her own trauma and honor her father.", "Probably because OP\u2019s wife wanted to use the name for her first child and is pissed that sister used it first.

Op ruined a relationship between a mom and son to justify his wife's behavior. I think that is wrong. Again, the sister did nothing wrong there. But op flipped the blame to the sister, and should have kept it at \"my wife's issues are not caused by you, but by something that happened before you were born\n\nIf it lasted a couple years, that is one thing. 20 years...seems like she is not getting the help she needs. \n\nAnd some people like identifying as the victim. Op certainly sees his wife this way. He screwed the sister because she accepted and honored her father, and he came across as resenting her for it. And like he thinks it is fair, because the whole world should bow down to his wife's needs. \n\nWhat she needs is therapy. A 20 year rejection of an innocent kid is not normal. Nor is throwing a parent under a bus. But op and wife seem to think it is fine.", "She's an adult. It's her responsibility to get therapy and deal with her trauma.

To be treated as a second-class citizen by a family member is borderline abuse, so, yes, she emotionally abused a child for something he couldn't control.
