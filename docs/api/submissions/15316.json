Where I'm from the bridesmaids pay for their dresses, but bride pays for hair and makeup and it's socially acceptable that the dress is kind of your gift (normally the whole bridal party then splits something like a dish set or kitchen aid).

Hair, make-up, dress, shoes (if all the bridesmaids are wearing the same shoes). I know it's similar in some other countries too. \n\nI think the reasons for it is because the bridesmaids are specifically being asked to perform this duty, and they have no choice over the dresses that they will be wearing. They're assigned to them based on the bride's choice, so it doesn't feel right asking them to buy a dress that they didn't have a hand in choosing. A lot of bridesmaid don't like their dresses and would never wear them again. It's not what they would choose for themselves, but they wear what the bride wants and has chosen. All I know for certain is that it's custom where I am for the bride to pay for the bridesmaid's outfits.", "I bought all of my bridesmaids their dresses. They just bought their own shoes.

Hair and make up, yes, but not anything that the bridesmaid gets to keep.", "Oops, freaking typos, I\u2019ll fix it!", "Completely agree! If people can wear what they want, the cost is on them. If the Bride chooses the outfit, the bride pays. I don't know where other people come from but in Britain it was traditional for the bride to pay for bridesmaid dresses, whilst in the USA they make the bridesmaids pay for the honour of wearing a dress they can't even choose. Unfortunately more UK brides are cutting costs by asking their bridesmaids to pay for their own dress, which makes no sense to me. Especially because (in my experience) brides have far more expensive taste for dresses when they're not paying!", "YWNBTA. I am so shocked that she would think this is OK behaviour.", "YWNBTA - maybe the shade of green can be incorporated into your outfit somehow?

Telling guest what to wear is ridiculous and leaving it this late in the day is ridiculous as well.

Even kicking you out of her bridal party (even if you say she was \u201clovely\u201d about it) was really obnoxious, especially as you had already paid for the dress and alterations.

I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid 3 times now.  First one I didn\u2019t have to pay for my dress, but only because the bride\u2019s mom was a seamstress and made all the dresses herself, including the wedding gown.  Second was for my brothers wedding, and if I remember correctly bridesmaids were responsible for the cost of the dress, but either my brother or my parents paid for it, because I was working as a groom in the show jumping industry and only making $850 per month before taxes, lol.  Third wedding was another friend and I had to pay for my dress.  \n\nI agree that the bride SHOULD pay for the bridesmaid dresses, but it\u2019s not the norm here in Canada, not unless it\u2019s changed in the last decade or so.", "My bridesmaids paid for their dresses.

I just wanted them to be my bridesmaids. I did give them some good gifts for being in the wedding.", "I the last time I was a bridesmaid, the bride\u2019s parents split the cost of the bridesmaid dresses and the bride bought our jewelry for the day as bridesmaid gifts.

Which is why she\u2019s allowed to pick them", "Said this earlier but my ladies paid for their own (normal in the US). I did let them choose their dresses. Told them a color scheme (deep purples, burgundy, and fall shades of orange or yellow). They could choose if it was long or short, and they could choose the fabric. I just wanted them to be solid color. If they found a $5 dress at a thrift shop, great! If they wanted to spend $500 for a dress, that\u2019s their choice.

It\u2019s not wrong to gently push back and let her know that at this point finding another dress, getting it tailored in time and footing the bill for all these last minute expenses (rush delivery, rush tailoring) is unreasonable. There\u2019s totally a way to do it while reassuring her that her day will be fun, beautiful and all around wonderful. She doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s being malicious, it just sounds like she\u2019s flying out in orbit and doesn\u2019t realize her expectations are out of the norm.", "NTA.

She ended up being the one in white at my wedding, while I was wearing a pink dress.  :)  We did each others' hair and our own makeup.", "It does make more sense to do it that way IMO, but it's just not culturally the norm here. Plus if they are sisters or close friends, the bride is likely a bridesmaid in others' weddings and will in turn buy her own dress for those occasions."]}
