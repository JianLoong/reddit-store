I am very short with quite frankly have weird proportions, so finding black tie dresses that fit and look good on me can be a hassle. I needed to have this one tailored as well. I don't even have it yet. I sent a photo of this dress to her before I bought it and she approved (will still be in family photos). This was another several hundred dollars. \n\nThen yesterday she texts me and says that actually she wants the whole family to wear a specific shade of green, even the people not in the party.

Unfortunately I cannot afford a new dress since I purchased the dress you approved. If it is important to you and you would like an entirely different dress you will have to pay for it as I am already over budget.\u201d", "You most definitely WNBTA! You have already shown alot of grace for a bride who apparently constantly changes her mind (and might very well change it again) and not only that, you've had to pay hundreds of dollars to go along with her whims. That's bridezilla behavior to me - if a bride wants something that specific from her wedding guests in terms of attire, it's only fair if she pays for it herself. \nPlus, pictures will actually look better if everyone on it isn't decked from head to toe in the exact same color, but switches it up a bit like your idea of a sash.", "If she wants you in a shade of green, then she can buy a green dress for you. In fact, I'm astonished that you had to buy your own bridesmaid's dress. The bride normally buys all these dresses. I gather the bridesmaids were not initially going to be in uniform dress? I guess if you're all wearing individual dresses then I can see why you might buy it yourself. Bridesmaids usually all wear the same dress, in order to distinguish them from other guests, and show that they're part of the bridal party, and wedding ceremony.\n\nI think you've been very understanding and have incurred huge expense, and you have also lost money, due to all her last minute changes. I don't know how she could ask you to be bridesmaid, and you buy a dress, and get it tailored, only for her to renege on this offer. You were very understanding. Now after doing the same with your second dress, she's shifting the goalposts again.\n\nEither ask her to pay for a green dress, or tell her that this is the dress that you're wearing, and that's how it will remain.", "NTA.\n\nIf she wants everybody in the family to wear a specific color, she should be the one to pay for it.", "NTA. No one can expect you to spend loads of money on numerous dresses just because the bride is changing her mind about them constantly", "NTA. I hate this trend of making people in wedding parties buy their own dresses. I would say you already bought a dress and will change the sash but that is it.", "NTA. She should let you wear the black dress or pay for your green dress (if she doesn\u2019t agree to the sash compromise) since you already ran it by her and she already approved it. And even though she said \u201cThis is the last change I promise\u201d what if it isn\u2019t? Not to mention that she agreed that she\u2019s being annoying.", " NTA, your sis in law is being indecisive and not very flexible, dresses are a lot of $, if she\u2019s going to change her mind so often she should help pay", "NTA and don't buy another dress. The sash idea is a good one but if she doesn't like it, she needs to let it go. Weddings aren't dress up doll time. She's going to change her mind again.", "Nta, but if you don\u2019t comply is she going to get upset? Is it worth the hassle?", "NTA, if she wants such a specific dress code, she should cover all costs. You paying for the first dress was generous enough.

Where I'm from the bridesmaids pay for their dresses, but bride pays for hair and makeup and it's socially acceptable that the dress is kind of your gift (normally the whole bridal party then splits something like a dish set or kitchen aid). But then again all the weddings I've been too/in have been in parks, backyards, churches and even a dive bar, so a \"fancy\" wedding is new territory (people in my town are calling this the tomato wedding, like a joke about royal hillbilly tomatoes lol). \n\nBut no the original dresses were all the same, we originally went to Atlanta to get a dress from a designer for her and but then when we were there she saw bridesmaid dresses she fell in love with and the shop lady said to get them early because they were selling a lot of them.", ">The bride normally buys all these dresses.\n\nNot necessarily, where I am from, bridesmaids pay for their own dresses.  For my wedding, I offered, but my two bridesmaids said they will pay for them.  I then opted for them to choose their own shoes to save on costs.", "Yep there\u2019s no way I would be purchasing another dress and op should have told mini bridezilla that when she contacted her.", "Do you mean YWNBTA?", "Where I am, the bride pays for everything. Hair, make-up, dress, shoes (if all the bridesmaids are wearing the same shoes). I know it's similar in some other countries too. \n\nI think the reasons for it is because the bridesmaids are specifically being asked to perform this duty, and they have no choice over the dresses that they will be wearing. They're assigned to them based on the bride's choice, so it doesn't feel right asking them to buy a dress that they didn't have a hand in choosing. A lot of bridesmaid don't like their dresses and would never wear them again. It's not what they would choose for themselves, but they wear what the bride wants and has chosen. All I know for certain is that it's custom where I am for the bride to pay for the bridesmaid's outfits.", "I bought all of my bridesmaids their dresses. They just bought their own shoes. I paid for their hair and makeup too.", "Even if buying bridesmaids dresses are the norm for each bridesmaid, she kicked you out of the bridal party. Etiquette would dictate she pay you back for the dress & alteration expenses since it was her decision that caused you to not need that dress.", "Same. I don\u2019t know any brides that paid for the bridesmaid dress or shoes.  Hair and make up, yes, but not anything that the bridesmaid gets to keep.", "Oops, freaking typos, I\u2019ll fix it!", "Completely agree! If people can wear what they want, the cost is on them. If the Bride chooses the outfit, the bride pays. I don't know where other people come from but in Britain it was traditional for the bride to pay for bridesmaid dresses, whilst in the USA they make the bridesmaids pay for the honour of wearing a dress they can't even choose. Unfortunately more UK brides are cutting costs by asking their bridesmaids to pay for their own dress, which makes no sense to me. Especially because (in my experience) brides have far more expensive taste for dresses when they're not paying!"]}
