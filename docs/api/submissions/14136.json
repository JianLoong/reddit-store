At 23 you broke up with your boyfriend and your parents spent your wedding fund on a beach house.  They do not owe you a wedding but as they paid for three for your brother there is a big issue with them.  Hold the wedding you can afford.  If you are so inclined invite them as guest but do not list them on the invitation or give them any roll.  (no walking down the aisle, daddy daughter dance).  Most of all they are not allowed to invite any of their friends.  Most of all go low to no contact.

You are NTA.", "I understand why you're hurt and they're bogus for their actions but they don't owe you a wedding fund. If you want a fund you save for it.", "Luckily, you also aren't obligated to invite them to your wedding.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I'm sorry.  I totally get this.  When one of my sisters was 18 she was getting married a few months from her engagement.  Her fiance's family had more money than ours and offered to help.  My dad would go on and on ranting to me about how he wished she would just wait a year because he could save and give her this amazing wedding and how he felt bad that he couldn't contribute more than some food and her veil.  \n\nFast forward a couple years and I'm getting married.  About a year from engagement to wedding date.  I immediately talked to my dad and asked him if he thought he could help with this venue I found.  By wedding standards it was super cheap and included clean up, decor, a catering discount %, dj and a bunch of other stuff (smaller town areas, it was about 2.5k, much less than what he was saying he wanted to do for her wedding).  I didn't want him to even pay the whole thing, I just wanted to know if he could help, and if so how much he thought he could.  He said it'd be too expensive and that he could let me know the week before the wedding if I needed help still.  Maybe he could get some more food for us if we didn't have it catered.  It really hurt because to me it felt like a slap in the face.  3 kids out of the house now, more money than he'd had years before, and the time he'd said he'd need to do an extravagant wedding.  It made me feel like I was less of his kid or less important.  Not even a veil or guaranteed food help.  (Her veil was like $800, I've no idea how much the food was that he helped with but he made it seem like a lot).\n\nIt was fine.  We ended up doing a VFW hall for super cheap, some family and ourselves made most of the food.  I made my wedding cake, an aunt made cupcakes too (she's an amazing baker and used to cater events for friends).  My best friend's mom bought my dress for me ($100).  We did a court house ceremony and then a reception at the V.  Was it my dream?  No.  But it was doable without debt, it was fun, we were surrounded by people that really cared, and I knew officially where I stood with which family members.  Plus my uncle's potato salad is literally the best thing in the world and no catering could have topped that for me.   \n\nCongrats on your engagement, and please don't let this ruin it for you.  You're getting married for hopefully life! That's the part to focus on.

He even got a cash app so he could send me money quickly if I need it. When my wife came out as trans she also ended up going NC with her family too because it became very clear where she stood in their lives. Her sisters and mom got a party at every graduation. She was the first to go to college in her fam and the first and ONLY to get a BA. Her graduation party was actually her mom's graduation party. I was the only person who was there that was there for my wife, everyone else that got invited was for my wife's mom. Everything g there was for her mom. All gifts were for her mom. All the memorabilia from the event was made for her mom. All the well wishes were for her mom. Her sisters got parties for graduating 8th grade ffs.

A fund sitting around gathering dust without a target payout date isn't doing anyone any good. \n\nYour parents HAVE proven willing to take the initiative and pay for both of their children's weddings, including yours. \n\nI feel like you jumped to a conclusion out of jealousy for your brother and I think you shot yourself in the foot when you perceived unfair treatment: Instead of talking about whether or not they're planning on paying, you took your lack of knowledge about their plans as them favoring your brother and accused them of not caring about your future. That would be out of line. You clearly aren't close to the details of how your parents plan their funds for things if you had no idea that they used the previous moneys for something else. I find no reason to think they weren't planning on paying for your wedding.
