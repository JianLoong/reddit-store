When one of my sisters was 18 she was getting married a few months from her engagement.  Her fiance's family had more money than ours and offered to help.  My dad would go on and on ranting to me about how he wished she would just wait a year because he could save and give her this amazing wedding and how he felt bad that he couldn't contribute more than some food and her veil.  \n\nFast forward a couple years and I'm getting married.  About a year from engagement to wedding date.  I immediately talked to my dad and asked him if he thought he could help with this venue I found.  By wedding standards it was super cheap and included clean up, decor, a catering discount %, dj and a bunch of other stuff (smaller town areas, it was about 2.5k, much less than what he was saying he wanted to do for her wedding).  I didn't want him to even pay the whole thing, I just wanted to know if he could help, and if so how much he thought he could.  He said it'd be too expensive and that he could let me know the week before the wedding if I needed help still.  Maybe he could get some more food for us if we didn't have it catered.  It really hurt because to me it felt like a slap in the face.  3 kids out of the house now, more money than he'd had years before, and the time he'd said he'd need to do an extravagant wedding.  It made me feel like I was less of his kid or less important.  Not even a veil or guaranteed food help.  (Her veil was like $800, I've no idea how much the food was that he helped with but he made it seem like a lot).\n\nIt was fine.  We ended up doing a VFW hall for super cheap, some family and ourselves made most of the food.  I made my wedding cake, an aunt made cupcakes too (she's an amazing baker and used to cater events for friends).  My best friend's mom bought my dress for me ($100).  We did a court house ceremony and then a reception at the V.  Was it my dream?  No.  But it was doable without debt, it was fun, we were surrounded by people that really cared, and I knew officially where I stood with which family members.  Plus my uncle's potato salad is literally the best thing in the world and no catering could have topped that for me.   \n\nCongrats on your engagement, and please don't let this ruin it for you.  You're getting married for hopefully life! That's the part to focus on.  Your day will be beautiful no matter what because of that, not because of flower arrangements :)", "NTA I\u2019m wondering if there is a cultural component of preferring boys over girls?

Obviously like others have said no one owes you a wedding fund, but it's completely understandable to feel hurt in this situation and in no way makes you an AH.
