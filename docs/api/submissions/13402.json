There are large communal tables for this night and they assign seats at the tables for your party, elbow to elbow. The entire restaurant fills their reservations within 15 minutes the morning after a dinner for the next month\u2019s dinner, so it\u2019s kind of a big deal if you happen to snag some.  Kind of like calling in a radio station and if you get through, people will reserve the block for their entire party\u2014some parties are up to 20 people.\n\nI told two friends that are a couple about this and asked if they wanted to join for the next month\u2019s dinner.  If so, I\u2019d put the reservation in to account for them.  I managed to snag the RSVPs and let them know.  We were excited and talked about it throughout the month.\n\nFlash forward to 2.5 hours before the dinner I get a text at work asking if they were expected to pay for their food. I told them it was prix fixe at $60/person (plus tip/cocktails).  Not a cheap dinner, but totally manageable with our incomes and especially with a month\u2019s notice.  I was informed that they did not know they had to pay for dinner and that it wasn\u2019t in their budget because they had spent a lot of money on other things recently.  It wasn\u2019t expressly implied that I pay for them, just that they weren\u2019t aware they had to pay.  I simply replied, \u201cmaybe we should have had this conversation a month, or even a week ago.\u201d\n\nI struggled to fill their spots last minute, but wasn\u2019t able to.  Luckily, the restaurant said I wasn\u2019t on the hook to pay for the seats that would unfortunately go to waste.  If I was, I would have just paid for my friends to come, even though it was an expense I myself hadn\u2019t prepared for.\n\nSo, long story short, AITA for not offering to pay for this couple for dinner?", "created_utc": 1680000766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124ksrl/aita_for_not_paying_for_dinner/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The couple were quite entitled to think that you would pay for them and as stated, if they really were not sure they should have asked the question long before the time. \n\nI think they were putting you on the spot last minute, thinking that if they said they were broke and could not afford it so close to the time, you would offer to foot the bill.

Life tip, don't invite them on a cruise or anything", "NTA; they should have asked about the price when you first brought up the event.", "NTA. You are all in the same boat financially where you need to save for special things, why would they expect that of you? I know some people will say if you ask them to come, you should pay . You did not ask them on a date and even the rules in dates are not so far and fast. What if you brought up the dinner to 6 couples? Do they think you owe the dozen a dinner for explaining the dinner opportunity and being willing to try for reservations. I will never offer for make brunch plans for the group again. No real friends would try and run this scam on you if you are not a Hilton.", "NTA. I find this bizarre why if you\u2019ve been asked to go out to eat for dinner why would you expect the person who invited you to pay? Then it only occurs to them to ask 2.5 hours before and claim they weren\u2019t aware they had to pay? Yeah they\u2019re weird.", "NTA but should have been brought up by one of you if there were any questions or confusion about it.", "Info: how close are you as friends?", "NAH\n\nI feel like this was just a lack of communication. I feel like you should have given them the price when asking if they wanted to join. $60 for dinner, no cocktails, per person is quite expensive, and that price should be told to everyone when inviting them.\n\nNo mention of the cost of the restaurant, and being invited out, I guess I can get why they would think this might be paid for. Still, this being friends rather than a date or something, I think they should have been prepared for the strong likelihood they were paying for their own dinners. This isn\u2019t a specific event you\u2019re throwing, after all. But I can sort of understand the confusion. It isn\u2019t uncommon for a group of friends to take turns paying for the table, but I don\u2019t know what your dynamic with the couple is.\n\nBut as far as the actual question goes, NTA for not offering to pay, but I do think you should have said this set cost when making the plans. They would have known what to expect, and had been able to accept or decline the info. For a lot of decent restaurants, $60 would cover two people, minus drinks. So I even get accepting with the understanding of paying for yourself, finding out how much this place really costs, then backing out. Many have a budget set aside monthly for fun spending money, and this could easily take a huge chunk out of those funds that just aren\u2019t doable.\n\nBut they also should have asked for more details about this place and expectations.", "NTA unless someone specifically says something along the lines of \"My treat\" or \"On me\", its a bit entitled to assume someone is going to pay for you.\n\nDoesn't matter if you have a history of paying for them, you didn't say you were going to pay.", "Think it is hugely entitled on their part to assume you would be paying for their dinner. Very odd. NTA", "NTA. I guess maybe it should have been clarified before but it was a weird assumption on their part", "Maybe im weird but im pretty sure the only time its ever even remotely implied that youre paying when you ask people to dinner is when youre very clearly asking for a date-and even thats somewhat hazy. NTA", "NTA, it's always nice when someone invites you to dinner and pays but it's not the expectation. If they were worried about money they should have talked about this with you well before hand", "NTA\n\nUnless you're a group that regularly treats each other, you never assume and it's obnoxious that they would. Lesson learned.\n\nThat said, if you trust them overall, I would have offered to cover if they paid me back. Then if they really are just accidentally short but not entitled, they'd prob accept.", "NTA If friends asked me out to dinner I would never assume they were paying .", "NTA. You handled the misunderstanding as well as you could have and don\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship or relationship with restaurant so that\u2019s great. \n\nYour only error was not communicating the cost in the first place but I think you\u2019ve already realized that. Life lesson for next time. \n\nHow was the dinner?", "lacking context here. in my culture for the older generation, if you ask someone to join you for dinner, it can be expected that the one inviting is going to pay for the meal since they asked them to come.", "NTA \n\nBut this is a breakdown in communication and basic manners. Historically and in proper etiquette, when one invites people to join them in a social event, they are offering to pay unless explicitly stated otherwise. Its why, when you receive an invitation to a party or event, you don't pay to attend unless the invite states a cover charge or admission fee. And if you are part of their bridal party and invite them out, one would naturally draw the conclusion it is a social invite and possibly celebratory. Obviously, at some point, they caught wind you were not on the same page and called to verify. Now you made comment about their finances and what they can afford. Stop that, you don't know their financial situation, so its not your place to speculate or decide what they can afford, and that comes off as snobbish and classless. Never assume you know someone's financial situation just because you think you know their income level. Now them waiting to the last minute, AH behavior.", "NTA. They are classless and socially crude, expecting someone else to pay their fare.\n$60 is incredibly cheap, too. That\u2019s what? $120 for meal, $80 for wine, $30 for HST, and $36 for tip. Under $300 - for two!\nA typical dinner date normally runs $1,000. Any price fix under $350/person is a bargain", "Nta.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
