{"id": 14747, "submission_id": "12l1ie2", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend's kids to treat me like a roommate not a stepmom?", "selftext": "I have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years and moved in 4 months ago. He has 6 kids. He has 2 adult sons, a 17 y.o son, 15 y.o daughter, 14 y.o son, and 7 y.o son. He has custody of his youngest son 2 days during the week and every other weekend. The teenage kids no longer follow any custody agreement and split time between parents how they choose.\n\nI would say I have a fairly good relationship with his kids, and I actually enjoy spending time with them. \n\nOne of the things that annoys me is they often eat food I specifically brought for myself, so when I go and grab a snack there's nothing to eat. This happens frequently and even when I tell them something is for me, they eat it. My boyfriend's daughter regularly uses the master bathroom as it's the only one with a bath, but she never cleans up after herself and uses my products and when I mention it, she just shrugs me off. \n\nA couple nights ago my boyfriend was out of town and the 3 teens still spent the night at his place. I kept to myself and let them do their own thing. I made myself some dinner and when I was almost done two of the kids and one of their friends came into the kitchen. The daughter asked why I hadn't asked them if they wanted anything, and I replied that they know how to sort themselves out and I'm not their chef. She ended up making dinner for her brothers and her friend. Afterwards she told me she had washed up from their dinner and had left mine. I told her that was fine and that I wouldn't expect her too. She went on to again comment on me not asking about what everybody else was doing for dinner. I again told her that wasn't my business. I elaborated with her and told her I wasn't looking to be her stepmom and that she should treat me like a roommate. That means respecting my space, belongings, and privacy, as well as not expecting me to cook/clean for her, but also know that I won't make her do chores for me. I brought up them eating my food, using my bathroom and products. I made it clear it goes both ways and that we can have a good relationship if the expectation of the relationship isn't a mother/daughter dynamic.\n\nAt some point she told her dad what I said. When he confronted me, I told him that's how I feel and that I thought we were on the same page about his kids. He claimed that him not wanting me to parent his kids is different to me treating them like a roommate. He points out his kids cook for themselves and for the family all the time and help each other with things they need (eg oldest giving rides, babysitting, reading/playing with the youngest). He thinks this makes it seem like I don't want to be part of his family at all. I told him that isn't true as I have a enjoy my time with his kids but that doesn't mean I want to end up in a position where I'm their maid. I'm also not against the nature of my relationship with his kids changing as our relationship continues.

Either you're their stepmom with all the duties and privileges that being a stepmom entails, or you're just a roommate, in which case you're not obligated to discipline or even care for them.

I assume you are probably willing to help him when needed, but he is likely only there when his dad is so it's still not really your problem.\n\nThe rest of the kids are old enough that your responsibility is pretty much limited to:\n\n1. They manage to eat something.  If they communicate that they would like you to HELP them make a certain meal, then I would encourage you to do so.  Otherwise, all you have to do is make sure there are appropriate teen cookable food options available to them.  If you aren't in the habit of cooking them food, and they did not ask if you would, then they should not expect it.  I am sure they know where the pizza rolls are in the freezer.\n\nAnd \n\n2. Making sure they don't do anything dangerous/illegal and making sure they get out alive if there is an emergency.\n\n\n\nAs for the snacks and bath products, my roommates never left that shit alone either.

Leaving a 14, 15 and 17 and not having any plans for meals, rides and emergencies has me confused. Does he normally let these kids just take care of theme when he's out of town? Some communication needs to happen. Did they think you were the adult in charge? Did he tell them that? Are they allowed to have friends over when he's out of town? It's the parents job to set the expectations.

Family doesn't mean you don't have personal belongings, sharing a living space doesn't mean you can't have personal belongings. My cousin has an entire drawer in the fridge he's taken over with stuff he buys for himself that no one else gets into without permission.", "NTA I think this is smart. You can be expected to do all the things a mother does with none of the authority. The authority part is over rated. The daughter expected you to cook for them and then ratted you out.

Ask him to define it for you.  \nYou sound reasonable to me, so long as you aren't expecting the 7 year old to cook for himself alone.  \n\nEta: So stupid, i know, but now all i can think of is being a kid and one sister was \"i know you are, but what am i\" -ing the little brother, and he howls \"WHAT ARE YOU!?!\" Lmao", "NTA...you respect them as individuals and treat them as such.

If that's the case tou really have no right to then have a problem with his daughter using the bath, she has likely always done it and youre the new person here.\n\nThe food stuff is also hard to tell who is in the wrong.

It sounds to me like these are differences in defining the phrase \"part of a household\", as opposed to a hard-line between step-parent and non step-parent.

Might feel silly but it\u2019ll put emphasis on how often they\u2019re taking your stuff", "But the BF does not want her to be raising them: He claimed that him not wanting me to parent his kids is different to me treating them like a roommate.\u201d", ">He claimed that him not wanting me to parent his kids is different to me treating them like a roommate.\n\nI mean he wanted Op to **not parent** the kids, but he still expects her to cook, clean and be a general parent for his children. \n\nOP shows she likes children and they seem to have a good enough relationship to have such honest and open conversations as the one being shown in the post, so i don't see how OP is showing any signs that she isn't a family type of person. \n\nShe literally respects the kids boundaries and treats the teenagers like they should be treated and doesn't undermine them, or forces them to obey her authority as a maybe some day step mother/the only adult in the house.", "Apologies you're absolutely right, I only saw the 4 children who are below 18.", "Yeah me too, tbh I\u2019d offer my roommate too never mind if they were a child or not lol. I\u2019m assuming from this post that his children lived in this home/ family setting for a while. Having a new adult suddenly living there and expecting to be treated like a roommate is such a weird dynamic and something that would take getting used to for them all.", "She's treating them worse than a friend who is a roommate would in my opinion.", "I didn't say she did anything wrong. The person who I responded to said something about them treating her like family. I'm simply pointing out that they (the children) do.", "I thought I had.", "Right, the role of a stepparent is to parent. I mean it is in the title. The dad doesn't want her to parent them, just take care of them by cooking, cleaning, and allow them to disrespect her. She didn't have a problem with them staying, even though their dad was not there. I wonder how do they treat their mom.", "No apology necessary I just find that 6 is more of a shock than 4 lol\n\nOP is very obviously dating a family man\u2026 or someone who wanted to be one and it didn\u2019t exactly work out. They have very different attitudes about kids so I wonder how they ended up together", "It sounds like the misconception is the difference of being the parent and being part of the household. They function as a unit. It sounds like when one person makes dinner, they make dinner for everyone. They pitch in when needed and all work together to make sure everyone\u2019s needs are met. Food, products, and spaces have likely always been shared. You seem to want to coexist without fully becoming part of that unit.  I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to jump in with both feet, but if your not willing or able to adapt, it may not be the living situation for you. \n\nTo your question I say a soft YTA. I think she was put off you didn\u2019t include them in dinner because that\u2019s what they do, and you basically said \u201cI\u2019ll stay  out of your way if you stay out of mine\u201d. That\u2019s not how they function and was probably hurtful to her.", "Yeah that's not your fault, it's your partners. You need to all sit down and talk about the dynamics of your relationships cause this miscommunication can't happen again otherwise the kids will see you as a lazy room-mate", "Couples can live separately, you know.\n\nIt seems pretty bizarre to tell kids who have never lived on their own to \u201ctreat you like a roommate.\u201d They\u2019ve never had roommates before, they are accustomed to being a part of a family unit where everything is shared. You shouldn\u2019t have moved in if you weren\u2019t prepared to be a part of that unit. The only thing they probably internalized from your conversation is that you don\u2019t see them as family.", "YTA, the kid is right, it was a dick move.", "YTA (kinda), but also woefully ignorant and setting yourself up for a bad time... A lot of people have mentioned it already, but who on earth would get into a serious relationship with a man that has six kids and not fully expect this dynamic? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of weird stuff in this post, but whether you like it or not, being a step parent (which is exactly what you signed up for when you moved in) means you do all of the parenting stuff without the authority to discipline. You aren\u2019t just granted authority over these kids bc you are sleeping with their father. You are ultimately the outsider here and if you want this relationship to work, you need to get comfortable with how the kids live within this space. That means other people are going to eat the snacks that you put in the kitchen, use the products you put in the bathroom, etc. If those are things you want for yourself, make sure you have enough for everyone. \n\nTo the people who say \u201cthe roommate analogy is great, that\u2019s a good boundary to set!\u201d \u2026 the only roommates a 17 year old child have ever known are their parents and siblings. They have no idea what it means to be a good roommate. It would be silly of you to expect that kind of dynamic from them bc they have literally no context, and unless you want them to hate you, you should not be setting roommate-style boundaries with children. \n\nSorry for the rant, I am speaking as someone whose dad\u2019s girlfriend moved in with him when I was 14 and still hate her 20 years later. It just blows my mind that she couldn\u2019t stand to be more generous with us for the Wednesday afternoons and every other weekend that my sister and I spent at his house.", "Nah, I'd be more comfortable nailing my roommate than my step-mother.", "Also sacrifice all her belongings (food, hygiene products) for them", "Except it is exactly how being a _good_ step parent works. Banging someone\u2019s dad doesn\u2019t give you license to raise them.", "no, they're treating her as a roommate they can take full advantage of without any consequences. \n\ni mean, eating snacks she *explicitly* said she bought for herself? using her products she *explicitly* forbade them from using? that's a shitty way to treat your mom.", "Why do you need control over them to be a decent human being to them?", "No but them cohabitating gives her the right to have her boundaries respected & they haven't done that either.", "But does that mean you have to clean up after them?", "NTA. You are NOT the wife of the father of these children. That is a totally different dynamic than a \"Step Mom\" who is married to the parent. \n\nYou are right to state your boundaries and how you choose to relate to his children. The father says \"you don't seem to want to part of this family\". That is incorrect. You don't state your or your BF age, but these children are well into the age that they can understand respect for other's private property and privacy. \n\nYou are NOT the bangmaid. And you are within your rights to have your bathroom private and your items not used or touched without your permission.\n\nYou may want to have a couple very long \"thinks\" about your position in this situation and whether this configuration of family and your BF statements are how you want to spend the next few months, years, etc. This is a sample of what you can expect.", "NTA. Set your boundaries and keep them. You're new to living with them and they are already showing a lack of respect for your space and items. I hope your influence will teach them how to respect others and communicate better. You were not disrespectful when speaking with the teen and it probably surprised them that you were so straight forward.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing the right thing. You are setting boundaries and communicating them gently and well with the children. \n\nYou will probably need to revisit the conversation with your boyfriend as he appears to have selectively listened. Restate your boundaries, and maybe include the kids in a group conversation to make sure everyone understands and clear up any questions.", "NTAH sounds perfectly reasonable.  Set the boundary early.  let them know what to expect and what you expect of them.  This is an ideal situation for grown kids and teens the youngest seven year old may need some extra parenting but it sounds reasonable to me as someone who has grown up with a bunch of step parents and I am now currently a step parent.", "NTA, but there's perhaps a better way to approach the conversation/terminology.\n\nIt sounds like although he doesn't want you to *parent* his kids, he does want you to be a role model for them, which is the thing in the space between parent and roommate.\n\nSounds like for the most part, his kids are old enough to have a fairly adult relationship with you. I swapped between parents houses as a teen/young adult at my will, and it worked because we were respectful of each other, mum & her partner would generally include me in meals as we enjoyed spending that time together, I would clean up, or vice versa. If I wasn't there at meal times maybe I'd sort myself out and maybe there'd be leftovers for me (Dad has some issues so that was a somewhat different scenario). The point being it can work when everyone pulls their weight.\n\nThat sounds like the kind of relationship you're aiming for, but remember they're not fully adults yet so they will need some guidance on it.\n\nAlso sounds like they may have taken it in a different tone than intended, i.e. they may be feeling like you don't care for them, which is a different thing entirely (I hope).\n\nObviously the younger one is a slightly different situation, but as he's there specific times I assume bf is there at those times so it's less of an issue? being a role model likely still applies though.", "YTA These are kids and you are an adult living in there home as their father\u2019s partner. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect kids to see you as a \u201croommate \u201c when they are living in the family home. There are not roommates at home. There is family. You shouldn\u2019t have moved in in this Is what you expect.  Move out.", "ESH. The conflict is coming from your understandings of what it means to be a family and what it means to be a parent. Some people think families do things for each other. You seem to be afraid that doing anything for them will make you their parent, and they feel doing things for each other makes you family. \n\nYou chose to draw a hard line instead of fostering more give and take. That\u2019s fine, but it should have been a discussion BEFORE you moved in, and bare minimum you should have offered them dinner if you were making it for yourself and THEN had a conversation with your partner talking about expectations going forward. \n\nYour lack of communication beforehand plus immediate hard line has made this very awkward when it could have been much smoother.", "EHS, but you\u2019re the adult in the situation. I\u2019d probably start looking for a new place to live. He ain\u2019t choosing you over those kids lol", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI think your solution is on point.", "Info: What reason do you have to want them to treat you as a room mate, this sounds like you are reaaaaally young. I cant imagine anyone with a teenage kid wanting any other kid to be their \"roommate\".", "NAH, seems like a miscommunication like you meant it as a simple factual statement & he took it as distancing yourself from the kids or something. \n\ndrawing reasonable boundaries & explaining them to the kids is perfectly appropriate.", "I think your boundaries are being broken and your partner is not speaking up for you.\n\nMy bf has lived with me for a year and he has a similar situation with my 15 yo. The 15 yo frequently encroached on bfs space, ate his snacks and so on.\n\nWe\u2019ve had multiple conversations and I think it\u2019s finally sticking.\n\nIn the last one I explained to my son that my bf doesn\u2019t owe him unconditional love\u2026 and he\u2019s got to have a relationship with him with respect to get that. Yes, they are essentially roommates.", "From my experience, a lot of men do that. That was certainly my experience as a step parent, anyway.", "And he isn't even at home when most of this stuff happens. So it sounds like bf was looking for a maid? 6 freaking kids, tells the OP he doesn't want her to parent them, but he is nowhere to do it either and complains when she follows his advice.", "The 7 year old wasn\u2019t there (and if he needs parenting, he does have two parents for that).", "Yeah, and all of them include OP when they are making dinner too.  Quid pro quo.  Whether OP likes it or not, she is part of their family unit.  She lives with their dad, the kids see that as their home too (which it is).  OP moved in 4 months ago and wants to change the dynamics of the home.  No one asked her to parent the kids, but she should have known that she would have to slot in with how the family dynamics worked in her boyfriend's home.  One for all and all for one and all that sort of stuff.  If OP can't deal with that then she can move out and get herself proper roomates.  \n\nAnd I agree, if I'm cooking I'm cooking for everyone, not just myself.", "Then it doesn't give you the obligation to care for them like a parent either. You can't have it both ways. Pick a lane.", "Nowhere have they said they need control over them\n\n\nStop making things up in your head and turning them into facts in there then verbalising/writing stuff based on your *thoughts from your mind*.\n\nFacts please.  They are more valid, always, than fiction.", ">OP moved in 4 months ago and wants to change the dynamics of the home.\n\nANYONE else moving into a home with others always changes the dynamic in itself...?   Are you suggesting it doesn't? \n\n>No one asked her to parent the kids, but she should have known that she would have to slot in with how the family dynamics worked in her boyfriend's home.\n\nHer and her partner had a discussion about it all before OP moved in, and OP believed her partner and accepted the terms laid out - she wasn't to parent etc.   She thought everything was discussed and agreed prior to moving in.\n\nWhy are you making out she \"should have known\" she'd need to do XYZ that wasn't part of the agreed plan?!  That's wild imo.  Why are you letting her partner - the kids actual father - off scott free?  As this is how your post comes across.\n\nHas the dad done nothing wrong here in your eyes?\n\nIs him not articulating things, and discussing the whole situation fully and in enough depth that they both understood the boundaries and expectations of them all cohabiting together? \n\nIs it all on OP?\n\n>And I agree, if I'm cooking I'm cooking for everyone, not just myself.\n\nAnd? So what?  You do you.  \n\nWhat does it have to do with OPs story?  Or are you insinuating that because you and others would do this, that it's something *everyone should*? As that's how you're coming across with those word choices.", "Bloody hell, who pissed on your cornflakes?  Where has all your aggression for an Internet stranger giving an opinion on a sub where the whole basis is opinions come from?  \n\n1.  Yes, OP believed her partner accepted the terms *she* laid out for her to move into *his* family home.  \n\n2.  Making dinner for others is NOT parenting.  Cleaning up is NOT parenting.  It is a team effort.  The kids muck in to this team effort, but OP doesn't want to.  \n\n3.  Plans and agreements trump manners and decency?  Really?  If it's not written down and signed in triplicate does that mean she doesn't have to do it?  Life doesn't work like that you know.  Life skills are not defined by agreements, you do what you have to do because it needs done.  That's adulting, that's teamwork.  And I should think OP's boyfriend didn't think he'd need to explain to his grown up girlfriend how to be a decent human being.  \n\n4.  I was agreeing with the post I was replying to.  That redditor said they would have cooked for everyone because that's how they were raised, and I agreed that I would have cooked for everyone too.  The inference that everyone should is your's and your's alone.", "No, he appropriately wants her to engage with the family dynamics.  Their food is shared, their toiletries are shared, their bathroom is shared.  They are in their dad's house, which is also their home in the same way their mum's house is home.\n\nOP wants to change that dynamic to suit herself after 4 months.  She knew what she was moving in to, but instead of realising that as the new person in this family she would have to fit in with them, she is pissed that they don't act like she wants them to.  It was their home first, and if OP doesn't like that she doesn't have to stay."]}
