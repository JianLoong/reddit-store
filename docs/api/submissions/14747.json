{"id": 14747, "submission_id": "12l1ie2", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend's kids to treat me like a roommate not a stepmom?", "selftext": "I have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years and moved in 4 months ago. He has 6 kids. He has 2 adult sons, a 17 y.o son, 15 y.o daughter, 14 y.o son, and 7 y.o son. He has custody of his youngest son 2 days during the week and every other weekend. The teenage kids no longer follow any custody agreement and split time between parents how they choose.\n\nI would say I have a fairly good relationship with his kids, and I actually enjoy spending time with them. \n\nOne of the things that annoys me is they often eat food I specifically brought for myself, so when I go and grab a snack there's nothing to eat. This happens frequently and even when I tell them something is for me, they eat it. My boyfriend's daughter regularly uses the master bathroom as it's the only one with a bath, but she never cleans up after herself and uses my products and when I mention it, she just shrugs me off. \n\nA couple nights ago my boyfriend was out of town and the 3 teens still spent the night at his place. I kept to myself and let them do their own thing. I made myself some dinner and when I was almost done two of the kids and one of their friends came into the kitchen. The daughter asked why I hadn't asked them if they wanted anything, and I replied that they know how to sort themselves out and I'm not their chef. She ended up making dinner for her brothers and her friend. Afterwards she told me she had washed up from their dinner and had left mine. I told her that was fine and that I wouldn't expect her too. She went on to again comment on me not asking about what everybody else was doing for dinner. I again told her that wasn't my business. I elaborated with her and told her I wasn't looking to be her stepmom and that she should treat me like a roommate. That means respecting my space, belongings, and privacy, as well as not expecting me to cook/clean for her, but also know that I won't make her do chores for me. I brought up them eating my food, using my bathroom and products. I made it clear it goes both ways and that we can have a good relationship if the expectation of the relationship isn't a mother/daughter dynamic.\n\nAt some point she told her dad what I said. When he confronted me, I told him that's how I feel and that I thought we were on the same page about his kids. He claimed that him not wanting me to parent his kids is different to me treating them like a roommate. He points out his kids cook for themselves and for the family all the time and help each other with things they need (eg oldest giving rides, babysitting, reading/playing with the youngest). He thinks this makes it seem like I don't want to be part of his family at all. I told him that isn't true as I have a enjoy my time with his kids but that doesn't mean I want to end up in a position where I'm their maid. I'm also not against the nature of my relationship with his kids changing as our relationship continues.

Either you're their stepmom with all the duties and privileges that being a stepmom entails, or you're just a roommate, in which case you're not obligated to discipline or even care for them.

I assume you are probably willing to help him when needed, but he is likely only there when his dad is so it's still not really your problem.\n\nThe rest of the kids are old enough that your responsibility is pretty much limited to:\n\n1. They manage to eat something.  If they communicate that they would like you to HELP them make a certain meal, then I would encourage you to do so.  Otherwise, all you have to do is make sure there are appropriate teen cookable food options available to them.  If you aren't in the habit of cooking them food, and they did not ask if you would, then they should not expect it.  I am sure they know where the pizza rolls are in the freezer.\n\nAnd \n\n2. Making sure they don't do anything dangerous/illegal and making sure they get out alive if there is an emergency.\n\n\n\nAs for the snacks and bath products, my roommates never left that shit alone either.

Leaving a 14, 15 and 17 and not having any plans for meals, rides and emergencies has me confused. Does he normally let these kids just take care of theme when he's out of town? Some communication needs to happen. Did they think you were the adult in charge? Did he tell them that? Are they allowed to have friends over when he's out of town? It's the parents job to set the expectations.

Family doesn't mean you don't have personal belongings, sharing a living space doesn't mean you can't have personal belongings. My cousin has an entire drawer in the fridge he's taken over with stuff he buys for himself that no one else gets into without permission.", "NTA I think this is smart. You can be expected to do all the things a mother does with none of the authority. The authority part is over rated. The daughter expected you to cook for them and then ratted you out.

Ask him to define it for you.  \nYou sound reasonable to me, so long as you aren't expecting the 7 year old to cook for himself alone.  \n\nEta: So stupid, i know, but now all i can think of is being a kid and one sister was \"i know you are, but what am i\" -ing the little brother, and he howls \"WHAT ARE YOU!?!\" Lmao", "NTA...you respect them as individuals and treat them as such.

If that's the case tou really have no right to then have a problem with his daughter using the bath, she has likely always done it and youre the new person here.\n\nThe food stuff is also hard to tell who is in the wrong.

It sounds to me like these are differences in defining the phrase \"part of a household\", as opposed to a hard-line between step-parent and non step-parent.

Might feel silly but it\u2019ll put emphasis on how often they\u2019re taking your stuff", "But the BF does not want her to be raising them: He claimed that him not wanting me to parent his kids is different to me treating them like a roommate.\u201d", ">He claimed that him not wanting me to parent his kids is different to me treating them like a roommate.\n\nI mean he wanted Op to **not parent** the kids, but he still expects her to cook, clean and be a general parent for his children. \n\nOP shows she likes children and they seem to have a good enough relationship to have such honest and open conversations as the one being shown in the post, so i don't see how OP is showing any signs that she isn't a family type of person. \n\nShe literally respects the kids boundaries and treats the teenagers like they should be treated and doesn't undermine them, or forces them to obey her authority as a maybe some day step mother/the only adult in the house.", "Apologies you're absolutely right, I only saw the 4 children who are below 18.", "Yeah me too, tbh I\u2019d offer my roommate too never mind if they were a child or not lol. I\u2019m assuming from this post that his children lived in this home/ family setting for a while. Having a new adult suddenly living there and expecting to be treated like a roommate is such a weird dynamic and something that would take getting used to for them all.", "She's treating them worse than a friend who is a roommate would in my opinion.", "I didn't say she did anything wrong. The person who I responded to said something about them treating her like family. I'm simply pointing out that they (the children) do.", "I thought I had.", "Right, the role of a stepparent is to parent. I mean it is in the title. The dad doesn't want her to parent them, just take care of them by cooking, cleaning, and allow them to disrespect her. She didn't have a problem with them staying, even though their dad was not there. I wonder how do they treat their mom.", "No apology necessary I just find that 6 is more of a shock than 4 lol\n\nOP is very obviously dating a family man\u2026 or someone who wanted to be one and it didn\u2019t exactly work out. They have very different attitudes about kids so I wonder how they ended up together", "It sounds like the misconception is the difference of being the parent and being part of the household. They function as a unit. It sounds like when one person makes dinner, they make dinner for everyone. They pitch in when needed and all work together to make sure everyone\u2019s needs are met. Food, products, and spaces have likely always been shared. You seem to want to coexist without fully becoming part of that unit.  I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to jump in with both feet, but if your not willing or able to adapt, it may not be the living situation for you. \n\nTo your question I say a soft YTA. I think she was put off you didn\u2019t include them in dinner because that\u2019s what they do, and you basically said \u201cI\u2019ll stay  out of your way if you stay out of mine\u201d. That\u2019s not how they function and was probably hurtful to her.", "Yeah that's not your fault, it's your partners. You need to all sit down and talk about the dynamics of your relationships cause this miscommunication can't happen again otherwise the kids will see you as a lazy room-mate", "Couples can live separately, you know.\n\nIt seems pretty bizarre to tell kids who have never lived on their own to \u201ctreat you like a roommate.\u201d They\u2019ve never had roommates before, they are accustomed to being a part of a family unit where everything is shared. You shouldn\u2019t have moved in if you weren\u2019t prepared to be a part of that unit. The only thing they probably internalized from your conversation is that you don\u2019t see them as family.", "YTA, the kid is right, it was a dick move.", "YTA (kinda), but also woefully ignorant and setting yourself up for a bad time... A lot of people have mentioned it already, but who on earth would get into a serious relationship with a man that has six kids and not fully expect this dynamic? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of weird stuff in this post, but whether you like it or not, being a step parent (which is exactly what you signed up for when you moved in) means you do all of the parenting stuff without the authority to discipline. You aren\u2019t just granted authority over these kids bc you are sleeping with their father. You are ultimately the outsider here and if you want this relationship to work, you need to get comfortable with how the kids live within this space. That means other people are going to eat the snacks that you put in the kitchen, use the products you put in the bathroom, etc. If those are things you want for yourself, make sure you have enough for everyone. \n\nTo the people who say \u201cthe roommate analogy is great, that\u2019s a good boundary to set!\u201d \u2026 the only roommates a 17 year old child have ever known are their parents and siblings. They have no idea what it means to be a good roommate. It would be silly of you to expect that kind of dynamic from them bc they have literally no context, and unless you want them to hate you, you should not be setting roommate-style boundaries with children. \n\nSorry for the rant, I am speaking as someone whose dad\u2019s girlfriend moved in with him when I was 14 and still hate her 20 years later. It just blows my mind that she couldn\u2019t stand to be more generous with us for the Wednesday afternoons and every other weekend that my sister and I spent at his house.", "Nah, I'd be more comfortable nailing my roommate than my step-mother.", "Also sacrifice all her belongings (food, hygiene products) for them", "Except it is exactly how being a _good_ step parent works. Banging someone\u2019s dad doesn\u2019t give you license to raise them.", "no, they're treating her as a roommate they can take full advantage of without any consequences. \n\ni mean, eating snacks she *explicitly* said she bought for herself? using her products she *explicitly* forbade them from using? that's a shitty way to treat your mom.", "Why do you need control over them to be a decent human being to them?", "No but them cohabitating gives her the right to have her boundaries respected & they haven't done that either.", "But does that mean you have to clean up after them?"]}
