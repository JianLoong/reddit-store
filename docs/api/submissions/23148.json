We took two cars. One car with my family of five plus a nephew then another car with two sisters, an uncle, and a niece. We get to the restaurant and the wait ends up being two hours long so my wife calls her sisters waiting in the car and they immediately agree to go back to the rental to eat dinner. The sisters will pick up groceries to make mozzarella cheese tomato basil sandwiches for dinner. I know my kids will not eat that so I tell the wife I\u2019m going thru McDonald\u2019s for the kids. The wife calls her sisters to make sure they don\u2019t get offended we\u2019re going thru McDonald\u2019s for the kids and also to ask if we can order the nephew a Big Mac like he wants. \n\nHere\u2019s where the fight started. I tell my wife not to offer to buy them dinner. I don\u2019t want to buy everyone dinner tonight. I\u2019ll buy everyone in my van dinner, but they\u2019re in the car right behind us. If they want McDonald\u2019s then they can drive thru the line. Also, I know they won\u2019t pay us for whatever they want because \u201cfamily\u201d and we\u2019re sharing. I have no problem with sharing either. I\u2019ve bought the most groceries for everyone but this instance they\u2019re in the car right behind us so they can get their own food. My wife, of course, ask them if they want anything. Now, my first thought was I didn\u2019t want to buy combo meals for everyone but that didn\u2019t happen, they just wanted two milk shakes but at this point I was already upset she asked. I did order the milk shakes on a 2nd ticket. When we got to the window my wife handed me her CC to pay for the milk shakes. She didn\u2019t offer to buy the kids dinner or anything else but just milk shakes. She then proceeded not to talk to me for the rest of the ride home. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t talk to me when we got home, I go to the bedroom for 30 minutes and when I come back I ask her if she\u2019s still mad and she is. I end up drinking alone on the front patio all night until everyone goes to bed. We did talk for ten minutes on the patio where she told me I was unreasonable and \u201coverly aggressive\u201d. Maybe unreasonable bc the order ended up just being two milk shakes for ten dollars but in no way was in \u201coverly aggressive\u201d. \n\nStupidest fight in the world but I\u2019m not apologizing and neither is she.", "created_utc": 1690349120, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159wirh/aitah_my_wife_and_i_got_into_a_fight_over/", "score": 248, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They you got all bitter and twisted about your wife offering to do WHAT THEY had just done and get them something\u2026 2 f-cking milkshakes.

Suck it up, apologize, and move on.", "YTA \n\nWhat everyone saying about them paying for/making dinner is true. They also shouldn't have to go through the drive thru if you already are, it's unnecessary AND it would've meant they'd start dinner even later than they already were going to bc you didn't want to be courteous\n\nThe fact they were already going to make dinner also heavily implied they wouldn't want much, you were just catastrophizing \n\nBut, and this is kinda the biggest part to me: \n\nBuying everyone McDonald's combos was still going to be cheaper then the dinner at the restaurant you didn't have. You were still going to come out ahead even if they ordered for everyone.\n\nBecause of that, it's kinda just an AH move to be stingy and sulk over the situation", "YTA\n\nYou took a small situation and made it more than it is and now you\u2019re refusing to apologise to your wife about it which will make it an even bigger issue", "YTA because you are petty. It wasn't 5 combo meals, it was 2 milkshakes. For $10 you ruined your own night and your wife's. She deserves better. She deserves an apology. Her way, offering common courtesy to the people who were about to make dinner, was the right way. Especially considering ordering McD's when people say they will cook for you could be considered a snub.", "YTA. First, it\u2019s just common curtesy to offer \u201chey, I\u2019m going to McDonald\u2019s, do you want anything?\u201d I get it that you don\u2019t want to pay, so you either tell them how much it was after the purchase or you suck it up. Either way, offering to get them something is just the right way to function in a civilized world. Second, you are being aggressive in your comments and I can imagine you were being aggressive with your wife too. You said being aggressive is not being overly aggressive, but it is. Third, drinking all night because you had to pay for 2 milkshakes? Your pity party was probably more expensive than the issue. And fourth, sometimes you just need to apologize and move on from small stupid arguments. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re right or wrong, the relationship is more important.", "Not buying your wife\u2019s family McDonalds does  not make you an asshole. But making a point of not paying for them does embarrass your wife. Asking someone if they want something from McDonald\u2019s then sending them the bill isn\u2019t a good look and will embarrass your wife in front of her family. Trust me no wife wants her husband looking cheap in front of friends and family. \n\nLet\u2019s say she made the mistake of asking them what they want without discussing it with you.

It\u2019s McDonald\u2019s! What could it cost, Michael, $10? I mean really? It\u2019s family. They were going to pay for you. It\u2019s a pretty low cost spot generally.

It was 2 milk shakes. Not 6 combos with extras on the side. Don't forget the fact that the sisters were going to go buy ingredients to make everyone dinner, including you. YOU decided on McDonald's, offering is the polite thing to do. \n\nYou could have easily asked the sisters to pick up an alternative for the kids at the grocery store. McDonald's wasn't necessary at all. Hot dogs or hamburgers home made would have done the job too. \n\nAlso, you agree that it was unreasonable.

You weren\u2019t hearing her view either and when she continued to punish you with silent treatment you paid her back by drinking.. \nKind of clear you are both battling out some issue that is long standing that has nothing to do with milkshakes. \nTwo of you should have a long talk about what real issue is with ground rules you only get to talk about what your perception is acknowledging that may not be the facts. Each person cannot interrupt the other they have to listen to what other person says and then parrot back what they heard so the other person can correct them if that is not what they said it\u2019s all about making sure the other person is actually hearing what is said. \nYou both have to approach this willing to admit you may be wrong about what you perceived. It\u2019s not about proving you were right it\u2019s about both of you having the same understanding of what actually occurred. \nI guarantee both of you are wrong about parts of it. \nIt takes a lot of effort and isn\u2019t fun but well worth it if you live and value each other. \nAn active listening class you take together works be quite valuable to work out your issues and it makes you better parents as well.
