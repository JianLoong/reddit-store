We took two cars. One car with my family of five plus a nephew then another car with two sisters, an uncle, and a niece. We get to the restaurant and the wait ends up being two hours long so my wife calls her sisters waiting in the car and they immediately agree to go back to the rental to eat dinner. The sisters will pick up groceries to make mozzarella cheese tomato basil sandwiches for dinner. I know my kids will not eat that so I tell the wife I\u2019m going thru McDonald\u2019s for the kids. The wife calls her sisters to make sure they don\u2019t get offended we\u2019re going thru McDonald\u2019s for the kids and also to ask if we can order the nephew a Big Mac like he wants. \n\nHere\u2019s where the fight started. I tell my wife not to offer to buy them dinner. I don\u2019t want to buy everyone dinner tonight. I\u2019ll buy everyone in my van dinner, but they\u2019re in the car right behind us. If they want McDonald\u2019s then they can drive thru the line. Also, I know they won\u2019t pay us for whatever they want because \u201cfamily\u201d and we\u2019re sharing. I have no problem with sharing either. I\u2019ve bought the most groceries for everyone but this instance they\u2019re in the car right behind us so they can get their own food. My wife, of course, ask them if they want anything. Now, my first thought was I didn\u2019t want to buy combo meals for everyone but that didn\u2019t happen, they just wanted two milk shakes but at this point I was already upset she asked. I did order the milk shakes on a 2nd ticket. When we got to the window my wife handed me her CC to pay for the milk shakes. She didn\u2019t offer to buy the kids dinner or anything else but just milk shakes. She then proceeded not to talk to me for the rest of the ride home. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t talk to me when we got home, I go to the bedroom for 30 minutes and when I come back I ask her if she\u2019s still mad and she is. I end up drinking alone on the front patio all night until everyone goes to bed. We did talk for ten minutes on the patio where she told me I was unreasonable and \u201coverly aggressive\u201d. Maybe unreasonable bc the order ended up just being two milk shakes for ten dollars but in no way was in \u201coverly aggressive\u201d. \n\nStupidest fight in the world but I\u2019m not apologizing and neither is she.", "created_utc": 1690349120, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159wirh/aitah_my_wife_and_i_got_into_a_fight_over/", "score": 1461, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They you got all bitter and twisted about your wife offering to do WHAT THEY had just done and get them something\u2026 2 f-cking milkshakes.

It's time to get that stick out of your butt...", "You\u2019re probably just going to delete this post after everyone votes YTA, please go talk to your wife and sort it out it\u2019s petty.", "YTA.

Suck it up, apologize, and move on.", "YTA \n\nWhat everyone saying about them paying for/making dinner is true. They also shouldn't have to go through the drive thru if you already are, it's unnecessary AND it would've meant they'd start dinner even later than they already were going to bc you didn't want to be courteous\n\nThe fact they were already going to make dinner also heavily implied they wouldn't want much, you were just catastrophizing \n\nBut, and this is kinda the biggest part to me: \n\nBuying everyone McDonald's combos was still going to be cheaper then the dinner at the restaurant you didn't have. You were still going to come out ahead even if they ordered for everyone.\n\nBecause of that, it's kinda just an AH move to be stingy and sulk over the situation", "YTA\n\nYou took a small situation and made it more than it is and now you\u2019re refusing to apologise to your wife about it which will make it an even bigger issue", "YTA because you are petty. It wasn't 5 combo meals, it was 2 milkshakes. For $10 you ruined your own night and your wife's. She deserves better. She deserves an apology. Her way, offering common courtesy to the people who were about to make dinner, was the right way. Especially considering ordering McD's when people say they will cook for you could be considered a snub.", "YTA. First, it\u2019s just common curtesy to offer \u201chey, I\u2019m going to McDonald\u2019s, do you want anything?\u201d I get it that you don\u2019t want to pay, so you either tell them how much it was after the purchase or you suck it up. Either way, offering to get them something is just the right way to function in a civilized world. Second, you are being aggressive in your comments and I can imagine you were being aggressive with your wife too. You said being aggressive is not being overly aggressive, but it is. Third, drinking all night because you had to pay for 2 milkshakes? Your pity party was probably more expensive than the issue. And fourth, sometimes you just need to apologize and move on from small stupid arguments. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re right or wrong, the relationship is more important.", "Not buying your wife\u2019s family McDonalds does  not make you an asshole. But making a point of not paying for them does embarrass your wife. Asking someone if they want something from McDonald\u2019s then sending them the bill isn\u2019t a good look and will embarrass your wife in front of her family. Trust me no wife wants her husband looking cheap in front of friends and family. \n\nLet\u2019s say she made the mistake of asking them what they want without discussing it with you.

It\u2019s McDonald\u2019s! What could it cost, Michael, $10? I mean really? It\u2019s family. They were going to pay for you. It\u2019s a pretty low cost spot generally. You can\u2019t spare this basically normal reciprocal courtesy?", "YTA get over yourself and don\u2019t ask for judgement if you already think you\u2019re right. No one agrees with you", "YTA. It was 2 milk shakes. Not 6 combos with extras on the side. Don't forget the fact that the sisters were going to go buy ingredients to make everyone dinner, including you. YOU decided on McDonald's, offering is the polite thing to do. \n\nYou could have easily asked the sisters to pick up an alternative for the kids at the grocery store. McDonald's wasn't necessary at all. Hot dogs or hamburgers home made would have done the job too. \n\nAlso, you agree that it was unreasonable.

That's a pretty shitty assumption to make. Literally any other sane person would probably just buy everyone dinner and expect nothing in return, but be grateful if they did pay that back.

Restaurant busy SIL agrees to sort dinner\n2. OP thinks kids won\u2019t like the dinner so wants to go to McD\u2019s\n3. Wife wants to call SiL to let them know and offer to buy nephew (who is in the car with them) food.\n4. OP doesn\u2019t want wife to call as he doesn\u2019t want to pay for everyone to have combo meals (not what wife was suggesting but ok)\n5. Wife rings anyway and they don\u2019t want combo meals just 2 milkshakes. Wife wants OP to just add to the order (and therefore pay)\n6. Argument (OP accused of being overly aggressive)\n7. Argument over and wife agrees to pay for milkshakes so OP orders separately.\n7. Wife is upset with OP from argument (in which she says he was overly aggressive) and doesn\u2019t speak to him for the car ride home. \n8. OP goes to his room for 30 minutes and asks if wife is still mad. She is. \n9. OP then sits outside all night ignoring guests and getting drunk. \n10. Wife tries to discuss with OP on patio with no resolution. \n\nOp says the argument started when wife wanted to offer to by nephew dinner, OP didn\u2019t want to buy the in-laws food and wife did. Ultimately wife paid and the issue is resolved although both parties are upset.\n\nIgnoring that the wife was probably right: Firstly it doesn\u2019t say how old nephew is but I presume a kid/teen and she doesn\u2019t want him to be left out when he is sat in the same car and secondly OP acknowledges he was maybe being unreasonable. But once the initial argument is over I don\u2019t really see where wife \u201cthrew her weight around\u201d was it by offering to order after OP said not to. If so, why - this assumes that she should have accepted his side of the initial argument. Also it seems like this was resolved when she paid and a compromise was reached. \n\nThen if we look at behaviour post-argument and who got \u201ctreated like shit\u201d it appears gives OP the \u201csilent treatment\u201d for an unknown period of time (but probably less than half an hour) during the car ride home immediately after the argument has happened.\n\nOP then immediately does the same thing to both wife and her whole family as soon as he gets home by going to his room for half an hour (giving everyone the same \u201csilent treatment\u201d to guilt trip her).\n\nThe only difference is that when OPs silent treatment doesn\u2019t work and wife is still upset that apparently gives him license to continue to give everyone the silent treatment (treating wife and her whole family \u201clike shit\u201d remember) for the rest of the evening getting drunk on his own until they have all gone to bed and leaving wife with that \u201cincreased workload\u201d. I am not sure why you think this is acceptable but her not talking to him immediately after the fight wasn\u2019t. \n\nAs a final point you mention \n\n> if I shouted at my wife and expected her to buy my family dinner, she sure as shit wouldn\u2019t be cleaning up after me\n\nBut this fundamentally misrepresents what happened, firstly it appears OP shouted at wife (since she thought he was overly aggressive not the other way round) to not offer to buy nephew dinner. Secondly the issue isn\u2019t about whether OP was cleaning up after wife (or her family) but instead not doing anything to help with his own kids. \n\nI can\u2019t fathom the idea of thinking that completely ignoring guests for a full evening leaving wife to do all the work (with 3 kids) is a justified response to an argument but that not talking to someone for a car ride is \u201ctreating them like shit\u201d and completely disproportionate to exactly the same argument.\n\nETA - I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s in-laws OP only says \u201ca nephew, niece, sisters etc.\u201d so it\u2019s not actually clear if they are his family or wife\u2019s but I assume hers.", "Found OP\u2019s other account, lol.

He was probably pissed off that all they asked for was 2 milkshakes so that he looks like an even bigger asshole than he was already.", "\u201cI would make my kids eat veggies and fuck what the mom thinks\u201d \n\n\u201cbeing a good father is catering to your picky children\u201d \n\nif you\u2019re going to troll, at least pick a consistent side to argue.", "You just said it's no big deal for a kid to skip dinner for the night if they're being picky. Make up your mind.", "Teaching your kids to eat vegetables is being a good father.  Shovling garbage food down their mouths every time they whine is shitty parenting.", "Two different things but you\u2019re using them pretty interchangeably\u2026", "And the adults only wanted milkshakes, which is logical  because they had already said they were buying ingredients and making dinner, which was nice of them. \n\nSo the thing that he was so terrified of - paying for adult meals - didn't manifest.\n\nIn fact  he put the milkshakes on another ticket so his wife could pay for them.\n\nThis whole conversation was taking place in front of his nephew, who was in the car as well. His parents offered to make dinner and OP was like \"My kids won't eat sandwiches!!!\"   I'm opting the kids out of their dinner and don't ask the other car if they want anything in case they say yes. There was a kid in the other car too, the niece.\n\nThis whole \"My kids wont eat their dinner and I donr want to ask in-laws if they want anything from McDs\" convo is happening in *front* of said in-laws' kid. \n\nIt sounds like he wanted an argument so he could drink. The thing he wanted to get mad about didn't happen. He wasn't asked to pay for adult combo meals, he didnt even pay for the milkshakes.\n\nBut he had already started on the \"pick a fight, leave the kids and everything else to my wife while she's trying to have a nice time with her family, get drunk in a sulk\" plan and he wasn't going to stop.for anyone. \n\nAH move.", "Where did you get that info? I don't see it in the post at all. \n\nSounds like you're projecting you're own issues", "God forbid the kids have a grilled cheese with mozzarella.", "If you're going to quote someone, you should actually quote what they say, not paraphrase, and incorrectly at that.", "Jfc.  \"To me its no big deal\" means IF IT WAS ME. \n\nOp made the decision to get the kids McDonald's so they would eat.\n\nYour reading comprehension is terrible.", "\"Everytime they whine\" this was supposed to be an outing. Involved is \n\nOp\nWife\nUncle\nSister 1\nSister 2\nNiece\nNephew \nOPs children\n\nMultiple kids involved and a family function, and you want to use that as a teaching experience, do you I guess."]}
