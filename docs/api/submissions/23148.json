We took two cars. One car with my family of five plus a nephew then another car with two sisters, an uncle, and a niece. We get to the restaurant and the wait ends up being two hours long so my wife calls her sisters waiting in the car and they immediately agree to go back to the rental to eat dinner. The sisters will pick up groceries to make mozzarella cheese tomato basil sandwiches for dinner. I know my kids will not eat that so I tell the wife I\u2019m going thru McDonald\u2019s for the kids. The wife calls her sisters to make sure they don\u2019t get offended we\u2019re going thru McDonald\u2019s for the kids and also to ask if we can order the nephew a Big Mac like he wants. \n\nHere\u2019s where the fight started. I tell my wife not to offer to buy them dinner. I don\u2019t want to buy everyone dinner tonight. I\u2019ll buy everyone in my van dinner, but they\u2019re in the car right behind us. If they want McDonald\u2019s then they can drive thru the line. Also, I know they won\u2019t pay us for whatever they want because \u201cfamily\u201d and we\u2019re sharing. I have no problem with sharing either. I\u2019ve bought the most groceries for everyone but this instance they\u2019re in the car right behind us so they can get their own food. My wife, of course, ask them if they want anything. Now, my first thought was I didn\u2019t want to buy combo meals for everyone but that didn\u2019t happen, they just wanted two milk shakes but at this point I was already upset she asked. I did order the milk shakes on a 2nd ticket. When we got to the window my wife handed me her CC to pay for the milk shakes. She didn\u2019t offer to buy the kids dinner or anything else but just milk shakes. She then proceeded not to talk to me for the rest of the ride home. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t talk to me when we got home, I go to the bedroom for 30 minutes and when I come back I ask her if she\u2019s still mad and she is. I end up drinking alone on the front patio all night until everyone goes to bed. We did talk for ten minutes on the patio where she told me I was unreasonable and \u201coverly aggressive\u201d. Maybe unreasonable bc the order ended up just being two milk shakes for ten dollars but in no way was in \u201coverly aggressive\u201d. \n\nStupidest fight in the world but I\u2019m not apologizing and neither is she.", "created_utc": 1690349120, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159wirh/aitah_my_wife_and_i_got_into_a_fight_over/", "score": 5015, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They you got all bitter and twisted about your wife offering to do WHAT THEY had just done and get them something\u2026 2 f-cking milkshakes.

It's time to get that stick out of your butt...", "You\u2019re probably just going to delete this post after everyone votes YTA, please go talk to your wife and sort it out it\u2019s petty.", "YTA.

Suck it up, apologize, and move on.", "YTA \n\nWhat everyone saying about them paying for/making dinner is true. They also shouldn't have to go through the drive thru if you already are, it's unnecessary AND it would've meant they'd start dinner even later than they already were going to bc you didn't want to be courteous\n\nThe fact they were already going to make dinner also heavily implied they wouldn't want much, you were just catastrophizing \n\nBut, and this is kinda the biggest part to me: \n\nBuying everyone McDonald's combos was still going to be cheaper then the dinner at the restaurant you didn't have. You were still going to come out ahead even if they ordered for everyone.\n\nBecause of that, it's kinda just an AH move to be stingy and sulk over the situation", "YTA\n\nYou took a small situation and made it more than it is and now you\u2019re refusing to apologise to your wife about it which will make it an even bigger issue", "YTA because you are petty. It wasn't 5 combo meals, it was 2 milkshakes. For $10 you ruined your own night and your wife's. She deserves better. She deserves an apology. Her way, offering common courtesy to the people who were about to make dinner, was the right way. Especially considering ordering McD's when people say they will cook for you could be considered a snub.", "YTA. First, it\u2019s just common curtesy to offer \u201chey, I\u2019m going to McDonald\u2019s, do you want anything?\u201d I get it that you don\u2019t want to pay, so you either tell them how much it was after the purchase or you suck it up. Either way, offering to get them something is just the right way to function in a civilized world. Second, you are being aggressive in your comments and I can imagine you were being aggressive with your wife too. You said being aggressive is not being overly aggressive, but it is. Third, drinking all night because you had to pay for 2 milkshakes? Your pity party was probably more expensive than the issue. And fourth, sometimes you just need to apologize and move on from small stupid arguments. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re right or wrong, the relationship is more important.", "Not buying your wife\u2019s family McDonalds does  not make you an asshole. But making a point of not paying for them does embarrass your wife. Asking someone if they want something from McDonald\u2019s then sending them the bill isn\u2019t a good look and will embarrass your wife in front of her family. Trust me no wife wants her husband looking cheap in front of friends and family. \n\nLet\u2019s say she made the mistake of asking them what they want without discussing it with you.

It\u2019s McDonald\u2019s! What could it cost, Michael, $10? I mean really? It\u2019s family. They were going to pay for you. It\u2019s a pretty low cost spot generally. You can\u2019t spare this basically normal reciprocal courtesy?", "YTA get over yourself and don\u2019t ask for judgement if you already think you\u2019re right. No one agrees with you", "YTA. It was 2 milk shakes. Not 6 combos with extras on the side. Don't forget the fact that the sisters were going to go buy ingredients to make everyone dinner, including you. YOU decided on McDonald's, offering is the polite thing to do. \n\nYou could have easily asked the sisters to pick up an alternative for the kids at the grocery store. McDonald's wasn't necessary at all. Hot dogs or hamburgers home made would have done the job too. \n\nAlso, you agree that it was unreasonable.

You are mad that your wife dared to disobey you!\n\nYou ordered her to do something. \n\nShe did something else. \n\nYou aren\u2019t this angry about the milkshakes.

That's a pretty shitty assumption to make. Literally any other sane person would probably just buy everyone dinner and expect nothing in return, but be grateful if they did pay that back.

Restaurant busy SIL agrees to sort dinner\n2. OP thinks kids won\u2019t like the dinner so wants to go to McD\u2019s\n3. Wife wants to call SiL to let them know and offer to buy nephew (who is in the car with them) food.\n4. OP doesn\u2019t want wife to call as he doesn\u2019t want to pay for everyone to have combo meals (not what wife was suggesting but ok)\n5. Wife rings anyway and they don\u2019t want combo meals just 2 milkshakes. Wife wants OP to just add to the order (and therefore pay)\n6. Argument (OP accused of being overly aggressive)\n7. Argument over and wife agrees to pay for milkshakes so OP orders separately.\n7. Wife is upset with OP from argument (in which she says he was overly aggressive) and doesn\u2019t speak to him for the car ride home. \n8. OP goes to his room for 30 minutes and asks if wife is still mad. She is. \n9. OP then sits outside all night ignoring guests and getting drunk. \n10. Wife tries to discuss with OP on patio with no resolution. \n\nOp says the argument started when wife wanted to offer to by nephew dinner, OP didn\u2019t want to buy the in-laws food and wife did. Ultimately wife paid and the issue is resolved although both parties are upset.\n\nIgnoring that the wife was probably right: Firstly it doesn\u2019t say how old nephew is but I presume a kid/teen and she doesn\u2019t want him to be left out when he is sat in the same car and secondly OP acknowledges he was maybe being unreasonable. But once the initial argument is over I don\u2019t really see where wife \u201cthrew her weight around\u201d was it by offering to order after OP said not to. If so, why - this assumes that she should have accepted his side of the initial argument. Also it seems like this was resolved when she paid and a compromise was reached. \n\nThen if we look at behaviour post-argument and who got \u201ctreated like shit\u201d it appears gives OP the \u201csilent treatment\u201d for an unknown period of time (but probably less than half an hour) during the car ride home immediately after the argument has happened.\n\nOP then immediately does the same thing to both wife and her whole family as soon as he gets home by going to his room for half an hour (giving everyone the same \u201csilent treatment\u201d to guilt trip her).\n\nThe only difference is that when OPs silent treatment doesn\u2019t work and wife is still upset that apparently gives him license to continue to give everyone the silent treatment (treating wife and her whole family \u201clike shit\u201d remember) for the rest of the evening getting drunk on his own until they have all gone to bed and leaving wife with that \u201cincreased workload\u201d. I am not sure why you think this is acceptable but her not talking to him immediately after the fight wasn\u2019t. \n\nAs a final point you mention \n\n> if I shouted at my wife and expected her to buy my family dinner, she sure as shit wouldn\u2019t be cleaning up after me\n\nBut this fundamentally misrepresents what happened, firstly it appears OP shouted at wife (since she thought he was overly aggressive not the other way round) to not offer to buy nephew dinner. Secondly the issue isn\u2019t about whether OP was cleaning up after wife (or her family) but instead not doing anything to help with his own kids. \n\nI can\u2019t fathom the idea of thinking that completely ignoring guests for a full evening leaving wife to do all the work (with 3 kids) is a justified response to an argument but that not talking to someone for a car ride is \u201ctreating them like shit\u201d and completely disproportionate to exactly the same argument.\n\nETA - I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s in-laws OP only says \u201ca nephew, niece, sisters etc.\u201d so it\u2019s not actually clear if they are his family or wife\u2019s but I assume hers.", "Found OP\u2019s other account, lol.

You did not want to have to pay for more food, and the others that do not want the paid-for meal afforded by the other members of the family should be expected to foot their bill as well if they don\u2019t want to participate neither, not split it in two groups where one person/family is going to pay for it all on both groups. \n\n\n\u2022she paid for the shakes, yes, but imagine if the other car had wanted more than just that, it would have been a massive fight instead, with her complaining that he didn\u2019t help balance the damage between the two. It would have been disastrous, and fairly pricey. Nothing is worse too to say \u201cwe got you food, but we can\u2019t afford it. Can you pay us?\u201d It\u2019s embarrassing, especially if there\u2019s a preconceived notion that since you are offering to grab food, you are offering to pay for it as well. \n\n\nYou have every right to be annoyed. It was a violation of your fair feelings and desires to not want to pay twice for more food, when it wasn\u2019t necessary to volunteer to begin with. \n\n\nI want to add this final point, and that is we have hardly any context for what was said,  including, myself, about how it was said, and whatnot. it\u2019s just pure armchair judgements that are being made about one person\u2019s personal essay account of what had happened that made a rift between him and his loved one.", "I don\u2019t understand.

I know first hand that drinking and being upset with someone leads to the person who\u2019s been drinking to be aggressive.  Every single time. You started drinking like that over two milkshakes?

I'm hoping the comments give you some perspective on things, but seriously man.\n\nI'm a husband and father myself.  We do the in-law trips quite often as well.  So I can commiserate on changing plans, alternative dinner ideas, and modifications at the last minute.  \n\n>So we had plans to go out to dinner tonight. We took two cars. One car with my family of five plus a nephew then another car with two sisters, an uncle, and a niece. We get to the restaurant and the wait ends up being two hours long so my wife calls her sisters waiting in the car and they immediately agree to go back to the rental to eat dinner. The sisters will pick up groceries to make mozzarella cheese tomato basil sandwiches for dinner. I know my kids will not eat that so I tell the wife I\u2019m going thru McDonald\u2019s for the kids. The wife calls her sisters to make sure they don\u2019t get offended we\u2019re going thru McDonald\u2019s for the kids and also to ask if we can order the nephew a Big Mac like he wants.\n\nThere is nothing major here, but a few things.  *Why McDonalds?*  Additionally, you made a decision without discussing with your wife.  Just said, \"I'm going thru McDonalds for the kids.\"  Your wife on the phone with her sisters was the part of the plan to organize dinner.  You came in **aggressive** and just declared that McDonalds was happening.  Your wife then went into damage control and called her sisters back.  You forced her to call back because you changed the plan they had already worked out.\n\nLook man, my kids are sometimes picky.  In that instance you could have asked your wife, \"Hey honey, I don't think kids will want that, can you make sure they grab some PB&J\" or something.  Instead, you took what could have been a fun night making sandwiches spending time together and created it as a fast food grab.  \n\n>Here\u2019s where the fight started. I tell my wife not to offer to buy them dinner. I don\u2019t want to buy everyone dinner tonight. I\u2019ll buy everyone in my van dinner, but they\u2019re in the car right behind us. If they want McDonald\u2019s then they can drive thru the line. Also, I know they won\u2019t pay us for whatever they want because \u201cfamily\u201d and we\u2019re sharing. I have no problem with sharing either. I\u2019ve bought the most groceries for everyone but this instance they\u2019re in the car right behind us so they can get their own food. My wife, of course, ask them if they want anything. Now, my first thought was I didn\u2019t want to buy combo meals for everyone but that didn\u2019t happen, they just wanted two milk shakes but at this point I was already upset she asked. I did order the milk shakes on a 2nd ticket. When we got to the window my wife handed me her CC to pay for the milk shakes. She didn\u2019t offer to buy the kids dinner or anything else but just milk shakes. She then proceeded not to talk to me for the rest of the ride home.\n\nHere is where you F'd up.  You are willing to die on a hill about buying McDonalds.  A decision YOU made.  With the going out to eat and taking two hours, who was going to pay?  Was it each individual family?  What was the plan there?  When someone, YOU, calls an audible and simply decides dinner will be McDonalds, then offering to get for others is of course a good option.  That's basic decency.  I don't understand being upset your wife asked if they wanted anything when you made the decision for everyone to switch up the plan.  \n\n>She doesn\u2019t talk to me when we got home, I go to the bedroom for 30 minutes and when I come back I ask her if she\u2019s still mad and she is. I end up drinking alone on the front patio all night until everyone goes to bed. We did talk for ten minutes on the patio where she told me I was unreasonable and \u201coverly aggressive\u201d. Maybe unreasonable bc the order ended up just being two milk shakes for ten dollars but in no way was in \u201coverly aggressive\u201d.\n\nSo, once you all get back you decide to go sulk.  You made the decision to change the plan.  You bought McDonalds and modified the evening and instead of helping with that modification, you went and hid yourself away for 30 minutes.  You went to pout and hang your head and held a pity party for yourself at that point.  There is no nice way to say that, but when you're all doing family stuff together and someone isn't there, that absence is noticed.  So you've essentially created even more challenge for your wife here.  How would your absence make her less mad?  It helped you, not her.\n\nThen you go and drink outside instead of engaging with your family.\n\n>Stupidest fight in the world but I\u2019m not apologizing and neither is she.\n\nNo, it's not. For you, this is about getting McDonalds.  But this is so much bigger than just McDonalds.  This is a husband who decided to change a plan, got upset about others asking for stuff when he changed the plan, then instead of being actively engaged in the changed plan he ran and hid, and then sulked.  Be a good husband and apologize.", "AH you\u2019re just being a baby. Man up and take the L", "Regardless of how you interact with your wife, you\u2019re not willing to buy *mcdonalds* for your family? Obviously you have enough money to go out to a nice restaurant and have a \u201crental\u201d (airbnb?) for what sounds like some sort of family trip, but you can\u2019t afford McDonald\u2019s for another family in addition to your own? I\u2019d love the opportunity to get credit for buying dinner for everyone at McDonalds prices instead of nice restaurant prices.

But if you're asking for a Venmo, again, you shouldn't be going through McDonald's in the first place.\n\nThe fight isn't about you not going through McDonald's or buying milkshakes. The fight is about you acting like a fucking brat.\n\nIf you act like this all the time, I'd leave your ass in the dump. I wouldn't blame your wife if she did.

Unless you were planning on including your niece from the start, they heard you refusing to include her and just get food for them.

Even if there is, the split tonight seems pretty equitable.", "He's a jerk in several different ways. Honestly I already thought he was an asshole for showing up to a restaurant with a party of ten without calling ahead. The only amount of grace I can offer OP is maybe he's tired of his wife allowing his family to haphazardly make plans that he has to help make up for (restaurant plans being foiled and then sandwich ideas that clearly only appealed to the adults). It can be exhausting, and maybe that's why he was trying to draw the line at combos for everyone-- fortunately for him though, this did not even happen. Not only are they buying dinner for them but they're making it too (yes it's easy but it's still effort on their part). And OP resents the idea of even asking them if they want anything. He's this resentful over doing any amount of kindness towards them, which, unless they have done something truly egregious, makes him an asshole in that measure too. Getting them a milkshake for them handling dinner feels like a fair trade. He could have turned it into a moment where he and his wife got themselves something nice too, but instead it became this bitter competition for him.\n\nBut then abandoning his wife with her family and his children pushes it into mega asshole territory. I'd honestly have a little more sympathy for OP's feelings if he did not do this. Yes, it isn't right for her to give the silent treatment (it's a pretty unhealthy means of handling conflict unless you communicate that you need space -- but she may have done just that since at a different point she tells him she's mad at him). But doing so keeps the conflict between her and him. Him going off to drink alone impacts his children and lets them see that alcohol is a means of handling situations you don't like. It communicates that he can drop his responsibilities to them if he's mad. If he was just angry and quiet like his wife I'd be like \"yeah they both suck at conflict resolution\" but the act of doing this removes a lot of the benefit of the doubt. It makes people think that maybe it isn't that his inlaws have a pattern of sucking, maybe he's just a selfish person who resents any amount of generosity. It puts all of his actions that night into question.\n\nWhy'd they even go to McDonald's in the first place and have to open up the conversation if this was going to be that big of an issue? Why not just ask them to get some nuggets or something else for the kids at the grocery store? Why not call them yourself instead of having the wife do it if you were worried she was going to sign you up to buy dinner for everyone? It makes it seem like he wanted to make this situation to 1) punish his inlaws and communicate to them that he was annoyed by them 2) get into a pissing contest with his wife 3) give him an excuse to drink by himself.", "Am I the only one thinking parents nowadays spoil their kids too much?

No matter anyone else's feelings or perception on a matter, he would make it about himself. He was always the victim no matter what. Even when it was his actions that caused the consequences, it was still somehow my fault or someone else's fault. Usually my fault but you get what I'm saying.", "Dad gets to check out when he\u2019s upset. Dad seems to create situations where he\u2019s upset. Dad doesn\u2019t have to parent as much. Maybe dad found a loophole.", "I bet he walks away from the kids, too, because the kids and the wife are a package deal. When he was upset, he checked out on the family so he could drink alone. My guess is this isn\u2019t the only way he does this, and he\u2019ll do it if they get divorced, too. \n\nParental responsibilities don\u2019t stop just because you\u2019re unhappy with the other parent.", "Ooof that hits me in the feels as I\u2019m in a relationship where the dude does this. Ironically he needs \u201cspace\u201d only when our kid is awake but when I do dinner, bath, bedtime\u2026.it\u2019s frustrating that his space makes the family suffer, it\u2019s no good", "This confused me- if they were taking separate cars, why couldn\u2019t the sisters have gone to the grocery store and started on the sandwiches for the grownups, while he went through McDonald\u2019s for the kids? I mean, my solution would have been to ask the sisters to pick up some dino nuggets at the store, but I don\u2019t see why they had to stick together for this. Either way, sitting out on the porch all night drinking is a weird response, and seems disproportionate enough to have been the plan all along.", "I have to wonder if he actually offered to go through the drive through because of the kids or if he was pouting because he didn\u2019t like what they were making too?", "I know right?? We would have been happy to just have drinks if that's what they wanted.", "Oh it didn't go to waste don't worry about that. But it was quite hurtful that they did that.   \nThe husband ate plenty and absolutely raved about how delicious it was. Still felt bad though.", "Really weird behaviour.", "I went to check this and just found OPs whiny comments about how everyone thinks they're wrong. I feel so sorry for his wife, this guy seems insufferable lol", "Lol", "I\u2019ve been the niece before and it\u2019s disappointing to not be thought of.", "But only his kids. The other kids get no treat from OP!", "Maybe I\u2019m just too much of a country bumpkin but I have a hard time calling a tomato basil mozzarella sandwich normal food in the context of supper. Sounds awful especially if you hate tomatoes. I\u2019d be first in line to eat just about anything else.", "Sadly she\u2019s probably used to it", "In OP's story it sounds like he didn't say much of anything.", "Caprese sandwich sounds gross, but I'm picturing soft cheese, soft tomato on soft bread.\n\nHowever, they have a house so I'm sure with the same ingredients you can toast the bread, melt the cheese and bake a crostini.", "Her passive-aggressively paying for the shakes? If she didn\u2019t pay for the milkshakes, it would\u2019ve held up the entire drive-thru line and caused stress to the McDonalds workers trying to get someone in the car to pay for what was ordered.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you get to your conclusion that the wife has micro-aggressed now or in the past from this post. Maybe yes, maybe no. But the OP has aggressor aggressed by detouring away from the group, not seeing the other vehicle as part of his family also, and overreacting about a $10 bill for two milkshakes. He probably came off as hostile and unapproachable while he was on the patio drinking and his wife and the aunts were tag-team parenting all of the kids. Kids: where\u2019s dad? Answer: abdicating his parental responsibilities at the moment.", "> The sisters will pick up groceries to make mozzarella cheese tomato basil sandwiches for dinner. \n\nSounds like the family were planning on accomodating the OP. Who said they brought \"the most groceries\" all week - who knows. Is he counting how many squares of toilet paper people wipe with too?\n\nThis whole thing sounds dysfunctional to me.", "Are you serious??? \n\nShe bought her family a couple of milkshakes and then he ignored everyone and got wasted on the porch by himself. The wife is not the issue here.", "Lol what request?  It was an order or demand", "He doesn\u2019t seem to value the effort and expense of the person making dinner. \n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t these kids eat tomato cheese sandwiches? That isn\u2019t exotic food. Why didn\u2019t this huge group get a reservation?", "Lol what, her family offered to make food for everyone... Mozzarella is hella nice cheese.  Two milkshakes is nothing compared to those sandwiches I bet...  Dude only went to McDonald's to get the kids food according to op, I bet he still ate the nice sandwich...", "And their sammies are better than yours..", "I hope this gets more notice, I can picture this in a video.", "And they're like, he's hangry of course...", "Shit! I just woke up 2 kids laughing out loud at this.", "Either just yourself or everyone. Not just part of the people should be offered food. That\u2019s where the problem is. Especially over two milk shakes.", "Let\u2019s not forget the kid of at least one other person in the other car was with OP. Imagine how awkward it was for that kid to hear his family aren\u2019t worth even getting asked if they want food.", "Also nephew was with OP and wanted a Big Mac but neice was in the other car. He really thinks buying some kids McDonalds and not the other was a good solution and would go over well?? Exactly how involved in parenting is he because any reasonable adult would know that this is going to be a huge deal to neice and cause issues once they get back to the rental. \n\nHis wife offering is the bare minimum when making a detour like this especially when kids are the reason to make it but not the only kids on the trip.", "Also they literally just asked for milkshakes like?? The sister promised to buy the groceries and cook it - seems like OP doesn't understand that effort and time is also in a way a fee/payment.\n\nOP clearly is an AH, not only in this instance, hope his wife is on Reddit. YTA", "yeah. i do group outings with my friends and their significant others and it\u2019s really not that hard.", "We plan a grocery list the day we get there(taking into consideration the meals we plan on cooking, breakfasts, lunches, and dinners throughout the whole week, etc), and 3 or 4 people go get them. The bill usually comes out to $500-$600 and we split it evenly among the 8 adults. Of course we have to supplement throughout the week, and whoever gets more groceries puts the receipt in a designated spot to be split evenly at the end of the week.", "That was exactly the plan. He thought if his wife asked if they wanted anything from their McD stop that their whole car would order meals instead and he didn\u2019t want to pay for that. And had that happened, they could have worked the money out later. But he\u2019s furious that she asked and then only paid for what they ordered\u2026 even though he was the one who decided to take the kids to McD\u2019s.", "Yes that\u2019s very odd. So you\u2019re still friends? Any behavior at all similar since?", "i mean, it takes 2 seconds to ask the grocery store crew to also get their prefered cheese for grilled cheese while theyre there. then adults get tomato basil sandwich and kids get grilled cheese sandwich. basically the same thing and i know if i was a kid and i was told that instead of the stuffy restaurant with like 1 thing on the menu that i MIGHT like, i get a grilled cheese sandwich made exactly  how i like it, id be extremely excited. \n\nAnd honestly they could probably have just made basil tomato sandwiches for the kids and called it a grilled cheese with extras lol. unless they dont heat them up? idk i dont like tomatoes (so ive never had one, but google includes a grilled cheese version so its not unheard of) and that still wouldnt have worked for me, but neither would the mcdonalds burger lol.", "It also depends on the culture. In my culture it\u2019s rude to not offer someone food if you\u2019re ordering. The answer should\u2019ve been they all went in and sat down and ate. And called the sisters to tell them to not count them in for dinner.", "That\u2019s right, they\u2019re better than yours\n\nThey won\u2019t treat you, so I\u2019ll have to charge", "Every sip with narrowed eyes and that little bottom of the cup noise...", "He did note that she uses HER credit card. So it would seem they at least have different lines of credit.", "With HER credit card. This guy has money issues and/or is cheap", "We were friends for about 5 or 6 years after that, we drifted apart for other reasons. We never invited them over for food again, unless it was just quick stuff, burgers/hotdogs on the grill and a few beers with friends, but never an expensive dinner that took effort.", "Here the sister is, using her labor to make dinner but I refuse to pay for 2 milkshakes isn\u2019t the hot take he wants it to be\u2026", "Most kids would eat a cheese sandwich. He could have suggested they pick up some frozen nuggets to go along with dinner. I think he's the one who didn't want the sandwiches.\n\nThere's more to this story. Both he and his wife sound miserable together.", "I know you hate them, \n\nAnd their grumpy ways", "Yes, he meant that the people who were already planning to make a detour to get groceries so they could cook dinner for everyone in both cars should also have to go through the drive through line to buy their own milkshakes if they wanted them, because OP didn\u2019t want to buy anything for the people who were buying and cooking him dinner.", "How do you know it was unmelted? It sounds like she was making caprese sandwiches...which are usually melted.", "They didn't necessarily *have* to have the tomato in it... I didn't like tomatoes until I was an adult but I wouldn't have happily eaten what amounts to a delicious cheese sandwich."]}
