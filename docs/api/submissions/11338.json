And that she was sorry for what she had done in the past, and that she was young and stupid and that she changed a lot over the years.\n\nI told her that, while I feel bad for her circumstances, I refuse to agree to a co-leasing with her because of what she had done in the past and how it permanently affected the way I see her now. \n\nSo now, I have her friends blasting me that I\u2019m an AH for refusing to help a vulnerable mother of 2 and how I shouldn\u2019t hold a 10 year grudge against her when she was a young and impressionable woman back then (and that it was pathetic for me to be acting so childish and not know how to be more empathetic at my age), while my friends are telling me that my feelings are valid and that I shouldn\u2019t trust her because there is no way to determine if she really changed for the better in such a short time. \n\nSo, AITA and should I consider talking to her again about whether or not I should lease with her again to help her and her kids?", "created_utc": 1677793554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gf2fp/aita_for_refusing_to_colease_with_my_cousin_and/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The two of you have history, and you know better than most people what may have led her to make such poor decisions in adulthood. It sounds like you may be able to offer her considerable support based on that shared history, without risking your own hard-won stability. This assumes that she is not one of the people demanding that you help her financially, and that she, personally, accepted your \"no\" at face value.  \n\n\nEither way, though, NTA.
