And that she was sorry for what she had done in the past, and that she was young and stupid and that she changed a lot over the years.\n\nI told her that, while I feel bad for her circumstances, I refuse to agree to a co-leasing with her because of what she had done in the past and how it permanently affected the way I see her now. \n\nSo now, I have her friends blasting me that I\u2019m an AH for refusing to help a vulnerable mother of 2 and how I shouldn\u2019t hold a 10 year grudge against her when she was a young and impressionable woman back then (and that it was pathetic for me to be acting so childish and not know how to be more empathetic at my age), while my friends are telling me that my feelings are valid and that I shouldn\u2019t trust her because there is no way to determine if she really changed for the better in such a short time. \n\nSo, AITA and should I consider talking to her again about whether or not I should lease with her again to help her and her kids?", "created_utc": 1677793554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gf2fp/aita_for_refusing_to_colease_with_my_cousin_and/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The two of you have history, and you know better than most people what may have led her to make such poor decisions in adulthood. It sounds like you may be able to offer her considerable support based on that shared history, without risking your own hard-won stability.

Please consider blocking her, her friends and whoever gave her your number without permission. Talking to anyone about your credit is sketchy AF.", "NTA - hell, I wouldn't even talk to her never mind co-sign a lease with her. RUN!\n\nThe friends who are blasting you are free to open their homes or sign a  lease with her. \n\nYou have everything to lose and nothing to gain by having her in your life.", "NTA...you had to work really hard for your good credit...never let anyone take that from you. She will be a bad  risk. Helping someone should not come at your expense...", "NTA. I hope she goes through what she put you through, and more. Stop wasting your breath on this monster.", "She can go to local catered women shelter and get housing vouchers that way. \n\nShe ruined her own credit- and her judgement has not been great overall, separate from her AH of a husband. She needs to get out- and you can help with that or not but helping her get out is helping her pack her kids and driving them to the shelter.  Which is 100% MORE than she ever did for you when you were in a similar situation that she put you in.", "Your response every time, \"I understand that you are concerned about my cousin and her children. That is very kind of you. I will forward her this text and explain to her that you would welcome her to come and live with you. That way, you can rest assured of her physical and psychological safety and that of her children.\" And that's the response you give everyone of them, then you block them so they can't contact you, They are, after all, her friends not yours. NTA.", "It's not heartless. Sometimes life is hard, and you fought hard to get your life on track, you made good decisions. Don't let her mess up everything you have worked so hard for.", "Then she needs to work with the battered women's resources in her area. You FIGURED THIS OUT at 18 and no credit.  She can figure it out at nearly 30. It won't be easy.  But a shelter will help her fix her credit, subsidize her and perhaps even cosign through the agency.  But to do that she woudl have to cut hubby out completely- and to me this all screams that she is not ready to do that.  So you would end up endangered physically and financially again by the same situation you escaped from over the past 10 yr. GOOD BOUNDARIES are GOOD. Be strong in maintaining you stance.  If those flying monkeys can't help by cosigning, then they can give her money- with enough of a deposit, there are options as well. But they are asking you not to be kind- but rather to light yourself on fire to keep her warm. Do not do that.  You EARNED better.  Also- GO YOU!  I am so happy you made it through and I hope you have an awesome life! (Also change your number and block whomever shared with with your cousin- they are not your friend)", "NTA,\n\nJust give her the numbers to several women's shelters. Tell her your credit is awful. Then block her and block her friends. Block anyone she tries to weaponize against you. \n\nIf you co-sign for her, you will be responsible for her debt, and you know she's not going to pay. Having an eviction on your record is the quickest way to become homeless again. Don't do it. \n\nWith two kids, women's shelters are going to help her. She will have top priority. She doesn't need you.", "They have couches as others have noted.  If they can't co-sign, they can host. DO NOT light yourself on fire to keep her warm.  You fought hard to get here- and you deserve to maintain that security.", "This is such ridiculous logic. When you were 18, you both agreed to pool funds and get a place together, a place paid for by you both, that neither could afford separately. Relying on her promises, you did that. Then, she invited an abusive man into that home you shared, and kicked you out knowing you couldn\u2019t afford a place on your own. She broke your deal and her actions could have easily led to your death on the street. \n\nExactly what promises have you made, or what actions have you taken, to make her homeless? She\u2019s made all of the decisions here. The ones that made you homeless, and the ones that made her and her children homeless. You had no choices, made no promises, broke no deals to her. She made deliberate decisions to make you homeless, acting cruelly and indifferent to the effect on you. While she is responsible for your homelessness, in no way are you responsible for hers. You aren\u2019t doing the same thing to her as she did to you.", "Not even close. They are asking you to set yourself on fire to keep her warm. Exactly what would she have been sacrificing in not kicking you out?  She would have lost (maybe) her bed partner.  NOT her financial or physical safety- so not even close to the same! Becasue this puts YOU at both physical and financial risk!  Just because someone needs help does not entitle them to YOUR help.  There are social programs- and shelters.  She can go there and get help.", "Not your kids...", "NTA", "NTA. Putting aside your personal animosity. She's ruined your finances before, she'll ruin them again. You'll be on the hook for her rent and you shouldn't trust anybody but yourself and those who have *proven* themselves trustworthy. You've learned this the hard way at her hand before, don't let her do it again.\n\nOn a more personal level. She backed the wrong horse, and has destroyed her life the way she tried to destroy yours. Her being in trouble *now* doesn't undo what happened *before*. I'm sure she was used and was definitely in an abusive relationship, but that is *not* your responsibility. No matter what people say, you *do* choose your family. She didn't choose you, you don't have to choose her.", "NTA !!!! \nYou owe her nothing and I would not trust her at all and any friends that are blasting you in spamming you I would tell them great so you volunteer to take care of her because she\u2019s not my fucking problem. If you keep harassing me I will file a police report leave me the fuck alone I don\u2019t give a shit what happens to her. She is not my problem just like I wasn\u2019t her problem and she kicked me out at 18 years old and I had to be Homeless sounds like karma to me.", "That\u2019s ok. Please tell your friends to co-sign a lease with your cousin if they are so concerned. NTA", "8 years, it took 8 years for you to get yourself stable.", "NTA. Forgive but don\u2019t forget.", "Tell her generous and outraged friends to put their money where their mouth is, and do it themselves. NTA!", "NTA.  She and her kids need to go to a shelter for battered women and children.  You're not holding a grudge.  You're protecting yourself.  You would be responsible for her share of the rent if she flaked out and went back to him (or on to some other guy).  You would be on the hook if her kids damaged the apartment and she refused to pay for it.  You would have to pay if her abusive husband turned up and kicked down the door and laid waste to the place if she refused to pay.  It's entirely possible that both of you could end up being evicted due to the possibility of domestic violence if her husband shows up and goes berserk.  You have valid reasons for not co-signing a lease and living with her.  There are organizations to help her and her kids and that's where she needs to turn for help.", "You came from an abusive family & your cousin entered an abusive relationship, with a man who did what all abusers do, cut her off from her loved ones. \n\nI think you should rethink helping your cousin. Maybe moving in is too much, but I think you should help her flee.", "And if she regretted it- she would have reached out LONG before she needed financial help.  When someone only try to mend bridges because they need something----they are not mending the bridge, they are taking advantage.", "YOU are not responsible for HER choices.  SHE put her kids around a bad abusive person.  Not you.  And going to a shelter for battered women she would have shelter immediately, with safety for her kids. She had NO problem tossing you as nearly a child into shelters with bad people- this is just manipulation.\n\nYou are a good person- and good people have good boundaries.  And something I think is important:\n\nYOU MUST participate in your own rescue, or I cannot.  Or phrased another way- the good lord helps those that help themselves and so do I.  WHAT IS SHE DOING to help herself? Is she working?  Has she gotten help from a women's shelter?  NOPE- scejust wants YOU to rescue her.  She will burn you down and drown you before she ever does anything for herself. Help her by giving her contact info for shelters. With kids, she would be safe and sheltered with support immediately. Unlike what she did to you.", "Women in battered women's shelters are there for exactly the SAME reason she would be.  And why were YOU forced into a shelter- were you a bad person? I am not saying regular haters have no safety issues- you know better than I, they do.  But battered women's shelters????  This is PURE selfish manipulation. She will not ever stop sucking you dry if you let her start.", "Remind her that at 18 you were one of \"those people\" in shelters for a long time due to HER actions. NTA She's being manipulative to get her way, and as soon as she can she'll screw you over again, but it sounds like you know that.", "OP was in an open/homeless shelter- which can have safety concerns, especially for a young 18 yr old female!!!!  The cousin would be in a battered women's shelter if she really needed to be- which has NONE of those safety risks. It is night and day. OP wasp put at physical and financial risk 10 yr ago by this selfish person, and now she wants to do it to her again. NOPE!!!"]}
