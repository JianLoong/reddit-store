It sounds over-dramatic to say that a scare prank can cause a serious health episode...but it can.  A sudden shock to the heart and lungs as with an adrenaline rush *can* be serious. Or it could startle grandpa enough to have him stumble and fall.  And that can be just as serious.  \n\nAnd 18?  He's a bit old for a childish prank like that.   Brother needs to grow up and find something productive for his time.  \n\nGood for you on taking care of your grandparents.", "NTA. That\u2019s not a prank, that\u2019s a scare. Well done for stopping it.

Elderly people are known to have health conditions that could have included heart conditions. What was he gonna do if your grandpa collapsed, or the absolute worst case scenario happened? Say \"it's just a prank bro\"? \n\n\"Pranks\" like that are shitty. My brother tried it once, hid behind the door and jumped out at me.
