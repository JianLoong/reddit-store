Then same argument can be made as to why he has to pay her side of the rent. He does his job being the provider for the family. She needs to do her part by being a supportive wife.", "idk, you know how reddit is lmao. They think being a SAHM with kids in school is more work than 40hr workweeks.", "No one says she needs a job. Clearly her husband makes enough. But I can assure you she does whatever she wants between those hours everyday. And don\u2019t come at me with that cleaning bullshit, because she ain\u2019t doing that all day long.", "It should be.", "Lol my husband always got me flowers for special occasions when he was broke, yknow those cheap grocery store bundles. And I loved them so much cause I was broke too and couldn\u2019t afford to buy flowers often and I absolutely love to have them around the house. But now that we are doing a little better for ourselves in the last few months I always pick up flowers during my weekly grocery run cause it\u2019s $12 a week to make myself happy filling up a few vases and I buy individuals so I can kinda \u201cdesign my own bouquets\u201d  as a fun thing. He just complained to me that now he can\u2019t suprise me with flowers anymore since we have them all the time now. I was like NO! I still would love a gift of flowers from him, the more flowers the better :)", "I assume you mean purchasing like a bouquet of flowers, and the whole business involved in that... and not just flowers in general. Haha", "Yeah, that was my point. I mean he can\u2019t make himself breakfast.", "If his reaction was to immediately cut off her gym membership, then he has ALOT of motivation for spite. I would worry.", "That's what I was thinking. She might have to take his ass to court to make him have the kids for 50%....", "It happens. My ex husband was exactly like this guy. When I left I figured he'd barely want the kids because when we were married I was 100% looking after the kids, plus doing all the cooking, laundry, appointments, school runs, etc. I was shocked when he wanted 50/50. It all comes down to money. If they have 50/50 they don't have to pay child support (or pay as much child support) and they get a share in any benefits. That's why mine did it. And then got his mum to help with their care until the elder two kids were old enough to take care of the younger ones (he did try to get a girlfriend for the job, but the smart girl chose not to move in with him).", "There are all sorts of variations on 50/50. My sisters plan sounds like a game of Tetris to me.", "No? There are 4 weeks in a month. He\u2019s gone for two. Out of the two that are left, you think he should get custody for 1. \n\n1/4 \u2260 1/2", "My parents split custody 50/50 and that meant 6 months at Dad's and then 6 months at Mom's, in my case.", "would that not be 75/25? 50/50 means each parent has the kids for 2 weeks", "Whoa. Sweet lady, wtaf? That is a whole bottle of bitter pills. I am so sorry and sad for what happened. I wish i knew what to say...this so tragic. Peace to you, and blessings to you and your folks. \ud83d\udc97\ud83e\udd17", "\ud83e\udd17 good on you. Here is to your success and ascent, and best wishes for a fun journey to balance out the initial hardships. I hope you are proud of yourself! Happy friday, scholar, make it so! \ud83d\udc90", "Wow. What an absolutely beautiful thing to say. Much gratitude, and many blessings to you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f", "Ah, hugs and high fives. I regret what society has made of this choice of ours and some of the judgement and a lot of the lack of understanding...but yeah, no regrets on my boys. For me it would not have been accomplished were I working, and then I took on care giving for an elderly relative, but I hear you and wish you to join me in a rousing shout of \"balls!\" \ud83e\udd17", "This. People have really limited awareness of the realities of childcare costs vs. wages for part-time or entry-level work. You don\u2019t just \u201cget a job\u201d. First, you have to figure out childcare. And if you don\u2019t have a job, how do you do that? If your husband is a controlling AH who doesn\u2019t even want to give you money for a gym membership unless you wait on him like a servant, is he going to pay for childcare so you can work? Of course not. So, then what?", "Love and hope are powerful things, eh? All of this is true.", "Exactly.  It\u2019s unbelievable.  Somehow, taking his attitude about breakfast into account, I assume he expects her to do *everything* as though he\u2019s still not there.  It\u2019s *her job* after all.  24/7", "OH!  And he would come home from work and say, I'm not hungry, so we're not eating dinner. Which meant she wasn't allowed to eat.  She's diabetic.\ud83d\ude36And if she had already made dinner, she had to throw it out, because he hated leftovers.", "Exactly, add on the cost of a cleaner, cook & nanny, combine them all\u2026 it isn\u2019t cheap", "Yes! I was agreeing that $60/hr is cheap, if a Nanny is $30, then add all the rest!", "How does a parent with a full time job manage to do all that, I wonder?", "Well she could wear a French maid outfit to serve breakfast\u2026.", "Where does it say that in order for her to keep a roof above her head she needs to provide a full service breakfast on days where she\u2019s already at capacity? \n\nShe knows her workload. He is trying to add to her workload in a way that is unmanageable. He doesn\u2019t get to make demands of her just because her domain is inside the house and his is \u201cmake money\u201d. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to spend unlimited money. He doesn\u2019t get unlimited amounts of her time and energy (aka work).", "I guess meals just magically prep themselves. And god forbid she has some time off.", "I think both should be treating each other from time to time. It shouldn't be one way only.", "Depends on the person. I really don't see the value in flowers. I would prefer not getting a gift over getting flowers", "And doesn\u2019t seem to make any effort to help with the kids. Get up earlier to make me breakfast, not I will get both kids ready in the morning and help you . Nope zilch effort with the kids.", "Or just doesn\u2019t want too bruh also who\u2019s to say he doesn\u2019t care for his kids?", ">ALOT of motivation\n\n[The Alot is Better Than You at Everything](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html)", ">There are all sorts of variations on 50/50. My sisters plan sounds like a game of Tetris to me.\n\nI had a coworker once who told me that until she turned 18, she spent one week at moms, the next at dads. The two parents had homes one street apart, close enough the kids rode the same bus either way.  They had everything they'd need at both homes, so that the kids didn't take except their school stuff from one home to another.  \n\nThey'd just get off the bus on Friday and head to the home they had NOT left from that morning.  \n\nSeveral years on, she was happily married and out of all of that.  But her younger brother was still going week-by-week at age 20 or so, with no apparent plan to change anything.", "During the 2 weeks he's away they are both working.\nRight now OP is working 4 out of 4 weeks where her husband has 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off.\nThem splitting the 2 weeks off means they both have 3 weeks on and 1 week off per 4 week period.", "Thank you, that is so kind!! I hope your journey is successful!", "I felt pushed into it by my \u201cChristian\u201d upbringing/community. I use quotes because I no longer think Christ, or his teaching have such rigid gender roles. That came from the men trying to pick up after he was out of the picture. I can\u2019t say I found being a SAHM to be fulfilling, or even divine. It was stagnant, at best, on SO many levels! But that\u2019s just me.", "Yes! And it\u2019s not just \u201cthose minimum wage people\u201d that are affected like some seem to think. I went to 4yr college, and had about 5 yrs experience post college and was making about $52K/year with benefits, which was pretty solid in our decent cost of living area. \n\nDaycare was going to take AN ENTIRE paycheck. For one kid. If we had two, I would be working for nothing and paying someone else to watch my kids. Yeah, you can talk about \u201cmaintaining your relevance being worth something,\u201d but when faced with the actual reality of working for little to nothing or staying at home with the child/children you love, it\u2019s easy to at least empathize with why some make that choice. People who say \u201cwell you shoulda just kept working!\u201d don\u2019t always understand what that means. Just how some people can\u2019t afford not to work, some either can\u2019t afford to work or it would be a wash and they decide to trust, you know, a spouse who you are supposed to be able to trust.", "Holy fucking shit balls. That story was horrible from the first sentence and just kept getting worst.", "A parent with a full time job has the help of their partner.", "The answer is we barely get it done  and are constantly behind.", "Then why can't her husband do all of that when he has his 2 weeks off ?\n\nBeing a SAHP does not mean being \u00e0 maid.", "They don\u2019t get to sit on their asses and be waited on. Full time working parents pay for a sitter or ask family to help once in a while. Don\u2019t play stupid.", "Oh yea god forbid. God forbid her husband comes home and *gasp* wants an attentive partner for a couple weeks. It\u2019s crazy how selfish people can be when a woman is asked to do anything at all. If you can\u2019t handle a partner and kids, then please, go get a sugar daddy. But to act like all you have to do as a wife and life partner is take care of some kids is really sad. A relationship is more than that.", "I just mean the appreciation should be common, not the exception. I\u2019m so tired of men being considered amazing when for some, it\u2019s the bare minimum. Kinda like when people seem amazed that a father would watch their own children. No, he\u2019s not babysitting them, he\u2019s being a parent. Things like that.", "Custody isn\u2019t an allocation of free time. It\u2019s an allocation of physical custody - the presence and responsibility for the children. If they are with the mother three weeks and the father for one, she would have primary custody, not a 50/50 split.", "Custody split is based on the children's time.  50/50 means the children spend half of THEIR time with one parent and half with the other.", "So OP has the kids 3 weeks and he has them 1 week? How is that 50/50? It may be the right choice but that isn't 50/50.", "Yeah, Jesus would probably flip a few more tables then sit on the ground and laugh and cry at the nonsense. Oh, absolutely, sahm is like buffering, or at least it has been for me now that i am the end and moving into something else. I find some fufillment in how my kids are shaping up, but overall no. Nothing fulfilling about putting your all into being a wife and mother and house keeper and cook and chauffeur and on ad on, with no real financial stability in the way working moms do. Like, yes half is ours but it doesn't feel genuine when it is viewed as what you saved the house from spending (by being home) vs what is brought in from an income. Also shout out to those who don't understand that the motivating force of a wage is what keeps you doing your job, and that this job doesn't have that.

Sorry about that .", "Exactly.", "I don't see why not.", "We\u2019re talking about a man that is trying to force his to cook an elaborate breakfast on weekdays while he is off work.

That\u2019s not \u201cnormal\u201d and that\u2019s not bare minimum either. Plus most women I\u2019ve met at least definitely don\u2019t deserve that. Idk what his wife did to deserve that but clearly she was very special. And so was he", "Ah, thanks. The nice thing about Reddit is you can say what you think out loud. I know lots of SAHM who feel the same way, but we defend it so much it\u2019s like we feel guilty for changing our minds, and guilty for not loving it as much as we thought we would. Motherhood is wild, and so is whatever\u2019s life journey you find yourself on. Things seldom end up the way we planned it.", "I don't normally say that I'm glad people are dead, but.... yeah.", "Much like SAHM they do it whenever they can get it in. People act like SAHM do nothing but Peggy Bundy all day eating bonbons and catching days of our lives.", "And since this man is a working parent he can also doing that work when he is at home so that no one is behind and everyone gets a bit of a break!", "I do not think that that specific man did the bare minimum. He sounds amazing. My point was there are a lot of men out there that get treated like heroes for doing far less than is what is expected of their other half.", "I, for one, def do NOT think that.
