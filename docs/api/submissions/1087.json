Call your parents or a friend and book yourself a family trip or a girls trip while hubby stays at home with the kids for 2 weeks.\n\nIf he still insists on you making him breakfast, get a divorce. Life's too short to have to live with an asshole like him.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like he's a supportive partner. You can make breakfast for him when you feel like it not because you're mandated to", "He doesn't pay for your membership. You guys pay for your membership. Nta", "NTA. Let him starve. Hunger is a great motivator.", "NTA\n\nwhile home he should be doing 50% ... time for him to get up and get the kids ready, make your breakfast and then do the school run", "Definitely NTA\n\nYour husband needs to get his head out of his own arse. Getting kids and yourself ready for school in the morning is time consuming and potentially stressful! Breakfast, potentially fussy eaters, bags packed, teeth and getting dressed, potential lost things, the day to day moods and issues from a pre-teen and young child.. i could go on. I have a 5 year old and an 8month old so i get how overwhelming it can feel sometimes. I sure as hell wont cook a big breakfast first thing in the morning for anyone unless i know i have the time and in a mentally good place!\n\nIf hes not willing to look after himself while simultaneously bullying you by withdrawing access to your shared income i would find somewhere else to stay for a while. Either alone to make him realise how much you do around the house, or with the kids to wake him up to the reality that his stubborn outdated attitude will cost him his family.\n\nDo you have any friends or family who could help you out for maybe his next 2 weeks off?", "My dad has worked FIFO my whole life. Mostly 2 weeks on, one week off. 100 hour weeks as an electrician in gold mines. My mum is a SHAM. you know what he did when he would get home? He\u2019d buy her flowers the first morning he was home, and then would cook us all breakfast every morning and me and him would spend the days together so mum could have some time to herself. He\u2019d get me up in the morning and make my lunch and drive me to school. \n\nI\u2019m 28 and not *once* do I ever remember my dad demanding anything. And because of that I will accept nothing less from a man than what my dad gives my mum and what he gives me. \n\nNever forget OP, your children are listening. They are listening to the way their father talks to their mother, listening to the way you are treated, and they are adjusting their expectations and self worth on these things. Make sure you\u2019re teaching them what you want them to learn.", "NTA. The man is almost 30 years old. If he can't cook his own breakfast, that's a problem he needs to work out. You aren't his mother. There's no reason he can't make his own breakfast. \n\nSounds like the start of financial abuse. If he wants to pull that card, don't feel bad packing your bags and leaving. Let him take care of all his crap alone.", "I can understand once a week - Sunday maybe.  But once he's home, he fends for himself along with getting the kids up, dressed and to school to give you a break.\n\nNTA a million times over.  He should know how to pour a bowl of cereal.", "NTA. If you share the income why does he get to decide not to pay for the gym membership? Does he not do any childcare? Can he not get the kids ready while you make breakfast as a compromise?", "NTA. You're his partner, not his employee. You're allowed to draw boundaries around what is feasible for you, and he can either hire a personal breakfast chef or cope.", "NTA- it's not your job to feed him, his a grown man I can understand maybe here and there make him breakfast to be nice and stuff. He needs to understand your basically running that household when his gone and needs to pitch in those two weeks his home.", "NTA, he can make his own breakfast. The fact he is playing tic for tac now shows that he believes he can bully you into doing it by taking gym membership away. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, the kids need a good role model to learn from.", "ESH\n\nI say it's mainly your fault. By refusing to have a job and all the benefits and independence that come with it, you preferred to live the life of a housewife. What did you expect? \n\nWomen have fought for years to earn equal treatment, but this comes at a price (you need to get out of your cozy home and work - 4 and 11yo are old enough for daycare). If you want to stay home and have the husband provide for you, as it happened 100 years ago, you accept his male-child tantrums too. \n\nHe's an asshole too, he might as well cook his own food because he's a grown-up man. But he doesn't do it because you as a couple decided to live like in the '60s. Look at some old movies from those times to see the duties of the housewife.", "YTA.

NTA ? ESH ? it depends on whether you make money.\n\nDo you have a job ? because you say you share income but are a stay at home mom.\n\nPersonally I think it depends on the kind of arrangement you have. If you have a \"traditional\" arrangement where he makes all the money and you take care of the rest I can kind of see where hes coming from, however if youre also working from home then he should definitely be making his own food.\n\nPersonally I feel like each partner should carry their own weight, which includes making their own breakfast, but like I said if you have the \"traditional\" arrangement I can see where his expectation comes from.\n\nPlease dont misunderstand me as approving of his behaviour, its just a bit of a \"you reap what you sow\" situation IMO, you cant be a 50s house wife without 50s house wife expectations.", "YTA\n\nYour husband lives out of town for 2 weeks at a time to support your family.

That defeated the purpose of me working.\n\nAnd while they were at school, there were no jobs going for school hours as every other mother already had those jobs.  And all employers want full time employers.  And again, before and after school care would be what I earnt.", "Wow. That's such a derogatory way to view stay at home parents. She's a housewife, not a slave. She's not lying in bed watching Netflix, she's getting the kids ready for school. He has these options: make his own breakfast, or let OP make breakfast while HE gets the kids ready to school, or they can have late breakfast after the kids are gone.
