I (19 Genderfluid) have a two roommates, Ben(20 Trans FTM) and Adam (21 Trans FTM) who are dating. They both are very close friends of mine and we have been close since I was a freshman in high school. Earlier this year we had decided to move in together since we thought as best friends we should do that. Ben and Adam have been trans since around middle school and both are out to their parents. Ben and Adam are also both very active in the bedroom, sometimes I can't even invite people or my girlfriend over since they are very active, and at first it wasn't a big of a deal, I don't meddle in people's lives and they were my friends. But soon they started inviting a guy (22 cis male) friend over, which I don't know. Again no problem, it's a shared apartment and they can invite who they want. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut soon this guy starts spending more and more time with Ben and Adam to the point where they invite him for some bedroom time. And it's important to note that even though Adam and Ben are trans FTM, they still use the well, female genital for that time, and that's no issue to me but they have started to frequently have these threesomes. Last month is when something started happening. Last month Alex started having bad issues, saying he would feel well when he awoke and having bad cramps. He would spend hours in the bathroom and wouldn't leave until Ben or I had a serious emergency and had to go. Alex also missed his period last month but he blamed it on PCOS which me and Ben shrugged off since that wasn't uncommon, especially for me since I also have PCOS and have even gone 4 months without having my period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this month, the week passed again with nothing, and his issues have been getting worse. Which is why I started thinking back on the guy friend they keep bringing over, and mind you they still brought him over these past days and still went at it. I felt terrible for raising this suspicion on him but I knew what they were doing with their friend was unprotected, and there was a chance he could be pregnant. I kept this thought to myself for a few days before yesterday I had to ask, as this didn't stop and it worried me. Of course I felt bad myself for asking him to take a pregnancy test but it was only to make sure after he had refused to see doctors when me and Ben advised him to. Well Alex blew up at me saying how could I say that and make him feel even less of a boy. He called me names and transphobic for even suggesting for him to take a pregnancy test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow Alex and Ben won't speak to me and are staying over at the guy friend's house. Some of my friends say what I did wasn't wrong and I was only concerned but other of my friends say I was horrible to ask such question knowing he is trans and invalidate his feelings and push further his dysphoria. I feel really guilty but I just want to help my friend, so am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1668525166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvzx5h/aita_for_telling_my_trans_friend_to_get_a/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ben needs to go the doctor, any kind of doctor. They will probably do a pregnancy test. \n\nI had a friend once who didn't know she was pregnant until she was 6 months. I had told her I suspected she was pregnant due to weight gain, no period, cravings, breast enlargement, everything you'd expect. She didn't want to know. She ended up having a misc@rriage at our work and that's how she found out officially. \n\nBen needs to know for sure as not knowing could endanger him. He needs to understand that his health is more important than a \"transphobic\" comment. Which it isn't. He has the plumbing for baby making. Being trans doesn't negate the fact he can still get pregnant until the plumbing is removed, testosterone or not.", "NTA\u2014 so Ben talks to you about his period and about having sex with his vagina, but merely mentioning a possibility of pregnancy makes you an AH? \n\nIf he thinks that\u2019s triggering, he\u2019s in for a bumpy ride.", "NTA I am a pro-trans advocate and I still feel comfortable saying that all the gender euphoria in the world can't protect a trans man from his fertility. The physical realities of our bodies can make us all uncomfortable at times, but denial isn't the solution.", "NTA. But your friends are idiots. Not for living their life the way they want to but for not being cautious and using protection. Pregnancy is a very real problem for them. Irresponsible at its finest.", "NTA Just because someone has partially transitioned does not mean that they cannot get pregnant.  Being safe about sex is still important no matter what gender you are.  With those issues I would say get pregnancy AND STD/STI testing done.", "I'm not trans so can't speak to your exact question, but if one of them is pregnant, they're going to get steamrollered by their own gender dysphoria, very badly.  Sounds like they're in denial by not going to the doctor, whether it's about pregnancy, STDs, or any other malady of their...non-preferred version...of their genital and reproductive system", "NTA; none of this is trans bashing. It's a logical step to rule out potential medical issues. If its not pregnancy, then its something ***else*** severe that needs to be checked. Body dysmorphia sucks, and it sucks that Alex has to suffer through it, but when your body still has those working organs you can't just pretend they don't work unless you get the requisite medical procedures to ensure they don't.", "It is not transphobic to suggest that a person who has a vagina and has been having sex with a person who has a penis may be pregnant. It is an acknowledgement of reality. NTA.", "NTA, it sounds like you were as respectful as possible and weren\u2019t dismissive of his gender identity. I would also suggest (maybe even more so than a preg test) that he gets a full STD/STI panel done as that could also lead to some symptoms that would keep him in the bathroom for some time. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. You warned them. They didn't like it. It's out of your hands now.", "NTA. It's not transphobic to suggest to a trans man who has been sexually active with a cis man that he might be pregnant. His body doesn't care about his feelings - it cares about whether some sperm was deposited in his vagina at a time when he was fertile.", "NTA this is weird and stupid.", "NTA\n\nConsidering their biology and activities, it was a valid question.\n\nThey need to see a doctor whether it's a pregnancy or not.", "Dysphoria or not, biology is biology and Alex needs to face facts. NTA.", "nta. trans guy here! that\u2019s\u2026. not transphobic. you were suggesting something that sounds like it could be a possibility. sure, it could be dysphoria inducing, but if he feels this way about just TAKING the test, i don\u2019t think actually being pregnant would go over well", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a valid question and you guys are close enough to ask each other personal questions. \n\nLooking forward to the update!", "Nta. How utterly immature of them. My God,  this world is going to hell in a handbasket.  Biology doesn't give a shit about your orientation. Jesus. Them and your friends who are on your case need to grow the fuck up.", "NTA. Him being transgender doesn't mean that he can't get pregnant. He needs to be realistic with that even if it can hurt him. You did nothing wrong, don't worry. That has nothing to do with transphobia.", "NTA\n\nIt is a tricky situation for sure, but you had your friend's health and best interests in mind. If they're still able to get pregnant (and they aren't using protection with this 3rd man) then it is a really high possibility that he *is* pregnant.\n\nNonetheless, they really should at least go to a doctor to see what is going on to make sure it isn't anything that could put him in harm's way.", "NTA.  Regardless of his gender if he has the plumbing for baby making and put an uncovered penis in there he might be preggers.  He also might have a really nasty STD so he needs to get both tested for.  You approached him in a thoughtful and compassionate manner with concern for his health", "NTA. Make him feel less of a boy PLEASE. He has a vagina and is using said vagina like a woman would. AND WITHOUT PROTECTION NO LESS. It is going to be a very rude wake up call when it turns out he is in fact pregnant but denied it for so long he can't get the old abort.", "NTA. Feelings have no weight on facts of the physical, and if they were using their female anatomy with their friends male anatomy during threesomes without protection, they could very well be pregnant no matter how they identify. No matter how they feel now, they are going to feel way worse physically and mentally if they put off finding out. They could easily be pushing it from their mind as a possibility because of their transition (denial is a hell of a drug), but they need to be aware of the possibility and get it checked out asap.", "NTA", "NTA. what did they expect?? I do feel bad for him though if he really is pregnant. That\u2019s definitely going to take a toll on his mental. Does he have a therapist? If not, he needs to see one.", "NTA- there's a lot to unpack here that I don't feel qualified to speak to, but the basic issue of pregnancy is a very logical conclusion that is easily and cheaply tested. And frankly, it is unreasonable(irresponsible?)to rule it out on the basis that he simply does not want to consider that possibility. Especially given the legal issues of the day where he may have a limited time frame to be able to consider the full options that are available.", "NTA - Your friend is a man, but that does not mean that he cannot get pregnant. That is a reality of his situation, just like continuing to have his period or having PCOS.", "I've never had pregnancy cramps - just labor pains. So, I'm concerned that there is no evidence of pregnancy? At any rate, you tried to help. Now leave them both be. NTA. Your intentions were good.", "NTA, you clearly respect his pronouns and acted out of concern. However, if he is on hormones he probably isn\u2019t able to get pregnant.\n\nEdit: It was pointed out that my information was incorrect, hormones do not significantly decrease likelihood of pregnancy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So, pregnancy is a legitimate concern. \n\nBut I would suggest just apologizing and not pushing it any further. If he wants to live in denial, he\u2019s only going to see you as the bad person if you suggest it again.", "NTA Your friend needs to crack open a biology book and learn that just becuase you are trans doesn't negate the fact that they have a fully functioning vagina,uterus and is producing eggs. And introducing sperm to the mix can create a pregnancy.\n\nDoes that make them less then just a fact. Does that make you homophobic absolutely not. Means you have common sense to suggest that as a way to eliminate a possibility.\n\nI would start looking at other options to move to. No point in living with people who can't accept common sense and simple biology.", "As a trans dude with PCOS, if my friend thought I was pregnant I would panic and get tested immediately. PCOS can make it very hard to tell and pregnancy is a huge no for me. Their reaction was completely out of proportion. NTA.", "Carrying a pregnancy is probably going to be much more dysphoric than taking the test. He needs to know so he can get an abortion if he doesn't want to be pregnant", "Trans men can get pregnant if Ben has been having (loud) unprotected sex and experiencing pregnancy symptoms than he might be pregnant. That's just facts. NTA", "NTA -- Not a transphobe. You just have stupid roommates. \n\nEdited: I removed a joke I realized isn't accurate, and could be seen as supporting transphobia. Not my intention at all. My point was that if you have the parts that make you pregnant, you can become pregnant.", "Also, if Ben *doesn't* want to be a seahorse (or not yet, or not like this) then the sooner he does something the better for all concerned. Even if he lives somewhere that allows abortion after, say, 12 weeks after that it's not a pill and a killer period, it's an invasive and unpleasant procedure which is going to be a *lot* more triggering for body dysphoria.", "I think it's actually Alex not Ben", "I think it's Alex that OP is suggesting maybe pregnant not Ben", "This. Theoretically, any male hormones he's taking are likely to reduce fertility. And PCOS can have similar effects. But neither of those makes it impossible to get pregnant, and if you have those two situations cohabiting in the same body, it's likely to make for a really unpredictable outcome that needs monitoring until your doctor's certain they know what your body's doing with those hormones.", "2 missed periods and cramps are a good indication to take a test. I had some minor cramps with mine right around my usual period week, and some odd crampy feelings down there for a while after. Of course, I was _trying_ to get pregnant so I tested right away, but I'd definitely recommend a test in this case. Or, like another commenter said, an STD/STI panel AND a pregnancy test", "Pregnancy cramps are very normal, as implantation can hurt in a way that's perceived as cramping and then the early stretch of the uterus feels a *lot* like a period to many (me included!)", "This is not true. While there are still studies being conducted, testosterone hormone therapy may possibly suppress egg development, but does not serve as a form of contraceptive. While studies have shown a decreased possibility of a successful fertilization due to the possibility of testosterone altering the composition of the ovaries, trans men or NB people on hormone therapy still may become pregnant.", "Is seahorse actually a term used or are you just making the comparison?", "You right. Brain does not remember names even if they're staring me in the face!", "I read it as one missed period. Thanks.", "Thank you, I knew it wasn\u2019t fool proof and I will edit my comment.", "It's a real term, \"seahorse dad\" :)", "No worries! It's not the easiest to keep track of tbh", "I almost messed up twice. I saw Adam and thought you meant Adam instead of Alex LOL my coffee ain't strong enough this morning it appears."]}
