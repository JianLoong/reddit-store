For example, she had a tantrum when my nephew took a turn to play on the TV. She had the TV for more than three hours and it was time for my nephew to get a chance. She began sobbing and I sat her down on the couch and told her \u201cwe\u2019ve been watching you play your games all day. It\u2019s time my nephew gets a chance to play.

But my family acts as though I\u2019ve been bullying her. They feel bad for her and make accommodations for her to make her stop crying instead of showing her she will not always get the things she wants. It\u2019s been driving me crazy.\n\nMy nephew is a jerk. He\u2019ll say things to me that are completely disrespectful and his parents won\u2019t do anything about it.

And they don\u2019t see and understand why that\u2019s a problem because their parents never taught them the importance of money. I\u2019m so drained from them I can\u2019t do it anymore.\n\nYesterday I had notified their parents I will no longer be watching them after Christmas break is done. I cannot do it anymore.

Their parents need to find other options.", "NTA.\n\nAt the very least you need a break, and they (the whole family) need a reality check.", "NTA. You do know that you are NOT obligated to watch these children right? It's one thing to try and forget a relationship with them but once you realized they didn't care unless it materially benefitted them you were free to spend your time and money doing other things and if other family members have something to say about it ignore them. Again you aren't obligated to spend your time and resources on people who don't appreciate it nor respect you.", "NTA - its better that you give the kids and parents a clear example of what happens when they disrespect boundaries.", "NTA.  You have no obligation to watch their children (unless you signed a contract you forgot to mention).", "NTA - you need to look after yourself, end of story. Even if you were watching them in exchange for money, you don\u2019t deserve to be subjected to that sort of treatment. \n\nYour sibling and his/her partner are raising a couple of very spoiled children who are going to be poorly equipped to deal with the real world. I get that you are trying to teach them to behave better, but unfortunately unless her parents/the rest of your family provides consistency in that approach, you are just going to seem like the hardline outlier.", "NTA\n\nIts not disowning. They've been raised to be kids no one wants to be around. That's the adults faults and its time they face the consequences. This is mild compared to the disdain people will have for your niece and nephew as they get older, which will be an unfortunate wake up call they wouldn't need had their parents actually raised them to not be spoiled brats.", "NTA. It also sounds like you're not being paid and that you yourself are young.\n\nIt almost sounds like you're the primary parent, given how you \"have\" them 6 days a week. This is why kids shouldn't parent kids. I suspect your niece and nephew act out because they feel abandoned by their parents. \n\nYou need to refuse to watch them unless you are being paid at least 20$ an hour. Leave if they try to make you.", "NTA It seems you have been their doormat a very long time. It is long overdue a retreat from your toxic family.", "NTA. Those kids sound like little shits, and it sounds as though it\u2019s down to bad parenting. \n\nIt\u2019s a good thing to teach kids that they won\u2019t get everything they want in life. Trying to always accommodate a spoiled child\u2019s needs will lead to them expecting that in the future. I\u2019m struggling to picture an 11 year old throwing a tantrum in such a way - it sounds like something a toddler would do (and even then, it would require tough love). It also seems as though they\u2019ve been brought up to value materialism over all else, of which is only going to make them selfish and entitled. \n\nPerhaps \u201cdisowning\u201d them is a bit harsh considering they\u2019re both still young and have time to change over the years, but you definitely shouldn\u2019t be responsible for taking care of them when they\u2019re treating you like this. You did the right thing by telling their parents you would no longer be watching them.", "NTA. You don't have to put up with them. You can reference how everyone says you are doing a bad job, are bullying, etc. as the reason. \"I'm just not qualified to take care of your children because of my parenting skills\" is a good phrase.

Why are you waiting until after Christmas break?  Ship them home immediately.", "Oh thank God I thought this was going to continue with you watching the kids. Well done on putting a firm NO to watching their bratty kids. NTA and don't back down.", "NTA and frankly I don't know why you agreed to watch them at all. They are being raised to be the most despicable people ever. Good for you for setting boundaries. I wouldn't even keep watching them during break.", "INFO - how much have you watched them?  You say \"anytime their parents go off to work,\" but then \"I think they've been very spoiled\" as if you're not sure or haven't been close enough to know?\n\nOverall this sounds like you're not well-suited to the childcare profession and it sounds like your family has unrealistic expectations of you, so I'd say NTA.", "NTA - but what are you doing while their parents are at work?  Do you work?  \n\nYou're their uncle, not their parent.  It's not on you to raise them or worry about if they're spoiled or whatever.  Just be the fun uncle.", "NTA \u2026\u2026but \u2026.. you are being paid to do a job, so technically you are quitting the job. I wouldn\u2019t quit the kids.
