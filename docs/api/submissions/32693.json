People become overly concerned with policing others without having anywhere close to the full story, and they feel entitled to the world without realizing the world isn't even close to equitable for everyone.", "NTA. If you are disabled, then you are disabled.", "Absolutely NTA!", "NTA! You were sitting clearly assigned for people with issues like you.

She was acting rude and entitled NTA", "NTA 100%!!!!!!!", "Never feel badly for using the seat you needed, and one that is actually already reserved for your use.", "NTA", "NTA, and it saddens me you are doubting yourself here.", "NTA. Like any other seat on the bus, the disabled/stroller seats are first-come first-serve. You have a disability and got there first, therefore, seat is yours. It\u2019s unfortunate when there are more people who need seats than there are seats, but that\u2019s just the bus sometimes.", "NTA. It\u2019s that easy.", "NTA tell her to fk a dude with a car next time", "NTA. She was flat out wrong and you were entitled to sit there. She was not.

Disability takes priority in those spaces\u2026 where I live, if they\u2019re taken or needed by disabled and you want on the bus then you fold your stroller up and put it on the storage part at the front or you wait for the next one.

You\u2019re a person with an invisible disability, that requires a visible mobility device. Saying it that way as there are folks with MS that as folks with MS may have visible or invisible symptoms. Those seats are for you! And under no circumstances are you expected to get up for a person with a stroller. Anyone else in any seat could have.", "NTA, OP.  That entitles momster was the AH", "That's messed up man. NTA fuck that lady. You were there first, you have a disability, you needed the seating for folks with disabilities. She had other options and you didn't without it causing you a lot of discomfort. MS is no joke. Would she be judging someone in a wheelchair for not moving either?\n\nPeople suck. Sorry you had to deal with that shit.", "Definitely not the asshole. I have a handicap placard. I went to go into a store. It was in my mirror. Some guy started screaming at me from behind.

Lol!!!", "Even if she was pregnant, someone who uses a walker should get precedence over someone who was pregnant. The only person who trumps someone who uses a walker is a wheelchair user because they are even more limited as to which seats on the bus they can access. Her huge stroller is her problem.", "In some places, mobility aids ALWAYS trump strollers. If someone with a mobility aid needs the space, you have to either fold the stroller or get off and wait for the next bus.", "Cole Porter informs us that even educated fleas do it.
