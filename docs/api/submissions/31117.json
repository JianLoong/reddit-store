Two good friends of ours were visiting from out of town and we wanted to gather people together for an early Thanksgiving. Including us, there were 13 people attending. I purposely invited specific people that I consider close friends and who our guests are also friends with.\r  \n\r  \nOur group of friends has had a tendency in the past to be a little more free and open with gatherings, casually allowing friends of friends to come and go as they pleased. I have never been a fan of this as I like to know who is going to be there and also, if I'm being honest, I can't relax around some of these other people. It's not that they're bad people, but we're just not on the same wavelength or I don't know them well enough to feel at ease with them. I have tried to set boundaries about this in the past when we\u2019re hosting and it was sometimes ignored. I have been pressured in the past to include people I did not want to.\r  \n\r  \nThis time around I really wanted just close friends, and to feel comfortable and relaxed. Just as people are supposed to be arriving, our friend Alex messages the group thread to say that Grant is insisting on coming. Grant is someone I consider a \"fringe\" friend. He is not someone I or my husband are close to. He's an odd guy. Not a bad guy, but very socially awkward in a way that makes me uncomfortable (not getting social queues, showing up uninvited, saying weird things that it's difficult to have a response to, etc.). I did not want Grant to come. I told Alex that we did not have enough space (which was true although we could have squeezed him in).\r  \n\r  \nAnother friend, Hannah, spoke up on the chat that surely we could find room for him. Alex told me that Grant was insisting on getting in his car and coming too. At this point I was really flustered because I was trying to finish up cooking and the whole situation was stressing me out. Finally, another friend backed me up and told everyone it was a hard boundary and to please convey that to Grant. Grant did not end up coming.\r  \n\r  \nIt ended up being a lovely evening, but I did feel guilty about the whole thing. I just wanted a relaxing fun night with people I enjoy being around. There was some awkwardness with Hannah and Alex. Alex was apologetic but Hannah said that she could have brought Grant as her plus one, which I didn't really have a response to because I didn't say anything about plus ones in the first place. I feel bad that I am just not a person with a \"the more the merrier\" mindset. I'm pretty introverted and so are others amongst our friends. Most people said I was all good and backed me up, but Hannah definitely seemed off and I got the feeling that some people felt I was making a big deal out of nothing and should have just let him come along.\r  \nSo, am I the asshole for not allowing a last minute plus one to our dinner?\r  \nTLDR; I rejected a last minute request for an extra person at our dinner party.

You aren't alone in your thinking. You just can't please everyone all the time. You don't need to. Once people know and accept that you like hosting dinner parties with a set guest list they will stop trying to invite people last minute and it will become normal to them. The \"more the merrier\" parties can be enjoyed at other people's houses -- and the intimate dinners at yours.\n\nIt was rude of Grant to invite himself last minute and insist on coming anyway.", "NTA. I don't really know how to handle these situations either, but I one had plans to meet a friend and someone tried to invite himself along, and my friend bluntly but tactfully shut it down saying \"I'm sorry, but this dinner is invitation only.\"", "NTA and don't hesitate, next time, to say to Alex and Hannah that you're not a fan of Grant, and while you don't mind when he's around in general, you didn't really want him at your party.

We have planned for only the 13 invited guests this time- not plus ones and especially not very last minute plus ones.\u201d", "NTA. Inviting extra guests to someone else's dinner party is absolutely innapropriate. Arguing after the first No is also innapropriate.  Personally, I'd tell anyone who had ideas about who I should invite into my home and cook for, that they are welcome to host and cook next year and allow as many plus ones as they like in their own home.", "Socially awkward like demanding to join a dinner he isn't invited to at the last minute? \n\nHere the error was Alex's for talking to Grant about a social occasion he wasn't invited to.

Refusing to feed someone on thanksgiving is kinda anti the whole point of the holiday, yanno, and since Alex was bringing casserole, this was apparently a potluck dinner, which means there was enough food to have him over.\n\nThat being said: your house, your rules, so Hannah should have accepted your decision.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You said no guests beyond the guest list you invited. \n\nShe \"could have brought Grant as her plus one\"???? As if a plus one is always an option any time friends get together? Was she raised in a barn?", "Dinner parties have guest lists, not plus ones. It's not a wedding or a party where it actually is a case of the more the merrier. Often, guest lists are based on how many chairs you own and how big your dining room is. Trying to last minute include yourself is beyond rude - but you know that.

Inviting yourself is also not okay.", "Yeah, I was pretty gobsmacked at that, but not totally surprised coming from Grant.

People who are comfortable ignoring your (or others') boundaries will keep bull-dozing through them until you TEACH them not to, by holding firm.\n2.

Be thankful for each of those other friends who pointed out how boundary stomping Grant, Alex, and Hannah were and those who are telling you that your were fine upholding your boundaries.\n4. It is perfectly fine to not be a \"more-the-merrier\" person (just as it's fine to be an m-t-m person). And you don't even have to hold the same stance every time. You can have your general preference, but and m-t-m person can have a special occasion where they want only and exactly who they invited (and vice-versa). Guests should never assume. Even if you were generally an m-t-m person, Alex needed to ASK you in private and RESPECT your answer, period. Given that you have tried to set that boundary in the past, Alex should have told Grant, \"*No, you don't get to just invite yourself to someone's home, buddy. Maybe some other time.*\"\n5. After Alex asked you, he definitely needed to make Grant understand that he CANNOT impose on you like that. And Hannah(!), when she's hosting she can have anyone crash her party. She cannot push on behalf of a would-be gate-crasher. She needs to learn some manners, too!\n6. If Hannah wants to judge you for not being an m-t-m person, that's her problem, not yours. There's nothing right or wrong about your preference. Personally, I judge her for trying to enable a cluelessly rude gate-crasher, instead of respecting your boundaries.", "NTA.
