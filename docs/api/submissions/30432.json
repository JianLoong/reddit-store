Based on how you\u2019ve described her, this isn\u2019t the first time and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. \n\nMove out, don\u2019t give her any money, and she\u2019ll probably deny that she never implied to move out of you aren\u2019t happy with her rules of supporting her.", "NTA I have a family friend who\u2019s mom was extremely similar and owes them 1,000$+ because they were manipulated into supporting their family when their family should have been supporting them. They moved out and are LC or possibly NC with their family better too nip this in the bud now then face this emotional abuse who knows maybe mom will learn she can\u2019t treat you this way and your relationship will get better", "NTA  \nI'm so sorry for your circumstances and your mother failing you and being so toxic.   \nI'm also so sorry to say, it is probably best for you to get away from her.   \nDon't feel guilty. It is her responsibility to provide for YOU. SHE failed. Not you.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations, you just detonated a narcissistic wound, which was having to lend money from her daughter and then being caught lying about being tight and hence unable to pay back. \n\nNarcissists will tend to explode like a nuke at the first smidge of shame they feel. Being unable to lie their way out of things usually makes them go ballistic. \n\nUnfortunately, it's rarely something that can change. And your best bet is unfortunately to just get away from her and to try to be the exact opposite of how she is.", "NTA when I was sixteen that would have been a fuck load of money for me. Ultimately just sad :/ but you\u2019re obviously a great person  and if she doesn\u2019t pay I can imagine it getting very salty in that household.", "NTA, Hey, I totally get how much this whole situation must've messed you up. You're not the asshole in this mess; your mom breaking her word is not cool. She might be your mom, but she can't just ask for money without following through on her promise to pay you back. It's messed up that she's backing you into a corner, both emotionally and physically, and that's not okay. I can't imagine how tough it is for you dealing with all this drama, especially given her behavior.Girl, that decision to move out might feel like the only way to handle things right now. It sounds like this situation's been eating at you for a while, and it's just too much. But hold up, maybe take a breather before making any drastic moves. Think it over, talk to someone you trust about what's going down, and try to figure out your next steps. Moving out is a big deal, and it's important to weigh everything before you make the move.

I\u2019m glad you have somewhere to go to remove yourself from the abusive situation.", "NTA and Get out if you can. This is coming from experience with dealing with a mother just like yours except my mom\u2019s vices are uppers and pills. It will only escalate and get worse from this point and you will be put in a position where you are pinned and can\u2019t leave.", "NTA, seems less about the money and more about your mom's unhinged reaction. It doesn't sound like a stable place to live and you certainly shouldn't be picking up future bills. If you've got a better place to stay I'd consider it.", "NTA but get everything together before moving. make a plan. and dont let her access your account", "NTA- I wish I could have.  I have a similar parent and I swear I was the homes emergency fund.\n\nThere was a year where within the same week she called the grocery list I made \"a wish list\"\nsaying money nwas tight.\n\nThen asked me for $10 for a bottle of \"holiday cheer\"\n\nYes it was Christmas week.  Yes I did end up giving the money.  I did call her on it first, got blown up at then later gave the money.

If you're in America, she might be able to use police to make you go home because you are a minor.  \n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this. You do not deserve to be treated that way.  The way she is treating you is wrong.  Don't doubt that. Don't second guess yourself.", "NTA\n\nHoney.. this reminds me far too much of me when I was younger. This is abuse. You are young and you don't deserve any of this treatment. She is supposed to care for you. And you need to prioritize yourself.\n\nI have a few questions for you to think about, ok? If you move out, do you have people who will support you, and do you have a safe place to go? Those are really important to keep in mind. Get those sorted before you go. Please be safe.\n\nAnd you don't need to talk to her about your plans. Grey rocking might help? Might not but it's worth mentioning here.", "NTA \nBut a grammar tip:\nShe asked you to loan her the money \n\nYou lent it to her\n\nShe will not pay back what you loaned\n\nYou will never lend money to her again \n\nActually any time she asks for money again you can just send her those four lines.", "I'd say NTA since that doesn't sound like a particularly safe place, and she's escalating and trying to turn her child into a meal ticket...but please be safe in leaving, and I've been told it can sometimes take multiple attempts to fully leave domestic situations like this, so don't give up if you need to try more than once.", "Honestly, NTA.  \n\nIF you stay, this will be a long, steep slide into a circle of hell.  You do yourself NO favours staying and every favour leaving.  Especially since you've been thinking about that very thing for a while."]}
