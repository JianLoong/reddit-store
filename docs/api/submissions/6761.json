Absolutely the f*ck not. I wouldn\u2019t send her a dime. The 6 of them can figure it out. This sounds super toxic. I\u2019d stay low contact with your family.

What they want is to drain your wallet instead, and then pat themselves on the back for helping.", "NTA, she actually wished you and your son ill and she has no remorse. Unless she apologizes and finds fault in her actions, she\u2019s not entitled to your son\u2019s things. She shouldn\u2019t benefit from the very child she didn\u2019t want to survive.

You could consider estranging yourself, but you can't look back. Family members will suck you dry until you can't enjoy any of  your life.

I don't know you, but my heart hurts for you.    When people are cruel and abusive, you owe them nothing!", "NTA at all. Your family sounds toxic and ruled by their religion. They cannot pick and choose when they want to acknowledge your existence, and it seems like the only reach out when they need something. \n\nWhat F37 said to you was disgusting, her fertility issues are not your problem, it sounds like she needs therapy to help cope with her grief. \n\nI\u2019m so glad your baby made a fully recovery!", "NTA\n\nYou were a little harsh, but after what you\u2019ve been through that\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s a two way street. She didn\u2019t help you and said some really vile things to you, so why do you need to help her when you have your own family to look after? It\u2019d be nice if you gave her some things you didn\u2019t need anymore, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re required to do so.\n\nHope everything is going well with your family and that you have some positive people in your life to balance things out.", "NTA. \n\nYou don't need to help someone who's been an asshole towards you, even if it's family. There's simply no obligation. Had she been a decent sister, you'd most likely have helped her. \n\nAlso, your sister tried becoming pregnant for years but was not prepared financially for a baby?

Yes, they sound like they resented you and treated you badly as adults, but you do have to agree that you seem to have been your parents' favorite daughter in their treatment of you vs. them. Your parents could have apologized to them and stopped some of their anger going toward you. \n\nAs for F37, she did make her own bed. But you still could have given a few things your child has outgrown/ that you no longer need. That wouldn't have hurt.
