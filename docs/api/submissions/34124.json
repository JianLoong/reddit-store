However, I\u2019ve used it regularly and plan to use it even more often because of a change in my work/schedule this year.\n\nMy partner wants to take the desk to use for their work. They work 6 hours per day and have said the desk will allow them to be more comfortable because of the ability to adjust the height on the fly. They feel that because they will use the desk more often, I should let them take it. \n\nI\u2019m having a hard time giving up the desk because it was a birthday gift. And, although I haven\u2019t used it daily, I use it regularly and it will soon become an integral part of getting my cardio during the work day on a more consistent basis.\n\nWhen the desk was purchased about a year ago, I was the breadwinner, and my partner was self-employed. Now, my partner and I are both self-employed and my partner is currently our more consistent source of income.\n\nI have suggested purchasing another desk. As the need for this desk seems immediate, my partner would need to make this purchase. Otherwise, I\u2019d be able to make the purchase for my partner whenever I have that opportunity. \n\nMy partner is offended that I do not want to let them take the desk. They are also offended that I have suggested they purchase another desk, or continue working with their current setup until I can purchase another desk. \n\nI am offended that my partner wants to take the desk they gave me as a birthday gift.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I choose to keep the desk in my office and not let my partner take it?", "created_utc": 1704174966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wi57x/wibta_if_i_dont_decide_to_let_my_partner_use_take/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's pretty rotten to insist on taking back a gift just because they want to use it more often than you do. Could the two of you save to get a second one?", "Nah, OP should keep the desk. Even if their partner thinks they don't use it \"enough\". That's irrelevant. It's not their desk and belittling OP to try and take away it is offensive. \n\nThe partner can save up and buy another one, it doesn't sound like an urgent need, just an \"I want, give me\" selfish demand.  I've had my dh decide he needed my things more than I did - he has \"borrowed\" a lot of my brand new electronics/computer equip and either broke it or it disappeared.
