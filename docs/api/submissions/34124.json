Yes, I\u2019m sure that we can save to buy a second desk. But, I think the need for the desk is more immediate for my partner. So, if the decision is made to acquire a second desk, they would make the purchases themselves.", "Ok. Thank you for the extra info. Good luck!", "Is your partner usually what\u2019s mine is mine, and what\u2019s yours is mine?\n\nThis is your desk and you use it . Nta", "Why would you purchase a desk for them? Your desk was a gift. It doesn\u2019t matter how often you are using it. Your partner can purchase their own desk and you are NTA", "NTA\n\nUnless you're accidentally seriously misrepresenting how long ago this gift was given and how rarely you use/plan to use it this just isn't a \"spare\" desk that no one is using. If your partner wants one then you all can plan to buy another, but this one was a present and is not totally unused. And it isn't  really the sort of item that you can easily move back and forth to share", "NTA. It's your property and now appears your partner gave it to you all the while planning to reclaim it. It's irrelevant who's the breadwinner or whether you use it daily, It's your property and partner needs to get their own.", "Info:\n\nAre all things divided by a mutual agreement of who uese the thing more?\n\nWho decides whose use of a thing trumps the other?\n\nIf this method of claiming things is agreed upon by both of you, then fine. If not, and especially if it only applies to your things, then you have a partner problem.", "NTA. To be honest, it feels a little like your partner thought you wouldn\u2019t use it at all and bought it so that THEY could have it.", "Going against the grain here and saying NAH. \nPartner needs a desk - you have two, which by your own words one which you\u2019re not really using much (you say you will but intentions don\u2019t always pan out). It makes sense to use what you have rather than make an additional purchase. \nI suspect this is written much in your favour. If you share a house surely you can share what\u2019s in it. Can you not lend the desk til they can get one of their own as a compromise? \nAlso if you\u2019re on camera in meetings DONT use the treadmill. It\u2019s annoying as f*ck to others.", "ESH \n\nBe honest, in the year you have had the desk how often do you actually use it? \n\n\nWhen is your partner's birthday? Why not buy her a desk as an early birthday present", "NTA. Tell them to get their own damn desk!", "NTA. And it's very, very important not to sit all day - the human body is not made for this, and humans have never sat for as long as they do now. It is a need and you do need two desks. He can also write it off as a business expense", "NTA. \n\nThis feels like Homer\u2019s bowling ball in the Simpsons. Are you sure he didn\u2019t gift it to you with the intention of taking it all along?", "Get it in writing that you are temporarily lending them the desk,  and that it will be replaced at their cost with a new one for you if not returned in same condition by March 30th.", "NTA it's your birthday gift, you should be the one to decide. He needs to get over it and buy himself one.", "So everybody is offended, got it.", "Definitely NTA Last time I checked you don't take back gifts? You can borrow it sometimes but you don't get to keep it as yours. What the person does with it is entirely their business. you shouldn't have to buy another one just so you can keep what was gifted to you. It is a shitty behavior that toddlers have. All I can think of is a toddler feeding you a piece of their food and getting angry that you can't bring it out of your tummy.", "Next time don't buy a gift for yourself for your girlfriend, goofball. NTA", "Qp", "Ask him if he's sure he wants to return the gifts from last year. If he persists, take back the one you gave him and inform him that all gifts going forward need to be on a permanent basis or not at all. I don't like this for you, OP. NtA.", "NTA. What kind of selfish jerk buys their partner a Birthday gift and then asks that the gift be given to them?", "Wtf. That's your desk. How is this even a question. Partner needs to get his own desk. NTA, duh.", "Nta", "My wife buys me things I need/want all of the time I rarely get to use it before she dies\ud83e\udd37", "Thanks for your reply.\n\nNo, my partner isn\u2019t necessarily of the \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine, what\u2019s yours is yours\u201d mindset. I\u2019m probably more along those lines in some ways. My partner is very resourceful and often repurpose things that I\u2019d otherwise toss. \n\nI\u2019ve given my partner some of my electronics, (some that I was actively using) for them to use for their work before, but these were not gifts. \n\nI think my partner wanting to use the desk is mainly because I don\u2019t use it as often as they\u2019d use it.", "Thank you for your reply.\n\nI understand your response. If I were to purchase the desk, it would be to resolve my partner\u2019s problem, which is the same reason they purchased the desk for me. It wouldn\u2019t be out of any obligation or guilt, just love :)", "Thanks for your reply.\n\nThere\u2019s no agreement of the type. I think it\u2019s more of a \u201creturn on investment/value\u201d perspective. \n\nTo be concise: My partner sees the desk as being a solution to their problem, and since I\u2019m not using it as often as it would be used to resolve their problem, then I should just let them use it.", "I think it would only be NAH if the partner was asking nicely to borrow it for a little while, until they can organise their own desk. \n\nBut instead they are basically demanding that they get their own way, because THEY have decided that they will make better use of OP\u2019s birthday present than she will. \n\nAn opinion that she doesn\u2019t agree with by the way - she is pretty clear that she doesn\u2019t expect to get it back once he \u201cborrows\u201d it (from the original post stating that she\u2019ll be back to using it a lot when her work scope changes in a while). \n\nAnd also in one of her comments she says that he frequently takes her electronic items *that she does regularly use* if he decides he wants to use them now. \n\nThe partner does sound like an AH when it comes to sharing things, unfortunately - and for whatever reason OP thinks this is normal. Hopefully she\u2019s discovering from the replies on here that it\u2019s not how healthy (non-AH) partners behave, and starts expecting better behaviour from him.", "What need?????? There is no NEED here. Your partner WANTS the desk that they bought you FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY. I am actually a bit suspicious that he only bought it for himself, and just waited until he had the leverage to get it. \n\nBuy another one. Keep your birthday present. The big baby will get over it.", "If they REALLY need the desk that soon, you could always tell them to buy you a new, better one, and they can have the old one.", "As there seems to be a lot of assumptions here would you be willing to share your genders? And what your partners current work set up is vs yours?", "I would maybe suggest letting him use it temporarily and getting him to sell his current one to help fund his own new one that perfectly suits his needs.  That's if it's necessary for example; his current one is causing pain or medical issues. That's if you want to, you don't have to do anything at the end of the day. It's just a compromise if you want it.", "I'm pretty sure \"before she dies\" is a typo, but imagining it is not: that got dark very fast xD", "Taking electronics you were actually using for their work is actually spot on with \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine, what\u2019s yours is also mine.\u201d This seems like a pattern from your partner.", "It would be out of being manipulated", "At no point did I see genders mentioned, did I miss that? Or are assumptions being made that op is female and partner male? \nAlso op didn\u2019t use the word \u2018demand\u2019 at all. \nA lot of the comments seem to be making assumptions. \nFor all we know the partner is working at the kitchen table - as that\u2019s context that hasn\u2019t been given", "It always sucks when someone actually uses the gift you secretly bought for yourself :(", "Partner (current main bread winner - gender unspecified) work set up had not been explained, they might be working at a coffee table in a shared space while op (no longer main bread winner) occupies a study with two desks and one fitness set up. \nI feel like op needs to provide a lot more context than what they have.", "It won\u2019t be temporary. If he\u2019s enough of an AH to not understand why she doesn\u2019t want him to take back her birthday present after less than a year, he\u2019s not going to return it when she wants it back.", "Lol, it's 5:57 am I've eaten once, and chemo is kick'n muh butt this week.\n\nThat should have read does*.\nThank you\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udcaa\u270c", "Oh! I apologize as I misread your original message as \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine, what\u2019s yours is yours\u201d.\n\nYes, my partner does have the tendency to have the \u201cwhat\u2019s yours is mine\u201d mindset. But, they do also offer to share their things with me.", "I figured that, but it was so unexpected I had to smile.\nGood luck and all the best wishes for you! Kick cancers butt <3", "Do they share with you or does their stuff become effectively yours with you being the only user? Because that\u2019s what they\u2019re asking of you with the desk and what has previously happened with the electronics you were using and gave them.\n\nIf they\u2019re just sharing stuff they don\u2019t use it isn\u2019t the same thing either."]}
