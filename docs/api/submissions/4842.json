I can\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t want to tell your husband, you were put in an awkward situation where telling him would cause arguments and tension in the family.", "You're NTA but maybe you and your husband should talk about this, and you should tell BIL to buzz off.", "NTA\n\nBut understand that just because *you* don't care that it is being said doesn't mean your husband doesn't have a reason to be upset/hurt by the comments.  After all, BIL is talking negatively about your husband behind his back.  You're NTA, but I understand why your husband is upset that you didn't tell him.  If someone was saying that behind my back, I'd want to know.  And I'd be upset at my spouse if they knew someone was saying that and didn't inform me so I could put a stop to it.", "While it may not be a big deal to you, it certainly sounds like it is to your husband. I highly recommend sitting down and clearing the air about this before it exacerbates into something beyond volatile. Sure, you're a part of the equation, but your BiL is the biggest instigator of this.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but I suspect your husband is upset because he thought you didn't trust him to defend you.  I'd be ripping body parts off someone who said something like that to my spouse.  You are wise not to have put any value on what your AH BIL was saying, but when your husband calms down, just try to explain to him that you didn't say anything because noise from a blowhard is just noise unless you pay attention.", "Just tell him you never told him because you didn\u2019t believe it and it didn\u2019t matter. NTA", "What you need to be worried about is what your BIL is telling other people who are in the family business,  which is what I think your husband has a serious problem with...and,  frankly,  he should.\n\nThis man is probably badmouthing you to each and every single person he knows in the company.\n\nYour husband stood up to him to protect you and he was angry that you took his brother's abuse...probably because he thinks that you didn't trust him to take your side.\n\nYTA...to yourself. \n\nedit:  INFO:  does your BIL tend to be a toxic asshole?", "ESH. I feel like if my partners brother told me those kinds of things, I would bring it up at least once with her, especially if said family member is so cordial to her otherwise. That's also a shitty thing to say so he's an asshole. And you going \"yeah maybe that's true but it doesn't matter\" is not helping the situation bc you're implying to your husband that you're only together for convenience and you don't actually feel anything for him. And if that's true, why are you still together?", "Not sure why there's any scenario here where you would find yourself being an AH. There's only 1 AH here, and it's your BiL. I do think you probably should have stood up for yourself the first or second time it happened so this could have been nipped before it got to that point.", "You're NTA here.\n\nHis brother is absolutely a jealous petty and vindictive AH who apparently has nothing better than to attack your husband and stir drama.\n\nHe should not be allowed at your home", "NTA. BIL is aiming at you not hubby. You handled it appropriately by not giving his slurs any oxygen. You chose not to let BIL infiltrate your marriage. When hubby found out, he did stand up for you and your family unit. Hubby's anger at you is misplaced. Talk with hubby just don't say he shouldn't be mad. That derails conversation. Good luck.", "NTA. Your husband can get upset if he wants, but if you don't care what his brother says there was no reason to go crying to him about it. The brother is responsible for the reaction, not you for not sharing that he insulted you.", "Soft YTA.  You, yourself may no longer have a problem because you've become desensitized to it by now. But it's very clear your husband does, infact have a problem with it. You really should have told him when it started.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA I guess, but if my family was saying stuff like that to my partner, I would want to know. And be hurt that they didn\u2019t feel like they could tell me.", "You are NTA but wow did you not talking to your husband come back to bite you. Honestly it sounds like the way he found out (and you laughing it off) probably makes him think it\u2019s true. NTA but communication is key.", "Great brother in law. King AH.", "NTA. \n\nBut your BIL wants to break you up for some reason. He's the AH.    \n\nYou need to tell your husband these things.", "I'm actually going soft YTA here, if your husband feels that his brother was lying about him, then he kind of had the right to know.\n\nIf the brother was lying about \\*you\\* then sure, you don't have tell people if you don't want to, but as the lies were about your husband, I think your husband actually deserved a heads up.", "Nta for not wanting to cause a fight between him and his brother but a slight yta towards your husband especially with his reaction. He probably feels hurt that you didn't come to him and seeing how his brother has said it on multiple occasions to you and your husband couldn't protect you from his verbal abuse. I'm pretty sure had you of said something the first time that would have been the last time he said it. But I do applaud you for trying to come to your bully's rescue because you didn't want them fighting. You should really talk to your husband and let him know your reasoning for not telling him.", "Yta", "100% agree with this \ud83d\udc46!\n\nOP You Are NTA! You and your husband need to sit. Down and talk this out.  Apologize to him for not trusting him and coming to him when your brother-in-law first started this. Then explain to him that you felt caught in a very difficult place. And why you felt that way. Ask him to understand and to forgive you.  Then maybe the two of you can talk about why his brother-in-law most likely feels that way he does and keep saying the things that he has been saying. Does the man not like you? Does the man think his brother settled for you rather than seek something that might have been greater? Is the man jealous because his brother is married to a long time sweetheart? Or is the guy just a jerk?", "NTA, but this is his brother. That\u2019s something you have to consider, they have a dynamic that you aren\u2019t involved in, and you have to respect that. Your husband just feels very disrespected by this and probably just wanted to know sooner since it\u2019s his brother. Although, I am not blaming you, nothing you did was wrong and the only AH here is the BIL. Try and have a sit down with your husband and work things out <3", "NAH (except BIL)\n\nYou didn't tell your husband because you didn't want to come between them. Okay yep I get that. I've kept my mouth shut over things for the same reason with friends and family. But your husband is allowed to be upset because he feels like you were hiding important information. I see both sides. Once he's calmed down a bit, it's time to have to long talk about it", "NAH.\n\nYou married your husband because you were pregnant; I don't see anything about love.\n\nHe speaks the truth and you don't seem to care so I don't see what the big deal is.", "NTA, but you need to tell him. You also need to tell BIL to STFU and leave you alone. Tell your husband because I can see a future event where you DO try to tell him and he won\u2019t believe you because BIL poisons his mind.", "This isn't the sort if thing you keep from your spouse to \"keep the peace\". These comments are horribly disrespectful to both of them. Husband should have had this info all along so he could decide what kind of relationship he wants to have with his brother.\n\nOP was put in a difficult position but she absolutely made the wrong choice.", "First off NTA.  But is The reason you never told your husband is because you were afraid it might be true?(Lovingly asking)", "YTA. It sounds as if your BIL was quite right - you got married to someone you had broken up with because you were pregnant and your FIL was worried about his son.", "Not his place though. Not his monkeys, not his circus.", "Maybe he doesn't like seeing his brother in a loveless marriage of convenience?", "Again. The decision was his brother's who is an adult. He has nothing to like or not like. The brother didn't ask for his input, neither OP asked.", "Meanwhile, in normal families siblings care about each other."]}
