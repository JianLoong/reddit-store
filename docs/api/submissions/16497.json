She lives with my husband and I and our 2 children. Monday evening, she became lethargic and confused. She didn't know where she was or what was happening. We called 911 and she was taken to the hospital where she was admitted into the ICU with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia. Her thyroid levels were 10 times what the normal level is. She was awake and responsive when she was admitted but, overnight, she stopped breathing and they had to intubate her. She has been in a medically induced coma ever since.\n\nMy sister (45F) is 2 hours away and I have been the point of contact for everything. My sister let my mom's 4 sisters know what was going on and they came to see her because we weren't sure if she was going to make it. One of them gave her number to the staff and I approved it for them to give her updates if she called. However, I woke up Wednesday morning to my mother's private medical information posted to Facebook. There was information that I didn't even know yet because I hadn't spoken to her doctor yet that day. I was very upset. Then, yesterday morning, my aunt posted that my mother was doing so great and everything was good. That wasn't true. So, my sister and I decided to ask the hospital not to update anybody but the two of us.\n\nMy aunt called this morning and was told she was stable but they couldn't share any other information and she would have to talk to me if she wanted to know more. Now, my aunts have decided that I am the villian here and they are after my head. My sister has been running interference for me so I don't have to directly deal with them but my aunt called me anyway. She demanded to know why she wasn't allowed to have information and accused me of ruining my other aunt's vacation. She also told me not to bother updating them. Then she called the hospital and tried to manipulate the nurse into giving her information. We had to put a password on my mom's chart.\n\nMy mom isn't close with her sisters. She always complained that they never told her anything and always left her out of everything. She hasn't seen or spoken to them in years. I feel comfortable saying that she would understand my sister and I's stance right now. Her sisters are all in their mid to late 60s and they want to be in control but they aren't her next of kin. I don't want to step on their toes but I also don't want my mom's medical information spread all over social media. They accused me of icing them out, which I tried to explain that I am not doing. I will still let them know what is happening with their sister.

Sharing the private medical info of someone in critical care on facebook in messed up, and calling visiting your in critical care sister a vacation says a lot about their relationship.", "NTA. Posting your mom's medical information on Facebook was an invasion of your mom's privacy just as surely as if your aunt had posted a nude photo of your mom.

It's really disruptive to providing care. We often ask families to have one dedicated person to disseminate info. I'd bet the nurses would be on board to approach it like that.

They really have no right to know your mom's medical status. They blew it when they posted about it on Facebook. You did the right thing.", "NTA.\nAt minimum a person's private mediacal info should be just that - private. When mom was conscious, did she ever put into force a medical directive or springing medical trust? Without a explicitly signed document from mom to a legal representative saying you can manage her info, mom's sisters may give you a valid battle.\n\nFirst, you need to capture proof of your sharing her info with her family in good faith.  Second, you need to capture proof that they shared mom's private medicaid info.  Finally, you need to show proof that you reprimanded them to justify cutting off their access.  This will establish a timeline of activity reinforcing your actions should this go to court.", "NTA. You can tell them her condition in vague terms without details. The big question is whether you have medical power of attorney, or whatever the term in your jurisdiction for being legally designated to make medical decisions. If not, shame on all of you, including your mother, for not having her put that in writing.\n\nFrom your description, i am guessing she has thyroid deficiency, not thyroid excess, though severe degrees of either can land an old person in the ICU. There would have been so many warning signs of trouble from excess thyroid hormone (weight loss, rapid heart rate, sleeplessness, high temperature) that i would consider anyone who lived with that person somewhat negligent not to have realized they were getting into trouble. Severe hypothyroidism on the other hand is far easier to overlook, with just a general slowing of everything, including the person's ability to handle their own medical care, and then very low body temperature and respiratory failure when it gets advanced enough.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nBut you are for allowing them that info in the first place when your mom hasn\u2019t spoken to them in years", "That's an excellent idea.", "I agree.

Neither one of us are very happy to find out what's happening with our mother from a Facebook post before we've even had a chance to talk to her doctor. I guess I can't understand why they're upset when they're still getting the same information just from a different source. Nobody's cutting them out of what's going on.", "Oh I understand.

I don't know them well enough to have predicted this. They aren't close with my mother. Therefore, I am also not close with them.

Sorry about your mom :(.\n\nRelated but might give you a laugh: my husband ended up in hospital out of state while traveling. He's fine now! But at the time he gave them my name and number as his wife. I called his mom and told her everything (which I knew he wouldn't mind and would tell her eventually anyhow, plus she was close to where he was). I called his dad (who hates me, but still left a voice mail and texted hospital and phone number there). I honestly didn't know if they'd tell him anything other than husband was stable. Well dad calls mom (they're like 40 years divorced, but mostly ok with each other) and he's pissed because the hospital didn't call him. She told him I'm the next of kin as wife, plus husband had lost his phone and the only number he knew was mine, and even if he had his phone they couldn't open it and wouldn't know who dad was cause it wasn't saved that way... so how the f was the hospital supposed to contact him? Cause even if they got his name and location... he only had a cell phone, so it's not like they could look him up. Bless my MIL she's awesome. I just wished she didn't live so far away!\n\nAnother bit, when my dad went from \"I'd like some coke\" one night to dying the next day, I'm the one who got the call \"do you want us to make him comfortable or take measures\"... I'm like \"well my mom would be next of kin but he has a DNR and a living will we can bring to the hospital if needed\" then they asked \"Is that what your mom would say\". Being all upset about the whole thing I just said yea, we've all talked about this. My MIL said you can assign one person for normal \"I'm sick notify them\" and another for the \"they're dying\". She lost both her parents and a sister, and was responsible for all the things so I don't doubt her. Especially seeing as how they called me for the dying bit, but they'd already called my mom he was sick, so she called me. But it was me they called and asked if that's what my mom would want. That's when I was like \"wait, she's next of kin...\" but they just kinda glossed over that. And I was upset enough to not really catch on til later", "NTA. Family sucks. You are her caretaker and those who aren\u2019t doing just have to bow to your wishes.", "NTA\n\nTell them you *are* icing them out and that\u2019s what happens when you spread peoples private medical information.  Privileges revoked!", "NTA...... Step on all the toes! They have no right to your mother's medical information. Especially not posting it all over Facebook for complete strangers to see. I would report those posts to see if you can get them taken down. You have enough to deal with. I honestly wouldn't give them any overly detailed information about your mother's health. They will just post it all over. Give them the bare minimum.", "Agreed. We never posted even one thing about my father's health during his battle with cancee. The people who needed to know were told directly by myself or my brother. The only thing we posted on Facebook was the announcement of his passing after the people closest to him were told over the phone. Facebook was to let the distant relatives know.", "Dealt with just as much loss as you missy, and my fair share of pushy/annoying people. It\u2019s family they\u2019d be more understanding hearing it from you instead of some hospital staff over the phone.\n\nIt\u2019s basic human psychology, and the actions of OP come off cold and rude.
