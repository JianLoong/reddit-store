Two of them asked me this morning if I wanted to join them in a prayer for the people inside (they know I am the only other church goer in the office) and I respectfully declined. \n\nWhen I declined, my coworker, let\u2019s call her Kathy, was flabbergasted and said that it was unbecoming of a Christian to withhold prayer for anyone. (Kathy is a single older woman who is very sensitive and always causing drama or complaining about her failed marriage that ended before I got to the company 6 years ago) This upset me, as she is one of those phony Christians who thinks because she goes to church once a month she can be a terrible person to everyone and be forgiven. \n\nI told Kathy that while I feel sympathy for the families, I do not feel any sympathy for someone who puts themselves in this position. I do not think the rescue effort is worth the massive amount of money being spent on it, and I think that if the passengers didn\u2019t include a billionaire none of us would have heard more than a 2 minute clip on the news about this. \n\nKathy called me an ass with tears in her eyes and went home for the day. Of course, nobody heard the discourse just her yelling at me and storming out. Now everyone in my office is telling me to apologize and they said I was being a dick about it. The coworker with Kathy when she asked me has been gossiping about me all day, even the guy who runs the cafe in our building heard about it somehow. \n\nI dont know why people care so much about this submarine. Maybe that\u2019s insensitive, okay, but I don\u2019t think it warrants this type of response.\n\nAITA?

Wow what a toxic workplace. First of all, it is super inappropriate to be holding prayer groups at work. Thats what church is for. Secondly, your decision to pray or not pray is your own.
