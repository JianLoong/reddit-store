The news is constantly playing on the tvs in their offices, it\u2019s what they\u2019re talking about all. Day. Long. Two of them asked me this morning if I wanted to join them in a prayer for the people inside (they know I am the only other church goer in the office) and I respectfully declined. \n\nWhen I declined, my coworker, let\u2019s call her Kathy, was flabbergasted and said that it was unbecoming of a Christian to withhold prayer for anyone. (Kathy is a single older woman who is very sensitive and always causing drama or complaining about her failed marriage that ended before I got to the company 6 years ago) This upset me, as she is one of those phony Christians who thinks because she goes to church once a month she can be a terrible person to everyone and be forgiven. \n\nI told Kathy that while I feel sympathy for the families, I do not feel any sympathy for someone who puts themselves in this position. I do not think the rescue effort is worth the massive amount of money being spent on it, and I think that if the passengers didn\u2019t include a billionaire none of us would have heard more than a 2 minute clip on the news about this. \n\nKathy called me an ass with tears in her eyes and went home for the day. Of course, nobody heard the discourse just her yelling at me and storming out. Now everyone in my office is telling me to apologize and they said I was being a dick about it. The coworker with Kathy when she asked me has been gossiping about me all day, even the guy who runs the cafe in our building heard about it somehow. \n\nI dont know why people care so much about this submarine. Maybe that\u2019s insensitive, okay, but I don\u2019t think it warrants this type of response.\n\nAITA?

Or Kathy and the other coworker will twist things and claim that YOU were attacking THEM for their religious practices.  Either way, I think it's wise to get on top of it before it gets out of hand.\n\nAlso, in the future, it's probably wise not to go into detail about your feelings regarding things like this at work, particularly when your opinions are unpopular amongst your colleagues.  Simply stating, \"I prefer to keep my religion out of the workplace and my prayers between me and god,\" is probably more effective.", ">Kathy called me an ass with tears in her eyes and went home for the day.\n\nKathy sounds like a person who goes out of her way to not work, while getting paid to do so.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. she wanted to performatively pray for these people to look good, and you're spot on in your comment that there's only so much visibility and talk about this because they're billionaires. set the record straight with your other coworkers. you don't have to pray for anyone, and you don't need a reason.", "NTA. Wow what a toxic workplace. First of all, it is super inappropriate to be holding prayer groups at work. Thats what church is for. Secondly, your decision to pray or not pray is your own. I cant recall the exact part of the bible right now but maybe remind your coworker of the story where Jesus clearly says those who pray on street corners for everyone to see are less authentic than those who pray privately and quietly. \n\nThirdly, wtf is anyone else in the office getting involved?? Do you have a HR department? I would be logging this just in case anyone came after me. This all sounds super inappropriate for a professionsl workspace. \n\nBtw, i assume your \"Christian\" coworker also wanted to pray for the most recent migrant boat tragedy where multiple vulnerable people died, right after she was done praying for the billionaire who got into an unsafe submarine controlled by a ps controller to go visit a mass grave.", "NTA. People need to accept that others may have different views and that they should not ask a question if they are not ready for the answer", "NTA.\n\nThis group prayer at work seems performative. Tell her your prayers are between you + your God and to kindly mind her own business.", "NTA- she can just mind her business. Also at work? that crosses a bit of a line honestly professionally. She's the one who yelled at you, when you just stated your opinion.", "NTA, they are. How do they know you haven't been praying. I'm gonna pray you find a better job with better co-workers. Do not apologize to them. They should be apologizing to you.", "NTA Religion forced on other people is never correct. Who you decide to pray for is only your prerogative.\n\nAlso the submersible was found, imploded. They have been dead for days.", "NTA - i hate to say this......but......surprise.....her prayers did not work.  too harsh?", "NTA \n\n1) Outside of employment by a religious institution, personal religion and work shouldn't really mix.  If you get any further grief about this, talk to HR.\n\n2) In the future, something like \"Thanks for asking, but I keep my prayer life private\" should be sufficient to deter such people.  (If necessary, quote Matthew 6:8 - \"But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\")  If they keep trying, see #1 above and talk to HR.", "NTA because you shouldn't be pressured into prayer with anyone let alone in the workplace. but your views don't sound very Christian to me. sounds like you have a deeper beef about all the attention this is getting and took it out on your coworker who had good intentions.", "NTA, go to HR", "ESH\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t force you to pray but the comments you made about those who lost their lives are pretty insensitive especially in a workplace environment.", "You aren't an asshole, you just lack the social acuity to navigate your way through that office and pick up on others' social cues.", "Ouch. \n\nSo...you're not an *AH* for not wanting to pray with them but your entire post seems very not Christian.", "There are so many layers here. \n\nI\u2019ll preface by saying that I\u2019m an atheist so any coworker asking me to pray for any reason would make me very uncomfortable and I wouldn\u2019t do it, so obviously NTA simply for not gathering in prayer at the workplace. \n\nAlso, NTA for believing it\u2019s a waste of resources to send rescue crews on a dangerous and likely fruitless mission. That\u2019s a valid opinion, whether I or others share it. \n\nBut as someone who calls themself a Christian, YTA for deciding who you think is worthy of prayer and who isn\u2019t. That\u2019s not your call. You are not god and Christian teaching should tell you that anyone in harms way is deserving of prayer. There\u2019s always an appropriate prayer when tragedy strikes (if you are the praying type) even if the prayer is for the comfort of their family members. By you deciding who is/is not worthy of prayer, you are being a CINO. Christian In Name Only.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
