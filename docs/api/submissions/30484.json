It's unfortunate that your MIL and SIL reacted defensively, but it's crucial to stand by your decision to protect your daughter's boundaries, as it's fundamental to her sense of agency and self-identity. Your mother-in-law overstepped, and maintaining those boundaries is essential. Continue to support your daughter and ensure she feels heard and respected. This situation is about protecting your daughter's autonomy and not about preventing a relationship between her and her grandmother, but it's essential that it happens with respect for Vihana's wishes.", "NTA but I would be calling the police as well.", "NTA\nDon't let them near your daughter ever again.\nWho knows what they could do next.", "I mean, it might actually be a crime.

Your MIL's unauthorized actions didn't align with your daughter's desires, causing her a lot of distress. It seems essential for your MIL to understand and respect these boundaries for the well-being and comfort of your daughter. You and your husband seem to be taking the right steps by communicating and setting boundaries to ensure your daughter's comfort and autonomy are respected. Family dynamics can be tricky, but remember, what you're doing is ultimately for the welfare of your child, which should be the priority.

I know where your daughter is coming from because my Aunt did the same thing to me. She cut my waist length hair when I was 7. She didn\u2019t have my moms permission to do this she just didn\u2019t like that she had to put my hair in a braid at night , so she decided to give me and her daughter both a bowl cut and lie to my mom saying I wanted this cut also.

Seeing role models with varied appearances (hair types, styles, skin tones, physical abilities, sizes, facial features etc) that are celebrated will be crucial to making sure she doesn\u2019t internalize the idea that there\u2019s something \u201cwrong\u201d with any part of her that doesn\u2019t fit MIL\u2019s idea of what\u2019s best / appropriate / attractive.

She's NEVER been racist to me in the 25 years I've known her, never said an unkind word about my own hair, but now my husband and I are terrified over it every time they are alone with each other. And thanks to this post, I'm afraid she'll cut my daughter's hair without permission. Gonna have my husband talk to her first, get ahead of it.", "This wasn\u2019t the first time his wife acted this way, he\u2019s the one most likely to have seen the microagressions, heard the comments and heard her and Lucy be in accord on unpleasant views. That\u2019s why he\u2019s seriously thinking about divorce, this was the line that can\u2019t be come back from.", "And that her actions have potentially jeopardized his chances of seeing his granddaughter again too if he stays with the witch", "Yes. Grandfather should at least consider it & let his wife know. She needs to be held accountable. This is such a serious act of racism & violence against their grandkid. It's unacceptable.", "For me, It\u2019s the \u201cbecause clearly, you aren\u2019t gonna take care of her yourself\u201d comment that the SIL dropped. Maybe I\u2019m reading between the lines but it seems pretty much like \u201cYou\u2019re south Asian and we\u2019re white so we know best, and my mom needed to take care of your kid\u2019s uncivilized hair for you\u201d kind of racist comment.", "Yes my thoughts exactly. Seems racist. Poor babe. Aaah. Really feeling for her daughter.", "100%. as soon as i saw the title i thought 'racist white MIL and mixed race child'", "> They both seem racist to me. \n\nCouldn't possibly be more obvious.", "Also my first instinct.", "I had to scroll too far to read this.", "The child was obviously raised to be obedient to her parents at all costs.  I was raised similarly.  The poor child was then fed a lie that it was her mother's wishes to have her hair cut and straightened, so she complied.  That poor kid.\n\nETA: OP is definitely NTA", "It make feel good to see vengeance wreaked, but that doesn't mean it's what is best for the child.", "It's extremely unlikely she would see the inside of a cell. Police in situations like this usually just tell the family members that they need to sit down and work it out themselves, or they'll tell Grandma not to do it again. While it may (is) technically be a crime, it's almost certainly not going to go anywhere.\n\nI also disagree with putting it in the daughter's hands. She's having a hard time, she doesn't need to wrestle with that complicated and emotionally fraught decision. Take her to a stylist to manage the damage and make the best out of a bad thing until her hair grows out again, and surround her with love. Figure out ways to increase her assertiveness and autonomy, because it seems like she needs them.", "Fourteen year old me would have loved this too.", "Aren't 'well meaning' racist grandmothers just GREAT /s", "Ah yes, but did she say something to prevent her daughter mentioning her hair. Because she seemed to be devastated that he mother let her down, so maybe something was said to make her feel like she couldn't comment. Also, what kind of long term conditioning has been going on in the background to build to this.", "Coming from someone who was bullied and manipulated by their grandmother, who was the essence of evil, it's possible.", "You are right, as a child. But the daughter is 14. I went shopping on my own at 14. Maybe my mother would've told me \"go cut your hair, it's a mess\" (jokingly) but no way I would let my grandmother cut my hair just because my mother told me/her so.\nMaybe it's a cultural thing? But 14yo in my area are to independent, even though some might be really shy/introvert/ people pleasing.\n\nTbc, I am more concerned about what grandma may have told the daughter. Mother/daughter relationship seems good, as far as I could judge up to now.", "Absolutely. It's going to be hard coming out of it.", "Absolutely. Again, no one is considering the fact that if the MIL manipulated the child to get a hair cut, she would have also manipulated the child to not tell her mother about the problem.\n\nAlso, I don't think the mother's parenting style is the issue here, so this sounds like jumping to conclusions. Maybe knowing what the father was/was not aware of might help us understand better.", "I'm American, and if this happened to a kid of mine, there would be hell to pay.", "I honestly don't know why cos OP gave us this much.", "What if she was manipulated not to?\n\nOP also expressed shock at seeing the change only AFTER she came back home.", "Maybe she was too upset and/or she isn't in the habit of being snippy with her mother.", "I made the most ridiculous sound thinking about the kid running for grandma\n\nso cute", "Lying, Non consent, Doubling down, false outrage, Insults. Say bye MIL, SIL", "I don't even get the straight hair thing, white people have hair of all types the most common of which is actually probably wavy. It's east Asians that have predominantly straight hair. \n\nMIL and SIL are garbage. How could they do that to a child.", "I agree. \n\nBut as an adult the daughter would get to say 'remember when I sent you to prison grandma' every time this woman gives her any bs.", "Grandmother might've said not to mention the cut as it would be a \"surprise\" for mom. She sounds very manipulative and controlling, and let's be honest, it's not difficult to manipulate a child. Grandmother knew better, that's why she lied to everyone about getting \"mom's permission.\" Didn't think *once* about the daughters permission! I'm entirely not surprised the FIL left for a hotel as this does not seem like a one-off situation. IMO, MIL may have been trying to white-wash the daughter.", "Not everybody is the same. At 14 I had no independence at all. By saying 'she's 14 she should have said no' is victim-blaming the daughter. It wasn't her responsibility to say no, the grandmother should never have put her in that position in the first place.", "I'm definitely considering it. What I don't understand is why did the child believe it unless there was some sort of precedent leading up to this. Obviously OP was going to see her daughter's hair, so it wasn't like MIL could hide it.", "Oh yeah, my parents will go insane too. But there high chances I\u2019ll do it first : )"]}
