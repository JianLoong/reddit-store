It's unfortunate that your MIL and SIL reacted defensively, but it's crucial to stand by your decision to protect your daughter's boundaries, as it's fundamental to her sense of agency and self-identity. Your mother-in-law overstepped, and maintaining those boundaries is essential. Continue to support your daughter and ensure she feels heard and respected.

Your MIL's unauthorized actions didn't align with your daughter's desires, causing her a lot of distress. It seems essential for your MIL to understand and respect these boundaries for the well-being and comfort of your daughter. You and your husband seem to be taking the right steps by communicating and setting boundaries to ensure your daughter's comfort and autonomy are respected. Family dynamics can be tricky, but remember, what you're doing is ultimately for the welfare of your child, which should be the priority.

I know where your daughter is coming from because my Aunt did the same thing to me. She cut my waist length hair when I was 7. She didn\u2019t have my moms permission to do this she just didn\u2019t like that she had to put my hair in a braid at night , so she decided to give me and her daughter both a bowl cut and lie to my mom saying I wanted this cut also.

Seeing role models with varied appearances (hair types, styles, skin tones, physical abilities, sizes, facial features etc) that are celebrated will be crucial to making sure she doesn\u2019t internalize the idea that there\u2019s something \u201cwrong\u201d with any part of her that doesn\u2019t fit MIL\u2019s idea of what\u2019s best / appropriate / attractive.
