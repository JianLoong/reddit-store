Don't listen to anyone telling you your mil was acting in your daughters \"best interest.\" You're daughter is 14, she's old enough to decide for herself how she wants her hair. Your mil did this without her consent and she was crying after, it clearly wasn't in her best interest.", "NTA. Your MIL(and SIL apparently) don't know how to be decent people.

Consider adding your SIL into the list of people not allowed near your daughter too.", "NTA. However , is your daughter a very timid person or a shy person who is even afraid to talk back to her mom ? She is 14 yrs old and didn\u2019t want to cut her hair. However her grandma said that her mom gave permission to cut her hair and she didn\u2019t even call you and yell at you for \u201cgiving permission\u201d cut her hair against her wishes ? Like any normal teenage girl would ? Is she very reserved with you too ? You are NTA but is there anything else going on here that a 14 yr old would not raise hell when her body and hair are being violated ?", "NTA. The lying about having your permission is what really gets me. Lying to her granddaughter, lying to her husband... what did she expect to happen? I highly doubt that your FIL is contemplating their marriage because of this, it's more likely that he tried to confront her about it and she blew up, or maybe it's the straw that broke the camel's back.", "NTA, and it is abhorrent the level of disrespect your MIL showed your daughter and you. Now your SIL is jumping onto the wrong side. I would absolutely go No Contact with MIL and SIL until they are ready to apologize and acknowledge their mistakes. That is if your daughter will accept the apology.", "Is wasn't your daughter's best interest. It actively when against her desires and her body autonomy. She lied to your daughter, to her husband, and actively did something she clearly knew was wrong. Well, she gets to pay the price. She's one of those people who doesn't believe any boundaries are meant for her and she doesn't have to respect them. And telling your daughter that you approved...that's just disgusting. She's trying to undermine your relationship. Wow. NTA", "NTA - If she's willing to do this....who knows what else she wants to do for your daughter's \"best interests\". What's worse is your daughter was not consenting and was forced. Disgusting behavior.", "Restraining order", "Fuck that noise. She lied, violated a SERIOUS boundary, and hurt your kid (emotionally). You're being very kind and generous with even giving her a way to regain contact. Scorched earth for years would still make you NTA.

She doesn't see what she's done as wrong, which means more shenanigans could follow if she's allowed contact.", "Agreed, especially the \"saying it wasn't a crime for my MIL to act in my daughter's best interest\" part\n\n\"Best interest\"?
