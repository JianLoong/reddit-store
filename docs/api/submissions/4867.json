It's kinder to take them to a place where they'll have the best chance.   \n\nKeep looking out for yourself and your own dog. I don't understand how your mother could agree with this.

When we take on an animal, we're still taking on responsibility for a life. That means we pledge to take care of their medical needs. We also pledge to feed, shelter, protect and-most important of all-love them. This is true even if we are only fostering, because: who really knows how long your role as a foster will be? AND even fosters need all those things I just mentioned.\n\nI have fostered an animal in need, and I can testify to how hard it is. You can't control your heart, and if you fall for your foster and can't keep them (which happened to me) it can be heartbreaking. OP also has to consider the furbaby they already have, as well. What if those two animals bond? Then either OP has two new dogs that they didn't plan for, or they have to put their current dog through the pain of losing their companion. If they don't bond, then there will be tension in the household for as long as your foster is there.\n\nETA:\n\nThe brother and SIL and even your mother are being assholes in this case. It's ok that they asked, but their repeated insistence that you take on this commitment even though you have-repeatedly-expressed your unwillingness to do so, is not ok. Pets-dogs especially-are almost as hard to care for as children are. They require lots of attention and love in order to be happy. No one should pressure another person to take one on. If they aren't 100% into it, they have no business caring for ANY animal.\n\nIf you want to help, maybe volunteer to help them find a foster home if you want, but the truth is that it's not your responsibility to take those doggies, and they need to be somewhere they are wanted. Once again, it's not wrong to not want to take them on. It's actually more responsible for you to speak up rather than to take them unwillingly, and sacrifice the happiness of you all. It would be very irresponsible to risk exposing the dogs to a caregiver that resents them. Animals can sense how we feel about things-they definitely know when they aren't wanted.", "NTA. Please set clear boundaries and do the best for yourself and your pup. It is likely your brother's dogs will not take the separation well and end up being destruction or aggressive towards you. If you need to have them put down SIL is going to put the blame on you and make you the evil villain in her story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are within your rights to say \"no\" and don't have to justify it to anyone. Even so, your reasons are very solid.

It's a HUGE thing they are asking for and you are likely to get screwed over by them as this may drag out for months/years.

They haven't trained their dogs properly it seems, if they are destructive.\n\n2. They knew they were going to have a child, so why in all the time they have had the dogs, did they not acclimate them to being around children before having a baby?  \n\n3. Their dogs are small and elderly, so it isn't hard at all to keep a baby out of reach.  It isnt like these dogs are able to leap into the crib when they turn their backs for a second.  \n\n4. I wonder if the aggression is due to them having babied the dogs all along, as people often do with small dogs, and now they have a baby, they have been paying far less attention to the dogs, treating them as an annoyance and an inconvenience, possibly even neglecting them to some extent.  That would lead to the dogs being jealous of the baby and seeing baby as a rival for attention, hence the aggression.", "It depends on your type of house. I lived in a 1 bedroom flat when I had my baby and we were scared of what would happen if they didn't get along.

He also throws his weight at his kennel door when hes done being in there I have to use 2 carabiners to keep him from popping the latches on his heavy duty crate. He also flips the toilet lids up with his nose when he wants a drink. He is a stubborn unstoppable force of nature. Hes very well mannered and listens well, he just won't be contained unless he chooses to be and he prefers the spicy toilet water. We just keep the bathroom doors shut and I make sure to latch his crate with reinforcements on the rare occasions he needs to be kenneled, but gates were a lost cause and basically useless at this point with a dog that weighs more than me because he doesnt outsmart me, he out-brawns the gate with his thick skull.", "Nta and if your mom is so keen to agree the next time she wants to butt in where she doesn't belong simply tell her \"you're right it is heartless to leave the dogs without a home I will call SIL immediately and let them know you have decided to take the dogs.

Or if they are really set on dumping these poor dogs without trying to make it work, they need to keep them until a good home is found. A rescue could help place the dogs while they still live in your SIL's home.", "Tell her that response is heartless and is causing you stress. NTA", "Good point, cost me $500 to get a GSD trainer which I think is on the cheaper side. Either way it only took 4 sessions to see 100% improvement.", "NTA, tell your mother to take the dogs", "NTA, not your problem. Three dogs are a big responsibility  and a lot of work. I had 3 small dogs (each under 10 pounds) for 9 years until the oldest dog passed away. My husband surprised me with a puppy and I cried. Not tears of joy, tears of I don't want to take care of 3 pets. This isn't a 2 week vacation.  The deal is you keep them until....... It's an indefinite period of care. What about the extra cost of food, damage to  your home and vet care? Stay strong and don't do it. You can't predict how your dog will react. Will the bonded pair go after your dog? There are too many unknowns.", "NTA You have no responsibility to take these dogs. She should advertise to rehome the dogs. In my are small dogs are in great demand. Those are the first gone from our local shelters. She could also advertise them on Petfinder or on social media marketplace sites.\n\nDo not take the dogs they are responsible for their animals. Trying to guilt you into taking dogs you don't want is not solving the problem it is passing their problem onto someone else.", "Of course not. Why do it when you can drop the animals at OP... /s", "NTA If SIL loved the dogs so much she should have dealt with their behavioral issues before the baby arrived. You are not their solution and would be insane to agree to take them because there's a good chance they will just focus on baby and expect you to keep the dogs for life so they stay in the family.", "NTA. My old roommate \u201ctemporarily\u201d housed 2 cats for her pregnant friend until they could find more stable housing. Guess what? The cats were in the house for over a year. The friend never once tried to find a place for kitties,didn\u2019t pay for food, litter, or vet care bc \u201comg babies are expensive!\u201d Because one roommate was allergic the cats had to be kept in one room, which they destroyed. It sucked for them and it sucked for us. Eventually they were adopted out but only thru my roommate\u2019s initiative, her friend didn\u2019t lift a finger once they were out of her care.", "NTA you have every right to not take them in, but FYI your SIL is correct, most shelters and rescues are over capacity right now. NYT just posted an article about this the other day.", "NTA- not your responsibility. If your mom wants to help, let her take them.", "NTA. They need to figure it out themselves. Also there\u2019s no such thing as a no kill shelter. All shelters euthanize. Even \u201cno kill\u201d. Basically as long as they deem the animal to be non-adoptable, they can euthanize it without it affecting their status. For more information check out the Asilomar Accords."]}
