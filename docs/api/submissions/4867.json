I'll try to make it brief.\n\nMy brother(35) and his wife(28) are new parents. They have 2 small dogs(both <15 pounds). Recently, one of the dogs has shown aggression towards the new baby, and as a result they want to get rid of both of the dogs. When they told me this, I totally agreed that they should put the safety of their baby above anything related to the dog(s).\n\nHowever, after I agreed with their thoughts on the matter, they asked me to take the dogs for them. They live a 5+ hour drive away, and they offered to drive the dogs out to me so I could take them off their hands. I don't want to take the dogs. I think they should just take the dogs to a rescue or a shelter and told them as much. SIL cried and said the dogs would be put down in a rescue and that she needed my help. She said it would only be temporary and I would only have to keep them as long as it took for them to find the dogs a home.\n\nThere are a few huge issues with this. I already have a dog and I don't have time for two more, especially since their two dogs have bad/destructive habits.\n\nThey also want to make sure the dogs are adopted/rehomed together, refuse to give them to someone who wants to separate them, so I would likely end up having to keep the dogs for quite a while.\n\nThis seems unreasonable to me. I love dogs and I feel bad for them, but I told them no and that I wouldn't change my mind. I offered to help them find a no-kill shelter or dog rescue to send them to in their area, but this upset SIL a lot. My mother agrees with them and says I'm being heartless and causing them stress.

Their kids, their dogs, their problem.\n\nI don't mean to be heartless, but the fact of the matter is that they're imposing this \"solution\" on you instead of figuring one out on their own. Getting rid of a pet to protect a new baby is very unfortunate, but it's nobody's responsibility but their own. It's their burden to bear.\n\nThe audacity of them and your mother. Your mom can take the dogs if she's so upset about it.", "Once you take them, I doubt SIL will try very hard, if at all, to look for a new home for the dogs.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nBrother and SIL are indeed unreasonable. They didn't just ask you to take the dogs (asking is always legit) but they got upset at your no and tried to change your mind (I'm guessing here, but I think it was your brother to involve your mom in the issue).", "NTA. Nobody should be forced to take care of animals that aren't there's especially ones with behavior problems", "NTA. You don't have any obligation to take care of their dogs just because they can't be bothered to care of their dogs anymore. That is a problem for them to figure out.", "NTA, no you said no. People need to realize it\u2019s harder than a ohh here\u2019s the dogs they will be fine until I get back, heck no, you stay strong. She can ask your mom to watch the dog since she has such a big say so in this or she feels so opinionated.", "NTA- it sounds like you recognize your limitations and are setting healthy boundaries.\n\nNewborns are stressful, but it doesn\u2019t mean you can suddenly dump your responsibilities on someone else.", "NTA\n\nIf they\u2019re that worried about the dogs, they can keep them. They don\u2019t get to insist that you carry their worries and burden for them.\n\nAnd if your mother is that worried about the dogs, I assume she\u2019s ready and willing to take them on. Thanks, mother dearest!", "NTA\n\nThe ones being heartless and causing them stress is themselves. Having a pet is the same as having a child, you signed up for it and whatever it entails. Just because the dogs start showing aggression, instead of training it, they decided to go with the cheap and easy solution which is getting rid of them. Hypocritical behavior. \n\nBtw if mother feels so strongly, she should take the dogs in. If not she should shut up and stay neutral or condemn brother and SIL for being shitty people", "NTA.\n\nIt's weird SIL won't agree to a no kill shelter and makes me think she wants to control where exactly they go. That's not totally unreasonable to have that desire, but how is it your responsibility to take them on? Do they want to have the dogs without having the dogs?\n\nA no-kill will put in time and their best effort to train any bad/destructive habits away, and ensure they go to homes with suitable situations (no kids, cats etc). They also have contracts with the owners. \"Private rehoming\" makes me cringe. I've heard of dogs getting passed on, and on, and on. It's kinder to take them to a place where they'll have the best chance.   \n\nKeep looking out for yourself and your own dog. I don't understand how your mother could agree with this. My mum would want to smack me if I tried to pull this crap.", "NTA, but those poor puppers.", "NTA you have to consider your life and your dog's life. If you wanted more dogs you would have more dogs.", "NTA but I do feel bad for the dogs. If you\u2019re in the US suggest they use the Next Door app to see if anyone living nearby can temporally take them?", "NTA.\n\nIf you don't have time for the dogs it would be irresponsible to take them.\n\nI suggest moseying over to r/dogs (or advising your brother and SIL to do so) as they might have some useful suggestions on this kind of situation.", "NTA\n\nTaking on a dog (or cat, for that matter....any animal) is a commitment that we should take seriously. When we take on an animal, we're still taking on responsibility for a life. That means we pledge to take care of their medical needs. We also pledge to feed, shelter, protect and-most important of all-love them. This is true even if we are only fostering, because: who really knows how long your role as a foster will be? AND even fosters need all those things I just mentioned.\n\nI have fostered an animal in need, and I can testify to how hard it is. You can't control your heart, and if you fall for your foster and can't keep them (which happened to me) it can be heartbreaking. OP also has to consider the furbaby they already have, as well. What if those two animals bond? Then either OP has two new dogs that they didn't plan for, or they have to put their current dog through the pain of losing their companion. If they don't bond, then there will be tension in the household for as long as your foster is there.\n\nETA:\n\nThe brother and SIL and even your mother are being assholes in this case. It's ok that they asked, but their repeated insistence that you take on this commitment even though you have-repeatedly-expressed your unwillingness to do so, is not ok. Pets-dogs especially-are almost as hard to care for as children are. They require lots of attention and love in order to be happy. No one should pressure another person to take one on. If they aren't 100% into it, they have no business caring for ANY animal.\n\nIf you want to help, maybe volunteer to help them find a foster home if you want, but the truth is that it's not your responsibility to take those doggies, and they need to be somewhere they are wanted. Once again, it's not wrong to not want to take them on. It's actually more responsible for you to speak up rather than to take them unwillingly, and sacrifice the happiness of you all. It would be very irresponsible to risk exposing the dogs to a caregiver that resents them. Animals can sense how we feel about things-they definitely know when they aren't wanted.", "NTA. Please set clear boundaries and do the best for yourself and your pup. It is likely your brother's dogs will not take the separation well and end up being destruction or aggressive towards you. If you need to have them put down SIL is going to put the blame on you and make you the evil villain in her story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The owners should have thought of the consequences before they got the dogs or had the baby. Rescue shelter it is or they can advertise locally asking for someone who wants to rehome them, possibly with a donation. Else you will be looking after the dogs for lifetime as a child does need to be much older before the SIL would have the dogs back and there's a chance it might never happen.", "NTA. It's sad but they need to either separate the dogs or find someone else. You cannot take care of three dogs.", "NTA", "NTA. You are within your rights to say \"no\" and don't have to justify it to anyone. Even so, your reasons are very solid. Expecting to keep these dogs together will result in a VERY extended time with you, and with a new baby at home, they will be too busy to put much effort into finding a good home. It's a HUGE thing they are asking for and you are likely to get screwed over by them as this may drag out for months/years. Finding a no kill shelter is the best plan, and SIL needs to come to terms with that and move forward. Their dogs, their life, their responsibility.", "NTA for all the reasons others have said, but your SIL and brother are. I have some real issues with them regarding dog ownership such as:\n\n1. They haven't trained their dogs properly it seems, if they are destructive.\n\n2. They knew they were going to have a child, so why in all the time they have had the dogs, did they not acclimate them to being around children before having a baby?  \n\n3. Their dogs are small and elderly, so it isn't hard at all to keep a baby out of reach.  It isnt like these dogs are able to leap into the crib when they turn their backs for a second.  \n\n4. I wonder if the aggression is due to them having babied the dogs all along, as people often do with small dogs, and now they have a baby, they have been paying far less attention to the dogs, treating them as an annoyance and an inconvenience, possibly even neglecting them to some extent.  That would lead to the dogs being jealous of the baby and seeing baby as a rival for attention, hence the aggression.", "It depends on your type of house. I lived in a 1 bedroom flat when I had my baby and we were scared of what would happen if they didn't get along. Even now in a 2-up-2-down it's tough to keep the puppers away if we have un-dog-trained kids over, we have to put them outside.", "that was one of my concerns as well, honestly, and why I'm so certain I won't be changing my mind.\n\nAnother concern was that they'd just try to leave them with me until their child got old enough that they could take the dogs back.", "oh, good idea. I'll have my mother suggest that to them since we're no longer on speaking terms.\n\nI do feel really bad for the dogs, as well. They're both elderly and I know they won't want to leave their family.", "Yeah, I feel really bad for not wanting to take them on, but I have some issues with anxiety and I know it won't be good for me to take care of all three of them. \n\nMy own dog had a lot of behavioral issues when I got him and it took a year to get him to the point that I didn't need to constantly be keeping an eye on him. I just don't have the time to train their two dogs who are very much set in their ways, and I don't want to resent them or the situation at all. I think the odds of these two dogs finding a loving home are good... it just can't be with me.", "I mean, even if they had to figure something out with a network of baby gates they could do it.", "That\u2019s crazy you\u2019re being treated like that, Im sorry. I have crazy family too it fucking sucks."]}
