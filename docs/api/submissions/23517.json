One weekend, he just didn't go home. I waited a day or 2 and asked him what was going on. He admitted he had lost his job, which his home was tied to and asked if he could stay a couple weeks. I agreed but made it clear he could not stay and I didn't want weekday drinking or drunkenness around the kids (I drink when they aren't home or special occasions). He proceeded to get drunk every day. \nEven my son's birthday, I asked him to please not drink until the kids left. He got nasty with me that this is his routine, and he would do what he wanted, so I said, do it somewhere else. I continued to feel like he was always talking down to me, combating me on things, and I pointed it out and how it was making me feel defensive. That I felt like he was trying to make me small. He argued that he was just asserting himself because he felt like he had to bend to my plans (like my son's birthday). \nWell today he was Drunk AF by 10am. While I'm trying to pack myself and the kids for camping and get my school work done. I left for a bit for a teddy bear picnic with the kids and came back to him passed out on the couch so the kids couldn't play. I woke him up and told him it was inappropriate and to atleast go sleep it off in a bedroom so the kids didn't have to see that shit. He was pissed because I had no right to wake him up angry (I only got angry because he was so drunk it was extremely difficult to wake him up). \nI tried to use my air compressor to fill up my tire. He called me stupid because obviously the plug I plugged it into didn't work, I tried to say I know it works, I just had lights on plugged into it. He got made at me for challenging him (this is the kind of thing he had been doing the last 2 weeks, I would do something, around my house! With my stuff! And he would try to tell me to do it differently, and I would say what my experience was and he would get all pissy that I am arguing with him. Or he would be doing something with my stuff, and I would offer my knowledge and he would say I was talking down to him). Well it turns out he had shut to pump off. That why the compressor wasn't filling up. As I knew the outlets were fine. After he had called me stupid, I whispered 'dont talk to me like that, especially in front of my kids'. He yelled at me to not talk to him like that. And that 'he's not the one who came in me to make them'. This was my last straw, I told him to get the F out of my house. He didn't. He went to sleep in my bed, I made him leave. Now he is blaming me saying that this is all because I have unresolved issues with my ex. He is trying to make me believe that his behaviour was acceptable and that I am over reacting. And that I had no right to be mad. \nAITA?\n\nEdit: he did get another job right away. I wrote the slow start of assholery off as him being depressed about his situation. But it kept getting worse. He is out. I just needed confirmation that I wasn't over reacting.", "created_utc": 1690758488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dzh3p/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out_when_he_didnt_even_ask/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will add in my two cents on the drinking around kids; well getting wasted around them isn\u2019t smart I don\u2019t think hiding having a couple beers is smart either. It can set up a weirdness with alcohol. \n\nMy cousin who is the aunt of my second cousin has custody of her. When I was visiting a few summers ago, cousin & I cracked a beer at the family BBQ & second cousin who had never seen cousin drink was really weird about it. Treated my cousin like she was an alcoholic & was super wasted after just one beer which is all she had since shes not a big drinker. It was weird & when I asked my cuz if no one ever drank around second cuz she said no, no one ever did cause she was a kid & now she thinks it may have been a mistake to shelter her that much.", "Call the police to remove him.

He\u2019s being abusive. You have a responsibility to your children to protect them. What they are seeing in his behavior is that this is how relationships work and it\u2019s ok to be drunk, unemployed, angry and shouting at your partner and kids. Get rid of him. He\u2019s a loser and a bum. I hope your kids aren\u2019t female and start thinking this is how men treat women and that they should allow that in a relationship when they are older.", "NTA Change the locks while he is out.

It's only been a week or 2 of this behaviour and at first, I let it slide because I thought it was just lashing out because of being depressed over his situation. And I tried to talk it out and set boundaries.", "Thank you! He thinks he's so smart because he was a gifted kid. I think it causes him to look down on everyone else around him", "Working on it! Going to have fun with my babies and snuggle them hard tonight", "I even explained to him that their father had alcohol issues and they know it because they saw it and ask me about it. I explained it was for their mental health. But he made me feel like a jerk for imposing my problems with my ex on him.", "I said that to him. Then go do it somewhere else cause if you can't wait a few hours after work for a drink because it's a kids birthday party then something is seriously wrong with you", "Me too. I feel lighter. Was walking on eggshells the last few days. He did get another job right away. That just seemed to make him worse.", "It did start to get scary these last few days. I have been walking on eggshells.", "It is. Was before I posted. But he tried to tell me that the problem is my unresolved issues with the kids dad (because he was a closet drunk who hide it).", "Yes. Or just someone I used to know. 6 months is barely an ex at all", "No not even then.  He\u2019s a drunk whose yelling at her in front of her kids.  There\u2019s dildos out there who can make her see stars without all the baggage.", "Because he has only acted this way for a week or 2. He wasn't like this to me at all before. I was honestly taken a back and worried I had done something to make him treat me this way. I do have a big strong personality that can be intimidating.", "I'm so sorry. I grew up like that. I won't let my kids. He can figure out his own life like a big boy. I had to when I lived on my own as a young teen.", "I thought 5 months was a good amount of time. But I was wrong. Won't be introducing anyone to my kids from now on.", "I did. Before I posted. Just needed the reassurance to strengthen my resolve.", "Thank you. I just needed to make sure I wasn't being emotional and reactive.", "What about this guy even makes you want him?", "Change them fast, you really never know with drunk guys what they could do at any time", "If he had a key, you might want to change your locks.", "I\u2019m going to put this bluntly: you can\u2019t reason with alcoholics, and you can\u2019t reason with abusers. This dude is both. NTA but please consider why you were willing to tolerate any of his behavior around your kids. You and they deserve so much better.", "You don\u2019t deal with abuse by making I statements. Abusers don\u2019t suddenly treat you better because you communicated your feelings. You have to end the relationship when you see the red flags. Your behavior didn\u2019t cause the abuse, and changing your behavior won\u2019t fix it.", "Indeed. And that is how an addict loses their job, their home, and and their relationship.", "It seems like he played you. He was nice until he weaseled his way in. You sound very kind and empathetic, and he sounds like a manipulator.", "You just saw the real him. He violated everything you asked of him. He obviously has a drinking oroblem and he became verbally abusive. Don't  \"most definitely never around my children again\". YOU should not be around him again.", "Charmed his way in until he was in control.", "[removed]", "DTMFA.  Done and dusted.", "Love it", "Sounds like a perfect day to me.", "Then why in the hell would you even want to maintain contact?? Jesus. Get some standards.", "You can\u2019t allow yourself to go through this either. Your home is your sanctuary, guard it fiercely", "Oh then everything is fine. Let an alcoholic random Guy make the Law and call you stupid in your own house. In front of the kid. Lik\u00e9 you and your kid deserve so much better.  When he was love bombing you it was not his true self. His true self is the drunk one... and his true love and first mistress is a bottle, not you.", "How are you even tempted to feel like the ahole? No offence but it shouldn\u2019t even be hard to stay away from him.  \n\nIf you find separating yourself from this guy hard you might want to examine yourself\u2026because you might have some self esteem issues.", "Yeah that was my bad, sorry.", "Lol I'll shop for my new BF on red dragon \ud83d\ude02", "Good job standing up for yourself, op, and try not to be so hard on yourself. You deserve better and I really hope you find it. Good luck moving forward!", "You aren\u2019t! He is gaslighting you and being verbally abusive and you don\u2019t have to put up with it! Kick him out and block him everywhere. BYE!", "You're not, but so what if you are? You don't have to stay with anyone if you don't want to. And you certainly don't have to let them sponge off you.", "The 6 months before this happened. We had amazing communication. On a level I had never experienced before. He was sweet and kind and thoughtful. And we connected on so many things. But I guess that wasn't really him.", "I definitely need to. He lost his first key. I got the second one.", "And this guy managed to do all of that in a matter of weeks.  A real big rock getting closer and closer to that bottom.", "I am empathetic. It's my job to be lol. But I need to find the line of when to stop helping others and take better care of myself.", "You're right. I deserve better. I just got out of this kind of relationship. I need to look at myself and figure out why I found another one.", "Charmed his way in and tried to take control and got pissed when I wouldn't let him take it", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

But I will make sure it's clear", "It was great. And I am glad the kids had that. Because they are confused now.", "I knew I felt weird and icky as soon as I realized what was happening. I couldn't put my finger on why I didn't want him staying here when at first I had been so happy to have an extra day with him. But the second day, I felt weird.", "You're right. I even said that to him a few nights ago. That I didn't think I could be the mistress to alcohol again.", "I do. I know I do. And I will be doing a hard examination to understand why I let myself get caught up in this kind of crap again.", "I totally get it. I feel horrible for allowing this even, for a short time, around my kids or ever allowing them to get to know him. Now they will experience the loss all over again. It was a mistake I will take seriously. Don't think I'll be dating again until they are old and moved out", "Yasss girl.  May the batteries always be fully charged lol", "Thank you. I hope so too. And I'll try to not be. I did the right thing for me and my kids.", "I did. But needed the reassurance I was right. He even continued to text me that he wants to make amends but I am being unreasonable. Then tried to say that other than to get his stuff, I need to resolve my issues with my ex before we can talk again. I just laughed and ignored it.", "Abusive guys are always super into you in the beginning. They think you're perfect, and when they realize you aren't, they hate you for it, and will blame you for their own miserable lives. This guy is bad, bad news. You owe it to yourself, and your kids, to hold out for a guy who treats you well. And it won't be this guy, no matter what he promises.", "I just hate reading about this kind of manipulation. It\u2019s always nice people like you that get targeted, it seems.", "NTA.  He has shown you his true colors.  He was making you think he was somebody else.  The once your comfortable with him, he shows you who he really is, an abusive, condescending, drunk.", "Change the locks ASAP for your safety and your kids' safety. \n\nSounds like he did a good job hiding his true nature until he lost his job and asked to move in with you. Dude was definitely hiding the drinking at his place.\n\nThe right one is out there for you and this one is definitely not it. My mom had several duds (including my and my older brother's biological fathers) before marrying my dad so don't give up on all partners just yet. They've been married 33 years last month. Just have to find someone who will love you and your littles they way all of you deserve.", "I hope he hits bottom and gets help. That's the most I can do I think.", "You need to care more about what your kids are being exposed to in their safe space then some drunk loser. Get him out like yesterday, should\u2019ve never agreed to letting him stay. The kids deserve better than mommy\u2019s drunk boyfriend messing up their birthday.", "You are probably a Fixer. It can be a wonderful quality and a terrible burden, it can also be a window that bad people sneak in through and get their hooks into you.\n\nI know Reddit always says this but- therapy.\n\nAnd put your own oxygen mask on first.", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re moving on. I get so pissed off with people who are basically living off people they hope they can victimize.", "Good.  Take care of you and yours.  <3", "Been going back and forth with this but I\u2019ll put it out there and you\u2019ll know best as you\u2019re their mom.  And know that I don\u2019t have kids, but I am a social worker with extensive history with children and I currently work with addicted people\u2026and a bottle of booze is essentially my family\u2019s crest\u2026so here it is:\n\nI don\u2019t know how old your kids are but you may want to have a talk with them about the guy and his actions.  Maybe explain to them how he is sick but in a way that you guys can\u2019t help him and that he doesn\u2019t think he needs help yet.  I\u2019d also try and tell them how they will have to make personal boundaries and values and what is acceptable behavior and unacceptable behavior and what not.  Even little ankle biters are often smarter and more perceptive than we give them credit and they probably got a whole lot of questions about this situation.  Sorry you\u2019re in a mess but glad you ended things.", "Glad you listened to yourself and didn\u2019t let it drag on", "Was one of your parent alcoholic ? That could explain why you feel you need to save him. You can't. Only him Can, and he need to do it alone. Better be alone than with such a guy. \nWorse being that you reproduce the trauma unknowingly and pass it to your kid. Girls identify with you and will get shitty partner, boy with him.\n Learn to love and respect yourself like you love and respect your kid.  Life IS already hard don't bring New trauma and toxicity for someone you barely know. And all the Time and love you give to him, give it to you and the kid.", "If you're open to it, therapy may be helpful for you getting to the root of it.", "You absolutely did the right thing and should hold your head up for standing up for yourself and your kids!", "You resolved your issue with your ex by making him your ex. You showed that you don\u2019t continue to have an issue by dropping this guy as well. This guy has so many screws loose, babies would confuse him for a rattle.", "I think you are right. It's so hard. It's been over a decade since I've dated and I didn't have kids then. I don't know what I am doing any more. Everything is different now.", "Probably because I am a youth worker and I spend all day trying to help people understand why people do things and help them heal to better versions of themselves. Now I need to look at how I ended up back in this type of situation.", "I hope I will but the way society is today, seems like a fairy tale and unrealistic for today's society.", "Yeah, you did more than you ever had to.  He needs help that you cannot and should not provide.", "That's what I said to him! And he is out now. But was telling me that I was over reacting because of the kids father's addiction issues and I needed the peace of mind from asking outside opinions.", "Hobosexuals. I've had my fair share as an independent woman who's lived on her own since a young teen and kept a roof over my head and a job and put myself through school. Unfortunately we seem to attract em.", "Thank you", "Basically the same talk I had with them a year ago about their Father. I feel awful they were exposed to this shit again. You're 100% right. I had told them all along that he wasn't staying here long and just said that he found a new place to live and wanted to go check it out right away.", "Both were. One alcoholic, who died from drinking and one addict. And yes. I feel like the worst mom for allowing them to be exposed even a little bit to this shit again (their father a year ago...)", "Been in therapy my whole life. But I have a new direction to turn it to.", "Thank you. I will try. It's hard right now while I feel so badly for making these mistakes. But I will continue to role model for my kids. That we deserve respect.", "You can get through it. Just focus on your kids, be a good mom, take care of yourself, and the right guy will find you. Until then, it's better to be alone with your kids, than compounding your problems (and exposing your kids to bad shit) with a guy like that who's only going to make your life that much harder.", "\u2764\ufe0f", "You may want to try to get some therapy; it really helped me get through to why I always chose bad men.\n\nAs it happened, though, after my rat-bastard of an ex-husband, I decided my taste in men was abysmal, and I stopped looking around for a mate. I didn't want to inflict my bad taste on my son, who was only 3 years old when I left his dad.\n\nIt was hard for the longest time, but I've adapted to being single. I was so traumatized by that last relationship that I never wanted to try again. \ud83d\udc94", "Thank you. I thought I was being kind. But he acted like cooking supper for me and the kids meant that he could do whatever he wanted, and that if I had any issues with his behaviour I was being ungrateful for his effort.", "Screw empathy (unless you're at work or you're caring for your babies.)  Boyfriends of 6 months don't get empathy. Kids first, then you (because if you're not taking care of you, you're not at your best for them), then the boyfriends can have a little consideration, but they are low on the hierarchy, especially when they're using your history with your ex to manipulate you.\n\nDon't let boyfriends run your life or your house. Period. You want a partner, not a leech sucking you dry.  Take your time picking the next one. No rush.", "It's what you grew up with.", "yw.  <3", "You are their parent and you know best *but* you should consider making an explicit connection for them between his behavior and his leaving, that you made him leave. Age appropriate of course. They may have felt unsafe and confused and knowing you took action and made him leave could actually reassure them.", "I know. Having Bad parent is a lifelong curse. Really better be alone than with someone you can't trust and bring you down. You learned, you recognize the signal. But you normalise it.  You Can listen to podcast or audio Books if you don't have Time to read. How to break the cycle etc wishing you the best.", "I will be a spinster too haha. Fuk em all. Just me and my littles.", "Yes! That's what I kept saying. I want a partner. He wouldn't even help me out around the house because he was taken advantage of before and didn't want to risk it. And I was like, but you are staying at my house for free??!!!", "Yes all of that!", "Thank you. I think this is a good idea. I had been doing great about breaking the cycle with my own behaviour but I need to look more into my choices of people.", "It's crazy how strong their print is. WE try to choose the opposite and in the end realise it's the same. It's a lot of work to deconstruct but so worth it in the end. And if you managed to fixe your troubles, don't carry the other waiting for them to fix their troubles. I don't want alcoholic drug addict or smoker at home... Easier for me this way.", "I've been working so hard but now I have a direction to focus in a bit better atleast."]}
