One weekend, he just didn't go home. I waited a day or 2 and asked him what was going on. He admitted he had lost his job, which his home was tied to and asked if he could stay a couple weeks. I agreed but made it clear he could not stay and I didn't want weekday drinking or drunkenness around the kids (I drink when they aren't home or special occasions). He proceeded to get drunk every day. \nEven my son's birthday, I asked him to please not drink until the kids left. He got nasty with me that this is his routine, and he would do what he wanted, so I said, do it somewhere else. I continued to feel like he was always talking down to me, combating me on things, and I pointed it out and how it was making me feel defensive. That I felt like he was trying to make me small. He argued that he was just asserting himself because he felt like he had to bend to my plans (like my son's birthday). \nWell today he was Drunk AF by 10am. While I'm trying to pack myself and the kids for camping and get my school work done. I left for a bit for a teddy bear picnic with the kids and came back to him passed out on the couch so the kids couldn't play. I woke him up and told him it was inappropriate and to atleast go sleep it off in a bedroom so the kids didn't have to see that shit. He was pissed because I had no right to wake him up angry (I only got angry because he was so drunk it was extremely difficult to wake him up). \nI tried to use my air compressor to fill up my tire. He called me stupid because obviously the plug I plugged it into didn't work, I tried to say I know it works, I just had lights on plugged into it. He got made at me for challenging him (this is the kind of thing he had been doing the last 2 weeks, I would do something, around my house! With my stuff! And he would try to tell me to do it differently, and I would say what my experience was and he would get all pissy that I am arguing with him. Or he would be doing something with my stuff, and I would offer my knowledge and he would say I was talking down to him). Well it turns out he had shut to pump off. That why the compressor wasn't filling up. As I knew the outlets were fine. After he had called me stupid, I whispered 'dont talk to me like that, especially in front of my kids'. He yelled at me to not talk to him like that. And that 'he's not the one who came in me to make them'. This was my last straw, I told him to get the F out of my house. He didn't. He went to sleep in my bed, I made him leave. Now he is blaming me saying that this is all because I have unresolved issues with my ex. He is trying to make me believe that his behaviour was acceptable and that I am over reacting. And that I had no right to be mad. \nAITA?\n\nEdit: he did get another job right away. I wrote the slow start of assholery off as him being depressed about his situation. But it kept getting worse. He is out. I just needed confirmation that I wasn't over reacting.\n\nAnother edit to ad this resource someone posted that might help other people. \nhttps://youtu.be/zyUBS3rp2_A", "created_utc": 1690758488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dzh3p/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out_when_he_didnt_even_ask/", "score": 578, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will add in my two cents on the drinking around kids; well getting wasted around them isn\u2019t smart I don\u2019t think hiding having a couple beers is smart either. It can set up a weirdness with alcohol. \n\nMy cousin who is the aunt of my second cousin has custody of her. When I was visiting a few summers ago, cousin & I cracked a beer at the family BBQ & second cousin who had never seen cousin drink was really weird about it. Treated my cousin like she was an alcoholic & was super wasted after just one beer which is all she had since shes not a big drinker. It was weird & when I asked my cuz if no one ever drank around second cuz she said no, no one ever did cause she was a kid & now she thinks it may have been a mistake to shelter her that much.", "Call the police to remove him. Tell them he\u2019s drunk and threatening you and your children. They\u2019ll remove him. When he\u2019s gone pack his bags and leave them on the curb. Then refuse any contact with him. He\u2019s being abusive. You have a responsibility to your children to protect them. What they are seeing in his behavior is that this is how relationships work and it\u2019s ok to be drunk, unemployed, angry and shouting at your partner and kids. Get rid of him. He\u2019s a loser and a bum. I hope your kids aren\u2019t female and start thinking this is how men treat women and that they should allow that in a relationship when they are older.", "NTA Change the locks while he is out. He's trying to isolate and diminish you and is, imho, dangerous to you and your family.", "NTA OP but...barely. You dodged a bullet with this guy but only after letting him shoot you dozens of times.

And, being recently separated/divorced is pretty damn emotional too. If someone treats me badly, they don't get a pass just bc I'm not perfect. \n\nI always tell people, life is hard enough without people making it harder for no reason. And, it is easy to treat people good when everything is going great. But, how someone treats me when shit is going wrong is the important part of friendship. The rest is just having a good time.", "i hope you do that for the safety of you all, i\u2019m sorry you had to experience this at all.", "Oof. That sucks.", "Meh, people can be mean. I know I am mean on some of these really crazy posts (when the OP is the massive jerk! Lol). Maybe if you can, talk to a counselor so you can keep centered. Like, why do you pick these needy addicts? That kind of thing. But if not, just keep your kids front and center and dont let anyone try and make you feel incompetent again. I mean, not all women can opererate an air compressor to fill their tires. You are a single mom, and man is THAT hard! I can change a tire, change oil, mow a yard, and until I threw my back out, throw feed sacks and bails of hay around, and a whole lot more. But being a single Mom would terrify me. I have an amazing dh and dad for my kids. I feel like I couldnt function as a mom without him helping. You sound like a nice person who by being nice, got sucked into some bad shit...live and learn. Don't dont repeat the mistake. ;) But also take pride in ALL that you are doing on your own.", "What you need is to stop dating and figure out who you are without a man in your life. Once you get your self esteem back from surviving on your own terms, you will not be so susceptible to this kind of weirdo loser predator. \n\nI know it is very cliche to say don't date. But, it works. I personally have been there and put up with absolute shit bf bc I didn't have my own identity. Whoever I was dating was my identity. So, when they were assholes, I thought that was my problem. You can't just find a healthy guy just bc you want a healthy guy. It doesn't work like that. You need to be your own woman who truly knows herself inside and out before you can be a good partner in a healthy relationship.", "Don\u2019t bring men around your children after a few months. Still not long enough. Children need stability and you need to have fully vetted a guy before you bring them around your kids, imo. \n\nAnd as another poster said, seek therapy. People who end up with abusers tend to attract them continually. You need to figure out why you let him stomp all over your boundaries and work on that. \n\nYou did good making him an ex.

It caught me off guard.", "I was just blind with infatuation I guess.", "Thank you. I am trying. I do everything myself.

Just fucking crazy.", "He thought he was in, and he didn\u2019t need to play nice anymore. He got comfortable, dropped the mask and decided to teach you a lesson in how to treat him. \n\nLucky for you, you weren\u2019t up for letting someone behave that way in front of your kids. Although I suspect if you didn\u2019t have kids to protect, you might be still here giving him sixth and seventh chances to bring Mr Nice back out again. Good job your instincts to protect them are sharper than a desire to be nice and helpful to men who don\u2019t deserve it! You\u2019re a good mom. That\u2019s important.", "Just curious, are you a Canadian living in Ontario?? Because, same. The wait for mental health services is fucking ridiculous.", "Ignore the people disagreeing with you kicking him out. He was a verbally abusive, gaslighting drunkard who shouldn't have been around your kids. Good thing he's gone from your life. Change the locks & don't fall for a guy like him again. NTA.", "You are absolutely right.  Patriarchy, including sexism and misogyny ( among the many bigotries patriarchy fosters) make girls and women think that this is simply what they have to put up with to be in a heterosexual relationship.\n\nPatriarchy is the ocean we ALL swim in, only occasionally realizing how it hurts both women AND men.\n\nI get that this is rather ideologically  written, but I bet you get my general thought on this.", "Appears to be so", "That is what I am working on.", "Thank you. So many telling me I am negligent for even letting it happen in the first place. And I do feel awful for it. But they only say the all stuff. Didn't hear the bad stuff.", "I am! \ud83d\ude33 I lost all my supports around the time the kids dad and I split up. When I needed it the most. Been trying my best.", "No one is disagreeing with that. Just telling me I am insane, and a terrible negligent mother in the first place for even letting him stay one day, even though he had been great to me and my kids until. The last weekish but still good to the kids. And wasn't awful to me. It was subtle. Until today. That was not subtle anymore.", "I wholeheartedly agree with you. The patriarchy is exactly why she's asking if she's the asshole, and Jesus fuck this has to change.", "I prefer to be a spinster over having to deal with a dirtbag of a partner.", "You don\u2019t need a romantic relationship, necessarily.
