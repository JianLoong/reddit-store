One weekend, he just didn't go home. I waited a day or 2 and asked him what was going on. He admitted he had lost his job, which his home was tied to and asked if he could stay a couple weeks. I agreed but made it clear he could not stay and I didn't want weekday drinking or drunkenness around the kids (I drink when they aren't home or special occasions). He proceeded to get drunk every day. \nEven my son's birthday, I asked him to please not drink until the kids left. He got nasty with me that this is his routine, and he would do what he wanted, so I said, do it somewhere else. I continued to feel like he was always talking down to me, combating me on things, and I pointed it out and how it was making me feel defensive. That I felt like he was trying to make me small. He argued that he was just asserting himself because he felt like he had to bend to my plans (like my son's birthday). \nWell today he was Drunk AF by 10am. While I'm trying to pack myself and the kids for camping and get my school work done. I left for a bit for a teddy bear picnic with the kids and came back to him passed out on the couch so the kids couldn't play. I woke him up and told him it was inappropriate and to atleast go sleep it off in a bedroom so the kids didn't have to see that shit. He was pissed because I had no right to wake him up angry (I only got angry because he was so drunk it was extremely difficult to wake him up). \nI tried to use my air compressor to fill up my tire. He called me stupid because obviously the plug I plugged it into didn't work, I tried to say I know it works, I just had lights on plugged into it. He got made at me for challenging him (this is the kind of thing he had been doing the last 2 weeks, I would do something, around my house! With my stuff! And he would try to tell me to do it differently, and I would say what my experience was and he would get all pissy that I am arguing with him. Or he would be doing something with my stuff, and I would offer my knowledge and he would say I was talking down to him). Well it turns out he had shut to pump off. That why the compressor wasn't filling up. As I knew the outlets were fine. After he had called me stupid, I whispered 'dont talk to me like that, especially in front of my kids'. He yelled at me to not talk to him like that. And that 'he's not the one who came in me to make them'. This was my last straw, I told him to get the F out of my house. He didn't. He went to sleep in my bed, I made him leave. Now he is blaming me saying that this is all because I have unresolved issues with my ex. He is trying to make me believe that his behaviour was acceptable and that I am over reacting. And that I had no right to be mad. \nAITA?\n\nEdit: he did get another job right away. I wrote the slow start of assholery off as him being depressed about his situation. But it kept getting worse. He is out. I just needed confirmation that I wasn't over reacting.", "created_utc": 1690758488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dzh3p/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out_when_he_didnt_even_ask/", "score": 256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will add in my two cents on the drinking around kids; well getting wasted around them isn\u2019t smart I don\u2019t think hiding having a couple beers is smart either. It can set up a weirdness with alcohol. \n\nMy cousin who is the aunt of my second cousin has custody of her. When I was visiting a few summers ago, cousin & I cracked a beer at the family BBQ & second cousin who had never seen cousin drink was really weird about it. Treated my cousin like she was an alcoholic & was super wasted after just one beer which is all she had since shes not a big drinker. It was weird & when I asked my cuz if no one ever drank around second cuz she said no, no one ever did cause she was a kid & now she thinks it may have been a mistake to shelter her that much.", "Call the police to remove him.

He\u2019s being abusive. You have a responsibility to your children to protect them. What they are seeing in his behavior is that this is how relationships work and it\u2019s ok to be drunk, unemployed, angry and shouting at your partner and kids. Get rid of him. He\u2019s a loser and a bum. I hope your kids aren\u2019t female and start thinking this is how men treat women and that they should allow that in a relationship when they are older.", "NTA Change the locks while he is out.

He's a stereotypical narcissist and you had a lucky escape. They ALWAYS start off seemingly perfect and charming and then they turn into this when they drop the act.

You can't control the rando at the restaurant down the street who's getting drunk at 11am, but your home is *your home.* You could refuse to allow any alcohol inside at all, and that would be reasonable, because it's *your home.* \"Just don't drink in front of the kids\" is a completely typical, healthy boundary that stable, loving parents set all the time. In fact, if \"drinking in front of the kids\" goes beyond the level of \"a glass of wine with dinner\" (or equivalent), I would be worried that the parent in question isn't setting strong enough boundaries to ensure their child's safety. \n\nThat your kids' dad is an addict only makes BF's insistence on drinking around them worse. Categorically. \n\nBut for an added touch of perspective: Who can't hold off on the alcohol until the kids have gone to bed? Who shows up to a child's birthday drunk? Who tells you it's unreasonable to set limits on when they drink *while they're a guest in your home?* \n\n***An alcoholic.*** That's who.", "I think I have the same broken picker...", "I want better for my babies.
