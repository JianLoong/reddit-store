She was just willing to throw away your friendship for this guy and obviously has stuff she needs to work through. You didn't do anything wrong. She has shown how easy it was to throw away your friendship and how little she cares about you and your wedding. Do not offer her the moh role again.

Nice try on your gotcha moment tho.", "People sometimes need to drop out of bridal parties.  It doesn\u2019t matter why.  It\u2019s kind and respectful to give notice to the folks who are marrying if you are no longer able to fulfill the obligation you agreed to, and it\u2019s customary to offer to attend as a guest instead.  We don\u2019t have to like or agree with her reasoning.  It was very naive for the friend to request a change to how the bridal party walked out.  I get the sense that, between that request and her poor sense of boundaries with her boyfriend, she\u2019s very inexperienced in life.  But she wasn\u2019t demanding a change at that point or dangling the friendship over OP\u2019s head.  She was explaining why she would need to drop out.

And when they set clear boundaries you should respect them.\n\nI suspect if you took her up on her offer of not being in the bridal party she likely would have just caved and you'd still be friends.", "ESH - if this was a story about her complaining about walking down the aisle with an ex, the comments would be YTA.  Your bestfriend is prioritizing her boyfriend who does sound controlling,  You were not being disrespectful and you don\u2019t need to change your plans.  When you advised your plans would not change, she did request to come as just a guest as a compromise.

This isn\u2019t years down the road where she\u2019s exhausted every avenue of supporting this friend.  This is essentially a new relationship that appears to be veering into toxicity and OP just threw in the towel. To each their own.  I wouldn\u2019t throw away my best friend of 9 years over this and I definitely would not use the justification that being my MOH was a frigging privilege.  I am lucky to be part of loving, long term and mutually supportive friendships without abandoning one another at the first sign one of us were headed in a dark direction."]}
