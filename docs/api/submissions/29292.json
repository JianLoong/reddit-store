She ruined your friendship over this!\n\nYou say they are no longer together, sounds like she dodged a bullet.", "No, your good. \nFor someone she is not even married to, asking you to accommodate his religion is too much. If he has a problem with what she does, they should have worked it out between themselves. She could have respectfully declined the honor and explained the circumstances if it was really an issue, rather than imposing his wishes on your wedding.", "NTA. She took her new BF's side over your 9 year relationship. Also, her now ex was using religion as a cover for his possessive and controlling behavior (especially considering they did bits together, which I'm fairly certain wouldn't be allowed for newly dating couples if the religion was that strict).", "NTA and she chose a walking red flag for a BF. \nCut her loose, and enjoy your wedding.\n\nBest of luck OP.", "NTA.  It's your wedding, not hers.  She has no business demanding that you change a long-standing custom to appease her boyfriend's religious beliefs, especially in light of the fact that they already \"*happily do bits*.\"  That's just hypocritical.", "Nta.\n\nCan\u2019t stand \u201creligious\u201d people that use that religion as an excuse to be controlling or stop others from doing things but they\u2019re happy to break any and all the rules when it suits them \ud83d\ude12 follow all the rules and not just what suits you or fuck right off.\n\nThey also forget their religion prohibits THEM, not others, from doing certain things", "NTA\n\nShe was clearly involved with a controlling AH...\n\n>She then told me that I\u2019m disrespectful that I\u2019m not being respectful to his religion and that it is causing them to break up.\n\nHow is this your fault???\n\n>She thinks that I should have changed my wedding plans because of her boyfriend she had known for 5 months (they are no longer together)\n\nSounds like youre better off without her.", "So this man was manipulating your friend. It can be a powerful thing. I can\u2019t decide if the problem was her or him but the fact she went along with such nonsense is not your problem. You were right to remove her from the wedding NTA", "Boy, some religious beliefs are bizarre. NTA.", "NTA But it also sounds like your friend could have a controlling partner. You should keep an eye on her as that sort of thing can escalate to abuse", "So let me get this straight...\nA bf she's known for 5 months comes between your 9 year relationship and she doesn't see the red flags that is clearly happening? \nControlling behaviour\nJealousy behaviour \nUsing religion as a scape goat\nGetting between a long standing friendship only after months of dating. \n\nWtf?! \nYou probably did her a favour breaking them up because he's clearly too immature and controlling to be in an adult relationship.\n\nNTA, I'm just sorry how much this ruined your friendship xxx", "NTA , in any way .

Your friend\u2019s relationship sounds doomed but it\u2019s really none of your business. She offered to not be in the wedding anymore and she could\u2019ve still attended as a guest. I don\u2019t see why that would be a problem, your wedding day is about you. That being said if you don\u2019t want her at your wedding and you\u2019re willing to lose your friend over it then so be it.

Realise that you are NOT the asshole.", "YTA. Your good friend said that she couldn't be in the bridal party for personal reasons but she wanted to attend, so you told her to fuck off, don't come at all.  Wow, overreact much?
