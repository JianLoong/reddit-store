Also, on mobile so bare with me.\n\n\nHey guys ! I just saw a similar post a couple of h ago and it made me wanna share my story too. \n\nI ( F31) never liked cats. I'm a dog kind of person  and I could never seem to make myself like a cat. However though, a year or so ago I found a baby kitten outside my apartment and since it was raining and cold I knew I had to take her in. I guess I somehow started to like my new friend cause a couple of weeks after that I discovered that she had an almost lethal illness ( don't remember the name, vet said it was the worst illness a cat can have). Since I took her in and made her a member of the family I decided to take the responsibility and paid A LOT of money to have her hospitalised and for her to get the best treatment and survive. Which she did and I was happy about it. I never had any experience with cats though and I cannot get used to her behaviour. I've had her for like a year now and she still scratches me, bites me, she refuses to be pet or touched which is fine by me. Thing is she is constantly attacking me and my child out of complete nowhere. We have bites and scratches all over us. On top of that, for the last couple of months she decided she was done using the litter for pooping and she is doing it all over the house, bathtub, carpets, you name it. We changed her litter, her clay, she just refuses to use it. And before anyone says anything, I work from home and clean her litter every time she uses it so it's not dirty. Thing is all this behaviour made me realized I never even liked cats to begin with. I don't regret taking her in but I just feel like I can't keep her anymore. So I'm thinking of rehoming her with my parents. They have a closed terrace and agreed to take her in and keep her there. I feel guilty af but at this point I feel it's the only option that I have.  I did what I could to make myself like her and accept the bites, scratches, poop all over the place, but I just can't. I never pictured myself having a cat, she just happend to be outside my apartment and I guess it was faith for me to take her in and cure her.\n\nI know Reditors love cats so I need an honest opinion on this.

You are not irresponsible for admitting this situation is not working out/you're in over your head. \n\nAlso, the cat is clearly not happy in your home. if you have a young child i would bet a fair bit of money that's why. Cats very often do not like kids (do not @ me, i know plenty of cats who ADORE kids! but it absolutely depends on the cat and the kid, and it is not uncommon for small unpredictable humans to make cats very anxious). all the behaviors you have described could be anxiety-motivated. \n\nso yes PLEASE rehome the cat. It sounds like your parents have a very good setup, and two older adults would probably be a much better home for the cat anyway. \n\nYou would only be the A H if you just dumped the cat, which you clearly are not.", "Nta.

(Which is why TNR -- Trap, Neuter, Release -- is a thing).\n\nAs an alternative to your parents, you may want to check to see if you can give her to a local rescue society that has the skills to make her a bit less feral.", "NTA. You took her in (and saved her life by the sound of it) and you\u2019re not abandoning or dumping her anywhere, you\u2019ve sourced her a new and trustworthy home.", "NTA. You were very kind to help her and give her shelter. The best thing you can do for her, yourself, and your kid is to rehome her. Her behavior suggests that she is also uncomfortable with the living situation,  and it\u2019s possible that she will be happier and act out less in another home.", "NTA sounds like you have everyone\u2019s best interest in mind. That cat is not happy in your home and is letting you know. It may require some fostering to be better socialized and you can\u2019t have an animal that hurts you or your child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe a farm can take the cat instead?", "NTA.  But don't give her to your parents if they are just going to leave her on the terrace and ignore her.  Cats need love too.  Try to find her a home where they actually want her.", "NTA\n\nHopefully she got fixed at the vet. That can help aggresion and litter box issues. If there are lots of strays in the area, that can cause litter box issues.  Some cats are also much more playful than others. Some of the attacks you mentioned sounds like attempts at play. If figuring out her issues is too much for you and there's a new home she can go to, there's nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. You\u2019re clearly in an uncomfortable position and as long as your parents are willing to interact with her as she does need attention it would be fine.\n\nNow, onto the cat\u2019s behaviour.\n\nThe biting and scratching are likely because she was very young when you found her and was never taught how to behave by her mother or littermates. It\u2019s something that you needed to teach her when she was a kitten but you didn\u2019t know so you\u2019re not to blame at all. You could teach her now but it takes a fair bit of time and attention with an older cat.\n\nThe pooping in different places could be one of two things. Either it\u2019s medical, or it\u2019s in response to stress. It could be that she\u2019s just as unhappy with the living arrangements as you are. You should get the vet to check her for the medical aspect.\n\nIf you wanted to take one last shot without the training aspect, those calming plug-ins might help.\n\nEdited to add \n\nUsing a water bottle and spraying the cat is a bad idea. Do you really want to add stress to an already stressed animal?", "Nta. You did what you were meant to do at the time and now your work is done. She was a rescue that you fostered until she returned to good health, you\u2019re a good human so don\u2019t beat yourself up. The fact that, despite your disposition towards cats you still took it in speaks volumes. I\u2019ve had several friends who\u2019ve had to re-home pets that started getting aggressive with their child. I love animals but I will never choose a pet over my child\u2019s safety. You\u2019re doing the right thing by finding an home/environment that is best for everyone\u2019s mental health (including the cat).", "Nta I joke I have demon kitty, but he doesn\u2019t bite me and scratch me out of nowhere. Yea he does when I harass him and kiss his little kitty head. He\u2019s not big on being petted. However my senior cat will come sit on my lap and love on me on his terms only. Lol both are good cats\u2026demon kitty is weird but he\u2019s good.", "NTA. I am a cat person, but I do recognize that some cats develop behaviourmental issues for whatever reason, and what you are describing is not safe for you or your children. And an animal should never be in a home, where it is not wanted. The question is, if the cat will do any better at your parents' place, but it is worth a try.", "INFO What steps have you taken to correct her behavioral issues?", "NTA. yours and your child's safety comes first. if the cats being aggressive now, it's only a matter of time til she becomes fully aggressive and potentially puts you or your child in the hospital.", "No. Animal shelters in my country are a joke. I may be pissed at her for constantly attacking me but I still want her to be safe and taken care of.", "Really ? I just assumed it's how she is. The vet said the bitting and scratching will end at around 10-11 months so I just waited for it to end lol. She hates being pet which I'm fine with it. But sometimes i watch tv, like super chill on the couch and she just comes out of nowhere and bites me. I don't get it really.", "I hate to hear that about your Animal Shelters. But, I understand. \n\nWhere I live (Kentucky, US), Animal Shelters can range from horribly bad to \"can I be a cat\" good -- with no rhyme or reason as to the variation.\n\nIt sounds like your are taking the cat's best interests into account along with your family's. That's something to be commended.", "yeah it's time to give her up then. I've had plenty of cats and yeah biting will eventually pass but not with proper training. Like spray her in the face with a water bottle to show her \"I don't like when you do this, don't do this to me\". It also depends on how young your child is, if he's very young you don't want to risk him really setting her off and her completely going insane on him. I still have scars from a cat scratching my forearms years later.", "Wow thank you for this info ! My daughter is 2yo so pretty young. I never had a cat so I am not used with their behaviour. I just assumed she's more of a rebel and not into humans much. But if you say there's a chance her behaviour will escalate, it makes even more sense now for her to go."]}
