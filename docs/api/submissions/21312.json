She is the rude one. You are her coworker, not her therapist. You are allowed to establish boundaries about conversation topics.", "NTA \nI also feel that sometimes people just suck you into the conversations tightknit or not.\nGood that you set the boundary since these kind of conversations I only imagine having with someone who's super close to you. These things usually come out in the extremely vulnerable moments/ during one of those deepshit talks since it requires being vulnerable, i.e  in a different setting than you were in\nSo NTA", "NTA You are aloud to stop a conversation if you are uncomfortable.", "So she just walked up to you and randomly started talking about her weight gain and snack spending habits?", "No way, NTA. She was rude, and that\u2019s so inappropriate of her.  Personally I\u2019d never hang out with coworkers.  Very bad idea.  She can go to HR and make lies on you.", "NTA. It is strange to come up to a coworker and start giving personal information like that. I think it\u2019s fine to say you aren\u2019t comfortable with the conversation in order to end it because, to be blunt, I\u2019ve found that people like that don\u2019t take subtle. Especially if alcohol is involved. \n\nI\u2019ve had a very similar conversation like this myself, but I couldn\u2019t get out of it because the person was a regulator and in a position of significant authority over both me and my company. So I was stuck listening to her for 45 minutes.", "NTA", "NTA. The conversation made you uncomfortable, and you told her. That\u2019s completely fine, and it\u2019s not rude.", "NTA. You could have handled it a little smoother, but it\u2019s a minefield of a topic that she brought up and you could\u2019ve easily ended up in a world of shit at your job if you said the wrong thing.", "Definitely NTA, and honestly, I'm not sure if there is any way it could have been handled that would not have ended up with her being butthurt. Some people seem to thrive on that kind of thing.", "i\u2019m leaning on nta, she shouldn\u2019t trauma dump like that, but, she is obviously struggling with this fact and it\u2019s sad, maybe it\u2019s a cry for help?", "She probably just felt she could confide in you.", "NTA.\n\nDrunk people say wild things, it\u2019s smart not to engage as it\u2019s a coworker and there\u2019s no telling how she\u2019d perceive any response you gave her.\n\n\u201cYou gained that much weight? Ffs!! Chill out on the snacks\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Im sorry to hear that. You might need to talk to someone professionally.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? Have you tried Tziki\u2019s, the blue packs? They\u2019re delicious.\u201d\n\nYou handled it fine.", "She overstepped for sure but I would have handled it with more diplomacy. Instead of calling her out on it overtly I would have refocused the conversation to something lighter which is a more gentle way of letting her know you're not comfortable. And if you can develop that skill, because it is a skill, it will serve you well in all kinds of situations.", "NAH\n\nBut I am very confused how such a bland conversation rattled you, but I guess you are entitled to just ask people not to talk to you about whatever you dont like to hear if you wish, seems counter to your goal of getting on with people though.", "YTA\n\nThis is just such a mundane conversation, yet you're rattled and uncomfortable? Maybe it's an INFO thing, but this is more of a social interaction problem on your end.", "Some of this depends on *exactly* what she said and how, as well as the relationship you do have with this person. I can see it making you uncomfortable, but I can also see it being not wildly inappropriate to share with a work friend in some cases, if it\u2019s the type you\u2019d go to a bar with. I don\u2019t like work setups like this at all personally, but it\u2019s not like she shared a huge taboo. \n\nINFO: how close are you and this person (like do you tell personal stories) and what exactly made you uncomfortable about this?", "NTA - Honestly sounds like she was trying to gain you pity or sympathy. Either she wanted that for her own personal needs, or she was trying to use it to get something from you probably.", "NTA. Your response was fine, not everyone wants to share or hear about their coworkers personal issues, and I think it\u2019s imperative to set that boundary. If you find your relationship in the office is strained, you might take her aside and just tell her, you are uncomfortable, sharing, or receiving coworkers personal information, and you were surprised by her openness about your personal issues. You didn\u2019t mean to hurt hurt feelings, but would prefer to keep conversations on a professional level.", "NTA\n\nYou have a reasonable position. TMI about anything so personal with a coworker can make the workplace uncomfortable. Whether it was the alcohol or just poor judgment, her bringing up something so intimate and physical as her weight struggles without first checking in to see if you were ok with the subject put you automatically in a bad position. Like, what if she said that to someone who was recovering from an eating disorder, and it triggered them? You set the boundary you needed to set, as politely as possible given the situation. If you had just drifted off without saying anything directly, she might have then considered you as her \u201cphysical and intimate details buddy\u201d at work and started bringing it up more often, or bringing up equally personal things. If this had been about something else equally physical and intimate, such as sex, you would be within your rights to set a boundary. So even though she didn\u2019t like your boundary, you did the right thing to set it, and the next step would be to bring it to HR if she tries again.", "NTA. At my workplace I never mention or discuss anything about a coworker's physical appearance. You were upfront and honest about being uncomfortable with Molly's trama dump. Also, you missed out on a free jizz if you didn't realize it. This was her pathetic way of offering to spread her legs for even the smallest of complements on her looks or sympathy with her plight.", "Nta, you handled it better than I would a trauma dump from a coworker all the sudden", "YTA she is clearly struggling mentally and needs some help or maybe just someone to talk to. You could\u2019ve been a bit more gentle with her", "YTA\n\nI think you could have just given them generic spiel about how people loose weight, dieting, working out etc. \n\nI get you were taken a bit of guard it seems but I honestly don't see why it made you feel uncomfortable. Also again generic weigh loss spiel would have protected your relationship with co worker a bit more than you did. \n\nThey were making themselves vulnerable and all they probably needed was some light advice or a compliment.", "NTA", "She wants you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We're like a 4. If we talk it's like, \" Did you watch this show? Did you see that movie? Big vacation plans?\". So, we aren't strangers, but, I would never pour feelings out to her. What made it uncomfortable was just how gloomy she made it.

Not fully drunk but drunk enough to lower her inhibitions.", "Oooh, that explains a lot. Yeah, NTA, lol.", "How odd indeed. NTA. She was probably fishing for compliments or reassurance or something.", "Yeah. I got everything from her lithium prescription to why she doesn\u2019t need a man because she has a dog to how much she hated my boss. It was excruciating.

Different topic, but same type of \u201canything I can say can be misinterpreted because it\u2019s a sensitive topic\u201d. Thankfully it was while I was waiting for the microwave in the break room so I had a smoother way out than you did.\n\nYou might still offer an apology because it does seem like you hurt her feelings a bit.

I'm sure everyone else at the company is sick of it and no longer gives her any sympathy. If you hadn't pushed back, you would have become her emotional dumping ground for the next couple of months.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "I think you are a little TA for wanting to only hear problems with solutions (like that attitude is a little toxic, in a common way). It should not require her have a plan to \u201cdo\u201d something or that shouldn\u2019t impact one way or the other. That\u2019s something just for your own interpersonal skills I\u2019d check in yourself as at any possible ideas about weight coming into play here, BUT I think NTA simply because all you said was that you were uncomfortable with the particular topic (assuming that\u2019s all you said and you seemed I try to say it diplomatically too) AND you\u2019re just not that close. If you were closer and commonly talked about personal feelings and experiences (which some coworkers might, though I get many do not\u2014I don\u2019t with coworkers either) that would be different.
