There is a lot of history and background in this living situation, but I'll try to keep is short.

Everytime we would bring an issue we were having with him (things in terms of cleaning or doing his share of the work) or things he's said that we're rude or upsetting, we would get the work around. \"I never said that\" or \"that literally never happened.\" There has also been times that he has been caught in his lies but try his best to deny it or gaslight us further. \n\nThese are the events that lead to the camera situation. My fiancee has a lot of trust issues about people (especially men, due to previous traumas) being in her private space. There has also been a history of him specifically blaming her for all the problems in the house, and accusing her of being abusive based off a list of senseless things. Because of all this history she really doesn't trust him, and there has been a lot of tension. \n\nMy brother and I were arguing, and we brought up that he used my fiancee and I's ensuite bathroom and soaker tub while we were gone on vacation when we had specifically told him no. \n\n She left a kernel of cat food in the tub around the drain, so that the minute the water is turned on it will wash it down because she didn't trust that he would respect our no. \n\nSo during this argument when it was brought up, I said that we were certain he used the tub when we were gone because\u00a0 my fiancee \"left something behind\" so that she'd know if he used the tub even though we said no. This made him pissed off, and then accused us of having a secret camera not only in our room but around the house in general, to spy on him. \n\nWhere I may be the asshole is that I didn't deny a camera being in our bedroom (but I also didn't say there was one) I said having a camera in our room is not a problem, it's in the privacy of our own room where no one else should be. I did this because I knew that if he assumed there were cameras he would tell the truth as he'd be caught red-handed and he can't say that it never happened because the assumption would be that we actively have evidence from the camera footage.\n\nHe did end up admitting to using the bath and once he admitted to using the bath I told him there are no cameras in our bedroom or anywhere else.

How violated is she going to feel if she thinks she\u2019s been recorded in the bath without her permission?
