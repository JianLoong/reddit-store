It's not shaming her for her bodily functions so much as the lack of consideration for others by bleeding onto surfaces outside of her home. Yeah, period underwear should be a clear solution here. But otherwise, she should be bring towel or something to sit on if she's going to be in your homes, in school, on a bus, etc, and bleeding over other people's belongings and public property.", "Was all prepared to call you an AH at the start.

Only speaking common sense!", "NTA!!!!! I can\u2019t say it enough. It sounds like you were really gentle and understanding with her when it happened. But yeah\u2026 obviously it\u2019s not okay to get your blood all over someone\u2019s furniture. Couches are expensive! It\u2019s like\u2026 yeah pooping is also a normal bodily function, but you can\u2019t just take a shit on someone\u2019s couch.

Period bleeding is completely normal, bleeding on other people's furniture is not. Her parents are setting this girl up for disaster. People are going to hate her for it. But the whole issue has gone political, because a group of people think that bleeding on other people's property is trendy. Personally I think it is disgusting.

That\u2019s incredibly disrespectful.", "YTA x 100000 you shamed a child for things completely beyond her control.  Way to go asshat.", "ESH\n\nI wonder if her parents are using free bleeding as a way to avoid having to buy her hygiene products. Does her mother free bleed without underwear or menstrual cups?\n\n> What she doing in public places, where people supposed to seat after?\n\nYou're scolding a kid for an attitude her parents have pounded into her and over which she's not had any exposure to outside ideas. This is like a kid who's raised in an ultra-conservative, ultra-christian household being scolded for not knowing what a period is, because their family never taught her due to how 'corrupting' and 'sinful' the mere existence of sex is. \n\nYou did shame her, and you shamed her for something she had no control over, and for something she'd been, in essence, brainwashed to believe. It's not like schools discuss free bleeding in health class. And that's assuming she goes to a school that has a health class, or her parents have given her permission to attend. \n\nYou make it sound like she maliciously bled on your couch. She didn't. She simply did what her parents had taught her to do. It's not her fault her parents failed to teach her correctly. She's as much a victim of their idiot mentality as your couch is. \n\nYou owe the girl an apology for how you spoke to her, and her parents owe you whatever the cost of getting your couch dry cleaned.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's one thing to practice personal beliefs in your own home, but it's a whole different kettle of fish when those practices impact others, especially in their own homes. Bleeding on someone else's furniture is not on, and it's fair dinkum that you were shocked and disgusted.\n\nYour response was pretty reasonable under the circumstances. You acknowledged that menstruation is normal, but you also pointed out the need for respect and consideration when in someone else's space. Offering period underwear as a solution was a thoughtful gesture too.\n\nIt's a bit rough that her parents would react by accusing you of shaming their daughter and kicking up a stink at the school. It sounds like they're being a bit self-centred and inconsiderate. Unfortunately, you can't control how other people react, but you can stand by your values of respect and cleanliness in your own home.\n\nRegarding your daughter and her association with this family, it's important to support her in navigating these social dynamics. If things escalate or if there's ongoing drama at school, documenting your concerns and communicating with the school is a wise move.\n\nAt the end of the day, you did what any reasonable person would do in that situation.

People are not supposed to handle other people's blood/fluids, as many things can be transmitted through those fluids. Not saying this child has any diseases, but in general it's not safe to handle other people's blood. Katy will eventually have to deal with this a lot better, and her parents are setting her up for a big fat fail here. Of course peers at Katy's school will eventually pick on her - kids this age can be so cruel.   \n\n\nPlus blood stains are not always removable. Parents are the AHs here.
