You sound like a wonderful thoughtful and interesting human being. The Catholic Church is not against tattoos. In our church the mean lady who ran the confirmation program had a big one on her back shoulder. So she was as mean and strict as a Confirmation lady might be bit she had a visible tat in the church.", "NTA. I got married in a Catholic church and I have a tattoo. Your mom is being ridiculous.", "Does your mother realise that she is trying way to hard to impress some people? What does she thinks what's going to happen if they see your tattoos?

I think the tattoo taboo is a generation thing.", "NTA. You're 24, and your mother cannot control you. This makes her upset, the fact that she can't control you. Read into this. Talk to your mother about this. \n\nAlso, talk to your sister and find out how she feels. Personally, if my sibling married into an ultra conservative religious family, I would be respectful and suck it up for one day.

(if you're not a in the wedding and wearing the specific bridesmaid dress make sure you get one that matches in a similar but not the same style or color) if your dress can cover some of the tattoo great, if not oh-well.\n\nif you have some very offensive tattoos, you should find a way to cover those up for the day (you probably don't want to put on display your tattoo of the devil doing perverted things to the virgin Mary when the grooms a Catholic, LOL)\n\nI doubt that the groom is going to call off the wedding to your sister when he sees that you have tattoos.", "NTA. Your mum is being ridiculously controlling and judgemental. What does she think will happen? Are they going to call the whole thing off becauae his sister-in-law has tattoos? It is your body. You don't have to wear anything you don't want to.\n\nThe more I come here the more I realise how lucky I was to have my parents. I was a goth child when it was not a common thing.

If it was her wedding, then maybe. If you were a child or teenager, then maybe.

Are you expected to cover the ratios just for the wedding? Or does your mom have the expectation that you will cover the tattoos whenever these in-laws are around? Because I don\u2019t think that is sustainable.", "NTA . You\u2019re right. It\u2019s your sister\u2019s wedding. Not hers. She doesn\u2019t get to choose your attire. Not even if you\u2019re in the wedding party. Then, it is your sister\u2019s choice. If you\u2019re not in the wedding party then it\u2019s mildly your sister\u2019s decision based on if she sets a dress code that all guests are asked to follow. Such as formal, black tie. Etc. if she does, you still have a lot of choices that allow you to choose what to wear that meets the criteria. Your mom should not and does not have the right to decide what you wear. \n\nBut, here\u2019s a suggestion if you\u2019re willing to compromise, hire a professional makeup artist who specializes in airbrush makeup and cover them for the day. \n\nI use my Dinair airbrush makeup to cover mine pretty regularly. It\u2019s Great coverage and lasts all day and night. Easy to touch up if you need to.", "NTA. It's not your mother's wedding, it's your sisters.
