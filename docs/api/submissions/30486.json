She was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease after they divorced. \n\nex SIL was a SAHM with a part time job while the boys were at school. John makes a comfortable mid six figures. SIL had to move out of our city to a town about 2 hours away since our city is pretty unaffordable.\n\nWhen John divorced his wife, my ex SIL, he got full custody of my nephews Nick and Nate (in their late teens). I thought she would fight for at least part custody. When I talked to her, ex SIL said she couldn\u2019t justify making her boys unhappy by ripping them away from their comfortable life to live in a one bedroom apartment when she physically couldn\u2019t get up some days. I understood. She keeps in touch with the kids and talks with them as often as they want.\n\nI was talking with my nephews when Nick mentioned how annoyed he was that his last summer (his junior year) would be wasted at his mom\u2019s (ex SIL, his bio mom). He didn\u2019t want to do it. I was confused and asked what they were talking about. Apparently, they thought that they would be living with ex SIL for the summer but with my brother for the school year. John hadn\u2019t corrected them. \n\nSo I told them that their mom (ex SIL) didn\u2019t have any custody and they would be spending the summer with their dad, my brother. I thought they would cheer up when I told them but they got very quiet. They haven\u2019t talked me since even though I tried to reach out. \n\nMy brother said I shouldn\u2019t have blurted it out and that I overstepped my boundaries. He was going to tell them gently. Because of me, my nephews are upset. AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t know it was a secret and didn\u2019t think it was a big deal since the boys were unhappy about staying there in the first place.

They are in their late teens which means they are about to understand what\u2019s going on and have their own thoughts and feelings about the divorce and custody. \n\nYou are the AH for how you talk about your SIL here. What do you mean by calling her \u201clazy\u201d because it sounds a lot like you\u2019re blaming her for your brother having an affair. Cheaters are going to cheat and he would have always found an excuse. \nShe had a medical problem, her husband cheated and got divorced, she\u2019s struggling to make ends meet, is disabled, from the sounds of it feels guilty she can\u2019t take care of the kids because of her disability and gave up custody because of it likely doesn\u2019t have any support network. Try having some empathy.", "Sorry, the last part seems confusing the way you wrote it\u2026 your nephews thought they were staying with their bio mom? You broke the news that dad has full custody?", "ESH. He should have been honest with his sons, and you shouldn't have said anything when you realized they were unaware of the full details.", "NAH except your brother.", "Soft YTA, I know you didn't mean anything bad by it. But. You overstepped, it wasn't your place to correct them and tell them that.", "Soft YTA, I think it was an honest mistake on your part. You probably didn't think of the consequences. But if you realized that they didn't know, you should have automatically thought that they didn't know for a reason. It wasn't something for you to share. \n\nTBH, your brother does seem like a good husband. He left his sick wife because of a lame reason not prioritizing the family. Your SIL was good enough to think of their kids needs infront of her own. Something he didn't do. Even though the kids don't have custody rights, they should live with the mother from time to time when they want to visit.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t know the custody terms were still a secret, and as the boys are teenagers and not small children it\u2019s not really a logical assumption that they wouldn\u2019t know.\n\nIn hindsight you probably should have just said you weren\u2019t sure that was correct and they should confirm their living situation with their dad.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad they were surprised about it this way, but it doesn\u2019t make you TA.", "YTA. Wasn't your place to say anything. If I were in your shoes, and I heard my nephew make that comment, I wouldve contacted ex SIL and/or brother and let them know that the kids still think they're gonna live with their mom for the summer and they should be informed of the changes. Wasn't your place to correct them.", "YTA if you \u201cthough it would be a nice surprise\u201d then you should have let their dad tell them.", "Kids have a tendency to complain about everything, it means very little. \n\nBut there's a difference between them not wanting to stay and them not being wanted. By u saying they aren't staying with their mom, they r probably thinking she doesn't want them. So now they are experiencing abandonment issues & probably don't know how to handle it.", "YTA lose lips sink ships. You should have ran past this by your brother. As for your nephews they were probably putting a show on. So they can party for the summer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s why I put in quotes (because my brother complained that she was). If anything, she probably did too much and spoiled the boys. Their grades have gone downhill the past year. I really liked my ex SIL and she still is part of my family.", "Yeah, they thought they were staying with their bio mom and I told them they weren\u2019t. They would stay with their dad, my brother, full time.", "I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal since they were unhappy about staying at their mom\u2019s.

Maybe they\u2019re mad at John for hiding it from them idk", "You might want to show her some support then. With SIL so far away from her kids, making sacrifices to try and give them everything in the background I\u2019d be worried that the kids are only hearing dad\u2019s side of things and might be blaming her for the divorce. \nI\u2019m curious about how much they know about what happened if he didn\u2019t tell them she doesn\u2019t have custody. I know personally if one of my parents cheated I\u2019d be furious them.\nIf John isn\u2019t talking with them about what\u2019s going on or is throwing SIL under the bus it might be with it to cross boundaries so the boys don\u2019t think their mom gave up on them or abandoned them.", "You may not think she is lazy but you did blame her for your brother cheating. By the way you talk you seem to have the mind set its ok to cheat and its was her fault.", "Custody is a big deal whether they're happy about it or not. You seem to think that this is only a problem because they were upset. \n\nIt's never your place to inform someone else's children about their custody arrangement. Never.", "I get it,  I do. Better way to handle it would have been to let it drop and bring it up with your brother. He could have filled you in as to why they didn't know yet.", "It was a big deal to both your brother and the kids. You have changed your relationship with your brother and now you will have to live with it.", "Sounds like even if they don\u2019t want to spend much time at her house, they want to feel like their mom wants them there.", "I get it. They\u2019re kids so they don\u2019t need to know the details but they know that John fell out of love with her and with his coworker. His new wife did bribe them with gifts and things before they were officially together which I don\u2019t approve of. They know ex SIL has an illness and that she isn\u2019t allowed to drive a car for medical reasons but they don\u2019t know how bad.", "I read it as that's her brother's excuse, but op disagreed.", "You said they\u2019re in their late teens (I\u2019m assuming 16 and up),personally I think that\u2019s old enough to understand the concepts of affairs and cheating. Regardless they\u2019re going to be able to figure it out eventually. \n\nI think they really ought to be informed about how bad her disease is, even in general. If there\u2019s complications from it and she passes away they\u2019re going to wish they had spent that time with her. At the very least knowing it\u2019s severe might help them understand that she would be their for them if she could. \n\nAs a side note:autoimmune disease are often genetic so your brother might want to take them to do some screening/be aware and keep an eye out for early signs.", "You need to talk to your brother and ex-SIL. Autoimmune diseases tend to run in families, and your nephews have a right to know so they can look out for symptoms. Early diagnosis is often critical for preserving quality of life", "That part they should be told.", "Both of their parents agree that it\u2019s not the time to be telling them of ex SIL\u2019s diagnosis. They\u2019re in their sophomore and junior year and have to focus on getting into a good college, especially since ex SIL\u2019s not around to help them with everything. Their grades have gotten pretty bad and as someone in the industry, it\u2019s more competitive than ever.\n\nThey\u2019ve gotten checked up and they\u2019re above average in health even for teenage boys.", "That makes sense. Just try to be supportive where you can and keep an eye on what\u2019s going down. While it\u2019s important to respect boundaries sometimes you gotta put the kids well being first even if the parents don\u2019t agree. \nI have a younger cousin who came out to me as bisexual and I\u2019ve made sure to be supportive and a resource if they need one. Her sister and parents are extremely religious and homophobic and they are vocal about it. I know how damaging that can be so I\u2019ve made sure she knows she can come to me for help or information even though I know they would be furious if they ever found out. Some things are worth crossing lines for.", "Well then sit down with them and help them get their grades up. \n   Sounds like their dad doesn't do that stuff.", "ehm. how is any of that your fault? like any? poor ex SIL\n\nNTA", "I can\u2019t even vote on your behavior regarding telling the kids because Im so appalled at how you just seem so cool with what a jerk your brother and his new wife are. \n\nHoly shit, gifts to the kids to soften them up before he left his ex wife? Hiding the details of his affair to alienate his ex sick wife? Not telling the kids how sick THEIR MOTHER is. Gross gross gross. \n\nIs he going to tell them when she dies? Or is he going to lie to them about that too. You are such an AH for being so unbothered by what your brother has done. I\u2019d be telling those boys all about how their mom is chronically ill and your brothers affair. They\u2019re in high school they\u2019re not little kids. Shame on all of you.", "Sorry but this is the creepiest shit I've ever read - why are you making excuses for your brother cheating on his sick wife and then divorcing her? Your family sounds pretty gross tbh", "NAH\n\nHow were you to know that they didn't tell their older teens the custody arrangements?  It's not like the are 4 and 6.\n\nUnless you were specifically told not to tell them... why would not correct a misconception like that?  It shouldn't be a big secret.\n\nI'm also confused why they don't know their mom's diagnosis.  They probably think worse of her for not having custody because now they think she never wanted them rather than struggling to care for them.", "Is SIL getting any kind of support from the brother? You don\u2019t usually see the lower wage spouse getting nothing. She lives in a one bdrm?", "Nah", "YTA\n\nMaybe not completely intentionally but you should have been able to pick up cues from the way the kids reacted that they didn't have all the information you gave them.", "What was he gonna do?  Wait for the summer and then tell the kids their mother couldn't be bothered taking them because she's so lazy?  \n\nHow dare you ruin his chances to make her out to be an uncaring mother. /s", "ESH - your attitude towards your ex SIL is nasty and judgmental", "Sorry but rule number 1 when you expect someone to lie for you is to inform them what they're meant to lie about. Bro failed in doing that as much as he failed as a husband and a father.", "Also the fact she has an autoimmune disease. Quite often the symptom of these is lack of energy\u2026 aka \u201claziness\u201d apparently\u2026.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH; I would\u2019ve thought they would have known this already as well. But it does seem like they need to know what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m a little surprised they haven\u2019t figured it out, but it also seems like the whole family is treating them like they\u2019re 6 instead of 16. How much is it going to change for them to know *why* things are the way they are, at least as far as their mom being sick? It sounds like they got quiet because they think their mom doesn\u2019t want them at all since she moved away and has no custody of them; wouldn\u2019t it make sense to let them know she\u2019s ill and doesn\u2019t want to disrupt their lives? Also, it might be nice if you all to help her brainstorm a couple of fun but affordable weekends with the boys so they don\u2019t feel guilty for not seeing her at all. Right now, it looks like your brother swore for better or for worse, but cheated on her while she was sick (though I get that he didn\u2019t know she had a disease when he did) and now he\u2019s living it up with his affair partner, six figure job and the children his ex birthed. Meanwhile his ex had to move into a one bedroom and give up her kids so she can struggle to get through the day without disrupting their happiness. I mean it\u2019s not your family\u2019s fault that she\u2019s sick but she\u2019s getting an incredibly sad deal. (Out of curiosity, is his coworker also younger and thinner and has never given birth?)", "So why won't any of you tell the kids the truth of what happened? The new wife even bought their affections with buying them things. Isn't your brother sabotaging the relationship with their mom? He cheated on her while she was ill and manipulated the kids too. He's turning them against her. Why is your family okay with all this? And not telling them about her illness either? Seriously? None of you are helping the kids here at all. They'll resent all of you for being so dishonest to them.", "Just about everyone in my mom\u2019s side of the family has 1 serious or 2+ not as serious autoimmune diseases. I have 3. Lucky me!", "Do they really both agree, or does your sick ex SIL just not have the energy or resources to fight back? The kids are teens, not toddlers. They probably noticed that Dad got remarried awfully quick and Mom\u2019s been exiled to Brokeville. They probably suspect their Mom\u2019s problems are serious if they\u2019re preventing her from driving or visiting. And everyone is keeping them in the dark. Maybe that could be stressing them out and affecting their grades?\n\nWhen do they think it\u2019ll be a good time to break the news, anyway? Graduation? Oh no, it\u2019ll cast a pall on a happy time. College, oh no, can\u2019t distract them from their studies! But then, realistically, they\u2019re punting it until their Mom has any sort of health crisis, which sounds like could happen anytime, and then it\u2019ll all land like a bomb.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for not knowing what your brother is hiding from his kids. Frankly your brother is TA for avoiding difficult conversations with his own kids, and expecting everyone to whitewash reality for him.", "Honestly I am doubtful. This whole thing reeks of the SIL being bullied out or trying to be reasonable and trusting your brother to be honest when he isn't. \n\n\nIf you are unsure talk to the boys and check their version matches reality. If your brother practices parental alienation that is damaging to the boys. \n\nIt feels to me like you know he isn't being honest or fair but are just afraid to rock the boat to me"]}
