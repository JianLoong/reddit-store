For context. \n\nA couple days ago I was on a bus that wasn't that busy. Not empty, but there were multiple unused seats and no one had to stand. I had just gone shopping and had heavy bags that were hard to carry and hardly fit in front of my legs. \n\nSo I sat in one seat and placed my bags on the seat next to me, essentially taking up 2 seats on my own. Since it wasn't crowded when I got on I didn't see an issue and like I said the bags were super heavy and hurt to carry so I wanted to set them down. \n\nThe bus ride was kind of long and as it went on more and more people got on the bus. It eventually got pretty crowded to the point where some people had to stand up. \n\nI didn't ever move my bag or offer the seat to someone. In my experience most people don't want to sit next to strangers anyway and a lot of the time people will end up standing instead of sitting in an empty seat next to someone they don't know. Also no one said anything to me. \n\nAt the last stop (ended at the bus station where pretty much everyone was getting off) someone passive aggressively told me \"you could have moved your bag and not been inconsiderate and rude. Everyone wants to sit not just you.\" Or something along those lines. I didn't really respond because I didn't know what to say. \n\nThe person who said that never asked me to move my stuff, and if they did I probably would have. So I don't understand how I was being rude? They could have asked during the ride instead of insulting me after it was already done. Busses are also generally first come first serve so I think my behavior was normal. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Bonus points if this is a young man.", "This. I'm German, only use trains, not busses tho.

Projecting shameful behavior on those around you.", "And I\u2019m guessing OP probably also would have fumed in silence about it rather than asking someone to move their stuff like OP expected others to do. Idk about y\u2019all but if I were the person left without a seat on the bus, I would be wary of asking someone to move their stuff.

No bag should have a seat while people stand. If she wanted to stand, she should have done it WITH her bag.", "My train has backs that flip so you can have a quad. It drives me bananas how many people will flip them to sit with two people on crowded commuter trains instead of just sitting next to each other. There\u2019s a young couple on my regular train who does this and I\u2019ve just sat down in their quad with them a few times at this point since I\u2019m normally getting on as the doors are closing and it\u2019s full. I\u2019m not standing the whole way home after a long day of work.", "Well, there was 'barely room' for the bags in front of her legs. She would have been mildly uncomfortable whilst sat down as everyone else bounced and swung around her...\ud83d\ude44 OP has main character syndrome. YTA, OP.

You shouldn't need to be told to do the obviously right thing and you shouldn't need to ask people if you're in the wrong for something like this.", "Same in Norway", "Agreed!! Like I shouldn't HAVE to ask for respect. I give it to others and I expect it back. I shouldn't have to ask my neighbors to be quiet at midnight. I shouldn't have to ask someone to move their shopping cart out of blocking the aisle. I shouldn't have to ask someone to hold a door open so I can catch it as I'm going through behind them. Just like I shouldn't have to ask not to be punched in the face or stolen from or cut in front of in line. Just don't effing do it if its rude!!\n\nI hate people. Most of them are rude and self-centered and too stupid to even realize it, just like the OP of this post.", "Yes! I would be afraid of retaliation at that point.

Pretty infuriating and degrading experience for him.", "And I think everyone in the world has carried big and heavy bags and you just set them down on the floor, wtf. It's not difficult or anything.

You cant reserve seats for luggage.", "I agree, if you want to stand and have your bags in the seat, fine, you are still taking only one seat.

How you use that seat is up to you.\n\nBest-case scenario is me seated, with parcels on my lap and on the floor where I can use my feet to keep them confined. But if that's not going to work for some reason, keeping heavy packages a few feet off the floor would be worth standing for me, since I do have one good arm to brace myself with (and a surfer's ability to keep my feet under me in a moving vehicle). My standing, and resting my bags on a seat I would otherwise be sitting in, will enable me to move more quickly  when I get to my stop.\n\nWorst scenario of all, for everyone, would be me standing with heavy parcels in the aisle, at my feet, where I cannot easily shift them or keep them from sliding. If someone gets on a crowded bus and obviously needs the seat, of course, I would yield if nobody else offers. \n\nFortunately many of our local buses now have overhead racks and storage space up front where you can put some bags.", "A handicapped or elderly person needs the seat more than your groceries 100% of the time.

The driver would always stop to pick up people, and then you would have to literally shove people out of the way to stuff yourself inside because it would be thirty minutes before 3 more stuffed full busses came by.

But that\u2019s not what every person with a walker does, and generalizing and acting like it\u2019s so easy if you\u2019ve never been in their position is prejudicial.\n\nThe space required to unfold a walker is greater than the volume of the walker because of your arms and also anything that was in your arms needing to be put down so that you can have your hands free. Therefore, if you fold your walker, you require a larger radius of free space around you than if you had left it out - space that you don\u2019t have because people filled in that space with their belongings and bodies.  \n\nThen, you unfold the walker and stand up for your stop, and people in the path between you and the door have to move out of the way.

People complain about you being in their way, take it upon themselves to relocate you without consideration of and often in the opposite direction of where you were going, and will actually run to get ahead of you and then deliberately stop in your path. Apparently their convenience is justified at the expense of yours.\n\nHumans in crowds tend to be inconsiderate. They shed their sense of personal responsibility when they can blame it on others without actually pointing a finger at a specific person. Whether they do the pushing or are pushed and fall into someone, they have no remorse. So I don\u2019t fault people who must be subjected to the chaos and choose to defend themselves from it by using a barrier they are permitted to use precisely because they are more vulnerable to injury in crowds. And I don\u2019t expect those same people to do something for my convenience that will cause their inconvenience while also only delaying mine and therefore not actually making the situation better for either of us.", "I just want to say that not everyone who uses a walker is *capable* of folding/unfolding it.\n\nMy mother isn\u2019t.  \n\nSo if she\u2019s alone, it\u2019s blocking another seat or the walkway.\n\nShe\u2019d be very distressed if someone demanded she stow it and would likely hurt herself attempting to do so.  Fortunately, where she lives, most people are very understanding and compassionate about such things.", "Interesting cultural differences.\n\nIn Canada and the USA, a city bus basically has zero storage areas at all. Some of them might have an exterior bike rack on the front hood.\n\nInter-city buses would have the small overhead storage, but they also have massive storage compartments under the bus (under the floor of the bus) that are accessible from compartment doors on the outside. These compartments run the full width of the bus, side to side, and is where you'd store luggage and even larger things like skis or whatever.", "That very well could be the case.
