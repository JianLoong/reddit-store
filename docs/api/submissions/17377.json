For context. \n\nA couple days ago I was on a bus that wasn't that busy. Not empty, but there were multiple unused seats and no one had to stand. I had just gone shopping and had heavy bags that were hard to carry and hardly fit in front of my legs. \n\nSo I sat in one seat and placed my bags on the seat next to me, essentially taking up 2 seats on my own. Since it wasn't crowded when I got on I didn't see an issue and like I said the bags were super heavy and hurt to carry so I wanted to set them down. \n\nThe bus ride was kind of long and as it went on more and more people got on the bus. It eventually got pretty crowded to the point where some people had to stand up. \n\nI didn't ever move my bag or offer the seat to someone. In my experience most people don't want to sit next to strangers anyway and a lot of the time people will end up standing instead of sitting in an empty seat next to someone they don't know. Also no one said anything to me. \n\nAt the last stop (ended at the bus station where pretty much everyone was getting off) someone passive aggressively told me \"you could have moved your bag and not been inconsiderate and rude. Everyone wants to sit not just you.\" Or something along those lines. I didn't really respond because I didn't know what to say. \n\nThe person who said that never asked me to move my stuff, and if they did I probably would have. So I don't understand how I was being rude? They could have asked during the ride instead of insulting me after it was already done. Busses are also generally first come first serve so I think my behavior was normal. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684237589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j2v3g/aita_for_taking_up_2_seats_on_a_bus/", "score": 361, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do, however, agree that this is a somewhat unwinnable situation. If it is indeed as you said that there are often times when the bus is full but there are empty seats, then ideally there needs to be an agreed-upon etiquette change which shifts the burden to the standing passengers to inquire about a seat that's occupied by an object. But in the absence of such an unspoken rule, the non-asshole (even if suboptimal) thing to do is to keep the seat open.", "YTA and you should've learnt the proper public transport etiquette by now.\n\nseats are for sitting, not for putting your bags on them. it's okay to take up more than one seat when there are other empty seats available but you absolutely have to take your stuff away as soon as you see people standing due to the lack of seats.", "YTA.

I had just gone shopping and had heavy bags that were hard to carry and hardly fit in front of my legs. \n\nSo I sat in one seat and placed my bags on the seat next to me, essentially taking up 2 seats on my own. Since it wasn't crowded when I got on I didn't see an issue and like I said the bags were super heavy and hurt to carry so I wanted to set them down. \n\nThe bus ride was kind of long and as it went on more and more people got on the bus. It eventually got pretty crowded to the point where some people had to stand up. \n\nI didn't ever move my bag or offer the seat to someone.

Why bother if you don\u2019t care?", "I\u2019ve only ever seen that during Covid.", "That\u2019s their CHOICE doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not common courtesy to at least give them the option to sit down", "You don't want to accept reality,  so why are you on here?", "Maybe they\u2019re standing because people like you don\u2019t move their shit and give them a seat. YTA", "Oh my god, don\u2019t ask the internet for advice if you\u2019re not even going to take it. You\u2019re very obviously TA in this situation. You can\u2019t just assume \u201cmost people don\u2019t want to sit next to strangers\u201d. You can\u2019t read minds.", "op is not learning anything, they have only doubled down since posting.", "True it does seem to be working in this case. I just meant more the woman could have handled it differently. Not everyone checks themselves on reddit AITA forum.\n\nEdit: I take this back. It didn't solve the problem of op's bags being on the seat, but it may have prevented future occurrences of it.", "I\u2019ve literally stood whilst a person had a bag on a seat on the underground. I\u2019m the end someone else asked because I didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d react", "People shouldn\u2019t have to ask OP. You know you\u2019re the asshole in this scenario. Accept it and stop arguing.", "They shouldn\u2019t have to. Any respectful person would see the bus is getting full and empty the seat. A rude entitled person would wait until someone asked and then empty the seat.", "No one should have to ask you.  You're an adult now.  Stop waiting around for instructions like a child.", "THEY SHOULDNT HAVE TO ASK", "I never said it happens all the time. But since I've seen it happen I don't think it's made up. Doesn't excuse OP's behavior, but I just don't think they're lying since this is a common thing on busses.", "When did I ever say OP shouldn't have moved their bag?", "All I'm saying is that I've seen empty seats on overcrowded busses many times. I'm not making any assumptions about anything.", "I'm wondering if, because she's only 19, she has the idea that pandemic bus behaviour is the norm rather than an exception.", "Yeah, people do that in confrontations.  I'd bet my last dollar OP will remember this next time she's got two seats and the bus starts filling up.", "Yep. I will ask on behalf of someone else (visibly pregnant, using crutches etc) but won\u2019t for myself. \n\nEven so I got verbally abused for asking a man taking up two priority seats on a bus to move his bag so a pregnant woman (wearing the badge) could sit down.\n\nHe called me a \u2018fat selfish c***\u2019 and yelled at me for several minutes. Nobody else on the bus defended me and I ended up having to get off and wait for the next one because I was starting to cry.", "You didn't say not to do that I just think it's important to mention explicitly that OP/anyone *should* do it", "Yea so have I. But the amount of people sitting next to strangers on the busses is more than the amount of people who choose not to sit next to a stranger. All I'm saying is the majority of people want a seat. Even next to a stranger."]}
