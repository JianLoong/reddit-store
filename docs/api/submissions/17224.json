Time to say goodbye, sorry, BUT abusive and stressful and demanding!", "It really is a wonderful word, perfect for a villain admonishing his mooks for not killing off the hero.", "Hahaha, this reminds me of my mom so much. Group of us on vacation, all adults but family mix (so the youngest was maybe 22 and I'm about 28 at this time and the 'parentals' are all in their late 40s to 50s) - one of those resort places. We are at breakfast, big table, all chatting, when leader dude proposes an excursion. Out of the 12-14 of us there, 8 of us (including me) are all like \"yeah, sound great let's do it\". A few people, \"naw, I'll hang out at the pool/beach\". \n\nMy mom: \"I don't want to do that.\"\nall of us: \"Okay - natter on about details of excursion.\"\nMom: \"I Don't Want To Do That.\"\nAll of us: noddy, yah yah, natter...\nMom: I DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT\"\nAll of us: \"Okay, so ... don't go?\"\nMom: I told you I don't want to do that.\nMe: Yes, okay, so do something different.\nMom: But I don't want to go on the excursion.\nCue most of us looking super effing confused.\nOld friend of mom's: \"MomName? MOMNAME!\" (my mom turns to her and then friend enunciates like she's talking to a child: \"We are going to go on the excursion, you are not going on the excursion. You are going to do something different.\"\nMom: You are all going to go?\n10 of us nod\nMom <pause> : But I don't want to go.\n\nAt that most of us burst out laughing and just ignored her from that point on. We finally got that she literally could not understand that if she didn't like a thing, anyone else was still going to do the thing. She had ruled, why weren't we obeying!?!", "NTA. Yeah, I would ghost her after that.", "I took a beginning needlepoint class with a friend and her other friend.

Sounds to me like A will be getting fewer invites to hang out. I would distance myself from someone who claims to not be 5 years old, then throw a toddler tantrum.", "That was my first thought too, I\u2019d rather be at the beach! But A didn't even do that, or find any other way to enjoy herself.   \nThen on second thought, painting a figurine is actually a really cool souvenir from the trip! Something i made myself w/ my friends would be a special memory, better than anything otherwise store-bought. It\u2019s too bad that memory will always include A being a brat!", "I have done cross stitching since I was a kid. It's so relaxing", "NTA A sounds unpleasant to be around.", "Sounds like main character syndrome. She's the only important person in the world, so anyone else doing something she doesn't want to do is an imbecile.", "Certainly does. Rude and disrespectful.", "NTA\nA could have wandered around the shops or beach. She could have stayed and enjoyed the company while those who wanted to paint painted.\nShe instead chose self martyrdom, sitting and stewing in the car- if that's really what she did for an hour and a half. She's angry that she wasn't successful getting the group to coddle her. So, she played the martyr.\nShe sounds unpleasant. Both how she expressed her disinterest by being rude and demeaning and how she continued to try to create drama over not being fawned over to get the group focused on making her happy when she chose to be miserable are negative ways to try to be the center of attention.", "NTA - She behaved like an entitled, insulting, spoiled brat.\n\nWhen your friends do something you opt not to do, you SIT WITH THEM like a grown mature adult and talk with them. Why miss out on time together just because 3/4 want to participate in something? She chose not to - that's on her.\n\nMight I suggest that you speak with the others... and from now on perhaps the group 'imbeciles' (wow, she is a piece of work) start going out and doing things you guys enjoy. Just the 3 of you :) Maybe find some others who enjoy similar pastimes and invite them as well.\n\nBut you know who shouldn't be invited again? The toddler that called you names, threw a fit, demanded special attention, threatened to call an Uber.
