In all honesty after we left, my mother never spoke of him, and neither did my sisters. When Mel was old enough to ask, all she ever got from our mother were short/vague answers.

It\u2019s not that I want her to be naive, but I don\u2019t want her to lose that hope.\n\nI realize that I should sit her down and talk to her about it because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to keep lying to her, so I\u2019ve told myself that the next time she asks, I\u2019ll be honest.\nThe issue is that I know if I tell my mother I want to tell Ren the truth, she\u2019ll be upset, just like she was when Jess and I told Mel.\n\nIf I talked to Ren about it anyway, knowing my mother wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with it (because it is her story and not necessarily mine), would that make me an AH?", "created_utc": 1678127622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k9asa/wibta_for_telling_my_daughter_the_reason_why_shes/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
