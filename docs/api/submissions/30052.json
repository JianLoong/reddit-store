I quickly learned that Alex really likes attention. Every week there's something new with her. She comes out as a gender/sexuality (only to recant it later), she suddenly has a new disorder/condition, she's \"badly\" injured (a small burn or cut), or she has a new stalker/enemy, etc. I know her parents and they're assholes. Because of this I ignored her behavior and sometimes I even indulged her just make her feel better. (Looking back now, I regret it).\n\n\nAlex's newest thing is Tourette's syndrome. That happened a few weeks ago and immediately pissed me off because I actually have a friend who suffers from Tourette's. It's not fun or quirky, it can be humiliating and debilitating. When Alex told me she was diagnosed with it, I flat out told her \"no, you weren't. Not this late in life. Tourette's is something that's usually diagnosed in early childhood.\" She swore she had it and I didn't feel like arguing with her in case I was wrong. Ever since she's started randomly twitching and making noises. Again, this happened out of nowhere. I've known her since 2019 and this is the first time she's shown \"symptoms\" of Tourette's. It's getting to the point I can't even sit next to her. She's driving me nuts. I can't focus on my work. She's constantly bumping into me, making noises, and looking for validation; \"oh sorry for bothering you, I know it's annoying.\" I thought after calling her out once and ignoring her she'd quit after a week. But it's almost been a month and I'm at my wits end with her.\n\n\nYesterday I was drawing out a blueprint for a project our group had. Because Alex sat next to me she was in my group. I couldn't hold a conversation with her due to her stuttering and making noises. She also kept bumping me while I was drawing. I tried asking her to calm down. I even asked if we could move seats. She kept insisting that she'd \"try to stop\". **This is where I may be the asshole:** After another 10 minutes of this I yelled at her to stop acting weird and to just be normal till the end of class. I didn't mean to yell, it just came out. But I'm tired of her made-up drama and now she's physically getting in the way of my work. She got upset. And while she magically stopped twitching and making noises, she also started crying and left school early. I texted her, apologizing for shouting but also stating my own feelings about her behavior. She blocked me and didn't come into school today.\n\n\nPeople are split. While most think I'm right to be angry, they think yelling was too far. Some say I can't just assume Alex doesn't have Tourette's and that I'm ableist. Some say I'm completely justified, but Alex also is somewhat unpopular, so there's obvious bias against her. I'm honestly unsure. I don't think I should've raised my voice, but faking a condition for attention is pretty scummy.

Stop apologizing to Alex. Alex is a pick-me addict with main character syndrome.", "NTA - she's 20 years old, this is 12 year old nonsense.  I mean I actually assumed you were in middle school reading this until I went back and checked ages.  You don't just spontaneously develop Tourette's at 20.  Just stop being friends with her, people like this are exhausting and not worth the time.", "The way you reacted in a public class isn\u2019t great but I still say NTA. Pretending you have diseases, disorders, diagnoses or even gender/sexuality differences is so fucked up. People experience life time struggles from this. People kill themselves because of how these things affect their lives. And she\u2019s just using it to feel special and get attention.\n\nIf you guys were younger I\u2019d be less harsh. A lot of kids pull no sense growing up, everything from a diagnosis to claiming your uncle is in the secret service lmao. But she\u2019s way too old and should have grown out of lying for attention to such a degree. This is ridiculous at this point and harmful. It could even be seen as making fun of disabled people, tbh. She\u2019s just acting how she feels someone with Tourette\u2019s should and that\u2019s pretty gross.\n\nMaybe you could just tell her you care about her and want to be a friend, but it is obvious to you and everyone else that she makes these things up and you\u2019d rather be friends with the real her, not the her she keeps pretending to be. If she stays denying about faking shit tho idk what you can do", "NTA. Shes mocking/mimicking disabilities for attention. Honestly if she IS actually clear of mind shes no different than a person that steals handicap placards for parking, or buying vests online so they can pretend that their pet/esa is a real service animal..... all of which should be criminal offenses.... that being said have you heard of \"factitious disorder\"? And does your school have a councilor you can report her behaviors to? Something should be done, even if she pitches a tantrum over it.", "NTA\n\nShe's got some serious issues. She doesn't sound like a hypochondriac. This is some weird sort of medical stolen valor.\n\nShe needs a psychiatrist.", "NTA. This person sounds miserable to be around. Don\u2019t subject yourself to their drama.", "NTA. You probably should not have raised your voice yes but what she is doing is definitely not right. Tell the teachers or something because if it is real then they should make accommodations for her it should not impact your work.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you tried to deescalate without yelling but weren't getting through to her. I hate seeing people faking illness just to get attention, it's ridiculous. Illnesses aren't just some luxury that get you cool things", "I think you've probably been an ah to yourself. You've given a drama queen new material to seek sympathy for.", "NTA. She sounds just horrible.", "NTA\n\nYou asked several times; everyone has their limit.  This girl may have a more serious problem than the fake ones she pretends to have, but that is not really your concern.  I wonder if her parents are abusive or neglectful and the reason, she is acting out is because she gets zero care at home.  She is entirely too old to behave like a child.  Try to not yell in the future, but I understand why you did.", "NTA, but I would like to point out that it is possible to develop Tourette's late in life. Have a look for \"The mum who got Tourette's\" - she developed it at 40.", "NTA. Sadly I don't think you can say or do anything to make her stop. My aunt is exactly like this. Last year alone she came up with 50 illnesses (I've counted them) which she didn't have. She has to have attention on her all the time. \n\nLike she had knee surgery like 1.5 year ago. She walks normal but when she wants attention, she starts limping and trying to strike a conversation with someone and tell them all about her surgery, acting like she had it recently. And when she starts complaining about another medical issue, my mom will tell her to go to a hospital and that shuts her up, because she wants to talk about it and can't see a doctor because the illness isn't real. \n\nHonestly don't say anything about her faking another illness. Just ignore it. Don't entertain her.", "NTA- I mean you shouldn\u2019t of yelled but its insane behavior to fake Tourette\u2019s so oh well if shes mad I would not associate with her anyways", "ESH\n\nYou need to distance yourself from this person.", "NTA You don't need friends like thay.", "So ESH for me. No you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her in front of everyone.m.  She obviously has some attention-needing issues and it\u2019s unfortunate that they are so annoying and affecting class work,\nso I TOTALLY understand your frustration and anger that she won\u2019t focus on the work.\n\nI think you should have a one-on-one conversation with her, tell her that you\u2019re worried about her and ask her to get some mental health counseling with the uni (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re at a university), where it usually is free.   Apologize for yelling and losing your temper, but also be clear that you don\u2019t like to be distracted during class time so you\u2019re asking her to please respect that.\n\nThen distance yourself from her if you need to, (and you need to distance in my opinion) You weren\u2019t close friends as you said.\n\nDownvote away:  you can tell someone you\u2019re not happy with them without yelling.", "ESH. No, you shouldn\u2019t have yelled. No, she should\u2019ve be faking illnesses and disorders that truly do impact peoples lives. \n\nUltimately, if she blocked you, you got what you wanted, right? Presumably she\u2019ll avoid you and you don\u2019t have to be friends with her anymore. It sounds like you don\u2019t have the capacity in your life for this friend, and that regardless of the validity of her diagnoses, you do not have the energy to be a compassionate friend given her circumstances. Sometimes it\u2019s okay to let friendships go.", "Soft YTA for yelling. Go to your guidance counsellor, relay everything like you did here and ask for advice. Hopefully this will get Alex on their radar so maybe she can get the help she needs too. Good Luck OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell her she has Munchausen Syndrome; because that sounds like her, with a hefty dose of Main Character fetish and Narcissism. She needs therapy.", "This person is in desperate need of attention, and they do not care if it's positive or negative attention.  Attention is attention, and you fed into it.    You were out of line for raising your voice, but she wasn't doing anything to \"stop\" her behavior if it was really a problem.  I think she was pulling these ticks and touching you repeatedly on purpose to provoke a response - *which is why she refused to switch seats.*  If she really couldn't help it, and if she really didn't want to disturb you or interrupt the project, she would have moved.  Or told the teacher.  Or done.... anything at all.  I think she deliberately wanted you to yell at her, so she could have all the attention of the class on her...and so she can milk it in future. \n\nBasically, you need to cut this person off.  *Anything you say to her she will interpret into what she wants to hear.*  Give her silence.  Nothing to misinterpret.   \n\nYou shouldn't have yelled, but I can forgive that because you asked her more than once to stop, she didn't, and you've been dealing with this for a month.

You call her a \"friend,\" but based on your initial description it sounds like you haven't actually liked her for a long time. It sounds like you're both in college and so your seat isn't assigned. I think you should have stopped sitting next to her and talking to her long before it got to the point where you needed to yell publicly at her, probably at least at the point where you thought the was faking Tourette's.", "NTA.

People start dumping drama on me?  I walk away.  A friend wants to get into a fight about something stupid?  I say \"that's nice\" and wait a week for them to get over it.  Obviously I apologize when it's serious and I'm in the wrong, but if it's petty nonsense, I just don't.  My friends learned pretty quickly not to get me involved in the drama and my life was way easier."]}
