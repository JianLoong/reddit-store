{"id": 5541, "submission_id": "zudvn0", "title": "AITA for not forgiving my Father", "selftext": "This a bit of a long one, when I was 10 my Father moved to another country to work (US from Canada). At 12 he and my mother divorced after he had an affair with a woman where he was living. \n\nAfter high school my Dad invited me to come live with him for  my university.  I agreed as it would obviously save me a bunch of money on living expenses and I was excited to reconnect with him and spend a few years together.  \n\nWhat he didn\u2019t tell me until all the plans had been made and I paid for my first semester, was he had moved his GF in with him so I\u2019d be living with both of them. I wasn\u2019t thrilled but it was too late now.\n\nHis GF made it clear from the get go I wasn\u2019t welcome. She felt threatened by my presence as she was quite invested in having my Father integrate completely into her large family.  She excluded me from any of her family gatherings while also making sure in the 4 years I was there I didn\u2019t get literally an afternoon alone with my Father. She would even insist on coming with us to the freaking hardware store. \n\nAs graduation approached she made it very clear I wasn\u2019t welcome to stay to the point she informed me the day after I graduated if I wasn\u2019t on my way back to Canada she would call immigration on me. I let my Father know and he just wouldn\u2019t believe me.\n\nSo I moved back and basically stopped interacting with my Father beyond yearly calls for Birthdays and Christmas.\n\n15 years later I met my future wife, got engaged and started planning the wedding. My sisters had been on me for years to work things out with my Father, so I had been making an effort for the previous 6 months prior to my engagement. I thought this event would be a chance to further mend some fences.\n\n So I invite my father and his wife (the GF I had to live with) to the wedding. At first they agreed, but about 6 weeks before the wedding he called to say they couldn\u2019t make it, something to do with them just selling their house. I was upset but whatever, I was surprised when they agreed in the first place. \n\nSo wedding week comes around and I see on his wife\u2019s Facebook page a post about how much fun they were having at her yearly Family Reunion.  The kicker, the family reunion that year was at her daughters house less than a 2 hr drive from where I live and where the wedding was. This would be about a 14hr drive from my Fathers house. \n\nSo I was pretty mad to say the least. Haven\u2019t spoken or communicated with him since then (10 years now). He is getting old old (85) now and my sisters tell me I\u2019m a jerk for not speaking with him for all these years. Of course they never had to live with his wife or have any idea how I was treated while living there They say they would have forgiven him for missing their wedding, which I know is easy to say when it didn\u2019t happen too them.\n\nAITA for not forgiving him for missing my wedding?", "created_utc": 1671901365, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zudvn0/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_father/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your sisters you will visit at his funeral.", "NTA because it\u2019s not just the wedding - it\u2019s a bunch of other stuff too. Your dad repeatedly put himself and other people before you, well into your adulthood. Why should you forgive him? He\u2019s probably not even sorry.", "NTA. And I think you have more reasons not to forgive than just missing the wedding. Plus, it doesn't sound like your father was asking for forgiveness or wanna try & reconcile with you.

He has made it clear he cares more about his New wife than you, at the end of the day it is on him.", "Nope NTA. He let you down as a supporting loving parent so I understand your pain. Just don't carry it around with you anymore. You deserve to live peacefully and free of shitty anger! Good luck!", "NTA. Forgiving may help you let go of the resentment but you also don\u2019t have to interact with him even if he\u2019s old old. Has your father been apologetic at all?

It isn't your job to mend the relationship.  Your dad made his choices, the consequence is no relationship with you.  Him getting old/dying isn't a reason to forgive and forget.  I have never understood this.  So everything you did is fine because you are old?  Totally fine you abandoned your kid because you are old?  He prioritized his wife's kids, that is who he now has.\n\nTell your sister she needs to butt out and you will no longer discuss your dad with her.  He made his choices and had every opportunity to mend fences.  He chose not to.", "NTA. He is a terrible father. Doesn't deserve forgiveness. I don't see him reaching out to you or asking for forgiveness. Fuck him. Your sisters should butt out", "NTA.

Since he is not reaching out either, it seems he is ok with nc. (btw Block their FB accounts, do not set yourself up for more hurt. ) If you reconnect with him, you should only do it because YOU want to, not for anyone else. Your sisters have no stake in this, it is none of their business and it does not affect their lives. They should respect your decision, even if they don't understand it.", "NTA. Also, forgiveness is for you, not for him. You forgive someone to clear your heart of their bullshit and not to say what they did was ok. In this case, forgiveness could also prove that you're a better person than he is which sounds like you are.", " NTA - you deserve people in your life who make time for you, and you shouldn\u2019t bend yourself over for him or anyone. If he wants to see you, he should make the effort.", "NTA. He hasn't reached to you first, and you don't have to reach out to him first either. So what if he's getting old? He's done a bad job as a father to you, IMO. You need to set boundaries regarding your sisters guilt tripping you... As you've said, they haven't been in your shoes interacting with his AH wife. Also the cheating they both did, they didn't even apologize for that for years.", "No but for your own peace of mind try forgiving the person. You don\u2019t have to forgive what he\u2019s done.", "Their take is he\u2019s getting old and I\u2019m an asshole for not giving him the \u201cpeace\u201d of reconciliation.", "I truly rarely even think about him anymore and haven\u2019t for years. This year his health has deteriorated and my sisters have been relentless, especially around the last couple weeks, Christmas an all that. They watch too many Hallmark Holiday movies.", "He knows as my sister told him why I haven\u2019t  spoken with him, but he also has never called or apologized in 10 years. He complains to my sisters that I never call him, but that\u2019s it.", "No. My father was 48 and she was 56 when they met. She had 8 kids from a previous marriage who were all in the late 20s/30s when I moved there for Uni.

Age doesn\u2019t reward you automatic reconciliation from all the wrongs you have caused in your life. If he wanted your forgiveness then he should have made the effort. \n\nI am sorry that your father failed you so. You are NTA by any stretch.", "If he wanted the peace of reconciliation he wouldn\u2019t have been such a shit stain of person as a whole, not to mention as a father.  Your sisters need to have a big glass of shut the hell up and sit the hell down.", "Has he reached out or is it all on you?", "If age comes with wisdom, he should know you give you that gift first for his conscience if it matters to him.

Have you had a serious loving conversation with your sisters about the fact that you don't \"hate\" your dad but will never have contact because he supported and chose your abuser over you repeatedly?  They may mean well but the continual barrage regarding him is somewhat re-victimizing you. His wife was abusive to you and he allowed it. That is NEVER ok.", "NTA    he can complain all he wants, he allowed his gf to treat you as less than human, and he has never contacted you, how is any of that your fault? Even if he did call you, I wouldn't answer the phone.\n\nIt sounds like the only reason he complains to your sister, is to get sympathy, and I don't believe for a second that he didn't know why you weren't in touch with him. \n\nMy only suggestion is to give up your anger, I don't mean you have to forgive him, or contact him, that boat has sailed, but maintaining hard feelings only takes away from the joy of life. He isn't worth it. \n\nIf your sister brings it up again, simply tell her you have no interest in the conversation, and if she brings it up again after that, walk away, or hang up the phone. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful holiday.", "OP tell your siblings he has other kids who can attend to him. And i would call out your siblings who didn't attend to your suffering. OP cut contact for your own sake.", "Is his wife still alive?\nPersonally, I would not want to have a relationship with him.", "You don\u2019t do it for him. You do it for yourself.", "Right? The phones, like the highways, go both ways. NTA", "He hasn\u2019t picked up the phone to call me in 30 years.", "Yes she is. Their lives revolve around her family and the grand and great grand kids.", "Nah. You work through the issues it caused for yourself. Let go of the anger, but don\u2019t have to forgive someone who hasn\u2019t done the work for it. That is my huge issue with this Christiany culture. \u201cForgiveness\u201d without atonement is seriously just a blank check for more abuse. OP doesn\u2019t owe anyone, especially someone who has ignored him for years forgiveness or reconciliation. Dad is the one who wants it and dad won\u2019t even ask. He could send a letter, something. But no. The family wants Op to capitulate and roll over and pretend the issues aren\u2019t there. Dad chose a family reunion for his wife over his kid\u2019s wedding, refused to believe when GF said they would call immigration on OP and then pretended OP doesn\u2019t exist for years at a time. OP has done all the work. He shouldn\u2019t have to do more. Letting go of anger is not the same as forgiveness. I let go of the anger I felt for years for my deadbeat father. Doesn\u2019t mean I forgave him.", "I would make that my shield every time sisters bring it up \"if he gave a shit he knows how the phone works\"", "Fuck him.  He owes you the world and You owe him nothing", "He\u2019s not asking for forgiveness or a relationship with you.  He may not even want either of those things for all you know.  Your sisters need to back off.", "I totally understand what you are saying.  I\u2019m so tired of the you must forgive for yourself tripe."]}
