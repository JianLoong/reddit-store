{"id": 5541, "submission_id": "zudvn0", "title": "AITA for not forgiving my Father", "selftext": "This a bit of a long one, when I was 10 my Father moved to another country to work (US from Canada). At 12 he and my mother divorced after he had an affair with a woman where he was living. \n\nAfter high school my Dad invited me to come live with him for  my university.  I agreed as it would obviously save me a bunch of money on living expenses and I was excited to reconnect with him and spend a few years together.  \n\nWhat he didn\u2019t tell me until all the plans had been made and I paid for my first semester, was he had moved his GF in with him so I\u2019d be living with both of them. I wasn\u2019t thrilled but it was too late now.\n\nHis GF made it clear from the get go I wasn\u2019t welcome. She felt threatened by my presence as she was quite invested in having my Father integrate completely into her large family.  She excluded me from any of her family gatherings while also making sure in the 4 years I was there I didn\u2019t get literally an afternoon alone with my Father. She would even insist on coming with us to the freaking hardware store. \n\nAs graduation approached she made it very clear I wasn\u2019t welcome to stay to the point she informed me the day after I graduated if I wasn\u2019t on my way back to Canada she would call immigration on me. I let my Father know and he just wouldn\u2019t believe me.\n\nSo I moved back and basically stopped interacting with my Father beyond yearly calls for Birthdays and Christmas.\n\n15 years later I met my future wife, got engaged and started planning the wedding. My sisters had been on me for years to work things out with my Father, so I had been making an effort for the previous 6 months prior to my engagement. I thought this event would be a chance to further mend some fences.\n\n So I invite my father and his wife (the GF I had to live with) to the wedding. At first they agreed, but about 6 weeks before the wedding he called to say they couldn\u2019t make it, something to do with them just selling their house. I was upset but whatever, I was surprised when they agreed in the first place. \n\nSo wedding week comes around and I see on his wife\u2019s Facebook page a post about how much fun they were having at her yearly Family Reunion.  The kicker, the family reunion that year was at her daughters house less than a 2 hr drive from where I live and where the wedding was. This would be about a 14hr drive from my Fathers house. \n\nSo I was pretty mad to say the least. Haven\u2019t spoken or communicated with him since then (10 years now). He is getting old old (85) now and my sisters tell me I\u2019m a jerk for not speaking with him for all these years. Of course they never had to live with his wife or have any idea how I was treated while living there They say they would have forgiven him for missing their wedding, which I know is easy to say when it didn\u2019t happen too them.\n\nAITA for not forgiving him for missing my wedding?", "created_utc": 1671901365, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zudvn0/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_father/", "score": 206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Forgiving may help you let go of the resentment but you also don\u2019t have to interact with him even if he\u2019s old old. Has your father been apologetic at all?

If he wants to see you, he should make the effort.", "NTA. He hasn't reached to you first, and you don't have to reach out to him first either. So what if he's getting old? He's done a bad job as a father to you, IMO. You need to set boundaries regarding your sisters guilt tripping you... As you've said, they haven't been in your shoes interacting with his AH wife.

Even if he did call you, I wouldn't answer the phone.\n\nIt sounds like the only reason he complains to your sister, is to get sympathy, and I don't believe for a second that he didn't know why you weren't in touch with him. \n\nMy only suggestion is to give up your anger, I don't mean you have to forgive him, or contact him, that boat has sailed, but maintaining hard feelings only takes away from the joy of life. He isn't worth it. \n\nIf your sister brings it up again, simply tell her you have no interest in the conversation, and if she brings it up again after that, walk away, or hang up the phone. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful holiday.", "OP tell your siblings he has other kids who can attend to him.

Let go of the anger, but don\u2019t have to forgive someone who hasn\u2019t done the work for it.

OP doesn\u2019t owe anyone, especially someone who has ignored him for years forgiveness or reconciliation. Dad is the one who wants it and dad won\u2019t even ask. He could send a letter, something. But no. The family wants Op to capitulate and roll over and pretend the issues aren\u2019t there. Dad chose a family reunion for his wife over his kid\u2019s wedding, refused to believe when GF said they would call immigration on OP and then pretended OP doesn\u2019t exist for years at a time. OP has done all the work. He shouldn\u2019t have to do more. Letting go of anger is not the same as forgiveness. I let go of the anger I felt for years for my deadbeat father.

If your father reaches out, read his letters or listen to him on your own terms now.\n\nForgive him for his failings in your own way, but consider that he more than likely will not take accountability at his current age any more than he would as a younger man walking out on his family all those years ago.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you are hurting.
