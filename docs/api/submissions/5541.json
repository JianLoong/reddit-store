{"id": 5541, "submission_id": "zudvn0", "title": "AITA for not forgiving my Father", "selftext": "This a bit of a long one, when I was 10 my Father moved to another country to work (US from Canada). At 12 he and my mother divorced after he had an affair with a woman where he was living. \n\nAfter high school my Dad invited me to come live with him for  my university.  I agreed as it would obviously save me a bunch of money on living expenses and I was excited to reconnect with him and spend a few years together.  \n\nWhat he didn\u2019t tell me until all the plans had been made and I paid for my first semester, was he had moved his GF in with him so I\u2019d be living with both of them. I wasn\u2019t thrilled but it was too late now.\n\nHis GF made it clear from the get go I wasn\u2019t welcome. She felt threatened by my presence as she was quite invested in having my Father integrate completely into her large family.  She excluded me from any of her family gatherings while also making sure in the 4 years I was there I didn\u2019t get literally an afternoon alone with my Father. She would even insist on coming with us to the freaking hardware store. \n\nAs graduation approached she made it very clear I wasn\u2019t welcome to stay to the point she informed me the day after I graduated if I wasn\u2019t on my way back to Canada she would call immigration on me. I let my Father know and he just wouldn\u2019t believe me.\n\nSo I moved back and basically stopped interacting with my Father beyond yearly calls for Birthdays and Christmas.\n\n15 years later I met my future wife, got engaged and started planning the wedding. My sisters had been on me for years to work things out with my Father, so I had been making an effort for the previous 6 months prior to my engagement. I thought this event would be a chance to further mend some fences.\n\n So I invite my father and his wife (the GF I had to live with) to the wedding. At first they agreed, but about 6 weeks before the wedding he called to say they couldn\u2019t make it, something to do with them just selling their house. I was upset but whatever, I was surprised when they agreed in the first place. \n\nSo wedding week comes around and I see on his wife\u2019s Facebook page a post about how much fun they were having at her yearly Family Reunion.  The kicker, the family reunion that year was at her daughters house less than a 2 hr drive from where I live and where the wedding was. This would be about a 14hr drive from my Fathers house. \n\nSo I was pretty mad to say the least. Haven\u2019t spoken or communicated with him since then (10 years now). He is getting old old (85) now and my sisters tell me I\u2019m a jerk for not speaking with him for all these years. Of course they never had to live with his wife or have any idea how I was treated while living there They say they would have forgiven him for missing their wedding, which I know is easy to say when it didn\u2019t happen too them.\n\nAITA for not forgiving him for missing my wedding?", "created_utc": 1671901365, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zudvn0/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_father/", "score": 950, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And even if he did, you\u2019re still under NO obligation to do so. You protected yourself and your mental health when your dad clearly didn\u2019t give a crap. Good for you!!", "NTA. You have no obligation to give him your time and energy. If he truly cared, he would have made time for you.", "NTA.\n\nRemember that old saying, \"To err is human; to forgive, divine.\" You're HUMAN, not divine. And forgiveness is overrated. You have no reason to forgive this selfish man who let his GF dictate his entire life.", "That is if the wife even allows him there.", "I didn\u2019t think I was, but with his health declining with age  my sisters have me doubting myself on the issue lately. Like a good son would forgive and make him feel better about things in the end.", "Their insistence is confusing to me seeing as our Father missed everyone of their kids graduations but one time drove 8hrs for one of his wife\u2019s grand kid\u2019s kindergarten graduation\u2026", "Is he even uneasy about it? Seems like if he wanted to make amends he could pick up the phone and take the first step.", "OP should say he'll reconcile at his grave then. He doesn't need anyone's permission to show up to the grave after the funeral", "The wedding only became the straw for me when he lied about not being able to attend due to selling their house and it was too far, then ended up driving almost the entire way here for a yearly family reunion for his wife\u2019s family.", "Your father complaining to your sisters that you don't call him when he's not picking up the phone to call you, either, is blatant hypocrisy. \"It's not my fault we don't talk. Tell your brother he should call me.\"\n\nHe's the one who ought to be calling to apologize.", "Like you said, easy for them to say when they didn\u2019t go through it, their opinion is invalid", "You don\u2019t have to make him feel better for the mistakes he made and never even tried to make up for", "I absolutely love that last line.", "I was coming to find this comment.", "Yup. OP owes him nothing - not forgiveness or reconciliation.", "He has clearly made his choice. He needs to stop complaining when he talks to your sisters.", "So, they basically had a different dad/family and can't relate to your experience. Not your problem.", "He calls my sisters and complains I never call him. Then they get on me for not calling him.", "That is what's commonly known as \"sending the flying monkeys.\" If he can call them to complain so they will go after you, he can call you himself.", "Yeah, fuck that noise. You're good, OP. NTA.\n\nI'm sorry your sisters are putting that pressure on you. Hope you have a happy holiday.", "He is playing a sad game. Next time they call, tell them you always calls and his wife says he doesn't want to talk to you.  If he wants to talk, he needs to use the same phone number that they did.", "> They say they would have forgiven him for missing their wedding\n\nLol, hahaha, LMFAO. Yeah, no way they would, especially with what he did instead.\n\nNTA OP", "He hasn't asked for your forgiveness, and even if he did, you have no obligation to give it, no matter what anyone says.\n\nYou owe him nothing. He made his bed by taking his wife's word over yours and choosing to miss what was probably one of the most important days of your life. Now, he can live with the consequences. \n\nAs for your sisters, they need to respect your decision and butt the fuck out.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nTell your sisters they have not lived your life; they are not you. Have they lived with dad and his GF for four years? Have they had dad blow of their wedding to be at his wife's family reunion? When they have, they can talk. Till then they can shut up or be shut out. Then, instead of one relationship that's irreparably broken, there can be even more - based on their failure to respect your boundaries.\n\nI'm sorry about dad... but congratulations on your wedding!", "NTA - he made his choice (his now-wife) repeatedly. If he wanted to get in contact, he could have made contact, rather than just complaining that you hadn\u2019t made the effort. The question is, will you be content with how things worked out if he passes away without you having seen him, even to tell him how disappointed you are?", "NTA he could have reached out at any point. His phone works both ways.", "You'd never be TA for not forgiving. Forgiveness comes when and if you're ready for it, not when others are. \nWith that said, your father is a complete tool. Like his wife is an AH obviously but your father clearly doesn't want to reconcile, not really. \nYou're better off. Hope your wedding was fun, congrats on that, and hope you have a nice Christmas with your family (that obviously doesn't include him)", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s even the one asking to reconnect. Why do you sisters care so much?", "NTA.  It sounds like your actions are appropriate.", "NTA\n\nWhy are people always so adamant that the victim needs to forgive those who wronged them, and never that the wrong doer needs to apologise to the victim. So backwards. Stop trying with him, he obviously doesn't love you or care.", "This all is very sad to read. It sounds like your dad caused you a lot of pain.\n\nI would be unable to not forgive him. I would be careful not to give him an opportunity to hurt me again, but I would reach out and forgive him.  \n\nHis complaining to your sisters that you never call might be his way of reaching out. Pride is a terrible thing. He could be too proud or too embarrassed about how he behaved to reach out to you directly or in a more forward fashion.\n\n\nBut the question you asked is about you and not him. Just make sure that if you choose to not reach out to him that it won't hurt you more in the long run. There will be a time where you will not get a choice anymore to forgive him.\n\nBut NTA\n\n.", "#NTA. Let the old man and his wife go. Let the sisters go if you need to.", "NTA. Your father allowed his AH of a new wife to alienate you from your father's half of your original family.", "Age has NOTHING to do with death.     \nMy dads family always said his parents were getting old (90s) and he and his brothers should talk to their parents.    \nBoth my sisters died at 40.     \nAnyone can die at any age.     \nSaying you have to forgive him because he\u2019s old and could die soon makes no sense.    \nYou were the one hurt by him which means only you can decide if you forgive him or not.    \nTell your sisters everything so they don\u2019t think it\u2019s just about the wedding (tho even if it was that would be enough).    \nHas he even called or came to see you to apologise ?     \nHas he even admitted what he did wrong ?", "Your father clearly isn't interested in spending time with you. You invited him. You don't owe him more. Your sisters need to chill. You can't make your father show up.", "Why do you owe him that?  He has had every opportunity to make it right, and never has, in all these years.  Has he ever apologized for any of it?  No?  Then, uh, screw 'im.", "I would remind your sisters he has continuously chosen the gf over you. If he cared about your relationship he would have shown up. Sissys need to face the fact that their dad doesn\u2019t care to have peace of reconciliation. His relationship with you never mattered. NTA", "What about your peace for what his GF did and the lie he told and attended his other family's reunion? You deserve peace as well NTA", "This is the take for me too. OP\u2019s father made a choice and never attempted to fix his own shortcomings. That\u2019s not on OP. I say this as someone whose father made a similar poor choice and I never forgave him. He died. My mom always says some day I\u2019ll regret not speaking to him the last 5ish years of his life and blah blah blah. It\u2019s been over two years since he died and I still feel zero guilt.", "No, he hasn\u2019t called me for 30 years. I was the one that called for his bday and Christmas every year and before my wedding when I was trying to mend our relationship at my sister\u2019s requests.  He still has never apologized for missing my wedding.", "Solidarity against asshole fathers and blind siblings my friend! My sister is very close to the father I am estranged from and thinks I have some beef with her being close to him. I don\u2019t, and if anything this idea that I\u2019m \u201canti-our father\u201d is pure myth making on her part, because being \u201canti\u201d anything would still mean caring about what he\u2019s doing or not doing or giving a shit about anything to do with him. The reality is a lot less dramatic than my sister likes to believe; I am indifferent to our father since our estrangment. We haven\u2019t spoken in over 5 years now and it\u2019s still the best decision I\u2019ve made in my life. It was like a weird switch in my brain went off at that time that if my father couldn\u2019t be respectful of me or try to understand his child in any way without being purposeful bigoted and hurtful, i was not losing out on anything by cutting him out of my life- I refuse to invest any energy in thinking about or engaging with someone who contributes nothing to my life and whose opinions are never going to change. For my sister, it\u2019s a more palatable to think I \u201chate\u201d my father for transgressions during the divorce rather than his fundamental character before and after being married to our mother. She wants to believe I cut him off to hurt him. But the truth is very inconvenient for her - I really truly do NOT care what he\u2019s doing with his life post-estrangement and it drives my sister MAD that I\u2019m so indifferent and removed from any high emotion (either loving him like she does or hating him like she believes I do). She also thinks I\u2019m threatened by her still having a relationship with him when I\u2019m in fact very happy for her - I\u2019m happy to see that she is getting the quality time with him as an adult that she wanted so badly when we were younger and she was too young to understand why our mother left him. She is getting what she needs from him and so am I! Our needs from him are just very different: she needs his presence and I need his absence. I would normally call this sort of thing the OP is going through as triangulation but that involves at least 3 people: 2 directs and one proxy. This is just between OPs decision and his sisters feelings. The father is just a red herring covering for family dynamics and a lot of trauma. As others have pointed out, if the father wanted even the performance of reconciliation, the father would be making half assed attempts himself and not leaving it to the sister. Half assed attempts and reach outs and cold call emails are pretty easy to do even for deadbeat dads. \ud83d\ude43"]}
