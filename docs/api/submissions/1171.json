All of my cousins, aunts and uncles, and even grandparents came over to my family\u2019s house to for a fun day where we enjoy some quality family time.\n\nAfter everyone got to the house, we began one of my favorite family traditions which is a family two-hand touch football game, which we always play before sitting down to watch football for the rest of the day. The teams were split up evenly with 7 people on each side. After the game got started, I (20M) noticed my cousin (18M) was playing much harder than he used too. He was slapping hands away to avoid being touched and running through people to get as many yards as possible.\n\nA few minutes into the game, he got a screen pass and started running, with me standing in between him and the end zone. As we ran at each other, I squared up and prepared to basically catch him so I could stop his momentum (keep in mind this was not supposed to be tackle football. He, on the other hand, lowered his head and basically ran over me, with the top of his head catching me right in the eye and cheek.\n\nI fell over holding my eye and it when I took my hand away, I already could barely see out of it because of the swelling. I ended up having to go to the hospital to get x-rays and a CT scan which showed multiple fractures around my eye socket and on my cheekbone, in addition to having a major black eye. Even though its been 5 days, my eye is still swollen shut and very black, but luckily there shouldn't be any long term damage.\n\nNeedless to say, I spent basically the entire afternoon in the ER and didn\u2019t get back until pretty late. By then, I couldn\u2019t see out of my eye at all and it was really badly bruised. I was feeling really self conscious about it, not to mention worried about the actual health of my eye. When we got home, everyone had already eaten. I don\u2019t blame them, but it sucks that I missed dinner.\n\nWhen I walked through the door, most of the family was shocked when they saw how bad I looked and didn\u2019t really say much. When my cousin saw me, however, he laughed and said, \u201cnext time, stay out of the way, but don\u2019t worry, we saved you a plate.\u201d\n\nI lost it. I started yelling at him that this is all his fault and that he broke my face because of what he did. I finished by calling him an AH and tossing the plate up at him, getting food all over him. He looked really hurt and walked away and I stormed up to my room and didn\u2019t come out for the rest of the night.\n\nOver the past few days, I\u2019ve been getting messages from family members telling me that what I did was really inappropriate, that I hurt his feelings and ruined family dinner. I\u2019ve been told by multiple people that I should apologize. Part of me wants to because I may have taken it too far, but the other part of me thinks that he doesn\u2019t deserve one since he never apologized.

You had  just been badly injured and the cousins bad joke was too much.  You reacted in a human way. He should have apologized.  My advice is indeed stay out of his way.", "I haven't seen him since that happened.  Apparently, he actually does feel pretty bad about it, but I haven't gotten an apology yet.  Maybe he plans on doing it in person?  I imagine I'll see him (well kind of) on Sunday.\n\nAssuming he does apologize, should I respond with my own apology for reacting how I did?"]}
