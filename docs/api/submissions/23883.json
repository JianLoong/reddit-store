I\u2019m not sure about laws and parent rights and everything, but I feel like that is something to consider: that you didn\u2019t want to be a parent. Granted, you had unprotected sex so you are obviously responsible for getting Jake\u2019s mother pregnant, but it\u2019s not really fair to you that you were forced to take care of a child you didn\u2019t want. \n\nAt the same time, though, Jake and Mike are innocent in all this. Neither of them asked to be born. \n\nI think your attitude is understandable, though cold and distant. Not everyone wants to be a parent or grandparent. Both are a lot of work. \n\nI\u2019m wondering since Mike is 5 if he can tell that you don\u2019t want to be in his life, but I bet he can.

You have stated you are actually ok with being TA. So why the question? Own it. Do what you want to do. \n\nIt IS very self centered, it does hurt your son and grandson.

As is Mike's mother.\n\nIf I need to give up the next 20 years, and be Daddy again--no. I'll only do it once. This time I'm proverbially getting on the plane to Thailand.  The price is too high. I've done my duty and hung up my parent hat. At this point, yes I am done. I've signed up for and took responsibility for Jake. Jake chose to have Mike, well and good. But now he's the parent. Not me.\n\nAlthough every disagreement on the internet always has going no contact as literally the first port of call, real life isn't like that.  But, because it seems that is what everyone wants to talk about, if let's say that were really what it came down to, so be it. I'd wish him and his family well.  But whether it makes me the asshole or not, I've taken my life back and I'm not going to put it to the side again.\n\nIf the choices are I walk off into the sunset or I have to be daddy again, I am walking off into the sunset. Nobody has threatened such a thing, nor is anyone talking about it.  But this being the internet, it is the go-to that everyone says immediately.  I hope things don't go that way. I don't want them to go that way, but if those are the terms, that will be my choice.", "Indeed you read it right.  I have also considered exactly what you suggest in your last line. Thought very, very hard about it in fact.  \n\nI am far more likely to regret never getting to live my own life, if I were to give that up again.", "No, it doesn't mean I'll tell people that I don't have a son or grandson.  I tell people that freely all the time.  \n\nRather it means that I don't have parental responsibilities anymore. If Mike has a baseball tournament, recital or they need a babysitter, that isn't my department anymore. I see them semi-regularly for visits. If there is some emergency or something, I'll help out.  But I'm doing my own thing and putting my own life first.  Jake is a fully independent adult and he's the father now.  The baseball, recitals, pre-school graduation is all his department now. \n\nDoes that answer your question?", "Your response is actually probably the best fitting and most insightful.  It has never been lost on me that Jake and Mike are innocent. Which is why I did everything I could to conceal how I feel about parenting to Jake although I'm not wearing as much of the mask anymore now that he's an adult.  Jake isn't stupid and I have no question that he's put two and two together and knows that I didn't want to be a father. I'd never say it to him and he hasn't pressed me on it. We just kind of let it lie and I don't think anyone is going to get anything out of poking at that. \n\nThe only time I fully put the mask back on is with Mike. It is a lot easier since it is just maybe a dinner here and there and also younger kids aren't able to see through things like that as easily.  \n\nI have toyed with the idea of moving away. But I've built up a life here. Friends, a GF, clubs, activities. If I didn't have roots, I probably would have. But I just am so done making life decisions around parenting obligations.", ">but you can\u2019t just tell him you\u2019ve checked out of parenting\n\nOh but I did. He doesn't like it. Moreover, yes I actually have stopped parenting. He has a wife, a house and a child. I'm done parenting.\n\nWe have a relationship and see each other semi-regularly.  But it isn't really in the vein of parenting. If let's say some kind of emergency comes up, I'll help him and his family out.  But I am not parenting someone that has their own wife and their own home, nor am I parenting their child.\n\nPerhaps you may find me to be an asshole. But I assure you, I am done parenting and \\*can\\* (and have) said I am checked out of parenting.", "Hahahahaha. What a bs take.\n\nMyself and millions of others would have LOVED to have had a father play such an active role in their lives.", "> Parenthood isn't a job that you retire from.\n\nWatch and see.", "Clearly this guy has made up his mind so I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s even asking for judgment.", "I was and I took responsibility for him. I didn't get on a plane to Thailand and change my name. I raised him to adulthood.", "Indeed, he is and indeed I am. I gave him 20 years of his life, his needs and to a large degree his wants coming first.  That's enough.", ">and still it seems you've been an excellent one\n\nBased on what? He let his son move in when he was 13 after having him every other weekend before that? \"not shirking responsibility\" those things are the bare minimum. Getting him a job? Most parents would if they could. He very well might have been an excellent father. For 8/21 years. But it's a big jump to assume.\n\n And no, no parent who has the kid every other weekend is excellent. Not unless they have been screwed over and are desperately fighting for more custody and trying to rectify the situation. Not a single one of them. It's not possible. He was not excellent before the son moved in that is 100% for sure. So that's more time we *know* he *wasn't* an excellent father than time he might have been one.", "I don't need therapy. I am very clear about who I am, what I've done, what I wish went differently, what I want to be doing and what makes me happy. Throwing thousands of dollars down the drain IS NOT what I want to do with my life.  I don't need that bullshit.\n\nI appreciate your kind words though.", "Oh absolutely.  I don't go THAT far in being hands off.  \n\nI still treat him kindly, get him presents for no reason, do magic tricks for him and so on.  But I think part of it is that Mike's mother's family is super hands on, always there, doing babysitting and is really, really hands on.  I'm not around that much, but when I make sure to do right by Mike.", "Why would I expect that of him?  He is an electrician. Not a doctor. If I'm no longer able to live independently, I expect to go to an assisted living home.\n\nI feel like that's a line people roll out without really thinking through. The reality is that kids don't and can't fairly be expected to \"take care of\" their parents when they are sick. Even if they are willing, they just aren't equipped for it.", "Thanks. I never felt like a good father because I enjoyed so little of it.  I was always a little jealous of the guys where it was like their purpose in life and then their grandchildren were.  I was able to at least act the part with Jake, but I just don't have anything left in the tank to do it again.", "Apparently that isn\u2019t good enough to all people here", "My parents weren't super active in his life, but his mother's parents were fairly active.", "What exactly do you think societal expectations of parents are? Because \u201cfeed, clothe, and home your child\u201d are minimum\nlegal obligations and and preparing your child for adulthood is just barely a step above that.", "If it matters, I still help him out professionally.  A year ago, I got him a spot with an old buddy of mine where because of the nature of the job, there was a 25% premium to the job and they start paying overtime at 33 hours.  It was a 6 month job and he was able to actually get a down payment for a house from all he made. \n\nIt isn't like at his 18th birthday I gave him a carton of cigarettes, a stick to kill game with and a kick out the door.  Hell, he lived with me until he was 20 and only left because he moved in with his now-wife.  I still help him out with things here and there and we have an active relationship. \n\nI'm just not \"Daddy\" anymore, don't have to go to school plays, little league games, babysit, or do childminding related things anymore.", "It\u2019s interesting to call this a modern thing like people weren\u2019t living in multi-generational homes or within short distance of their grandparents and extended family for a huge portion of human history.", "Jake and his wife think so.  I think part of it is that his wife's family was very much that way. Which I do not begrudge and think his wife and her family are lovely people. But I think that is largely where it is coming from.", "> Ok. I've spent 20 years putting Jake first and not really having much of a life.\n\nWhat's that bullshit?! You had him *other weekends* and barely a month in the summer... For the first 13 years you were barely present, why would you blame someone that's not there for stealing your time ... by being absent from your life?", "I very explicitly said \u201cyou might not be the asshole\u201d. So the \u201cif that makes me the asshole, so be it\u201d fake self-flagellation is unnecessary. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, you might think it\u2019s just internet hysteria to suggest going no contact. But I\u2019m not suggesting that your son do that. I just think it\u2019s a possible logical consequence of you saying what you\u2019re saying. He\u2019s telling you the relationship he wants and you\u2019re saying \u201cno\u201d. In any other situation besides parent-child, we would tell someone \u201cif they\u2019re not giving you the relationship you want, you don\u2019t need to have a relationship with them at all\u201d. \n\nAnd even if you\u2019ve never explicitly told him your deep feelings, he knows. He\u2019s not stupid and he\u2019s 100% putting it together now as an adult that you were essentially chomping at the bit to finish your legal obligations to him and step away. It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re comfortable with having a minimal relationship or eventually no relationship with him and his family on your end, but it makes me incredibly sad for him and his kid more than anything else. So I guess congrats on having the life you want now and I\u2019m glad you get to enjoy it.", "But you won't have to \"parent\" his kid though. I'm confused as to why you are thinking of it this way. The main perk of being a grandparent is that you don't have to parent them. You get to do the fun stuff. Have them over, go to see a game, do activities, and then drop them off to their parents, lol. You don't have to make up rules, enforce punishments, make all the hard decisions or anything. I think you're projecting.", "Bruh, even if you didn\u2019t enjoy parenting, do you just not feel any love or compassion for your son!?

I guarantee the reason why your son doesn\u2019t talk to you about it is because he knows you don\u2019t really care. \n\nYou make it seem like being an active parent/grandparent is going to mean sacrificing your happiness and there\u2019s no middle ground.

I think the opposite. I think you've been a GREAT dad because you sacrificed everything, including your own nature, to be a good dad for a child. Also, I think that you're now respecting your nature instead of putting a mask and being falsely grandfather-ish, and I think this is gold, and that the help of a counsellor (a therapist, a nun, a rabbi, whoever you want) would be useful to turn it into a very good lesson for your son, especially if his in laws are so committed to grandparenting, because there's also a lot of social pressure about parenting (and you know it more than me) and being family-ish, so teaching someone that you can be decent (way more than decent) without necessarily being family-ish, that really is a gold lesson and it would be a waste to not convey it", "Look, I get where your coming from, I really do.

A woman ***usually*** can't or wont force a man to cum inside her and get her pregnant. \n\nIf a woman doesn't want pregnancy what do we do?? We take care of our eggs and ensure there's no way to fertilize them. So ***YES if a man doesnt want a child he needs to adequately ensure his sperm isnt gonna fertilize an egg***\n\nBut yeah go off about it being a dumb take LMAO. Go off about it being so dumb for men to take accountability for what is the catalyst for pregnancy.", "Oh jeez. If he was so awful then why would the son desperately want OP\u2019s presence in his kid\u2019s life?", "If he was so awful then why would the son desperately want OP\u2019s presence in his kid\u2019s life?", "I mean\u2026 you knocked her up so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. How smart are you really?", "God, you\u2019re insufferable.", ">I didn't fake loving him.\n\nJudging by some of your responses... yes; you *absolutely* faked it. You don't actually love him, and you do not actually care about him. It's like when someone who is depressed can \"put on a mask\", and seem like the happiest person in the world.\n\nIt's how most sociopaths get by. They can emulate the act, but feel nothing while doing so. You should probably go talk to a professional, as you seem *extremely* emotionally stunted. And frankly; you'll ruin your life with your current mentality.", "Go ahead and removed every maybe from that last paragraph and you're spot on. But hey, do you. YTA from an actual caring father.", "Maybe not the little kid stage, but was there anything you genuinely enjoyed doing with your son? It's ok to be honest and say that even though you love your son, not everything about being a parent delighted you. My parents were honest with me about it. If the vast majority of parents are honest, yeah, they might be proud at band concerts and baseball games, but they're not the most engaging thing in the world (the band concerts can be downright painful). Now that you're not the parent, your presence doesn't need to be that frequent at those things. Those conversations brought me closer to them as adults. That being said, I think I would've been hurt if they couldn't also point to things they actually enjoyed doing with me as a kid and adult", "Lol, assisted living is pretty bad without someone to check and advocate for you. We pulled my FIL from that path because they almost killed him. I hope you do end up there, with no one to care.", "It wasn't 20 years. For the first 13 he was an every other weekend parent. I don't buy that he didn't have time to live his own life with that visitation regime.", "Crazy thought here: maybe don\u2019t marry another man who hates the child you already have/whom your child hates, so much so that you abandon that child and hand him over to the parent who never wanted him in the first place, but is adult enough to put his own life on hold in order to raise his own child, rather than marrying some other person and not leaving any room for the child you already have? It\u2019s pretty easy not to.", "Would you also say that to a woman? Dont get pregnant if you dont want a child?", "Accidents happen, even if they used birth control. If a woman wants an abortion and the man doesn\u2019t he doesn\u2019t get a say, which is fine her body her choice but if a woman wants to keep the child and the man doesn\u2019t he\u2019s then forced to spend the next 18 years taking care of that child in some way. How is that fair? She wanted to keep their child she should\u2019ve at least been the main one responsible for him but she couldn\u2019t even do that. He set his son up for a good life but now he\u2019s tired of the responsibility, and that\u2019s fine, if I was him I\u2019d try to be more present in the grandkids life but I can\u2019t blame him for not wanting to be.", "Takes 2 to make it, but only 1 to choose to keep it.", "ah yes, the teenage years are the easiest most fun, just chill. and ofcourse we know for a fact he was absolutely not involved at all in his upbringing other than the 2 weekends a month. that's why he definitely didnt attend his sons minor league/extra curriculars, and that's why his son chose to not have contact at 13.... oh wait", "Yea, true.. still a heck of a lot more parenting than a whole lot of kids get, or than a whale of a lot of sperm donors give. He will not be the father of the year (or month or day) but.. he could have just walked away at kids age 13. He didn't.", "Some people are simply not suitable for parenthood, and as long as they recognize it, nothing is wrong with it. It is worse that such people are pressured to be parents and then, if people have less morals than OP, bad things happen to kids.\n\nIt is not wrong to not want to have kids. It is not wrong to want have them. However, society tends to look negatively to ones that do not want kids or parenting. Also, just because you are a parent or grandparent, does not mean it is ALL you are. \n\nNAH . Your son simply does not connect you, active parent he saw all his life, to not so entusiastic grandfather.", "Your comment(s) violate [rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index#wiki_3._accept_your_judgement).

Granted; there are outliers, but if two fully consenting adults agree to have unprotected sex... well the dice will land where they land.", "My point was that OP seems butthurt about what he had to give up to be a parent. The time commitment raising teenagers is nowhere near what it is when the kid is younger. Why does OP now feel he didn\u2019t have time to live his life in his 20s?

OP doesn't want to be a grandparent, he's not morally obligated in any way. Parenting is a different matter, and he did that without complaints/issues from Jake's side (as far as we know atleast). Grandparenting should be an option imo. How many grandparents would involve themselves in *every single matter* of their grandchild's life? Not many, I think.", "Well, at least one of you is happy, huh? Way to salvage the situation.", "He was 21 and probably just thought she was hot.
