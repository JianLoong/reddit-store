I\u2019m not sure about laws and parent rights and everything, but I feel like that is something to consider: that you didn\u2019t want to be a parent. Granted, you had unprotected sex so you are obviously responsible for getting Jake\u2019s mother pregnant, but it\u2019s not really fair to you that you were forced to take care of a child you didn\u2019t want. \n\nAt the same time, though, Jake and Mike are innocent in all this. Neither of them asked to be born. \n\nI think your attitude is understandable, though cold and distant. Not everyone wants to be a parent or grandparent. Both are a lot of work. \n\nI\u2019m wondering since Mike is 5 if he can tell that you don\u2019t want to be in his life, but I bet he can.

As is Mike's mother.\n\nIf I need to give up the next 20 years, and be Daddy again--no. I'll only do it once. This time I'm proverbially getting on the plane to Thailand.  The price is too high. I've done my duty and hung up my parent hat. At this point, yes I am done. I've signed up for and took responsibility for Jake. Jake chose to have Mike, well and good. But now he's the parent. Not me.\n\nAlthough every disagreement on the internet always has going no contact as literally the first port of call, real life isn't like that.  But, because it seems that is what everyone wants to talk about, if let's say that were really what it came down to, so be it. I'd wish him and his family well.  But whether it makes me the asshole or not, I've taken my life back and I'm not going to put it to the side again.\n\nIf the choices are I walk off into the sunset or I have to be daddy again, I am walking off into the sunset. Nobody has threatened such a thing, nor is anyone talking about it.  But this being the internet, it is the go-to that everyone says immediately.  I hope things don't go that way. I don't want them to go that way, but if those are the terms, that will be my choice.", "Indeed you read it right.  I have also considered exactly what you suggest in your last line. Thought very, very hard about it in fact.  \n\nI am far more likely to regret never getting to live my own life, if I were to give that up again.", "No, it doesn't mean I'll tell people that I don't have a son or grandson.  I tell people that freely all the time.  \n\nRather it means that I don't have parental responsibilities anymore. If Mike has a baseball tournament, recital or they need a babysitter, that isn't my department anymore. I see them semi-regularly for visits. If there is some emergency or something, I'll help out.  But I'm doing my own thing and putting my own life first.  Jake is a fully independent adult and he's the father now.  The baseball, recitals, pre-school graduation is all his department now. \n\nDoes that answer your question?", "Your response is actually probably the best fitting and most insightful.  It has never been lost on me that Jake and Mike are innocent. Which is why I did everything I could to conceal how I feel about parenting to Jake although I'm not wearing as much of the mask anymore now that he's an adult.  Jake isn't stupid and I have no question that he's put two and two together and knows that I didn't want to be a father. I'd never say it to him and he hasn't pressed me on it. We just kind of let it lie and I don't think anyone is going to get anything out of poking at that. \n\nThe only time I fully put the mask back on is with Mike. It is a lot easier since it is just maybe a dinner here and there and also younger kids aren't able to see through things like that as easily.  \n\nI have toyed with the idea of moving away. But I've built up a life here. Friends, a GF, clubs, activities. If I didn't have roots, I probably would have. But I just am so done making life decisions around parenting obligations.", ">but you can\u2019t just tell him you\u2019ve checked out of parenting\n\nOh but I did. He doesn't like it. Moreover, yes I actually have stopped parenting. He has a wife, a house and a child. I'm done parenting.\n\nWe have a relationship and see each other semi-regularly.  But it isn't really in the vein of parenting. If let's say some kind of emergency comes up, I'll help him and his family out.  But I am not parenting someone that has their own wife and their own home, nor am I parenting their child.\n\nPerhaps you may find me to be an asshole. But I assure you, I am done parenting and \\*can\\* (and have) said I am checked out of parenting.", "Hahahahaha. What a bs take.\n\nMyself and millions of others would have LOVED to have had a father play such an active role in their lives.", "> Parenthood isn't a job that you retire from.\n\nWatch and see.", "Clearly this guy has made up his mind so I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s even asking for judgment.", "I was and I took responsibility for him. I didn't get on a plane to Thailand and change my name. I raised him to adulthood.", "Indeed, he is and indeed I am. I gave him 20 years of his life, his needs and to a large degree his wants coming first.  That's enough.", ">and still it seems you've been an excellent one\n\nBased on what? He let his son move in when he was 13 after having him every other weekend before that? \"not shirking responsibility\" those things are the bare minimum. Getting him a job? Most parents would if they could. He very well might have been an excellent father. For 8/21 years. But it's a big jump to assume.\n\n And no, no parent who has the kid every other weekend is excellent. Not unless they have been screwed over and are desperately fighting for more custody and trying to rectify the situation. Not a single one of them. It's not possible. He was not excellent before the son moved in that is 100% for sure. So that's more time we *know* he *wasn't* an excellent father than time he might have been one.", "I don't need therapy. I am very clear about who I am, what I've done, what I wish went differently, what I want to be doing and what makes me happy. Throwing thousands of dollars down the drain IS NOT what I want to do with my life.  I don't need that bullshit.\n\nI appreciate your kind words though.", "Oh absolutely.  I don't go THAT far in being hands off.  \n\nI still treat him kindly, get him presents for no reason, do magic tricks for him and so on.  But I think part of it is that Mike's mother's family is super hands on, always there, doing babysitting and is really, really hands on.  I'm not around that much, but when I make sure to do right by Mike.", "Why would I expect that of him?  He is an electrician. Not a doctor. If I'm no longer able to live independently, I expect to go to an assisted living home.\n\nI feel like that's a line people roll out without really thinking through. The reality is that kids don't and can't fairly be expected to \"take care of\" their parents when they are sick. Even if they are willing, they just aren't equipped for it.", "Thanks. I never felt like a good father because I enjoyed so little of it.  I was always a little jealous of the guys where it was like their purpose in life and then their grandchildren were.  I was able to at least act the part with Jake, but I just don't have anything left in the tank to do it again.", "Apparently that isn\u2019t good enough to all people here", "My parents weren't super active in his life, but his mother's parents were fairly active.", "What exactly do you think societal expectations of parents are? Because \u201cfeed, clothe, and home your child\u201d are minimum\nlegal obligations and and preparing your child for adulthood is just barely a step above that.", "If it matters, I still help him out professionally.  A year ago, I got him a spot with an old buddy of mine where because of the nature of the job, there was a 25% premium to the job and they start paying overtime at 33 hours.  It was a 6 month job and he was able to actually get a down payment for a house from all he made. \n\nIt isn't like at his 18th birthday I gave him a carton of cigarettes, a stick to kill game with and a kick out the door.  Hell, he lived with me until he was 20 and only left because he moved in with his now-wife.  I still help him out with things here and there and we have an active relationship. \n\nI'm just not \"Daddy\" anymore, don't have to go to school plays, little league games, babysit, or do childminding related things anymore.", "It\u2019s interesting to call this a modern thing like people weren\u2019t living in multi-generational homes or within short distance of their grandparents and extended family for a huge portion of human history.", "Jake and his wife think so.  I think part of it is that his wife's family was very much that way. Which I do not begrudge and think his wife and her family are lovely people. But I think that is largely where it is coming from.", "> Ok. I've spent 20 years putting Jake first and not really having much of a life.\n\nWhat's that bullshit?! You had him *other weekends* and barely a month in the summer... For the first 13 years you were barely present, why would you blame someone that's not there for stealing your time ... by being absent from your life?", "I very explicitly said \u201cyou might not be the asshole\u201d. So the \u201cif that makes me the asshole, so be it\u201d fake self-flagellation is unnecessary. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, you might think it\u2019s just internet hysteria to suggest going no contact. But I\u2019m not suggesting that your son do that. I just think it\u2019s a possible logical consequence of you saying what you\u2019re saying. He\u2019s telling you the relationship he wants and you\u2019re saying \u201cno\u201d. In any other situation besides parent-child, we would tell someone \u201cif they\u2019re not giving you the relationship you want, you don\u2019t need to have a relationship with them at all\u201d. \n\nAnd even if you\u2019ve never explicitly told him your deep feelings, he knows. He\u2019s not stupid and he\u2019s 100% putting it together now as an adult that you were essentially chomping at the bit to finish your legal obligations to him and step away. It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re comfortable with having a minimal relationship or eventually no relationship with him and his family on your end, but it makes me incredibly sad for him and his kid more than anything else. So I guess congrats on having the life you want now and I\u2019m glad you get to enjoy it.", "But you won't have to \"parent\" his kid though. I'm confused as to why you are thinking of it this way. The main perk of being a grandparent is that you don't have to parent them. You get to do the fun stuff. Have them over, go to see a game, do activities, and then drop them off to their parents, lol. You don't have to make up rules, enforce punishments, make all the hard decisions or anything. I think you're projecting.", "Bruh, even if you didn\u2019t enjoy parenting, do you just not feel any love or compassion for your son!?

I guarantee the reason why your son doesn\u2019t talk to you about it is because he knows you don\u2019t really care. \n\nYou make it seem like being an active parent/grandparent is going to mean sacrificing your happiness and there\u2019s no middle ground.

I think the opposite. I think you've been a GREAT dad because you sacrificed everything, including your own nature, to be a good dad for a child. Also, I think that you're now respecting your nature instead of putting a mask and being falsely grandfather-ish, and I think this is gold, and that the help of a counsellor (a therapist, a nun, a rabbi, whoever you want) would be useful to turn it into a very good lesson for your son, especially if his in laws are so committed to grandparenting, because there's also a lot of social pressure about parenting (and you know it more than me) and being family-ish, so teaching someone that you can be decent (way more than decent) without necessarily being family-ish, that really is a gold lesson and it would be a waste to not convey it", "Look, I get where your coming from, I really do.

You had 80% of your time to yourself. You could have done anything during that time.", "That\u2019s still not giving up your entire life for 20 years my dude. The dramatics here are you.", "And hopefully when you can\u2019t drive and need  to go to the doctor he will be there for you.", "You came onto this Reddit and asked for judgement and you are angry at the kind of judgement you're receiving. \n\nOkaaaaaay.", "You come across as very angry and resentful. I hope you manage to conceal that from your son. You can say all you want that you aren\u2019t angry with him, but you seem like it to strangers on the internet so maybe think about that\u2026", "Here in this silo, our opinions are relevant. But whether or not \u201cgetting him a sweet job\u201d is enough for us, it\u2019s not enough for Jake. He\u2019s explicitly told OP he wants more out of their relationship than a dad who says \u201cI paid my dues, I\u2019m done and I have no responsibility to you anymore\u201d. So even if everyone here thought OP was in the right, which we don\u2019t, his son doesn\u2019t agree and that could impact their relationship.", "NTA.. You forgot.. he took him in fulltime at age 13. Suddenly having a young teener, boy.. not having wanted to be a parent.. he stepped up nicely. Far better than 95% of the sperm donors out there who have 3-4 'baby-mamas' to their credit.\n\nOP, NTA. You've got another 30 years of living.. do your living, have fun, scuba dive.. travel.. nice gifts for BD, Christmas, etc.. once per month have them over for a couple of hours. \n\nChrist, 5 year old sports events are for parents and very engaged family (rarely for friends). Don't force yourself to engage beyond your level of comfort. That will make everyone unhappy and uncomfortable", "OP\u2019s one of those guys who thinks this subreddit is really called \u201cDoIHaveARight?\u201d Not \u201cAmItheAsshole?\u201d", "This man doesn't seem to know what it means to love anyone. Love sacrifices things like time and gives more than it takes. Love happily attends a grandson's Little League game to watch him try his best and have his family there to support him. Love thinks more about giving to others than receiving. This whole post and OP's responses are sad.", "I wouldn't exactly call it selfish. Selfish is when you short someone something they are owed because you put yourself first.  I truly don't feel as if I have a responsibility here.\n\nI also have an odd relationship with that word because 9 out of 10 times, the person bringing it out is actually the selfish one and trying to manipulate you (not saying you are).  Like a common example--someone calls you selfish because you won't give them money. You're selfish because you want to keep what is in your pocket, but they're somehow not selfish because they think they have a right to your cash. My bullshit alarm just goes crazy when I hear that word. Don't take that harshly, I'm just saying I have a thing when it comes to that word.\n\nBut anyway, semantics aside I take your view a lot more seriously since you have walked the same road and probably a harder one.  I do have one difference though which you pick up on.  Which is I never had the \"Dad\" chip in my brain that made me like all the fun stuff. I did it and put on the happiest fact I could with Jake, but it just took everything I had and I don't have any left in the tank to do it again.", "I know-  that few days a year being in the same room as the kid you made shit really takes it\u2019s toll on a guy.\n\nffs - have you ever read such self obsessed crap?", "Like loooooool he \"parented\" on the easiest of easy modes and he keeps crying about how \"burned out\" he is.", "I\u2019ve gone to occasional events for my kids\u2019 FRIENDS because those kids asked me to! Was it often? No! But it meant a lot to them and 2 hours a few times a year didn\u2019t kill me.", "Some people are not cut out for parenting and some plain don't want to. OP did not want a child and he shouldn't be forced to raise one but he did and now he wants his own life NTA", "I appreciate that.  And I love him too and he is important to me. I wasn't cut out to be a father but he's still my son and I love him very much.  \n\nI didn't fake loving him. I faked enjoyed all the parenting stuff.  He was a great kid and is a fine man. But I just burned out all my fuel for doing the parenting stuff with Jake.  It was all I had in the tank, and then some. \n\nI still love him and care about him. I just can't give him what he wants here. Maybe it is a dick thing to do, but one thing I will not do is set false expectations.  Maybe I'm a bastard. But I've never been the kind of bastard to promise things I can't do and then not make good on it.  Maybe I'm an asshole for what I'm doing now, but I won't sink that low.", "I doubt he was fun. He doesn\u2019t like the \u201cfun part\u201d. He was a bitter man fulfilling an obligation he hated then and hates now.", "Yes.  Doing and checking his homework and helping him study for hours was being the \"fun\" dad because his dumb as a stump mother was legit failing the 4th grade material. She thought there were only 5 planets and one was named Europa.", "Right, it's like he resents having been a parent and is wiping his hands of it. Then taking it on on the grandkid", "I wouldn't put that obligation on him.  I'll do the responsible thing and go into assisted living. I've seen how much trouble it causes when someone older can't face up to the reality that they're not able to live independently and try to get their kids to become caretakers.  It never goes well for anybody, in part because it is an unfair thing to ask of them. \n\nAlso I'll tell you another thing.  I have seen so many times where you did have those legit super-moms and super-dads get totally abandoned by their kids when they got infirm.", "I asked for an opinion on whether I was an asshole. Not a tin pot shrink.", "My grandparents weren\u2019t at my games, did they not love me? What a stupid fucking take", "And your responses are stupid.", "My son is 19, my daughter 13 and I'm actually looking forward to have a bit of freedom to just think about what I want soon. It's going to be so weird, I think, since I've never lived in my own place without kids! My son will probably stay home until after college so I have 5-10 years left :) And you're right, probably selfish wasn't the term I should have used. Just putting you first. Shrugs shoulders.", "No I can honestly say I haven\u2019t.. I feel so sorry for the son.. This is one of the saddest posts I\u2019ve read on here", "...dude.\n\n\"Promising\" to love and support your children's children, aka your grandchildren, is part of the basic parenting package. It's so basic that no one, absolutely no one, would go in assuming it's not included.\n\nI'm sorry, you *did* break a promise there.", "It sounds like you live too close to your son. That\u2019s it. Because you are nearby, he thinks you will be available whenever.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should have handled it the way you did though. I think you should apologize, tell him how much you love him and his family, then go hardcore on showing up to events and then move out of state, lol, in maybe 6 months. Then, you will be limited to a few times a year holiday/events instead of weekly kid games.\n\nI say this as a parent of a kid now in their 20s. I hated soccer games, swim meets, and cross country meets. It was like watching paint dry and swallowed up entire weekends. The comments here are off the wall crazy. For the sake of family harmony, you should never live in the same state as relatives who will suck your life out of you. If you don\u2019t move away, you will be expected to help with yard work, home improvements, school tutoring, etc, etc. Back in the day, my grandparents never lived in the same state as us- because they were smart. Be smarter.\n\nIm in my 50s and I want to be a guest who visits and spoils them when I come, not a maid or a landscaper or painter or mover for all my relatives.", "It was every other weekend, dude. For almost 3/4  his childhood, you were only actually parenting for \\~two days every two weeks, and then one month in the summer SOMETIMES. I'm sorry but the whole \"i had NO LIFE!!!\" schtick is hilarious. Skill issue-- you literally avoided the majority of strenuous childcare. \"I lost 20 years\" you lost a little more than two months a year because you risked it for the biscuit on your own accord? You got off easy! \n\n you're more dramatic than my teenage sister. That's a feat!", "You\u2019re the dummy who knocked her up. Can\u2019t make you too smart.", "I took care of both my parents for the last ten years of their lives. I raised my son mostly by myself and it was the single most greatest joy of my life. I\u2019m sorry that parenting was so horrible for you. I\u2019d give anything to go back and do it all over again", "Oh, ok. Yeah. YTA. I don't have to explain why.", "Probably not. I wouldn\u2019t if you were my grandkid.", "How come you posted here in the first place?", "You were too stupid to figure out a condom.", "But he never wanted to be a parent and never signed up for it. You can say it's part of the package all you want--he never wanted the package. I don't understand why you keep acting like he wanted ot signed up for this. He didn't even want Jake. Why on earth would he want his kid too, when he didn't even sign up for being a dad?", "Get Fucked loser", "Because he intentionally made Jake *believe* that he fully signed up to parent him.\n\nAnd by doing that, OP absolutely *did* set up \"false expectations\" in Jake.", "And?"]}
