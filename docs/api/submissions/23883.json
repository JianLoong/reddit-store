Jake's mother and I only had a short-term relationship and it was an accidental pregnancy.  To be blunt, I never wanted to be a parent, particularly not at 21. However, Jake's mother did and it wasn't my decision. Although we have always kept the peace, things have always been icy between us due to that. \r  \n\r  \nHowever, I always tried to do right by Jake. I would have him every other weekend and for a month during the summer, would do my best to deliver on anything he asked of me, treated him kindly and tried to be a good father. Then at a certain point, his mother married a guy Jake hated and I had him move in with me once he was 13. I won't lie, I wasn't cut out to be a parent. I love Jake, but I just hated parenting. I did it anyway since he was my son. We have a very good relationship, and I've never shirked any responsibility to him. \r  \n\r  \nJake also became a father at 21. However, he was all for it and is happily married to Mike's mother. I also got him into my electrician's union and had him set up on some good jobs. So, he was on much, much better footing than I was for a child.  Back then, we had a long talk and I told him \"Jake, being a parent is a very, very different life. It is hard, exhausting and on a day-to-day basis, you don't really get to do what you want to do very much. It will be a very long time before you don't have that kind of responsibility anymore.\" \n\nThen the conversation turned to how I'd help him.  I told him no. I am retired from parenting. I am turning back to my own life. He has his own home, union job, is engaged, and adult enough to decide to have a baby. He's the adult now. He's the parent.  I'll be around and if there are any emergencies, obviously I'll do what I can.  But I won't be an \"active\" grandparent. \r  \n\r  \nI've largely held to it. I have been doing a lot of travel, I have a GF, hobbies and to be blunt, I'm doing all the things I didn't get to do in my 20s. Do I see Jake and his family? Yes. However, I rarely agree to babysit. Jake resents that I don't go to Mike's games (they tend to conflict with my weightlifting club) and that I'm pretty hands off with Mike.  Things came to a head last week when Mike had a baseball tournament and I refused to go because I had plans to take a scuba class with my GF (which admittedly could be rescheduled). I didn't tell Jake this, but I spent so many Saturdays bored out of my skull watching little league when Jake was little. I always cheered loudly, was crazy supportive and never let on that it was like watching paint dry. But this is no longer my responsibility. \r  \n\r  \nSo I told him \"Jake, I spent 20 years parenting. That's enough.\" He then yelled at me that I am always jetting around, playing like a teenager and not putting him first.  I told him that no, I wasn't. I did that for 20 years to get him on his feet as an adult.

I\u2019m not sure about laws and parent rights and everything, but I feel like that is something to consider: that you didn\u2019t want to be a parent. Granted, you had unprotected sex so you are obviously responsible for getting Jake\u2019s mother pregnant, but it\u2019s not really fair to you that you were forced to take care of a child you didn\u2019t want. \n\nAt the same time, though, Jake and Mike are innocent in all this. Neither of them asked to be born. \n\nI think your attitude is understandable, though cold and distant. Not everyone wants to be a parent or grandparent. Both are a lot of work. \n\nI\u2019m wondering since Mike is 5 if he can tell that you don\u2019t want to be in his life, but I bet he can. You can be hands-off, and you don\u2019t have to babysit, but the little dude is innocent and probably caught on that you don\u2019t really love him. \n\nHonestly, I think your best bet is to move farther away and use that as an excuse.

Even if you don't baby sit or go to the less important games tournaments are huge. Think of how Mike feels seeing his friends grandparents showing up but grandpa won't. This can really damage a grandchild because they can end up feeling like you don't love them. Even if you don't go to the basic games imo you shpuld show up for the major ones.

You have stated you are actually ok with being TA. So why the question? Own it. Do what you want to do. \n\nIt IS very self centered, it does hurt your son and grandson.

I did it because I fathered a child, he couldn't take care of himself and it was my responsibility. Jake is fully able to take care of himself and Mike. As is Mike's mother.\n\nIf I need to give up the next 20 years, and be Daddy again--no. I'll only do it once. This time I'm proverbially getting on the plane to Thailand.  The price is too high. I've done my duty and hung up my parent hat. At this point, yes I am done. I've signed up for and took responsibility for Jake. Jake chose to have Mike, well and good. But now he's the parent. Not me.\n\nAlthough every disagreement on the internet always has going no contact as literally the first port of call, real life isn't like that.  But, because it seems that is what everyone wants to talk about, if let's say that were really what it came down to, so be it. I'd wish him and his family well.  But whether it makes me the asshole or not, I've taken my life back and I'm not going to put it to the side again.\n\nIf the choices are I walk off into the sunset or I have to be daddy again, I am walking off into the sunset. Nobody has threatened such a thing, nor is anyone talking about it.  But this being the internet, it is the go-to that everyone says immediately.  I hope things don't go that way. I don't want them to go that way, but if those are the terms, that will be my choice.", "Indeed you read it right.  I have also considered exactly what you suggest in your last line. Thought very, very hard about it in fact.  \n\nI am far more likely to regret never getting to live my own life, if I were to give that up again.", "No, it doesn't mean I'll tell people that I don't have a son or grandson.  I tell people that freely all the time.  \n\nRather it means that I don't have parental responsibilities anymore. If Mike has a baseball tournament, recital or they need a babysitter, that isn't my department anymore. I see them semi-regularly for visits. If there is some emergency or something, I'll help out.  But I'm doing my own thing and putting my own life first.  Jake is a fully independent adult and he's the father now.  The baseball, recitals, pre-school graduation is all his department now. \n\nDoes that answer your question?", "Your response is actually probably the best fitting and most insightful.  It has never been lost on me that Jake and Mike are innocent. Which is why I did everything I could to conceal how I feel about parenting to Jake although I'm not wearing as much of the mask anymore now that he's an adult.  Jake isn't stupid and I have no question that he's put two and two together and knows that I didn't want to be a father. I'd never say it to him and he hasn't pressed me on it. We just kind of let it lie and I don't think anyone is going to get anything out of poking at that. \n\nThe only time I fully put the mask back on is with Mike. It is a lot easier since it is just maybe a dinner here and there and also younger kids aren't able to see through things like that as easily.  \n\nI have toyed with the idea of moving away. But I've built up a life here. Friends, a GF, clubs, activities. If I didn't have roots, I probably would have. But I just am so done making life decisions around parenting obligations.", ">but you can\u2019t just tell him you\u2019ve checked out of parenting\n\nOh but I did. He doesn't like it. Moreover, yes I actually have stopped parenting. He has a wife, a house and a child. I'm done parenting.\n\nWe have a relationship and see each other semi-regularly.  But it isn't really in the vein of parenting. If let's say some kind of emergency comes up, I'll help him and his family out.  But I am not parenting someone that has their own wife and their own home, nor am I parenting their child.\n\nPerhaps you may find me to be an asshole. But I assure you, I am done parenting and \\*can\\* (and have) said I am checked out of parenting.", "Hahahahaha. What a bs take.\n\nMyself and millions of others would have LOVED to have had a father play such an active role in their lives.", "> Parenthood isn't a job that you retire from.\n\nWatch and see.", "Clearly this guy has made up his mind so I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s even asking for judgment.", "I was and I took responsibility for him. I didn't get on a plane to Thailand and change my name. I raised him to adulthood.", "Indeed, he is and indeed I am. I gave him 20 years of his life, his needs and to a large degree his wants coming first.  That's enough.", ">and still it seems you've been an excellent one\n\nBased on what? He let his son move in when he was 13 after having him every other weekend before that? \"not shirking responsibility\" those things are the bare minimum. Getting him a job? Most parents would if they could. He very well might have been an excellent father. For 8/21 years. But it's a big jump to assume.\n\n And no, no parent who has the kid every other weekend is excellent. Not unless they have been screwed over and are desperately fighting for more custody and trying to rectify the situation. Not a single one of them. It's not possible. He was not excellent before the son moved in that is 100% for sure. So that's more time we *know* he *wasn't* an excellent father than time he might have been one.", "I don't need therapy. I am very clear about who I am, what I've done, what I wish went differently, what I want to be doing and what makes me happy. Throwing thousands of dollars down the drain IS NOT what I want to do with my life.  I don't need that bullshit.\n\nI appreciate your kind words though.", "Oh absolutely.  I don't go THAT far in being hands off.  \n\nI still treat him kindly, get him presents for no reason, do magic tricks for him and so on.  But I think part of it is that Mike's mother's family is super hands on, always there, doing babysitting and is really, really hands on.  I'm not around that much, but when I make sure to do right by Mike.", "Why would I expect that of him?  He is an electrician. Not a doctor. If I'm no longer able to live independently, I expect to go to an assisted living home.\n\nI feel like that's a line people roll out without really thinking through. The reality is that kids don't and can't fairly be expected to \"take care of\" their parents when they are sick. Even if they are willing, they just aren't equipped for it.", "Thanks. I never felt like a good father because I enjoyed so little of it.  I was always a little jealous of the guys where it was like their purpose in life and then their grandchildren were.  I was able to at least act the part with Jake, but I just don't have anything left in the tank to do it again.", "Apparently that isn\u2019t good enough to all people here", "My parents weren't super active in his life, but his mother's parents were fairly active.", "What exactly do you think societal expectations of parents are?

A year ago, I got him a spot with an old buddy of mine where because of the nature of the job, there was a 25% premium to the job and they start paying overtime at 33 hours.  It was a 6 month job and he was able to actually get a down payment for a house from all he made. \n\nIt isn't like at his 18th birthday I gave him a carton of cigarettes, a stick to kill game with and a kick out the door.  Hell, he lived with me until he was 20 and only left because he moved in with his now-wife.  I still help him out with things here and there and we have an active relationship. \n\nI'm just not \"Daddy\" anymore, don't have to go to school plays, little league games, babysit, or do childminding related things anymore.", "It\u2019s interesting to call this a modern thing like people weren\u2019t living in multi-generational homes or within short distance of their grandparents and extended family for a huge portion of human history.", "Jake and his wife think so.  I think part of it is that his wife's family was very much that way. Which I do not begrudge and think his wife and her family are lovely people. But I think that is largely where it is coming from.", "> Ok. I've spent 20 years putting Jake first and not really having much of a life.\n\nWhat's that bullshit?! You had him *other weekends* and barely a month in the summer... For the first 13 years you were barely present, why would you blame someone that's not there for stealing your time ... by being absent from your life?", "I very explicitly said \u201cyou might not be the asshole\u201d. So the \u201cif that makes me the asshole, so be it\u201d fake self-flagellation is unnecessary. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, you might think it\u2019s just internet hysteria to suggest going no contact. But I\u2019m not suggesting that your son do that. I just think it\u2019s a possible logical consequence of you saying what you\u2019re saying. He\u2019s telling you the relationship he wants and you\u2019re saying \u201cno\u201d. In any other situation besides parent-child, we would tell someone \u201cif they\u2019re not giving you the relationship you want, you don\u2019t need to have a relationship with them at all\u201d. \n\nAnd even if you\u2019ve never explicitly told him your deep feelings, he knows. He\u2019s not stupid and he\u2019s 100% putting it together now as an adult that you were essentially chomping at the bit to finish your legal obligations to him and step away. It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re comfortable with having a minimal relationship or eventually no relationship with him and his family on your end, but it makes me incredibly sad for him and his kid more than anything else. So I guess congrats on having the life you want now and I\u2019m glad you get to enjoy it.", "But you won't have to \"parent\" his kid though. I'm confused as to why you are thinking of it this way. The main perk of being a grandparent is that you don't have to parent them. You get to do the fun stuff. Have them over, go to see a game, do activities, and then drop them off to their parents, lol. You don't have to make up rules, enforce punishments, make all the hard decisions or anything. I think you're projecting.", "Bruh, even if you didn\u2019t enjoy parenting, do you just not feel any love or compassion for your son!?

I think the opposite. I think you've been a GREAT dad because you sacrificed everything, including your own nature, to be a good dad for a child. Also, I think that you're now respecting your nature instead of putting a mask and being falsely grandfather-ish, and I think this is gold, and that the help of a counsellor (a therapist, a nun, a rabbi, whoever you want) would be useful to turn it into a very good lesson for your son, especially if his in laws are so committed to grandparenting, because there's also a lot of social pressure about parenting (and you know it more than me) and being family-ish, so teaching someone that you can be decent (way more than decent) without necessarily being family-ish, that really is a gold lesson and it would be a waste to not convey it", "Look, I get where your coming from, I really do.

He's thought all this time you cared, you'd be active in his life, kids life, be a typical grandpa, based on his childhood he probably assumed, and the rug got yanked out from under him, he's probably pouring over in his mind, looking for the signs when he was younger, that he was nothing more than an accident you had to give 18 years to, then never be bothered again.

Grandparents babysitting isn\u2019t guaranteed is my point and if he wants a night off work some OT and get a baby sitter. It\u2019s hard but if you want a break it\u2019s gonna take a little extra effort and isn\u2019t always able to be dropped on the grandparents.

So by now being a non active parent you've shattering your sons view of his childhood and his previous involvement in his life. I'm sure it would really hurt him that you appeared to enjoy these things for him but not for the son that he loves. It sounds like your son hasn't accepted your explanations because that then means a whole bunch of his childhood was faked. And really there's no right or wrong, but if I was in this scenario I can understand the hurt your son would be experiencing. And I think emotionally that's why it feels from the outside looking in your being selfish, \"why can't you just go to the odd activity once every 2 months\" despite not knowing what it's like to sacrifice the amount of time that you did to make those times for your own son.", ">Selfish is when you short someone something they are owed because you put yourself first.\n\nYou are shorting your son and your grandson though. Don't get me wrong, I agree with you on the rest and you are NTA here, but you are definitly selfish. Just not in the standard toxic sense that everyone nowadays associates being selfish with.\n\nThe definition of selfish (from cambridge dictionary) is \"caring only about what you want or need without any thought for the needs or wishes of other people\", which is what you are doing here. You are thinking of what you want and what you need (rightfully so), and putting that above the needs and wishes of your son and grandson. Again, I understand why, but you can't say it's not selfish. \n\nNow you could, for instance, compromise and say once every 2 months or so, you'd sacrifice your time to accomodate your son and grandson, that would be selfless, you don't have to ofcourse if you don't want to, I just added it as food for thought in case you're interested.\n\nLastly and only because it's mentioned a lot in the comments: don't listen to anyone that says you did the bare minimum.

They're not. \n\nYears back, when my sis' son was young, her ILs were quite generous in watching him on days where daycare was closed and my sis and BIL still had to work. There was one holiday that came up where her IL's wanted to attend a senior center meeting in the morning and go to a prayer service in the afternoon, so they told my sis that they wouldn't be available to watch her son that day so she'd need to make other arrangements. My sis was LIVID because, in her opinion, what her ILs were doing wasn't \"necessary\" (ie, an obligation), but rather something they *wanted* to do *with their own time.* My mother caught wind of my sister's anger/annoyance, sat her down and made it very clear that her in-laws were the ones doing HER a favor, their days were theirs to spend *as they wish* and ultimately childcare was the responsibility of her and her husband, not her in-laws. She needed to get off her high horse of entitlement and be grateful that her inlaws helped her with childcare *at all*.\n\nPoint of my story here is that some kids have this overinflated sense that grandparents want to spend lots of time with their grandkids and be involved in every facet of their lives. Sometimes, that's just not the case and they want to spend their time doing their own thing after years of raising kids, working, etc. and not be at someone else's beck and call. \n\nJust some food for thought.", "I'm so ready for the hate this is gonna get.\n\nI swear every other day on Reddit, a woman asks ATIA for not wanting to babysit my grandchild?

You should stop blaming your kid, your ex, for being a dad and stop blaming your grandkid for being a grandparent.\n\nIf your kid had a choice, and his kid had a choice they probably wouldn\u2019t choose you either and frankly neither had a bigger say so in it than you.

Just go and enjoy the scuba diving, and go see the world, the  ocean hasn\u2019t banned assholes, and no country that I know of has banned them either. And who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll get to do all the things you didn\u2019t do in your forties in your sixties like being a decent dad or grandad, or just, you know,  growing the fuck up. \nDefinitely get out more and definitely be even more adventurous, I mean hell, you seem pretty comfortable dropping the ball so you might as well join a bowling league. \n\nI\u2019ve seen your type, never satisfied, always convinced they\u2019re missing out, forever 21s, I call them.

Makes you feel alive. Keeps up with your energy. Gets you. And the excuses, oh my, the excuses. Like when I read your post I nearly missed the part where no one held you down and shoved your penis into your exes  vagina. Which is weird because the whole thing makes it pretty clear that like someone made you get someone pregnant so I guess don\u2019t leave that out next time. 20\nWhole years of your life wasted being a parent too.  Four days a month dude you weren\u2019t a parent for 20 years, you were a fucking nanny for the first 13. And you\u2019re out here acting like your son robbed you of your life? Like, that was four days a month dude. We all know it was probably even less than that too. It sounds to me like you were free to live the life you wanted for most of it and simply lived the one you deserved. \n\nI\u2019m 33. And I\u2019m really embarrassed for you dude. That\u2019s the truth. Like you\u2019re literally online trying to whine your way out of your responsibility. And then hiding behind the facade of an adventurous life- to skirt your responsibilities.

No one wants to be in someone else's life from a sense of duty. People want to be deeply loved for who they are and out of a spontaneous emotional inclination.

Obviously, you can't fake that emotional reaction, so that's kind of a moot point, and yes having a child is an awful lot of responsibility and impacts a lot about your life, but I certainly would not expect anyone online to coddle you in your desire to live out a bunch of recreational activities in favour of being a grandparent, even though it is your prerogative to do so.\n\nYou may love your GF and love the opportunity to be engaged in meaningful activities - that is a super important part of life. However, the part of you that will live on is not those activities, it is your son and now grandchild. And possibly when you are older and no longer able to go scuba diving, and the GFs move on, the investment in those relationships with your son and grandson will suddenly feel more important, I don't know. \n\nI won't say you are an asshole, but I will say there might be further levels of self and relational depth you can achieve, if you are really focused on developing yourself in new ways. A good compromise might be to find a special activity which you can share with your grandson and ensure that even if you don't see him often or have sort of a day to day relationship that he still gets a meaningful qualitative experience with you.

I love my kids, I wanted my kids. I absolutely hated all of that crap. Finger nails down a blackboard, chewing on aluminum foil, mosquito buzzing in your ear hated it. All the other parents would be cooing and laughing and thinking it was so cute and I\u2019m bored out of my mind. It is not an automatic part of parenthood to enjoy that kind of thing. Once my kids (and the others) had some skill in what ever they chose to do, then I could enjoy going. High school band concerts sure, 5th grade band concerts- do you think they\u2019d notice if I have ear plugs. \nThere is nothing wrong as a grandparent to decline to attend those things you won\u2019t enjoy attending. There is nothing wrong as a grandparent to not be into the little kid phase. If OP isn\u2019t actively hostile to his grandson and keeps even a little connection, then when his grandson gets to an age where he can join in on the things OP enjoys doing they can build more of a relationship then. Plenty of kids only see their grandparents a few times a year and have a decent relationship. \n\nOP I think part of the issue your son is having is reconciling his memories of you being enthusiastic with the reality that he now knows you didn\u2019t enjoy those activities. He may have also had a vision of going to games etc with you that is now dashed. As other people have said he may be stuck on if you faked that did you fake loving him. I think it might go a long way to helping him understand to tell him you went to all that stuff and faked enjoyment BECAUSE you love him and wanted him to feel supported. But HIS son has HIM for that, you want a relationship with your grandson and future grandkids that is a lot more on your terms. Like other people have said, the fun part of being a grandparent is you only have to do the fun stuff. YOU get to decide what is the fun stuff for you.

Instead he's pointing out that OP often waxes poetic about how much effort he put into raising his son (including when he tells his son how hard parenting is), practically comparing himself to a single father raising 3 kids by the way he talks about it.\n\nHe's not really an AH for not being able to find it in himself to parent anymore and being honest about that, probably better than resentment. He's an AH because he makes it sound like he suffered oh so greatly. It's like if someone told you that they have a really physical job and you find out that they work a desk job, but then instead of admitting that maybe their job isn't that physical and they might have done health issues that are making them feel tired after work they bring up little anecdotes about moving some boxes one time.", "And accidents happen my guy.

In some cases I think yes - a very small amount of contact may be actively worse for a child than none at all, since makes it much harder for the child to move on from the cycle of hope vs abandonment. But I'm not a child psychologist in any sense, so I may be off-base on that.\n\nIn general, my feeling is that taking active responsibility for humans you bring into the world - including regular, quality time, not just financial support - is the ethical minimum.

It's absolute ground level, and means basically nothing to a kid's experience of their childhood - money is necessary to raise a child, but most of the time a kid has little direct awareness of it. Quality time is what makes the difference to a child's development.", "That depends on how much you don't like something. He could clearly suck it up and do what was asked from him but that doesn't it can't drain you of energy to always have to be there even though you don't like it. And as OP has said in a few comments, and what people could have guessed too, is that every other weekend doesn't mean exactly that. Kid needs to go sports, you can drive. Mother has to step out for a bit, dad has to come over. \nYou see that as 'minimal effort' but for someone being forced into a job you never wanted, doesn't like, but can't get out off, it can be as tiresome as a full time parent. That's not the same for everyone. For instance, people work in sales 5 days a week for 20 years. Put me, forcefully, in sales even for 2 days every other week for 20 years, tell me I have to be there and can't quit, I'm going to be exhausted. Bloody sales..", "This spoke to me more than you'll know.  I had step-parents who didn't want me around and as a child you can feel this.  I also had a father who only wanted to be around for the fun stuff.  Not being able to rely on a parent for the harder things causes so many internal issues.  Sounds like Jake's dad is a fun-time dad, a dad that doesn't want to put in effort unless the direct result is self-enjoyment.", "he also *did* have the choice to not get involved, to just pay child support, but he *chose* to be a parent. you\u2019re either in or you\u2019re out and he *chose* to be in", "No, but he took 100% for the teenage years.", "NTA.  \nI'm astounded by the hate OP is getting. Sure, he's a bit cold towards his grown up son, but fucking hell he's no monster. If your son and grandson want to spend time with you perhaps you can do something that all of you like to do? Go snorkeling or something? Be his cool grandad that takes him out and do active things? If it's that super important that you get to meet your grandson then I'm sure they come up with something that works?\n\nJust because you don't want to sit through shitty kids sports games (i would die...) doesnt mean you can't have an excellent relationship with you grandson. When he gets a bit older you can probably have a great time together every now and then.  \nThe same with being a nanny, the kid has two parents, and 3 other grandparents who I assume are more interested in kids. At least his grandma that was the sons mother.  \n\n\nSure, OP wasn't \"there\" for the first 13 years for his son which was EXACTLY what both parents wanted. But the son's loving mother was, and she was all fine with that until she choose to live with another man over her own child. She didn't have to live together with the new guy, they could could still have been together but live apart, but she chose to put her son with a man (ie OP) she knew wasn't that interested in kids. How considerate of her.  \n\n\nThen OP does his duty as a parent who never wanted to be one in the first place. And seems to do fucking good job for someone who doesnt want to do that exact job. That could not have been easy, in fact that strikes me as something incredibly hard to do. Perhaps he seems a bit focused on the \"wordly matters\" of his sons upbringing, but the kid was 13, not a toddler. And he still had his loving mother around right, they could still meet right?  \n\n\nAnd it's not like OP flat out refuses to meet his grandson, he just doesn't want to 1) be a nanny 2) show up to little league and put on his old mask again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the most important thing here is OP's relationship with his son, not the grandson.
