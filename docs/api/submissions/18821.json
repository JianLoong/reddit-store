{"id": 18821, "submission_id": "13yt1jz", "title": "AITA for 'humiliating' my MIL?", "selftext": "I have just had a son with my husband. We named our son after my dad, who passed away a few years ago. The name is from my culture and MIL said she didn't like it at first as she said our son would struggle later with that name. I politely told her that I had named him after my dad, and that the name represents his heritage. MIL constantly calls son by a nickname and shortens it as she said it was hard to pronounce, despite me telling her not to. She has carried on calling son by a shorter name, and even when talking to others, or introducing her grandson, she calls him the nickname. It was her birthday yesterday and I got her a necklace she had always wanted as well as a set of phonic books. She was confused when she opened it, and I explained it was because she struggled to pronounce son's name. She is now upset that I humiliated her on her birthday and wants an apology. The only people present when the gift was being opened was me, her, our son and my husband. My husband agrees MIL was in the wrong for not calling son by his actual name, but that I should have approached the situation differently. MIL has told everyone, included extended family how I disrespected her in her own house. AITA?\n\neta- it is not a name that is hard to pronounce, just uncommon. Nobody I have told has found it hard to pronounce and MIL had pronounced the full name before when talking to my dad. I have read a few of the comments and wanted to clarify why the nickname bothers me, it is a common American girls name, and does not reflect the culture like I wanted his name to. I also feel she is disrespecting my dad's name by refusing to call him by his full name. I am aware that as my son grows up, he might have people call him a nickname, but I think his family should learn his full name at least.", "created_utc": 1685747736, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yt1jz/aita_for_humiliating_my_mil/", "score": 4642, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother-in-law is acting childish by not calling her grandson by his actual name especially since you have reminded her over and over again. Has your husband talk to her about this?

It's disappointing that your husband didn't step in at the start to put a stop to this. It was a superbly passive aggressive way to deliver your message, but I would've asked my husband to speak to her (though it would show such weakness on his part to have to be asked).

We named our son after my dad, who passed away a few years ago. The name is from my culture and MIL said she didn't like it at first as she said our son would struggle later with that name. I politely told her that I had named him after my dad, and that the name represents his heritage. MIL constantly calls son by a nickname and shortens it as she said it was hard to pronounce, despite me telling her not to. She has carried on calling son by a shorter name, and even when talking to others, or introducing her grandson, she calls him the nickname. It was her birthday yesterday and I got her a necklace she had always wanted as well as a set of phonic books. She was confused when she opened it, and I explained it was because she struggled to pronounce son's name. She is now upset that I humiliated her on her birthday and wants an apology. The only people present when the gift was being opened was me, her, our son and my husband.

Last name? how you refer to someone is such a cultural thing and there isn't a \"standard\" way of doing it correctly.\n\nI n my country, you know someone likes you if they've shortened your name, even if it makes no sense.  So \"Amy\" becomes \"Aims\".\n\nI only ever hear my full name said correctly when i'm getting into trouble. I like being given a nickname, and it's a sign of affection to give someone a nickname.  And its incomprehensible to me to get offended over the grandmother giving their grandson/daughter a nickname.\n\nPut it this way.. if you called your kid \"john\".. but my memories of \"jonn\" is of that guy that raped me.. do you blame me for calling your kid \"J\" or \"jay\" or \"frank\" (the name itself doesn't matter, as long as it's not rude or offensive) or anything else that doesn't remind me of my trauma.... or would you insist that i continue to call him john? \n\nMy point is there are justifications for not using his real name and using a nickname, and they're typically designed to avoid drama. What OP is doing is insisting on using the name that causes drama, because she prefers it. \n\nThis isn't a stranger either, this is the grandmother.
