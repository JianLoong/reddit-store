{"id": 18821, "submission_id": "13yt1jz", "title": "AITA for 'humiliating' my MIL?", "selftext": "I have just had a son with my husband. We named our son after my dad, who passed away a few years ago. The name is from my culture and MIL said she didn't like it at first as she said our son would struggle later with that name. I politely told her that I had named him after my dad, and that the name represents his heritage. MIL constantly calls son by a nickname and shortens it as she said it was hard to pronounce, despite me telling her not to. She has carried on calling son by a shorter name, and even when talking to others, or introducing her grandson, she calls him the nickname. It was her birthday yesterday and I got her a necklace she had always wanted as well as a set of phonic books. She was confused when she opened it, and I explained it was because she struggled to pronounce son's name. She is now upset that I humiliated her on her birthday and wants an apology. The only people present when the gift was being opened was me, her, our son and my husband. My husband agrees MIL was in the wrong for not calling son by his actual name, but that I should have approached the situation differently. MIL has told everyone, included extended family how I disrespected her in her own house. AITA?\n\neta- it is not a name that is hard to pronounce, just uncommon. Nobody I have told has found it hard to pronounce and MIL had prononuced the full name before when talking to my dad. I have read a few of the comments and wanted to clarify why the nickname bothers me, it is a common American girls name, and does not reflect the culture like I wanted his name to. I also feel she is disrespecting my dad's name by refusing to call him by his full name. I am aware that as my son grows up, he might have people call him a nickname, but I think his family should learn his full name at least.", "created_utc": 1685747736, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yt1jz/aita_for_humiliating_my_mil/", "score": 2113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother-in-law is acting childish by not calling her grandson by his actual name especially since you have reminded her over and over again. Has your husband talk to her about this?

It's disappointing that your husband didn't step in at the start to put a stop to this.

We named our son after my dad, who passed away a few years ago. The name is from my culture and MIL said she didn't like it at first as she said our son would struggle later with that name. I politely told her that I had named him after my dad, and that the name represents his heritage. MIL constantly calls son by a nickname and shortens it as she said it was hard to pronounce, despite me telling her not to. She has carried on calling son by a shorter name, and even when talking to others, or introducing her grandson, she calls him the nickname. It was her birthday yesterday and I got her a necklace she had always wanted as well as a set of phonic books. She was confused when she opened it, and I explained it was because she struggled to pronounce son's name. She is now upset that I humiliated her on her birthday and wants an apology. The only people present when the gift was being opened was me, her, our son and my husband. My husband agrees MIL was in the wrong for not calling son by his actual name, but that I should have approached the situation differently.

Her daughter-in-law knew about the gift.\n\nIMO she only got humiliated because she spread the word about the private present. But yes, it was a little passive-aggressive.", "How is it passive aggressive to take MIL at her word?", "I used to teach at a school that had a lot of foreign students, many with names I did not know how to pronounce. I just wrote them out phonetically on the roster. If I can remember 20+  unfamiliar foreign names and their pronunciations, surely MIL can do it for just one grandchild.", "This is the part I'm fixated on. Why wasn't the husband in charge of the gifts for his own mom???", "Eh. Who cares.", "I mean, it's a direct response to MIL's excuse why she wanted to use a nickname... If you have difficulty with it (obviously a lie, but letting you have it), then the book should help with that, right?\n\nI didn't know it was passive aggressive to take people at their word...\n\nNTA, MIL needs to grow up if she wants to continue having a relationship with her grandson", "It\u2019s hilarious but definitely not \u201crather mature\u201d", "Okay, so when this doesn't work, what's her next gambit?  Beating her chest and handling things like a caveman?  I don't think regression is the solution here (nor is trusting Redditors to evaluate maturity, but that's a whole other matter).", ">MIL constantly calls son by a nickname and shortens it as she said it was hard to pronounce, despite me telling her not to\n\nShe did mention correcting her. Dunno if that was part of an edit or not", "With regards to MIL using a nickname OP literally wrote \"despite me telling her not to\". Did you want an itemized list with time stamped recordings of every time OP tried to politely resolve this like an adult?", "Ya know a fun way to call out someone on their racist bs? Calling them out on their racist BS. Not being cute and giving a phonics book as quirky little zinger like you're a character in a jnomil fanfic.", "Well yeah, obv.", "\"I'm having trouble with pronouncing that name\"\n\"Okay, here's a book that can help with that\"\n\nHow is this intentionally humiliating, unless the first person is lying? If they're telling the truth, the book would be helpful and she had an out to correct her behavior without having to admit she was lying.", "She can't control what comes out of MILs mouth. The mother will do more harm to the child by making a big stink out of the nickname rather than just moving on.", "That's not the issue here. MIL is rude and quite possibly racist, but 2 wrongs don't make a right. This isn't the way to make her point. She asked if she was TA for giving a clearly passive aggressive gift in front of a bunch of people and the answer is yes.", "don\u2019t think MIL sucks as much as OP. but thanks for looking out", "What is esh???", "The thing as well though is that the nickname thing might well be a losing battle. If the name is long or even a bit hard to pronounce, kids are going to use a nickname. Hell, the kid may well end up using a nickname themselves that mom will hate. \n\nLots of parents pick special (but impractical) names for kids and then said kids end up doing their own versions of the name and pissing off the parents. And parents can\u2019t mandate it.\n\nNow she\u2019s fine to try and insist with her MiL, but I have a feeling she\u2019s not going to handle it well if the kid or friends end up doing something differently.", "I mean, this was an attempt to correct the behavior without threatening to take access to her grandchildren away, which can go nuclear real fast just for the threat depending on the person. This seemed more like offering her an out to correct her own behavior without forcing her to admit she was lying about struggling with the pronunciation.", "How many times does she have to say that before y\u2019all stop giving racist grandma the go ahead to be racist? OP said she already tried to correct her. Multiple times. Does she have to hold her hand and go \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to stop being racist. But please?\u201d Like my God", "You think this way is gonna work?", "Especially when she did it all to herself.  She could have just used the name properly and, later, not told anyone about her \"humiliating\" gift.", "As a manager, I have trouble pronouncing unique and beautiful names.  For that reason, I may not hire someone when all skills are equal. (Hey, just being honest).  Does your child have a middle name that is easier to pronounce?  No big deal with a nickname, I am sure your wife wants her child to fit in.  When your child gets older, he can chose to use whatever name.", "That was my impression as well.", "And the post says the nickname is a common American girl's name. That might not have been a problem except MIL already lied about the boy's real name being hard to pronounce... I think the MIL is trying to insult some people...", "Or woman", "He may have been handling it in a different matter but his mother is just a disrespectful ass. I\u2019m wondering if he said it could\u2019ve been handled differently when it happened or after his mother went running her mouth to everyone and now they have to deal with family asking them what\u2019s up?", "It also could be HIS culture that you don't speak out against your mom. Not saying its ok but that's pretty common worldwide.", "Maybe he should have been aware of what the gift they got his mom was", "Mental labor is real labor, yo. What else is OP carrying the load for?", "Never after we were married, did my EX pick out gifts for either of his parents.  Yep he  was the absolutely laziest person I  knew.  \n\nIn order to get any descent Christmas gifts, he would shop with a friend of mine, and then he HAD to reward himself with a milkshake .", "My ex husband never picked out gifts for his family. If they were getting anything, it was because I bought it. Some people just don't care.", "She might have picked out a gift on her own, I know pick out gifts for my [future] MIL while my girlfriend also picks out gifts for her. Not super uncommon I would imagine.", "I feel like husbands rarely know the gifts for anyone, including their immediate family. It\u2019s just their name written on the card.", "Does it say that the son didn\u2019t get her a gift as well? The text reads that OP got her a necklace she always wanted. I know many couples where each one gives a gift to people, not a conjoined one.", "The necklace was the real gift, he probably had a hand in that then the wife added the phonetic book.", "I\u2019m going off of a lot of assumptions here, bear with me. It sounds like OP might have been doing the kin-keeping for her husband up to this point. Judging by the *objectively hilarious* gift and its reception by MIL, husband might need to take back the care and keeping of his side of the family because his (presumed) off hands approach is how we ended up here. OP sounds over it.", "You apparently, since you bothered to reply \ud83e\udd23", "Yep!

My family uses a nickname for me that my wife doesn't use, and I use a nickname for my sister that no one else uses, my wife has a nickname her mom uses that makes her skin crawl when I use it...  \n\nIt's not like Grandma is using a name that isn't even close to the full name of the kiddo, it's a diminutive of the original name.  All the comments about why the nickname bothers the OP are really just like... \"well, yeah you already know the problem, but what are you going to do if your kid chooses a nickname and it doesn't conform to your rules?  What do you do when he's fine with your MIL's nickname for him?\"", "I think it means everyone sucks here. It's used when both people are assholes.", "She could have used the name properly and there\u2019d be no need for the gag gift.", "I think this was a self-hit in order to build the story that OP humiliated her in front of *everyone*. So stupid.", "MIL was the one who humiliated herself by \u201ctelling everyone and extended family\u201d about the gift. No one would have known otherwise.", "She has already said it\u2019s not that difficult to pronounce and that she\u2019s said his full name when speaking to her father. The MIL is doing is out of pure spite. \n\nAlso, if I were you I wouldn\u2019t be openly admitting that I break the law and discriminate against ethnic or \u201cuniquely named\u201d people in my hiring practices.", "Well that's just fkd up. You should not be in a position of power if that's how you choose to do business. What you've just admitted to is conscious bias, racism, as it were. Because most of these names you don't know how to pronounce come from different cultures, you're consciously choosing people who fit your narrative better. \n\nYou really need to up your linguistic skills and stop being a racist asshole.", "I hope you get sued for discrimination.", "Am I missing some insane sarcasm in your comment, expert_life66? You literally won\u2019t hire people with names from other cultures?! Is this a joke?

Duh.", "This opens a whole other layer to the family dynamic", "But the disrespect was happening long before the gift.", "Uhh, look, I think you're using just a LITTLE too much logic here - how could he possibly be responsible for something that complex?? He's obviously a very busy man or he'd have told his mother to stop calling his son by an American girls name! \n\n\n/s, I'm over her laughing at how obvious your answer is and I love it", "This part tho", "Generally the phrase \u201cwho cares\u201d is used to denote the lack of significance of a particular event in the grand scheme of things. Hope this helps clarify. I know sometimes it\u2019s ESL on here!!", "The thing is MIL CAN say the same just fine. MIL uses to talk to OPs dad and could say his name then.\n\nThe kid is still way too little to have done anything to get a nick name.", "You're on Reddit. Most of these people don't know how the real world works. They truly believe a mother policing the nickname of her child is normal or fine behaviour. \n\nThe funny part to me is, in a few years or a decade when everyone calls him the same nickname, is she going to be buying phonic books for everyone? Turning up to the school to demand other students stop calling him a nickname?\n\nThis isn't normal behaviour and the possessiveness over something that ultimately isn't your business anymore is weird. (Because once a parent gives a name, it's no longer theirs to own.)", "Eh, I feel like that\u2019s a separate argument to have since the kid will be able to voice his own opinion then. If OP refuses to allow a nickname when her son is old enough to say that he likes it, then yeah she\u2019s an AH. But right now the kid is still learning his own name, so I get why OP wants to make sure everyone uses his real name.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think the special-personal-nickname exception applies here either since MIL is introducing her grandson to strangers by the nickname she chose, not by his real name. We have familial nicknames in my family too, but I don\u2019t introduce my cousin Christina to strangers as Chrissy. I introduce her by her legal name or as Christy (because that\u2019s the diminutive she goes by at school). I don\u2019t introduce her as Chrissy because that nickname is for _family_ to use\u2014not random people she\u2019s just met.", "Happy cake day!", "Yup.  She told on herself because she was hoping for sympathy.", "Exactly. I mean, I\u2019m all for honesty but do they think that being honest about something so vile will earn them points? We could all be honest about that one time that\u2026 (*insert shameful story here*) but most of us know, that most folks who applaud that kind of radical honesty are those who\u2019ve done just as bad or worse & wanna feel better about themselves.", "I do not break the law.  I hire all races, genders and ages.", "Do you know how to read?  The last three people I hired were Black, Hispanic and Asian.  Geez read it again.
