You did something nice for a kid. That\u2019s not an AH activity, is it?", "NTA. She wasn't some random kid, you knew and liked her from your volunteer days.  It was a sweet thing you did.  However I was the younger sister who never got to go along with the older brother, so I understand your sister's jealousy.  Perhaps tell your sister that you will take her along next time you run errands but explain to her that you aren't taking her out as a party, it's work. Even if she is an awful pain, she needs to feel loved and appreciated.", "NTA. She\u2019s a big girl and you were doing something generous", "Info; did your sister want to spend time with you or the did she want the gift and Starbucks. Because if it\u2019s just the gift and Starbucks, you can get her those without spending time with her (I saw your edits).", "NAH, You obviously had good intentions, and you did a nice thing. I wouldn't call you an asshole for not thinking of your sister at that moment, but I can see how it might upset her, and I think it's good that she communicated she's upset and would like to spend more time with you.", "This reminds me much of my childhood, except I was Ellie and my mom was the tutor going to other people's houses. And I was 14. Don't miss those tough times...", "Your sister is just being selfish. NTA.", "NTA. You had every right to spend the leftover money however you wanted to spend it, and it sounds like you did a good thing for a family who appreciated it, and doesn\u2019t get the same experience very often. \n\nWhile I can see how your sister might be bummed she didn\u2019t get Starbs, or a toy, she is NOT entitled to it, and she is not entitled to the money you had to spend. It\u2019s also somewhat disturbing she didn\u2019t ask you to ADD her a drink or a toy- she wanted it INSTEAD of the little girl. Taking things from others isn\u2019t kind. \n\nShe needs to learn she doesn\u2019t always get everything she wants. My mom taught my brother and I at a very young age: \u201csometimes you get something and your sibling doesn\u2019t, other times your sibling gets something that you don\u2019t get. Just be happy for them that they got something cool, and know you\u2019ll have your turn another time.\u201d\n\nThis might have been a secret cry for more time with you/attention from you- but it sounds mostly about the money and being greedy", "NTA\u2026. Your sis was ready to shoot  the shot and was upset you didn\u2019t spend the time on her instead. Maybe if you were both able to sit down and work on yourselves you might begin to have a bond, but with an aggression like that, as it it now, she could definitely grow a bit\u2026. Coming from someone who hated her older sister of 7 years until we both were way past puberty", "NTA.  Ellie wasn\u2019t a random kid.  You already knew her.  You did something nice for Ellie, and her and her mom appreciated it.  You can always hang out with your sister another time.", "NTA but maybe try to get along with your sister more. I used to hate my brother at that age but now I wish I had put in more effort to get along with him. Eventually you get older and don't see eachother as often and you miss them. \n\nSounds like your sister isn't angry about the money, seems she just wants to spend time with you and is jealous you did the things she wants to do with you with someone else.", "YTA, based on your responses.

But I understand your sister\u2019s hurt. My sister and I have the same age gap, but I\u2019m the younger sister. I spent most of my childhood trying to make her like me when it was pretty clear she was annoyed by me and didn\u2019t enjoy my company. It was always a huge kick in the teeth when she raved about her friend\u2019s younger siblings or took them out to do stuff, because it felt like evidence that it wasn\u2019t because I was younger, she just didn\u2019t like me personally, which is rough to feel about family. Especially from an older sibling who I looked up to so much. \n\nMy sister and I are close now, but I still remember that time of our lives and it wasn\u2019t easy.", "NTA. You did a very nice thing for that girl and hopefully your sister can learn something from it. Merry Christmas!", "My sister\u2019s upset that I invited Ellie and not her even though I know she has been feeling left out.", "Op is Older sister.\n\n The sister is being greedy, she wants the Starbucks gift card.", "It\u2019s difficult to spend time with her. She\u2019s incredibly stubborn and argues with everyone over everything", "He doesn't hate her, just didn't want to be around her. That's not than okay. Not all of our siblings do we enjoy being around. \n\nI had three younger siblings growing up (at 19, my mom had another kid and then another two years after that so now there's 6 of us), the youngest girl is 3 years younger than me and as much as I knew she was just a product of her circumstances, I still couldn't stand to be around her because she actively chose to not work on herself and be a productive member of society. She still won't get a job, won't go to school, any amount of help and support is met with trying to take more from everyone else without doing anything to make it better for herself. There's a lot to went into how she became the way she is but I have effectively gone NC with her because she wants to claim that she's doing one thing while literally sitting on her ass all day or sleeping.", "There are plenty of opportunities for you too to hang out. Tell her you\u2019ll spend time together too.", "Yes I know OP is older sister.  I should have said older sibling in my comment to head off nit-pickers.", "Yup, that's young teens for ya. You were probably the same way at her age whether you would admit it or not.  You can't expect a 14 year old to be emotionally mature, the least you could do is set a good example.\n\nIf the roles were reversed, your sister would probably say the same about you. You're still fairly young yourself and seem to be pulling the ol' \"I'm too cool for my younger sibling\" which is very common at your age. \n\nI can't tell you what to do but there will come a day when your sister grows up and matures like you have and you'll regret not putting up with her, I sure wish my brother would have anyways.", "This just comes across as a 14 year old girl wanting to spend time with or be included in the life of her older sister, being made to feel like she\u2019s too annoying to be around by said sister, and then feeling left out because her sister would rather hang out with a 9 year old that OP has no real relationship with.\n\nLittle siblings are annoying but if you\u2019re lucky, there\u2019s something grand waiting for you, once they get over a certain age. If you don\u2019t build a relationship with them, you squash your chances of that relationship down to 0. \n\nJust because YOUR sister is going through something in her life (I wish her well), doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay for OP to treat her kid sister insensitively.\n\nWe are given virtually no information about the younger sister except for that she\u2019s annoying\u2026which is not good enough.", "The op is female.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t want to hang out with her", "I get 14 year olds are difficult but she\u2019s something else. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, you just have to be here. All you have to know is personalities clash and I don\u2019t enjoy spending time with her.", "Having 5 bio siblings and numerous others, I absolutely agree that there is something amazing that can happen with sibling relationships past a certain age. The other part of that is that both siblings need to put in effort. \n\nI wish both my sisters well and I hope they find ways to get back to being healthy individuals. \n\nI'm not saying it is okay to be treat her insensitively, but there's different levels of  wanting to do things with others. They're allowed to choose who to spend they free time with. They wanted to do something out of there way to help the Ellie and their mom. The teenage sister is whining she didn't get the $10 for Walmart and a Starbucks. Not that they didn't get to go spend time together. If the sister was specifically comparing about having time with OP, I could say be more open to discussing boundaries about how to go out and what to do but she's whinging because she didn't get the thing the Ellie got (money for a toy and a drink).", "Then don\u2019t", "Why don\u2019t you want to hang out with your sister?", "Is that something you've been able to talk to her about? Maybe ask in /r/relationship_advice about how to do it tactfully?\n\nShe's getting old enough she can change her behavior and it's worth giving her a chance if you haven't. \n\nBut if you've tried and she digs her heels in on the behavior that bothers you- well that's her choice not your problem.", "I get that but it really sounds like your sister wants to spend time with you and as the older one of the two, you could probably buck up and try to spend some alone time with her and make her feel involved. If not you, then at least she'll be happy to spend time with you, and sooner or later you'll realize that someone wanting to spend time with you is a rare commodity. \n\nEventually in your life you'll be left with very few people around you who genuinely want to spend time with you. Adults are bitter and too busy all the time and it gets hard to make true, genuine friends. You could show some maturity and try to put up with your younger sibling who is going through an emotionally complex time in her upbringing for the benefit of a lifelong best friend.", "You\u2019re choosing to assume that the younger sister is in it for Starbucks and $10, even though OP literally wrote that her sister has expressed sentiments of feeling left out\u2026 \n\nBut choose the fun, toxic narrative where we can shit on a child without any solid information. I don\u2019t blame you.", "They probably don\u2019t get along.", "I agree, Wasting a perfectly good sibling relationship just because one is an annoying teenager is unwise and sad. \n\nAs long as no one getting hurt, of course.", "I didn't specifically see the line where it said she felt left out, just if she can handle then with a nine year old, she could handle them with her.  \n\nWith that in mind, I think op should have a conversation with their sister about things they're willing to do to spend time together. Again, as the oldest sibling, it's fucking exhausting but if you want to show what a good relationship and communication looks like, this should be the start of it.", "So then idk\u2026read the entire post before commenting? \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be rude but I mean, why?\n\nOP said she\u2019s not interested in hanging out in the comments somewhere. OP is TA.", "I did read the entire post. You know that thing about eyes moving faster than brain? It happens a lot to me. If I miss something and it doesn't make sense, I'll go back and reread but it made sense the way my brain saw it.", "Fair enough lol", "Info: How often does your sister ask to do things with you, and how often to you actual agree to spend time with her? \n\nSome people are calling your sister greedy, and I *might* agree with them if she only complained about your outing AFTER learning about the Walmart card and the Starbucks. **BUT**\u2026.\n\nIf she frequently asks you to include her/do things with her and you never or almost never do, how do you think this makes her feel? She wants to spend time with you and you ignore her, but you\u2019ve got enough time/compassion for someone who is barely an acquaintance? You\u2019ve just shown her how truly little she matters to you.", "Yeah, I bet if you invited your sister to run errrands with you, she would have told you to eff off.  You didn\u2019t take the girl for gift cards and Starbucks.  You shared with her after she kept you company.  Your sister needs a reality check.", "But you may want a relationship in the future. My older sister and I fell out when we were teens but now we\u2019re in our 30\u2019s and friends have come and gone and we\u2019ve got this five year plan to one day live near each other and raise our kids together. Don\u2019t burn that bridge too soon, you may regret it.", "It's fine if you don't want to have a relationship with your sister. Just be aware that the choices you make now will impact the future, and if you change your mind 5-10 years later, she might not be there waiting for you. And you won't get to be mad about it.\n\nNTA for doing something nice for a kid in hard times, though."]}
