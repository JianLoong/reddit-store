You had every right to let her out. Only thing I'd say is that maybe you could've sent a text or something to make sure she got home safe.

If this was a woman driving and a man being handsy, there would be an outrage.  \n\nBut even in that situation, putting someone out of the car when they are inebriated is dangerous for them.  Tell her to phone a friend or something for the few blocks to her house.  Tell her to get in the back seat if she can't behave in the front.   \n\nAt the very least, you let her out of the car and follow to make sure she gets home.  Or call the non-emergency number to tell them a friend is drunk and insisted on getting out of your vehicle and you'd like them to do a well-check to make sure she arrived home.", "[deleted]", "I get why you did it and that you were uncomfortable, but still Y T A. The reason I say this is several years ago some friends came and knocked on my door late at night, asking me to call 911. They found a girl when they were walking. She'd been beaten up and her panties were ripped off and thrown to the side. She was knocked out cold. We called 911 and went to wait for the ambulance to make sure she was safe, one friend was already there keeping an eye on her. Later, when she had recovered, we found out she had been drinking and had a fight with her boyfriend that night and he had pulled over and told her to get out and walk. She was beaten and raped. This is not okay. You could have pulled over, gotten out, called her an uber, and waited there, outside of the car, until you knew she was safe, or something, anything beside just making a drunk girl, whose judgement was clearly skewed at the time, walk by herself. Yes, she was wrong to behave that way, but you still had a responsibility to make sure she was safe. On the other hand, good on you for not taking advantage of her, but next time, please do better.  \n\n\nEdited to change my vote to ESH, because she does suck for not respecting your boundaries and it is a tough situation, but I would never leave a drunk friend to walk alone. I would at least follow them in my car.", "Well I guess I'm about to be downvoted to hell. Lol. She behaved so inappropriately. It was unacceptable. At the same time leaving a drunk girl alone at night to stumble home for a few blocks is how people get abducted/raped/killed. ESH.", "Going with ESH. Her behavior was out of line and a danger to your driving, so you were right to tell her to stop. But letting her walk home intoxicated without checking to make sure she actually gets in the door, is not a good move. And you're supposed to be friends with her?", "YTA.  You should have stopped the car and refused to move until she behaved herself.  You could have slapped her hands away from the steering wheel.  Talking wasn't working so only action can.  You wimped out and abandoned her on the side of the road.  Women are abducted everyday from places deemed safe by others.", "Look, I get your safety concerns. When I was in high school there was a girl the grade above me who was killed in a car accident because someone who was drunk grabbed the steering wheel and yanked it.

If the genders were swapped there would be completely different scenario/risks because a drunk man is a lot less likely to be assaulted walking home than a drunk woman. The two scenarios are not comparable. \n\nI agree with you that OP is NTA though. The gender is irrelevant because she was trying to assault OP, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether walking home would be a danger to her because OP\u2019s safety takes priority.\n\nEdit: Since people are being pedantic in the comments, \u201cnot comparable\u201d in this context means \u201cshould not be treated the same\u201d. The risk of the female passenger being assaulted if they\u2019re left to wander home while drunk is not the same risk as a male passenger being assaulted.\n\nIn this scenario that risk is irrelevant as that person is putting OP in danger.", "I'd agree, and those are some good suggestions, but OP was a designated driver which means just that.

It is a danger to leave her on the side of the road like that but she really gave you almost no choice and at least she was only a few blocks away.

You politely declined her advances and asked her to stop, more than once. I agree that if she had stayed in the car, it could have been even more dangerous. \nI realize that leaving a drunk woman to walk home is not the safest thing to do...I probably would have parked and walked with her BUT she was all touchy feely with you and so why would you want to even do that much? I totally get it. When people are that intoxicated, you never know when an annoying flirty mood could abruptly change to a violent toxic kind of mood. It was just safer for you to let her walk home. She did make it home, thankfully. You're not responsible for a grown woman that isn't even really close to you. Her actions were inappropriate and you reacted accordingly. If she had realized that \"no\" and \"stop\" should not have to be said more than once, and she left you alone, you would have driven her the rest of the way.

If a man did this, can you imagine the reaction he would get ??!?!\nAnd that's not even taking into account the fact she was actively trying to make you crash by grabbing at your hands that were on the wheel of a moving vehicle. \nNever be near her again , she is DANGEROUS.", "NTA but you were wrong. When you agree to DD you are agreeing to get these drunks home. You failed. You could have kicked her out and followed her home. You could have called for help - friend, family, police. Being arrested for public intoxication is far better than dead, raped, hit by car\u2026. \n\nI have DD\u2019d my entire life because I don\u2019t drink (family alcohol issues).

And you were correct not to stand for it. \n\nBUT leaving someone who's in that condition alone by the side of the road... not good. And I know she's not your friend, and and I know you were doing it as a favor, but when you accepted to drive her home, you took it on as a responsibility. \n\nThere are other solutions. Like making her get into the back of the car, having her call herself an Uber and waiting with her for it. Even following her as she walked home to make sure she made it. But dumping someone on the side of the road just isn't good.", "Maybe you could have hung back and made sure she made it  in her house.", "NTA \n\nExpect her to spin this to mutual friends though. If people start being wierd toward you, ask them why and I bet you'll find that she tells a very different story. It's up to you if you tell mutual friends what happened to get ahead of rumors. You know your friends best. \n\nSeems like it was a blow to her ego that you said no. Too bad, so sad, definitely her problem. No reason for you to continue to put up with that uncomfortable and unsafe situation.", "NTA but since she was drunk you probably should have secretly stuck around to verify she made it home and didn\u2019t pass out on the side of the road.", "NTA.

Those are the options.", "She can't have it both ways.\n\nShe refused to let you drive safely.  She said she would walk home when you asked her to stop distracting you from driving.

Cops were able to reconstruct what happened, and her parents ended up fending off a lawsuit from the guy's parents over his wrongful death.

I don't care\n\n2 - endangerment of myself, other passengers, other road users and general public - the only controls you can touch as a drunk passenger are the radio, window controls, and climate control...you touch the wheel, gearstick, horn, wipers, light controls, indicators etc get the fuck out \n\nSo unless someone has a load of very minor infractions that get you kicked out I'd really assume the worst if I heard a designated driver kicked someone out tbh", "I don't feel its dismissing the experiences of an entire gender.
