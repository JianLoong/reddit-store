You had every right to let her out. Only thing I'd say is that maybe you could've sent a text or something to make sure she got home safe.

If this was a woman driving and a man being handsy, there would be an outrage.  \n\nBut even in that situation, putting someone out of the car when they are inebriated is dangerous for them.  Tell her to phone a friend or something for the few blocks to her house.  Tell her to get in the back seat if she can't behave in the front.   \n\nAt the very least, you let her out of the car and follow to make sure she gets home.  Or call the non-emergency number to tell them a friend is drunk and insisted on getting out of your vehicle and you'd like them to do a well-check to make sure she arrived home.", "[deleted]", "I get why you did it and that you were uncomfortable, but still Y T A. The reason I say this is several years ago some friends came and knocked on my door late at night, asking me to call 911. They found a girl when they were walking. She'd been beaten up and her panties were ripped off and thrown to the side. She was knocked out cold. We called 911 and went to wait for the ambulance to make sure she was safe, one friend was already there keeping an eye on her. Later, when she had recovered, we found out she had been drinking and had a fight with her boyfriend that night and he had pulled over and told her to get out and walk. She was beaten and raped. This is not okay. You could have pulled over, gotten out, called her an uber, and waited there, outside of the car, until you knew she was safe, or something, anything beside just making a drunk girl, whose judgement was clearly skewed at the time, walk by herself. Yes, she was wrong to behave that way, but you still had a responsibility to make sure she was safe. On the other hand, good on you for not taking advantage of her, but next time, please do better.  \n\n\nEdited to change my vote to ESH, because she does suck for not respecting your boundaries and it is a tough situation, but I would never leave a drunk friend to walk alone. I would at least follow them in my car.", "Well I guess I'm about to be downvoted to hell. Lol. She behaved so inappropriately. It was unacceptable. At the same time leaving a drunk girl alone at night to stumble home for a few blocks is how people get abducted/raped/killed. ESH.", "Going with ESH. Her behavior was out of line and a danger to your driving, so you were right to tell her to stop. But letting her walk home intoxicated without checking to make sure she actually gets in the door, is not a good move. And you're supposed to be friends with her?", "YTA.  You should have stopped the car and refused to move until she behaved herself.  You could have slapped her hands away from the steering wheel.  Talking wasn't working so only action can.  You wimped out and abandoned her on the side of the road.  Women are abducted everyday from places deemed safe by others.", "Look, I get your safety concerns. When I was in high school there was a girl the grade above me who was killed in a car accident because someone who was drunk grabbed the steering wheel and yanked it.

If the genders were swapped there would be completely different scenario/risks because a drunk man is a lot less likely to be assaulted walking home than a drunk woman. The two scenarios are not comparable. \n\nI agree with you that OP is NTA though. The gender is irrelevant because she was trying to assault OP, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether walking home would be a danger to her because OP\u2019s safety takes priority.\n\nEdit: Since people are being pedantic in the comments, \u201cnot comparable\u201d in this context means \u201cshould not be treated the same\u201d. The risk of the female passenger being assaulted if they\u2019re left to wander home while drunk is not the same risk as a male passenger being assaulted.\n\nIn this scenario that risk is irrelevant as that person is putting OP in danger.", "I'd agree, and those are some good suggestions, but OP was a designated driver which means just that.

It is a danger to leave her on the side of the road like that but she really gave you almost no choice and at least she was only a few blocks away.

You politely declined her advances and asked her to stop, more than once. I agree that if she had stayed in the car, it could have been even more dangerous. \nI realize that leaving a drunk woman to walk home is not the safest thing to do...I probably would have parked and walked with her BUT she was all touchy feely with you and so why would you want to even do that much? I totally get it. When people are that intoxicated, you never know when an annoying flirty mood could abruptly change to a violent toxic kind of mood. It was just safer for you to let her walk home. She did make it home, thankfully. You're not responsible for a grown woman that isn't even really close to you. Her actions were inappropriate and you reacted accordingly. If she had realized that \"no\" and \"stop\" should not have to be said more than once, and she left you alone, you would have driven her the rest of the way.

When you agree to DD you are agreeing to get these drunks home. You failed. You could have kicked her out and followed her home. You could have called for help - friend, family, police.

And you were correct not to stand for it. \n\nBUT leaving someone who's in that condition alone by the side of the road... not good. And I know she's not your friend, and and I know you were doing it as a favor, but when you accepted to drive her home, you took it on as a responsibility. \n\nThere are other solutions. Like making her get into the back of the car, having her call herself an Uber and waiting with her for it. Even following her as she walked home to make sure she made it.

But thankfully we have the ability to apply context to situations to better judge them. \nGiven the context this isn\u2019t an assault. Not even close. \nI wouldn\u2019t want to be this girls friend or hang out with her. She acted like an ass and rather then face up to it the next morning when she was sober she continued acting the ass. She is not likable and sounds like she has some issues but she is not guilty of assault or sexual harassment. She\u2019s guilty of being a drunk and a sober ahole. \nHer inebriation has a lot to do with it; legally it can be both an aggravating or a mitigating factor in both charging or sentencing phase, because it adds context to the situation.", "Not only was she a risk to him (because she could have caused an accident), but she explicitly said \"I'll just walk if you won't let me sexually assault you\"", "Men are more likely to be victims of violent crime in the US. Sexual assault is not the only possibility when walking alone at night. \n\nIn this case, the person who chose to assault a person put herself in danger.", ">I dare you to look into the eyes of a mother whose daughter has been raped and tell her, Well she was drunk and getting awful and disrespectful and handsy to the man driving her home so what could he do? \n\nI gave you the slight benefit of the doubt in your first response\n\nBut...the actual stance you've taken that HYPOTHETICAL female victim hood comes WAAAY above ACTUAL male victim hood is actually fucking gross.\n\nDo better.\n\n>eyes of a mother whose daughter has been raped and tell her, Well she was drunk and getting awful and disrespectful and handsy to the man driving her home so what could he do? \n\nWhat is rape? I'm not being disingenuous...\n\nIt is the end result of continuous violations of consent\n\nYou cannot hold the stance that sexual assault is merely \"handsy\" and \"disrespectful\" and also pretend to be super anti rape. Consent is consent Is consent - to sit and pretend that certain groups consent matters more, or that violations of that consent are less egregious when done by certain groups is to enable the most vile groups of society in their violations of consent.", "The contempt is for sexual harassers. If they also happen to be other things that's incidental\n\nAlso telling someone's mother that is not the thing to do for other reasons. \n\nNamely, regardless of the circumstances said imaginary victim was in and her responsibility for them, someone doing bad things to her isn't her fault. And hopefully the mother would have enough grace to blame the right person, the perpetrator, not someone her daughter was victimizing", "The indifference you have to the ACTUAL victim of sexual harassment here is insane. I can't fathom to stupidity it takes to write a comment like that. Truly mind boggling.", "> The indifference, in fact the contempt, being shown to the victims of abduction, rape, and murder is heart breaking.\n\nYou did the exact thing. Look into the eyes of a mother with a son and tell her that you want her son to let a woman keep sexually abusing him and take care of her while he is being sexually abused by her in a closed vehicle.\n\nYou are a sickening person. People like you give feminism a bad name.", "In the real world, **the majority of people are fucking appalled by sexual assault**.\n\nIf you believe otherwise, you are either terminally stupid or just unwilling to accept reality because it contradicts your false victim narrative that \"tHe WoRlD hAtEs WyMyN!!!!!!\"", "Trans men are men, so yes.", "the majority of violent crimes committed by men are on strangers whereas ones committed by women are people that they know which is on that wikipedia page, not sure about sex crimes, but yeah it\u2019s not specific to that particular situation because it wasn\u2019t supposed to be. \n\ni used those stats because the og commenter said \u2018assault\u2019 specifically conflating it with \u2018sexual assault\u2019 which i believe to be dangerous as it\u2019s often used by \u2018men\u2019s rights activist\u2019 to undermine feminism.", "Considering the amount of women that I know personally that have been victim blamed by multiple in their life, including cops, I'm going to go ahead and say that your statement is not necessarily true. \nEveryone's appalled bisexual assault until someone they know is accused of it. Then all of a sudden it's they wouldn't do that, I know them, they're not like that. Just because people say online that they're appalled by, doesn't mean that they were actually hold someone that they know accountable for it even with proof.

And it's like...Well yeah hypothetically if a guy punched me and HYPOTHETICALLY this led to a chain of events where he was kidnapped castrated and enslaved by ISIS...but can we focus on reality?), and even ADVOCACY for the abuser - she sexually assaulted you but you should've just accepted it till you got her home, or rang her a taxi, or pursued in car from follow distance to make sure she got home safe...is actually sickening and I don't like the fact that men don't report female sexual predators...but I fully understand WHY they don't - between the complete denial, victim blaming etc I certainly wouldn't...just seems like pouring salt on the wound", "are you willing to source those studies?\n\nthere is definitely an underreporting of sexual abuse perpetrated against men and then not understanding they\u2019ve been abused, but this also applies to women, so the true rates are higher for both. \n\nthe rates at which men and women are sexually abused and are abusers are definitely not \u2018closely equal\u2019 from the all the studies i\u2019ve seen. \n\ndo u know gary glitter? /s"]}
