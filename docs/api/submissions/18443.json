There were 2 other friends who had been in the car with us, but I as the designated driver had already dropped them off. Obviously coming from the bar, she was wasted and sitting in the front seat. I\u2019ve never been close with her, but friendly enough to take her home. It was about a 25 minute drive, but it was only two of us for 5-ish. Once I had dropped off the other friends, her mood changed completely. She instantly became flirtatious, getting a little too close for my comfort. I told her to give my space while driving, because duh, but she wouldn\u2019t quit it. She then continued to grab at my hands, WHILE they were on the wheel. This was obviously dangerous, the road we were about to leave was still quite busy. She did not stop. I pulled over for a moment for safety reasons, and she started to get even more rambunctious. This is not a woman I am comfortable with- I was only taking her home for the courtesy. She became very loud and upset when I told her to stop distracting my driving, and said she would just walk home if I was going to act \u201clike a dick\u201d for the rest of the drive (keep in mind, it was 5 minutes max- I was about to turn into her neighborhood complex.) I shrugged, and unlocked the door for her. She got out, and I drove away. The next morning, I woke up to at LEAST 20 missed calls from her, and a super long paragraph about how upset she was with me because I left her in a dangerous situation. Imo, the situation would have been dangerous either way. She was only a few blocks away from home.

You had every right to let her out. Only thing I'd say is that maybe you could've sent a text or something to make sure she got home safe. I know I'd personally feel guilty for just leaving someone drunk since I'm in the medical field and have seen the many ways it can go wrong, even if they're close to home. But you really didn't owe her anything, so no, NTA.\n\nedit: spelling", "I feel the best judgement for this is ESH.    \n\nI understand stopping the car and definitely understand not wanting to be in the car with a woman endangering your driving and being handsy.  If this was a woman driving and a man being handsy, there would be an outrage.  \n\nBut even in that situation, putting someone out of the car when they are inebriated is dangerous for them.  Tell her to phone a friend or something for the few blocks to her house.  Tell her to get in the back seat if she can't behave in the front.   \n\nAt the very least, you let her out of the car and follow to make sure she gets home.  Or call the non-emergency number to tell them a friend is drunk and insisted on getting out of your vehicle and you'd like them to do a well-check to make sure she arrived home.", "ESH\n\nOverwhelmingly and primarily, she sucks for putting you in that position in the first place, when you were trying to do a nice thing. \n\nBut you suck a little bit for leaving a person alone in the middle of the night on the side of the road. I don\u2019t know if I could handle it on my conscious if I left someone like that and something bad happened, even if they were being a jerk to me immediately prior.", "I get why you did it and that you were uncomfortable, but still Y T A. The reason I say this is several years ago some friends came and knocked on my door late at night, asking me to call 911. They found a girl when they were walking. She'd been beaten up and her panties were ripped off and thrown to the side. She was knocked out cold. We called 911 and went to wait for the ambulance to make sure she was safe, one friend was already there keeping an eye on her. Later, when she had recovered, we found out she had been drinking and had a fight with her boyfriend that night and he had pulled over and told her to get out and walk. She was beaten and raped. This is not okay. You could have pulled over, gotten out, called her an uber, and waited there, outside of the car, until you knew she was safe, or something, anything beside just making a drunk girl, whose judgement was clearly skewed at the time, walk by herself. Yes, she was wrong to behave that way, but you still had a responsibility to make sure she was safe. On the other hand, good on you for not taking advantage of her, but next time, please do better.  \n\n\nEdited to change my vote to ESH, because she does suck for not respecting your boundaries and it is a tough situation, but I would never leave a drunk friend to walk alone. I would at least follow them in my car.", "Well I guess I'm about to be downvoted to hell. Lol. She behaved so inappropriately. It was unacceptable. At the same time leaving a drunk girl alone at night to stumble home for a few blocks is how people get abducted/raped/killed. ESH.", "Going with ESH. Her behavior was out of line and a danger to your driving, so you were right to tell her to stop. But letting her walk home intoxicated without checking to make sure she actually gets in the door, is not a good move. And you're supposed to be friends with her?", "YTA.  You should have stopped the car and refused to move until she behaved herself.  You could have slapped her hands away from the steering wheel.  Talking wasn't working so only action can.  You wimped out and abandoned her on the side of the road.  Women are abducted everyday from places deemed safe by others.", "Look, I get your safety concerns. When I was in high school there was a girl the grade above me who was killed in a car accident because someone who was drunk grabbed the steering wheel and yanked it. But, there has to be a better way than to leave a drunk woman on the side of the road late at night. Even if you followed her from a distance to make sure she got home safely. YTA", "Yeah I think it's assault bc she was touching him. I'm not sure, harassment is talking, messages non physical stuff, but touching I believe is considered assault", "I feel personally attacked...I do ma best cooking when I'm drunk \ud83e\udd2a", "I really hate it when people say \u201cif the genders were swapped\u201d. If the genders were swapped there would be completely different scenario/risks because a drunk man is a lot less likely to be assaulted walking home than a drunk woman. The two scenarios are not comparable. \n\nI agree with you that OP is NTA though. The gender is irrelevant because she was trying to assault OP, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether walking home would be a danger to her because OP\u2019s safety takes priority.", "I'd agree, and those are some good suggestions, but OP was a designated driver which means just that. Doesn't include servant, caretaker, romantic escort and guardian angel.\n\nPeople who get drunk out of their minds because they expect someone to nanny them are absolute AHs. Nothing happened, but the \"friend\" has the audacity to text him calling him the AH when she could have gotten them both killed, and used her drunkenness as an excuse to touch him inappropriately.\n\nNTA", "I couldn\u2019t agree with you more!", "I think Someone essentially sa-ing the driver waived all rights to be escorted home and can get themselves home.\n\nNo one would bat an eye if he dropped a guy off for doing the same but because it\u2018s a woman everyone is on his case.\n\nClear NTA for me", "Yes.  He is getting harrassed probably assaulted , but he should just suck it up so some random drunk idiot doesn't.  Brilliant logic.", "Just hit a woman, what could go wrong? Are you insane? She should stop harrasing men if she wants a drive. NTA", "[deleted]", "And you are absolutely allowed to have that opinion. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "I didn't say he should just suck it up. I said he should do something to make sure she was safe. He doesn't have to keep her in his car. He doesn't have to keep driving her. He can put her out of his car and follow her while she walks. He can call an uber for her. He can call the cops for all I care and have them take her home, but he should not just abandon her.", "Slapping her hands away from the steering wheel is not the same as your emotional expansion of what was said.  Get real.  She had her hands on the wheel.  Who wouldn't slap the hands away?", "> No\n\nWhat are you disagreeing with?\n\n> She doesn\u2019t get to use her safety as a weapon to sexually assault men \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I said. No one of any gender gets to use their safety as an excuse to sexually assault someone else.", "Sorry not sure why it deleted. The way you phrased the last sentence sounded like you were saying her right to safe passage trumps her being held responsible for her behaviour, if that makes sense.\n\nThank you for explaining what you meant."]}
