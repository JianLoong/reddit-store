And are we going to ask your parents to babysit? Or put him into daycare. This was the dreaded situation between my wife and I. \n\nBefore we decided to have kids, we moved out into our own house shortly after we got married. (coming from an apartment we were both living in) We took everything into consideration: community, area, school district, but most importantly... location. Not just distance to work or local shopping areas, but more importantly the distance to my wife's parents. As we knew later on, we would have them babysit as they were the closest grandparents. My parents live 3-4 hours away, which was not really ideal for daily babysitting.\n\nMy MIL (67) was soon to retire the same year we were expecting, so it all worked out anyways, or so we thought. This was the kicker. Her dad (63)... I know growing up, my wife always talked about how he liked to have financial responsibility and security. So he was very financial savvy with her. But he never really shared how much he makes or made, or how much he has. He never liked the idea of \"free handouts\", but he would help her in her financial needs. Like paying part of her college tuition, buying her a car as long as she takes care of insurance, gas, etc., Which is a good mindset to which we agree with. He has spoken to me about his retirement funds (somewhere in the couple millions range), and how much he makes (somewhere in the $150k/yr range) so I know he doesn't need money. My wife knows he doesn't need money but doesn't know how much he has.\n\nWhenever we talked to them about babysitting, they loved the idea. Since her mom would be retiring it would work out perfectly. And they'd get to see their grandchild every day or most days. Soon after we had our baby, maternity/paternity leave was up. I was going back to work, my wife had another month left, and her dad started talking about paying them for babysitting. Seeing as he wasn't fond of the free babysitting, he started to compare pricing of daycares in today's market and how much he would start charging us weekly. After his research, he surmised his amount to $400/wk for babysitting and $100 for weekends and we were shocked. We thought to ourselves, at that rate we might as well just take our baby to a daycare, and not have to drive back and forth. We weren't upset with having to pay them because we wanted to pay them, and we knew we weren't going to take advantage of the situation. We only started to get upset when he started demanding that we pay them for babysitting. And it's not like my wife and I were well off either, we make enough to live comfortably.  So it became a huge discussion between us to the point where we almost decided that they weren't going to see their grandchild unless we decide to see them on the weekends. \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to pay my in-laws for babysitting? \n\nEdit: A lot of posts are saying \"reeking of entitlement\" but take my sentences out of context. \n\nWe weren't expecting them to babysit for free. MIL was already set to retire soon. But retired \"early\" so she could be with her first grandchild and she loved the idea of being a \"FT carer\". Everything would be provided. EVERYTHING... \n\nAnd I guess to clarify the upset situation and using our child as blackmail. If you actually read the paragraph. I say we were wanting to pay them for the \"FT care\" but weren't expecting FIL to be a bit absurd with the cost to pay them. And the fact that he was demanding us to pay him when we were already going to pay them. \n\nI stated in that last sentence that they wouldn't see their grandchild unless we visit them on the weekends when we have time. It doesn't negate the fact that they can come visit anytime? Which is what everyone or mostly everyone is assuming. It wasn't said in a way that we would bar the grandparents from seeing the grandchild.", "created_utc": 1688902554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14uwdpt/aita_not_wanting_to_pay_grandparents_for/", "score": 3903, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Living near them with the expectation they\u2019ll be unpaid full-time carers for your children is quite another.", "I changed my mind from E S H to YTA. \n\nYou admit you assumed they wanted to babysit (and full-time, at that). \n\nIt sounds like you moved closer for their \u201cbabysitting services\u201d without having actually included them in any actual discussion, and just made assumption after assumption. What if they had decided to move? What was your plan then? \n\nYou only started working on a coordinated plan with them ONE MONTH before your wife\u2019s maternity leave was set to end. (Yikes!) \n\nThey kinda suck to charge you $400 a week, but you can take it or leave it. They are clearly trying to send a message that they\u2019re not a dumping ground for little one and are setting their boundaries now that you are not welcome to take advantage of them. Who knows- maybe they plan to charge you and put that money into a fund for babys college or something. \n\nAnd FINALLY YTA because of overall high assumptions and non-existent communication in general. You sound like you just plan to use them and that\u2019s crap. Welcome to parenting- it\u2019s filled with real accountability.

But not for the reason you think.  You are focused on money, ignoring that the more precious resource is time.  When you have been parents for 20 years, you will understand this better.  Grandchildren are better than children.  Why?  BECAUSE THEY GO HOME.  Your in-laws have done the whole married with children thing, the young'ns are all launched.   They have the house to themselves again.  And I'm sure they are enjoying it.  Oh, but wait.  Kiddo wants to pawn off HER kiddo on us and take us back to our hectic parenting days again?????   OH HECK NO.\n\nYou say they were excited about baby-sitting.  But I suspect that excitement was before they realized it would be a full-time job.  Now they are trying to find a graceful way to back out or limit it.  Thus, the $400 a week  is not about money.  It is encouraging you to find a different su....\n\nerrrrrrr, arrangement.\n\nThis should go without saying but you are also YTA for assuming grandparents would volunteer for daycare duty (paid or otherwise) just because they are the grandparents.", "YTA.  I don't know why you expected them to do it for whatever piddly amount you were \"planning\" on paying.  $400 a week for newborn care is a bargain where I am.", "You were an ahole when you wanted to get rid of your wife's cat, and you're an ahole now. 4 months ago you were in a financial tightspot - what's changed since then? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey don't owe you anything\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "YTA.

You chose to get married and chose to have the baby. Now you get to take responsibility for those choices, not pawn it off on someone else. Taking care of a baby full-time is hard work that *they* didn\u2019t choose - you did.", "YTA , you are expecting free child care not babysitting. Babysitting is like a date night thing, you want a childcare provider. \n\nI have noticed something with you, it is always all it nothing with you. You need to decide if you want a stranger, or a facility watching your child.  Or grandparents for close to the same price.", "YTA.  You're asking them to work full-time for free.  In fact, you **expected** them to work full-time for free. I've seen the toll free baby-sitting has taken on my retired sister. The least you can do is give them some money. But, if you think you can get daycare for that kind of money, do it. \n\nIn fact, it's actually a better solution. Think about it.  If your parents are the primary care, and they want to go on vacation or get sick, what's your back up plan? A stranger? Eat up your vacation?  BUT, if your child is in a daycare and the daycare need to close for any reason, your parents (if you ask nicely and beforehand) can be that back-up.  No strangers.", "Yta So these aren\u2019t random date nights out, or holidays you have to work, or post op sick days? You\u2019re implying daily babysitting while your family goes back to work? \n\nThat\u2019s insane. These are retirees.

Protect your relationship with them because this isn\u2019t going to shake out well otherwise.", "> we almost decided that they weren't going to see their grandchild\n\nUsing your kids as a bargaining chip and emotional blackmail makes **YTA** even before all the rest.\n\nPlease consider what you're asking of them. All day, every weekday and even some weekends. Your MIL is almost 70, everything you do to look after a baby/toddler is going to be much harder on her and exhaust her that much more. \n\nIt's a full time, exhausting job and a much bigger ask than what most of us ask of grandparents. \n\nSee it as a gesture of respect for the very hard work your asking of them/her.\n\nAnd unless your daycare pays below the *average minimum wage, you won't find it cheaper.", "YTA.  You had entitled expectations. In-laws have retirement expectations.

One on one full time care.  That's going to run close to double the rate they are giving you.  \n\nThose are their terms.  They can set them how they choose.  Either accept the terms or don't.  \n\nWe don't set people's pay rate for jobs based on how much money is in their retirement accounts.  They get paid market value.  In this case you are getting quite the discount.  \n\nBut the big issue here is you have fundamentally changed their role from fun grandparent who babysits from time to time and spoils the kid to a primary caretaker who is in charge of discipline and schedule keeping and education - all a very different dynamic.  This set up will fundamentally change everyone's relationship.  \n\nCarefully consider if this is worth it going forward.", "YTA. While that may seem a little expensive for a family member, it sounds like you were planning on taking advantage of them and then found out you can\u2019t and are now pissed. Even if your mil is retired, that doesn\u2019t mean her time is worthless. You decided to have a baby, you pay for said baby to get good care. They would probably give the baby more attention and trustworthy care than any other sitter, but if would rather then just pay for the childcare like any responsible parent would instead. Also, keep in mind one on one care is usually more expensive than a daycare.", "I think they were excited when they thought it would be once a week for date night and never considered that you wanted them to take on the whole of the childcare responsibilities.

You just expected they would do it for free?  News flash dude, their time is more precious to them than yours is to you, because they have significantly less of it left.

Stop being so fucking entitled.\n\n The fact that there's so many N T A votes that aren't down voted to oblivion really shows reddit's entitlement too.

However, what FIL has in his retirement is irrelevant, sounds like he is working to get to the recommended retirement savings for his income so live without significant change I. Life style. Your MIL is potentially giving up over 40+ hours of her free time for years this is not an insignificant sacrifice. And finally it cost money to watch children.  Baby proofing. Food. Toys. Potentially Baby and me classes if she wants to do something with them. Are you considering these things.", "Yta  Expecting free childcare is ridiculous, even from grandparents. You aren't talking an occasional errand, you're talking full time child care. They should have made it clear from the beginning that they wanted to be paid tho. Personally it's hilarious you would choose paying a stranger who is taking care of your baby and a few others vs one on one attention from two grandparents. But if you'd rather let a stranger take care of them to prove your point have at it.\nEdit:  changed verdict after seeing you were going to use your child as a pawn to extort free babysitting or be cut off. Wow.", "YTA. Of course you should pay her for child care. She may love that baby to bits, but it's still a lot of work to take care for a baby all day. Since she is presumably the one who will actually be caring for the baby, you should negotiate the price with her. Maybe you shouldn't have to pay what a daycare would charge, but you shouldn't expect to get it for free either.", "NAH.

I was a nanny for one kid and that was what i was paid. TBH if you both work 8hr schedule 9-5 let's say that's going to be over 40 hrs a week factoring in travel time for pickup that your parents have the baby. That's a full time Job. Even though your MIL is retired she's now going right back to work. That's a lot of time for her to give up for free and babies require a lot of care, diapers, wipes, feeding, naps, extra clothes, shell need a safe sleep space in her house for baby, a swing, a bouncer, bottles etc. it's going to cost money to prepare the space for a baby. She will have to sacrifice and plan her needs around this new responsibility now.

As a parent of 3 though, if i had the option of using family over daycare i would go with the individuals i trusted more with my child's care. \n\nYTA for saying they wouldn't get to see the grandchild unless you decide to go on a weekend.

Who is going to babysit our new baby? And are we going to ask your parents to babysit? Or put him into daycare. This was the dreaded situation between my wife and I. \n\nBefore we decided to have kids, we moved out into our own house shortly after we got married. (coming from an apartment we were both living in) We took everything into consideration: community, area, school district, but most importantly... location. Not just distance to work or local shopping areas, but more importantly the distance to my wife's parents. As we knew later on, we would have them babysit as they were the closest grandparents. My parents live 3-4 hours away, which was not really ideal for daily babysitting.\n\nMy MIL (67) was soon to retire the same year we were expecting, so it all worked out anyways, or so we thought. This was the kicker. Her dad (63)... I know growing up, my wife always talked about how he liked to have financial responsibility and security. So he was very financial savvy with her. But he never really shared how much he makes or made, or how much he has. He never liked the idea of \"free handouts\", but he would help her in her financial needs. Like paying part of her college tuition, buying her a car as long as she takes care of insurance, gas, etc., Which is a good mindset to which we agree with. He has spoken to me about his retirement funds (somewhere in the couple millions range), and how much he makes (somewhere in the $150k/yr range) so I know he doesn't need money. My wife knows he doesn't need money but doesn't know how much he has.\n\nWhenever we talked to them about babysitting, they loved the idea. Since her mom would be retiring it would work out perfectly. And they'd get to see their grandchild every day or most days. Soon after we had our baby, maternity/paternity leave was up. I was going back to work, my wife had another month left, and her dad started talking about paying them for babysitting. Seeing as he wasn't fond of the free babysitting, he started to compare pricing of daycares in today's market and how much he would start charging us weekly. After his research, he surmised his amount to $400/wk for babysitting and $100 for weekends and we were shocked. We thought to ourselves, at that rate we might as well just take our baby to a daycare, and not have to drive back and forth. We weren't upset with having to pay them because we wanted to pay them, and we knew we weren't going to take advantage of the situation. We only started to get upset when he started demanding that we pay them for babysitting. And it's not like my wife and I were well off either, we make enough to live comfortably.  So it became a huge discussion between us to the point where we almost decided that they weren't going to see their grandchild unless we decide to see them on the weekends. \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to pay my in-laws for babysitting? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Is there an option in which you could have them watch your child 2 days a week and then the child to daycare for the other 3?\nI would only say ESH for not discussing it in more detail sooner. It takes time to find a daycare and also to prepare for a 1600/month commitment. Assumptions were made on both sides that needed to be discussed sooner so everyone's expectations were set and on the same page.", "YTA.  If you are upset maybe YOUR parents will do it for free.", "So you assumed that they would be watching your baby full time for free? And you didn't work out an arrangement and come up with a plan? You never sat down to work out the logistics and the details? You've had around a year to figure this out. \n\n\nTomorrow, please start calling daycares in your area. Ask if they have immediate openings for a newborn, and find out what the cost is. (Spoiler alert: it can be incredibly difficult and sometimes impossible to find newborn care.) IF you can find an opening, take it. \n\n\nSo $400 a week for newborn care is a steal. You should be thanking them. YTA.", "YTA. Your kids are YOUR responsibility. Your parents raised you to adulthood, and with that, their responsibilities to you have ended. They owe you literally nothing at this point, and anything else they do is at their discretion. Meanwhile you want to totally pawn your future kids off on them. \n\nPlease, don\u2019t have kids, because you clearly don\u2019t want to actually raise them.", "YTA. Both for expecting free or almost free full time 40+ hours a week childcare, but even more for threatening to keep the grandchild from the grandparents if they don\u2019t agree to it. \n\nBTW what does the wife think of this ultimatum?", "YTA. Why do people expect the grandparents to watch the grandchildren? Also, $400/week to have family watch your kid...what a great deal! Like you said, you could pay the same amount at a daycare where your kid is raised by strangers and the chance of the baby getting sick is increased because your kid is around other kids at the daycare.", "NTA. Future Nana here. I would MUCH rather care for my grandchildren for free than see them in daycare. I have told my children I will be free daycare once they have children. I would be very hurt if my kids wanted to put their children in daycare instead of having me care for them in their own home.\n\nIt seems to me that parenting is getting harder and harder. Most families need two incomes, and it is just brutally hard for mothers especially to juggle it all! I personally think society should gravitate back to closer multigenerational families that live in close proximity to one another. It takes a village to raise children, and the best village is extended family if that is possible.", "NTA", "YTA. You took all things into consideration, most important, the proximity of the wife\u2019s parents so they could babysit. But did you consider they may not want to be your full time child care? It\u2019s a rhetorical question because obviously you did not. I say again for those still reading, YTA.", "NTA. It was discussed. Sounds like the grandmother was totally up for it and the grandfather nixed it.", "Lol. You expect the people who raised you to also raise your kids? YTA", "YTA  when you talked to them about babysitting were you clear that you meant full time all day every day for free?  How does your wife feel about you essentially blackmailing her mom into babysitting.  ALSO how much her parents make is absolutely none of your business.", "YTA. There is a huge difference between grandparents babysitting and looking after your grandchildren for 40+ hours a week plus date nights. My mum loves both my kids but thats because I parent them, I dont expect her too. She takes my oldest, has fun with him and then drops him back to me. May occasionally take him for a night or two but its always her choice. I was the one who had my kids, and it wasn\u2019t for someone else to raise them", "ESH. You should be paying SOMETHING for your grandparents babysitting. On the other hand you repeatedly brought up that it was the plan for them to babysit and only when you're down to the wire that grandpa goes \"I want us to be paid market rate to babysit\". Which is weird since...well if he's also working he's demanding you pay him market rate for what grandma is doing all the work for. Maybe he's sticking up for her, maybe he's trampling over her desire to babysit to prove a point by making you pay market rate.", "It depends how it all went down, from your post it seems like they agreed to babysit instead of daycare, before the child was born, then right before they were supposed to start looking after the baby, they decided to charge you the same amount as a day are would. And if that's the case NTA, they should have told you payment expectations earlier. But if you just expected free childcare and only just told them how frequently they would be required to do it and that's why they responded as so, then yes you are an asshole. It's your choice how you proceed from here, if it's the same cost, then you could do as you said put the child in daycare and save yourself the drive, then in laws can come see the baby on weekends of they want. Or you can keep the peace and pay the in laws what they want.", "These people are retired, you know the thing you do when your done working and have saved adequately to not have to do it again?

You are asking them to do a job for you and they deserve payment. You may be able to negotiate rates (home daycares usually cost less), but absolutely pay.", "YTA tbh. You don\u2019t expect them to babysit, you expect them to be a full time daycare. I\u2019m all for family to help out every now and then with looking after children (if possible of course), it does take a village, but that\u2019s OCCASIONALLY, not all day every day. If you want a full day childcare arrangement, it costs. It\u2019s completely reasonable to not want to do this at all actually, you are lucky they consider doing it at all.

You are actually asking OLD PEOPLE how they feel.  That should give you some perspective\n\nYTA", "Most definitely NTA. My grandchildren live between 2 and 5 hours away, if there\u2019s not a lot of traffic. They need me, I\u2019m there. I wouldn\u2019t dream of asking for payment, my reward is spending precious time with them and the wonderful relationship I have with all of my grandchildren and bonus-grandchildren (the children who were born before their parents were in a relationship with my children and my step-children). The parents have in the past offered me money for fuel, I refuse because that money can be spent on the children.", "This must be a cultural thing, but for me - NTA\n\nIn my country (EU) it would be unthinkable for grandparents to ask money for babysitting. My parents told me up front they feel too old and don\u2019t have the energy to chase a toddler full time, and that is totally fine. They see him often and jump in sometimes when he\u2019s sick or for date night. But they would never ask the commercial rate to look after their own grandchild. \n\nMost grandparents here do look after their grandchildren for free, usually all summer long on school breaks and when they are too young for day care. It is thought of as a perk and privilege. I spent all summer with my grandparents, those are treasured memories for both sides and I was always very close with them. Now my 90 year old widowed grandmother lives with us and we all help care for her. \n\nIt\u2019s not using each other and entitlement, it\u2019s family bonds and multigenerational closeness.

I never babysat my own grandchild when my son had her.  They\u2019re adults, planned to conceive and responsible for daycare, not me.  The topic of me babysitting was never even brought up by them, as adults they simply handled their own affairs.  This is how it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nI should add here that my son also makes a mid six figure salary and works from home.  No one was struggling or suffering \u2026", "Yta i got Kids and maybe max 1 day a week for free is the max. A full week wtf why even have Kids if you not going to raise them", "YTA. You are asking for full time day care, not \u2018babysitting\u2019. Their time is valuable just as much as yours is.\n\nBe smart about this and take the emotion out of it. Since this will be a business arrangement among the four of you, treat it as such. What is their rate, their sick kid policy (very important), and their availability (any appts or vacations when they can\u2019t provide care?). Compare this to the other options you are looking at. What they are offering could be a better deal, maybe not.", "Um, compromise? What's with the all or nothing scenario?

They\u2019ve put in their time raising us and it should feel like a fun time to babysit, not a full time new job.  I\u2019ve also watched it ruin a few relationships as the parents are there so often that husband and wife get into it and have no alone time.  I could see maybe giving them a gift card here and there or buying them something nice now and then but my parents would not charge us.  We don\u2019t have kids yet but we\u2019ve decided we\u2019d have our parents doing one day each as they\u2019ve asked for that and we\u2019d pay for daycare 3 days.  What\u2019s hard when it\u2019s free or grandparents is that you can\u2019t get annoyed, mad or put rules in place.  We would need someone here at 7am daily, can you get mad at your parents if they\u2019re late?  When paying, you can drop kid off at certain time or request someone be at your house by a certain time.  If babysitter is always late, you can find someone new.  When paying, you can say kid can eat this or not that, you can\u2019t tell grandparents that.", "Sorry but it really depends, my grandmother used to babysit me while my mother was working and my mother does the same now with my son 3 times a week but this is the norm here, grandparents help if they can and in return you help them when they get older instead of leaving them at nursing homes.", "YTA. An entitled one at that. They don't have to dedicate 40+ hours a week to babysitting their grandchild because you and wife feel entitled to their time.

Daycare can be fussy when kids are sick (and they get a lot in daycare) so Grandparents backups can be handy. \n\nMy SIL used this strategy and it's worked pretty well. When the Grandparents have gone on holiday, she has been lucky enough most times to get the extra days in daycare because she is already a current customer.

This led to a huge fight in which our earnings were criticized.\n\nThen when holidays rolled around we had to toggle which relatives we were visiting for which holiday, my wife\u2019s relatives lived two hours away so trying to see both sets of families became too much work with two toddlers. My parents ended up blowing up about thanksgiving and threw \u201cfree daycare\u201d in our faces and how unappreciative we were. The next year Father\u2019s Day came around and we were going to visit my wife\u2019s grandfather in the morning (she doesn\u2019t have a relationship with her actual father, her grandfather was her father figure) , THEN visit my parents in the evening, we were going to try and do the dreaded 4 hours of road time and two family visits thing\u2026 Which then led a huge fight chock full of insults  and my mom saying to my wife \u201cYou don\u2019t even have a father, what do you need to celebrate Father\u2019s Day for?!\u201d.., and led to us finding daycare and not seeing them for a few years. \n\nI then was offered an out of state job which would pay enough for my wife to be a SAHM while they were young and we took it to get away from the family problems as the most prominent reason. \n\nFast forward 13 years and while I\u2019m on good terms with my parents now, we only see each other every other year for a few days. FaceTime chats are uneventful and boring, they don\u2019t have a great relationship with my kids and don\u2019t really know them.  \n\nIf I had the opportunity to do it all over again I would NEVER accept the \u201cfree\u201d childcare.  Shit wasn\u2019t free AT ALL. Not to suggest all parents offering help will act this way, most won\u2019t, but there will likely be expected behaviors or actions in return for the help. \n\nPay your parents or pay a sitter.

If they did attempt that discussion and OP wouldn't accept that, sure they'd be the asshole, but it sounds like they just came out of the gate with \"we're now only going to do it at a price,\" which IMO is an asshole move. Whether they're doing it because they really just want to make a profit (assholes) or if they're doing it to play manipulative games to get the result of not being sitters again (playing games rather than trying a reasonable discussion *first* is an asshole move), the only situation they'd not be assholes is if OP left out a whole stage of attempted discussion first before putting on the price.\n\nAt worst, I think ESH.

I also agree that if grandparents want to be paid the same as regular daycare but regular daycare is more convenient for mom and dad, it makes sense to go with that option. And if kid is in daycare while mom and dad work, then it makes sense that the grandparents will automatically have less opportunities to bond with or see the baby, bc when mom and dad arent working they\u2019re going to be wanting to get stuff done around the house, bond with baby as a family unit, and generally just relax.

(I work I get 5 weeks myself) Most of my friends who retire love to travel on retirement I am talking one holiday every couple of months going to visit friends etc.  I have met many on a 3 month trip around Europe because finally they can or past minute.  \n\nSounds like there was some cross-communication somewhere because you have sat and really gone through everything hours, days, what you provide in carseat, crib, clothes food long before now.  How much you pay it you have nanny there is normally an allowance for mileage sundry like drinks etc etc \n\nTo be honest maybe the MIL agree to this before the baby came but now she realizes what is involved maybe she is getting FIL involved to get it to something manageable. \n\nGo get quotes for a nursery see what the prices are and decide.   But also talk through everything what happens on drs appointments etc. etc.   what happens if baby is sick.  How many years what happens when child starts school it is not normally full days.   \n\nYou mention this is first Grandchild, does your wife have siblings, if they do this for your child they need to offer for the others as well.   \n\n\nFor reference when you say in your comments you will pay for everything for your child but not for additional they need to cover, what do you mean? You say you were willing to pay how much where you thinking of paying to the person who is responsible for the care well being, development, organization your child\u2019s time for 40+ hours a week.", "YTA. The grandparents were excited to babysit yes, not run a full on daycare.

I even changed professions and retrained so I could work round my husbands job so one of us was always home.

I think it also helped that whenever we visited my parents it was still me or my husband that ran around for our kids not expect grandparents to do that for us.\n\nIt was hard as I never got weekends with my kids. On my days not working I still had to run about and get them to school, sports and activities. On other days I\u2019d drop them off to school on my own way to work and get out to pick them up and take them to their clubs.

He has, as someone said above, a very non-linear, indirect way of communicating.\n\nAlso, 100% agree. The request was for full-time daycare, not an occasional babysitter. Different things. And...the OP is not mad over paying the grandparents but over the fact that the grandparents are asking for reasonable payment? So he expected them to take whatever pittance he personally decided to drop their way?\n\nOp, YTA.", "Grandpeasants is wonderful! \ud83d\ude06", "And again, I don't really know if it's a stereotype per se, and I really don't want to paint EVERYONE with the same brush, but that is my experience and the comments we get from friends with young (or now older ) kids that never got any help from the grandparents re: babysitting.\n\nIn fact, one of my sister's best friends has 3 kids: a set of twins and a younger daughter, all under 5. Both she and the husband work. Her dad told her 1. Don't expect any help babysitting, and 2. He doesn't do diapers or kids in his car.  Like WTF kind of parent says that? And it's not like this girl or her husband are A-holes or leaches or trying to take advantage. He legit said that from day 1.\n\nI don't get some people. But again, I was raised differently. And I don't know if that's a cultural thing, or just a decent family/parents thing. Probably realistically the latter.\n\nEDIT: And as for the 'streotype\" observation from my father with the guys he worked with, it was probably the types of people he worked with more than an \"American\" thing, but it just so happend the ones that said it at his work were all the Americans, whereas the immigrants were always talking about or with their extended families (kids, grandkids, etc). So that's the impression he got over 40 years of working in this country.", "Honestly, it sounds like a bait and switch on the FIL\u2019s part. Though I do see where the confusion is coming in, with people assuming he didn\u2019t talk to them before hand because that isn\u2019t explicitly stated but he says MIL was excited about it watching the grandkids and even retired early to do so. They obviously had conversations beforehand with the FIL/MIL.", "At least five days! There were weekend rates discussed in there as well.", "That's not entirely true. Sometimes, people create a situation where you aren't left with the option to say no. Where saying no can mean serious harmful impact upon a child and when you're related that child it becomes impossible to say no.", "Yeah, given FIL's history with finances I think he saw what daycare costs now and just got dollar signs in his head. There's a reason he has millions set aside for retirement, and it's not because he's been generous with people through his life. \n\nPaying them is absolutely a good idea. Paying them like they are trained professionals in ECE and child development is ridiculous. \n\nWe don't pay those people enough (thanks, economy) but that doesn't mean FIL can somehow make up that difficiency on a personal level.", "I wonder if he comes from a family where they watch their kids for free. Some families watch their grandchildren for free. Heck, even my mom watches my daughter a couple of days a week for free. We offered to pay her, but she didn't want any money.", "I hadn't read his other posts. that's fucked up about the cat. \n\nwe have 3 which we got with the understanding my wife would handle the litter boxes. then we started trying for kids (he was born this December) but that meant that from 2019 on I've handled the cats just in case.", "They clearly said it because of OPs \u201csick of people getting handouts while I deserve them\u201d post history.", "Having shiny scales also makes them more attractive to predators so she\u2019s really just dooming them all.", "NTA, even though I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be downvoted due to the sheer number of YTA. Maybe it\u2019s an American thing, but the idea of paying grandparents who want to spend time with the child is strange to me. It doesn\u2019t sound like you expected free childcare 24/7. It\u2019s totally absurd that they expect you to pay daycare prices. I\u2019d just send the kid to daycare and they can see the child when it suits everyone.", "I don't think they meant \"if you don't do this you won't see your grandchild\" - I read it as more \"if you don't do this, you'll only see your grandchild when we decide to make time on the weekend to come visit\"\n\nI may be wrong, but I'd prefer to see it as the less extortion-y version", "You're not the only one who's said it so it definitely seems like it's a shared impression of Americans. I hadn't heard it before and it's so interesting to me because it hasn't been something I've observed in my small circle. I'll consider myself lucky that I know a lot of awesome, helpful grandparents who love being with their grandkids!", "I\u2018m so glad my brother isn\u2019t like this.\n\nOur mother died a few month ago without leaving a will which means that we inherit half each. Not only isn\u2019t this a problem for my brother, he even offered to let me have a bit more (not that our mother left much) because I \u201cdid so much caring for her and handling her affairs over the years\u201c"]}
