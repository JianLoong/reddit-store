And if only one person is putting in effort, I'd say the one who expects to be catered to isn't the REAL friend", "> a **real** friend understands \n\nI hate people who talk like this.  Its pretty sarcastic/passive agressive.  \"A **real** brother would make me a sandwich and bring it to me\"  You just can't slap on \"**real**\" as a way to set some universal expectation to a title/role.\n\nIn this particular case, Bill can be a \"friend\" but is just not a \"family-friendly friend\" (eg. being acceptable be friends with children directly or with them around).", "i should\u2019ve clarified. \n\n\nmy wife and his fianc\u00e9 are friends, too. he and i hang out and golf and such, but my family isn\u2019t comfortable going to his apartment.", "I want to know why Bill would invite someone over if HIS partner has homework.

Once in a while is fine, but every single time is exhausting and unfair.", "Simple and reasonable for one person. \n\nMaintaining friendships as you get older is work.  Its even more work once kids are involved.  But the onus of being inconvenienced shouldn't always fall to one party.", "I don't see why smoking outside is impossible. First, having a smoke takes a moment or two, if you need to have one. Second, I live in an area with -35\u00b0 winters, and I know parents and nonparents who smoke and who don't, and this never comes up. Bring your kid, smoke outside or don't smoke at all, for a visit. I don't understand why this isn't possible.", "You don\u2019t need to be more accommodating. Just blame the ~~baby~~ kid lol. (Which is 100% valid). Just make it casual and not a big deal.

We are more than accommodating, have you ever tried to see your childless friends?

OP said they couldn't do what they wanted at the time (no babysitter on short notice) and offered an alternative. I'm pretty sure OP said they do go over, but currently, it's too cold to go on the balcony, and they don't want to partake in certain activities around their kid. OP is right too. Being in Eastern Canada, it's been about -4F the last 3 or 4 days, I imagine it's not far off there.\n\n\nIf anything, the real issue here is that both people seem tied at the hip to their SO. It seems like the issue is OP can't go without his partner (since she could watch the kid), and Bill can't go without his because they have homework.", "And in OPs case it doesn't, they specified it was because of how currently cold it is in the Northeast to be on a balcony smoking, and it is cold.

That doesn't mean that you don't have to put in the work if you want to maintain friendships.", "This didn't seem like the case to me this time. OP basically said \"sorry bro, I can't. You can come here though.\"\n\n\nThat doesn't really sound like catering in this scenario.

I get the cold lol.  \n\nBut is there a reason why he can't leave the kid with mom for a few hours?  That is the issue I have with a good friend of mine.  Essentially, he rarely will leave the kid with his wife, and will only hang out if I go there. \n\nLiving in a climate with real winters, he is essentially saying \"if you want to hang out with me in the winter, you have to come to me\"", "Ohhh okay that changes everything.

But the fact that is it essentially \"all winter\" makes me feel a bit different.  So yeah, he said it this time.

I said somewhere else that the real issue seems to be the 2 couples are attached at the hip.", "Maybe he doesn\u2019t want to? Working parents have limited time with their kids on evenings and weekends. Some parents and *gasp* enjoy spending time with them.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes friendships go through phases depending on where everyone is in their lives.  I am the last of my friends to start a family. I was the friend making accommodations and reaching out\u2014that\u2019s just how that phase of life was. And now my friends are on that side of it now that their kids are older and more independent. Our friendships endured over time.  We all value our friendships but also understand that their partners/kids/families will be the first priority.\n\nReading the post and some of his replies, it does sound like he goes over to Bill\u2019s apartment and they do hang out.

This seems to be it. \n\nIts like, why can't they trade off.  If the wives are friends, why can't they just do a \"ok, the guys will go to friends house today while wife stays home with junior, and next week, OP will stay home with junior and wife and girlfriend can go hang out\"", "I mean, I get you only get so much time wiht your kids, I truly do.  But I also think its fairly healthy for adults to maintain friendships as well, and sometimes that means doing stuff without the kids", "NTA. Your obligation is to your family. Your friend needs to grow up and realize you can't just hang out.", "NTA."]}
