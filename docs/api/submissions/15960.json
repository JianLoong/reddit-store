She and James live together a few towns over, but will occasionally spend the night at the house if we\u2019re all doing something the next day. My daughter \u201cElizabeth\u201d (28F) lives with myself and my husband, paying rent. She also gets along well with Adrian.\n\nElizabeth contributes to the grocery bill, as well as buying things that are just for her. She\u2019ll share, but she has a lot of favorite snacks that she tends to keep for herself. Elizabeth is a self-described \u201cscavanger\u201d, she rarely eats full meals and just snacks throughout the day.\n\nLast weekend, my husband\u2019s family was having a reunion that lasted a few days. James and Adrian came to stay with us so they could be closer to the festivities. During the time they were there, Adrian ended up eating a good portion of my daughter\u2019s snacks. Some were labeled, others were not. The unlabeled ones are snacks my husband and I don\u2019t eat, so she doesn\u2019t have to worry about anyone eating them. Elizabeth had just gone to the store. She wasn\u2019t devastated or anything, but was clearly a little upset. I gave her money to replenish.\n\nI talked to Adrian in private and said please do not eat Elizabeth\u2019s snacks. I said in the future, all of them would be labeled so there\u2019s no confusion. If there\u2019s a label, don\u2019t touch. The rest, is totally up for grabs. Adrian said this was rude and as a guest, I shouldn\u2019t tell her what she can and can\u2019t eat. James thinks it\u2019s no big deal if Elizabeth has to replace the snacks. I said if it happened again, I would create a special cabinet for when they visited and outside meals, that would be the only one Adrian could snack from.

You are being a good host by offering them food and snacks. What you are not offering is your paying renter's food. Your daughter is renting from you and they need to respect that new boundary. If your son and his girlfriend were to move in with you then that respect would be extended as well to not have others eat their food.\n\nAnd truthfully the fact that his girlfriend argues with you and takes what she wants is shocking.

Adrian ate the lunch I clearly labeled.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing rude about saying that certain items aren't for guests.

Pick your battles, etc. \n\nAnd you suck a little bit - sorry - because Elizabeth is an adult, and if she was in any way put out, it was on her to chat about it with Adrian. I'm unclear why you took it on yourself to put yourself in the middle of that.\n\nIt sounds like you like Adrian and she's done you the courtesy of responding honestly about how she feels.\n\nTldr : Sometimes it's an art having to negotiate these things.

I've certainly been in situations when a host/homeowner says, \"help yourself,\" only to follow up with an amendment (\"oh yeah, that's my mom's tequila, don't touch it\") and the correct response is, \"my bad, won't do it again.\"\n\nGotta take responsibility for those actions.", "NTA Adrian sounds very rude and entitled. \n\n>Adrian said this was rude and as a guest, I shouldn\u2019t tell her what she can and can\u2019t eat\n\nI absolutely don\u2019t agree with her, but that argument is easy to counter at least. As a guest in YOUR house she can have YOUR snacks. She is not Elizabeth\u2019s guest so she cannot have Elizabeth\u2019s snacks. Elizabeth is essentially a renter in your house and thus not the host of any guests so her things that she buys for her own money are not up for grabs", "You, OP, are NTA\n\nAdrian is un-effing-believably rude and entitled. And she is modeling that behavior to your son. \n\nYou might consider telling James that if Adrian feels that she is entitled to eat anything she wants when she is visiting, the visits will not happen.", "Your son\u2019s gf specifies that she\u2019s a guest and should be treated as such. Show her these rules for guests\u2026 https://debretts.com/golden-rules-for-house-guests/", "NTA son's girlfriend was extremely rude. Who takes food in someone else's house without even asking?", "NTA \n\nThe audacity of Adrian and your son. Next time, make them pay for it. Just because she is a guest, doesn\u2019t mean she is entitled to food she didn\u2019t buy and was labeled", "NTA... accidents happen sure and you totally handled that well.... GF is entitled.... labels should be fine...  what if your daughter had a medical condition and needed that for diabetes or hypoglycemia?", "NTA Guests obey the rules of the house; they don't make them. All access all the time is her rule, not yours.", "NTA. You handled this entirely appropriately in my opinion. Adrian is very entitled to think she is welcome to eat whatever she wants from your house. I\u2019ve never had a guest behave that way (I\nOr think it\u2019s norml) and I\u2019ve never behaved that way myself.", "Soft YTA: I would never create or be involved in this type of drama over food. She doesn't live there and visits occasionally. Either put the food up that is off limits or it's up for grabs.", "I hate it when people say stuff like \"it's no big deal.\" If it's not a big deal for Elizabeth to do it then it's not a big deal for you to do it. So go to the store and replace your sister's snacks.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c", "My mom always taught me to ask before I take. I have always had a fear of eating something I shouldn\u2019t unless I\u2019m offered. I\u2019ve gone to friends homes where once it was established, I could help myself, but even then I always felt the need to ask. I do the same, I buy stuff for my guests or bring my own if needed. Stuff costs money or sometimes I\u2019m saving things for certain occasions. Just because it\u2019 food doesn\u2019t make it up for grabs. I even ask now when I go back to visit my parents just in case they\u2019re saving something to cook with or eat.", "Happy Cake Day!!!", "> Um...NTA, but I would not welcome Adrian to stay at your house ~~for longer than a single night,~~ anymore. She's a terrible guest and kinda a s**t person.\n\nagreed", "Right!!! I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep properly that night from the guilt", "NTA-A good guest respects their host and doesn\u2019t eat whatever they want.", "I rolled my eyes so hard that I'm seasick.", "I absolutely can not imagine being a guest in someone\u2019s home reacting any way but being mortified and offering to pay for snack replacement when confronted like this.", "I have been with my husband for almost 17 years, I still feel uncomfortable grabbing myself food at his siblings houses (even though they have told me numerous times it is ok). No way could I imagine acting like the girlfriend in this post.", "Similar. I\u2019ve been with my partner for \u2018only\u2019 11 years, but we visit their parents 2 or 3 times a year, for a few days at a time each, and stay there because they\u2019d be offended if we got a hotel (even though there\u2019s a pretty decent but inexpensive one less than a mile away). \n\nWhile they always say \u201ceverything is up for grabs\u201d, the only things I eat that aren\u2019t directly served is an English muffin for breakfast, and whatever snacks are put out on the kitchen countertops that we know they bought specifically for one visit, and even those I eat sparingly. I never rummage around their refrigerator or pantry for something to eat.", "This made me chuckle into my coffee lol", "Thanks!", "Legit! Hell, I would have back flipped out the window on the spot and depleted the damn aisle at the store from snacks to replace them!", "Our daughters probably need a support group.
