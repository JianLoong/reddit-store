She and James live together a few towns over, but will occasionally spend the night at the house if we\u2019re all doing something the next day. My daughter \u201cElizabeth\u201d (28F) lives with myself and my husband, paying rent.

James and Adrian came to stay with us so they could be closer to the festivities. During the time they were there, Adrian ended up eating a good portion of my daughter\u2019s snacks. Some were labeled, others were not. The unlabeled ones are snacks my husband and I don\u2019t eat, so she doesn\u2019t have to worry about anyone eating them. Elizabeth had just gone to the store. She wasn\u2019t devastated or anything, but was clearly a little upset. I gave her money to replenish.\n\nI talked to Adrian in private and said please do not eat Elizabeth\u2019s snacks. I said in the future, all of them would be labeled so there\u2019s no confusion. If there\u2019s a label, don\u2019t touch. The rest, is totally up for grabs. Adrian said this was rude and as a guest, I shouldn\u2019t tell her what she can and can\u2019t eat. James thinks it\u2019s no big deal if Elizabeth has to replace the snacks. I said if it happened again, I would create a special cabinet for when they visited and outside meals, that would be the only one Adrian could snack from.

You are being a good host by offering them food and snacks. What you are not offering is your paying renter's food. Your daughter is renting from you and they need to respect that new boundary. If your son and his girlfriend were to move in with you then that respect would be extended as well to not have others eat their food.\n\nAnd truthfully the fact that his girlfriend argues with you and takes what she wants is shocking.

Pick your battles, etc. \n\nAnd you suck a little bit - sorry - because Elizabeth is an adult, and if she was in any way put out, it was on her to chat about it with Adrian. I'm unclear why you took it on yourself to put yourself in the middle of that.\n\nIt sounds like you like Adrian and she's done you the courtesy of responding honestly about how she feels.\n\nTldr : Sometimes it's an art having to negotiate these things.

That's just some old-school, middle aged nonsense, I guess.", "Lol. I offered a word that seemed foreign itt. Sorry your feelings were hurt. But people who know the meaning of the word can see this host was not gracious.", "It\u2019s very, very different when you visit your very close friends or your mum than if you\u2019re the partner of an adult child staying in that child\u2019s parent\u2019s home. I wouldn\u2019t help myself to anything even in the homes of people I have been friends with for 30+ years. Also, my  adult daughter\u2019s partner has enough manners to ask if he wants something. He knows he can just get a drink or snack or whatever but he isn\u2019t rude.", "Lol. My feelings are fine, and thank you for your consistency.", "Ok. We have different standards for our kids and their partners. I've seen too many of my friends wonder why their sons' wives don't visit and why they have such a hard time seeing the grandkids. I don't have that problem and yes, sometimes it means smiling when it's hard, and finding ways to smooth waters without ever telling anyone they were choppy. My daughters-in-law and I are very close. I like them more than my sons most of the time! \n\nI think if you read my original comment, I made a point of saying it's a grey area and that as host, she has the right to set boundaries. But as an older woman, I think it will serve her better to take responsibility than put the blame on someone else.", "Did you get the feeling people know what graciousness means? Then you're stupid. No condescension. Straight up.", "You think OP should take the blame for Adrian eating snacks that are labelled with Elizabeth\u2019s name? Something that was quite literally, and obviously, Adrian\u2019s fault? That is absolutely absurd.\n\nWhat you are describing as \u2018smoothing waters without ever telling anyone they were choppy\u2019 is a fear of confrontation rather than graciousness or good hosting skills. \n\nNobody is refusing to visit their in laws because the potential visitor has the manners to ask for something they want. Good gods.", ">Then you're stupid\n\n\"I'm not condescending!! Whhhaaaa!!!\"\n\nYes you are, lovie.", "NTA. It isn't rude to ask guests to follow reasonable house rules. Your snack rules are reasonable. They are being rude by essentially stealing from your daughter. Honestly, I wouldn't let them stay over until they agreed to abide by the rules. \n\nI wouldn't bother with the special cabinet. They can follow the rules and eat shared snacks, bring their own snacks, stay at their own home, or find somewhere else to stay. They have options; eating Elizabeth's snacks isn't one of them.", "> Adrian said this was rude and as a guest, I shouldn\u2019t tell her what she can and can\u2019t eat.\n\n\nIt's rude to tell someone to not eat other people snacks????? \n\nAnd eating other people snacks is not rude????? \n\nWow, the audacity. \nThe correct response is: \"I didn't know I shouldn't have eaten those, I apologize. Thank you for labeling them so this mistake won't happen again\". \n\nNTA", "Wow! She definitely sounds entitled. I\u2019ve known my mil for 33 years and would never just help myself. If i want something I bring it with me.", "NTA. Adrian is a guest and should RESPECT your house, its inhabitants, and your rules! Not the other way around. I get that she helped herself to the snacks - that\u2019s forgivable. But to tell you that she will continue to eat them after you were kind enough to take her aside and tell her to not do so is entitled, arrogant, and downright rude. Some people need a lesson on guest-host etiquette.", "NTA\n\nIf you\u2019re a guest in MY house I absolutely \ud83d\udcaf can tell you what to eat and what not to eat.", "NTA. I would never just help myself to someone else\u2019s food but that may just be a cultural thing. In my country you ask first. Even with my family. Actually we don\u2019t ask (except for water), we just wait to be offered  food", "I have a few friends were we both have total acces to each others kitchen, she may say please leave xxx it is for xxx or a party. I then do what she asks, same in my house. Everyone else has to wait for food to be served or snacks put out. If they are hungry just let me know and we go find something together. I would never let normal guests just take what they want. she is a strange girl\u2026.  \nNTA", "NTA Adrian is an exceptionally rude guest and frankly needs to grow up. You never just take from your hosts supplies of food unless they explicitly tell you at the start of the visit \"and please help yourself to food whenever\"", "NTA. She's a rude AF guest! It's rude to go snooping through someone's kitchen and eat whatever you want out of it without asking. If you did that at their place there would be hell to pay. \n\nNext time THEY can replace the snacks they stole. (Better yet, if its only Elizabeth's snacks that got eaten, get Elizabeth a big cupboard with a lock on it that she can keep her food in.", "They can bring food with them", "NTA. You addressed the situation in a measured way, talking to Adrian as an adult. Her response is weird and rude. I can understand her saying something stupid as an initial embarrassed response but not this continued entitlement. \n\nWhen I was about their age I practically lived with my boyfriends parents, every weekend I\u2019d stay at theirs and the pair of us would descend like locusts on their well-stocked pantry. They always kept it well-stocked and were incredibly generous (they were very wealthy). But if another family member had something set aside for them I wouldn\u2019t even dream of touching it. I feel like it\u2019s so weird that Adrian doesn\u2019t get that. Well done for sticking up for your daughter, just because the girlfriend is a guest doesn\u2019t give her the right to be rude and selfish.", "NTA.\n\nI can only think of one other household where I would even dare opening a cupboard without explicitly asking first, that would be my grandmothers, and even then I ask.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a British thing but it\u2019s a huge faux/ outwardly rude to not first ask, and to give that guest bullshit as an excuse, is out of order. I wouldn\u2019t have handled it so well \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "do parents not teach their kids manners anymore?\n\nAdrian is a terrible house guest! \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIf they can\u2019t respect a simple request like that, I wouldn\u2019t be going to the hassle of providing a special cabinet for them. I\u2019d be showing them the door.", "NTA\n\nSo how would Adrian feel if you all tipped up at hers and just helped yourselves to all her stuff?", "ESH - I had to scroll back up to double check the ages of all involved. Why couldn't your daughter handle this conversation with the girlfriend herself? It's her food being eaten that's the issue. If things became heated beyond that, I'd understand getting involved and asking someone to leave your house, but it didn't sound like that's where it was going.  Did your daughter ask you to talk to the girlfriend? If not, why are you getting involved? You suck for inserting yourself. Your daughter sucks for not being able to handle a relatively minor conversation with the girlfriend as an adult.  Girlfriend sucks for overstepping your daughters boundaries. Son sucks for his attitude towards the situation also. But..... Why are you still parenting these adults? A 'special snack cabinet', seriously? Tell them to work it out themselves.", "As a guest you ask before eating anything. Hell, you don\u2019t even open the fridge without permission. \nNTA and Adrian should reimburse you for Elizabeth\u2019s snacks", "NTA And if this happened to me, Adrian would be out the door. As a guest, there are standards to follow, and if she has eaten \"free\" this whole time, she has nothing to pipe up about.\n\nAnd OP, your son is very entitled here. It is his girlfriend, so it is his responsibility if she eats something that is yours or your daughters. He should be the one paying and reimbursing the things his girlfriend wants or takes.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "Let's say she made an honest mistake, maybe got carried away with the snacks... But telling you this? \n\n>Adrian said this was rude and as a guest, I shouldn\u2019t tell her what she can and can\u2019t eat.\n\nAs a guest, you don't go into the kitchen and serve yourself. \n\nAs a family member you learn and accept the rules. \n\nAnd in no capacity you are so rude as to tell your host what rules to make in their home!", "NTA. Adrian is rude and entitled.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdriian and his gf are the AHs here.", "No no no definitely NTA I lived with my partner and his mum for 2 years and even though she gave me open access to the kitchen and snacks I would still buy my own snacks out of respect for her and and my partners siblings who would often visit", "Um...NTA, but I would not welcome Adrian to stay at your house for longer than a single night, anymore.  She's a terrible guest and kinda a s\\*\\*t person.", "Even if Elizabeth were hosting, guests are not supposed to just help themselves to whatever is available without asking! Guests are supposed to eat food that's offered or left out for them, or at the very least ask!", "It's not even just labeled food. When I am a guest in someone else's home I always ask before I eat anything. Adrian is incredibly rude to her in-laws. They shouldn't need to make a special cabinet so she dosen't just steal stuff, that's so bizarre.\n\nI will admit that when I visit my own parents (not my in-laws) I do help myself to some snacks without asking beacuse I know exactly what I'm allowed to eat in that household due to years of familiarity. But if anything seemed different or special I'd double check.", "I've been with my husband for 13 years and we visit his family multiple times a year, and I *still* ask before I eat anything from the pantry.  It sometimes saves me opening a new e.g. peanut butter jar when there's already an open one somewhere, but it also is just the polite thing to do?", "I\u2019m offended because I have the same name lol", "What?"]}
