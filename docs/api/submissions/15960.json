She and James live together a few towns over, but will occasionally spend the night at the house if we\u2019re all doing something the next day. My daughter \u201cElizabeth\u201d (28F) lives with myself and my husband, paying rent.

James and Adrian came to stay with us so they could be closer to the festivities. During the time they were there, Adrian ended up eating a good portion of my daughter\u2019s snacks. Some were labeled, others were not. The unlabeled ones are snacks my husband and I don\u2019t eat, so she doesn\u2019t have to worry about anyone eating them. Elizabeth had just gone to the store. She wasn\u2019t devastated or anything, but was clearly a little upset. I gave her money to replenish.\n\nI talked to Adrian in private and said please do not eat Elizabeth\u2019s snacks. I said in the future, all of them would be labeled so there\u2019s no confusion. If there\u2019s a label, don\u2019t touch. The rest, is totally up for grabs. Adrian said this was rude and as a guest, I shouldn\u2019t tell her what she can and can\u2019t eat. James thinks it\u2019s no big deal if Elizabeth has to replace the snacks. I said if it happened again, I would create a special cabinet for when they visited and outside meals, that would be the only one Adrian could snack from.

You are being a good host by offering them food and snacks. What you are not offering is your paying renter's food. Your daughter is renting from you and they need to respect that new boundary. If your son and his girlfriend were to move in with you then that respect would be extended as well to not have others eat their food.\n\nAnd truthfully the fact that his girlfriend argues with you and takes what she wants is shocking.

Adrian ate the lunch I clearly labeled.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing rude about saying that certain items aren't for guests.

Pick your battles, etc. \n\nAnd you suck a little bit - sorry - because Elizabeth is an adult, and if she was in any way put out, it was on her to chat about it with Adrian. I'm unclear why you took it on yourself to put yourself in the middle of that.\n\nIt sounds like you like Adrian and she's done you the courtesy of responding honestly about how she feels.\n\nTldr : Sometimes it's an art having to negotiate these things.
