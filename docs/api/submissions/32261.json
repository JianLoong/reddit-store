Your SO likely feels overwhelmed, unhappy, and stuck with a sense of duty to his parents -- something he had when you met. He doesn't get to live for himself. Guilt rules him. The fact that his brother does nothing to help puts more pressure on him to carry it. And the reason he feels compelled to stay and care for Mom/parents might be respect, love, devotion for the people who raised him. And that's something that difficult to deal with but those qualities in him might be why you fell for him in the first place. She also might be a narcissist, but being raised by one, he doesn't KNOW anything else/that he's being gaslit and might need professional help with that and the enmeshment I think someone else mentioned earlier.\n\nIt sounds like he's stuck. He doesn't understand boundaries, and that may be something he has to learn in his adult life. If he's willing to learn and set some for you, then that might be a reason to try. Mom sounds dependent but she's also from another time where that was the way it was. Mom sounds resistant to change, and it doesn't much sound like anyone in the family can cope with it.\n\nCaring for someone terminally ill is hard. Primary caregivers are exhausted mentally, physically, and emotionally. The sick aren't always kind. Others might not  understand the difficulty. They're not the one giving the enemas/being screamed at when the sick person is having a hard day/etc. That's not to say caring for someone can't be sacred or beautiful -- it is. It sounds like mom might have resented her husband being sick b/c she'd be alone and that terrifies her, too. We don't know what happened between mom/husband. Maybe he cheated on her, way back in the day and she never got over it and she is full of resentment. Maybe he wouldn't let her learn to drive/find a job. Maybe he hit her. Maybe he didn't and she's just that callous. With older people, it seems like sometimes their inner child just starts taking over.

Hoping the best for you.", "Good for you.", "Please it's been 10 years of this BS, you're not going anywhere.", "Here worst mistake was going back the ***first*** time", "Right?!", "Good luck with that one", "Yeah at the end of the day idk why OP ever thought she had any reasonable expectation of inheriting her boyfriends parents house.\n\nShe says in another sub that they never wanted to get married because she didn't want to help him deal with his tax problems, so idk why she would think she gets a stake in his inheritance.", "You're so welcome <3 I hope it helps. Some of what you said reminded me of my life and relationships, so that's what I spoke to. Good luck!", "There\u2019s a reason why BIL doesn\u2019t visit and OP should have taken that for the red flag it was. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine being so angry at my boyfriend\u2019s Mom and knowing she is a bad person and fucking drunk and then also getting mad that someone else distanced themselves from her. Sounds like jealousy in all honesty.", "Insanity?", "OP either is ludicrously stupid or kind of shitty for hanging around for 10 years hoping to get in on someone else's potential inheritance, especially when she said in another sub that she purposely didn't want to get married because she didn't want to help with his financial issues.", "I get it, I understand I\u2019ve been insane this whole time, but honestly, outside of the parent situation, I adore my partner. He\u2019s nothing like his parents and helped me through the biggest growing period of my life. If he had a huge list of other faults, I\u2019d understand that me staying is ridiculous, but he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s human, of course, but the best human who\u2019s ever loved me back.", "OP talk to a real estate lawyer about all of the money and time you've spent fixing and upgrading that home, to find out if you can sue for compensation or place a lien on the home. You may find out you can't, but if you can it would sure make the move out feel better.", "There is no \"HIM\" without his mother apparently.  So, if you stay you continue to be abused emotionally and financially by her.  If you sat him down and said pick right now me or her.......that is your answer.  You are just stalling and justifying to avoid facing the facts.  Haven't you wasted enough time and money on this horrid situation?  You love him and I get that but apparently the umbilical cord was never severed.  I could not live like that.", ">the best human who\u2019s ever loved me back\n\nThis is going to be harsh but you need to hear it. He doesn\u2019t love you more than his Mom. He will always put her above you. He has done this for your entire relationship. It won\u2019t change now, especially because he isn\u2019t going to believe you\u2019ll leave. Why would you? You\u2019re the sucker who spent time and money renovating their properties and will likely get nothing out of it.", "> outside of the parent situation\n\nface facts, there is no such thing", "> I adore my partner\n\nBummer. Because you are a fairly low priority for him.", "You need therapy. He doesn\u2019t have your back and hasn\u2019t for over a decade\u2026but yeah let his \u201clist of good\u201d override the most important thing. \ud83d\ude44 You have wasted over a decade of your life and what? thousands of dollars renovating properties you don\u2019t even own. He is only \u201cthe best human who has loved you back\u201d, bc you\u2019ve wasted so much fucking time on him. You aren\u2019t even his priority. You have no concept of love.", "Listen. If someone came up to me and goes \"Outside of the smear of shit on some of the bread here, you'll adore this sandwich\". Uh... no. That's still a *shit sandwich*, just prettied up. \n\nYour partner literally let you move away, and he proceeded to be a floor mat to take care of his mama. ***YOU*** aren't who he is in a relationship with, if you've had to have this fight twice before. \n\nTalk to a lawyer as people have pointed out, get as much money back as you can, and get. the fuck. out.", "Unfortunately he is probably not going to exit unless you just leave - no timetable which will be renegotiated later, no ultimatum, just go - and possibly even then.  It's time to tell him you're going and he can join you or not - and you need to be far away from her.  It's not going to end well for him no matter what unless he lets go, and he probably won't, so all you can do is get out yourself and live in peace.", ">  *find out if you can sue for compensation or place a lien on the home*\n\nBrilliant idea!  \n\nStop playing games with MIL, who isn't in a right mind, and perhaps never was.  \n\nYour SO likely has no concept of *normal*, OP, and might not want to get therapy to help himself.  It sounds like he would also benefit from one of those organizations for the families of alcoholics, too.\n\nNTA", "I mean, he told her up front that taking care of his parents was a priority for him.\n\nWhen she found out that she didn't want to live like that, rather than end things there, she engaged in a game of tug of war in which he already said his parents would win", "I think she was thinking more financial and emotional support.  They want two different things so she should leave."]}
