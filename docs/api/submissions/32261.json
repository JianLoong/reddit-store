Away.\n\nIf your partner chooses to come with you, fine, but he's not allowed to do anything more for her mother. Actually I'd insist he go no-contact completely.

This is the third time you gave this ultimatum. Time to push through because you showed him that you threaten but not follow through, so why should he believe you this time. 11 years is plenty!

I hope you'll be able to resolve it to improve your situation.", "NTA- you've invested over a decade and who knows how much money being pushed aside by people who don't give a crap about you. When are you going to be done? This man will never put you first.", "NTA, I think you now know why his brother  hasn\u2019t returned or done anything for them.", "And you need to get the cabin signed over to at least your SO ASAP because who else thinks she\u2019ll leave everything to the BIL who couldn\u2019t be bothered?

That\u2019s not going to change. If it wasn\u2019t for all the time and money that you\u2019ve invested into this relationship, you probably would have been out a long ago.
