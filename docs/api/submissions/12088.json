He is the son of one of my husbands good friends who lives in a different country. The son (I\u2019ll call him Mike ) is 30 but has fallen on hard times and has no one in this area to help him so we said we\u2019d let him stay with us while he figures out his next move. Mike has been here two weeks and came with nothing and is not able to work because of issues I wont go into here. We were aware of this and decided to take care of his basic needs while he stays with us. \n\nWhen he first came it was sudden so I stocked the guest bath with extras from our personal supplies. My husband and use different soap as I have sensitive skin and have to use soap with light perfumes and no dyes. I typically use ivory soap or white dove bar soap,  my husband prefers Irish Springs which I cannot use. When Mike first came the only extra soap was Irish Springs so that is what I put in his bathroom and he had no issue with it. \n\nSince Mike has been here I have been buying things here and there and stocking the home with things he might need. I ask him what he wants but he is not really picky so I just grab things as I do the regular shop. A few days ago I bought myself bar soap as I was out and decided to get a large pack to split with Mike. I bought the Dove white bars. They do not have a particular scent, it\u2019s literally just soap. Not flowery or \u201cgirlie\u201d scented in any way. I left the soap in his bathroom and went about my day. \n\nThat night the soap I left him was stacked up on the kitchen island, so I asked if there was a problem with it. Mike laughed and said no but he\u2019s not a woman and doesn\u2019t use feminine products. I told him it\u2019s just plain old soap and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gendered, it can be used by anyone. He asked if my husband used it and I said no but only because he has a strong preference for Irish Spring. Mike said he doesn\u2019t like to be rude but he will not use girl soap. I said fine and I\u2019ll get him Irish Spring. \n\nI thought it was silly but let it go and was not too worried about it, however, Mike has brought it up a few times in the last few days and seems pretty offended that I would even think he\u2019d use girls soap. He has even started saying thing like \u201c just because I\u2019m down on my luck doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m less of a man\u201d and \u201creal men don\u2019t do this or that.\u201d He genuinely seems irritated with me over it, as if I was questioning his manhood because I gave him \u201cfeminine\u201d soap. I asked my husband what he thinks and he thinks Mike is being ridiculous, but my husband always takes my side.
