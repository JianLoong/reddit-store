The son (I\u2019ll call him Mike ) is 30 but has fallen on hard times and has no one in this area to help him so we said we\u2019d let him stay with us while he figures out his next move. Mike has been here two weeks and came with nothing and is not able to work because of issues I wont go into here. We were aware of this and decided to take care of his basic needs while he stays with us. \n\nWhen he first came it was sudden so I stocked the guest bath with extras from our personal supplies. My husband and use different soap as I have sensitive skin and have to use soap with light perfumes and no dyes. I typically use ivory soap or white dove bar soap,  my husband prefers Irish Springs which I cannot use. When Mike first came the only extra soap was Irish Springs so that is what I put in his bathroom and he had no issue with it. \n\nSince Mike has been here I have been buying things here and there and stocking the home with things he might need. I ask him what he wants but he is not really picky so I just grab things as I do the regular shop. A few days ago I bought myself bar soap as I was out and decided to get a large pack to split with Mike. I bought the Dove white bars. They do not have a particular scent, it\u2019s literally just soap. Not flowery or \u201cgirlie\u201d scented in any way. I left the soap in his bathroom and went about my day. \n\nThat night the soap I left him was stacked up on the kitchen island, so I asked if there was a problem with it. Mike laughed and said no but he\u2019s not a woman and doesn\u2019t use feminine products. I told him it\u2019s just plain old soap and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gendered, it can be used by anyone. He asked if my husband used it and I said no but only because he has a strong preference for Irish Spring. Mike said he doesn\u2019t like to be rude but he will not use girl soap. I said fine and I\u2019ll get him Irish Spring. \n\nI thought it was silly but let it go and was not too worried about it, however, Mike has brought it up a few times in the last few days and seems pretty offended that I would even think he\u2019d use girls soap. He has even started saying thing like \u201c just because I\u2019m down on my luck doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m less of a man\u201d and \u201creal men don\u2019t do this or that.\u201d He genuinely seems irritated with me over it, as if I was questioning his manhood because I gave him \u201cfeminine\u201d soap. I asked my husband what he thinks and he thinks Mike is being ridiculous, but my husband always takes my side.

Dove bar soap isn't feminine. It's gender neutral. I've known plenty of guys who use it, especially those with sensitive or dry skin, but don't want to use baby soap. My hub has a preference to use lavender scented soap; we both can't stand \"manly\" scents like sandalwood or brut, so that's great. \n\nIt sounds like the issue here is more than soap. Your guest is currently down on his luck, homeless and jobless. He feels emasculated by this (which is his problem, not yours), however, he's taking it out on you possibly because you're a woman. Did he bring this up with your husband? You're absolutely right to let the issue go, however he's being an AH for constantly bringing it up. It's time for your hubby to tell him that he's overstaying his welcome.", "NTA. Soap is soap. As long as it gets you clean who cares?", "NTA real men are not threatened by a bar of soap. Be very wary of this man as he is starting to to feel comfortable enough to start having a go at you and that will start to get worse.", "Real men buy their own soap Mike....", "NTA.  And he has some nerve.  And you are a saint, because I would have told him he could leave.", "Maybe you can get him a soap that smells of wood and old leather so he can feel super manly like a real manly man.\n\nNTA, he\u2019s being ridiculous", "NTA. Mike is overly sensitive about his masculinity. I assume this is just because he\u2019s struggling in general rn and he\u2019s taking everything as a sign people see him as less than.", "NTA and you shouldn't take that disrespect, you should tell him that as a \"real man\" he can either use what you buy or find somewhere else to stay", "Only a slight YTA because you are offering Dove \"soap\" to him, but Dove bars are NOT soap. They call it a \"beauty bar\" because it's not soap and can't legally be called soap. Soap needs to be able to dissolve and wash away oils and lipids. Dove does not do that. It's meant to be used AFTER soap like you would use conditioner in your hair after shampoo. If you use it by itself, you are just trapping dirt under a thin moisturizer layer. Hear it from Dove... https://twitter.com/Dove/status/1245065801331326982", "I buy lovely scented soaps from lush for us to use as a household. Can confirm that my husband's penis also did not fall off.", "Ironically, someone that far down the \"real men don't ______\" rabbit hole, shouldn't be able to identify or care about soap brands.", "Yeah dove costs 2x as much as Irish springs at Costco", "Such a good soap! Who doesn\u2019t want to smell delicious?", "My best friend used the proper products for his gender since before he knew he's a guy. He's still stuck with the wrong body parts. If body care products make such changes he'd be an old man now. He switched from the most common man products because they trigger my PTSD and ended up with the stuff my grandpa used (that man had an amazing taste).", "I'm gonna tell your wife.", "You sound cool", "Husband uses Aussie products on his beard (at my request, it was very very dry before) and he smells and his beard feels glorious! He's also bald so idk wtf he uses body wash wise. \n\nBut he's welcome to my scented bath soak and jojoba oil body wash...", "I envy you for being able to use dove. They have the most amazing products and I love their low key scents but they add a conservative against which I'm allergic", "It sounds like you are okay with Mike, so hopefully it's some weird trauma response he has. From an outsider's perspective, he seems ungrateful and seems like he is testing his limits with you (the guilting you by bringing it up). If I were in your place, I would be cautious around him, as it seems he may be the type to try to make an opportunity out of another's misfortune (your \"mistake\"). I am thinking in his eyes you made a \"mistake\" and now he can use that to guilt you, slowly manipulating your feelings. If you, at any time, ever felt bad about this benign situation, then his manipulative tactics are working. He may not even know he is being a manipulative person.... Most guilt trippers don't recognize that about themselves.", "Eh, not quite. It's true that Dove bars aren't soap, but they are cleansers and capable of removing dirt. Most shampoos, shower gels, and handwashes don't contain soap either, other surfactants are available.", "Told my wife instead, she said 'bad' at me.", "That's so nice. I feel products marketed at men tend to be harsher on the skin and hair. They also don't smell as good and don't have all the purported benefits that women's products have like extra conditioning, moisturising, keratin, B5, less menthol and lower concentrations of certain active compounds that can cause skin irritation. More R&D is given to women's cosmetics and toiletries. My husband's skin is so good now since he started using my cleanser and moisturiser that he got his own set when I changed to something else.", "Heads up, if you\u2019re in the US where things are barely not poisonous, Fructis is not good for your hair", "I use Garnier Fructis and my hair is butt length and very healthy. I've tried fancy and expensive shampoos, sulfate free, cone free, blah blah blah, and some have had outright worse effects on my hair, so YMMV.", "Not American. May I know why? I've had some bad experience with Garnier. I've use Fructis hair dye, hair serum and garnier face toner. Each time, my scalp and skin became dry and irritated. I thought it was just me. I'd only used the dye once. Serum and toner were discarded after just a couple of months. \nNever touched their products again since uni."]}
