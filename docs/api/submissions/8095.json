{"id": 8095, "submission_id": "10jj2kl", "title": "AITA for calling my MIL dirty minded?", "selftext": "I (25F) am currently 7 months pregnant with twins. I am a very small  woman and it's very obvious that these babies are taking after my husband Harry (29M) and his family who are all very tall. Adding this to the fact that I have HG and gestational diabetes, I'm having a pretty miserable time right now with constant body aches.\n\nMy MIL (60sF) has always hated me. Partly due to race because I'm black and her family is white, and partly due to reasons that only she herself and God know. The only reason we're not NC with her is because of my husband's grandmother, GMIL, who's very old and sick and currently lives with MIL. I was introduced to my husband through his brother, Adam (26M). Adam and I have known eachother for the past 16 years. I have to also add in here that MIL isn't one of those out and open racists, she's one of those people who doesn't want race-mixing in her family. She's also one of those 'I'm so disappointed, this is such a waste' type of homophobes and Adam is gay. She isn't openly hostile to him either, but once in a while she'll make a hurtful comment. She also views Adam's homosexuality as worse than me being black, and given our very long friendship, would've been completely fine with me being with Adam instead of my husband just so she wouldn't have a gay kid. She's absolutely disgusting and we're all just unfortunately waiting so GMIL can have a peaceful death and we'll cut her off.\n\nOn Sunday, we were celebrating FILs birthday. I got the incredible idea of *walking* myself to the local Walmart to grab a bottle of soda. I probably should've been stopped because I can barely breathe but I took myself there, bought my soda and then got winded and couldn't walk back. I didn't want to give my husband a heart attack, so I called Adam who still hadn't arrived at the gathering and he came to pick me up.\n\nThe one good thing about MIL that I can think of, is that she raised her sons to be gentlemen. Adam has a big car that's hard to get into if you're short so he helped me in, and then when we got to MILs house, he opened my door for me, helped me out and carried my bag for me inside. MIL saw all of this, and over dinner started talking about how 'close' we were. She's done this before, so Adam immediately reminded her that he was gay. That didn't stop her and she suggested that Harry should ask for a paternity test. I responded 'or you could stop being dirty minded'. She was immediately silenced because she's one of those 'im the epitome of morality and how dare you question it' type of people. \n\nWhen we went home, FIL called and said my behavior was inappropriate. He said that MIL wouldn't stop ranting about it all night after we left and I do feel horrible for him because he does have to deal with her bullshit a lot. He asked me to apologize so she'd stop going on about it and he said I would've known to ignore her because we all know how she is. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674497302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jj2kl/aita_for_calling_my_mil_dirty_minded/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
