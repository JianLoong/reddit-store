I get that anxiety is a thing but so is a blood clot from holding a stress position for an hour+ on a train. OP should have had some compassion in this situation.", "I just said zuck but far too many indigenous and others have been forced off land and seen it sold. There\u2019s really plenty in the world that you can pay for somewhere and it be morally disgusting.   I mean you can literally still buy people. Was trying to keep things somewhat light with Hawaii", "I live in the Northeast in the US and feel like my train experiences haven't entirely been what you've described - almost all the trains I've been on have assigned seating in business class cabins and people do generally stick to their assigned seating and will ask you to move if you're in their seat and nobody really gets that annoyed about it because they look at their ticket and see they're in the wrong seat. I've also been on oversold trains (I was just on one earlier this week) and road coach and luckily was able to snag myself a seat but there were quite a few people who had to stand until seats freed up.\n\nNot invalidating what you're saying, but just adding additional perspective. What OP did makes complete sense to me.", "I have no idea why you don't believe that OP deserves to have their medical issue accommodated fairly when they paid extra themself to be accommodated as they required, but I think we can just toss your very ableist opinion directly back into the bin you dug it out of.", "In my country, for most types of trains you have assigned seats, but if the train is full you can buy standing and the price for both types of tickets is the same. So OP paid more  just by buying more tickets, probably the other passengers  paid the same but without seats.\n\nI understand OP is having a hard time, but by doing this it also makes it hard for 2 other people. As OP had the money to buy 2 more tickets I think another way of transportation could be used to be more private and not incovenience other people. I can\u2019t say OP\u2019s TA, but I also can\u2019t say NTA.", "I\u2019m in the ne us too - Amtrak and other train carriers I\u2019ve been on have cabins (that\u2019s what I meant by carriage class) and you need to be in the right carriage but there\u2019s no specific assigned seats. Once your ticket is seen people stick to their seat but it\u2019s not like an airplane where each ticket as a number.\n\nAs far as I know they can at most oversell for limited destinations but I\u2019ve never heard of a distance train that will oversell to the point you won\u2019t have a seat at all. Maybe there are regional and smaller lines that are different but they actually cannot oversell over a certain mileage that\u2019s actually a federal law. I only remember that very clearly from a case brief I flubbed in law\nSchool lol", "Don't they teach the difference between private and public property in school?", "YTA. Even if you paid for your seats. \nImagine inconveniencing the whole world for your issues.", "YTA. They paid the same as you. I'm suprised they didn't just ignore you and sit regardless", "You could have booked two seats without a table.", "NTA you booked and paid for the seats. When I was traveling alone with my one year old twins, I booked 3 seats for us. One twin sat on my lap, the other on one seat, and I had the third one for snacks, bags, etc. The person sitting next to my bag seat tried to move my stuff, But I  had the ticket for that seat. Germans being German, all of the random strangers around me defended my use of that seat, because I had the ticket. My towel was on the deck chair", "Yta absolutely, people were standing and seats free, that\u2019s just dickish.", "NTA.", "NTA but next time put something in the empty seats like a bag or your jackets.", "Rail strikes mean people who booked seats are ending up without them.\nEdit: If OP is in the UK", "Two of the people did try to force the issue, and the train manager gave them the option of getting up or getting off the train - so OP obviously wasn\u2019t the one breaking any rules & the pair who tried to take your seats were the AHs.", "Doing this during rail strikes is a complete AH move.", "The UK is having rail strikes. They could very well have booked a seat and found themselves without one due to fewer carriages or being on a totally different train.", "Yeah exactly. (I\u2019m also in the UK)", "NTA you booked all your sears", "NTA. You paid for them.", "NTA!  You paid for the seats and don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation for why they are empty.", "Nta. You paid,it was yours. No reason to let others use it", "NTA you paid for the seats end of story.", "NTA but I would rethink this strategy for the next time you go on a train ride. Having 2 seats open would invite confrontation with people when they are asked to stand, and I'm sure that would just heighten your anxiety even more. Think of a different plan for next time, all the best, OP", "NTA you paid for the seats", "So if I booked, say, every seat in a train coach, that\u2019s fair to everyone else who needs to use public transport?", "Honestly every train I've been on semi recently has been so delayed by either strikes or singling issues that they've declared that's booked seats won't be followed as they've had to combine too many journeys into one", "I'd argue the main difference is that OP paid for **temporary** exclusivity to the seats, which that the seats revert back being accessible by everyone when OP arrives at his destination. Zuckerberg bought **permanent** land rights and then attempted to use his land ownership to grant himself exclusivity.", "If this is in the UK then the train manager is wrong for giving those two options.\n\nI'll say it again: in the UK you are only allowed one reservation per person, and you are absolutely allowed to sit in reserved seats that are not occupied.\n\nIt's possible that the train manager didn't quite know how to accommodate OP and their health issues, or didn't want the hassle of refunding OP's extra seats and so decided removing the other passengers was the easiest option. But that doesn't mean they were right to do so or that OP wasn't breaking any rules.", "Regardless of when you book, some trains are simply oversubscribed, especially at busy periods like Xmas. OP could well have denied another disabled person the opportunity to visit family at Xmas.\n\nIf OP was wealthy and had the cash to book an entire carriage for 2 people, would you still be supporting them? Where do you draw the line?", "But with Deutsche Bahn your paid for reservation expires if you're not using your seat starting at the first reserved station. I'd actually argue that if that were a situation with Deutsche Bahn, the train staff would allow others on the seat because OP and her friend don't use the two extra seats as it's impossible to sit on two seats simultaneously.", "I agree people are judging without the correct context. I would have actually judged OP the AH if it wasn't clear that they have no experience getting the train. I'm coming from the perspective of someone who regularly gets both short and long distance Trains in the UK. (Which I am 99% is the country we're talking about.\n\nIn an ideal world where its perfectly easy to reserve a seat, there would be nothing wrong with what they did. But it ignores the reality of just how crap our railways are (and have been since well before the strikes started), AND how claustrophobic the trains themselves are. Trains are often filled to double their capacity. On a long distance service, there is no room for standing at all. The aisle is not wide enough to pass someone going in the opposite direction without touching them. The reservation details are displayed in miniscule writing, so you have the shuffle down the carriage scanning desperately to work out which are reserved from what station, while everybody trying to board behind you breathes down your neck. \n\nIf you are standing in the aisle, you can not turn your body to the side without putting your arse in someone's face. There is nothing to hold onto except a tiny plastic handle 2 inches from a seated persons head. There is nowhere to put your bags, and taking your coat off is going to involve a contortionist routine. You probably paid over \u00a350 for this privilege. \n\nBasically, no one is comfortable and no one is getting what they paid for. There is nothing entitled about wanting to sit down. Seats are a limited resource, and OP bought more than their fair share. The actual solution would have been to buy a first class ticket. They are literally designed for people who are willing to pay a premium to be less crowded.", "Exactly. Imagine paying 50 quid for a ticket and having to stand for two hours even though there's free seats right next to you. \n\nI think a lot of posters don't understand how British trains work and how fucking awful they are.", "Then they need to take their complaint to the train service. If the policy is to only sell as many tickets as there are seats on the train, they must have oversold tickets. The people left standing may be due a refund if their tickets guaranteed them a seat on the train.", "Because disability accommodations are the same as toilet paper hoarders, right", "Not exactly the same, but was it really necessary for op to block off an entire table to the detriment of other travellers during a busy period? They had a friend there to support them and people on public transport tend to ignore each other. \n\nAnother disabled person could well have been unable to travel at all over xmas due to this.", "If they are in the UK there is no difference between standing and sitting tickets. The recent strikes have also meant that people with reservations on other trains might have their trains cancelled making their seat reservation void.", "You're right the disabled person should wait to go out until they're not such an inconvenience on everyone else."]}
