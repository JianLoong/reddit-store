Doesn\u2019t mean I side with the manager, but I need to have all facts presented about how the conversation went.

My colleague and I had to drive out of state early one morning so I took the van home, brought in the most expensive tools, but it was still broken into and some of our tools were stolen. They were engraved with our company name.\n\n\nA few months later a cop calls us asking if we had tools stolen. We confirm and meet up with him to retrieve the stolen tools.
