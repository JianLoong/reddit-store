(In this case by getting a manager.)\n\nIf you aren't supposed to walk away from a customer why would you think it's okay to walk away from a manager? \n\nWhen it's a subordinate it doesn't seem right for management to take the position that you're in the wrong for what you didn't say rather than the manager for what she did say.", " They better not be paying min wage and dictating to you your personal life . But also, YTA for being in your 20's and leaving hickies. Grow up", "That's crazy. How were you supposed to know to do that? How were your to DO that?", "NTA - Chrissy is 34 fucking years old, and should know better than to be talking like that about anyone, AT WORK. She's an idiot, and there are consequences to stupidity. Sometimes, when you stick your foot in your mouth, you taste toe. Fuck Chrissy, and fuck any manager who is saying different. Report them too, and take their fucking jobs!", "Nta, great job!", "Wait wait, they think that youre the A for not stopping someone bad mouthing your boyfriend for no reason quickly enough.\n\nIts crazy. I always wonder if some peoples minds just dont really work.\n\nObvioisly NTA. If she gets fired (she should) its because of what she said, not because you didnt stop her", "NTA. Decent people dont need to be stopped before \u201cgoing too far\u201d. Cuz they dont go too far. What she said is terrible, it doesnt matter if she said it about someone you were dating or not. It just happened to be one of the worst people to say that too. She deserves to be fired for saying that about her employee.", "NTA\n\nChrissy engaged in actual harassment and created a hostile work environment. Your work doesn\u2019t require disclosure of lateral relationships so you did nothing wrong. And your relationship with Drew is irrelevant. What Chrissy did was wrong. Period. No exceptions.\n\nAnd she compounded her mistake by trying to have you reported a non-existent issue.\n\nYou\u2019re under no obligation to have stopped her rant to save her from herself.\n\nIf you experience any retaliation from your DM and GM, figure out who is above them in the ladder and report them as well. Or straight to corporate.", "\"Why didn't you interrupt?!\" (trying to somehow make this YOUR fault)\n\"Because I was so shocked that anyone would say such foul things!\" STARE in SHOCK at person who asked the question, daring to try to make this your fault somehow", "Nta", "NTA and your DM and GM are annoyed because they have to find someone to replace Chrissy. The thing is, that they are really the problem. Their annoyance is a clear indication that they are more interested in staffing than staff that are not abusive. It will cost them at some point. Unless there\u2019s a specific reason to stay, I\u2019d start applying elsewhere.", "NTA. Very much NTA. You were not magically controlling her as she spewed her tirade of inappropriate filth. I\u2019m not calling your boyfriend filthy. I\u2019m calling the fact that she dared make **superficial** insulting critical judgements about disability \u201cfilthy.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter that he was your boyfriend although it is great that you were there to speak up for him. If she hadn\u2019t opened her mouth and made fun of someone\u2019s disability in the first place, then she wouldn\u2019t have her current problems.", "NTA\n\nYou're not a mind reader, or her keeper. The shit she says is on her. \n\nReport this to HR too. This is an aggressive response directed at you, in response to them getting disciplined for their actions.", "NTA. she reported you to HR, which means she **wanted** a firing to come out of all this. you were just obliging her.", "NTA and if she'd said these things to you and he wasn't your boyfriend it's still utterly inappropriate and awful and deserves to be sacked for. You shouldn't have to identify when someone is about to be discriminatory about a coworker and stop them from saying this shit.", "NTA. That person definitely should not be in a leader type position. Mean people suck.", "NTA", "NTA.  I'm here laughing at a fast food joint prohibiting relationships between non-management employees.  Come on now....", "NTA. She got herself fired for being ridiculously inapropriate, unprofessional and just plain toxic. She then tried to get you in trouble, when she realized how badly she messed up. She had no business being in management with that level of immaturity and ablism. The other people are just wrong, but they can be wrong if they want to. Even if you interrupted her after the first set of inappropriate insults, she had already crossed the line.", "Nta, fuck her", "What's wrong with hickeys exactly?", "Exactly! I'm not dating any of my coworkers, but talk like that about one of them and you bet your ass I'm reporting you.", "Never interrupt an asshole in the process of exposing themselves.  Makes it easier for other potential victims to figure it out and protect themselves", "No, she should not have said those things. It's not op's job to police the words of their freaking boss. It's entirely boss' job not to bad mouth coworkers to other coworkers.", "Do you have anything about this in writing? Go above them.", "They will, but instead of looking for a new job, run it higher up the flag pole, and take theirs instead. Chat with local media! Make a stink!", "The petty side of me would be rubbing my hands and cackling waiting for them to retaliate. The second they do I'd have all their asses in front of HR with a paper trail", "This. Her behavior was inappropriate, period. It doesn\u2019t matter that he is OP\u2019s boyfriend. What matters is she opened her mouth and vile vomit in the form of words spilled out of it.", "Yeah she was 100 percent making fun on an employee and clearly op jumping in to stop her wouldn't have worked cause when op said they are dating Chrissy attempted to report them to HR", "It's definitely not ops job to police her boss especially considering when she did say something the boss attempted to report her and get her in trouble with HR", "Your mantra is \u201cI was too shocked to say anything until she had already finished.\u201d", "Do not let them blame you for what they said. I'm not a lawyer, but if I were Drew, who I'm sure is a very lovely person, I'd be filing a sexual harassment case with HR. That is absolutely DEVASTATING and you in no way should've had to censor or arbitrate a conflict your boss had with a co-worker (that just happens to be your bf). That makes my blood boil.", "And it's wild that OP didn't even report Chrissy to HR for her blatantly derogatory statements about her subordinate. Chrissy preemptively went to HR because she thought OP would report her, then when HR asked OP what happened they were (justifiably) horrified at Chrissy's behavior.", "Her response to realising how badly she Fd up wasn't to apologise but was to try and get _you_ in trouble? Absolutely NTA", "I don't think that letting an AH hang themselves by being an AH is asshole behavior.  Bravo and NTA.", "NTA - you are not responsible for her behavior, which was disgusting and discriminatory regardless of your relationship to the subject of her disgusting and discriminatory behavior.", "You're not remotely the AH. Anyone who thinks bullying/belittling/insulting co-workers, much less subordinates, is acceptable in any workplace shouldn't be in a management position.", "Never interrupt an asshole mid asshole rant.

Chrissy has what they call \"diarrhea mouth.\" Even if you would have stopped her, she likely would have said those nasty things about your BF to someone else. F - Chrissy. She did this to herself. I wouldn't waste a nano-second worrying about her. Good luck OP.", "NTA.\n\nShe behaved inappropriate. She didn't only discriminate him she was also very mean and cruel towards him.\n\nAnd on which earth is it OK for a manager or co-worker to comment on another employers body? Especially in a negative way? Disgusting and she deserves to get fired.", "Girl, you know youre NTA. Tf is wrong with DM and GM saying you were wrong for not interrupting her hateful rant. I find AM, GM, and DM to be very disingenuous. AM only reported you to save herself because she knows she shouldn't have said that! I suspect GM and DM are only mad bc they have to more more work without the AM!", "NTA, always give idiots enough rope to hang themselves.", "NTA . Making the \u201cgot lucky\u201d joke without knowing it was you , could have maybe been funny , still a little weird but eh .

I\u2019m sorry you had to listen to her, she sounds awful. It\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s being investigated, it sounds like she has very little respect for others.", "She was responsible for an entirely inappropriate rant against Drew.

She definitely deserved to be fired.", "Any one of those comments could have gotten this manager fired, I can't believe she said all of them at once. In the workplace. To someone she supervises.", "And it means she'd be just as happy to tear you down to whomever else will listen as soon as your back as turned.", "What she said would have been entirely inappropriate regardless of any relationship. The AM made a choice to be unprofessional, and can enjoy the consequences.", "I'm not the kind of person that would interrupt a new AM to save them from shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nI would have been much like you were with her, not telling her anything until she was done.

Nothing, they're cool", "How is a hickey disrespectful??", "\ud83d\ude44", "Literally everyone knows marking your partners body in broken blood vessels to be mocked mercilessly by everyone is disrespectful.

Why are you shaming them for having a healthy sex life? I personally see no reason to shame anyone for having a hickey. I see no reason to mock anyone for it. I see no reason to view it as disrespectful. But then again that's just me and once again I don't judge other people for their sex life. If that's something you happen to enjoy, then I suggest therapy, not interaction with the rest of the human race. \n\nMocking/shaming somebody for having a hickey is the act of a 12-year-old, not having one in general.", "1. Hickies are not a sign of a healthy relationship because I guarantee you the receiver is not pleased. \n2. You not seeing a reason for mocking will not stop the mocking. And also is what makes you obtuse over the reality \n3. I agree, mocking sucks. The people who mock are like 12 year Olds, but so is the person that left the hicky.\nYou disagreeing with me over hickies being ridiculous and childish does not negate the fact that they are ridiculous and childish.", "NTA", "No, she\u2019s ableist and hateful and deserves to be fired.

Shaming anybody for anything to do with their sex life is a form of mocking, and that's not okay. It also is what marks you as an ass instead of a reasonable person who minds their own business\n\n3: If you agree that mocking sucks, then you would agree that minding your own business when it comes to other people having hickeys is the polite and mature thing to do, and giving anyone any grief over it would be a form of mocking. That's common sense, at least to anyone with a brain. You having a prudish outlook on life doesn't change that fact.\n\n\nHave the day that karma thinks you have earned, as well as the life it thinks you have earned.
