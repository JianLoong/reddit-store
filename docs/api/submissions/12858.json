When I'm with my mom/stepdad, I cook a lot with my stepdad's mom (my step-grandma).\n\nBut when I'm at my dad/stepmom's house (one weekend a month + some holidays and summers), things are different. My stepmom is not a good cook. I'm sorry but she's not. She has sensory issues, she doesn't cook meat, barely any spices, and a bunch of other things. She also just undercooks, overcooks, undersalts, all of that. In the past I've kind of tried to help her and cook with her and been like what if we add lemon but first of all she doesn't like my input she wants to do things her way, and second of all they're sensory issues so she doesn't want to cook differently than she does. If she ate what I made she would not like it.\n\nAt their house, my stepmom only cooks foods that she's comfortable with, which since my dad never cooks, means any home-cooked meal is something she eats.\n\nShe doesn't care what anyone of us eat when she's not around, like a friend's house or takeout.\n\nOfficially if we're like at a restaurant or if I make my own food for dinner, she also doesn't care. Like if we all go to a restaurant they wouldn't stop me from ordering a burger. BUT she would be kind of uncomfortable, not mad just uncomfortable. For her it's the smell mostly, but it's also kind of a mental thing idk how to explain it. She is in therapy, that's why I think she's able to pretend like its okay.\n\nBut because it bothers her, what would happen is that my dad would order vegetarian, their kids (3/4) would get something like kid-size grilled cheeses and I would maybe order like a chicken burrito instead of a steak. Or like if my dad got takeout, he would throw away the bag in the downstairs trash or leave it in his car so she didn't have to smell it.\n\nI've been cooking more and more. I like cooking and do it a lot at home but like I said her food is so bad that's also a motivator. I eat meat and also cook with spices and strong flavors.\n\nBut my dad came into my room last night and said \"out of courtesy\" could I stop cooking so much and try to eat what I was served more. I said to my dad that her food was both bad and boring (I wouldn't say this to her face obvi).\n\nMy dad said I needed to \"go with the flow\" and couldn't always have my own way. And tbf I can't act like I haven't noticed her not being anywhere in the kitchen like going to the bedroom if I'm making myself dinner tbh. But I said basically that this was her problem, not mine, why should I have to cater to what someone who isn't even eating the food? He said I was being rude and disrespectful to her by \"pushing her limits\" and said it was her home too. And yeah I could make blander food that's more \"safe\" but what's the point?

The obvious solution would be to spend less time with your dad. He chose to marry your stepmom. So he make the choice to be ok with her food/sensory issues. You didn't make that choice. You shouldn't have to starve or eat bad food everytime you visit your dad. So explain you are willing to go with the flow by spending less time at his house. Suggest you and him visit outside of his house. Our you and him go out for meals when you visit so that you don't don't have to starve or eat bad food simply because he married someone with sensory/food issues. I am in no way blaming your step mom for her sensory issue. She should feel comfortable in her own home. Your father is the one with a child who should have thought this out better before marrying someone whose issue may negatively impact his children.", "No youre not the arsehole. Youre making your own food. I dont see how else you can be accommodating. Its meant to be your home too.", "NTA..\n\n Yes you could town down some of the stronger stuff.. bit people with sensory issues cannot expect  EVERYONE to cater to them.\n\n There has to be a compromise. \n\nAre there foods that she can do with that you can learn to cook better than what she does. And only add spices to it for your plate?  \n\nIs there a fan over the stove that can pull some of the smell out of the house so she doesn't have to smell it?\n\nJust these two things can help a lot. If this is not a compromise that can be done maybe you should talk to your own mother about going for full custody instead. Because you are not getting the nutrition you need at your father's house", "NTA - I do feel like there is a compromise somewhere here. Since you all have to live in the same space and both want to be comfortable there. Maybe you cook a little less or if there is a particular smell she absolutely hates avoid that. Or let her know in advanced when your cooking meat so she can take a walk. I don\u2019t think you should have to eat bland undercooked food that you don\u2019t like all the time.

Compromise is required.", "YTA Your step-mom isn't trying to be malicious and it sounds like she's even trying to be understanding and accommodating to others. You even stated that you think \"sensory issues\" is an excuse, which is where I fully sided with YTA. Sensory issues are real, she's trying to improve by going to therapy, but it's not a problem solved overnight. This is an issue of respect. You're causing physical and mental, even potentially emotional distress to your step-mom. Your dad has made a simple request, you're putting your own comfort zone above someone else; someone who, from the sounds of it, has repeatedly put herself aside for your comfort zone. You're being disrespectful, plain and simple.

You could consider eating vegetarian dishes you like while being there. You can probably make a decent plate of pasta without meat. You could suggest cooking with the windows open. Cooking while she's at work or doing errands and opening the windows before she comes back.\n\nWe don't know how old you are, so depending on that INFO, I'd be more or less willing to forgive your lack of communication with her and your dismissal of her issues.

It is her home and she has legit sensory issues.\n\nHOWEVER, what are they specifically asking you to do? It is miserable to eat nasty food especially if you know how to cook. Is there some compromise here? Is she okay with smelling any kind of meats or specific meats? What spices does she have an aversion to? Can you avoid these?
