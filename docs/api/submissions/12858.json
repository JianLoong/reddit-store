When I'm with my mom/stepdad, I cook a lot with my stepdad's mom (my step-grandma).\n\nBut when I'm at my dad/stepmom's house (one weekend a month + some holidays and summers), things are different. My stepmom is not a good cook. I'm sorry but she's not. She has sensory issues, she doesn't cook meat, barely any spices, and a bunch of other things. She also just undercooks, overcooks, undersalts, all of that. In the past I've kind of tried to help her and cook with her and been like what if we add lemon but first of all she doesn't like my input she wants to do things her way, and second of all they're sensory issues so she doesn't want to cook differently than she does. If she ate what I made she would not like it.\n\nAt their house, my stepmom only cooks foods that she's comfortable with, which since my dad never cooks, means any home-cooked meal is something she eats.\n\nShe doesn't care what anyone of us eat when she's not around, like a friend's house or takeout.\n\nOfficially if we're like at a restaurant or if I make my own food for dinner, she also doesn't care. Like if we all go to a restaurant they wouldn't stop me from ordering a burger. BUT she would be kind of uncomfortable, not mad just uncomfortable. For her it's the smell mostly, but it's also kind of a mental thing idk how to explain it. She is in therapy, that's why I think she's able to pretend like its okay.\n\nBut because it bothers her, what would happen is that my dad would order vegetarian, their kids (3/4) would get something like kid-size grilled cheeses and I would maybe order like a chicken burrito instead of a steak. Or like if my dad got takeout, he would throw away the bag in the downstairs trash or leave it in his car so she didn't have to smell it.\n\nI've been cooking more and more. I like cooking and do it a lot at home but like I said her food is so bad that's also a motivator. I eat meat and also cook with spices and strong flavors.\n\nBut my dad came into my room last night and said \"out of courtesy\" could I stop cooking so much and try to eat what I was served more. I said to my dad that her food was both bad and boring (I wouldn't say this to her face obvi).\n\nMy dad said I needed to \"go with the flow\" and couldn't always have my own way. And tbf I can't act like I haven't noticed her not being anywhere in the kitchen like going to the bedroom if I'm making myself dinner tbh. But I said basically that this was her problem, not mine, why should I have to cater to what someone who isn't even eating the food? He said I was being rude and disrespectful to her by \"pushing her limits\" and said it was her home too. And yeah I could make blander food that's more \"safe\" but what's the point?

Your dad of course is playing piggy in the middle and is just trying to play peacemaker between you. Let us discount him, he can go buy take out and secretly eat it in the car. Really, this is between you and your step mum. You are both trying to inhabit what is supposed to be a safe, comfortable space. I grew up with a mother who couldn't cook. Her food was horrific. She would make something fairly okay, that was edible for the family, like egg and chips, then pour minestrone soup all over it. Her liver and onions was like eating an old boot. I was skinny, very, skinny. Of course I tried to take over cooking as soon as I could, but I had a fight on my hands. So I do see you want to eat edible, flavourful food. Nothing wrong with that. But your step mum has SDP.  So do I, but mine is severe on hearing and a certain amount of visual issues. I'm actually okay on smell and taste. But I can see her side. Flavours are too much for her taste. It is flavour on steroids. Texture too is way more texture sensation than you can imagine. So what is bland to you has a great deal of flavour to her.  She is detecting flavours that you could never detect. It is the same with smell. She has got the ability to smell at an incredibly sensitive level. It is overpowering. It is distressing to cope with on a daily level. I know this because sound hurts me, just simple every day sound can be like a band all playing instruments against each other at the highest possible blast. Please understand that your actions by creating so much smell is actually painful to her. Just the same as if someone was blasting music all day in my safe space. You are completely ignoring that and just satisfying your own needs and ignoring her because her food is awful. You could compromise somewhat by making sure you vent the kitchen well and choose your less smelly recipes over the more pungent ones, just to give her a bit of a reprieve.", "NTA but would you be comfortable talking with her directly to ask if there are ways that you could cook things you like that would make it more comfortable for her? Specific foods or spices that are rather hard for her? Ability to cook with the window open, too. Some things are especially pungent- seafood can be very strong and a bacon odor will linger.

I'm living with my son temporary right now and he loves to cook very spicy food with lots of hot peppers. I have acid reflux and asthma, so not only can I not eat it, but just breathing the air when it's cooking can trigger an attack for me. So I don't know what your stepmom's issues are, but I can relate to not being able to tolerate what someone else is cooking just from what's floating in the air. Surely you can handle not cooking for one weekend a month. As far as the summers, maybe talk to your dad about a compromise. Maybe you can get a backyard kitchen set up outside for food prep, grilling etc? Doesn't have to be a quarter million dollar thing. Just a counter and sink to prep food, and a decent grill with all the bells and whistles for different cooking options. That way over the summer you can cook what you want outside and not bother your stepmom.", "NAH I love spices and flavorful ingredients so I understand your point of view. \n\nCertain smells make my throat sore and /or give me headaches: scented laundry soap, cigarette smoke, marijuana smoke, scented candles, etc. so I understand your stepmother\u2019s point of view. \n\nAlso, I abhor open floor plans. For me, it\u2019s essential to be able to isolate scents, sounds and light.\n\nA fair compromise would be for you to cook your food at your mother\u2019s house and bring it with you to your father\u2019s house.

Plan a home cooked meal with your step-mom that both of you can enjoy (if possible)\n\nPerhaps alternate these options each month.", "I dunno, in our home, our kids\u2019 sensory issues will be catered to. I can\u2019t control outside of our home. And if my husband was being disrespected, I\u2019d take issue with it like OP\u2019s Dad. \n\nOP, there\u2019s two problems with this from stepmom\u2019s perspective: 1) You\u2019re saying her food sucks. That\u2019s subjective. 2) She\u2019s being exposed to sights, smells, etc that are really tough for her. If she is neurodivergent, and you\u2019re not living with them 24/7, then you have to compromise. \n\nIf she is cooking food that is unsafe, then, as others have mentioned, maybe a change in custody arrangement may be in order. \n\nThe best thing would be to sit down with your dad and stepmom and see if a compromise can be reached while you\u2019re there at different points throughout the year. If stepmom is neurodivergent, it may be difficult for her to budge from her routines easily.\n\nBeing a child with divorced and remarried parents is not easy and I sympathize with OP on this. It\u2019s a fine line we have to walk between our more full time home and the other parent\u2019s home.\n\nI\u2019m going to say NTA for now because I feel your reaction is very understandable given your age and life circumstances. What you choose to do going forward could definitely but you in AH territory.", "OP is a minor, they should not be paying for their own food.", "O I missed that!!", "Speaking from sad experience, they're a nightmare both to heat and cool. I live in a multi storey town house and the only closeable doors are the bathrooms and the bedrooms. Temps in my area range from 1C/35F in the winter to 35C/95F in the summer. It sucks.", "Or you know she could go somewhere else in the house while he cooks? I doubt he\u2019s taking up the kitchen for an hour plus.", "I have food sensory issues and some smells makes me sick. I don\u2019t ever tell people don\u2019t cook that food. My family opens the windows and turns the hood fan on. I know this is a me issues not everyone else\u2019s so I have many things around my house and car to help me. PERFUME MAKES ME REALLY SICK I HAVE SOMETHING FOR THAT TO. \n\nWhat OP step-mom doing is weaponizing sensory issues which sucks big time.", "This is the smartest response I've seen. I'm sorry, but at 16, you don't quite get a say. Every family dynamic is different, and I can see a lot of extenuating circumstances, but from what you've typed, it's their house and, by proxy, their rules. If you don't like it, try to change the custody arrangement to a parent who listens more, but as it is, it's not that YTA, you just don't get a vote.", "*That* is something I would have to agree with.", "It seems like everything worth eating makes her sick. At some point she\u2019s just gonna have to deal with other people eating their own food."]}
