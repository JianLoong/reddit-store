Like entirely. You got told to kick rocks and eat dirt. \n\nYou legit could tap your renters insurance but only if you have proof you filed a police report. \n\nYou were kind of out of options here other than buy a new one on your own. And James and his Mom showed zero intention of ever owning up, returning it, or paying out. Even your roommate was chill with this. Soooooo get a lock for your door and keep your shit there. It sounds like Mom may have no problems heading to your place and picking stuff up.\n\nThe police aren't likely to do anything other than keep it on file. But at least you can hit up renters insurance if you have it.", "NTA. Your roommate is responsible for his guests. The guests stole from you. They won\u2019t facilitate getting your property back, so police report was the required next step. Good move telling the landlord as well, in case there are any further issues. Maybe have a think whether rooming with this guy is the best idea going forward", "NTA\n\nIf you weren\u2019t handling things correctly the police and courts would tell you so.", "NTA  I see where you concern is.  Your living arrangements have been disrupted by this mess.  Your roommate's mother may have tolerated this larcenous behavior in the past, because her baby has problems.  Good work on the restraining order, but I would start to look for a new place.  This whole episode will leave a trail of damage behind it.", "NTA. James stole an expensive item, you have the proof, of course file the report. \n\nHis mother seems fine with him stealing and blamed it on you for not hiding all your valuables when they came over.  Maybe this will change her mind. Her cooperation with the thief makes her an accessory.", "*My roommate\u2019s mom flips her shit.....

Fuck your roommate and tell his mom it was in your safe space\u2026. YOUR home!", "NTA. You tried confronting them without police intervention, and they wouldn\u2019t budge. Even if it was in your living room, your stuff is yours, and grown adults invited in should know not to steal. Your idea to let the landlord know is also good. If they showed up again KNOWING you had clear footage of him stealing it, who knows what else they\u2019d do.", "\" his brother does have issues and they have been trying to work on it\"\n\nThe restraining order and criminal theft charges will help to expedite them all to \"work on it\"!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEFF all these assholes!\n\nNTA", "NTA.
