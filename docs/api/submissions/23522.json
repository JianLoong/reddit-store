Your living arrangements have been disrupted by this mess.  Your roommate's mother may have tolerated this larcenous behavior in the past, because her baby has problems.

Not \"well of course he stole it, you failed to secure it behind inch thick electrified steel, idiot\"", "Cause bro (James) and mom live out of state. By the time paperwork goes through for any of it. They are going to be back out of state. Sure they could put out a warrant, theoretically. But it's a PS5... 500 dollars. No police station or DA in the world is gonna spend more time and money hunting down a 500 dollar theft case across state lines amongst \"friends and family\" unless they got some other angle they are working. At most the issue an in-state warrant if they eventually question the roommate (lolz) to get an address and actual names and contact info. But once again it's a 500 dollar theft case.... so not only do those fools have to come back in state but then they got to get pulled over or arrested for some other crap before a warrant pops. Unless bro and mom have some other outstanding in the state they love or bro and mom run into problems in state they are gonna ditch the state before any of this processes. And those warrants ride for years. And misdemeanors aren't generally extradition worthy events between states. States will happily rack up no shows and fines over warrants and failures to appear for years on end. (Siblings with long criminal histories so I've seen this go down)", "I wonder that too based on the mom saying that it was OP's fault for \"leaving something expensive out\". As if one would think they had to lock everything up because a mom and 30-something ADULT were coming by."]}
