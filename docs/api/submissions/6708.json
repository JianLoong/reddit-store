I told her why this was happening, and she insisted I didn't know how dishwashers work and that there's no other way to sanitize them. I shrugged and dropped it. We're still friends.

Not berate you for not taking what she said at face value. \n\n\nTbh it has nothing to do with her weight or how often she goes to the gym. She could be a gymbro and it wouldn't be OK.

I'd be pissed if someone dismissed my knowledge because I've become rounder in the last two years. But I wouldn't butt into someone's supplement routine without facts I could back up.

The problem with AITA is that we only get one side of the story. People will both consciously and subconsciously make themself appear better.

Op goes on to say that he \"knowingly offensed her body\" If that doesn't imply that he isn't telling the full story about how he said it, I don't know what is. Someone not listening doesn't excuse your bad behaviour.

Because there's a huge market for nutritional supplements... That's kind of the main point of supplements is to supplement nutrients, vitamins, minerals etc. that you can't get easily from your regular diet. You might take iron supplements if you're not getting enough iron in your diet, for example. A lot of vegans take supplements to fill in the nutritional gaps usually filled in by animal products. I would love to know what makes you think supplements and nutrition are mutually exclusive", "You don't need a blood panel to be recommended magnesium, a balanced diet, or creatine from a licensed nutritionist. Now if he wanted to take exogenous anabolic hormones, then I would recommend a blood panel. Are people really getting blood panels for creatine? Asinine lol", "Exactly, we don't know. You're also jumping to a lot of conclusions and leaning on your \"I'm better than most people\" experience to seem more of an authority on the matter than any of us.", "No, you don't need a blood panel generally for taking basic supplements like this, they are usually safe for people to take with no prior medical history knowledge, buuuuut....\n\nI can't take magnesium. For most people, it would be awesome for muscle repair and great addition to a simple vitamin/supplement regime, but for me, it would have serious side effects because of drug interactions with a medication I take, it could cause kidney failure for my already weak kidneys. \nGym bro, who tries to constantly give me \"tips\" cause I'm a girl in a gym, tells me what I REALLY need for gains is to take a bunch of pills/powders and nom some pre-workout does not have my personal health at the forefront of his decision making, he has anecdotal evidence of the trial and error that worked for him. \n\nAttendance to a gym does not make you a professional. IFBB pro cards do not come with certification to be a dietician or a nutritionist. Seeing a medical professional before adding anything to your body is always better than just guessing.", "I've actually not responded to anyone but yourself, and I haven't insulted you or insinuated even, that you or your opinion are lesser than my own. I have given my own personal opinion, that is built off of ~25 years of participating at  competitive/professional levels in very physically demanding sports, and recommendations I've received from medical professionals during those active times. \n\nSo no, I'm not better than most people, but I do trust professionals, and love sports/people being active, so I try to reiterate the knowledge I do have, to encourage folks to make healthy, better informed, decisions."]}
