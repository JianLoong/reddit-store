I live 1 hour and 30 away but used to live where he does. I drove over, picked him up and drove us to the parade (about 20 mins from his home.) I drove as he was drinking already and I am a DD as I am 1 and a half years sober, I don\u2019t mind. After the parade, we walked to a bar close by. We\u2019d agreed to eat afterwards and agreed to be home by 5 because we both work tomorrow. Around 2:30 I told him I wanted to leave. He was having fun drinking, mingling and had bumped into other friends. He said he\u2019d get an Uber home and I could get started home. So I left. I texted to check in with him throughout the evening, he finally called me around 10, cussing me out and saying that I was a bad friend for leaving him. Reminder, he is a 20 minute Uber from home and is super familiar with the town, we grew up there. I\u2019m really disheartened and sad that he is now saying this. I might be the asshole for leaving him but I felt like he didn\u2019t want to stay on our timeline and it isn\u2019t exactly fun for me to spend hours at a bar, I did stay there for an hour.", "created_utc": 1686542603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/147ee99/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_at_pride/", "score": 219, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
