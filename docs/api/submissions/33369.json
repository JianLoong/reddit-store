I always work from home, but she goes into the office several days per week.  Well, we were both working in our living room, and I got hungry, so I got up to go make myself some lunch in the kitchen.  When I was midway down the hall, I heard my wife quietly say something to me.  It was above normal conversation level, but it wasn't loud enough for me to hear it.\n\nI almost went back and asked my wife to repeat herself, but I have repeatedly told her in the past to say whatever she wants to say before I leave the room, so I decided to simply ignore her.  People may find this a bit rude, but no matter how many times I tell her not to do this, she decides to do it anyway.  I have concluded that she is intentionally doing it to get on my nerves because nobody's memory could be this bad.\n\nWhen I was done cooking my lunch, I was eating at the kitchen table and scrolling through my phone.  My wife asked me if I had made enough for her (I told her that I was boiling pasta before I had left the room), and I asked her if she had made the request before I had left the room or after.  She absolutely refused to answer the question.  I kept asking it over and over, yet she was apparently unwilling to admit that she had, once again, disregarded my explicit instructions to only speak to me when I'm still in the same room, not leaving the room.  She became angry at me, but I calmly explained that the conversation would move forward whenever she was ready to answer the simple question that I had asked her.\n\nEventually, she said \"screw you\" and started making herself a frozen meal from our freezer.  I chuckled to myself, as I finished my food and headed back to my work laptop in the living room.  I couldn't believe how childish her behavior was.  I likened it to a kid breaking a window with a baseball and then saying \"don't look at me!\" while still holding the bat.  My wife has serious problems with accepting responsibility for her failures, and I have decided that I am absolutely done coddling her enormous-sized ego.  Whenever she's ready to answer the question, I'll be waiting, but she silently grabbed her work laptop and locked herself in our bedroom.

So what she tries to speak to you when you leave the room, yes it\u2019s annoying but your response is childish.", "YTA.  It would have been easy to say \"I didn't hear you\" but you wanted to \"teach her a lesson\".  YOU are the overgrown toddler. You knew your wife needed to eat lunch but instead of trying to make enough for both, you were selfish and rude and ignored her.\n\nyou owe her an apology and a trip to a counselor so you can learn how to communicate like adults", "YTA ugh do you even respect her?", "You're making me feel very conflicted about this. On the one hand, you sound like an asshole. You don't even seem to like your wife. On the other hand, yelling at me from across the house is extremely disrespectful, and I also will not participate in that.", "This has to be fake\u2026.\nBut in case it\u2019s not, YTA holy shit. \n\n>I have repeatedly told her in the past to say whatever she wants to say before I leave the room so I decided to simply ignore her\u2026.no matter how many times I tell her not to do this she decides to do it anyway\u2026.nobody\u2019s memory could be this bad\n\nI mean, it could. Both my husband I have horrible ADHD. We both understand this so we adapt. Sometimes he literally won\u2019t even notice I\u2019m talking if he\u2019s too focused on something (work, tv, game) so I ask him to pause/pay attention for a second if what I need to say is important. I forget *literally everything* so if something is important he\u2019ll say it a few times, or even remind me. It may seem annoying to other people, but we **love** each other and we understand that we struggle with certain things so it doesn\u2019t bother us at all to be a little more accommodating. \n\n>I asked her if she had made the request before I had left the room or after\n\nYou\u2019re talking to her like she\u2019s a child. This all could have been avoided if you didn\u2019t have some weird hang up about her **only** being allowed to talk to you if you\u2019re in the room, and had gone back to hear what she said. \n\n>I kept asking her over and over\u2026..she had once again disregarded my explicit instructions to only speak to me when I\u2019m still in the room\n\nDude some people don\u2019t pay attention to every single thing you\u2019re doing and know exactly when you\u2019re leaving the room and when their cutoff from being allowed to speak to you is\u2026also what if she didn\u2019t have the thought until after you\u2019d left the room? This is a ridiculous ask, in my opinion. And you\u2019re **hounding** her. This doesn\u2019t read as if you actually *love* your wife at all.\n\n>the conversation would move forward whenever she was ready to answer the simple question that I had asked her\n\nYou\u2019re really talking to your wife like she\u2019s some stupid kid that needs to be taught a lesson..\n\n>eventually, she said \u201cscrew you\u201d and started making herself\u2026.i chuckled to myself as I finished my food\n\nWow dude. Wow. \n\n>I couldn\u2019t believe how childish\u2026..I likened it to a kid breaking a window with a baseball bat and then saying \u201cdon\u2019t look at me\u201d while still holding the bat\n\nJust\u2026wow. Someone who truly loves their wife doesn\u2019t treat them like this. Making a huge giant deal because your wife had the *audacity* to speak to you as you were leaving. Nevermind that maybe she didn\u2019t even realize you were leaving the room at that exact moment. And even if she did? This is a stupid rule. Acting this petty and harping on your wife just because she talked to you as you were leaving the room. \n\n>I have decided that I am absolutely done coddling her enormous-sized ego\n\nLMAO the only person with an ego problem here is **you**.\nYou laid down the rule that your wife is only allowed to talk to you if you\u2019re in the same rule which is crazy to begin with, and double down being an AH to your wife because she *dared* not follow your rule. Laughing at her, ignoring her, berating her. \n\nTo me it sounds like she didn\u2019t answer your question because she *knew* what she did. She also knows your rule is bullshit, ridiculous, and probably feels like she can\u2019t voice that she feels that way *because of how you treat her and talk to her*.\n\nMy ex would laugh and me and say I was a child because I wouldn\u2019t talk to him/answer his \u201csimple\u201d questions just like how you did to your wife. The reason why I didn\u2019t? He had ridiculous rules, I **hated** him, and was only tolerating his bullshit until i could leave. You can\u2019t reason with someone who thinks as ridiculously as you, so why bother.", "ESH. \n\nYour way of talking about her is abhorrent and disgusting. If this is how you view her then it will seep into how you treat her and that\u2019s not a healthy way to treat someone. \n\nIf she is choosing to continue to speak to you when out of ear shot then that\u2019s on her or if she isn\u2019t retaining the info then maybe she needs her vit D levels checked. \n\nYou both sound toxic as hell", "just say YTA in your comment", "YES. Anytime I make food my my husband does we ALWAYS ask if the other person would like anything. Always.", "This is the poorest argument ever, I would still reply with why the f**k would you not offer to make your husband lunch if you are making it for yourself and you are both in the same house", "I don't think you understand. See, a future ex does this to me all the time. \n\nIf someone is told a million times that *they cannot be heard when they speak to their partner after their partner leaves the room*, they cannot claim to be accidentally doing it if they keep right on doing it with impunity.\n\nIf they keep doing it, it's because at best they simply do not give a fuck about the wishes of their partner. If they did, they wouldn't keep calling after their partner to make them come scurrying back to ask them to repeat themselves.", "If he gets a divorce without learning better skills, he will, for sure, ruin his next relationship attempt too. He can't just get away from this problem because the problem is him.", "This is the comment. When my husband and I were at our worst, he was convinced I was constantly trying to upset or antagonize him. I was convinced he was trying to get under my skin on purpose. We had lost sight of the \u201clove\u201d part of marriage and that\u2019s how petty shit like what\u2019s described above could become a whole thing for the day. \n\nSome conflict resolution work would do wonders for this couple indeed.", "I think he has who has the enormous ego wrong.", "This. I was leaning toward only slightly TA until I read the way OP described his Wife. I get irritated when having to repeat myself or shout from the other room to someone who is asking me a question. He should have asked her if she wanted pasta and waited for an answer before walking out of earshot. She could have also spoken louder to confirm she was heard knowing that he probably doesn't hear that well anymore and is kind of a prick.", "Also if you are both working from home would you not offer to make your wife lunch if you are also making lunch? It was obvious to me that that would be what she was asking for. Also it all depends on how quick you leave a room like if you stand up get to the door and say I\u2019m boiling pasta then walk out and her follow up was oh can you make me some would obviously have meant you had left the room. He doesn\u2019t sound like he likes his wife a whole lot to talk about her like this.", "Her not answering his questions reminds me of when my abusive ex would constantly berate me and I\u2019d shut down. And he laughs at her. I feel bad for his wife.", "> Should she admit that she was in the wrong for expecting you to hear and saying something when you asked that she not speak when you are leaving the room?  Sure.  Were you just as childish for making this be a \"lesson?\"  Yes.  \n\nEnacting reasonable consequences when people ignore reasonable requests isn't a childish lesson. That's just what happens if you treat people like that. If someone says \"I'm going to stop picking you up if you're late\" or \"I'm going to stop lending you my gym stuff if you don't clean it\", these are just boundaries that they're entitled to act on. \"I'm not going to keep coming back into the room when you're not paying attention to whether I can hear you\" is a reasonable boundary.\n\nCommunication is a mutual responsibility, so it's not reasonable to expect him to backtrack and ask her what she said every time, after he's already spoken up about this issue. He's done the responsible appropriate move by speaking up and suggesting a solution, which she's ignored. Why would a reasonable person need counselling to understand that if your partner is annoyed you keep doing something and asks you to stop then that's worth stopping? She shouldn't need outside help to figure out \"Hmm I could just get up and go to where he is to talk to him\".", "He wants to control her...", "All he asked was for her to speak to him before he leaves the room so he doesn\u2019t have to go back and ask her what she wanted to say. It\u2019s pretty simple. If you have to wait till someone leaves the room to ask them for a favor you\u2019re being a child. She\u2019s being a child. he\u2019s talked to her multiple times about doing that and she still does it and then she wants an apology? lol she\u2019s the AH.", "Wow that's easy. YTA Well not you. You have been helpful", "Because that's how AITA works unfortunately and there have been many such cases where one gender was TA and the other wasn't", "I understand perfectly well. One always has the option to address an ongoing problem like an adult instead of playing passive aggressive games.\n\n>a future ex does this to me all the time. \n\nConsidering that you refer to a partner as a future ex speaks volumes. Sheesh.", "Exactly what I was thinking! Just from the way he talks about her, someone he promised to love, cherish and RESPECT.", "He could easily also stop giving her \"instructions\" as if he were her boss. He's not, and continuing to act like he is will not help resolve this or any issue.", "go outside for a while.", "Nowhere does it say she wants an apology. OP is just projecting that onto her. You are also assuming she is purposefully waiting for him to leave the room. Maybe don't make so many assumptions.", "If someone asks you repeatedly to stop doing something over and over and you keep doing that something you\u2019re either dumb AF or doing it on purpose.", "There are so many reasons other than being dumb. If she was working she may have been so focused she didn\u2019t notice he was actually leaving the room that moment until he was already gone. \n\nHe's treating his wife like shes a petulant child and you're trying to grasp at reasons for why thats okay. It's not.", "There are a million reasons it keeps happening. Some of them are reasonable reasons and some of them are not and since we have no idea what those reasons are, you are just making shitty assumptions."]}
