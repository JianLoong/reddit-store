About 6 months ago I was made assistant manager and about 3 months ago, manager. While I was Assistant she started to lack the drive or compassion for the job she used to have, including not taking care of simple cleaning tasks to forgetting the big important things or refusing to come in when i needed her to. One of the days i was already in work and she came in mid day and starting griping about how some things weren\u2019t done (only because i had been very busy that day), which i then said and mentioned i would be getting to them soon. As she continued i asked her about all of the previous nights tasks and why they hadn\u2019t been done, in which she told me she forgot. she has worked here for about 2 years so the fact she is forgetting every night and for the past 3 months i find ridiculous. I asked her why she has forgotten these things every night for the past 3 months and she said, well it\u2019s not like they won\u2019t get done. (referring to me coming in the next day and doing them) in which it did make me a bit angry because she has been one to walk all over me in ways like this. I, angry decided to say \u201cif you do not start taking care of the assigned tasks that you have had, you will no longer have a job. i will find someone who will take care of them\u201d she gave me a stunned look and sighed while mumbling under her breath and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, which that was about a week ago, i just wanna know if i may had gone too far or if i could\u2019ve gone about it better. aita?", "created_utc": 1693856907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16a1ype/aita_for_telling_my_mil_she_would_no_longer_have/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She thinks that because youre her SIL she has the right to half ass the job with no repercussions because \"youre family\". She is taking advantage of your position and you did the right thing by full on stoping that shit right there. It takes a lot of B-A-L-L-Z to stand up to your MIL like that, so good for you bud", "NTA. So basically she is okay not doing her tasks for 3 months straight but gets mad when you did the same thing for 1 day not even on purpose either? She does like the same treatments then. However, she needs to keep family and work life separated. What happens at work should stay at work.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she's upset about you being promoted over her, especially since she's the one who helped you find the job to begin with. She's older than you and has been there longer and you've moved ahead while she hasn't. \n\nWhat she's doing is super passive-aggressive in leaving her work for you to do the next morning. She's not \"forgetting\", she's intentionally not doing it so you will have to. And I suspect she's forcing your hand so that you'll have to fire her, which will likely impact your family life.\n\nHave you talked to your partner (her child) about this at all?", "NTA. She'll have you doing her work until you stop it.", "NTA - MIL figures 1) She got you the job and 2) you are her DIL and that you owe her.  So she is just trying to take advantage of you in the end, figuring you wouldn't ever fire her.  But, the thing is that she is putting you into a tough situation now that you are her boss.  You could get fired yourself for nepotism.  Today, not tomorrow, fire her for insubordination and habitual failing at her job.  Don't hesitate, your job is in the line now and you are running out of time to correct this situation she has put you in.", "NTA. You probably could have been a little more proactive in handling this instead of reacting in the heat of the moment, but regardless expecting her to do her job is reasonable. I highly recommend anyone how is new to management read the askamanager.org site. It has soooo much helpful information on handling tricky situations like this. Because at some point this should probably be a formal conversation where y\u2019all work out the new dynamic of your situation and the expectations of her fulfilling her role are clear.", "If someone else was the manager (not a relative) she'd be fired already. NTA.", "Which Waffle House is this, so I can avoid it", "NTA. You're ultimately responsible. Her nose is out of joint over you being her boss now. Have a brief chat that perhaps she finds the situation awkward but that's life, her performance had dropped, you're held responsible, you need her to be team player. You won't do her job after she messes it up and you' won't favor her as that would be nepotism.  It's formal warning next time she doesn't do get job thoroughly. Probably a good time to prepare to recruit a new staff member if budget allows.", "GO talk to her outside of work -   \n\n\nIf she is near her fifties she may have some things starting to happen, my wife just said that lack of energy and forgetfulness can be a sign of something bigger, like early onset memory loss, that comes with hormonal imbalances, menopause (you ladies got it ROUGH!) or illness like diabetes etc. Go take care of your mother in law. She may need a daughter right now, not a boss.  \n\n\nBut at work you are the boss and you have certain things to accomplish - so NTA, but probably not the best one to be her direct supervisor.", "NTA, If she doesn't start performing her assigned task then fire her. She should be treated like any other employee. If your family complains tell them they can come in and do her work for her.", "ESH. Either she's envious because you got promoted and she didn't, and she's trying to sabotage you, or she's assuming she can swing the lead now she's related to the manager. But you've been manager for three months and you should have dealt with it *much* sooner.", "NTA. You did what you needed to do as a manager. In fact, I get the feeling if she weren't family, you would have had this talk with her long ago. If she had any of this attitude before you got promoted, that explains why you got promoted over her.\n\nIn any case, this shows why it can be problematic to work with family, especially to be in a position of authority over family.", "NTA - You need to provide honest feedback to your employees. However, I am actually a little more worried about the fact that you are managing your MIL. My guess is that your employer would not allow this if it was your spouse or child. MIL probably doesn't break the normal policy of not managing family, but I am concerned about your ability to manage her if you have let this go for three months. Is there any possibility that there is an option for one of you to change stores?", "Sounds like, in her mind she has family in management,  she is allowed to skate now. Nope, squash that now. She will keep pushing boundaries and slacking off more and more. Yet, if it ends up she is terminated,  she is going to cry favoritism or some such nonsense. \n\nNTA", "ESH.\n\nShe's still your MIL and unless she's a really shitty person, in my opinion she's a person you should treat with a certain respect. You could have phrased your warning much better and with more respect. That makes you TA. And this is the reason why this job situation with you being her boss is extremely problematic. **Being your parent's, aunt/uncle's/ MIL/FIL's BOSS is an absolute recipe for disaster** unless you have a SERIOUSLY good 100% healthy relationship which nearly no-one ever has.\n\nShe shouldn't abuse her situation that her boss is family to be lazy. That makes her TA.\n\nAnd you should BOTH, for the sake of you BOTH, end this situation and have her work somewhere else. This can be absolutely disastrous for family dynamics. I don't entirely understand how you both can be so naive about this. This makes you both TA.\n\nAnd she should be the one to change jobs for practical reasons, because you have the higher-earning, more difficult to obtain job.", "ESH\n\nShe should be doing her job.\n\nYou should not be in a position where you have that kind of power over her", "Could you imagine your Mil in law getting you a job and being passed over not once but twice by your daughter in law. Imagine how good and appreciated you would feel? Look at it from your Mil\u2018s position. I know you are just doing your job but at the same time your Mil got you the job and was passed over twice for you who just walked in the door", "https://www.askamanager.org/category/being-the-boss", "AH, no. Screwed, definitely. Good luck bruh", "This is why most companies dont allow family members to supervise other family. You are not the asshole. She is taking advantage. You did the right thing. Next offense write her up. My little brother worked under me and i fired him. She has to realize that work is separate from personal life. The lines cannot be blurred.  I worked at home depot and my brother became my department manager . I had to transfer departments because of company policy. I liked what i did so i had to transfer stores. You have to take a stand before your other employees look at it as favoritism. You are obviously good at your job since you got promoted fast. Dont let her ruin your chance at a good career . I would sit down with her and tell her that you appreciate that she gave you the opportunity at the job, but work and home are separate. If she cant understand that she isnt worth having as an employee.", "i have, but it\u2019s the same excuses to him, she forgets. and that\u2019s usually the end of it. we both think it\u2019s ridiculous but there\u2019s not much he can say or do to her, since she is his mother.", "i understand i should have, but it\u2019s not easy, especially when it\u2019s your MIL, i have asked her about it and kind of just tried to help her \u201cremember\u201d her tasks like sending messages or making little notes, i just held out hope that things would eventually get done.", "absolutely, this has been going on before i was even assistant, it has just gotten worse since i was promoted, and i\u2019ve tried to coax her into remembering her little things, or just to see an effort but she flat out will tell me she isn\u2019t doing something when i ask her too, i\u2019ve let it go for a while but i\u2019m jeopardizing my position now letting her get away with these things.", "i have tried to get her transferred to another store but none of the stores around us are able to, and management is not allowed to be transferred. I manage her because our previous manager stated that she was believed to be too irresponsible to handle the position. like i\u2019ve said to others i let it go for 3 months because ofc that\u2019s my mil\u2026 i left notes for her or sent her texts to help remind her hlding out hope she would do what i asked.", "i\u2019ve been here for about a year now, my previous manager said she did not want to make her assistant mgr because she was irresponsible. this is something that has been going on since before i was even assistant. it has just gotten worse since i\u2019ve become manager.", "The whole situation / dynamic is a recipe for disaster. You are in a psychological conflict between her being your \"elder\" and you being her boss. The only real solution is for her to change jobs. I'd talk with her about it.", "I\u2019m assuming you work at a chain. Have you considered talking to your regional manager about how they want this dealt with or having regional moderate solutions with the two of you. \n\nThis is a conflict of interest that they should have been prepared to manage so get their guidance."]}
