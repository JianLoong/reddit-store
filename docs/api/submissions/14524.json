I've always been more into fitness and taking care of my body, while my twin has struggled with obesity for most of his life. Recently, I've been posting pictures on my Instagram wearing nice suits and tight pants and showing off my body a bit. My twin has become increasingly jealous of this and has made several comments about it to me in private.\n\nThe other day, we had a family gathering and my twin blew up at me in front of everyone. He accused me of rubbing my body in his face and being insensitive to his struggles with weight. I was taken aback and tried to explain that I wasn't trying to hurt him, but he just kept getting more and more upset. Finally, I snapped and told him that he should stop eating so much and stop being lazy if he wants to have a better body like mine.\n\nNow, I feel terrible about what I said. I know my twin has a lot of issues with his weight and it wasn't fair of me to say those things. But at the same time, I feel like he's being unreasonable in his jealousy and I don't know how to handle the situation. He keeps complaining about his weight so when I snapped I felt like I needed to tell him the truth straight up so he could stop projecting his insecurities onto me. However, my (58F) mother is very upset at me, and cried after the family gathering to tell me how horrible I was for shaming my brother publicly. My family is also blowing up my phone with messages saying I should apologise to my brother, because he keeps telling everyone how upset he is. So, am I the asshole for what I said?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My obese twin is jealous of my Instagram posts showing off my body in suits and tie, he blew up at me at a family gathering, and I told him to stop eating so much and stop being lazy to get a better body.

That makes him the AH. I sympathise with his situation and feelings but what he's asking is wholly unreasonable. For that, he's the AH.\n\nAnd you didn't snap at him until he pushed and pushed.\n\nWhat you said was hurtful, of course, but I can't call you the AH for lashing out in reaction to his behaviour.\n\nThat it was in a public setting is because that's where he started on you.\n\nI understand your parents are upset for his hurt, but going along with his attempts to shame you for your body, and choosing to share some images you are proud of, is not the way to help your twin.\n\nThey need to find a way to help him that isn't at your expense.\n\nThat said, you can apologise for saying something that hurt him whilst also pointing out that he had hurt you himself first.", "NTA.\n\n\"Don't dish it if you can't take it.\"\n\nHe shouldn't blow up at you with the assumption that you won't snap back at him. You have no obligation to be sensitive towards some who lash at you out of jealousy. \n\nWhile non-identical twins are genetically just siblings, and therefore can have very diverse traits, it is in case of obesity pretty much entirely down to lifestyle. I'm sorry you all who blame genetics, there is no magical metabolism that makes you 150kg and your sister 50kg. Metabolism is a minor factor in the equation. \n\nObviously your brother doesn't feel right about his weight, and on any other case being mean to him would be unacceptable. But he went for you and you clawed back. That's on him.", "NTA The truth hurts sometimes. Doesn't mean you are wrong for saying it.", "It\u2019s not okay to body shame someone but I\u2019m going to go with NTA because he started this whole thing and escalated it by blowing up in a public setting around other people. Yes one may say that you should have had composure and not said anything because two wrongs don\u2019t make a right but realistically only a saint would keep quiet in a situation like that. I know I would\u2019ve blown had someone done that to me. You\u2019re not in the wrong. Your brother is. Unless he has some health problems preventing him from losing weight. Even so, he shouldn\u2019t be taking it out on you.

You have every right to be proud of how you look, and posting to Instagram should not be considered \"rubbing his face in it\".

Your twin was trying to body shame you and that is not okay.", "ESH\n\nBoth of you were unkind and lashed out, others already explained it. \n\nYour parents suck for not seekinh help for your brother sooner. If two children from the same parents generally eat the same stuff and only one of them ends up obese, I'd be very concerned for that childs health.\n\nMaybe he isn't active, because he has a hormonal imbalance making him feel tired, maybe his metabolism is out of whack, maybe he suffers from sleep apnea and that causes all sorts or problems. \n\nHe should see a doctor and a nutrionist. Not because being fat is inherently bad, but because it could be a symptom for something else. If there is nothing wrong with him physically, therapy might help to either find an alternative to food as coping strategy, accept his body or both.\n\nApologize for hurting him. Ask him to stop commenting on your body and you will not comment his again.", "ESH Your twin sucks for taking your Instagram pictures as a personal affront, and for blowing up in front of everyone. You suck for saying he needs to stop eating so much and stop being so lazy if he wants to look like you. Every fat person ever knows exactly what they look like, and why and berate themselves in their own heads about it. He did not need you to tell him this information. Telling him this is just being cruel and mean, it's not revealing crucial information.", "ESH. You shouldn't have to police your social media but if this is a life long issue do you really think it's laziness? There's a ton of medical factors you may not be privy to. He sucks because no one else is responsible for your mental health and social media is optional. You're not obligated to look at your brother's thirst traps. \n\nTo be blunt? You know you fucked up and are hoping it's okay because his behavior was also inappropriate. Two lefts don't make a right and two wrongs just mean everyone is wrong. I would apologize but specify it's for your comments and suggest if social media is this harmful to him he takes a break from looking at it because that's him controlling what he can. \n\nI am a former athlete (professional ballet dancer on the principal track) and now I am fat. I have at times conversations with my friend who has always been fat about our different perspectives on things. I don't think of myself as bad for fat because I didn't experience the same discrimination they have. Neither of us can get skinnier without sacrifices like our lives or health. I will actually die if I work out now. So we had to invest in our mental health to deal. The end result is I love my broken body. Nothing works. It's like your first car that breaks down every other mile on a good day. The thing is it got me this far. Some therapy helps but you're not able to deliver that message when you go for the things you know are vulnerable. He cannot hear you right now", "ESH - your twin bother and his approach to your pictures is creating tension and a rift between you both. Your blowing up was majorly stepping over a line. I'd say the best remedy for this is to seek a way to get him help and then be there to support him every step of the way.", "ESH You're not TA for your posts and living your best life, but you are TA for blaming your brother for being \"lazy\" and binge eating. Obesity is a big health issue, and usually there's more going on that's causing it. \n\nHonestly, people are in less control of what their natural body size is than most assume. Biologically, your body gives you a range of favorable weights, and within that range you can control a bit, but going outside that range on purpose without medical intervention is almost impossible. Even if weight is lost, it all comes back, and there's an immense amount of scientific research backing that up. \n\nOf course, your brother is also TA for accusing you like that at a family dinner. Your mom is defending him, wrongly, most likely due to worries over his mental health. But you are also her child and your mental health matters too. Certain types of people tend to always favor whoever is doing the worst at the moment and your mom seems like one of these people. \n\nI hope that you all are able to set new boundaries and move past this incident together. Good luck my dude", "ESH\n\nFirst things first, your extended family should mind their own business and leave it to your mother to lay down the law.\n\nSecond, you need to apologize to your brother.\n\nThird, your brother owes you an apology.

Also, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve done this already or how he would respond, but maybe invite him to join you at the gym(if he says yes remember that you\u2019re in much better shape than he is and don\u2019t go super hard).", "[removed]", "ESH.

You are never responsible for another person's feelings.
