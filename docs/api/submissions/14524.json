I've always been more into fitness and taking care of my body, while my twin has struggled with obesity for most of his life.

My twin has become increasingly jealous of this and has made several comments about it to me in private.\n\nThe other day, we had a family gathering and my twin blew up at me in front of everyone.

Finally, I snapped and told him that he should stop eating so much and stop being lazy if he wants to have a better body like mine.\n\nNow, I feel terrible about what I said. I know my twin has a lot of issues with his weight and it wasn't fair of me to say those things. But at the same time, I feel like he's being unreasonable in his jealousy and I don't know how to handle the situation. He keeps complaining about his weight so when I snapped I felt like I needed to tell him the truth straight up so he could stop projecting his insecurities onto me. However, my (58F) mother is very upset at me, and cried after the family gathering to tell me how horrible I was for shaming my brother publicly.

I didn\u2019t want to disappoint them and I guess part of me was afraid they laugh at the fat girl.  After a couple months they caught on. So my kids that had always been athlete and active and trim.
