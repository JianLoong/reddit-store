The way you used your words while giving advice is beautifully said. \n\nIn addition, if I had a husband and I was pregnant in a situation where we have to choose which life to save, it would be me regardless of how far along I am because my husband AND my family would need me more than the baby. While I agree with you to advise her to talk with her husband rather he's okay with losing her and keeping the baby, I personally would tell him to choose me without a discussion because I also got a family.

Being so blunt was likely very upsetting.  I see where you're coming from though,  you're worried about her. \n\nYour friend and her husband need to see a perinatologist, also called a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.

She\u2019s in a horrible situation and I can\u2019t imagine how hard this must be for her, but she asked you for your opinion.

Mothers can have more babies, babies can\u2019t grow another mother. \n\nYTA for the last bit about husband being a widow - that was unnecessarily cruel.", "YTA. With that delivery, you don't sound like a very good friend.", "YTA. Baby. It\u2019s a baby.", "I'm a specialist women's therapist, working around pregnancy and related issues.\n\nBy 18 weeks, your friend may be able to feel movement. They may know the sex. They may have a name that they refer to it by. They sound like they have probably made plans and dreamed dreams. It sounds like this may not be a _fetus_ to them, but a _baby_. Try and listen to their language. You've called it a fetus the whole way through here, what language is your friend using? It's respectful to use the same language as the person carrying is using. If they consider this a \"fetus\", that's all good; if they consider this a baby, then I do recommend you do the same. \n\nI understand that to _you_ that this is a bunch of cells and a medical problem, but to your friend, she may consider this her _child_. It is the equivalent, in my professional opinion, of the people that refuse to refer to trans people by their correct gender. That fetus' identity is now \"baby\" according to the person carrying it and that's how you should think of it too. \n\n40% is not a bad chance of survival. If she considers this her baby, her child, then I can understand taking that risk. Many people have children that go onto chemotherapy based on a less than 40% chance of survival. \n\nThere are also probably other options. Things like a coagulant and a controlled caesarian possibly? I'm definitely not a doctor, but unless she's never able to have an operation, there are probably options available to her.\n\nSoftly, YTA. Not for your specific advice, that's your opinion and she asked for it. But if your friend thinks of this as a baby and you are refusing to view it the same way, then that's really disrespectful and unempathetic to your friend. If we were talking about an illness for their toddler that had a 60% chance of fatality, would you recommend just ending the toddlers life instead? Would you be this callous to their grief? If your friend considers this a baby, then that's essentially what you've done. That's not being a great friend. \n\nIf your friend considers it a fetus, then my entire verdict/opinion will change.", "YTA.  While you may value her life over that of her unborn baby, she obviously does not.  For some women, bringing a child into this world will be their greatest achievement, and many would willing sacrifice their own lives to do so.  As for your assertion that her fetus is not a person, that is strictly your opinion.  There are a great many people who disagree with you, and she may be one of those.  For you to so casually dismiss her baby that she is willing to do so much for as nothing?  Yeah.  YTA.", "YTA - You were fine to answer the life of the mother is above the fetus but you were awful to speak of him raising a newborn as a widower.  Nobody needs that kind of talk during the most miserable month of their lives.  Apologize regardless of their decision.  You blew it big time.  Just mean and harsh when she needed kindness the most.", "You shouldn\u2019t have said that last part to her.

Op isn't an ah for stating their opinion, but the delivery needed a little more tact. She has different opinion about her what is going to become her child that you don't.

Reality can be painful, but it remains the truth.", "I didn't rub it in her face. It was not my intention. She didn't really take the time to think about what it meant if she had complications.

What's the thought process behind the medication? You said she needs to take it to live, but refuses to because it could hurt the baby. Does she not realize that if she dies from not taking the meds, the baby dies too?", "I think OP went this way though because reading other comments, the other people in mamas life are telling her it\u2019s all roses and are not presenting her the facts.

And why she was discussing this decision with you, rather than her husband, is mind-boggling to me.  I'm a pretty blunt person, but even I wouldn't push hard on her to abort.
