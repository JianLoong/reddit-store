It might be a *bit* of privilege to call in 13 different license plates instead of just the one in your spot, knowing each owner will have to pay hundreds to get their car back, even though they're a 100% wrong.

I owned a condo with one covered space that I purchased with the condo (each condo had one). There were signs posted everywhere that spots were reserved and there happened to be one directly over my spot.\n\nI lived there 10 years. For the first year, I used to leave polite notes reminding people the spot was mine. Usually different cars each time, but a few repeat offenders. My spot was occupied by other cars at least once a week that first year. Once I started calling the tow truck, it magically stopped!!

That would be some long chat to have at late pm and with a small baby to care for, who certainly was tired and cranky and that point.

In my state, it\u2019s a misdemeanor, fine (200 bucks) and community service (5 hours), and the car is towed. \n\nA lot of the towing companies in my area in particular document the illegal parking and notify the cops if they hadn\u2019t been notified already to stay in or get into their good graces and get more towing calls from them.", "It\u2019s even funnier cause the implication would then be that the only people parking illegally aren\u2019t white. It\u2019s like that lady on the talk show that asked who was going to clean toilets and other \u201clesser\u201d jobs if all the Mexicans were deported.", "I absolutely HATE when people throw around the racism accusations. I've been subject to racism and for someone to equate THIS to racism?? They use it to just wave in anyone's face to cover up the fact that they are cockroaches of society parking illegally and in handicapped spaces? It 100% waters down when people genuinely are victims of racism. It makes us afraid of being seen as the same as these clowns who are trigger-happy about that word. I hope they all got their cars towed.", "have you never seen a prius?", "Eh as someone who has lived in a complex with limited parking I'm not shocked at the number.
