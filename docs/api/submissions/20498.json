Anyone with a license knows you don't park where you can be towed. I'm guessing it's posted. Sounds like no one has enforced it in a while.

Example, they leave their bags of trash outside their apartment doors for days (we don\u2019t have trash service to take it for us), don\u2019t pickup their dogs poop, there\u2019s one building in general that just lets their kids throw trash out the door and off the balcony into the common area (property management doesn\u2019t have proof of who\u2019s throwing it so they can\u2019t punish them properly). Also I talked to one of my neighbors who lives in the same building as me to make sure it wasn\u2019t any of their friends and they agreed it\u2019s a problem and we\u2019re pissed off by it too and told me to call (he is not white if that matters to you).", "Especially if she was parked in a handicapped spot.
