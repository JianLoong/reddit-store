Think if she is high and decides to use the stove? She could potentially burn the house down. She also could attract thieves or dangerous people to your home. It\u2019s not hyperbolic to suggest that having her there could put your family in very real danger. \n\nStacy is not going to get any better or change her ways if you continue to let her live there. She needs an incentive to change, having your house to live in is allowing her to avoid changing.", "NTA\n\nAddicts will drain you of everything you own and then will destroy everything.  It is awful and sad, but it is just a fact.  If she was actively trying to be clean it's a different story.

If you do end up staying with your wife, be prepared for many more things like this. I'd pay attention to the finances because I'm sure your wife will funnel her money. She's a massive enabler that would benefit from Al Anon. Good luck.", "I completely understand your frustration. Living with roaches can be a nightmare and it's important to maintain cleanliness to prevent infestations. It seems like you have tried your best to address the issue and communicate with your SIL about the importance of cleanliness, but she hasn't been receptive. It's unfortunate that it has come to this point, but sometimes tough decisions need to be made in order to protect your living environment.", "Maybe you should watch the tv show \u201cfour good days\u201d starring mila kunis and perhaps look into a local alanon meeting \n\n\u201c\u201ds there a difference between AA and Al-Anon?\n\nWhereas members of AA talk about being powerless over alcohol, members of Al- Anon talk about being powerless over the alcoholic and the decisions they make.

That's f\\*\\*\\*ing gross.", "NTA, she is out of control and the roaches are gross. \n\nIncidentally depending on where you live you can get a subscription where the exterminator will come by every quarter and spray outside the house (or inside if needed), at $140.00 per quarter.  Last year we had a wasp nest in the front yard hidden in a rockery and they were ok coming by 4 times until they were all gone, as it was under the subscription warranty.", "NTA. OP, install security camera around your home and lock up your valuables. I would honestly be tempted to offer her money, or something she wants, to get her out sooner, but if she won't take it, go through the formal eviction process. I would either lock up all the food and pots and pans in your home, or hide everything and just eat out until she's gone. If she can't eat at your place, it should make it harder for her to destroy it. And tell your wife she can also work to help find her other places to go, but that's her responsibility.", "NTA. What a terrible situation you've found yourself in. I'd say the roaches are just one of many causes. Best wishes getting out and moving forward with your life, roach-free!", "Or she could resort to thievery herself to pay for her addiction \ud83d\ude1f", "NTA. I think you handled this as well as you could have under the circumstances. Time for Stacy and the roaches to go. I don't believe that your wife has a leg to stand on in having her sister stay because it doesn't seem as if she was even going behind Stacy to keep the home picked up. She was fully enabling her and it needed to stop.", "NTA because I would probably feel the same. But I have to point out that you can leave food out all day if you don\u2019t have roaches. You have roaches. Your exterminator company hasn\u2019t found the nest yet. That\u2019s their problem. It\u2019s not Stacey\u2019s problem. When you pack up the food, the roaches are still there\u2026 they are just hiding in dark spaces.", "Kicking her ass to the street maybe the rock bottom she needs to get straight. If she got food and a warm bed with no worries she wouldn't have the incentive to sober up. She may never wanna sober up not everyone does but not having anything tends to help open her eyes. And the roaches  I don't know how you're doing it  I would burn everything they skeeve me oit so bad.", "Nta. Pour bleach down the sink and drains after your sister in law leaves. Start with daily, taper off to once a week. Roaches may hide and lay eggs in drains so if you keep having recurring infestations that could be part of it. Baking soda either dry or mixed with water is also good, and it should be safe to use in combo with the bleach. Or instead if you don't like how bleach smells.", "The two sisters belong to the street.  NTA", "You can't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You put up with the for 5 months longer than I would have. \n\nIf Stacy leaves, I still don't know if your marriage will survive this. Your wife betrayed you IMO. She probably thinks you betrayed her, but you're right that she's an enabler and it's super wrong of her to put her sister's wants and needs above your own. Especially when it comes to something as disgusting and unhygienic as roaches all over your food and home.", "He said the roaches moved in with Stacey, which mean she brought them with her belongings, so it is a Stacey problem. And roaches multiply faster when food is available to eat.\n\nNTA"]}
