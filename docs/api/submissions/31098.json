Think if she is high and decides to use the stove? She could potentially burn the house down. She also could attract thieves or dangerous people to your home. It\u2019s not hyperbolic to suggest that having her there could put your family in very real danger. \n\nStacy is not going to get any better or change her ways if you continue to let her live there. She needs an incentive to change, having your house to live in is allowing her to avoid changing.", "NTA\n\nAddicts will drain you of everything you own and then will destroy everything.  It is awful and sad, but it is just a fact.  If she was actively trying to be clean it's a different story.  She is not, she is using, your wife sees it too or she would have accepted the divorce.  \n\nGood luck OP.  No one wins with addiction.", "NTA. If you do end up staying with your wife, be prepared for many more things like this. I'd pay attention to the finances because I'm sure your wife will funnel her money. She's a massive enabler that would benefit from Al Anon. Good luck.", "I completely understand your frustration. Living with roaches can be a nightmare and it's important to maintain cleanliness to prevent infestations. It seems like you have tried your best to address the issue and communicate with your SIL about the importance of cleanliness, but she hasn't been receptive. It's unfortunate that it has come to this point, but sometimes tough decisions need to be made in order to protect your living environment.", "Maybe you should watch the tv show \u201cfour good days\u201d starring mila kunis and perhaps look into a local alanon meeting \n\n\u201c\u201ds there a difference between AA and Al-Anon?\n\nWhereas members of AA talk about being powerless over alcohol, members of Al- Anon talk about being powerless over the alcoholic and the decisions they make.

Last year we had a wasp nest in the front yard hidden in a rockery and they were ok coming by 4 times until they were all gone, as it was under the subscription warranty.", "NTA. OP, install security camera around your home and lock up your valuables. I would honestly be tempted to offer her money, or something she wants, to get her out sooner, but if she won't take it, go through the formal eviction process. I would either lock up all the food and pots and pans in your home, or hide everything and just eat out until she's gone. If she can't eat at your place, it should make it harder for her to destroy it. And tell your wife she can also work to help find her other places to go, but that's her responsibility.", "NTA. What a terrible situation you've found yourself in. I'd say the roaches are just one of many causes. Best wishes getting out and moving forward with your life, roach-free!", "Or she could resort to thievery herself to pay for her addiction \ud83d\ude1f"]}
