That might not be the entire family's view though. \n\nA suggestion if there are few people that you think deserve to know, even if you are no longer going to have a contact - send them a Holiday postcard with photos of you and your wife, happy, maybe from your wedding.

Many people who did not grow up in dysfunctional families have a great deal of difficulty believing others had truly horrible parents.

If you weren't comfortable doing that, then I would ask why you're bothering to have continued contact at all.\n\nYou've been subjected to judgment your whole life, so I won't lay more on you, but if you are uncertain about leaving room in your life for your family, I would recommend asking your wife whether she sees any benefit in it. She knows better than we do.", "I don't think it was a great decision, but NTA. I get you didn't want them to flip out, but it's hard to keep contact with them and keep a whole marriage secret. So you must have realized that at some point they'd find out (you can't spend your whole life without them finding out).

Maybe with proper prepping and timing one or two of them would have come around and seen it your way. That doesn't mean what you did makes you an AH. Also, \"the filthiest ah\"? Who talks like that? Maybe even if they were accepting you dodged a bullet (joke). You brother is angry. People say things they don't mean. (or sometimes things they mean at the time, but after they calm down maybe they don't anymore). No excuse for it though. If he does ever come around, only you can decide if you will forgive him. Again, you wouldn't be an ah if you didn't. Did you actually speak to any other family members?

Doing this could have probably saved some level of drama and stress as everything is clear and out in the open. It's not really a secret one can hold forever anyways. \n\nHowever if your entire family is this judgemental and hateful about both your ambitions amd sexuality, there's no saving that relationship, no matter when you would tell them.\n\nStill, very sorry to hear about how poorly you've been treated by your famoly.

I have to wonder why this matters as you were already estranged from your family. You knew they wouldn't approve, and it doesn't seem like you cared about their approval. So why do you think you are wrong for not sharing something with people you no longer have a relationship with? You know your family does not value you as a person or a member of their family, and you need to be okay with that.
