I may be TA because my hiding this fact may have exacerbated the situation by breaking their trust.

They\u2019re upset because they couldn\u2019t repudiate you earlier with vile and hateful words.\n\nYou made the right call by distancing yourself from your family. They don\u2019t sound like the type to set aside decades of misogynistic indoctrination because they choose to love and accept you unconditionally. And that is their loss.", "NTA - Why would you or your wife ever want to have that in your life?

Hope that the friend of a friend reports back to family. That'll show 'em. NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhy on earth would you *owe* them opportunities to increase the efficiency of their bigotry? If they want someone to streamline their hate-workflows, they can pay a consultant. \n\nIf your wife truly doesn\u2019t get it and keeps harping on about what you should have done differently, you might need to find a good therapist to help explain things to her.", "NTA you are no contact now, I don\u2019t understand why your wife is continuing to beat a dead horse. You did what you thought was right at the time and she should understand it is your family experience.", "NTA. You can't win with people like that.", "NTA --- I hope that when your brother rang you and started calling you names you laughed at him before hanging up in his ear.", "I agree with you, sometimes you have to cut off old wounds. For your mental health, they do not need to know. \n\nNow on the other hand, your wife feels the need to connect to them, that's a natural urge to try and make connections and feel included. You of course know that with your families Zealot background, acceptance is not within their grasp at this time. \n\nYou have saved your Wife a boat load of pain and emotional manipulations. She might feel that she lost something, but it's a part that is rotten.\n\nReligious zealots in all forms are not tolerant of others, I think you did the right thing. \n\nHowever, your Wife doesn't seem too happy with this action, I say give her the phone and contact numbers, let her send out those Christmas cards", "I think the real question here is why do you care at all? You were already at bare minimum contact, and let's say you did come out earlier and somehow they didn't cut you off. What kind of relationship can you even envisage? Makes no sense at all.\n\nNTA for not telling them, but it's odd that your wife thinks anything positive could have come out of coming out to them at all at any stage... unless she may enjoy the drama?\n\nYour brother is only upset you didn't tell them earlier because they were on the backfoot when someone else broke the news to them. Had you told them prior, that would give them the upper hand in controlling the narrative to everyone - vilify you to soften the blowback on them. As it stands, them not knowing about you being gay and married before others made them look ignorant and incapable to control their brood so-to-speak.", "NTA they are bigots and would have likely had the same reaction if you told them beforehand. I would try to block them all and not give them another thought. I\u2019m sorry your family is that way. Also, congratulations on getting married!", "I'm gonna go with NTA here, yeah.  I think avoiding contact with them is absolutely the right call.", "NTA. Telling your family would not have saved your relationship with them. Instead enjoy just enjoy being with you disowned and not having to deal with such people", "NTA. Your instincts were 100% correct. I'm sorry you came from such lousy egg and sperm donors. Enjoy your life with your wife and a life that is filled with love, not hate.", "NTA\nIts your marriage. Tell who you want. But at the same time.... Maybe YTA for cutting contact?? But that's provisional because I don't know your family\nI'm going to preface this by saying that I am not judging your choices in anyway. But I'm one of those conservative Christians. Now if rather have a relationship with my son even if he was gay, while I'd still disagree with his choices.... Id still want to be in his life.\nEdit :\nFor Conservative religious beliefs, it usually only applies to adherents of the religion..\nFor sure that's the case in Christianity", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
