Lots of families have first names that are common among them.  And they do exactly what your ILs are doing - they give them different nicknames.  You need to let this go.  You have no say in what they name their kid and there is no reason to create drama.\n\nYTA", "If you're here to disagree with the people saying YTA, why post in the first place? Don't post if you're already convinced you're right! :D", "It's not bizarre at all. Family names are quite common, and well it's not like you named your kid something unusual. Robert is VERY VERY common.", "Until my Dad every male for generations in my dads family was John *middle name* surname. They all went by their middle name. Tracing my family tree is pretty much impossible", "Just pointing out that having the same middle name is quite a different scenario to the same first name (except in cultures that go by the middle name in which case the importance just swaps around). \n\nIf they share a last name then it's going to be a bit of a debacle for the kids, especially in adulthood with various legal registrations etc. Slightly different if it's different last names though. The kids might decide to go by their full name or a different variation as well, so the nickname differentiation will really only hold for certain whilst they're young.\n\nOP has (weirdly) said in another comment that they haven't actually forbidden them from calling their kid Robert, so I'm going NAH (but I still wouldn't call my kid the same name as his cousin, I'd want him to have his own identity).", "But you were the first one to choose to name a child after someone else\u2026", "Obviously you're not Italian or Mexican because it's very common. I have uncles, cousins, and nephews all with the same name.", "literally who gives a shit! You all are freaking out about nothing. YTA", "no it's not", "You never actually told them what? I call bs. \n\nPrevious post you provided under the MOD \"What action I took 1. Told the in-laws under no circumstances will they name their child the same name as ours. \"\nIt's one thing to find it odd, it's another to get this much in a twist over it. Get over it. YTA", "My family like 4 Carlos, 3 Hectors, 4 Carmens, and the list goes on I share my name with my cousing, and my middle name with another cousing LOL nobody cares.", "Yeah I mean if I had an ex wife and she didn't want me to use a name, or some coworker or something I wouldn't care. A sibling is just different tho. Even a cousin wouldn't be too big of a deal siblings just too close.", "Is that why your sibling wants to name their child Robert too?", "So they wanted to use a family name too. Not so strange. And they are using a different nickname", "ummm... Ok. YTA. Your *sister* also wants to name her son after y'all's *father* and is calling him something completely different. \n\nThat's not weird at all. \n\nYou're gatekeeping a family name and stirring up a problem that doesn't need to exist. And if your wife says anything, shut that shit right down because your sister has just as much right to have her child after her father as you do.  I'll say it again, YTA", "It might be strange if Robert wasn't a family name, but it is. This happens all the time, it's really not uncommon for cousins to have the same name if it's important in the family. \n\nWhat did it mean for you to name your son Robert? If it's meaningful, maybe consider that it is for your sister, too.", "Fairly confident considering it was never on their top 3 until recently", "It consumes my entire existence", "Hey they\u2019re free to name their child. Just think it\u2019s weird. We haven\u2019t told them they couldn\u2019t.", "Same with my husband\u2019s family! Firstborn sons are all John with a different middle name. His ex refused though my son is the next generation of John. Apparently the OP doesn\u2019t know any Italian families cause the majority share names", "My husband's family goes a little lighter on that, but every single first born son is named Brendan across all the uncles and all the grandpas going up as far as you can trace it. They also go by nicknames and middle names.", "Yep I think it\u2019s weird. They\u2019re free to use it.\n\nDad was happy with the ode", "Hey you don\u2019t have to believe me , all good", "My ex-husband was named after his grandfather, and then his stepmoms dad also had the same name. It was confusing and I hated it, personally.", "Said they just liked \u201cRob\u201d", "Naming **all** the grandchildren after the same relative is indeed strange. Especially when the kids are like a year apart and within the immediate family.\n\nHow the fuck do you people not see that as strange? Basic damn etiquette to not give your child the same name as your sister's. This isn't rocket science.", "I mean she only said she liked \u201cRob\u201d the same way we liked Bobby. Just happened to work out with dads name. No indication it was after dad", "Unless you\u2019re psychic, you can\u2019t see in the future. Sounds to me like you\u2019ll push your kid to change his name so you\u2019ll be \u201cright\u201d and vindicated", "Kinda loving this for you! (I do so hope this is well placed sarcasm, but you never know on this Al Gore\u2019s internet). It\u2019s a journey, man. But sleep deprivation will take care of it in no time; let biology run its course and your own baby\u2019s all-consuming needs will burn away all other concerns. Do your job, Bobby!", "You really need to find something else to worry about.   Try to find the good things in life to fixate upon and let the annoyances roll off.  You'll be much happier", "Well you did admit you feel like you\u2019re losing your mind so maybe it\u2019s time to seek help for that. You really can\u2019t do anything to stop them that wouldn\u2019t make you an AH.", "This comment was funny as hell and I encourage others to appreciate the heavy self deprecating sarcasm here", "Then that says more about you than them", "That's pretty scary! Maybe see a doctor.", "So it\u2019s only okay when you make your father happy\u2026\nYou\u2019re making this about you and your son when honestly it\u2019s not about you or your child, your child might be the first thing that springs your mind but not your sisters or her husbands and I\u2019m sorry but if you don\u2019t like the weirdness then why don\u2019t you go change your child\u2019s name seeing as that\u2019s your only option other than to shut up and get over it", "LOL  it does get confusing, but then we just add the parent name and the kid name.", "And that\u2019s enough reason to make their kid what they want. You think your kid won\u2019t meet others with the same name?", "Because it's common in my family - and we've never gotten our family members confused, so there's no problem.", "YTA. she can name her child whatever she  likes. She\u2019s not doing it for spite, she\u2019s planning to use a different nickname. AND IT'S YOUR DAD'S NAME. She doesn't have to explain why she likes the name. \n\nI don't understand why you think it's \"weird\". And if it's a super common name, even less so.\n\nI guess the real question is what exactly is word about it? Or why does this actually bother you?

It\u2019s weird you think YOU do", "I\u2019ll add the /s for ya next time", "\ud83c\udfe1", "You can say it\u2019s sarcasm all you want but if you truly didn\u2019t care you wouldn\u2019t of come here would you\u2026", "lmao what does this even mean"]}
