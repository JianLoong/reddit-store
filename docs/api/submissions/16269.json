It\u2019s your life. But obviously you should have expected the reaction as families of all cultures love to be involved in that big day. Don\u2019t act so surprised!", "NTA:  My wife agreed after we had a church wedding that 5:00 at the county courthouse would have been a better option for us personally.  The big event was mainly for the parents truth be told.\n\nYou had the ceremony that you wanted.  Your MIL will hopefully get over it eventually.", "NAH\n\nYou do you. \n\nBut yeah a parent might be upset to miss and not even know about their child's wedding.  Fair enough.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding, not anyone else\u2019s. Also, I may be a bit biased because this is exactly how my husband and I got married.", "NTA but how did you get a wedding license that quickly?", "NTA, no one's business, your husband is not an AH either. If his parents want to pay for a huge party, they can go ahead and do it, that is their business. Not OP's or OP's husband.\n\nNTA in any way. Never feel remorse for being prudent and sane. MIL sounds exhausting.", "NTA but he is for knowing that about his mom and doing that to her anyway", "NTA. It\u2019s your decision and your wedding. I went to vegas with my fianc\u00e9 once and my mother in law threatened me saying if we got married out there she\u2019d never ever forgive us \u2026.

You are both adults and can get married when and how you please.", "NTA\n\nMy husband and I were both on rocky terms with family, and had zero interest telling them. His parents know. My mother has no idea, and she probably never will.  We did a Zoom wedding. Done, didn't even have to put on pants with a belt!", "NTA. While I typically embrace and honor family traditions, ultimately this is the one thing that is solely between the two of you.  I'm sorry that you have gotten negative feedback from some family members, but over time I hope they come around and get over it.  From your description it sounds like you're not traditionalist anyhow, and families are far away, so this really was a practical, down to earth, and very YOU way to do it.  Good luck to you!", "I was typing out N T A but think I'll change to NAH.  I think ultimately, weddings are for the couple.  So as long as you got what you wanted you did the right thing.  Family (moms especially) are allowed to feel disappointed they couldn't celebrate with you.  BUT my vote changes to strong N T A if they continue trying to make you feel bad or continue pushing for an extra ceremony or reception that you don't want.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s no one\u2019s business but yours and your partner\u2019s (and now the state, because that\u2019s what marriage is: inviting the state into your relationship). This is how weddings should be (if they are at all). Big, expensive parties that do nothing but create drama are stupid and I can\u2019t wait until Gen-Z kills the last dumb custom that the Millennials missed.", "WOOHOO to you, and congrats!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.

Because I mean it\u2019s totally your choice, so in that sense, NTA. But if it were me, I would want to start things off on a good note with my in-laws, so if I knew it meant a lot to them culturally, I would definitely tell them and have a post-wedding celebration. \n\nHonestly sometimes weddings are more for the parents than the people getting married. You can do it your way then do it their way and everyone wins.", "If anyone is the AH, it's probably your husband.  Presumably, he knows his mother well, and knew she would probably be upset.  Did he mention this to you?  How did you respond?\n\nIf you two did this knowing it would upset one or both families, then mild YTA.  In the end, it's your life, but attempting to be considerate of family members is worthwhile.", "NAH. Eloping, by its very definition, is socially deviant, and an act of self-interest at the expense of others. It is assumed you know this and are prepared to deal with the social consequneces.", "NAH\n\nNothing wrong with putting your own preferences before others. If the both of you had cared about the parents\u2019 feelings, you would have considered their thoughts and convinced them to align with your wishes, or much less told them about the two of you getting married. But, if don\u2019t want their emotional baggage, then you are free to ignore them. It really depends on you and your partner\u2019s relationship with them and how you want it to be. So, the AITA post is not a question for others but whether you feel like TA.\n\nCongrats on your marriage.", "NAH.\n\nI can see all the sides, but weddings and the parties that surround them are ESSPENSIVE \ud83d\ude2b If someone wants my ceremony to be bigger than I planned, they better foot the bill!", "NTA!!

People are making very uncharitable assumptions about your in-laws but you didn't actually provide any information to say they did or said anything unreasonable (except express disappointment, which is totally normal and okay as long as they aren't being super dramatic and making it about them), I think it's an understandable reaction to be disappointed, and they probably just wanted to be able to celebrate when the wedding itself happened!

We don't know them enough to judge his action. As an adult, what he did is simply not considerate. OP should take this as a warning and find out reasons behind his action.\n\nMaybe he is very oblivious to people's feeling, maybe he rebelled against his tradition out of spite, or maybe the this has been a ongoing issue with MIL and/or the family.\n\nIt could give OP more insights into the person and the family that she married.", ">As an adult, what he did is simply not considerate. \n\nHe did what was best for him and his partner. That's *not* inconsiderate. \n\nHe doesn't owe his mother the wedding of her dreams. He doesn't even owe it to her for her to be there at his elopement. He probably knew she would throw a huge hissy fit, and chose to tell her after-the-fact to avoid months of harassment and guilt-tripping and pressure to have a big wedding that the couple definitely did not want."]}
