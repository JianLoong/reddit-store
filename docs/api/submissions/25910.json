My husband's parents did not like this and asked me if I would allow them to facilitate contact between their grandchildren. I said of course. So they had a family BBQ and the older kids were there and my MIL came to pick up my kids. They did three of those kinds of family gatherings so the kids would see each other but the last two times my kids were not happy and the last time my kids were miserable coming back because their siblings made it clear they did not want to be around them and they heard the older kids arguing with their grandparents over them and saying they weren't even their siblings.\n\nMy kids said they really didn't like going and so I decided, for my kids sake, that would be it.

If the grandparents want a relationship they can have one on your terms that do not make your children miserable.", "Yeah, NAH.\n\nTeenagers are not in the most compassionate headspace. Younger kids can\u2019t understand being rejected like that. \n\nBasically no one is set up for success here. You\u2019re not going to ask your kids to accept being treated poorly. The teens are not going to pull their shit together and be kind to the little kids. \n\nYou gave it a shot, but you can\u2019t let your kids learn that they aren\u2019t worthwhile, which they will if they feel like their constantly being rejected by \u201cfamily\u201d. Tell your in-laws you appreciate what they are trying to do, but you\u2019ll try it again in a few years when everyone has grown up a bit more and has a better shot at working through it.", "NAH", "NTA, and tell your IL that the asshole here is the ex wife. She groomed in her kids their rejection to their siblings, so if they want to be mad with someone, it should be her and I would even say her kids too. Even when you are entitled to feel whatever you want, they are still jerks.", "A lot of people describe selfish scenarios, but you aren\u2019t. You\u2019re describing a situation where your children are telling you very specific things other people are saying and doing that are making them uncomfortable. This is the definition of a reason to not force your kids to go as long as their semi-estranged siblings are going to be there. \n\nYour MIL probably has this nobly idea of mending relations for their son and bringing all of his kids together. That\u2019s great, IF the kids are all willing to participate. When one or more of the kids decides to be spoiled brats \u2014 no matter their age \u2014 there\u2019s less and less that can be done as they get older and especially once they\u2019re adults. Let your MIL know that you and your children value their relationship with her, and the rest of your husband\u2019s family, but that your children have had it with being treated poorly by their their older siblings. I\u2019d even phrase it like that. Instead of half\u2019s or from his first marriage, just call them the older siblings. \n\nPoint out that they\u2019re old enough to behave better and aren\u2019t and that if they\u2019re going to be at a gathering, party, or event of any size your kids won\u2019t be attending until their older siblings can behave better. In this way you\u2019re not denying her or the rest of the family access, you\u2019re not saying they can never be in the same place. You\u2019re setting definable terms on the separation from their older siblings and it\u2019s something they can fully control and even agree to. Will you be nice to your younger siblings? Yes, great, no, too bad. From that point on, any family gatherings that include your husband\u2019s kids from his first wife are choosing to exclude his children with you, and I\u2019d have a conversation with any other available family members about this as well. All of your husband\u2019s children deserve to be treated with respect, not just some of them.", "INFO \n\nDid they know your kids weren't coming, or were they thinking they were coming and waiting around for them to show?", "NTA protect your kids. I laws mean well, but they are pushing everyone.", "NTA.  I can understand your ILs wanting the kids to have a relationship but it's not happening and it's making YOUR kids miserable.  I'd lower the boom.  They can visit your ILs ONLY when the other kids are not present and I would check to make sure they are honoring that boundary.", "NTA your children don't need to be around people, or other kids, that don't want to be around them.", "Yep. I bet MIL\u2019s idea of bonding is making them babysit and entertain the younger siblings- it will just increase their resentment"]}
