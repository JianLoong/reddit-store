They had been divorced officially for 7 months at the time but had been separated for close to 2 years at that point. She did not like me despite being remarried herself at the time.

My stepkids said they would not come over to see their younger siblings and didn't have an interest in the relationship. They also did not want any contact with me, which didn't surprise me because of how they felt about me before my husband died, but it still hurt. My husband's parents did not like this and asked me if I would allow them to facilitate contact between their grandchildren. I said of course. So they had a family BBQ and the older kids were there and my MIL came to pick up my kids. They did three of those kinds of family gatherings so the kids would see each other but the last two times my kids were not happy and the last time my kids were miserable coming back because their siblings made it clear they did not want to be around them and they heard the older kids arguing with their grandparents over them and saying they weren't even their siblings.\n\nMy kids said they really didn't like going and so I decided, for my kids sake, that would be it. This past weekend my ILs arranged for another family gathering and I did not send my kids. When asked why I was honest and told them it had not been good for my children to face that rejection. My ILs said it might take time but at least there would be some hope with continued contact between them. I told them I needed to protect my children.

If the grandparents want a relationship they can have one on your terms that do not make your children miserable.", "Yeah, NAH.\n\nTeenagers are not in the most compassionate headspace. Younger kids can\u2019t understand being rejected like that. \n\nBasically no one is set up for success here. You\u2019re not going to ask your kids to accept being treated poorly. The teens are not going to pull their shit together and be kind to the little kids. \n\nYou gave it a shot, but you can\u2019t let your kids learn that they aren\u2019t worthwhile, which they will if they feel like their constantly being rejected by \u201cfamily\u201d. Tell your in-laws you appreciate what they are trying to do, but you\u2019ll try it again in a few years when everyone has grown up a bit more and has a better shot at working through it.", "NAH", "NTA, and tell your IL that the asshole here is the ex wife. She groomed in her kids their rejection to their siblings, so if they want to be mad with someone, it should be her and I would even say her kids too. Even when you are entitled to feel whatever you want, they are still jerks.", "A lot of people describe selfish scenarios, but you aren\u2019t. You\u2019re describing a situation where your children are telling you very specific things other people are saying and doing that are making them uncomfortable. This is the definition of a reason to not force your kids to go as long as their semi-estranged siblings are going to be there. \n\nYour MIL probably has this nobly idea of mending relations for their son and bringing all of his kids together. That\u2019s great, IF the kids are all willing to participate. When one or more of the kids decides to be spoiled brats \u2014 no matter their age \u2014 there\u2019s less and less that can be done as they get older and especially once they\u2019re adults. Let your MIL know that you and your children value their relationship with her, and the rest of your husband\u2019s family, but that your children have had it with being treated poorly by their their older siblings. I\u2019d even phrase it like that. Instead of half\u2019s or from his first marriage, just call them the older siblings. \n\nPoint out that they\u2019re old enough to behave better and aren\u2019t and that if they\u2019re going to be at a gathering, party, or event of any size your kids won\u2019t be attending until their older siblings can behave better. In this way you\u2019re not denying her or the rest of the family access, you\u2019re not saying they can never be in the same place. You\u2019re setting definable terms on the separation from their older siblings and it\u2019s something they can fully control and even agree to. Will you be nice to your younger siblings? Yes, great, no, too bad. From that point on, any family gatherings that include your husband\u2019s kids from his first wife are choosing to exclude his children with you, and I\u2019d have a conversation with any other available family members about this as well. All of your husband\u2019s children deserve to be treated with respect, not just some of them.", "INFO \n\nDid they know your kids weren't coming, or were they thinking they were coming and waiting around for them to show?", "NTA protect your kids. I laws mean well, but they are pushing everyone.", "NTA.  I can understand your ILs wanting the kids to have a relationship but it's not happening and it's making YOUR kids miserable.  I'd lower the boom.  They can visit your ILs ONLY when the other kids are not present and I would check to make sure they are honoring that boundary.", "NTA your children don't need to be around people, or other kids, that don't want to be around them.", "Yep. I bet MIL\u2019s idea of bonding is making them babysit and entertain the younger siblings- it will just increase their resentment", "NTA The grandparents are using your children to make their other children look good. Your little don't deserve to be used like that.\n\nI'm a widow too.  I'm so very, very sorry about your husband. There are no words for your pain.", "NTA A 15 and 16 year old is not going to change their mind until they have matured a lot more. Some of these Reddit comments I read make me think that could be about 40.", "NTA, your children are your only priority here. You're doing what's best for them.", "NTA.  Your kids are miserable with whatever is happening, and you are right to stop it.", "Your children's peace of mind and self-esteem and place of belonging within a family is important. You are doing the correct thing to protect them.", "NAH - except for your step-kids and their mom.  I see what your ILs are trying to do, and commend them for it, but they need to realize that it's not working.  That's what you're trying to point out to them.  Keep doing what you're doing to protect your children.  I encourage you to schedule time for your kids to go see their grandparents, but only when the step-siblings aren't there.", "NTA. The time for the grandparents to act was when all of this started, not after a tragedy in the family. They need to get over themselves, and if they don't then limit your kids' time with them.", "Nta.  You can't force a blended family and I'm glad you recognize it.  Kids will hate you, but it's just how it is.  You did a good job advocating for your children, which shows you're more than capable of being a good mom, despite what the step kiddos say.", "NTA\n\nWhat are your ILs doing to support and protect your grieving children at these family get togethers? It sounds as if your kids have been subjected to rejection and abuse by their half-sibs at these events. Why hadn't the grandparents prepared the teens with expectations about their civil, if not friendly, behavior around and about their preteen half-sibs? I suspect the grandparents expect repeated exposure alone to create a civil relationship between the kids when resentment and hatred has been cultivated by the ex-wife since her kids were toddlers.\n\nA year is not a very long time when grieving the loss of a parent. ALL of those children need support. I don't think your kids should be around the ex and the half-sibs without your being there to protect and support your children. Probably forever. For weddings, etc, on dad's side, you should accompany your children. Without your active presence, they should not attend those functions.\n\nYou can continue to support your children's relationships with their grandparents by encouraging interaction during times the ex and half-sibs are not around or involved.\n\nIt's really sad that the ex has fostered resentment in her kids. It's inappropriate for your kids to have to face that resentment and hostility without active adult support, intervention and protection during those interactions. The half-sibs need help and support, probably professional, to process their trauma around losing their dad, first partially through divorce (and the emotional barriers cultivated), and now recently through his passing.", "NTA\n\nGrandparents are forcing your kids into an uncomfortable situation. They need to give up on step kids accepting their half siblings. \n\nYou are protecting your kids", "NTA Most teenagers already wouldn't enjoy hanging around kids that young, especially if the relationship is strained like it is. \n\nIf the older kids feel open in the future there can be discussion, but right now the best thing to do is to just let things be. You're doing the right thing.", "NTA and for heavens sake, everyone is likely still GRIEVING. All 4 kids over the loss of their father, and your 2 kids over being rejected by family. Your inlaws are being selfish, because while they want to fix this in their grief, they aren't having to console mistreated children- and my guess is that's a lot while you're grieving too!\n\nI'm so sorry. Hopefully they can get through this phase quickly.", "16 and 15 acting like that? Wtf.", "Can also have the younger kids see their grandparents without the half-siblings present!", "NTA but I would suggest separate visits without the other kids so they can still keep a relationship with their grandparents and then try again in a few years when they are older and have matured a little more and have more time to grieve their dad. \n\nIt\u2019s not healthy for them to have a negative experience every time they go over so protect them and perhaps wait until the older kids are out of high school and have some hindsight.", "op=NTA\n\nGrandparents can see the kids at your home or at times when stepkids are not there.\n\nYour kids do not deserve to be abused by them.", "NTA. Tell them about AITA. They are breaking the main rule about the integration of step kids and/or half siblings: TRYING TO FORCE A RELATIONSHIP ALWAYS, AND I MEAN ALWAYS, HAS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. Tell them this, what all us aita readers know.", "NTA. Protect your kids.", "Nta honestly, I would have told them that if I, as their mother, is not welcome, then my kids will not be coming.  They can come to *your* house to spend time with their grandkids.", "NAH EXCEPT for the EX. The grandparents are simply misguided and want their grandchildren to get along, the older kids aren't wrong for not waiting to have a relationship with your kids who are probably a reminder of how their dad left their mom, changing their whole lives, you are absolutely correct in giving the older kids the space they clearly want by removing your kids from the situation. I don't think I have to say why the EX is TA.", "NTA. And tell the so called grandparents to butt out and stop trying to force your children to be around spoiled brats. At that age, that\u2019s exactly what they are. I was friends for 52 years with a woman who now hates me and I won\u2019t dare force her to come around. Don\u2019t force uncomfortable situations on your kids:", "I think OP should go WITH kids to any future family gatherings and be prepared to walk out with kids if the grands don't listen.", "boy howdy do we see a lot of posts like that on here.", "NTA, you have to look out for your kids first.", "NTA. If they grandparents are that insistent then they can spend time w/ the bio children and the step children at different times. They don\u2019t have to have them all there at once.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea at all. I thought about it but getting into why she\u2019s not and if the ex wife attends these functions and if so why the OP doesn\u2019t is a whole lot to get into. Ideally there\u2019s a way of doing that without inviting herself or forcing herself on the family. It does seem odd that she\u2019s not invited."]}
