You both want the same thing with your respective families, so you just need to choose if you can't find a compromise.\n\nIt's totally fair to not want to push the kids to stay up until too late, so sharing the day would be a solution, but you refuse to do that because you insist on having dinner with YOUR family. Why do you want to push this through so much? You yourself say that Noche Buena is an evening thing, so it makes sense to do that later on the day. Why can't you guys do that between 16-21 h, and then have 10-15 h on the same day with your family? Then your family gets lunch and an afternoon snack, and her family gets dinner.\n\nYou all need to learn to share. Sounds like you aren't willing to make much of a compromise. An alternative is that this year you guys spend the day with her family and then next year you spend the day with your family.\n\nSounds like this breakfast is also open to your family so why can't your fam just show up to that if you are that insistent on spending so much time with them?", "YTA sounds like your wife is willing to compromise and you are less willing to compromise.\n\nHave you brought the problem to your parents?

So ... This is a tradition that mostly started when he was a kid and into adulthood ... Like a one generation tradition.

Reading between the lines of your post and trying to guess where everybody is coming from (my guess did not factor into ruling) was the situation that you would see your family Xmas Eve, and then see her family Xmas day because they live so close, but now she wants to see both family Xmas Eve and the \u201ctrade\u201d is that both families are welcome at your house Xmas day?  I\u2019d that is the case, what is the attendance for Xmas day likely to be in terms if family composition?

As I understand it, the situation is basically that you\u2019ve done things one way, now your wife wants to propose a switch that keeps the important parts of her family tradition (the evening events) but eliminates the part of yours you seem to care most about (dinner). So to all the people saying you need to compromise by doing that, or that your family should create a new tradition to accommodate time With her families\u2019 tradition, I think those people are just wrong (or maybe either I or they are not understanding the situation).

It means finding new ways to relate to the holidays, and making new traditions for the family that __*I*__ am in charge of.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to compromise, and the kids are still under 5, in the ridiculously intense ages.

I live about an hour away from my folks and my daughter is 2.5 years old.  Once a week, every week, I took my daughter to Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s house to visit.

These weren\u2019t big family gatherings or anything, just time for her and I to spend with him.

I even got her Halloween costume early so she could wear and Grandpa could see her in it.  We had just been told he had about a week to live and he passed away on October 17th but he got to see her in her little costume and it made him smile. Those visits, stories, pictures, memories and videos are worth more than gold. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy doing this all the time.  My husband and I own our own business and it was stressful and time consuming, not going to lie.  I packed out everything the night before and it was either in the truck or ready to be loaded.

We ate more fast food than I liked because we didn\u2019t have time to cook.\n\nNone of that matters.  Make the time to spend with your family outside of those holidays.
