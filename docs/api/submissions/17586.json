When I turned 18 I thought things would change and I would have the liberty to do some things that I was not allowed to do before, like staying over at my gfs house or staying out late, but no, they started using the \"my house my rules\" so I kinda gave up. Turned 19 and still nothing, my girl and I already started having a serious relationship and wanted my parents to see that, got a stable job and income and payed my bills monthly and on time, but it seemed that no matter how many rights I do, any wrong I did no matter how tiny (like missing my cc payment or arriving home 30 minutes after I told my parents I would arrive) would make them think of me as still a kid. This year I turned 20 and also turned 2 years with my gf, since my bday I've been talking to my parents about giving me more liberties and freedom but their answer would still be the same (my house my rules). I started feeling depressed around 6 months ago and did not say anything to them with fear of them belittling me or not understanding how I felt, until one day I decided to tell them how I really felt and of course, they did exactly what I was afraid of, telling me I had no right to feel this way and they've always given me everything and treated me perfectly. I asked them to get me a therapist and they agreed, months passed and I was seeing my therapist every week, and she told me that my feelings were perfectly valid and a good cause for these feelings is the way that my parents treat me, treating me still like a kid. Skipping to two nights ago, I bought some computer parts that I really wanted because I'll get a promotion at work soon and have some nice savings, they went into my bank accounts, amazon and newegg account and saw everything I purchased then decided to ground me with the car and even tried to cancel the newegg order (but it was already shipped so they couldn't). After years of dealing with this I took it into my own hands to leave the house, I worked that day so I was planning how I would go about it, first I asked my gf's mom if I could stay at their house, she agreed, then I argued with my parents on the phone explaining how the way they have been treating me is only pushing me farther away and nothing. Finished work, went to my house and my mom would not say a word to me, went upstairs made some bags and left the house. It's been two days now since I left and my parents haven't contacted me, but they have called my gf and her mom and told them that what they did was wrong, they should not have opened their doors to me and should have left me in the street so I would go back to them.

If you can afford to move out, it is well within your right to do so.", "ESH - I may get downvoted for this, but if you are living at your parent's house they are going to treat you like a child.  Moving out is the right answer, but you seem to carry a lot of resentment toward someone who was giving you a place to live for free.  You should have moved out at 18, but it doesn't sound like you were actually mature enough to do that.\n\nYou did the right thing, but do try and gain some overall perspective on this.", "You sound incredibly immature and entitled here.  You\u2019re parents are right - their house, their rules, and if you don\u2019t like it you can leave.  I\u2019m also guessing that you have a job but don\u2019t pay rent, right?  Instead you spend a lot of money on computer parts, and spend most of your free time gaming instead of helping around the house? Am I off base in my assumptions? \n\nAnd they are probably right in that your GF\u2019s family shouldn\u2019t have interjected themselves into your family issues.  \n\nBut hey - your parents are the ones who will probably come out on top.  Unless your GF\u2019s parents want to adopt you, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make you pay rent or at least contribute to the household chores, and your parents can rest assured safe in the knowledge the the world is going to hand you the lesson they were trying to teach before it was too late.  \n\nYou\u2019ve made your own bed.  Now you\u2019ll have to chip in for it.\n\nPS - Forgot to add NTA, though.  You have every right to move out.

I don't agree with the \"my house my rules\" to an extent but I always tried to stay within their lines when it came to that. Right now I am planning on paying rent with my gfs parents, and I have no problem in doing so because tbh if my parents had accepted the countless of times I asked them to pay my part of the rent I would have done it without thinking twice.

First off I never lied to my parents, I have lied to my parents a total of probably two times throughout my life, I've learned the hard way that lying to my parents only gets me in more trouble. I bought the parts without telling them. Investing in your own future? Every-time I wanted to buy things for myself they would say no, and not a no as in I'll buy them for you, but a no as in you can't have it. I would completely understand this position if the money did not come from a reliable source of income at the time that was a job. I don't know how you are correlating a few computer parts to a down payment on an apartment but the truth is that I'm staying at my gfs parent's house because I never had the chance to even sleep with her in her own bed and we have been together for years now, so now that I have the chance to spend some time with her without my parents forcing me to come back home before midnight I will take advantage of it. Thank you for your wishes on house hunting! Seems those wishes worked because I will be staying at my university's student housing starting August!", "Lol, at 14 years old he started/allowed to work but not spend any money. The fact that he is attempting to show he can handle himself in order to gain \"more\" freedom shows he's trying to gain some control of his now adult life. He didn't want to move out, he wanted to grow into an adult, and when he took a chance to do so they go behind his back in an attempt to make him homeless.\n\nWhy does it matter that he bought a simple pleasure? It's that wrong to do? Also, renting an apartment vs buying 100$ worth of RAM is a ridiculous comparison when housing for a 1 bedroom is over a grand depending on where you live.\n\nHe is proving that he can act like an adult. He took his freedom with help from those who were willing to help him and is essentially gonna be renting a room with his gf's parents... You sound like he should be able to buy a house instead of living with roommates like literally so many other adults.\n\nJust because his parents are teaching him to save does not mean they can't be abusive or harmfully restrictive. Who are you to judge anothers familiar relationships and goad his purchases and decision to move out?\n\nWhy so antagonist? He literally did what you told him to already. He left and is surviving like many others.", "I already changed the password of the accounts that they accessed, and will be changing all of my passwords just in case. As for documents when I left I took my passport but left my social security card. I guess I'll have to go back and grab anything else I might have left :/", "And on this matter, I already do that, I constantly pay for my car, insurance and gas. Although the car is on my mom's name (grave mistake) so the night they left they kept the car because legally it's theirs. Now I'm using my gfs car.", "Loving parents allow their child to grow up and become independent. OPs parents wanted control and dominance without an end in sight. Good evidence of this is refusing to allow him to take his car even though he paid for it. \n\nA bit of space for a few months while OP establishes himself as an independent adult is the best thing here to salvage the relationship. Maybe the parents anxiety/attachment will have settled down by then.", "I appreciate your views, but unplanned pregnancy? I think I've proved myself in that aspect enough with more than 2 years of relationship and nothing having happened. But sure, when I turn 30 and still live with them they will use the same excuse \"but we don't want you to get her pregnant\" when does it end? If I haven't proved myself until now then I never will in their eyes. I've never said they don't care not once, they are loving parents but their overbearingness needs to end once it gets to a certain point.

I do think that the best strategy is just to keep going forward and if they want to dialogue I am here to listen.

I am hoping for a recovery in the relationship with my parents. I still love them even after all this.", "That's also fair. I however don't think loving parents would advocate others to make him homeless in order to manipulate him into coming back.", "Wow so they are not even interested in talking to you. They probably realize it's futile trying to control you anymore so are trying to control the people around you.
