Turned 19 and still nothing, my girl and I already started having a serious relationship and wanted my parents to see that, got a stable job and income and payed my bills monthly and on time, but it seemed that no matter how many rights I do, any wrong I did no matter how tiny (like missing my cc payment or arriving home 30 minutes after I told my parents I would arrive) would make them think of me as still a kid. This year I turned 20 and also turned 2 years with my gf, since my bday I've been talking to my parents about giving me more liberties and freedom but their answer would still be the same (my house my rules). I started feeling depressed around 6 months ago and did not say anything to them with fear of them belittling me or not understanding how I felt, until one day I decided to tell them how I really felt and of course, they did exactly what I was afraid of, telling me I had no right to feel this way and they've always given me everything and treated me perfectly.

After years of dealing with this I took it into my own hands to leave the house, I worked that day so I was planning how I would go about it, first I asked my gf's mom if I could stay at their house, she agreed, then I argued with my parents on the phone explaining how the way they have been treating me is only pushing me farther away and nothing.

First off I never lied to my parents, I have lied to my parents a total of probably two times throughout my life, I've learned the hard way that lying to my parents only gets me in more trouble.

I don't know how you are correlating a few computer parts to a down payment on an apartment but the truth is that I'm staying at my gfs parent's house because I never had the chance to even sleep with her in her own bed and we have been together for years now, so now that I have the chance to spend some time with her without my parents forcing me to come back home before midnight I will take advantage of it.

Also, renting an apartment vs buying 100$ worth of RAM is a ridiculous comparison when housing for a 1 bedroom is over a grand depending on where you live.\n\nHe is proving that he can act like an adult. He took his freedom with help from those who were willing to help him and is essentially gonna be renting a room with his gf's parents... You sound like he should be able to buy a house instead of living with roommates like literally so many other adults.\n\nJust because his parents are teaching him to save does not mean they can't be abusive or harmfully restrictive.

I think I've proved myself in that aspect enough with more than 2 years of relationship and nothing having happened.

They told me that I had a much better deal staying with them because I didn't have to give them money, and that others my age would kill to be in my shoes. I actually dreamt of the day I COULD pay rent somewhere. But yes, them refusing to accept rent from you is definitely another control tactic", "Just stop.

That is making unauthorised use of his bank accounts and he has no protection if they do take money from his accounts \"for his own good\".\n\nOverbearing may be about caring. But it can also be about control. OP has never had the chance to mature as an adult within their home, to make and learn from mistakes. Because they are still seeing him as a 14 year old child. From someone with a similar dynamic even after 4 years away at uni, OP would be wise to go low-contact until his parents respect boundaries and stop trying to punish him for setting them. Engrained patterns of behaviour like this are really hard to break.", "Yes, you do cut your parents off because they have a problem letting go. That's called thinking about your mental health and well being. Being overbearing does not mean \"caring\", it means controlling. There's no love in that, that's obsession. Completely unhealthy", "Seriously, do not listen to that person. I was LITERALLY in your shoes when I was your age. I was just like you: great kid, good grades, worked young and saved up a great bit of money. I managed to move out when I was 23 in 2008 after my therapist told me for a year straight that I needed to do so NOW or I would never be able to leave. My parents continued to brow-beat me by enforcing phone rules, but I had established boundaries with them before I left the state regarding that (per my therapist's guidance) and told them I was sticking to it. I stuck to those boundaries when they called one time and I didn't answer the phone because I didn't feel like talking to them at that time (told them I would only pick up the phone when I felt like talking to them, was not going to force myself to talk to them because THEY wanted to talk). My phone blew up for days, which pissed me off and it made me not want to talk to them more. My mom then called my roommate, then his mom, then my BOSS, who all told her I was fine. I answered the day she called my boss to end the bullshit, and she \"bawled\" crocodile tears; the moment I told her to stop, it was like a switch flip. She said if I ever did that again, she was calling the police and having me put in a mental ward. I called her bluff and told her to go ahead, because I knew she wouldn't. She threatened in her voicemails to do it, and she never did. I also told her that I was being true to my word before I left the state: I wasn't going to answer the phone if I didn't want to talk to them. Therefore, I was going to do it again. And if she blew up my phone again, I would turn it off. But what she was not going to do was call anyone that had contact with me ever again. If something happened to me, THEY would call HER as she was still listed as ICE in my phone. I told my contacts if they saw her number, don't answer. They backed off...a little until my dad died in 2012. He and I reconciled, he apologized and admitted he was wrong for what he did in my childhood. My mom only tried harder, and it got so bad that I went NC in 2013 when she said I didn't know how to be in love, only obsessed, with no evidence to back that statement up (something she did all through my childhood: accused me of having a horrible character attribute with no evidence that I was that kind of person). I told her I would consider talking to her if she gave me space and an apology. She did neither of those things and she never heard my voice again. She tried many times to physically see me, which were shot down through my uncle (her brother), and she continued to send me texts and emails (that I left unread) like we were just fine. To quote her: \"You just need to get over whatever it is you're going through. We're fine because I said we're fine.\" The texts and emails stopped when I got rid of that number and that email address. She died in 2021, no tears were shed on my end. \nStick to your guns, and go by YOUR judgement. Not your parents. They are in the wrong here, and you have to be prepared for the possibility that they won't change. It took my dad DYING to get him to see how much he messed up, and my mom still stayed true to her stuborness and insisted she was right (she opined to my uncle for years that I owed HER an apology for \"abusing\" her by not talking to her) up until her end. I understand that you love them, but you REALLY need to think about you right now. Get yourself established, find your own way. Getting out of that house and setting my boundaries were the best things I ever did for myself. Had I stayed, i wouldn't have been able to take care of myself or discover who I am as a person. That's what you need to do. After you've accomplished this, if you think you want to reestablish a relationship with them, do so with the guidance of your therapist. I very much hope your folks get sense knocked into them and change, I really do. But for right now, YOU are the priority and going NC with them is the best thing for you.", "My response would be, \"You are right. Your house, your rules.

They pulled the, \"my house my rules,\" card until you left at which point they didn't interact with you, but screamed at someone else for providing you a safe landing pad, because your parents know the only way they can get you to abide them is through strongarming you.

Insisting on controlling and micromanaging everything isn\u2019t preparing you for adulthood, it\u2019s preventing you from even getting there. Being there for your adult kids when they need you? Absolutely. But this is not healthy and not helping you in any way. I know it\u2019s hard since they\u2019re your parents but do what you need to do for yourself, it\u2019s your life.
