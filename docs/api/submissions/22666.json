She has even decided to homeschool her 10 year old now, the main reason being that she needs his help taking care of his two siblings. \n\nMy parents and I did not have a very enthusiastic reaction to the pregnancy announcement, and I explained to her that she barely has time to take care of the kids she has now. I also brought up that its not fair to her oldest that she\u2019s preventing him from from having a proper education because she wants him to be her full time babysitter.\n\nShe blew up on my parents and I and said we shouldn\u2019t tell her how to parent her own kids and it was breaking her heart that we weren\u2019t excited for her about the new baby. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1689799043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154675b/aita_for_not_being_excited_about_my_sisters/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone has to look out for the poor kid. Maybe your attitude will make her rethink how she\u2019s handling things at home. 10 year olds need kids their own age, not babies to take care of. I hope something changes!", "NTA. Your sister wanted cheerleaders in her path of abusing her oldest child, and bringing yet another child into what seems like a terrible household (she can't handle the kids she does have, she won't handle another one).\n\nIt's like seeing someone going to drive drunk and not saying anything - she is hurting one child, and the younger ones won't be that much better as they grow up in such an environment.\n\nShe got mad because you were willing to tell her the truth. Her heart is breaking because you're not excited her and her husband are adding another innocent child into this mess? But parentifying her own child is not?\n\nI feel sorry for all these kids.", "NTA and send your sister [this](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/what-is-parentification)", "LOL NTA your sister sounds like an awful mother who not only is robbing her kid of an education but also a childhood forcing them to take in the role of a parent", "Nta", "YTA when you said something. You can feel however you want, but you aren't entitled to comment on someone else's pregnancy.", "NTA- pleas call cps for that poor boy .", "NTA. I feel for that 10 year old who has to be the parent for his siblings, because she obviously can\u00b4t handle it. Was it nice to say to her? No. But some people have to hear the truth at least once before they ask themselves, why their children went NC with them. Now she could have at least the chance to think about it.", "\u201cShe has even decided to homeschool her 10 year old now, the main reason being that she needs his help taking care of his two siblings.\u201d\n\nThis is so not okay. Your poor nephew. This is SO NOT OKAY.\n\nNTA if you\u2019d raised these concerns before. E S H if you hadn\u2019t said anything about your nephew before she announced the next pregnancy.", "NTA for not being excited-  but have any of you ever said anything about the taking the 10 yr old out of school to help raise her baby?!  I mean that is the asshole here and should have had the conversation well before she had time to get pregnant again - esh her for being a terrible mum, dad the same, you and your parents for not trying to protect her sons education / general well being earlier", "Here's the thing I agree with you, but YTA. \n\nNot for not being excited but for putting her down after sharing the news.  She didn't come to you for advice if she should have the child she was just sharing the news", "Nope! Selfish people should be called out. She\u2019s a Horrible mother and shouldn\u2019t be bringing anymore kids into this world. Wow. Her poor children.", "NTA.  She can't properly care for the kids she already has, how are you supposed to be enthusiastically excited that your oldest nephew is getting screwed out of his education and childhood?", "Another baby that poor 10-year-old will have to raise.... God... Your sister is going to pay dearly when the 10 year old leaves and never speaks to her again.\n\nNTA", "NTA that's child abuse. Parentification is abuse. You all know that 10yo child will not have an education if his mother pulls him out of school. I mean, how is she supposed to home school him with 3 other children to care for., she will not have the time. Someone needs to save that boy. Please call CPS.", "NTA. God, that poor ten year old.

But...the pregnancy announcement was not the time for this conversation. You should have raised this much earlier to protect that 10 year old. I'm gonna say ESH for that reason.", "Please OP, reason 3 is huge.\nDenying a child of an education is a form of abuse.\nIt's even worse that the only reason for this is to help her out with the younger kids, not to help/for the betterment of her eldest.", "...and they'd tell you that you're a lunatic", "When you make that sort of announcement you\u2019re doing it for the reaction.\n\nIn this case, even not commenting would\u2019ve been seen as disapproval.\n\nYou think they should have lied and praised her?", "When someone tells you their business, you are entitled to a reaction and opinion. Not to mention that parentification is a form of child abuse. If the 10 year old is missing out on school to be a mini parent that is abuse. Not only is OP entitled to an opinion on that but they are morally obligated to contact CPS to make sure their nephew is getting an education and childhood.", "This was my thoughts to. This is not okay. Cps will also help her get the help she needs. I learned through my exs child's mother they even have a program where someone will take the kids for a little bit to give the mom a break like a free babysitter. Thats in missouri though.", "It sound like she it \"home schooling\" her 10 year old so that it can do more chores, which to me is  a form of abuse", "We\u2019ve voiced our opinion to her before that he needs to be in public school for multiple different reasons, but there\u2019s not much to do since they live a few states away.", "This! I teach middle school and we have a family that had some issues with attendance before covid. But now? I saw one student twice during 2023. They use their kids as babysitters and don\u2019t seem to care that they are destroying their educational future.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like she can do much in the way of homeschooling if she\u2019s busy with the 2-year-old, either - which means it is really just babysitting. That\u2019s so horrible. A good homeschooling plan is nothing to sneeze at, but it doesn\u2019t sound like this is one of those situations", "Really good point.", "yeah.  the pregnancy is already here.  very weird to be so critical at this point because what could possibly be done?\n\nOP be like \"I'm going to be hyper-critical of you needlessly even though there's nothing you can do to in response to criticism.  So I'm just here hoping that you feel like shit\"\n\nWhat good does that do?  It helps nobody\n\nOP, YTA", "No they should have just not commented. That's better than giving unasked for opinions.  Was their opinion right, yes but I wasn't asked for.  Its sad but the truth", "No they aren't.", "Yes, the first thing I thought about was \"parentification\".", "10 year old is being parentified. I doubt she has time to properly home school the elder child. That child needs real school.", "I do understand your point and if there wasn't a 10 year old who is being neglected here, then I would agree. But there is. Someone needs to say something for his sake.", "Think about it.\n\nAnnouncement made. \nNo one comments.\nPregnancy announcer pushes the point \u2018why aren\u2019t you saying anything, aren\u2019t you happy for me\u2019\nNo one comments.\nPregnancy announcer has a meltdown.\n\nBasically, same outcome.\n\nOnly different outcome would come from lying."]}
