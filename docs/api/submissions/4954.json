You barely know the stepson.\n\nMy dad remarried.  I have 2 stepsisters.  Those stepsisters absolutely got gifts from family members that I barely knew;  and I never even got a card.  And that seems 100% normal to me - because I didn't know them.  Likewise, my Great Aunt/Uncle (my dad's aunt/uncle) used to get me gifts at the holidays.

It\u2019s not like you gave him socks.\n\nLike you said, this child is a stranger to you and you\u2019ve had 14 years of spoiling your niece.  Your Bro and his wife are trying to protect their child.  At the same time, they cannot dictate how you spend your money.

To me that says he wants you guys to accept him into your lives. I\u2019m not saying you should spend the same amount of money on him as you did your niece because you\u2019re right, you don\u2019t have that bond yet, but maybe get him a experience you and your other brothers can do with him so you can get to know him. \n\nYou guys having no interest in him could cause conflict with your brother later if he sees your favoritism as a problem and wants to protect his stepson and new nuclear family\u2019s cohesiveness from that.", "I can't say that either side of this disagreement is particularly wrong. Sometimes everyone can be right at the same time. You're right and so is your SIL. But, it's Christmas. You can either be generous and make a child happy or not. You're not wrong either way.

Let him know that once you get to know him then you will be able to get more personalized gifts for him. Maybe even ask to take him out to his fav restaurant for lunch. That way he will be more understanding as to why he didnt get as many gifts but it will still show you respect him as a member of the family. He will probably be feeling quite awkward anyway seeing as he doesn't know any of you very well either so it will make him feel like one of you if he has more than a pair of shoes. My kids are adults but whenever they have had boyfriends or girlfriends around the holidays we always try to make sure that we ask what they want or need and get them some gifts so they feel welcome around the holidays.

Every response you give to other comments just solidifies how assholish your behavior is. No, no one expects you to give 100% equally, but you don\u2019t have to make the difference so damn obvious, either. If you can\u2019t get your new nephew another gift or two, then think about holding back a couple of your niece\u2019s gifts.

When I was six she took us to her current husband's family place, and I had to watch every other person open all the gifts while I was given a country music TAPE (lol yeah kinda dating myself here) that was not even wrapped. One of the worst experiences of my childhood. I feel like it will be worse for the nephew as he will understand why you are treating him this way. How are you going to feel when Bro goes NC and you don't have niece in your life anymore?", "YTA, I'm child free and just got 3 bonus niblings this year. Of course I want to spoil the neice I have a strong connection with, but she has 3 siblings I need to foster a connection with now as well. I can spoil her on her birthday or other one-on-one events but NOT on shared holidays. On shared holidays all of the kids need to be treated equally. \n\nYou need to accept that your brother's family has changed, if you don't want to foster that connection- whatever, but you still need to at minimum not be a jerk to the kid. You don't have to spend tons of money on him, but at least hold onto some of those gifts to give your neice for another event or in private. It is no longer appropriate for a shared holiday.", "This is a tough one. I'm leaving towards YTA because you seem adamantly opposed to being told you're wrong in this. While I don't feel like it's right for your brother to guilt trip you about it, why are you so against buying more gifts for him? He's a child, he deserves to have a good Christmas. Hell learn soon enough what a cold and difficult place the world can be without you teaching him. You don't have to spend a lot of money to be thoughtful. Go to the dollar store, get a stocking, and fill it with useful stuff from there. Deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, whatever cologne spray they might have, some simple tools (I know they have tape measurers and needle nose pliers), etc. Your can probably fill a stocking for like 10$. And if he's a good kid, he'll be grateful, even if he doesn't like everything you pick out. Get him a 5$ Starbucks gift card, or McDonald's. Show this kid that he is part of the family now.", "Imagine, just for a second, that instead of coming to your side of the family this Christmas they were going to your new SIL\u2019s family.

That she had to spend what is supposed to be \u201cthe most wonderful time of the year\u201d watching as her new stepbrother got multiple expensive presents while she was treated like an afterthought. \n\nDoes that idea sit comfortably with you? Would you think that those people were kind hearted people acting completely reasonably while your much loved niece is made to feel like trash on Christmas Day?

If your brother is to have another kid with his new wife how many years old will that child need to be old enough to be part of the family/receive gifts from you?

He is 15, he will notice that he is not being as included. Get him a few more gifts that are small but meaningful so he doesn't feel like an outsider as his step sister gets all the gifts. I understand you don't know him but you could at least make him feel welcomed. Teenagers are sensitive especially ones that just got added to a totally new family. Don't act like cause he is old enough to \"understand\" that he will. It will sting. Welcome him, make him feel like part of the family. He is now and it seems like you don't care about that.

I was not one of those kids, in fact not once in my life have I ever gotten the thing I had actually asked for, for any gift giving occasion. Sometimes you just have to be grateful with what you\u2019re given. Also they never said the dollar value of the gifts we don\u2019t know if they spent close to equal amount on niece and nephew but she gets 15 little things and boy gets one thing that cost the same. \n\nApparently graciousness in receiving gifts is not something that\u2019s taught to people anymore. It\u2019s a pretty gross and entitled attitude to be completely honest. The kid should honestly be happy he\u2019s getting anything at all. Lots of people get nothing. And apparently the whole purpose of Christmas is lost on you if you\u2019re focussing on the material aspect of it alone and not the value of quality time with family and people you care about. SMH.

You\u2019re totally right about gifts being about relationship. He dropped $$150 on shoes for the stranger. That\u2019s plenty, really.

She is, and always will be, family.", "Yes. You realize there are numerous programs where good people spend time and money to fulfill a kids Christmas desires. It happens all the time, and those are actual strangers... this kid is only temporary a stranger which is why you do your due diligence and start and build a relationship with them so that he is NOT a stranger.", "For a kid, yeah.

And you double down on it.", "Couldn\u2019t you have set a budget which was proportionate? Say $100 to $400 for stepnephew and niece was what you felt was fair and you bought him multiple smaller things that look like \u2018a lot\u2019 but could also be used as ways to get to know him?\n\nFor example if you always give niece a candy bar, find out what his favourite is and explain the tradition on the tag. Or buy three \u2018lucky dip\u2019 ones and ask him which is his yes, no, in an emergency rating.\n\nYou could give all kinds of things linked to creating a family feel that aren\u2019t expensive, you can buy good quality used books, games etc. Some socks, stocking stuffers etc. All in your budget.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing: you love your niece right? Well what better gift than showing you respect her family has officially blended since last Christmas? Welcome it if she does by modelling hospitality, help her navigate it if struggling by bridging it with hospitality.\n\nYou can also buy inexpensive things like a Christmas decoration for them each for their first family of four and start a cheap tradition. Buy a board game for the whole family to bond over. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to throw cash at him. That could be a bribe or too much. But the paucity of welcome is a definite declaration of creating difference. Thoughtfulness is free and would serve everyone well here. So YTA for the sullen attitude about the shoes being his size, why would you bother etc and the fact you have deliberately gone for one moment of a gift versus giving your niece hours of opening the hours of things you spent time choosing, wrapping etc. He\u2019s a teen. He understands that disparity of effort over money.\n\nThe shoes as a one off could be fair if you were gifting them with grace. It would be better here to give him Axe gift sets and a warm welcome if you are really stuck on how to buy for a stranger.  Don\u2019t most people keep an emergency generic gift handy for surprise guests anyway where cookies or candy say \u2018we are glad are you are\u2019 even if you really think \u2018but we have no idea who you are?\u2019\n\nYTA because you are opting for the surefire way to make an issue. The kid probably doesn\u2019t expect strangers to him are going to buy him a PS5 but he\u2019s going to be hurt by the vibe you are creating and it is going to make the day awkward for niece, brother and new wife.

This is awkward and uncomfortable for everyone. 2. Your niece and nephew don\u2019t like each other.  Now your niece gets to be smug about all the gifts she\u2019s getting that he isn\u2019t, while he gets more and more upset and hurt and begins to resent her and you.
