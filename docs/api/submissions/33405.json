I prefer my quality time to be more interactive, but not everyone does. But if you're tired enough to fall asleep (or just be sleepy) you won't magically be able to will yourself to stay awake while in bed with a movie on. So play a game or do something else that will make your girlfriend feel appreciated.", "NTA. If you\u2019re exhausted, you\u2019re exhausted. Either find something else or she can enjoy the time she does have with you", "NTA - Being sleepy is not disrespectful it\u2019s not like your choosing to indulge in a nap?! You\u2019re dozing off after a long day. I\u2019m a chronic movie fall asleeper and my partner knows this, yet he still wants to watch stuff with me every night on discord when he gets off work. We both talk during movies/shows, predict what\u2019s gonna happen, critique camera angles and outfits, and say an actor looks familiar then go google them and their whole filmography. My partner values those small conversations and so do I. If your gf doesn\u2019t like talking during the movie she might value the chat after. The after-movie analysis is crucial so it sucks you guys can\u2019t do that sometimes. Since your day starts earlier than hers she should be more mindful of your exhaustion. Try watching one half and finishing the other later. It\u2019s weird at first but you get used to it. Me and my partner do it a lot. Just try to finish the movie within 3 days or you\u2019ll start to forget details.", "NTA. Your gf needs to be more understanding, however, you need to find things that you two can do without falling asleep. I understand your situation as i am on the same boat. I work nights and I get very tired when it\u2019s my day off. I fall asleep on movies and my husband gets mad at me for falling asleep. \n\nNo one should be punished for something they can\u2019t control, let alone normal body function.", "NTA. Laughed a bit at this because this happens to me and my bf ALL the time. Usually it\u2019s during the week when he wakes up much earlier than me. Our solution is don\u2019t watch movies during the week unless we start it at 7:00 latest or just some episodes of a show is fine. But even then, if he does end up catchin\u2019 Zs early I\u2019m cool just watching the rest of the show/movie myself then wake him up to head to bed. It\u2019s not like I made the movie so.", "NTA - you can't talk to each other during a movie, so how is that quality time? It's not like you are intentionally falling asleep. It's very normal for tired people to doze off during movies. If you are neglecting her of quality time, maybe try a different activity that is more engaging.", "who watches movies in bed? falling asleep is a natural response..... NTA. she really should have thought this through. theres a couch for movies.", "NTA. Explain to her that you work long hours and you can\u2019t stay up at night watching super long movies. Compromise idea, how about an episode of a show she\u2019s binge watching or you guys start a new show together? Those are usually 30-45 min only. Or you can save movie nights for weekend only.", "NTA. find a different thing to do with your girlfriend and have a long conversation about how you get exhausted.", "NTA. You clearly don't both value it in the same way, aren't looking for the same thing from it, and it seems like it's a matter of love language for her, and y'all need to find something to do together that you both enjoy in a similar enough way.", "Why don\u2019t you try watching a movie in the living room, while you\u2019re sitting on the couch? Many experts say that the bed should be used for two things, sleeping, and sex. but if you choose to watch a movie in the bed and fall asleep, so be it. She needs to get over it.", "People are saying YTA but honestly there\u2019s not enough context imo. What\u2019s preventing you from getting enough quality sleep? Resolving your sleep issue can help with staying awake during movie quality time with her. If you have a medical condition that impacts your sleep, seek necessary treatment. If treatment isn\u2019t accessible (you don\u2019t have access to a doctor) then try holistic remedies or split long movies in quarters or halves across a day or two. Exercise healthy communication with your girlfriend about what\u2019s getting in the way of meaningful quality time and discuss expectations prior to navigate needs and conflict. Sending well wishes to you both.\n\n-Signed a person who\u2019s has a gf who sleeps a ton likely because of an underlying sleep health issue\n\nIf you need any tips, feel free to PM or respond here.", "NTA, but your girlfriend feels neglected for you not paying attention to the experiences she\u2019s trying to share with you. NTA but if you value her relationship you need to solve this problem", "My GF does this and she always says \u201cI\u2019m just checking for cracks\u201d lol", "Maybe only watch half a movie or something. Nothing is lamer than someone chronically sleeping during movies or gets defensive when they're caught drifting off. YTA", "Yta\n\n\nNothing is worse than your partner not paying attention.  For me, it comes down to why bother doing something together if someone is just going to close their eyes or not being on the phone all the time.\n\n\nFor me, it's a sign of disrespect. It can be frustrating if you're trying to do something together and you don't actively participate.", "Lol you funny you weren't sleeping just closing your eyes.

How much time do you actually spend with her, where you guys are present with eachother?", "As long as you don't insist on picking (or really having any say) in the movies, NAH. The amount of times I've started a movie I wasn't too jazzed about for my girlfriend/now wife's sake only to watch it alone is aggravating.", "NTA tell her you would stay awake if she put out. Watching TV is not quality time.", "As someone who also can't stay interested/awake through movies, I totally get your side!\n\nNAH - but I agree you need to find another \"quality time\" activity you can both enjoy since it is obviously important to gf.", "This is too hard to say.\nIf she's craving time with you and this is all you're giving her and then falling asleep, YTAH\n\nSomething deeper is at play here.\n\nI have the same issue with my wife because we used to watch movies together all the time when dating, now she can't stay up. Nothings changed, she just isn't trying anymore and there's nothing wrong with that, I like that she's more comfortable with me. \n\nbut you can see how more info makes a difference.", "YTA\nResting your eyes while you\u2019re tired is just sleep foreplay", "You\u2019re the asshole", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
