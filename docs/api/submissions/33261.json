My parents (61 M and 63 F) love to do family activities and so do I. However over the past 18 months everything is being increasingly dictated by my sister's mood and her schedule. She is a registered nurse so her hours are already hard to schedule around. She will never meet the rest of the family at a location, she outright demands to be picked up. No matter if we have to drive in the complete opposite direction after picking her up.  I worked at Target when I was 20, I missed Thanksgiving and my parents and my sister left to go skiing on Christmas day that same year. I add this because she has made us reschedule both Christmas and Thanksgiving because she either worked that day or was \"too tired\" to get in her car and come to our parents' house. My parents travel a lot, but have two very elderly cats that need a lot of attention. My sister says she is too tired to drive an extra 10 mins to my parents' house to check on the cats. This forces me to stay at my parents house for 2-3 weeks sometimes when she could very easily drive an extra 10 mins after work and assist me so I didn't have to spend the night or just giving me a break, I work full time as well. My SO, that is medically handicapped might I add, has had to leave work early, multiple times, so she could be in the car with us to go pick up my sister because she will not meet us anywhere. I confronted my parents this evening about this and their response was, \"We have to do this because having the family together is what is most important to us\". I couldn't muster up a response that was not an insult so I just took my coat and left. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting my sister to act like an adult? Am I the asshole for the way I didn't respond to my parents?
