{"id": 31386, "submission_id": "17zy7vn", "title": "AITA for not wanting my aunt to help me plan my wedding?", "selftext": "My (27F) fiance (28M) proposed to me in October. We were so excited to share our announcement that we didn't think about my mother. My mother disowned me in March 2019 after my father died in November 2018 and since the disownment she has had her friends stalk me and everything I do. She was a gaslighting alcoholic and very manipulative and I am glad she is no longer in my life. After the announcement, she messaged me on facebook saying she was \"happy that I finally found a family to love me\". After that, my enthusiasm for the wedding waivered. Last week, I was fired. I thought the lack of stress would be nice so I would finally get to focus on my wedding and maybe even get a little excited about it again. My aunt, who was like a mother to me after I was disowned, reached out and said she was going to give us money for the wedding. THE DAY AFTER I WAS FIRED, my aunt told me she didn't understand why I wanted a wedding in the first place, calling it a \"hoopla\" and saying it was just a waste of money since we already lived together. I tried to explain to her the importance of a Jewish wedding to me and my fiance (she is roman catholic). The next day she said she thought it would be better in Atlanta (where she lives) rather than Miami. I tried to explain to her that my f's family has another wedding in October in TX so they would have to travel two times in two months, plus we want his grandfather to come and he doesn't travel well. She was quiet until Saturday when she called me telling me I was prioritizing his family over her and it wasn't fair I was making her and her three ADULT children choose between spending thousands of dollars or not coming to the wedding. Today was the last straw. She brought up a beach wedding, again. I had told her last week before she called my wedding a hoopla that I wanted a garden venue because we love to go hiking and I didn't want a beach wedding because of sand. What I didn't tell her was that the beach reminds me of my father, and having a wedding the same month he died is going to be hard enough, but having a beach wedding I will not be able to think about anything other than him. I thanked her for her opinion and information and left it at that. She came back saying that I was being snippy and ungrateful and she would just give me the money as soon as she could. I tried to explain to her that I had expressed disinterest in a beach wedding before and I didn't know what else to say. I told her I valued her information and I knew she was trying to be helpful, but she seemed to have a problem with everything we wanted and I just wanted to be heard. She came back with she was sorry she tried to help me. She told me \"you do you\" and if she gets invited she will be there, but her impression is my priority is my fiance's family. She's disappointed in my decisions but she's understanding that I want things to go well for my big day.
