There\u2019s a classic trope about a man telling his wife to take the night off - he\u2019s got dinner; he slaps steaks on the grill (which is a skill for sure) and she does all the rest including setting the table and cleaning up, and at the end of the night he gets accolades for giving his women the night off. This is that in real life. Good on you.", "NTA..your buddy J may not recall this interaction in 10 years but  i can gurandamntee you his wife will \ud83d\udc9c", "I mean no, but just cuz something takes more time doesnt mean they get some credit. They both get the credit and should be thankful for what they have (not saying they are not)", "NTA.... I'm sorry he should have said I cooked the meat. He just tried to take credit for the whole dinner. He had no part in any of it but the steak which wasn't that hard in the first place. Let me guess she marinated them for him as well. So glad that you gave the credit where it was due.", "NTA (edit from N A H) seems like nobody was actually mad. (Edit cont., \u201cI made dinner!\u201d is too rough to let slide.)\n\nWith respect to grilling, there can be artistry (rubs, seasoning, marinades, etc.) buuuuut \u2026 I mean c\u2019mon. From this story clearly none of that happened. Did my brother even salt and pepper on the grill? I\u2019m a vegan and still embarrassed for the dude.", "NTA\n\nIf you want to be real technical about it, they both cooked dinner, but you're totally right that J's wife did most of the work and J doesn't get to take sole credit. It sounds like he wasn't super upset about what you said, plus he asked your opinion and you told him the honest answer.", "NTA.  You didn't create the friction, you took a side in friction that was already there. And you took the correct side.  If he paid more attention to your opinion than to his wife's then he's being an AH about that too.", "NTA and thank you! Nothing more \u201cmanly\u201d than taking credit for others work.", "It doesn\u2019t seem that deep, the way the wife was okay honey.

The amount of men who will go completely cave man over a grill/bbq and claim \u2018they cooked for the family\u2019 when all they do is turn the meat that their wife\u2019s and girlfriends have bought, prepared and seasoned/marinated is just\u2026 yeah wow. And that\u2019s not counting every single side the women has made as well. \n\nNot saying there aren\u2019t men who cook or who actually give credit where it\u2019s due, just not enough of them.", "NTA. I would have been so complimentary about everything other than the steaks to make the point. \n\n\u201cHow did you make this bread? It\u2019s delicious. Does it take long? I\u2019d like to try it myself.\u201d", "You called it the way it is.\n\nNot talking about slapping a few steaks on but a proper smoked brisket, smoked pulled pork those kind of things that takes hours is being the meat guy. \n\nCooking a steak is like 5 mins of cooking max, 5-10 mins of resting depending on size.
