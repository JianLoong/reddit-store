His nasty mother\u2019s chosen narrative intended to demean your relationship. This man chose to be disrespectful and dumb. Alongside his family. At your expense. \n\nAlso- MIL is possibly (likely) using her granddaughter as a sort of surrogate emotional channel to her own son, pushing this weird competitive dynamic under false pretense of a child\u2019s close bond with her fave uncle. MIL obviously feels threatened on some level, even if it\u2019s subconscious, because there\u2019s no other reason for her to *make a pattern* of this narrative.", "Have you told him how much this response makes you feel unheard as a spouse trying to communicate an emotional problem to the other spouse?\n\nOr conversely, have you told him for argument's sake, let's agree you *are* in fact jealous (we both know you aren't but whatever); if that is the shared joint belief then why does he think it's okay to indulge your jealousy as a joke and normalise that as a dynamic between you, niece, him and MIL? How does he not see that as something that approximates to him repeatedly, selfishly triggering you?", "It\u2019s husbands way of rug sweeping", "Yeah, I mean I normally wouldn\u2019t jump right to that but he said he loves a child more than his own wife, and that\u2019s not even supposed to be slightly concerning to OP?", "Wait is he actually Italian or is he one of those Americans who like to say they're Italian but have never stepped foot on Italian soil and pronounce everything wrong?", "OK so his mother most likely has a female relative (sister, cousin, etc) and they can\u2019t stand each other, make sure you ally yourself with that relative. That relative will make it her life\u2019s work to torture your MIL so you can at least get petty satisfaction that way! \n\nSource: Italian American with an extensive understanding of how to weaponize spite.", "No \"we Italians\" are not like this. My family is very low on teasing, my boyfriend's family from another country is way more ruthless and direct (in a funny way, not mean but it took time for me to adjust). It really depends. It is a stupid excuse.", "Then he doesn't actually see it or he's in denial.", "My new emo band name is Earplugs and Valium.", "I\u2019m glad to see someone else feels a bit of concern for the niece. Not like a threat of physical danger, but a more subtle sense of questionable social boundaries being taught.", "I dunno \"Italian Opera Scream\" sounds pretty epic to me. I'd go to that concert. \ud83e\udd18", "I'd listen to \"Italian Opera scream\" in the morning then \"Earplugs and a Valium\" at bedtime."]}
