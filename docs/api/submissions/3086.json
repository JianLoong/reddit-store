She was like 6, so she whispered it to me and said that I was the prettiest ever so her mom was wrong. \n\nI was like \ud83d\ude15 holy shit.

The grown man\u2019s relationship should not be so focused on this 8 year old - why is it? Why is an 8 year old child being compared to a full grown woman when \u201ccompeting\u201d for the love of this full grown man? It\u2019s fucking gross", "Actually, you are talking about an adult who has been oblivious to his mother's manipulation and an unhealthy dynamic that has been encouraged.   You are three days into your marriage and wishing you had discussed this before the actual wedding.  \n\nThe two of you need to talk more about his mother's attitude and it may be best to do that in a mediated (aka therapeutic) environment.   \n\nIn the meantime, it sounds like he could benefit from reading *Toxic Parents* by Susan Forward with special attention to the personal assessment section.

Wait, like six one hour lunches or \"I'm seriously considering diving through a closed window to get away\" six hours?

(Third lunch territory)\n\nThis whole thing is weird...man,  that poor kid too. It'd be one thing if she asked that, kids worry about their place in their families amidst change but MIL interjecting that anxiety into her 8 year old mind is messed up. Normally you'd say \"I love you both very much!\" cause... y'know, love is not a competition. \n\nPoor you for being accused of being jealous (probably the goal of this chaos)...feels less like jealousy and more like a profound WTF. Shit like this will make it so much harder for you to build a bond with niece too, which is unfair to all of you. I mean, your husband wants you two to get along, doesn't he?", "Good luck. I wish you the best.", "I'm also Italian, and I agree with you."]}
