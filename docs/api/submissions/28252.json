I don't even understand the point of visiting your girlfriend's kid.", "You know what you won\u2019t find a card for in Hallmark? Grandfather\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s adult child. Because that isn\u2019t a relative. It\u2019s barely an acquaintance. This is not a relationship that requires bringing the kids who don\u2019t know her whatsoever. NTA", "NTA- I wouldn\u2019t take my kids to visit a dying person they don\u2019t know. With that said, are you planning on taking the children to the funeral once the person passes? If so than it\u2019s important to have age appropriate conversations about death. You would be surprised that kids don\u2019t have to be traumatized but death but be taught that it\u2019s a normal process of life", "NTA. I was about 4 years old when my parents took me to see relatives with young boy who  I'd never met before who was dying of cancer. He looked sick, frail, barely had the energy to talk. I had nightmares about that for years, not just the sick kid (which was a new experience, kids can die!), the whole atmosphere of that family home was intense.", "NTA at all.  My dad had cancer twice and the second time it killed him.  I spent a lot of time between 9-12 in oncology wards and they are absolutely not somewhere to take children unless it's close family.  I'm sorry, this sounds like a really poorly thought out idea by your dad.  Having little kids meet someone for the first time who's in that condition would be disturbing.  No way in hell I'd take my kids.", "NTA. A photo is not worth giving children trauma. You showing up to pay your respects should be enough.", "NTA, for children as young as yours to visit a person in the late stages of cancer is traumatic.  It is traumatic for everyone as I watch my dad die from cancer. What is the purpose of them having your kids in a photo other than they have told people that they have a wonderful, blended family.  Keep you kids away.", "NTA - your children are not someone else\u2019s Prozac, dying or no. They would get zero value over meeting someone they don\u2019t know who is dying and it may be disturbing to them. Even worse if it\u2019s a photo op. You barely know this person.\n\nNo is a whole sentence or \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlah blah blah meet kids blah\u201d \n\nThat doesn\u2019t work for us. \n\n\u201cBut why blah, cancer!\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t work for us, thanks for calling! -click-", "Absolutely NTA. Tell your family that you will not subject your young kids to a. this relative who is dying, and b. to the subject of dying in general as you feel they're too young.  If you get a babysitter and go visit yourselves, a different story.", "NTA", "  I", "NTA but you may be missing an opportunity.  When I was young (5-6 i think) my dad took me to see a great aunt who was dying.  I'd met her once.  He knew she'd enjoy seeing me, but that's not why he took me.  It was so my first experience with death didn't involve someone I deeply cared for.  That did (unfortunately) turn out to be a very wise decision.  (Unfortunate due to losing several family members since then).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plus kids no matter how well behaved are tiring.", "NTA but I have a question for OP.  Does the girlfriend\u2019s kid want this visit, or does someone else want it?", "NTA.  No need to confuse your kids.", "\u201cSerious illness and death is not a lesson my children should be learning at this time in their lives. Until it IS time, I will stand and carry that burden for them.\u201d \n\nIt might be nice to share some photos and videos of your kids with them while you are visiting. Maybe even take a framed one for them to keep?\n\nETA: NTA. PLEASE continue to guard the innocence and well-being of your kids!", "Dad's partners kid. Not my girlfriends kid. My wife would definitely think I'm the AH if it was my girlfriends kid.", "This!", "No they wouldn't be going to the funeral either. The only reason I would is for support for my dad and his partner. I barely know them. Met them a handful of times at family gatherings.", "My dad had cancer and I spent a lot of time in the hospital with him as a kid.  The only things I learned about were misery and suffering.  I understand what you're saying, but having little kids meet a terminal cancer patient with days to live (skeletal,with sunken eyes and cheeks) just doesn't sound like the right opportunity.", "Oh, hahahahahaha.  Yeah, that's a whole different can of worms to open.  And still NTA.", "Im stumped about what kind of photo op are they looking for?  A pretend family for someone terminally ill?      NTA.  Your kids aren\u2019t props.", "NTA.\n\nYour kids don't know this person, they've likely had more interactions with the person who delivers your mail. You said its really just a photo op with the kids, so who's this photo for and why is it such a big deal? Personally, I'd say no to this whole idea. It doesn't even sound like you yourself are close to this person either.", "Nta it would be different if the kids actually had a relationship with them and they were auntie or uncle but why in the world would you take kids any age to visit a dying person that\u2019s just weird imo", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for what they are going through, but what is good for them, is not good for you or yours, so don't do it.", "NTA. Please don't risk traumatizing your children. You never know what they might see or hear and misunderstand, then remember for years. I have memories of my great-grandmother in a nursing home that upset me for years.\n\nThe needs of your children have to come first. And nobody's photo op needs to be your priority at all. Especially someone not related to you at all.", "NTA, hard pass on that.  Your kids don't need to do that, they don't know this person.", "NTA", "NTA. Just go by yourself. That is no place for kids who have no relationship with the ill person.", "Happy cake day"]}
