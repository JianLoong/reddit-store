Very bizarre reaction on his end bordering on inappropriately controlling.", "NTA, Jesus I spend more a week on drinks and candy imagine getting mad at spending a dollar a week on something that makes you happy.", "INFO: Does he know anyone with a gambling addiction? Could he be afraid of something along those lines?", "NTA - it sounds like you're spending your money, doesn't sound like you have a gambling problem, and it's not like you're hiding it from your partner. Like you said, if you bought $5 of coffee a week, it wouldn't be an issue.", "You spend $1 a week on something that makes you happy & he has a problem with it. WOW! May poetic justice make you a winner & then your new fantasy can be  finding a better partner. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's a dollar. Maybe if you were literally counting change for gas or something, then it could warrant some anger. Otherwise, it's a dollar a week.\n\nI, myself, don't like the lottery, but it's not like you're throwing hundreds down the drain.", "NTA\nAs you said, it's a small sum and unless a child or pet goes hungry because of that, absolutely none of his business.", "I bet he\u2019s fun at parties. \nYou\u2019re not addicted to gambling, no one is doing without because you buy a lottery ticket every week. \nSome people put more that that in the church collection plate every week, now that is a waste of money. \nIgnore him. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI imagine your job brings in enough for you to spend $52/year of your own money on buying tickets, so I'm not sure what your husband is on about.  You don't have a gambling problem and it brings you a little weekly joy, so he should just stop with this.\n\nI hope you hit it big one day.    :)", "Unless the two of you can only afford living on ramen noodles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, seven days a week, definitely NTA. You are not spending $1 on a lottery ticket. You are investing in the enjoyment you feel for a few minutes daydreaming winning the big prize.\n\nOP, if you ever win a largish amount of money, make sure you keep all of the post-tax amount for yourself and spend it as you wish.", "NTA\n\nSeems like quite the overreaction there.", "Seriously your treat to yourself is about $50 a year and he\u2019s upset? I hate ppl that think others don\u2019t deserve anything special bc MoNEy. With that logic only ppl who don\u2019t need the lottery money should win.", "NTA.\n\nLike you said, at most you are going to spend $52/year. If you bought a candy bar at the checkout or you got a Starbucks latte on the way home, it would be way more. \n\nAre finances that tight your husband needs to worry about $52/year for something that brings you enjoyment?", "I think it's fun to spend a little while fantasizing about what happens when you win, and that rather loses its lustre if you didn't get a ticket.  Your husband is being silly.  He plainly doesn't have an actual objection to the lottery, since you have a tradition about getting a special ticket for birthdays.\n\nNTA", "NTA, another person mentioned he may know someone with an addiction, so maybe talk to him in a calm moment about why that was such a big deal for him. But seriously, $1 a week is nothing. My wife and I sometimes do this when the jackpots get high. We talk about what we would do with the money, how we would quit our jobs, etc. The entertainment value is extremely high for that $2.", "NTA  \nIt's your dollar to throw away if you want to. I'm so petty and wary of controlling partners (because of a past relationship) I'd start tearing up dollar bills and leave them on top of the trash where he could see them once a week and I could say, \"no, THIS is throwing a dollar in the trash\".", "NTA.\n\nThere's nothing irrational here. You are not mistaken about the odds of winning. You are just throwing away $1 on something that amuses you. Ask your bf if he has ever seen a movie in a cinema, instead of waiting for it to be on netflix, or bought a book instead of borrowing it from a library, or bought a work of art instead of being content looking at a blank wall. Why bother travelling to the Grand Canyon when you can just see pictures of it online? Why eat at a restaurant when you can cook beans and rice at home?", "NTA. If that's all you are spending on the tickets, it's a harmless fun. You are right, your Starbucks habit is much more expensive, he is just being a killjoy.", "NTA.\n\nI agree it's a *complete* waste of money (on a \"personal utility\" level).  I agree it's a really dangerous thing for *some* people to do.\n\nBut I *also* agree that it's possible to do it as pure entertainment, with no serious expectation of winning, and to have control over it, able to keep your total costs very low.  And that certainly looks like how it works out for you.\n\nAlso: that money often goes towards deserving things.  Like, in my state, it funds programs that benefit elderly citizens.  Perfectly good reason to put money into it even without the expectation of any return.\n\nMy own strategy is to just think about how astronomically low the odds are, and realize that spending a buck on it isn't the difference between \"low chance\" and \"no chance\", but two different low chances.  You *can* win without playing at all -- you could find, or be gifted, a winning ticket.  Thinking about it that way, I'm not tempted to ever play, not even slightly.  (It also helps that I have the philosophy that I will never willingly take a fair bet, only one stacked in my favor.  And I know enough math to know this isn't stacked in my favor.)\n\nBut yeah, spending $52 a year on lottery tickets is actually *better* than spending $52 a year on microtransactions in mobile games, because the lottery is often used to fund worthwhile things.\n\n(EDIT: To be clear, the reason for that penultimate paragraph is to show that I \"should\" be on your significant something-or-other's side, but I'm not.)", "NTA\n\nYour husband is right that it's a waste of money, but his behavior was too much, and frankly if it makes you happy then it's $1 well spent.", "NAH. You're both right. You *are* throwing your money away but enjoying it in the process without spending life altering sums of money.

He lost 75% of his cost.  My mom used to buy hundreds of dollars of lottery tickets as stocking stuffers every year for Christmas, for like 15 years straight.  I was the biggest winner ever at $500 once.  There's no way she broke even.\n\nLottery is a great way to lose a lot of money.
