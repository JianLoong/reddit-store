You are not mistaken about the odds of winning. You are just throwing away $1 on something that amuses you.

I agree it's a really dangerous thing for *some* people to do.\n\nBut I *also* agree that it's possible to do it as pure entertainment, with no serious expectation of winning, and to have control over it, able to keep your total costs very low.  And that certainly looks like how it works out for you.\n\nAlso: that money often goes towards deserving things.  Like, in my state, it funds programs that benefit elderly citizens.  Perfectly good reason to put money into it even without the expectation of any return.\n\nMy own strategy is to just think about how astronomically low the odds are, and realize that spending a buck on it isn't the difference between \"low chance\" and \"no chance\", but two different low chances.  You *can* win without playing at all -- you could find, or be gifted, a winning ticket.  Thinking about it that way, I'm not tempted to ever play, not even slightly.  (It also helps that I have the philosophy that I will never willingly take a fair bet, only one stacked in my favor.  And I know enough math to know this isn't stacked in my favor.)\n\nBut yeah, spending $52 a year on lottery tickets is actually *better* than spending $52 a year on microtransactions in mobile games, because the lottery is often used to fund worthwhile things.\n\n(EDIT: To be clear, the reason for that penultimate paragraph is to show that I \"should\" be on your significant something-or-other's side, but I'm not.)", "NTA\n\nYour husband is right that it's a waste of money, but his behavior was too much, and frankly if it makes you happy then it's $1 well spent.", "NAH.

That is controlling. It isn't much money at all.", "I'm waaay up on lotto winnings, normally get around $60-80 per ticket so It's going to be a few years before I 'lose' money.", "He's probably just one of those dudes who thinks he's some sort of enlightened genius for knowing that the lottery isn't a viable way to make money \n\nAlso I literally can't imagine getting on someone's case for a $1/week habit. \n\nTell him to get fucked, or better yet, he's begging to be smoked in an argument next time he wastes $5 on something. Make him regret it!", "Shoot!  When we walk by the lottery stand at the grocery store, I remind my hubs to buy tickets.  And not $1 either.  Get the whole $20 card baby!  Like you said, sometimes that fantasy of winning the lottery is the best pick me up.  I even have a couple of floor plans for a dream house sitting in my email.  Just in case!", "I\u2019m retired now, but remember many weeks where the dream was what got me through.", "NTA. If you want to pay the State's voluntary tax its completely up to you. I hope you win something nice some day.", "NTA. It\u2019s part of the entertainment budget as far as I\u2019m concerned. Cheaper than a movie.", "NTA - it's not like it's a habit or you're putting more into it than you can afford to lose. And right now, it's nice to have that little dream of winning a life changing amount. I imagine if you'd won the jackpot he wouldn't have an issue with it.", "Is he always that controlling. It's not his business if yiu want to spend a dollar on the lottery. \n\nNta\nHe is the AH.", "Not going to give a judgement but for some people it has nothing to do with the amount spent but that you have a consistent gambling habit- that can be a real dealbreaker. Occassional birthday bets vs \u201cEverytime I shop I get a lotto\u201d are very different levels of gambling addiction. And just so you are aware, the joy/hope you get is the addiction part! A lot of people in replies seem oblivious to this, and in fact list it as a \u201cpro\u201d of gambling.\n\nSounds like it would only be an actual threat/issue if you had more money though. He shouldn\u2019t have gone off in any way about it.", "NTA. You're not a gambling addict. You're not choosing lottery tickets over buying food for your family. You are buying A lottery ticket for shits and giggles. You are allowed to treat yourself. Hell, I spend more than that on my weekly candy bar treat.", "NTA. No context if these explosive criticisms from your husband is common or not. If they are this is a red flag; in being over-bearing and controlling.", "NTA.", "right- in my state, lottery funds support education, which is something sorely needed considering the absolute lack of funding for schools here and the abysmal teacher pay (top 5 worst states for teachers, yay!)", "I used to work with lottery, while I hate it with every fiber of my being I say NTA as you\u2019re not throwing away much on it. That said, don\u2019t start scratch offs as they don\u2019t have great odds for payoff either. Check your states games and see if you have a Daily Cash 5 game that plays, you have way better odds on those.", "Also think OP is NTA. But just wanted to say you can have the same fantasies without actually buying any tickets, and your chances at winning are about the same.", "Its a little treat you puck up, nothing wrong with that. After all, you need to be in it to win it.\n\nDoes he drink or smoke? If he does, he is wasting more money than you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Spending that amount over a year on the feelings of hope and pleasure? You carry on. And good luck :)", "NTA When you win, calculate all the weeks you played and give him that. Tell him that is his share.", "While I understand being wary around addictive actions such as gambling, you're not showing any signs of being an addict. You're not spending more $ than you can afford. If you want to spend a dollar on the experience of \"seeing if you can win the lottery,\" then you're buying an experience, not throwing the dollar away. As long as you are aware of what you're doing and willing to stop if it becomes addictive, I don't see a problem with it.  On the other hand, I do think you need to discuss this with your partner and see what his hang-up with this is. NTA.", "I mean, I'd start playing a lottery that puts a portion of the proceeds to charity. I know texas has one, I don't know about the area where you live. Make him look like more of an asshole than he already is. \"This is going to scholarships for underprivileged kids; what are you doing with *your* weekly indulgence purchase?\" \n\nI promise you that he has something he buys at least once a week with no purpose but making him a bit happier. If he doesn't shut up, find out what it is and lean on it. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n$1 dramatically increases your chances of winning over $0.\n\nView the lottery as a tax on people who are bad in math.  Just decide to which degree you're bad at it :)", "NTA my son had a math assignment on the lottery in which he was supposed to persuade a friend to stop playing the lotto. He did all the maths bit correctly but explained to the \"friend\" that while it's a waste of money it's no worse than buying a coffee or any other small purchase.  The teacher wasn't impressed but I was."]}
