Common courtesy and all. Lol", "You\u2019re right. Sometimes I just need some reassurance, I guess.

He didn\u2019t think to warn you about his parents. Or even the house might be a bad place to meet them.", "Don't cheap out, the room size they list on the box is for turbo mode and some are rather useless for anything bigger than a bathroom on the air modes. You want at least 4 air changes per hour (ACH) and if you want it quiet you need a purifier rated for more square footage than your room.\n\nIf you find one that lists the cubic feet of air it's rated for at different settings the math is (CFM * 60) / CU ft of air in the room. If it lists the settings by percent just divide the CFM by that amount and then do the ACH calculation.\n\nIf the unit is equipped with automatic mode that's usually pretty worthless. (Mine only cracks it up to high of I far near it. Everybody that gets one does it at least once)\n\nIf you're into smart electronics being able to set a timer is nice, as is being able to control it without getting my lazy ass off the couch. I know my TV time for the night is over when the purifier kicks into turbo mode and I can't hear the TV anymore. I've also got a timer set to kick on after my roommate leaves for work so it doesn't sit around all day doing nothing. If you don't like white noise when you sleep schedule it to turn down at bedtime. It's a great reminder that it's time to put the phone down and close your eyes."]}
