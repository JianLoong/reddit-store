You\u2019re definitely not being unreasonable.

It is your wedding. This is your day, not hers. You dictate how the decorations and participants look.  So if she can't get with the program, then she is not invited.

Like does she need more support in the chest and the dress won\u2019t allow for the kind of bra she needs, or is she self conscious about her arms and wants sleeves, or something like that? Ask her to be honest about her feelings and see if there\u2019s room for some kind of compromise.

Like, because she\u2019s *co*-MOH, she feels she has to wear something slightly (?) different to stand out? \n\nMy 2 cents is that the bride and groom get to make any and all decisions related to *their* big day, not bridesmaids or MOH. If someone refuses to go along with those decisions, then they should understand if they are cut from the wedding party. Come as a guest, and wear the dress you want (unless it\u2019s silver/cream/etc etc that looks too close to a wedding gown), but just understand that YOUR feelings about MY big day aren\u2019t my biggest issue, and if you cause a fuss, you\u2019ll be asked to leave.", "I thought that too, and the second time she backed out, she seemed mad when I didn\u2019t cancel the entire thing.

I don't know why, but for some reason this is the hill she has chosen. Is she upset that she is sharing the MOH title and wants to stand out in some other way? \n\nShe really sounds like a kid who doesn't feel like they are getting enough attention at someone else's party.", "This is a red flag. She can be the centre of attention at her own wedding, not at yours.

I have ball gown that\u2019s covered in sequins that I\u2019ve worn for a couple of very formal events, and she asked to borrow it so she could wear it for her mom\u2019s wedding\u2026 I told her absolutely not.", "Just kick her out now. shes 100% going to wear something inappropriate even if you did buyher dress; I guarantee she\u2019d still show up in what she wants to wear.", "Honestly, I don't really care about the colour. I was just being cheeky. She sounds like a dick who you don't really even need in your life. Drop her from your bridal party and drop her from your friends list while you're at it. Anyone who needs to shine like that at a free party instead of wear a dress that is not only free but tailored to fit you right is a bad friend. It's just a wedding. She can have her own party another time."]}
