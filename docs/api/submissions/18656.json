She clearly is backing out on purpose and has some reason for not wanting this dress. The fact that YOU ARE PAYING makes it so strange!

Is there any chance the dress style you've picked may make her uncomfortable for some reason- too revealing in certain areas, maybe, or conflicts with a religious requirement for her? Maybe she has a severe insecurity about something that the dress might reveal and is embarrassed?
