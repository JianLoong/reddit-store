If you aren't familiar, it's a very small dog.  Last week I had to go out of town for work for 4 days and asked a friend of mine (35F) if she would be willing to dogsit for me because I can't afford to board my dog for that long.  I still offered to pay her of course, just not as much as I would have paid a boarder.  She and her family have a dog as well (rescue mutt) that my dog has met before and gets along with.  They also have a fenced-in backyard so the dogs could play outside together and get exercise.  \n\nThe day before I was supposed to come home, my friend called me but I couldn't answer because I was in a meeting.  She also sent me a bunch of texts.  Apparently, someone else's dog got loose and jumped the 5-foot chain link fence to my friend's backyard.  Both my dog and my friend's dog were outside at the time unsupervised.  My friend's husband was home for lunch and let the dogs out while he was eating.  \n\nHe heard barking and went outside and saw a dog he had never seen before fighting with their and my dog.  He was able to break up the fight and got my dog and his inside before he went back out and was able to get the other dog to run away.    Since my dog was the smallest, she got the worst of it.  He called my friend right away and told her to meet him at the emergency vet because my dog was in rough shape.  My dog ended up needing a lot of stitches and surgery for broken bones. She should recover, but the emergency vet bill was really high, almost $2,500.  My friend paid it on the spot.  I do not have pet insurance.\n\nBy the time I was able to get in touch with her, my dog was already being stitched up so I couldn't really do anything about it.  I couldn't cut my work trip short either (thanks for your compassion, boss).\n\nWhen I got home and picked up my dog, my friend was apologetic about it.  But she also brought up me paying them back for the emergency vet bill.  They tried asking other neighbors if anyone knows who the other dog belongs to, but no one knows.  My friend's husband said he had never seen that dog before.  So it's not like they can track down the owner to get payment that way.  \n\nI'll admit I probably didn't handle it well.  I told them my dog almost died and the first thing they ask about is money?  The way I look at it, it's their fault my dog got hurt in the first place because the husband left the dogs unattended outside.  I also don't have that kind of money lying around.  If I did, I would have paid for a boarder.  My friend suggested at least paying half and I told her no way.  It's their fault, not mine.  And while I appreciate that they took quick action to help my dog, it's their fault the situation happened in the first place.\n\nMy friend has been texting me since but I've been ignoring her and am thinking of just blocking her.  She was a good friend, but I can't believe she is expecting me to pay for something that was their fault.", "created_utc": 1678904939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s4udf/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_friend_back_after_my/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They asked about reimbursement when you were there to pick it up, days later, long after the fact. You\u2019re acting like that was the first message, about money.\n\nAlso, you seem to understand this was an extremely unlikely / rare event and the dogs would normally be ok in their fenced yard, and not needing to have eyes on them the entire time. \n\nOf course they would want to be paid back for the vet expenses, and them offering half reimbursement was generous.", "YTA. sorry, but emergency medical expenses are very much your responsibility as a pet owner.\n\nalso there\u2019s a revealing tendency that you consistently point out your dog\u2019s purebred status while referring to hers as a \u201cmutt.\u201d while that\u2019s an accurate statement, i think it indicates something deeper in your post.\n\nif the husband had been outside at the time, would you still be refusing to pay? the dog could just have easily jumped the fence and attacked, it literally takes less than a second (ask me how i know).", "YTA\n\nYour dog getting attacked wasn't their fault.

It was not their fault.\n\nThey didn't do anything wrong. Letting a dog unattended in a fenced yard is not an irresponsible behaviour. The loose dog's owner was 100% at faults here, not your friend.\n\n... if you don't have money to get your pet the emergency medical attention they need, or even boarding, you probably shouldn't have a pet to start with. They are expensive and deserve better than a owner that will cut corners with their care because they can't affort it.", "YTA\n\n>it's their fault the situation happened in the first place.\n\nIs it really? The dog was outside in a fenced area.  Even if the husband were outside with the dogs, the outcome could well have been the same. I would have thought that the fault is with the owner of the dog that jumped the fence.\n\nIt's your dog, and your vet bill. I'm sorry, the situation sucks, but you took a risk not insuring the dog. I don't think your friend did anything wrong.", "YTA\n\nYou need to pay the bill, the entire bill, and also: if you cannot afford to care for a dog, which includes savings for emergencies like these, you shouldn't own a pet in the first place.\n\nThis could have happened at any time, and blaming your friend is a shitty thing to do. \n\nAnd what, exactly, does this mean? \n\n\"By the time I was able to get in touch with her, my dog was already being stitched up so I couldn't really do anything about it.\"\n\nDoes that mean if it had happened in your presence, you would have let your own dog die because you couldn't afford to pay for her teatment???", "YTA \nWhat would you have done differently if you had been able to answer the phone, have your dog put down?  Be responsible for your pet, your friend did the right thing and you need to pay her back.

Your later statement about not having \" . . . that kind of money lying around.\" is another indicator that I'm curious to get more info about the meaning of.\n\nYour friend did the best she could under the circumstances. You were unavailable so they acted reasonably with respect to your beloved pet. I don't see this as \"their fault.\" It's the fault of the other dog and its absent owner.

If you aren\u2019t willing to pay for a kennel (where your dog will get nonstop supervision) or pet insurance, or your dog\u2019s vet bill then you shouldn\u2019t have a dog. Your friends let the dog in the backyard, you would have done the same thing. They made sure your dog got the immediate care they needed. Be thankful, and pay them back.

YTA.\n\nThis could have happened even if supervised.\n\n It happened to me once while my dog was on a leash. A neighbors dog came over and started to resource guard me (I think?), staring at my dog, prevented me from walking away with my dog. I tried to get back inside but then the dog attacked mine and there was very little I could do. I certainly wouldn't expect a friend to break up a dog fight and potentially get bit for my dog. \n\nDid you know they let their dog out unsupervised? (I do the same thing with mine as we have a fence - I lived somewhere else when the attack happened) Did you explicitly tell them that they couldn't? A strange dog came in their fenced in yard - certainly not their fault. Your dog, your responsibility. They did you a favor by watching your dog and getting proper care for it, paying for it themselves. Pay them back.", "Don't be surprised if they take you to court to get their money back and you end up paying their lawyer fees as well as the vets fees. YTA", "YTA.\n\nThe sitter's husband did nothing wrong. He was home eating lunch and let the dogs out to play. When you say \"unsupervised\", are you implying that if you were there you would have stayed outside with your dog the entire time? Bullshit. It's nobody's fault. His actions saved your dog's life. \n\nYou failed to answer the phone several times, so you didn't play a part in the decision-making... but what would you have said? \"No, that's too much money, don't save his life?\" Of course not. So suck it up and pay them back. \n\nFile a police report and ask neighbors who might have cameras to check for footage. The attacking dog isn't a ghost, you can find it if you try. And aside from forcing the owner to pay, you might just save other dogs from being attacked.", "YTA - and a shit dog owner. Your dog isn\u2019t insured and you can\u2019t afford to pay for a boarder for 4 days that isn\u2019t a long stay. You should 100% be paying your friend back. What was the plan if your dog ever got hurt just have it put down?", "YTA, this is absolutely your responsibility for being cheap about dog insurance and dog care.", "YTA for buying a purebred dog and not having insurance.\n\nYou tried being a cheapskate and getting cheap dog care from a friend (not an insured, registered kennel) so any costs from accidents are on you, particularly one they couldn't have prevented. \n\nAs others have said, the damage can be done in seconds, even if the husband was in the yard it might not have prevented your dog getting so hurt.", "YTA. It's a huge amount of money and they even offered to pay half of it. I am sorry that your dog was attacked, I can understand your anger. I would be angry too if I see my dog in such a condition but in that range filled moment it is difficult to rationalise the situation. They did the right thing by taking your dog to the vet and not thinking about money. Things like these are out of our control. They did the best they could, it is wrong to blame them for it especially when it isn't intentional. Their dog was also involved in this, I doubt anyone would deliberately do this to their own beloved pet.", "YTA. It\u2019s not unreasonable to allow dogs to play unsupervised in a fenced yard. \n\nIf you \u201cdon\u2019t have that kind of money lying around\u201d, you should understand why your friend was anxious to get her generous, short-term payment back.\n\nAlso, since you want to play the blame game, the financial impact of this situation on everyone involved wouldn\u2019t be nearly as bad if you had pet insurance.", "YTA.\n\n1. your dog. your responsibility.\n2. a responsible pet owner would have pet insurance. \n3. it is perfectly reasonable to expect that the dogs would be safe in a fenced in yard.

You need to pay your friend back. Don\u2019t be AH. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have the money or not. Figure it out. When people pet sit other animals it\u2019s up to the owner to pay for any vet bills. This was an accident. They can\u2019t watch your dog 24/7. Who would have predicted another dog jumping the fence. Would you rather they put your dog down?", "YTA. Your dog was attacked while it was in a fenced back yard. Do you honestly expect someone to physically watch your dog the entire time it's in a fenced yard? I highly doubt the attack could have been prevented since a random dog jumped the fence and attacked the dogs. You should be thankful that your friend acted quickly and took your dog to the vet. Your friend was more than kind enough to offer to split the bill with you. You are the asshole, and it just sounds like you are trying to get away with not paying.", "YTA. your friend stepped in to break up a dog fight, which is dangerous. it's a fenced in yard, so they had every right to expect that leaving the dogs alone would be safe as long as they were getting along. the way it sounds, you would have just let the dog bleed instead of getting it stitches because you don't want to pay for it? im not understanding. you'd have to pay the money either way. they took care of your dog, protected her from a large strange aggressive dog, and got her medical attention when something went wrong. any of this could've happened at a boarding facility. you paid less for more attentive one-on-one care. i hope you're not like this to your friends all the time and you're just feeling emotional about your pet. i hope your dog recovers well \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "YTA. It's not unusual to have dogs unsupervised in a fenced back yard. It's not your friend's fault that a strange dog jumped the fence and attacked the dogs.

So paying half actually would be understandable here", "YTA This could have happened while in your care as well. How was your friend and her husband to anticipate a strange dog jumping the fence and attacking? At least they got your dog to the emergency vet and saved it's life. You need to pay them back.", "Yta this isn't a case of neglect.  This could *easily* have happened when you were home.", "YTA.

AND SHE EVEN OFFERED TO TAKE HALF. maybe it's not enough to justify trying to take you to court, but if the friend has the means to, she definitely should. \n\nif the dog got hurt under your watch (which it 100% can because this was a freak accident) would you just let it die? seems like you would. you shouldn\u2019t be having any pets.", "Yes, you are an asshole.

I suggest you pay now so you don't end up in small claims court and lose the friendship entirely.", "YTA. Unplanned emergencies are part of owning a dog. Leaving a dog unattended for a few minutes in a fenced back yard isn\u2019t negligence. It was an accident that was not your friend\u2019s fault.

Last week I had to go out of town for work for 4 days and asked a friend of mine (35F) if she would be willing to dogsit for me because I can't afford to board my dog for that long.  I still offered to pay her of course, just not as much as I would have paid a boarder.  She and her family have a dog as well (rescue mutt) that my dog has met before and gets along with.  They also have a fenced-in backyard so the dogs could play outside together and get exercise.  \n\nThe day before I was supposed to come home, my friend called me but I couldn't answer because I was in a meeting.  She also sent me a bunch of texts.  Apparently, someone else's dog got loose and jumped the 5-foot chain link fence to my friend's backyard.  Both my dog and my friend's dog were outside at the time unsupervised.  My friend's husband was home for lunch and let the dogs out while he was eating.  \n\nHe heard barking and went outside and saw a dog he had never seen before fighting with their and my dog.  He was able to break up the fight and got my dog and his inside before he went back out and was able to get the other dog to run away.    Since my dog was the smallest, she got the worst of it.  He called my friend right away and told her to meet him at the emergency vet because my dog was in rough shape.  My dog ended up needing a lot of stitches and surgery for broken bones. She should recover, but the emergency vet bill was really high, almost $2,500.  My friend paid it on the spot.  I do not have pet insurance.\n\nBy the time I was able to get in touch with her, my dog was already being stitched up so I couldn't really do anything about it.  I couldn't cut my work trip short either (thanks for your compassion, boss).\n\nWhen I got home and picked up my dog, my friend was apologetic about it.  But she also brought up me paying them back for the emergency vet bill.  They tried asking other neighbors if anyone knows who the other dog belongs to, but no one knows.  My friend's husband said he had never seen that dog before.  So it's not like they can track down the owner to get payment that way.  \n\nI'll admit I probably didn't handle it well.  I told them my dog almost died and the first thing they ask about is money?  The way I look at it, it's their fault my dog got hurt in the first place because the husband left the dogs unattended outside.  I also don't have that kind of money lying around.  If I did, I would have paid for a boarder.  My friend suggested at least paying half and I told her no way.  It's their fault, not mine.  And while I appreciate that they took quick action to help my dog, it's their fault the situation happened in the first place.\n\nMy friend has been texting me since but I've been ignoring her and am thinking of just blocking her.  She was a good friend, but I can't believe she is expecting me to pay for something that was their fault.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA, though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for your friends to help since the dog was in their care. It may not be their fault, but it was their responsibility to keep the dog safe, so some sort of split makes sense to me given it was such a freak thing.", "YTA. Should she have let your dog die because she couldn\u2019t get in touch with you? You should consider suing the owner of the dog that jumped the fence and attacked your dog.", "YTA. Pay for your damn dog. Your friend did everything they could to save them and make sure they were okay.", "Wow. I hope they never speak to you again (after you pay them the money they are absolutely due). YTA.", "YTA", "YTA, your pet = your bill.", "YTA- my parents have an invisible fence and I\u2019d find it a huge waste of time if they just sat outside all day making sure nothing random happens. The point of the fence is you don\u2019t have to supervise constantly", "YTA and I presume a lesson has been learned about ever doing you a favor, hopefully they spread that lesson to your other friends.", "YTA.  This is a great way to destroy a friendship.  Your friend and her husband did the right thing by rushing the dogs to the vet and taking care of the situation.  The injury was in no way their fault.  Even if the husband had been outside there is no guarantee the outcome would have been different.  Dogs that are so aggressive that they\u2019d jump a fence to get another dog are not likely to avoid that action just because a human in standing in the yard.  This is just an unfortunate situation but you should be fronting the vet costs for YOUR dog.  Plenty of us have animals and if we don\u2019t have the emergency funds immediately available we use credit to cover the costs and pay it off later.  Grow up, pay your friend, and consider pet insurance.", "YTA. I\u2019m a dog owner myself. It is not your friends fault this happened. It was above and beyond that your friends rushed your dog to the ER and even paid the initial vet bill and you need to work towards paying them back. This could have just as easily have happened when you take your dog for a walk or at a boarding facility. \n\nWe usually use Rover when we go out of town and it is very clear in all agreements that we are responsible for all vet care if something were to happen. \n\nYou owe your friends money and a very big apology.", "YTA\nYour friend immediately paid the vet bills for your dog without a second thought.\nEven if you don\u2019t have that kind of money around, you could still work out a small payment to your friend every month until you paid all the bill.\nMedical emergency is the responsibility of the owner.", "YTA it wasn't their fault, it's your dog, you need to pay up.  \n\nMaybe you can pay them back over time.", "YTA. It wasn't their fault in any way. This was a random event that no one could have planned for. Take care of the bill and thank your friends for floating the money. Next time just board your dog.", "YTA. Would you have preferred she let your dog die when she couldn't get a hold of you? Don't make her sue you for it cuz I'm certain you'll lose. (Which could end up way more expensive than you just paying the bill). They won't be at fault because it was your yard (which you're responsible for too). Maybe you should've installed a taller fence? We can play the blame game all day. It is reasonable to assume your backyard would've been safe,  it's not like they let it run wild and it got hit by a car. It was a freak situation but they shouldn't bear the cost. Your dog,  your responsibility. Even if you board a dog and a medical emergency happens you'll be on the hook for the vet services. \n\nDo your best to find the owner of the dog that attacked and try to recoup the cost but pay your friend back ASAP.", "YTA. \n\nYour dog, your responsibility. \n\nA boarder would have insurance in place to cover these sort of incidents. You took a risk with your friend rather than a boarder, and it is on you to pay them back.\n\nThw way you compare your dogs and fail to mention how theirs fared (in your post) is very telling. Pay them back in instalments, but pay them back.", "YTA. It was an accident and your friends made sure your dog got proper medical attention. Would you feel better if they left it to die? What would you have done if you were able to answer the phone immediately? Tell them to euthanize? Seriously? I would make a payment plan.", "YTA. It is not their fault. They did not leave him unattended, they simply let them outside into a fenced-in yard. I've had dogs my whole life and 90% of people are not going to watch the entire time that their dog is outside in a fenced-in yard. \n\nIt's a shitting situation and I'm glad your dog is okay but you absolutely need to pay them back. Her husband did EVERYTHING he could to make sure your dog was okay, quickly jumping into action, immediately paying the vet bill, and making sure you knew ASAP. You need to apologize and pay them back for the entire bill. Just set up a payment plan where you send them a set amount every month.", "YTA. Get insurance for your dog. Or better yet, don't buy a dog if you can't afford to board it or pay vet bills. You owe them the money for the vet bill. If they take you to court they will win and you'll have to pay filing fees. You're also the AH for calling there dog a mutt like it's  a bad thing. Some of the best dogs I've met are mutts. Puppy mills are responsible for the majority of purebred dogs. Look into that and then decide if your breed is superior. The deplorable conditions and over breeding makes unhealthy pups with genetic problems.", "YTA I would include Ex friend in that because if I was your friend no chance I\u2019d want to be friends with you", "YTA. You're the owner, it's your responsibility to cover vet bills.\n\nPart of owning pets is taking responsibility for your pets vet bills.\n\nThey did you a favour. They didn't purposefully put your dog in danger, they put the dogs out into a fenced in property. The other dog jumped the fence. It could have easily happened had you been the one supervising the dogs.\n\nPay your friend back, and pay her for the time she spent dog watching.", "YTA It was a fenced in backyard and your friends husband risked his own health and safety to save your dog. I also have a purebred dog, I also don\u2019t pay for pet insurance, but you know what I do? I put aside money every month specifically for my dog and any medical expenses he could have. He\u2019s 2.5 now and I wouldn\u2019t even blink to pay $2500 if he was injured because I\u2019ve been putting money aside since he was a puppy. That is your responsibility as a pet owner to either have insurance or have money set aside for medical emergencies, and if you can\u2019t do either then you can\u2019t afford a pet. Apologize to your friend and pay them back, then take a hard look in the mirror and ask yourself if your dog is your pet or your accessory.", "YTA. Pay them back, in installments if you don't have the money right now. Also, you own a $2,000 dog and you can't afford boarding, insurance or emergency vet bills? Your financial decisions...need some work.", "YTA\n\nYou have a pet but don\u2019t have money in case something happens to your pet and also don\u2019t have insurance? Why do you have a pet then? Letting dogs out for a little while someone is eating lunch inside is not negligent and not their fault. Keep fucking around and your friends (if you will even have any left) are never going to do any favors for you. I hope your friends who were nice enough to help you out spread the word", "YTA.\n\nIt's not their fault a random dog jumped the fence and attacked your dog and theirs. You seem to glance over that part. They rushed your dog to the emergency vet and immediately paid a ridiculous amount of money so that you'd still have a dog to come home to.", "YTA. You should apologize to your friend for your reaction and offer to figure out how to pay her back, even on an installment plan. Frankly, you were massively lucky that they had that much to spare - some people wouldn't have had access to the money, and some might not have been willing to spend it without  knowing for sure they'd be paid back.", "Yta", "YTA for not having pet insurance.", "Wow dude YTA. I have a small dog who was recently attacked while my friend (who was doing me a favor) was taking her for a walk. I ended up paying an arm and a leg for the vet bill but i would NEVER make my friend pay. You need to grow up. Your dog got hurt, you pay for it.", "YTA. You need to pay them back. They took on your dog as a favor-  unexpected things happen often. Even if he was outside watching them, it would\u2019ve taken an outsider dog seconds to injury your dog. \n\nAlso even more YTA- you have a purebred dog but can\u2019t afford it insurance or a boarding home. Then you call your friends dog a \u2018mutt\u2019, you could say that they have a dog\u2026. breed makes no difference- just like race.", "YTA. This was not their fault. They tried to call you and you did not respond. You should be paying this. What would you have preferred -- they tell the vet to put your dog down? They saved his life!", "YTA they looked after your dog and it was a freak accident, NOT them making a mistake or being negligent. You\u2019re an irresponsible dog owner for not having insurance and not willing to pay YOUR dogs bill. You had the money to buy a purebred dog, so you should have the money to look after it", "YTA, I'm afraid.  I know you're worried about the puppy (dog tax, please!) but your friend has a five foot chain link fence.  It's reasonable to believe that is enough to keep dogs in and strays out.\n\nI'm so sorry your puppy got hurt but your friend and her husband did nothing wrong, in fact they did a lot to mitigate the damage by getting your dog to the vet as quickly as they did.\n\n$2500 is a lot of money, but maybe you can pay her over time?", "Have they shown you proof that another dog got into the yard? How do you know that their dogs didn\u2019t fight your dog and they didn\u2019t want to admit it? Do they have cameras? What happened to the other dog?", "It is not their fault and the courts would agree. Both your dog and their dog were within the confines of a fenced yard. Your dog sitters have done nothing wrong. It is your dog you owe them full redress of 2500. I hope they take you to court. You are an ungrateful asshole", "YTA. Was the yard fenced? Why would you even point out that the dogs were left outside unattended since you mention that the yard was fenced? That's one of the whole points of fencing the yard in the first place, so that you can leave your dog unattended outside. \n\nIf it was your friends' dog that attacked yours you'd have a leg to stand on but it wasn't. This isn't their fault, they did you a favor by watching the dog in the first place and for paying for your dog's medical care without hesitating, and you're repaying them by blaming them for an unfortunate situation that was out of your control and leaving them holding the bill. Pay your friends back what you owe them and apologize for being an asshole.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will make the rounds, and next time someone dogsits for you they will wait with any vet visits until you ANSWER your phone and agree to cover it. Not good for your dog.", "YTA they are doing you a favor they should not be responsible for the vet bill if you cant afford it do the right thing and tell them.. setup a payment plan with whatever you can afford instead of dodging them  like a coward", "YTA - I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t be feeling how you\u2019re feeling right now if that was any of my pups, so I completely understand, but emergency vet bills are your responsibility.  This was a random act. they didn\u2019t do this on purpose, perhaps they were not as diligent as you would have been, but they acted immediately to provide care for your dog and sought medical care.  What did you expect them to do when you were unreachable?\n\nThey should have handled the money situation differently, it would have been better to allow you some time to decompress with your dog.  Then again, they may not be able to swing this kind of cost either, and it\u2019s not their dog.  I think you\u2019re feeling all of the adrenaline and emotions of the event and I hope after some time, you guys can move forward and come to an agreement, them offering to cover half was pretty reasonable to me.  It sounds like you were good enough friends to trust them with your little guy and from all accounts this was a random event.  \n\nThis totally sucks for you and your pup, I\u2019m sorry.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery.", "YTA, if you didn\u2019t have $2,500 laying around what would you have done if this happened on your watch? Not brought your dog to the vet? Would you have rather they do that? Because they absolutely could have. Expenses for your dog is your responsibility and not theirs. What happened was not their fault. You\u2019re a terrible \u201cfriend\u201d and I hope they take legal action against you to get reimbursed.", "Wow\u2026just wow. \n\nYTA, in a major way here. Life happens. That attack could have happened at any time and at any place. \n\nThey were nice enough to take tour dog to the vet and front the cash and this is how you treat them? Your actions are deplorable. Its a literal slap in the face to your friend. And you had the nerve to be all high and mighty when they requested money back?!\n\nPay them back and apologize. Period. This is NOT how you treat your friends.", "YTA they were kind enough to pay out of pocket not questions asked to treat your dog and now you don\u2019t want to compensate them?? What is wrong with you , you can\u2019t say this way their fault a random street dog jumped the fence they can\u2019t control that and even if he was outside at the time there\u2019s no guarantee that he could of mitigated the injury\u2019s your tiny little dog.", "YTA", "YTA - It\u2019s not like their dog attacked yours! Putting a dog in the backyard to play is also not a crime. Backyards typically have fencing and if another dog got in that is no one\u2019s fault. \n\nPay back your friend you A.", "YTA big time. It was not remotely their fault. Your dog and their dog was in their SECURED back yard when another dog jumped the fence and attacked. Even if someone was outside in the backyard, it would not have prevented the attack and injury. It happens too fast. \n\nNot only do you owe them the FULL vet bill, you owe them money for boarding your dog. Have the fucking decency to at least pay them the vet bill, even if you have to do it bit by bit or take a loan out\u2026 and from now on, don\u2019t go anywhere out of town without your dog since you want to hold the world responsible for your dog and not yourself. \n\nI truly hope if you don\u2019t pay your friend back that they sue you and drop you and I hope this is a wake up call to GET PET INSURANCE. You\u2019re a neglectful owner by not having it for this reason alone.", "I was on the fence about this one but I agree with others argument. YTA", "YTA. You've got an uninsured expensive dog breed. You used a lot of words to say \"I can't afford the fashion accessory I got\". \n\nA freak accident that couldn't have been foreseen occurred, and you're inability to financially cover it is 100% on you.\n\nWith any luck your friends consider this a lesson learned and cut you off because you've shown a myriad if poor Traits in a few paragraphs.", "YTA, this is what you opted out of by not paying to board your dog. You cheaped out and this is the consequence. The boarding place would've paid for this off insurance. You chose not to have this luxury, now pay the price.", "YTA If YOU dont haven an insurance its your problem. \n\nWould you be happier if they didnt go the vet? \n\nHow was it her fault?", "YTA 100% - your friend did nothing wrong. She was doing you a favor and YOUR dog was injured by a third party. YOU are responsible for paying YOUR dog's vet bills.", "YTA. But the neighbor who owns the dog should ultimately be approached about having their dog at large. You could have gone to a kennel. Just remember that.", "YTA. No one is at fault for an accident, but you, as the owner, are expected to pay for your own dog's care.", "YTA. It was an unexpected accident. It's not your friend's fault. \n\nIf you can't/won't pay for the expenses of owning a dog, then why bother having one? Fuck man, you act like it's easier to buy a new one than help the one you already have. Your dog deserves better. \n\nI also hope your friend takes you to court if you don't pay up.", "YTA it was a fluke occurrence that just happened to take place while she was dogsitting. This could have easily happened with you around or anyone else. That fact that she's willing to go halfs on it is good on her IMO.", "YTA. It was an unfortunate accident that resulted in the emergency visit. Keep in mind this whole scenario could have played out exactly the same with someone in the yard with the dogs. It\u2019s reasonable for them to ask for compensation. Offering to pay half is beyond reasonable on their part.", "> It's their fault, not mine. And while I appreciate that they took quick action to help my dog, it's their fault the situation happened in the first place.\n\nYTA - You somehow have no problem with friends helping you out for free and paying for your dog to get emergency surgery but when it comes to actually paying them back for an accident outside of everyone's control you try to cut them off after they spent $2500 to save your dog's life. Where is any sense of appreciation or responsibility for them helping you out in the first place and then actually saving your dog from an accident that could've lead to them dying?\n\nFrankly it sounds like you cannot afford your dog and it was irresponsible of you to get one if you can't pay to board them while away on a work trip. It's understandable that you can't afford to outright pay them back in full but at least offer to pay over time or do SOMETHING for people who went out of their way to do you a favor even though it resulted in an unfortunate accident for both your and their dog.", "YTA\n\nWhat did you want your friend to do? Leave your dog to die? That is totally unreasonable.\n\nTo pay the cost of the medical treatment is your responsibility as the pet owner.", "YTA, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not watch dogs closely while they\u2019re playing in a fenced in yard. I love my babies and understand your fear and anger, but it\u2019s at the wrong people. I have also broken up dog fights and they are tough and terrifying. Her husband saved your dog and rushed it to treatment. A random dog jumping a fence is in no way foreseeable. Ask yourself this, if they were walking your dog restrained and paying attention and a random dog ran at them and attacked it, would you still hold them responsible?\n\nObviously it would be better if the owner could be found, this should definitely be reported to law enforcement and animal control, but the bill is yours. Also, it\u2019s very generous of them to even pay half. Honestly I understand not having 2500 I do, but since she was a good friend I\u2019m sure she would take payment in installments! Over time you could do it and still have a good friend", "lol so in the future now they know to just let the dog bleed out then? \n\ndont buy a purebred dog if you cannot afford to take care of it, and pay for expenses when they arise. \n\ndont take responsibility for any pet for that matter. \n\nyta", "OMG YTA! I just want to add my vote, I don't have anything additional. Your friends sound amazing, I wish I had some amazing people near me who would treat my dogs so well. You should pay them every penny and then some because their quick action saved both dogs.", "YTA it was a freak accident and was in no way their fault. You\u2019re telling me that if your dog had been attacked while you were with them, you would not have paid for the emergency surgery and would have let them bleed out? If that\u2019s the case, sell the dog and use the money to repay your friends. You are responsible for the dogs bills and should apologize and start making monthly payments.\n\nNext time should they have just let the Random dog finish mulling your dog to death, that way there would be no medical bills to deal with\u2026? You are incredibly ungrateful for what they did to save your dog I would apologize immediately", "YTA\n\nThis was not their fault, you need to pay the vet bill for your dog.", "YTA. This could have just as easily have happened if you were out on a walk with your dog. You're an even bigger asshole for having a pet and not keeping a retainer for emergencies though. If you can afford a dog and cant afford an emergency- you can't afford an fing dog.  \nYou said these were good friends? be decent and pay half, even if its on a payment plan.", "Sounds like you are lucky this happened with your friend since they could afford the bill. They saved your dog and you're so ungrateful. YTA. You know emergencies happen to animals? Things you'll have to pay for? Or next time something awful happens you'll just say \"welp, don't have 2k, sorry pal!\".", "YTA\n\nYou are a terrible friend, an awful dog owner, and an elitist. You should be thanking your friend and paying them back every penny. Please block them, they are far too good for you.", "You\u2019re a leech, and a horrible friend. Be a better pet owner and get some damn insurance.\nYTA.", "YTA. Your friend wasn\u2019t negligent. Someone else was and unfortunately your dog took the brunt of it. Ultimately though it\u2019s your dog and your bill. You should reimburse your friend and thank your lucky stars they rushed your dog to the vet.", "YTA. I hope your ex-friend sues you because she'll win.", "YTA.  You need to call and apologize to the both of them for how you reacted and then thank them for saving your dog's life.  Because, that's basically what they did.  They have no fault in what happened.  And if you can't afford to pay them in one lump sum, then offer payments.  I'm sure they'll accept that.  But you really need to apologize. You are 100% in the wrong here.", "YTA.  Your friend even offered a compromise to split it.  She was trying to help you by watching the dog.  Unfortunately, an accident happened.  She may also not be able to afford that 2500 dollars, and it's not her dog.  You refused to pay her back.  I bet nobody who knows the both of you will ever agree to watch your dog again.  She did all the right things following the accident, and now you're blaming her.  Next time, get together the money to board your dog.", "YTA. Bold of you to assume everyone has $2,500 they can spare for something they had no fault in causing.", "YTA  They could have waited until they got ahold of you to start treatment, oh wait your dog would have died! They did the responsible thing and got it care immediately paying out of their own pockets because you did the irresponsible thing and did not have your dog insured. You blame them for it happening but I'm assuming you figured it was safe, the same thinking they had so how are you any less guilty.", "YTA, and a big one at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're lucky your friend was willing to pay the vet on the spot or you would've come home to no dog. You sound so ungrateful.", "YTA. \n\nYou probably shouldn\u2019t be allowed a dog either.", "NAH - I don't blame them for asking you to pay at least half and I don't blame you for questioning if you were really half responsible.  If it was me I would come up with the $1,250 even if I had to pawn something to do it.  If that kind of money honestly throws all of your bills into being late for the next year I would simply tell your friend that in person.  Maybe she would be kind and say just pay me a few bucks a month as long as it takes.  Don't just ignore her texts though.  She did do a decent thing coming up with the entire $2,500 the day it happened and then only asking for half.  You aren't going to find many friends as good as her!", "How was it their fault? The dog was in a securely fenced area.\nIt\u2019s not reasonable to expect them to have foreseen that a dog would jump over the fence AND attack another AND be unattended.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly generous of your friends to offer to cover half. Why on earth should they be left over $1,000 out of pocket because they were kind enough to do you a favour.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s really important to have insurance. I get that you are short of money but if you have a pet you take the risk that you are going to have unexpected costs.", "To be honest, you should be going after the owner with the vicious dog who attacked yours and trying to get it put down. Obviously this dog is a danger.", "YTA! If the tables were turned and you were pet sitting for them, you wouldn\u2019t have kept your eyes glued on their dog 24/7 and you know it! \n\nYou\u2019re lucky to have a friend who was willing to take in your dog for free! I only have one friend who is ever willing to watch my dog, and she made it clear from day one that she expected be paid (which I do without question). I would be ecstatic to have a friend like yours who is that caring, generous and responsible (YES- responsible! She took immediate life-saving action following a freak accident & paid a $2500 bill without hesitation). \n\nPay her back, IN FULL. Speak to her about a payment plan and settle up. Whatever you end up doing, I hope she\u2019s realized what a selfish person you are and dumps you as a friend.", "Yta\n\nThey had the option of only fixing their dog and having the vet try to contact you about your dog to work it out. If situation was reversed how would you feel", "First of all, I\u2019m so glad your dog is OK and sorry this happened, pet health stress is absolutely awful. Second, YTA. Paying half is an incredible compromise on your friends behalf. I completely understand your frustration that they brought up payment so early, I remember being peeved at my vet for asking how I was paying when my cat was put down. However, that is truly just part of the deal. If you want a 100% safety/financial responsibility guarantee, you pay the big bucks for a professional boarder with insurance. You understandably went the \u201ceasier\u201d route of a friend for less $$, but with that also comes an increased burden for you if something goes wrong. Don\u2019t add additional friendship stress to what you are already dealing with. I would apologize to your friend, thank them for saving your dogs life, and ask if they are still willing to split the bill. If you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019re going to get brought to small claims court and it will cost a lot more than $2,500.", "YTA the vet bill was NOT due to negligence on the sitters part. You need to pay them back", "They didn't pay for your dog's surgery. They took your dog in for emergency medical care from an incident they had no way of reasonably prevented. Would you have told them to let the dog die because you can't afford it? Did you give specific instructions not to let the dog into the fenced-in yard?\n\nIt's unfortunate the dog got injured, but you can't reasonably hold them accountable for it. If I were your friend, I would take you to small claims court and stop talking to you. YTA", "YTA. Your friend did you a favor because you're too cheap to get bonded, insured care that you would expect from a kennel. That means YOU take on the risk, not your friend. Pay them back and apologize.", "YTA -- it's totally your responsibility and it is not even slightly irresponsible to leave dogs in a fenced in back yard unattended. What? You think your friends should have been outside watching the dogs all afternoon? You owe your friend the full $2500, and if you don't have it on hand, arrange a payment plan. They almost certainly don't have that kind of money lying around either, but it's your dog, it was an accident that was not the result of carelessness but of a freak occurrence (unknown vicious dog that could jump the fence) and of course the first thing the friends ask about is money.

However, the first thing she ACTUALLY did was call and text you about your dog. She never brought up money then. Since it is an expensive bill, of course, she would bring it up and I thought it was tactful when she did. She even went so far as for you to pay HALF. I am sure if you could not pay for it all at once, you could have at least worked out a payment plan.
