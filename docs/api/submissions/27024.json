{"id": 27024, "submission_id": "16kkvpk", "title": "AITA for suggesting to cancel my stepkids\u2019 trip to Paris and Kyoto?", "selftext": "  \nMy husband has 2 kids from a previous 9f and 7m. The kids have been with my husband 100% of the time since my husband and his ex broke up. She has not been very involved in their lives since the youngest was just a year old. They do not have a relationship with their mom, however, her mother and grandmother do visit the kids, but not often. I\u2019ve known the kids since they were 3 and 5.   \n\n\n  \nI\u2019ve traveled a lot during my childhood and as an adult. It\u2019s something that the kids are really interested in. I go on vacation multiple times a year and unfortunately, my husband and the kids could never travel with me outside the US. The kids need a letter of permission to travel abroad, which was hard for us to get since his ex never answered his emails.  \n\n\n  \nMy family and I have been planning a trip to Paris and Kyoto to visit my maternal grandmother and paternal grandparents for Christmas and New Year. My entire family is going on this trip, my parents, in-laws, siblings, cousins, nieces, and nephews. We\u2019ve been planning this trip for over 2 years and we finally bought our plane tickets after my son was born eight weeks ago. My husband\u2019s ex has also signed the letter of permission, so everything is already in order for the trip.   \n\n\n  \nLast weekend my husband\u2019s ex sent him an email regarding our trip. She basically asked if we could cancel our trip, so the kids could spend Christmas with their great-grandmother. Their great-grandmother is supposedly ill and they\u2019re not sure if she\u2019s going to be here next year.  \nMy husband immediately wanted to reject that idea, but I asked him to think about it.  \n\n\n  \nI think it might be good for the kids to stay behind with their grandma. They\u2019ll get to see their great-grandma for maybe for the last and they\u2019ll also see their mom. I know the kids are very excited to travel abroad, but do think this is more important than Paris or Kyoto. Both are just cities they won\u2019t go anywhere and we can visit in summer. I told my husband all of this and he argued that we\u2019d probably not get the money back we already spend. I told him that we bought business-class plane tickets and I know we\u2019ll get that back.   \n\n\n  \nMy husband just got angry and told me that we\u2019re not going to discuss it anymore. My parents and siblings are on his side, but I feel like they\u2019re only looking at the money. When I was a kid my parents also left my siblings and me in Kyoto with my grandparents to go on a trip. At the time I was also angry about it, but as an adult am very happy that I got to spend that time with my grandparents.   \n\n\n  \nI think this is also the case for the kids. They probably won\u2019t be happy about it now, but will really appreciate it when they\u2019re older. My husband disagreed with this and told me I was not looking at the kids\u2019 situation and was angry when I again suggested canceling their trip.

You really do.\n\nAlso if they don\u2019t like their mom, this makes it essentially a punishment to stay with her at Christmas. They will be absolutely miserable. Why would you want this for them?", "INFO\n\nWhy are you trying to let someone else who doesn't have a relationship with her children dictate what you all are doing?", "update: YTA. You're excluding your step-children and still insisting your own child goes on the trip. That's not okay. You have three kids, and they all need to be treated fairly and equally. Either they all go, or none of you do.\n\nIn-fo: what evidence do you have that their great-grandmother is actually sick, as opposed to this just being a power play?

The kids can see their great grandmother now. They don't have to wait until Christmas. If she's really sick, why wait?

Hells yeah that would have been even better!) and I have SO many memories of playing hide-and-seek with my cousins, or just running around in a grassy field...whatever, the travel IS the memory, especially if they're seeing your family. \n\nStep back and see this for what it really is...you just don't want to take them...but honestly, the blowback from this decision is NOT worth it...take the kids. You'll still have a great trip. \n\nYTA", "Info: is there no other time the kids can visit these relatives?", "YTA for obvious reasons", "YTA.

More than half a century later bro and I still talk about it, and I am working on my world map, mounting it on poster board and putting colored pins on places I've been.  You are denying those kids a major memory and trying to excuse it.  Not good.", "Obviously yta - you\u2019re looking for a reason for these kids not to come. But I just don\u2019t get that. You\u2019ve known these kids since they were 3/5. Those are little / toddler years and you say their mother isn\u2019t around-who is the mother in their life? If this was me I\u2019d be fighting to have \u201c my\u201d children come on this trip with me ( and our new baby) as I wouldn\u2019t want them with someone they barely knew ans left out of a fun family trip. Doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s your attitude and you gotta ask yourself why. Hopefully your husband is watching out for these kids and starts to question why that is too.", "I don\u2019t know whether or not you mean for it to read this way, but even with all of your explaining, I read this as \u201cI don\u2019t want my step kids to come on holiday with me and my family and this sounds like a great excuse to get out of it.\u201d\n\nFor that, YTA.", "YTA. They've been excited about this trip and now suddenly you want them to be left behind with a dying relative they barely know? Come on.", "YTA. You are clearly stretching for reasons to leave step kids behind since you have a \u201creal\u201d child now. \n\nThey hardly know their bio mom or her family, missing this trip will cause them a lot more pain then not seeing a great-grandmother they barely know one more time before she dies.", "YTA - obviously the kids want to travel with their dad.\nAnd honestly, I doubt great-grandma want them to visit.\nI have a few memories of my great grandma Bella, she died when I was 10.\nI most certainly did not travel to visit her when she was ill.\nMy son was 8 when my grandfather passed and he absolutely forbade us to visit when he went into the hospital as he did not want us to remember him sick.", "They don\u2019t know this person, I don\u2019t understand your thought process here. Leaving kids with strangers for Christmas is an awful idea. YTA", "This situation is different from yours, though. First of all, they barely have a relationship with those family members. You're suggesting leaving them alone with the mother they barely see and not being available, at least in person, if there are problems.\n\nSecond, you and your siblings were left with your grandparents. Your stepkids would be the only people in the family left behind. You said your nieces, nephews, and your child will be going.

You just don\u2019t want to take them.\nLet them go see their mom and great grandmother another day. How cruel to promise them a trip and then take it away especially after you just had a baby.

Something like that?)", "YTA. You would be depriving the kids of a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Yes, the cities would still be there, but the rest of your travelling companions would not. Leaving them behind would be cruel - especially to stay with family that they don't really know. You would likely ruin your relationship with them for the rest of their lives. They would not forget.\n\nTake the kids to visit their great-grandma before the trip, if you feel that it is so important that they \"see\" her.", "Going with YTA only because that's on-theme. I don't think you're an asshole, I just think you're not thinking creatively enough. Time with relatives before they pass is something that many people value. However, there's nothing to say that Christmas is the only time to do it. Visit before you leave, then take the kids on the trip.", "YTA, have you even verified that she is ill?  If it looks like she will be on deaths doorstep at Christmas, they should be visiting her right now while the memories will still be happy one.  At that age if they are there when she passes it will be trauma, not a memory.  Most of all the ex finally signs off and now this, sounds more like another thing to keep the kids from having a good time that she cannot give them.", "Gentle YTA. The kids have been looking forward to the trip. They can see the ill relative between now and before they take off for the family trip. Creating a Hallmark Christmas with their mom's family doesn't really sound like it should be prioritized. Who's to say the relative will even make it to Christmas. They should visit now.", "Am I the only one wondering why you\u2019re going on vacation from the US to both Paris and Kyoto, which are on opposite sides of the world on one vacation?", "YTA. Just admit it, you want your family to go not the step kids. If your husband allows you to do this he needs to cancel his plans so he can spend the holidays with his family (kids).", "YTA I think you mean it's important to have your stepchildren understand that they are just stepchildren and matter much less than your biological child. Even if you genuinely think that, requesting to leave your stepchildren behind while your husband, their biological father, disagrees, it just seems like you were looking for an excuse to leave his children behind and perception is reality for all intents and purposes.", "YTA. The kids would be upset as this is finally their chance to travel. Their mother who hasn\u2019t been in their life does not get a say.", "YTA. Your step children will absolutely feel pushed aside, abandoned and less than their half sibling. Is this more about how you think your grandparents will react to your step-children? \n\nOn top of all that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to leave them with a mother they barely know and a great grandmother that is sick and likely a complete stranger to them.", "Let\u2019s be real:  You just do want them to come because they\u2019re your step-children.  Nice try.

They don\u2019t, though.", "YTA if you leave them behind, in their eyes you will be saying that now that the new baby is here they aren't your kids anymore and they aren't family and that's why they are the only ones excluded from the FAMILY vacation.  If you leave them behind I promise you that it will have a life long effect on them.", "YTA! You don't want your bio son to share the spotlight! It's all about YOUR kid being the center of attention. There is no way I would have ever suggested to either of my non bio sons to stay home from such a trip. It was all of us or no one.

Drop everything and take them. 2) it\u2019s up to there **father**, not you, whether or not to cancel.", "Yta if you cancel the trip without talking to the kids about it. Find out what they want to do. If they aren't close to mom, I'm guessing they aren't super close to great grandma either.

If it was their mom or grandma it'd be different", "Yta. Not cool to bait and switch them. Prob damage your relationship with them", "YTA! The kids had already gotten the permission to go and were excited for that. You cannot take that away from them, it's not for you to decide. \n\nAnd if the great grandmother is really that sick, the right time to visit would be now, not 5 months later.\n\nIf you are a part of a blended family then the first rule is to make sure that the step-kids aren't left out.

How often have they seen her and did they actually engage with her? What will they remember of this?\n\nThe kids? They are going to remember that they were allowed to go to Paris and Kyoto, and all the amazing things they were gong to see and do\u2026 and suddenly it was all cancelled because their bio mum who they virtually never ever see demanded they stay home because her grandmother was maybe dying and thus their Christmas is now forced to stay home with a bunch of people they don\u2019t know and rarely see and have a limited memory of\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s not going to go well if these kids stay.

From what I'm reading this is going to be a huge extended family trip, and what you want is to have your stepkids to stay behind. Your husband disagrees with you, your family disagrees with you. Why don't you just be honest and say you don't really consider your stepkids family, and you're trying to say you don't want them going without actually saying you don't want them going? All your stepkids are going to remember is how now that you have a baby of your own they're not part of the family anymore. I guarantee your husband is also never going to look at you the same way, because I 100% guarantee he is also thinking you don't consider his kids part of your family, especially the way you're fighting him so hard on his children.\n\nIf you really feel visiting great grandma is that important, and she's really sick, why are you waiting for Christmas?

Either this trip is a huge family vacation you've been planning for 2 years, or you're just visiting some cities.\n\nIf it's the former, then why aren't you making more of an effort for the kids to see great-grandma before Christmas time?

She obviously doesn\u2019t want you and your husband to be giving these kids such an amazing trip. Speak with your husband, keep your family united, and don\u2019t give those kids any reason to hold resentment towards you both for nudging them out because you have a new baby.\nAnd maybe the bio mum needs to be reminded who stepped up and raised these kids, while she put it in the too hard basket.", "Can the kids visit the great grandma Thanksgiving, New Year's , etc.  A weekend during the holiday.

The kids have been with my husband 100% of the time since my husband and his ex broke up. She has not been very involved in their lives since the youngest was just a year old. They do not have a relationship with their mom, however, her mother and grandmother do visit the kids, but not often. I\u2019ve known the kids since they were 3 and 5.   \n\n\n  \nI\u2019ve traveled a lot during my childhood and as an adult. It\u2019s something that the kids are really interested in. I go on vacation multiple times a year and unfortunately, my husband and the kids could never travel with me outside the US. The kids need a letter of permission to travel abroad, which was hard for us to get since his ex never answered his emails.  \n\n\n  \nMy family and I have been planning a trip to Paris and Kyoto to visit my maternal grandmother and paternal grandparents for Christmas and New Year. My entire family is going on this trip, my parents, in-laws, siblings, cousins, nieces, and nephews. We\u2019ve been planning this trip for over 2 years and we finally bought our plane tickets after my son was born eight weeks ago. My husband\u2019s ex has also signed the letter of permission, so everything is already in order for the trip.   \n\n\n  \nLast weekend my husband\u2019s ex sent him an email regarding our trip. She basically asked if we could cancel our trip, so the kids could spend Christmas with their great-grandmother. Their great-grandmother is supposedly ill and they\u2019re not sure if she\u2019s going to be here next year.  \nMy husband immediately wanted to reject that idea, but I asked him to think about it.  \n\n\n  \nI think it might be good for the kids to stay behind with their grandma. They\u2019ll get to see their great-grandma for maybe for the last and they\u2019ll also see their mom. I know the kids are very excited to travel abroad, but do think this is more important than Paris or Kyoto. Both are just cities they won\u2019t go anywhere and we can visit in summer. I told my husband all of this and he argued that we\u2019d probably not get the money back we already spend. I told him that we bought business-class plane tickets and I know we\u2019ll get that back.   \n\n\n  \nMy husband just got angry and told me that we\u2019re not going to discuss it anymore. My parents and siblings are on his side, but I feel like they\u2019re only looking at the money. When I was a kid my parents also left my siblings and me in Kyoto with my grandparents to go on a trip. At the time I was also angry about it, but as an adult am very happy that I got to spend that time with my grandparents.   \n\n\n  \nI think this is also the case for the kids. They probably won\u2019t be happy about it now, but will really appreciate it when they\u2019re older. My husband disagreed with this and told me I was not looking at the kids\u2019 situation and was angry when I again suggested canceling their trip. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA, as I am from a culture that values familial ties even if we\u2019re not that close. Kids are only 9 and 7, they have the rest of their lives to go to Paris and Tokyo. It looks like you guys have a lot of money to make that happen anyway. Another 2 years of planning is nothing.\n\nHowever, I agree with *just some* of the comments that your families could come up with a different solution. Your stepkids can spend other holidays with their maternal great grandmother, ie, Thanksgiving and even other weekends.", "Info: are you Japanese? I feel like Japanese honor elders a lot more so if you are then it reads to me like you're genuine about wanted to give them this time. \n\nThe problem is Americans are not like this so it comes off disingenuous.", "Nta you are right in your way of thinking because you have been in that position and as you said they will look back one day and be grateful.\n\nI will forever mourn that I didn't spend that special time with my loved ones & when I think of them it is always with regret.", "Take the kids and go,  your instinct is right, mom is screwing with you", "I would confidently say NTA and I, in fact, understand your point very well. I have not been in a same situation but I know my parents thought that me spending time with my sick old granddad with whom I didn\u2019t have very close relationship was unimportant. Now as an adult, I regret it and do think that it was extremely important. I chose the same career path in academia as my granddad and wish I had a bit more memories of him. I also see how you are genuinely concerned about you stepkids missing out the opportunity to make a possibility final good memories with the g-grandma at Xmas Eve. In the future they might deeply regret spending time having fun traveling instead of seeing old relatives possibly for the last time. \n\nUnfortunately, people have different priorities and for some the fun trip overseas is more important. I feel somehow that it is the mother to blame. If kids were able to travel regularly (and see that the canceled trip can be repeated with no problem ), they wouldn\u2019t feel so bad. In this situation I advice you to let the dad make the decision. You raised your ( I\u2019m sure) genuine concerns, that\u2019s enough imho. \n\nP.S. People who think you are \u201cevil stepmom\u201d and say you are trying to leave step kids behind seem bizarre to me, I\u2019m puzzled how it\u2019s not clear that you are a simply a person who puts family first before any \u201cfun trip\u201d", "wow I find many comments jumping to conclusions.  Perhaps negotiate a travel letter that will cover future trips AND discuss where that would be.  I do think a discussion (and obviously I am unaware about family interactions, etc.).  But a chance to talk to the girls about possible regrets.  I do think additional conflict/disappointment with their mom might bother them later.  I note many dont take into your account you recognizing their feelings based on your own experiences.  I find that actually talking a bit more to our kids and listening helps, and dad listening too.  In the end, maybe dad should decide, but I think a bigger discussion including the girls might help.  And lots of hugs and lots of future travel (my solution for saving the world is travel)", "NTA\n\nI just lost all three of my living great grandparents in 2019-2020. I was 17, so I had that much time with them, but it still feels too short. My great papa  served in WW2 and I never asked him what that was like, him and my grandma collected salt and pepper shakers, I inherited two, yet I never got them any (my sister did). I learned poker from my other great grandma, we played with pennies and somehow she always had the best hand, I knew a bit of magic at the time and I swear she could palm aces, never did learn the truth though. \n\nThere's never enough time. They won't appreciate it now, you're right, but I remember as much as I can and as often as I can, the small visits to their houses, going on walks when they were still able, tripping over a speed bump we misjudged the height on, my great grandma going head over heels, and my \"just started football this year tough guy\" brother catches her! She talked about it till she was gone, and we retold the story at her funeral. I was 7 when it happened... \n\nthey'll remember someday, and I wouldn't listen to your husbands family about this because they might be harboring feelings of resentment towards the ex's family. But that's the kids family too, and they're depriving them of those fleeting moments to have memories of them alive, instead of just photographs you dig up for a history project. \n\nOp, I'd really talk to your husband about this in detail, not many people get to meet their great grandparents, I know neither of my parents did. The kids deserve that, no trip to Paris or Kyoto could replace it in my eyes, I'd trade that for just a day longer with each of them.", "NTA. It sounds like you're trying to have a rational discussion about what would be best for your husband's kids and he is stonewalling you. Unfortunately, he has the final say in what happens with them, so you might just have to suck it up and take them to Paris and Kyoto... which kinda sounds like an awesome vacation if you ask me. \n\nI can tell you very little about my great grandma and I saw her all the time on holidays until she passed in my early teens. I don't even remember what her name was other than Gram. Maybe traveling will be a better life experience for these kids than hanging around family that doesn't seem to want them around all that often.", "NAH. I understand what you\u2019re saying and I think it\u2019s very considerate. The thing is though\u2026.the kids don\u2019t appear to know the great grandma well\u2026.which makes it a little different from your experience with your grandma. (I\u2019m guessing you had some sort of substantive relationship with your grandma.) It is very unlikely that your step kids will ever see value in missing a family oversees in order to spend time with people they don\u2019t know.", "NTA, you didn't say they shouldn't go, you just said to consider it and that the money won't be an issue if they went to great grandma, and that they could always do a make-up trip with you guys in the summer. Idk why that seems so terrible.\n\nMaybe just ask the kids and make it clear that great grandma isn't going to be around forever, but Kyoto and Paris during summer are just as lovely. Let it be up to them :)\n\nIdk. I miss my great grandparents. I totally see your point of view. I do cherish the very few visits I had with them. They were so old. I had 3 and they were all goof balls.", "NAH but I still think you're wrong. It's not a grandparent, it's a great grandpa parent. Given that the kids are always with you, it's unlikely that they even know this great grandmother well.", "NAH> You should let the kids decide though.", "NTA\n\n\nYou\u2019re not an A for giving your partner your opinion but you will be an A if you don\u2019t drop it!", "nta, this isnt some powwr play, irs not you dont want them along. Someone is sick and maybe dying.. and i ger why not cancel for everyone, you also suggesred taking them again the same year.", "NTA\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you are insisting just suggesting. Your suggestion was noted and not taken so let it go!", "[removed]", "YTA. Sorry, but they barelly know that family", "YTA. And not very self aware either.", "You're cruella, basically. \n\nYTA", "Info- what do the kids want to do?  They are old enough to have a say.", "They should visit now since great grandma is holding on. Don't deny them this trip, don't start being that step parent that treats the other kid different when the new kid comes.", "They are your husband's children. You get a say in somethings because you are married and help take care of them. However, if he wants them to go, then you really shouldn't be saying no.... his exs family is really not your concern.", "YTA. I agree with everyone else that having them go visit great-grandma at literally ANY OTHER TIME before or after this trip is the obvious solution, and the fact that you\u2019re not doing it makes it look like you don\u2019t want to bring the kids.", "YTA. You want to go on a vacation with your real family and it's obvious. And disgusting.", "YTA. We all know the real reason\u2026 and spending time with their estranged extended family is not it lol.", "I think your heart is in the right place, but YTA. \n\n1. Leaving the kids with people that you admit they barely have a relationship while the rest of the family goes and has an amazing vacation with will make them miserable. \n\n2. You have plenty of time to arrange for a visit to the great grandma before your trip. \n\n3. Expressing your opinion was fine but when your husband shot it down that should have been the end of it.", "Either you all stay or you all go. If their great-grandma is that sick that she may not last through Christmas then the kids will need the support of you and their dad when she passes. It would be better for them in the grieving process to be abroad with you then domestically located with a grandma whose mother just died and an estranged mother. If great-grandma isn\u2019t that sick, why not do \u201cChristmas\u201d before or after your trip? Lots of split families don\u2019t stick to the official calendar dates.\n\nI\u2019m sure your husband would feel less angry if you told him you aren\u2019t going on the trip either. If it\u2019s important they stay then it\u2019s just as important you both stay. Yes, it\u2019s a sacrifice on your part, but that\u2019s what parenting is about.", "YTA for an entirely different reason (though you are TA for suggesting the cancellation). I live in Kyoto and it is absolutely awful here in the summer. Disgustingly hot, insanely humid, and there's never any breeze because it's in the valley of a bunch of mountains. Your kids will Not have fun, they'll be hot and uncomfortable and tired.", "If you feel this strongly about it, ASK the kids what they want to do, and be prepared to reschedule the whole trip so no one goes over Christmas and you all wait a bit longer to go together.\n\nDo not leave the two kids behind.", "YTA. The commitment was made to the kids about the trip. They want to go. They don\u2019t really know their mom\u2019s side of the family. The mom will have to be responsible for them while the dad is out of the country and the kids don\u2019t have much relationship with her either and she is not responsible. It\u2019s not your decision to make it\u2019s the dad\u2019s decision and he made it. The kids WILL NOT thank you later after they have a horrible visit with their mom\u2019s family (strangers) and feel abandoned. You think this will be like hallmark movie but the history does not indicate this.", "Info\u2026have you asked the kids what they want? I know they are young but they should at least be asked how they feel and what they want to do.", "Info: don't you have a coal mine you can make em work in instead?\n \nYou don't just casually dip your toe in Disney stepmother villain territory, you dive in.", "YTA, very bad idea to cancel their vacation. It reeks of exclusion\u2026and for what? To visit an ailing, older relative that they barely know and a mother who has little to no relationship with them? What message does that send to them. Their mom is doing this purposefully and you are playing into it. Hopefully only because you are being obtuse, and not because you have malicious intent to purposefully exclude your step kids. Either way, YTA obviously\u2026to all around you and the whole internet of Reddit.", "YTA Why would you touch this with 10 foot pole? Leave this decision with the bio father and keep out of it, it is the definition of a no win situation.  If you demand they go with you and miss seeing their dying great grandmother you are a selfish monster, if you want them to stay with their great grandmother you secretly hate them and don't want them around, so stay out of it.", "Yta. Why would you leave kids with people they don\u2019t know?!?! Sounds like you just want a perfect \u201creal family\u201d trip without then. Gross.", "YTA on this one. Now I\u2019m all for mixed families and step moms being involved, but this isn\u2019t your call. Frankly it\u2019s the kids call to decide if they want to go on vacation or see grandma. It\u2019s not even really dads decision, definitely not their bio moms since she isn\u2019t in their lives. \n\nThe kids are old enough to make this choice without being guilt tripped into thinking this is their last opportunity with their grandma. Who even knows if it truly is the last opportunity?", "Is it possible for them to see the ill (great?)  grandparent before they go?\nThe children deserve some happiness, and if they do both, can hopefully also avoid any regrets later.\n\nThe trip is another chance to bond with your step children, and also them with their half sibling.", "I am a stepmother. My stepchild is now an adult, but prior to my stepchild turning 18, it would never even have crossed my mind to not include my stepchild in a family trip. Now that my stepchild is closer to 30 than 18, and does their own thing. But before, we always gave a choice once the went away to college.\n\nI implore you. Please don\u2019t take this trip away from your step kids, it will only cause resentment and mistrust later on.\n\nIf the maternal great grandmother is really ill, send them for thanksgiving, but don\u2019t take this trip away from them.", "Of course YTA. Your husband's children are not close with mother's side of the family so the only thing they will learn is that after the birth of your own baby you consider them second class kids and that their father lets you treat them this way. Listen to your husband and stop trying to ruin the children's vacation and relationship with their father. If their grandgrandmother is sick, they can be brought to visit on the weekend, waiting for 3 months does not make any sense, it's clearly just an excuse to leave them behind.", "YTA  First, if the kids rarely see their mother and grandmother, how often have they seen their great-grandmother.  Second, it is mid-September.  If she is that ill, they should see her before Christmas.  \n\nTake the kids on the trip.  They will remember it.  Also, if you leave them home with people that are basically strangers they will remember that and resent you.", "Are they not your family? Do you NOT want them to come? Wait, my bad. You don't want them to come.\n\nSeems like you're looking for excuses.\n\nYTA", "YTA. This reads like you just want to be rid of the step kids for a while, and you're making any excuse you can, without saying those words.", "YTA. Great grandmother is 90, and despite no current known threats to her health (she's not even sick, according to OP) COULD die any moment. So, better rush those kids to see her now! How can you be assured she'll live until your trip? OP, \"one last time\" meetings are for adults. But this never was about that, was it?", "YTA\n\nIt would be one thing if you were canceling for the whole event for familial reasons, but telling the kids to go do the \"grandma could die\" stuff while you leave the country to have your fun is ridiculously selfish. Either everyone goes or everyone stays.\n\nAlso how close are they to this relative? They might not care as much about visiting her as you think they should.\n\nEDIT: Oh geeze, Christmas? Why is this even a conversation, you have *months* to visit before the trip. This is so made up.", "YTA\n\nHave you ever thought of asking the kids about what they want?", "I don\u2019t want to say you\u2019re the AH because it sounds like your heart is in the right place and trying to work with their mother and her family. I do think it\u2019s a bad idea to cancel. Maybe instead of doing that, work out for them to visit sooner.", "YTA. The kids don't know anyone of this side of their family, and the confrontation with a dying old Lady sounds rather traumatic. \n\nIf the children want to meet her, visit her for an hour, but don't force the children to stay with strangers for several days while you have a fun trip.", "YTA\n\nKids are old enough to have a say in the decision. If the clearly want to to travel and mom already have permission- I would bring them.", "Yta. You're over the step kids now, right? Since you have your own bio kid. It's so obvious that you're looking for excuses not to take the step kids on vacation.", "YTA. If she\u2019s that bad off, why wouldn\u2019t they visit her now. What does Christmas have to do with anything? Also, they don\u2019t see their grandmother often so why on earth would you leave them behind with them?", "YTA for wanting to make them stay behind with relatives they barely know while you get to go live it up. \n\nNah. Take the kids with you as planned. They hardly know their mom.", "Pretty tough situation to be in, dad wants children to go together, mum (ex-partner) wants them to stay (because of grandmother); the op herself has similar experience, that shows her the value of staying. \nAlso, ex-partner is pretty good at throwing wrenches into things. \nIt's good, that you talk about it. Have you thought, what you want? I think dad's opinion matters more in this case, if he thinks they should go, then they should. Unless he unloads all the children on you, and you end up taking care of everything, that sucks...", "I think this is probably a well-meaning YTA? You think they will appreciate spending time with their great-grandmother when they're older, but that appreciation is contingent on their entire memory of their great-grandmother not being associated with missing out on something they really wanted to do. \n\nYou need to find a way for them to spend time with their great-grandmother that doesn't feel like a punishment.", "YTA big time.", "You mentioned <i>your</i> entire family is going on this trip, I guess it\u2019s pretty clear that those kiddos are not included then\u2026", "You want to leave kids alone with effectively strangers while you go overseas and they can't go home if they're uncomfortable? YTA. The rest just increases how much of an AH you are.", "YTA\n\nThere is plenty of time between now and your vacation for the kids to visit great greatgrandma. Multiple times, even... I see absolutely no reason why it has to be during Christmas, other than the ex wanting to interfere with your plans. Sounds as if she's jealous of this familytrip....", "9 and 7? They will have better memories with their grandparents. They can never get that back. I don't think either of you are TA, you just see it through a different lens.

Those are valid too and he probably feels like you bringing it up more than once means you're not hearing him.\n\nBio mom made her position clear.\n\nIn the end, it'll be up to bio mom and your husband.

You are literally letting these kids be show ponies. They do not need to be part of that. They are going to have to process watching someone die and seeing their \"mother\" without any of their safe people there. That isn't remotely healthy for them.", "Gentle YTA\n\nHe is never able to get ahols of her to get the needed letters signed and the first time he is able to you want him to cancel the trip?\nThat's wrong in my eyes.\n\nWhy not just do a weekend trip up to see her for an early Christmas celebration? Work out a time around the trip to visit.", "I\u2019m going to give you a little YTA, because I can see your point of view, but there are a lot of superseding factors here. The kids have wanted to travel but couldn\u2019t because of their mom, and they finally have permission to.

It sounds like they should make more efforts to see the grandmother *now* and up until you all leave for your trip together.", "I don't feel like calling takes much effort if a person has the ability to make any effort at all.", "Do you find it odd that the mother is the one making this request and not the grandmother or great gran that have actually wanted to be in the kids life?  Could it be she is just jealous and wants to sabotage this trip for your family?  Why can't they spend Thanksgiving instead?", "I don't believe for one second that you'd be totally fine sending your infant son on a long international trip with your parents while you stayed back with your step-kids. He'll be what, 5 months old? And you don't want to spend Christmas with your baby?", "My initial thought is that you've made this suggestion out of true concern for your stepkids' maternal relationships, but I have a big question:\n\nIf there is a concern that ggma won't be here in 4 months, then why wait 3 months for your stepkids to see her? Why don't they see her over one of the long weekends coming up or at Thanksgiving? Why in the world do they have to wait till Christmas? And possibly for ggma's condition to have seriously deteriorated by then?\n\nIt sounds like ggma had a direct relationship with the kids (not through their mother), so it doesn't matter if their mom can be there when they go. They just need to visit with ggma. (They can visit with their mom anytime.)\n\nThen they are free to travel with their family (you and their dad etc.) on a major family trip.\n\nMany people have asked you why not have the kids visit earlier, but you haven't answered that question yet.\n\nSo, I have started to wonder if you are either (1) being played by their mom or (2) you are wanting to exclude them without looking bad.\n\nI hope you answer the question about the possibility of them visiting ggma sometime sooner than Christmas.", "I am very concerned that you didn't see anything wrong with \"Okay Cinderella #1 and #2, MY kid gets to literally go on a fantastic overseas adventure the likes of which you've never experienced, and YOU get to be stuck at an old-folks home bored out of your mind\"\n\nTreat all the children equally is rule #1 of a blended family.", "Well I guess hubby doesn't need to come then, since he's not related either. \n\nThe fact that she wants to dump them on a dying relative with zero emotional support says a lot about her tbh.", "Re-read my comment. I said trying to make decisions, and you\u2019re dodging my question.", "Can confirm. Got $700 flight to Thailand from SE US by taking a layover in Istanbul (can likely guess the airline).", "Yes, it was so much cheaper to have a stop in Paris. from NY to Tokyo was like 7600 per person for business class tickets. I paid 3600 per person for this trip.", "I traveled A LOT as a kid and even more as an adult.  That is a weird itinerary", "In my experience people typically stick with one area of the globe per trip", "I\u2019ve been a travel agent for 16 years, and I\u2019ve never planned an itinerary like that. Most people want to maximize their vacation and 2 regions in one trip is inefficient.", "I loved my great-grandmother dearly. She died when I was 11 but I remember so many holidays at her home in all of the previous years, and have such a strong sense of her from spending all of that time with her. So it\u2019s possible they are close and will remember. \n\nBut it\u2019s also possible the kids barely know her.", "Not necessarily. I have very clear memories that go back until the age of 4. My great grandmother died when I was 6 and I have very cherished memories of her.", "YTA, yeah bring a 7/9 year kid to a person dying of old age (who possible may not interact) and all you are going to get is grief and trauma. On the other hand, a trip to Paris/Kyoto is going to generate joy and happy memories. So cancelling an event that generate happiness which they were looking forward for more than a year and going to an event which will generate sadness and grief may not be a wise choice.", "Why take them to Paris if they\u2019re not going to retain long term memories?", "My Great grandma died when I was 8 and we were so close I still miss her and my kids see theirs multiple times a week. I\u2019m so grateful for these relationships. Some of my core memories are with my great grandma. And I hope if I died tomorrow no matter if my kids are only 7 or 9 they remember me. Edit* I do understand this situation is different but to say no kid would remember isn\u2019t true", "Like others have said, not necessarily true. I knew 3 of my great grandparents, 2 of whom died before I was 10, and I remember all of them", "It\u2019s not just about them. There is a woman nearing the end of her life who might be holding on to seeing her great grandchildren before she goes. They have a mother who could very well want to make the most of what could be the last time she gets to see her own children interact with the grandmother she has known her entire life.\n\n7 and 9 are young, but not too young to start learning that sometimes in life we have to make sacrifices for others.", "I fondly remember my great grandparents and I was in this age range when they passed. But I remember more 5han one visit and I was not just dumped with them for weeks.", "my great grandparents died when I was 7 and I remember them", "i cant second this. i was 7 when my granddad died. and i remember almost everything you know", "Totally depends my kids great grandpa (their papa) is a major fixture in their lives and have been since they were born. They are now 10 & 12 and I don't think there is anyone they adore more and I'm forever grateful that they have these relationships with their family members.", "They are in contactbwiyh the grandma and great grandma, they jusy do not see them often.\nIf she is dying they should go now and not wait for christmas. Also those kids should not see her on her death bed, that may be traumatising.", "She's not some strange lady. They have met her and see her more often than their Mother.", "Since when does a family member dying equate to trauma?!? 100 percent of humans will die\u2026 I literally don\u2019t get what\u2019s so traumatic about a completely normal life experience! There are DEFINITELY traumatic deaths but old age isn\u2019t one of them", "No, you got got by her narrative. She wrote it vaguely to be misleading.\n\nShe was left in Kyoto with her grandparents, the same grandparents she\u2019s going to see now.", "Sure.", "Turning Thanksgiving into an early Christmas celebration is the best compromise here.", "My son is an infant, and he's going to meet my family.", "there is no adventure he's going on", "I can because that was decided between him and I.", "Did you have grandparents in Kyoto and Paris at any point as a kid?\n\nMy parents' families are spread between California, the West Indies, West Africa, and SE Asia. I've taken a handful of 'around the world' type trips like this just because of parents not being able to take time off work and travel agents being able to get cheap flights for trips (NY to West Indies to West Africa, NY to California to SE Asia to West Africa)", "But OP said mom hasn\u2019t been involved in the kids lives since they were 1 and 3 so how many memories of great grandma can they have and how close to great grandma are they really???\n\nI damn sure wouldn\u2019t be leaving would not be leaving my young (step) kids with family they haven\u2019t seen in 6 years to go flying around the world. And I don\u2019t blame Dad for not being on board at all.", "Sounds like you had a great relationship,not the distant one these kids have. I feel like they would resent missing the trip more than saying goodbye to a great grandparent they don\u2019t really know", "Dying is as natural a part of life as birth! We don\u2019t treat us like it anymore, everyone is so afraid and no one wants to see anyone age\u2026 delusional", "Ha! Don't say that, it invalidates every activity I take my toddler to. XD\n\nIt's nice to have memories of your kids discovering and enjoying the world with you even if they don't retain much of it themselves years down the line.", "Did you even read the post? Good for you, but that is obviously not the case here.", "Their mother hasn't been involved since the youngest was a baby and grandma and great-grandma don't even visit often. \n\nWhy should a 7 and 9 year old sacrifice a trip they've been looking forward to for years for adults who've never sacrificed anything for them?", "I don't get why they can't visit another time or spend Thanksgiving there.", "That's not saying much", "They haven't met so often and they would have to stay somewhere else, not with a sick 90year old lady. While Mom and Dad and the new sibling may go on a vacation.", "We are talking about little children. It is hard enough for grown ups. It's enough to visit for an hour for the children.", "You're giving off big \"now that I have my own bio child, I'm over these other kids\" vibes.", "Your son is going to meet your family. Have your step kids met your family?", "No offense, but why tf is he going if hes an infant? Unlike your step kids, hes not going to remember shit", "So it's only for your 'real family' who get to tag along then? At least be honest with yourself", "Gentle YTA. Your stepchildren are also going to meet your family. Isn't that just as important? Look. I understand your reasoning behind the hesitation. But I think you're majorly projecting your own experience onto a completely different situation. Just because you are grateful to have spent time with your grandparents now, doesn't mean your step children will be. Most likely, what you'll get is two children that resent your for years, constantly questioning why you chose to ditch them as soon as your 'real' child is born. I'm happy to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume this isn't the case, but I strongly recommend you seperate your own experience from theirs and realise how different the circumstances are. Also, get some confirmation of grandma's health and suggest getting them over to see her before Christmas.", "None of which changes the fact that your son is being treated differently to your stepkids.\n\nIf the trip can occur in future for them, it can occur in future for your son as well.", "Don't take it literally \ud83d\ude44", "Alright, well just know that continuing to push and try to override your husband\u2019s desires here will not end in good news for your marriage. You need to take his, and his kids\u2019, wants into deep consideration here. I get the sense you might not really want them along on the trip, and I\u2019m sure they\u2018ll get that sense too. YTA.", "Why are you trying to exclude your step children from a family trip EVERYONE is going on?!? YTA", "You don\u2019t really have the final say though, about your husband\u2019s kids.", "No you can't, his kids, his decision. \n\nOn one hand you say they are not close with their mother and on the other hand you want them to stay with their mother. That just sounds and is wrong.", "but OP also said that their grandma and great grandma were involved", "Yes, I read the post. They may not have a close relationship, but the idea that they\u2019re not going to retain memories of things that happen at 9 and 10 is just flat wrong", "Because their mom is trying to sabotage the trip.", "Her family is comprised of adults and teenagers who will remember meeting him? Duh? LOL", "OP's son is being treated differently because he doesn't have a parent asking to cancel the trip so he can be with his dying great-grandparent.\n\nOP's family has been planning this for two years. They planned on taking the stepkids. It wasn't until the stepkids mom asked them to cancel the trip that OP considered going without them.", "This is giving me \u201cI want to vacation with my REAL family\u201d vibes", "She doesn\u2019t want them to go. She acts like they are a burden. She jets off multiple times a year on vacation. The husband stays with his kids. Honestly he should just divorce her bc she is never going to accept his kids.", "That's what's bugging me too. If you are such a key person in their lives, making memories with your side of their family seems very important too, rather than being left out.", "She said they visit, but not often.", "The paternal grandparents i believe, not the birth mom\u2019s side.\n\nETA: i was wrong, it is the maternal grandparents.", "You're right, they will certainly remember having to miss out on this trip to hang out with a dying great-grandparent  they're not close to.", "This is exactly it.", "No. OP has three children, step or no. She has to treat them all equally. There is no means or excuse that will ever make it okay to not.\n\nOP is also the one saying they go overseas in the summer instead. She's the one suggesting to cancel. Its very simple then; either they all cancel or no one cancels. Either, they as a singular family unit go now, or they all go as a singular family unit to see their childrens' dying great-grandmother and go later.\n\nHer son is eight months old, he's not going to miss out by waiting six more months. And her family aren't dying; there will be plenty of opportunities for them to meet *all* her kids.\n\nBut even if you want to suggest that her son doesn't have a dying great-grandmother - all the more reason for the OP to be with her stepkids and *not* take her and her eight-month-old on a fancy holiday instead. Her stepkids need her here with them. They need all their parental figures with them here. She should be a good stepmum by offering support and comfort to the kids she sworn to care for as her own by marriage, during a difficult time in their young lives.", "Yup, agreed. Sad.", "One set of my grandparents lived on the other side of the world the first 10 years of my life. I think they were able to visit once or twice max and I remember the good times we did have together. I remember my grandpa asking me to find and count all his grey hair and my grandma offering me $ to pull them. Not a lot of memories but I still remember them - so even if they only meet them once it potentially could be a life changing memory that happens", "\"My family and I have been planning a trip to Paris and Kyoto to visit my maternal grandmother and paternal grandparents for Christmas and New Year. My entire family is going on this trip, my parents, in-laws, siblings, cousins, nieces, and nephews. We've been planning this trip for over 2 years and we finally bought our plane tickets after my son was born eight weeks ago. My husband's ex has also signed the letter of permission, so everything is already in order for the trip.\"", "Yep. So either *all* her kids go, or none of her family unit do. Either her family meets *all* her kids, as was clearly planned since the trip was been in the works for two years, or they reschedule like OP claims they can.\n\n> Both are just cities they won\u2019t go anywhere and we can visit in summer. \n\nOP is a parent; the kids needs come first. She has three children, not one.  The kids need their stepmum to treat them fairly. That means an overseas trips is either all of them or none of them, and that means that if two of them are seeing a dying great-grandparent they need their stepmum *with them there*."]}
