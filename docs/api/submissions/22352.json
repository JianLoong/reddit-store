I still live at home, too. That will change in the near future.\n\nDriving up to Wyoming, my dad, mom and I split up the 12-hour drive. During my 4-hour turn, my parents were super tense the whole time. Keep in mind I've had my license since I was 18. But they  pointed out every car that came too close, called out every speed trap (\"60! 45!\"), each pothole I couldn't avoid and already slowed down over, etc. My dad literally had his head craned up toward the front nearly the whole time.\n\nEven my parents admit I'm a good driver, so I don't know why they acted like this. Maybe because it was a rental car\u2013-and they didn't officially add my name as a driver, so they would be in trouble if I got pulled over\u2013\u2013but even when they added me later in the vacation, they still acted like this, and only with me.\n\nWe stopped by Whole Foods before going to our hotel, where they flipped out because I was \"driving too fast\" in the parking lot. Yet, I distinctly remember only going 15mph, max. I parked and they basically ranted and screamed at me. I sat quietly through it, tired and trying not to cry, so when they were done, I said, \"Okay, I'll just drive better next time,\" which probably came off dismissive, which pissed them off more.\n\nEither way, I will say, my dad did apologize for his blow-up. Which made me try to shrug the day off and hope things would be better tomorrow.\n\nNext day, we go to the parks, then we go got some snacks from the store again and headed back to the hotel. My mom and I were unpacking groceries while my dad and brother unloaded bags. I had unintentionally put one bag too close to the edge and it fell while my back was turned and a glass kombucha broke inside.\n\nMy dad walked in to the sight of me cleaning up and immediately got upset. He said I wasn't cleaning it right, moved me aside so he could clean it, then lectured me on how to clean glass and be more careful on unloading grocery bags.\n\nI stood there and listened to him, but then he stood up, asked me what's wrong, and I said nothing. Then he said, \"That's why shit like this keeps happening, because you don't want to listen.\"\n\nI probably break a glass once a year, if that. Usually I stand there and withstand these rants, but something in me clicked and I walked away to go upstairs. It all felt ridiculous and unfair.\n\nThe next morning, I came downstairs with packed bags and told my parents I'm flying back to Texas, and I'll stay with a friend since our house doors are locked. You can imagine how they reacted.\n\nI'm literally in the airport writing this right now. This is the boldest move I've done. Maybe too bold.

YTA, however, for tolerating this behavior and not speaking up. You're an adult OP, pack up your bags and move out. Stop putting up with your parents'  nonsense and live independently.", "NTA, they should treat you with more respect and acknowledge that you're no longer a child.  I will note, that most children/parents have this kind of blow up at some point in their lives, and how you each handle the next step after this blowup will determine how your relationship will go forward in the future.\n\nAlso, not justifying their actions, but their \"treating you as a child\" could partly be because that's how they look at you (always will) and you've apparently never been pushed hard enough to push back against that with them.  Living at their home makes this worse because they're not able to distinguish that you're not a child anymore.  My advice, if you can, 1. when you have time, make a list of all the things they do to make you feel like they treat you like a child; 2. explain to them how you would like/prefer to be treated; and 3. as you noted, move out (when you can).  \n\nGood luck", "NTA \n\nYou lasted a lot longer than I would have!

Unless you\u2019ve done some deplorably childish things you\u2019re not tell us about, they need to accept you\u2019re an adult and respect you. You need to move out and move on too. Pay for your holidays in the future.", "NTA, and well done. There's a point when constant unwarranted critique becomes too much, and you handled that crossing point very well indeed. No blow-ups, no recriminations. Just departure. \n\nVery well done. Have a wonderful stay at your friend's - though I confess I'm wondering WTF an adult child doesn't have a house-key. (If you simply left it at home because \"travelling\", cool, but I'm getting the vibe that your parents control that access - and that is fucked up.)", "NTA - family is just too much sometimes. I moved to the other side of the country from mine, works awesome.", "NTA - bravo, well done for standing up for yourself and not bearing their patronizing constant stream of criticism.  Perhaps they'll learn how to be more polite now.", "NTA nobody wants to be screamed at continuously while on vacation.", "YTA. You are 25 and still live at home Your parents pay for the entire vacation and you throw tantrums when they are \"not nice\". Is there a surprise they treat you as a child?  Move out, earn money, become self-sufficient and then you will be able to insist that they treat you like an adult.,.,.", "NTA.\n\nIMO, the problem is that you still live at home. \n\nNo matter how old you get, as long as you live there, the roles that two other adults that live there will always see themselves in is PARENT, (instead of father and mother, which is different) and can only see you as the child. \n\nThis will not change until you leave home and are on your own (and it may not change even then, if they are as hyper-aware and unforgiving of any mistake you make as you've described).\n\nI've lived through almost this exact scenario with my father long ago. It took until I was 40 and had been out of their house for decades and owned a house, a car, had my own business and more for him to finally treat me as an equal adult. Even then sometimes he'd regress back into the Picky Parent role. \n\nBe patient, get your act together and move out and get on with your life. Once you do, perhaps your parents will be better about things and less controlling and abusive.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s so hard standing up for yourself, especially to your parents. i don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve managed to put up with them treating you like you\u2019re 15 when you\u2019re 25, but, don\u2019t feel bad about making a bold move. if they threaten to talk to other family members about you \u201cbailing on the vacation\u201d or some shit, you can say something like \u201cdon\u2019t forget to tell them why i left, because you were treating me like an actual child when i\u2019m an adult, and you wouldn\u2019t stop belittling me over simple human mistakes\u201d", "NTA \n\nHave you ever spoke to your parents about how you felt?", "NTA. You\u2019re 25 years old and being treated like your a child, it\u2019s very condescending and sounds like a lot of build up emotions over it, which is completely justified. Idk if you\u2019ve ever tried having a conversation with them about the way they treat you & how it makes you feel,  gf it could be worth trying. It will at least get it off your chest.
