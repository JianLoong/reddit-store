I still live at home, too. That will change in the near future.\n\nDriving up to Wyoming, my dad, mom and I split up the 12-hour drive. During my 4-hour turn, my parents were super tense the whole time. Keep in mind I've had my license since I was 18. But they  pointed out every car that came too close, called out every speed trap (\"60! 45!\"), each pothole I couldn't avoid and already slowed down over, etc. My dad literally had his head craned up toward the front nearly the whole time.\n\nEven my parents admit I'm a good driver, so I don't know why they acted like this. Maybe because it was a rental car\u2013-and they didn't officially add my name as a driver, so they would be in trouble if I got pulled over\u2013\u2013but even when they added me later in the vacation, they still acted like this, and only with me.\n\nWe stopped by Whole Foods before going to our hotel, where they flipped out because I was \"driving too fast\" in the parking lot. Yet, I distinctly remember only going 15mph, max. I parked and they basically ranted and screamed at me. I sat quietly through it, tired and trying not to cry, so when they were done, I said, \"Okay, I'll just drive better next time,\" which probably came off dismissive, which pissed them off more.\n\nEither way, I will say, my dad did apologize for his blow-up. Which made me try to shrug the day off and hope things would be better tomorrow.\n\nNext day, we go to the parks, then we go got some snacks from the store again and headed back to the hotel. My mom and I were unpacking groceries while my dad and brother unloaded bags. I had unintentionally put one bag too close to the edge and it fell while my back was turned and a glass kombucha broke inside.\n\nMy dad walked in to the sight of me cleaning up and immediately got upset. He said I wasn't cleaning it right, moved me aside so he could clean it, then lectured me on how to clean glass and be more careful on unloading grocery bags.\n\nI stood there and listened to him, but then he stood up, asked me what's wrong, and I said nothing. Then he said, \"That's why shit like this keeps happening, because you don't want to listen.\"\n\nI probably break a glass once a year, if that. Usually I stand there and withstand these rants, but something in me clicked and I walked away to go upstairs. It all felt ridiculous and unfair.\n\nThe next morning, I came downstairs with packed bags and told my parents I'm flying back to Texas, and I'll stay with a friend since our house doors are locked. You can imagine how they reacted.\n\nI'm literally in the airport writing this right now. This is the boldest move I've done. Maybe too bold.

Stop putting up with your parents'  nonsense and live independently.", "NTA, they should treat you with more respect and acknowledge that you're no longer a child.  I will note, that most children/parents have this kind of blow up at some point in their lives, and how you each handle the next step after this blowup will determine how your relationship will go forward in the future.\n\nAlso, not justifying their actions, but their \"treating you as a child\" could partly be because that's how they look at you (always will) and you've apparently never been pushed hard enough to push back against that with them.  Living at their home makes this worse because they're not able to distinguish that you're not a child anymore.  My advice, if you can, 1. when you have time, make a list of all the things they do to make you feel like they treat you like a child; 2. explain to them how you would like/prefer to be treated; and 3. as you noted, move out (when you can).  \n\nGood luck", "NTA \n\nYou lasted a lot longer than I would have!

Unless you\u2019ve done some deplorably childish things you\u2019re not tell us about, they need to accept you\u2019re an adult and respect you. You need to move out and move on too.

No blow-ups, no recriminations. Just departure. \n\nVery well done. Have a wonderful stay at your friend's - though I confess I'm wondering WTF an adult child doesn't have a house-key.

You are 25 and still live at home Your parents pay for the entire vacation and you throw tantrums when they are \"not nice\". Is there a surprise they treat you as a child?

It took until I was 40 and had been out of their house for decades and owned a house, a car, had my own business and more for him to finally treat me as an equal adult.

You\u2019re 25 years old and being treated like your a child, it\u2019s very condescending and sounds like a lot of build up emotions over it, which is completely justified. Idk if you\u2019ve ever tried having a conversation with them about the way they treat you & how it makes you feel,  gf it could be worth trying. It will at least get it off your chest.
