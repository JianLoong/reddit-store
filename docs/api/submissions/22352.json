Maybe because it was a rental car\u2013-and they didn't officially add my name as a driver, so they would be in trouble if I got pulled over\u2013\u2013but even when they added me later in the vacation, they still acted like this, and only with me.\n\nWe stopped by Whole Foods before going to our hotel, where they flipped out because I was \"driving too fast\" in the parking lot. Yet, I distinctly remember only going 15mph, max. I parked and they basically ranted and screamed at me. I sat quietly through it, tired and trying not to cry, so when they were done, I said, \"Okay, I'll just drive better next time,\" which probably came off dismissive, which pissed them off more.\n\nEither way, I will say, my dad did apologize for his blow-up. Which made me try to shrug the day off and hope things would be better tomorrow.\n\nNext day, we go to the parks, then we go got some snacks from the store again and headed back to the hotel.

I had unintentionally put one bag too close to the edge and it fell while my back was turned and a glass kombucha broke inside.\n\nMy dad walked in to the sight of me cleaning up and immediately got upset. He said I wasn't cleaning it right, moved me aside so he could clean it, then lectured me on how to clean glass and be more careful on unloading grocery bags.\n\nI stood there and listened to him, but then he stood up, asked me what's wrong, and I said nothing. Then he said, \"That's why shit like this keeps happening, because you don't want to listen.\"\n\nI probably break a glass once a year, if that. Usually I stand there and withstand these rants, but something in me clicked and I walked away to go upstairs. It all felt ridiculous and unfair.\n\nThe next morning, I came downstairs with packed bags and told my parents I'm flying back to Texas, and I'll stay with a friend since our house doors are locked.

I will note, that most children/parents have this kind of blow up at some point in their lives, and how you each handle the next step after this blowup will determine how your relationship will go forward in the future.\n\nAlso, not justifying their actions, but their \"treating you as a child\" could partly be because that's how they look at you (always will) and you've apparently never been pushed hard enough to push back against that with them.  Living at their home makes this worse because they're not able to distinguish that you're not a child anymore.  My advice, if you can, 1. when you have time, make a list of all the things they do to make you feel like they treat you like a child; 2. explain to them how you would like/prefer to be treated; and 3. as you noted, move out (when you can).  \n\nGood luck", "NTA \n\nYou lasted a lot longer than I would have!

She said the same when I attempted suicide at 13, and at 15, and each of the following times until earlier this year. \n\nWhen I'm having the worst times of my life, all I want is for my mum to give me a hug and tell me it will all be OK. Instead what I get is her voice in my head telling me I fucked up and I deserve what I'm going through. Then I get her actually telling me that I can't expect her to help because she has things going on. \n\nShe's proven time and again I can't rely on her but the scared child in me still desperately wants her to love me in a way that shows she at least likes who I am. \n\n\nIt sounds like OP is in a similar dynamic, and I want her to read this and know that moving out is the best thing she can do for her mental health, and ask her to be kind to herself too. That's the hardest part, undoing all those parts of yourself that are tied up with your mum's voice in your head. \n\nTake a breath when they come and ask yourself and her if they're true. If mum's voice says you're worthless, ask the voice for OBJECTIVE examples, and fight back with objective proof that actually, you're fucking amazing.", "I suspect OP learned a long, long time ago that expressing her feelings or protesting in any way just made it much worse.", "There is a point where enough is enough. I knew where this was going when i read about how they acted inside the car. Yeah the mature thing is to express yourself but as i said when enough is enough you don't act and shouldn't act mature. You get the fuck out and try a different approach while at the same time sending a message. The message being you are insufarable. She is definitely not the asshole and im pretty sure this thing has been building up for years. Good on her.", "I lost my keys one morning so dad told me to lock myself out when I went to school and he would make sure he was home before me. That afternoon we found my keys in the pantry \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I flew back to my home country to visit family and left my keys with my housemates. I wouldn't bring my keys if I was on a road trip with family. \n\nIt might not be anything malicious in this case."]}
