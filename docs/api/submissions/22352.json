Maybe because it was a rental car\u2013-and they didn't officially add my name as a driver, so they would be in trouble if I got pulled over\u2013\u2013but even when they added me later in the vacation, they still acted like this, and only with me.\n\nWe stopped by Whole Foods before going to our hotel, where they flipped out because I was \"driving too fast\" in the parking lot. Yet, I distinctly remember only going 15mph, max. I parked and they basically ranted and screamed at me. I sat quietly through it, tired and trying not to cry, so when they were done, I said, \"Okay, I'll just drive better next time,\" which probably came off dismissive, which pissed them off more.\n\nEither way, I will say, my dad did apologize for his blow-up. Which made me try to shrug the day off and hope things would be better tomorrow.\n\nNext day, we go to the parks, then we go got some snacks from the store again and headed back to the hotel.

Then he said, \"That's why shit like this keeps happening, because you don't want to listen.\"\n\nI probably break a glass once a year, if that. Usually I stand there and withstand these rants, but something in me clicked and I walked away to go upstairs. It all felt ridiculous and unfair.\n\nThe next morning, I came downstairs with packed bags and told my parents I'm flying back to Texas, and I'll stay with a friend since our house doors are locked.

I will note, that most children/parents have this kind of blow up at some point in their lives, and how you each handle the next step after this blowup will determine how your relationship will go forward in the future.\n\nAlso, not justifying their actions, but their \"treating you as a child\" could partly be because that's how they look at you (always will) and you've apparently never been pushed hard enough to push back against that with them.  Living at their home makes this worse because they're not able to distinguish that you're not a child anymore.  My advice, if you can, 1. when you have time, make a list of all the things they do to make you feel like they treat you like a child; 2. explain to them how you would like/prefer to be treated; and 3. as you noted, move out (when you can).  \n\nGood luck", "NTA \n\nYou lasted a lot longer than I would have!
