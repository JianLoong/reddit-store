Maybe because it was a rental car\u2013-and they didn't officially add my name as a driver, so they would be in trouble if I got pulled over\u2013\u2013but even when they added me later in the vacation, they still acted like this, and only with me.\n\nWe stopped by Whole Foods before going to our hotel, where they flipped out because I was \"driving too fast\" in the parking lot. Yet, I distinctly remember only going 15mph, max. I parked and they basically ranted and screamed at me. I sat quietly through it, tired and trying not to cry, so when they were done, I said, \"Okay, I'll just drive better next time,\" which probably came off dismissive, which pissed them off more.\n\nEither way, I will say, my dad did apologize for his blow-up. Which made me try to shrug the day off and hope things would be better tomorrow.\n\nNext day, we go to the parks, then we go got some snacks from the store again and headed back to the hotel.

I had unintentionally put one bag too close to the edge and it fell while my back was turned and a glass kombucha broke inside.\n\nMy dad walked in to the sight of me cleaning up and immediately got upset.

Then he said, \"That's why shit like this keeps happening, because you don't want to listen.\"\n\nI probably break a glass once a year, if that. Usually I stand there and withstand these rants, but something in me clicked and I walked away to go upstairs. It all felt ridiculous and unfair.\n\nThe next morning, I came downstairs with packed bags and told my parents I'm flying back to Texas, and I'll stay with a friend since our house doors are locked.

I will note, that most children/parents have this kind of blow up at some point in their lives, and how you each handle the next step after this blowup will determine how your relationship will go forward in the future.\n\nAlso, not justifying their actions, but their \"treating you as a child\" could partly be because that's how they look at you (always will) and you've apparently never been pushed hard enough to push back against that with them.  Living at their home makes this worse because they're not able to distinguish that you're not a child anymore.  My advice, if you can, 1. when you have time, make a list of all the things they do to make you feel like they treat you like a child; 2. explain to them how you would like/prefer to be treated; and 3. as you noted, move out (when you can).  \n\nGood luck", "NTA \n\nYou lasted a lot longer than I would have!

So if you are in a scenario where you\u2019ve been asked to unpack groceries in a particular way and you don\u2019t listen and every so often it ends with glass and kombucha everywhere, I can completely understand your dad\u2019s reaction. Those I know in the same boat do often feel they are constantly being yelled at \u201cfor no reason\u201d while the person providing instructions is so so frustrated because it feels like they are deliberately being ignored with predictable results. For what it\u2019s worth, breaking a glass once a year strikes me as a little high for an adult who is being careful.\n\nAnyway - maybe you don\u2019t have attention issues but I think might be worth you looking into just in case.\n\nOn to the question of whether you should have left or not. I think you should have first sat down with your dad when you were calm and explained that you didn\u2019t appreciate how he treated you. You should have asked him to think of his words and actions in the context of another adult. If a coworker had broken the kombucha bottle, would his words have been appropriate? I would have suggested you tell him you feel that he is struggling with treating you as an adult and his constant comments and occasional verbal abuse meant that you were seriously thinking of cutting short your vacation. I would have then set your boundaries (no yelling etc).\n\nThen I would have given him another chance. If he started treating me like a child, you say: \u201cDad, how you are treating me is an example of the kind of behaviour we talked about. Please stop.\u201d If he doesn\u2019t, then you calmly extract yourself and go home.\n\nStomping off without discussion doesn\u2019t really send the message of \u201cI am a mature adult\u201d, which you will need to make sure is at the center of every interaction with your family if you want to change the dynamic. That said, unless they reach out and you want to give them one last chance and follow my suggested approach I wouldn\u2019t go back now. You\u2019ll still want to have the talk with them later where you establish new ground rules for your relationship.\n\nNTA though. This is overall a good first step, just likely won\u2019t get you to where you want as quickly as if you had set those boundaries upfront.\n\nPS don\u2019t agree to any more long car rides with your parents until you feel they are treating you as an adult.", "NTA\n\nI noticed that line your dad said, \"That's why shit like this keeps happening, because you don't want to listen.\" ... that particularly seems to be a line from men when they are in their toxic masculinity for when shit goes down.

It's all yours now if you want it, no parents to consider unless they have good advice - and it will be AMAZING.\n\nIt's going to be tough at first - breaking away is the hardest part, but once your parents realize you are serious, they'll have a choice - do they want a relationship on your terms, or none at all?\n\nDon't let them choose their terms again - they can't be trusted to treat you as an adult, so you have to stay as strong as you are right now until they see there's only one path forward.  \n\nGood luck setting boundaries; you'll be in a \"parental\" role for a while if my suspicions are correct.

Or they might just treat you like a child forever. Standing there and taking it will not change them for the better. I would suggest at least once telling them that treating you like a child is not working and something has to change. Leaving home is a great first step to show independence, but it won't change anything by itself.\n\nNTA. I hope your parents realize their mistake sooner rather than later.

Also, the grocery thing seemed like an honest mistake, but they seemed to treat it like a regular occurance. Maybe you're not always mindful, I don't know. \n\nAlso, You shouldn't say you're a really good driver. Getting your license at 18 means nothing. You're young, you're still a relatively new driver, and they're probably not used to handing over the wheel and letting their children drive.
