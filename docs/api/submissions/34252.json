R is currently based in California, and we are all based overseas. Rene wants us all to be bridesmaids and is also expecting us to plan the bachelorette party. While we were all close friends in high school, we have all grown a bit apart, and are not in frequent contact with Rene. While we all love her, our relationship has changed a bit from the \"best friends that are constantly together\" friendship that we had in high school.We calculated the cost of this wedding and have concluded that it will roughly take 3-4K USD overall for the trip, which would be minimum 5 days due to travel time. Rene has not offered to help us with the cost of the trip, and if we all go this will be a huge hit for us financially, and we would have to take multiple PTOs as well.\n\nIf Rene is not willing to pitch in, we realistically cannot go, but Rene seems to think that since we have been best friends for so long, we should be there for her special day. She has talked about wanting to have her wedding in California since we were teenagers, and we all know that her dream included us as her bridesmaids. We plan on telling her that while we love her, we cannot afford to go financially. We are worried that she will get offended that all of her bridesmaids do not think that her wedding is worth the time and effort.\n\nShe also comes from a very well-off family, as does her fianc\u00e9. She is currently in grad school and does not have an income. She has mentioned the fact that she is \"poor\" to us multiple times, but as she does not have experience working or growing up with an average income, she does not seem to understand how significant the cost of this trip would be for us.\n\nWe don't want to offend her or ruin our friendship, but our friendship is also not at a state where we can happily dish out 3-4K USD for her. I feel like putting this ultimatum on her, especially for something as important as her wedding could be an asshole move, especially as she does not have an income at the moment.

I don't understand the current entitlement of brides expecting their friends to give them parties and trips just because they are getting married. I got married two years ago and my SO and I made damn sure our wedding party paid as little as possible for the entirety of their service because standing next to someone for half an hour shouldn't cost you thousands of dollars.", "YWBTA. It\u2019s not her responsibility to pay for you. If you can\u2019t afford it, just tell her that. Tell her that you would love to attend but you can\u2019t afford it. Does she live in CA or close to where you are? If she lives close by, offer to plan a bachelorette party for her before she leaves for the wedding. Since she\u2019s planning a destination wedding, she should understand that not everyone will be able to make it. If she gets offended, that\u2019s on her. If she offers to help cover your ticket, that\u2019s great. But asking her to chip in is super tacky.", "NTA. I was in this predicament some years ago. Only I couldn\u2019t support my friend emotionally or financially for her wedding so I declined her invitation to be a part of her wedding party. Being the awesome friend that she is, she completely understood. She invited me because as my friend, she wanted me to have the opportunity to decide. What type of friend do you truly have if this worries you? I didn\u2019t worry once because I knew my friend would understand and she did.", "NTA, to a degree. If you really can\u2019t afford it, then tell her you can\u2019t be a bridesmaid. If you can partially afford it, tell her you\u2019d love to come and be honored to be a bridesmaid, but you can\u2019t swing the whole bachelorette schtick. Or that you can attend but can\u2019t be a bridesmaid. Just decide what you can afford and offer that level of involvement. If she offers to pony up, great. But telling her that she needs to pitch in\u2026 eh, that sounds a little obnoxious. I just never think it\u2019s nice to assume how well off other people are.", "NAH, verging on YTA. It IS the general expectation that the bridesmaids plan and pay for the bachelorette. If that's not feasible, then the plan needs to change. You can tell Rene that it's not something you can swing due to finances and she might offer to pitch in, but keep in mind she's also paying for the wedding. \n\nWould the bachelorette and the wedding be during the same trip? If so this isn't really about whether you can make a bachelorette party happen - it's about whether you can go to the wedding. And it IS unreasonable to ask a bride to pay for her guests to attend her wedding. The bachelorette can be something simple that doesn't add much to the total cost, but what you're saying about the length of the trip, PTO, etc would apply whether you were attending as a regular guest or attending to throw her a bachelorette. \n\nAdulthood is hard and sometimes you have to make uncomfortable choices. There is simply nobody in the world I love enough to spend $4,000 to go to their wedding except my immediate family. In this economy we've been declining more wedding invitations than we've been accepting, because travel + accomodations + food adds up quickly for a family of 3. \n\nShe doesn't have to pay for you to attend her wedding, but you also don't have to cripple yourself financially in order to attend. She probably shouldn't have made you her bridesmaids knowing you live abroad but that doesn't make her TA.", "OP: tell her you can\u2019t afford it, but leave the others out. They can tell her themselves. Then all of you can offer to plan a bachelorette party for her close to where you all live (if you are all near enough to each other) and she can come to you. Or offer to plan something for after her wedding, whenever she might be visiting your home country.", "Yeah, I'd approach the conversation as trying to find a mutual solution that falls in between the bridesmaids telling her 'if you really want us there you'll pay' and her telling the bridesmaids 'if you really cared you'd just figure it out.' Both are equally unrealistic so making it clear that you're looking for middle ground that works for everyone is the best approach", "I totally agree with this. NAH.\n\nI was in two weddings. For one, it was a high school friend. We are from NY and her wedding was there. I was living overseas at the time. She asked me to be her MOH, and I was so happy she did. I was able to fly over for the wedding, see some family, etc. I had the Bachelorette party a few days before the wedding since I was in NY at the time but I didn't make the other events. It went well. \n\nThe other was a friend from college. I was a bridesmaid in her wedding in Massachusetts while I was living in Colorado. I flew over for the wedding, did a road trip, etc. It was fun. I didn't make it to the other events because of the distance.\n\nIn both cases I was happy they asked me instead of assuming I would be offended if they did. In both cases I attended what I could and didn't attend what I couldn't. It all worked out. The OP makes it sound like it was rude of her friend for even asking and I think that is unfair. I also think its unfair to ask for the friend to pay for anything. If you can't go, just thank them for thinking of you but say you can't make it. Simple. If the friend has an issue with you not being able to afford it, then they would be at fault. But not for just asking.", "Yes, in the old days, it\u2019s ok to say \u201csorry, I can\u2019t afford that trip.\u201d  No harm. No foul.", "I do think a person is in the wrong for asking a group of people who live abroad to be bridesmaids and expecting traditional bridesmaid activities at their expense. \n\nExpecting people to fly back from overseas for a wedding and a bachelorette is an asshole expectation.", "But R is, a bit. Or at least totally unthinking. \"Hey, bunch of friends that I know are just starting out and can't afford a lot, please pay overseas plane tickets for my wedding, *and* bachelorette party, plus paying for your dress and all the other bits and bobs!\" It IS rude to ask that, without saying \"I know it might be a lot for you guys.\"  It's not like it's one bridesmaid, it's all of them. She's bascially having a destination wedding, which everyone on Reddit is always so salty about regarding cost.", "I think it's the way R will react. That if they really care they will.spend the money. I'm guessing by that statement from OP that R has done that before so the reaction expected is a guilt trip", "Maybe it\u2019s just me but expecting HS friends who you are not frequently in contact with to be part of your bridal party, requiring travel overseas and not even covering their dresses and shoes seems like very AH behavior.\n\nAlthough, I\u2019m firmly in the frame of mind that couple should be paying for rental or cost of clothing required for the wedding.", "This is the answer. It would be terribly tacky to imply that the bride is expected to pay OP's expenses, and OP should not take it on herself to speak for others. Politely decline the invitation, send the best wishes (and if OP wants, a gift/card), and move on.\n\nNow if the friend comes back and gives OP a hard time for not being able to afford this, that changes my opinion, but at this point the only AH move by anyone would be to demand others shell out thousands of dollars.", "This is a lovely response.", "In fairness, I'm middle class and still wouldn't put down $4k to attend a friend's wedding. It's fine if OP doesn't want to find a way to pay for it. But she should just say so instead of asking her friend for money or saying none of the other bridesmaids will go either.", "This is pure nonsense. People can\u2019t just come up with money they don\u2019t have. They can\u2019t just make 4K+ appear out of nowhere. You can\u2019t just \u201cfind a way\u201d to have money that isn\u2019t there.", "This.  Let each of the bridesmaids speak for themselves.  No need for it to feel like talk age ganging up on her.", "And then we get this post \n\n\u201cAITA because my friend didn\u2019t ask me to be in their bridal party because I live overseas\u201d. \n\nNo one is expecting, you ask someone to be in it and they can decline.", "Hard disagree, nothing wrong with asking and no such thing as an asshole expectation. What makes someone an AH is how they react when their ask is declined or the expectation is not fulfilled. If they react with love and ubderstanding no harm no foul. I would much rather be asked and feel included, even if I can't make it.", "That\u2019s just a huge assumption - we only know OP\u2019s perspective here and she did not detail all the conversations  they had. \n\nWe dont need to go on fishing expeditions on every post to find AHs", "I agree, it is a lot of money and the bride is expecting a lot. My point was more that close friends are more likely to be willing to spend that kind of money and OP doesn\u2019t seem to consider her a close friend anymore.", "It\u2019s not nonsense. She didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t have the money. Just that she didn\u2019t want to fork out that amount of money and take the time off.", "From OP\u2019s post she is expecting. She said that Rene does expect them to plan the bachelorette party and that she seems to think that because they have been friends so long they should be there.", "OP does say that her friend comes from a wealthy background and has never had to worry about paying for stuff like people who actually work for their own living. And if her friend had said anything about the cost, why would OP be making this post at all? Which was the point of *my* post.", "Agreed. I get the sense the friend won't understand that financially, going is not possible. She doesn't seem to understand that destination weddings mean some people won't be able to make it. Also, I think it's tacky the bride has family money but is asking the friends to shell out so much money.", "Have you been in a wedding party? That is how they work, by definition. \n\nBut still OP is a-okay to simply, decline.", "It\u2019s expected to plan a bachelorette party when you accept the responsibility of being in the wedding party, not just because they are friends.", ">There is a difference between asking a bridesmaid or groomsmen to pay for a dress/suit, shower gift and help plan a REASONABLY priced bachelor/bachelorette party and what this bride is asking.\n\nThe thing is what counts as \"reasonably priced\" changes from person to person\n\nI don't think someone is ever made an AH for simply *asking* something, it's how they respond to a \"no\" that dictates whether or not they're an arsehole", "Theyre *asking* them to \u201cplunk down\u201d. \n\nI know some like to assume anything a person getting married does is some AH ask but it is still, an ask. Not an expectation until proven otherwise.", "There may be missing info but I don\u2019t see anywhere that states what the bridesmaids are expected to pay for that equates to 4K. I can fly from Australia to California for under 1K for example and that\u2019s quite a distance. Bachelorette party shouldn\u2019t cost more than a couple hundred dollars per bridesmaid and tbh I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid twice and never spent that much as the guests contributed for some things (like splitting venue or transport hire etc). Bride usually pays for the dress and hair and makeup and generally accomodation the night before. I\u2019ve never been involved in a destination wedding but would assume she should cover accomodation for her wedding party and immediate family (it\u2019s quite common to have rooms at a hotel booked or a resort booked).\n\nMaybe my experience hasn\u2019t been the norm but the brides I\u2019ve bridesmaided for have had the attitude we want you in our wedding party because we love you and you\u2019re important to us not as a bank and we don\u2019t want you to be financially put out by this so we will cover most things.", "You literally said \u201cno one is expecting\u201d. So if you acknowledge that\u2019s how wedding parties work then you acknowledge that she is expecting that.", "So then the person I replied to saying \u201cno one is expecting\u201d was false which is the point.", "Asking your friends to drop $5k on literally anything makes you an ass", "The person you replied to is talking about two separate things. You ask someone to be in the party, they can decline. There is a choice there. Once you accept you are then expected to do all the things involved in being in a bridal party like planning the bachelorette party", "That is completely subjective. \n\nIm going on an international birthday trip next week for 11 days. I was happy to be invited.", "Have you ever been in a wedding before? It is a well-known *fact* that it will cost money. \n\nPresumably, OP knew that her friend was having her wedding in California. If you ask to be in the wedding party, and you know the wedding will be at X destination, it's pretty obvious that you will need to get yourself there. \n\nIf OP can't afford to go, she can't afford to go, and that's okay. It was an invitation, not a summons.", "Thank you - once these post get some traction people will go to any length to try to call people AHs.", "It\u2019s not two separate things. \n\nBy asking, you are asking them to a. Fly overseas to for the wedding, b. Be a bridesmaid which has day of wedding expenses and c. Fly, potentially overseas again, for the bachelorette which has a bunch of expenses. \n\nAsking multiple people who live abroad to shell out what will likely be 3-5k IS an asshole ask imo. Especially if it didn\u2019t come with an explicit and genuine statement of understanding that it would be a financial stretch for them.", "It\u2019s an ask, not a demand. It is acceptable to consider all of those things and decline.", "Yes, and it\u2019s an ASSHOLE ask.", "No AHoles here. Many people from money don\u2019t have any concept of what things cost.", "So, you all were BFs in high school but haven\u2019t really been in close contact with R in the past 8-9 years. And you all are overseas except for R. I would think R would have made other friends in all that time? It doesn\u2019t make sense because getting dresses, having the shower, the bachelorette party, rehearsals etc. are things bridesmaids usually arrange or participate in. A minimum time of 5 days isn\u2019t sufficient.", "NTA for not wanting to go into debt to be a bridesmaid but you need to be very careful about the rest.   \nI wouldn't ask for help, I would just very carefully explain to her that this is not a personal rejection but you simply cannot afford the expenses associated with being in the wedding party or even attending the wedding. Don't get sucked into a conversation or attempt to justify your decision.", "If you can't afford to make a long trip to another country be bridesmaids, tell her you can't afford to be bridesmaids.  \n\nJust tell her separately.  If you all tell her together, she'll feel like the group is ganging up on her, so tell her one at a time that you're embarrassed to admit that you just can't afford the money or PTO it would take to fulfill her plans.  You can even ask her not to tell the others.", "NTA but definitely approach the conversation with care. Make your boundaries clear, what you can and can't afford, and why you can't make it work. Express how disappointed and sorry you are. If she is well off and really wants you to come, I imagine she will offer to help foot part of the bill. I agree with the others - be sure to have these conversations with her separately, otherwise it may feel like a group attack. \n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA, be honest, you cannot afford it. It is unrealistic for someone to expect friends to pay even $1000 to participate in their wedding. If the couple wants that kind of wedding then they should finance it or get richer friends.

It sounds a little like you\u2019ve all conspired together to manipulate her to pay your way. I think instead you each individually need to have a conversation where you communicate how much this will cost and that you can\u2019t afford to come. It\u2019s really not up to you to suggest or infer that she pitch in. She can come to that conclusion easily on her own if it\u2019s something she can afford to do.

A friend that refuses to accept no (with well wishes) for an answer is not a friend. Especially when it's regarding such a huge request.
