R is currently based in California, and we are all based overseas. Rene wants us all to be bridesmaids and is also expecting us to plan the bachelorette party. While we were all close friends in high school, we have all grown a bit apart, and are not in frequent contact with Rene. While we all love her, our relationship has changed a bit from the \"best friends that are constantly together\" friendship that we had in high school.We calculated the cost of this wedding and have concluded that it will roughly take 3-4K USD overall for the trip, which would be minimum 5 days due to travel time. Rene has not offered to help us with the cost of the trip, and if we all go this will be a huge hit for us financially, and we would have to take multiple PTOs as well.\n\nIf Rene is not willing to pitch in, we realistically cannot go, but Rene seems to think that since we have been best friends for so long, we should be there for her special day. She has talked about wanting to have her wedding in California since we were teenagers, and we all know that her dream included us as her bridesmaids. We plan on telling her that while we love her, we cannot afford to go financially. We are worried that she will get offended that all of her bridesmaids do not think that her wedding is worth the time and effort.\n\nShe also comes from a very well-off family, as does her fianc\u00e9. She is currently in grad school and does not have an income. She has mentioned the fact that she is \"poor\" to us multiple times, but as she does not have experience working or growing up with an average income, she does not seem to understand how significant the cost of this trip would be for us.\n\nWe don't want to offend her or ruin our friendship, but our friendship is also not at a state where we can happily dish out 3-4K USD for her. I feel like putting this ultimatum on her, especially for something as important as her wedding could be an asshole move, especially as she does not have an income at the moment.

Here\u2019s the thing. I would just message or call her and mention that you can\u2019t make the trip financially, but do NOT phrase it as \u201ceither you pay or we don\u2019t go\u201d because that will obviously be taken the wrong way.

If she comes to that conclusion and offers there would be no reason not to go with the exception of the time off work.  To tell her or ask her to pay all or part of your expenses would be an AH move when you don\u2019t have to.  Good luck.", "NAH- But you seem to be very naive. \n\nIf you cant afford the costs associated with being in the wedding, you can and absolutely say no.\n\nBut your post comes off like R is somehow in the wrong for asking you and I think that kind of makes you an AH for framing it like that.", "NTA if you cannot afford to go, but you would be the AH if you made an ultimatum to your friend.

Maybe try talking to her and explaining your financial concerns? But if that doesn't work, then yeah probably best not to go.

This is not the way to handle it.", "Info: Are you bridesmaids a package deal (all or nothing) or are you writing from a point if conspiracy?

You really hate to miss it all.", "NAH But say you can't afford to go don't speak for everyone else let them do it them self.", "NTA, but you shouldn't frame it like that.

If you can\u2019t afford it, fine tell her that but it\u2019s not a bride\u2019s job to pay your travel expenses. Even if her family is well off, it doesn\u2019t mean your friend is.

I think you're taking a lot of responsibility for the actions of others, though. Its not under your control what decisions the other bridesmaids make and you don't have to feel guilty for them.
