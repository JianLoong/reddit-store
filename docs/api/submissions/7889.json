What your brother did was a slap in the face to your dad as well as extremely bad financially for himself.  Also, it seems very likely that a chunk of the money your brother lost was money given to him by your mom and dad, and other family members, and not just money he may have earned himself.  It may have been your brother's money legally, but it was money gifted to him by his family to be used for his future and he utterly squandered it.

I can imagine what he feels when he's a professional money manager and seeing his own son do something honestly quite stupid financially and against even basic financial sense would make him feel disappointed and angry, probably at himself most of all. My dad was in a similar profession and took every tiny financial misstep I made as a new adult deeply personally... but lectured me / yelled at me similarly.\n\nScreaming at your dad also did not help, and you said hurtful things like wanting to cut him off. \n\nYour brother has shown he's not a responsible adult with his money (ie, investing all his savings in a volatile asset without diversifying/being able to handle losses), and while I'm sure he feels bad, he really should be using some sort of financial planner and/or tools (perhaps not your dad) to make better choices with his money.\n\nYou say your father acted terribly to your brother \"for no reason,\" but I think what you mean is he overreacted... as there is a VERY good reason why he was upset/disappointed. Since you live with your dad... it may be worth apologizing for yelling, and asking your dad if it's possible he got mad at your brother because he was disappointed since he is a financial advisor.

I don't blame your dad for being frustrated however I also don't think the way he handled it was great either. It would have been better to calmly tell his son that the important thing is if he has learned from his mistake. Yes, he has screwed up but he is young, can save up again and recover from this. Next time, diversify and only put a small percentage of your savings that you can afford to lose in risky investments. It seems like the world is ending now but he will eventually look back on this and be grateful he learnt this at 23 and not later on when he could lose his house and retirement. He won't make the same mistake again so he can move forward from this. Parenting is hard and I have certainly had my \"I told you it would end this way, why would you do that??\" reactions in the moment but it really isn't helpful. I have had to then go back to my kids, apologise for not handling the news well and discuss the situation more rationally. It would be nice if you could shelter your kids from making mistakes but the reality is, sometimes kids need to make their own mistakes just like we ignored our parents and learnt the hard way. It is part of growing up. \n\nOP also did not handle this well. Lashing out and being hurtful isn't a mature way of handling a very emotional and tense situation. I can also understand your reaction but you are essentially doing what your dad does - lashing out verbally under pressure. You should never say things like that just to hurt people. It is better to say why don't we discuss then when we all cool down as this isn't helping anything. And then leave with your brother. You are also young and handling tense situations are a learned skill. Is your mum able to mediate an apology between the two of you? Sometimes it can help having someone else that your dad will listen to talk to him about it and help you both apologise. Otherwise, you will need to broach this yourself. Tell him that you should not have said you can't wait until you never have to see him again.

I applaud you for standing up to your brother especially since your dad yelling at him was almost causing him to cry. I'm an only child but I know what getting yelled like that used to feel like for me and how I wished someone would step in and stop my mother from yelling at me like that but I had no one so I had to do it myself.", "NAH, your dad was allowed to be shocked, angry disappointed everything. But ultimately he should want what is best for you two and deal with those emotions himself. \nSaying \"wow, thats dumb. I specifically told you not to, wtf.\" Is not helpfull, but you should not be surprised or angry it slips out. Badgering was not oke, but I can't tell from what you told that that happened. If he continued for to long then he is the AH.\nIt sounds like there are longstanding issues with this dude and your complaint is not isolated to this incident. Might be time to take a look at your situation amd figure out if you can move, if you will be oke living with him for a bit longer and if you can take some responsibility of this father daughter relationship if you want it to last. Parent-child relationships are complicated, but you are both adults now. You are also able to change things before they escalate (unless it is a extremely manipulative, dismissive guy maybe).", "Right?! Dad might as well just kick her out if he wants to lol", "I laughed so hard at this! Honestly, I\u2019d throw both of them out.", "In civilized countries, laws in case OP is studying.", "So much this. How cruel of OP to treat her father like a cash machine just good enough to give and keep giving until he\u2019s thrown away. OP do you really see your father like this because that comment was a slap in his face. He worked his whole life to provide for you, expressed frustration because his kid didn\u2019t listen to sound advice, and his other kid just stabs him in the heart with those hurtful words. Your brother did take  an expensive lesson indeed, what was Dad supposed to do when he heard his advice was not listened to?\n\nAnd you OP, if you\u2019re all that, at 22 you wouldn\u2019t be financially dependent on him. You have the gal to treat him like garbage, yet you still need him. Go on then, go make your own money. If your father wanted to teach you another lesson he\u2019d kick your freeloading entitled ass to the streets too. But he loves you, and he\u2019s still there for you.\n\nGO APOLOGISE. Now. \nETA judgment :  YTA", "Especially since OP is 22 years old and still sponging off Dad. \n\nDad, if you find this thread, cut this ingrate off.", "\"I know better than you, *dad!* You may have a degree, but I listened to Logan Paul talk about crypto for fifteen minutes, so who's the **real** financial wizard here?\"", "Yeah, but on the other hand some ppl just need to do the mistake themself to really learn from it. Why else would ppl do stuff others already did and everybody could knew its not gonna work out. \n\nThe son only harmed himself. An \"i told you so\" isn't really helpful when its obvious the other person already know they messed up. So i understand why you wouldn't confide in this person the next time something goes wrong. What op told her father about not having empathy was most likely true. Yes, dad knew it better, yes, son f*cked up. But if dad loves son, why try so hard to make him feel even worse? He already knows to not do the same mistake again.", "And she said her father was saying things that were not helpful, well when he told them helpful shit the brother ignored him so...YTA", ">the guy is a grown ass man and invested his own money. Why does dad even get a say in this? He learned the hard way, like an adult, so what's the purpose in daddy dressing him down like a teenager?\n\nBruh he still lives with his father he basically is a dependent who needs to get his shit straight. If you arent financially independent I think of you as a child", "Durr lol", "I think the cause was his child ignoring him and his wisdom and losing lots of money on a scam.", "I think you should be shamed if you do something egregiously stupid", ">He doesn't need your dad's help\n\nuhhhhh kinda sounds like he does.", "it\u2019d be one thing if it was just his mistake to make but I think there\u2019s a good chance that the brother is still financially dependent", "I think when a child makes an egregiously stupid decision then they deserved a dressing down and a lecture from a competent adult", "seems like your dad knew in advance", "If only he had a financial advisor who could help direct him\u2026\n\nYTA", "He got tricked by snake oil salesman he needs a dressing down from a competent adult", "With respect, literally everyone on the internet was screaming from the rooftops what it dumb, bad, short-sighted \"investment\" was from the very beginning.

Or...you know, listened to his financial advisor dad, an expert he gets free advice from?", "He literally could have known because your father, who is a financial advisor, specifically warned against investing in crypto. Your brother knowingly ignored sound advice and invested in crypto, which is risky at best.", "Apparently people on AITA today think it is okay to kick someone when they are down. Your brother will have learned his lesson, this is a self punishing \"crime\", there is nothing positive about being an  unsupportive parent when the lesson has already been learned and this should not be about your father's ego.

Not a teen", "You basically got mad at your dad for being angry that his son fell for an obvious scam that resulted in lots of money being lost. I don't see a way to spin this where the father is the AH", "It\u2019s not really an \u2018i told you so\u2019 since the dad included actual advice on how to do it differently going forward. And if someone bet all/a lot of their money on crypto in the first place i don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the realm of possibility that they\u2019ll try it again, just look at any gambler, so you cant really say \u2018he already knows not to do it again.\u2019\n\nThe dad may not have given his sound advice in a way you would\u2019ve preferred, but the brother needed to hear it", "He lost a load of money, which probably was given to him in the first place. \n\nThought he knew better and spaffed it up the wall. His feelings don\u2019t matter, he needs to learn a life lesson like yesterday. \n\nIf daddy wasn\u2019t loaded, this kid would be fucked for the next decade or so off that fuck up. \n\nRich kids need to learn responsibility to, can\u2019t just be brats being bailed out all the time.", "Sometimes yelling at your kids is justified.  This is one of those times.", "Idk about counseling. Think about that argument happening in real time. The dad didn't even say anything particularly offensive.

W Dad imo.", "He should have talked to a financial advisor...", "I was referring to OP saying \u201cthis is why we never confide in you\u201d\n\nSounds like dad has a history of reacting poorly, even before the brother\u2019s bad investment.", "I was still financially dependent on my mother when she told me \"You're just like your fucking father\" I think I was somewhere between 16 and 20 when she told me that during one of her tirades.", "And I think when an ADULT makes a mistake (I believe that OP said her brother was 25) that they should be able to learn from it.", "idk what that has to do with a father yelling at a financially dependent son about an incredibly stupid financial decision   \n   \nLike imagine your parent sends you money to pay for college tuition and you gamble it all away. My dad would rip me a new one for that", "If I made an error at work I should and would receive some beratement from my boss, that doesn't make my boss an AH. just my opinion.\n\nI think the fact he is an \"adult\" (even tho he lives at home and is dependent) makes it even more stupid.

I didn't bother responding back, there is no convincing fools not to waste their money.", "Sounds like he could have benefited a lot from a professional\u2014like a financial advisor. But no, he decided that he knew better. \n\nHe was stupid and got burned.", "You never invest more than you are willing to straight-up lose. That's Investing 101.

OP and her brother sound like spoiled brats who rely on the dad to bail them out of their screwups and don\u2019t like to be told they screwed up.\n\nIf expressing frustration that your kid, whom you financially support, ignores your advice and now you will have to cover the cost is abusive, then OP is also abusive since she cheerfully admits to screaming at her dad (while leeching off him).\n\nUsing the word \u201cabuse\u201d to describe what the dad did is incredibly offensive to victims of actually parental abuse.", "Yes but kids and young adults PUSH BOUNDARIES it's our job until we know better.

It could have very easily been something from $1 to $1 Million. I think if he only invested $100 it's easily repaid to Father Dearest. But like you said we don't know the amount so with not knowing the amount I'm still sticking with my decision of NTA. Come at me all you want.", "OP says he lost a lot of money and has been depressed about it since then (probably about a year and a half) so given his age, it\u2019s presumably much much more than a couple hundred dollars.
