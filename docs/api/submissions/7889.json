What your brother did was a slap in the face to your dad as well as extremely bad financially for himself.  Also, it seems very likely that a chunk of the money your brother lost was money given to him by your mom and dad, and other family members, and not just money he may have earned himself.  It may have been your brother's money legally, but it was money gifted to him by his family to be used for his future and he utterly squandered it.

I can imagine what he feels when he's a professional money manager and seeing his own son do something honestly quite stupid financially and against even basic financial sense would make him feel disappointed and angry, probably at himself most of all. My dad was in a similar profession and took every tiny financial misstep I made as a new adult deeply personally... but lectured me / yelled at me similarly.\n\nScreaming at your dad also did not help, and you said hurtful things like wanting to cut him off. \n\nYour brother has shown he's not a responsible adult with his money (ie, investing all his savings in a volatile asset without diversifying/being able to handle losses), and while I'm sure he feels bad, he really should be using some sort of financial planner and/or tools (perhaps not your dad) to make better choices with his money.\n\nYou say your father acted terribly to your brother \"for no reason,\" but I think what you mean is he overreacted... as there is a VERY good reason why he was upset/disappointed. Since you live with your dad... it may be worth apologizing for yelling, and asking your dad if it's possible he got mad at your brother because he was disappointed since he is a financial advisor.

I don't blame your dad for being frustrated however I also don't think the way he handled it was great either. It would have been better to calmly tell his son that the important thing is if he has learned from his mistake. Yes, he has screwed up but he is young, can save up again and recover from this. Next time, diversify and only put a small percentage of your savings that you can afford to lose in risky investments. It seems like the world is ending now but he will eventually look back on this and be grateful he learnt this at 23 and not later on when he could lose his house and retirement. He won't make the same mistake again so he can move forward from this. Parenting is hard and I have certainly had my \"I told you it would end this way, why would you do that??\" reactions in the moment but it really isn't helpful. I have had to then go back to my kids, apologise for not handling the news well and discuss the situation more rationally. It would be nice if you could shelter your kids from making mistakes but the reality is, sometimes kids need to make their own mistakes just like we ignored our parents and learnt the hard way. It is part of growing up. \n\nOP also did not handle this well. Lashing out and being hurtful isn't a mature way of handling a very emotional and tense situation. I can also understand your reaction but you are essentially doing what your dad does - lashing out verbally under pressure. You should never say things like that just to hurt people. It is better to say why don't we discuss then when we all cool down as this isn't helping anything. And then leave with your brother. You are also young and handling tense situations are a learned skill. Is your mum able to mediate an apology between the two of you? Sometimes it can help having someone else that your dad will listen to talk to him about it and help you both apologise. Otherwise, you will need to broach this yourself. Tell him that you should not have said you can't wait until you never have to see him again.

Programs we were pressured to apply for because of the financial advantages of these careers. Hers is actually in his field. His old fucking office. \n\nAnd no one really took me seriously until recently, now that my mom is finally leaving him, because he has completely lost control of his persona and is being a flat-out clinical emotionally manipulative, stalking, threatening basket case.

He never did. Just argued back or gave me the silent treatment until I felt guilty).\n- No subsequent attempt by their father to actually have a conversation about what brought about OP\u2019s comment and OP mentioning that silence has been the response \n- OP then feeling guilty about it later because of everything he does to support them financially \n- Everyone in the comments immediately fixating on the brother\u2019s obviously stupid crypto move and OP\u2019s deliberately biting comment but overlooking the fact that dad was being extremely immature and egotistical in his response regardless\n\n**Now I know that\u2019s just my experience, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the case here, but my experience is enough to make me consider the possibility that this dynamic goes much deeper than this instance.**", " Because I was high", "OP is hungry.", "Mom doesn't have a pool?", "The money might not \"be dad's\" in the sense dad handed Son $50k to invest but it's almost 100% likely dad's in the sense \"you don't have to pay rent, tuition , whatever other expense dad is covering. so that you can save for a house , invest your earnings\"", "Did you really type that his feelings don't matter?

Why are you even still depending on your dad if you know everything better lol", "Dad needs to kick her out now and let her figure it out by herself!", "Yeah, I hope he cuts her off immediately since she just told him that she is only using him for his money. \n\nYTA", "Doesn't seem to realize that dad cared enough to warn them about crypto. He took the time to talk to them about it because he cared and wanted the best for them. This was a hard learning experience for your brother. The older he gets the less people are going to coddle him for doing stupid. Hopefully he learns from this life lesson. Mom may say it is okay but it actually isn't. The only good thing is that your brother is young enough to start over but losing a large sum of money will always cut the amount of money he has. The growth he would have had on that money will never exist. The harm is permanent. Maybe your mom should care more.", "OP's right, though - what good does any of that do other than make him feel like shit? A good parent would be there to support, not to yell and belittle their child. \n\nReally surprised this is the top comment.", "> Did you ever consider how insulting it is to your dad that he, an expert of probably decades, got ignored by his own son?\n\nIf someone got so personally insulted that they yelled and berated me if I did not take their advice, I would probably be low-contact/carefully limited contact with them.  I mean, how much of an ego do you have if you are insulted just because someone made the choice to decline your advice?", "Dad\u2019s comments seem very mild.", "Even that\u2019s wrong. \nLike the dad mentioned it\u2019s diversify in mutual funds. Don\u2019t even care about current price because you have no way to know when the high and low for buying is - theoretically when it comes time to sell it\u2019s going to be higher anyway.\n\nTimes of recession/low prices are simply a time to get a discount and buy more.\n\nI put money in mutual funds. I never actually look/care about the ticker prices - because the day to day/ month to month movement doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nI sometimes do options - but that\u2019s more about collecting premiums. Only rarely will I do options as a quick investment.", ">If they were strangers, dad would probably laugh\n\nAs a stranger, I agree (yta)", "Also if they\u2019re both financially dependent on their dad that brings up 2 things to me \n\n1. Her brother viewed the money as kind of disposable and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t take his dad seriously \n2. The money he lost was actually *dad\u2019s* money that was given to him", "This. People say op is the TA but the father shouldn't be constantly berating his song, it is really not helpful. Advice was given, consequences happened, lesson (hopefully) learned. The way OP's handled it is assholish but I can imagine blowing up like that in this situation.\nESH is the correct classification, imho.", "I think that's how OP meant it.", "I said the exact same thing! I mean if I was OP and I was considering investing, the first thing I would do is go to my dad and ask for advice on what stocks I would be good to use for my first investment", "OP is 22 if her Dad was truly awful she would have become financially independent and moved out at this point.  Instead she is living at home and acting like a spoiled teen because her brother was called out for his mistake.  I think the Dad probably overreacted but I don\u2019t think coddling a 23 year old man\u2019s major financial mistakes is proper parenting either.  He\u2019s young and still living at home so he\u2019ll recover from this but he should be feeling bad and learning a lesson from this.", "I mean, sure, you need to learn your own lessons. But part of the lesson might be getting an earful from your parents for fucking up after they tried to tell you (with an expert opinion on top!) how to do things smart.\n\nMaybe it's the loss itself that sticks, or the way his ears will burn every time he thinks of that moment.", "Who said she was an absentee mom? Just because they're discussing things at his home, doesn't mean they are always there and never see their mother.", "\u2026that part is not weird. Not sure what country you live in but people don\u2019t exactly get a job when they\u2019re 18 and move out. I got my first job at 16 and worked all through college, still didn\u2019t get fully off the tit until 24ish. I have friends  around my age ( I\u2019m 32) that their parents still pay a bill or two. Welcome to America!", "It\u2019s just a new form of Ponzi scheme, with the benefit of not having to pay fake \u201creturns\u201d.", "And gets his sister to fight his battles. \n\nHonestly he\u2019s clearly not capable of managing anything", "To me constantly rubbing salt in the wound is asshole behaviour if it was really that much.", "Are ya winning, son?", "I\u2019m 26 and desperately looking for a job so I can move out", "A genuinely empathetic parent will never validate you if you're being mean or callous towards your other parent, period. Let alone in a scenario where you're clearly in the wrong.\n\nThe fact that OP is confused if what she did to her dad was right or wrong is a red flag for me. If the mom was really the empathetic parent, she would've already heard them out and asked OP to apologize to her dad first. \n\nNo one is saying dad was right in handling this the way he did. Clearly, there were more ideal ways to do this but we don't know his parenting journey. It can be very hard to co-parent with someone who wants to be the \"nice one\" without being the \"responsible one.\" That how it is coming across to me from the info given so far.", "But again - it doesn't say the mom validated what she said. She said this is why they confide in her when they have problems. I realize I view this differently because it hits close to home for me, but that's something my siblings and I have ALL expressed. Never did it mean that our dad was validating us being mean to her, because he never did and never would do that; it meant it was hard to not be able to be vulnerable with her about certain things. \n\nI don't find it all that odd that OP is confused. If she grew up in a house where flying off the handle and losing your temper and belittling others over mistakes is normal, it could be that she genuinely didn't realize that would cross a line.", "Yeah, I guess our subjective experiences are probably colouring how we view this. Without more info, there is no way to break the logjam. And like you said, she's not coming back. So here we are.", "Right? He should've kept it, it's going to go further up in the future and he wouldn't have lost that much money or maybe nothing at all, that is if he bought some of the bigger coins and not scammy fakes. And if he doesn't believe in that, he shouldn't have bought it then.", "not only that but having his son throw away all his money now means he will be living at home and sucking on the teat of mom and dad for several years longer than if he hadn't done that\n\nher brother didn't just throw away \"his\" money... he threw away the family's money.", "OP is in their 20s. If they really cared, they could move out. They're not stuck teenagers. Dad is probably close to being over supporting them", "100%! Take my broke person\u2019s award \ud83e\udd47", "Well said. If the dad had some level of emotional intelligence he would sense his son already in pain. The experience of making a stupid mistake is the punishment.\n\nIf it was clear the son was still delusional and not punishing himself enough then his reaction would be more appropriate.", "\"Naff off\"?  Never heard that one, I love it!", "I don't know - losing a good portion of one's savings has a way of concentrating the mind.", "Because when something crashes you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s at rock bottom or rock bottom *so far*.", "Because when you buy, you don't know it's the peak and then later on you don't know if you hit the bottom or if it's going to going lower.", "\"don't worry my adult child, you'll get them next time. Here's a huge check\"", "I feel like there is more we don't know. Don't get me wrong, OP totally is AH, but I feel like both siblings reacted based on much more than just this incident. Seems like maybe ESH, we are only seeing a small part of it to call out OP for it. \n\nOr I could be wrong and Dad is as fine as he seems and the kids just suck.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "At 22. I\u2019d be kicking OPs shit talking ass to the curb.", "ok we\u2019re not gonna act like it\u2019s not his responsibility as a parent to feed and clothe her. we\u2019re not gonna hold that part over her head when it doesn\u2019t matter", "This is the way.", "Yes, and adopt me instead. YTA", "Thw fact she said her dad didn't even apologize to the brother, as if the brother was the one entitled to an apology,  just blows my mind", "He just assumed a whole ass first world country would go bankrupt?\n\nWas he a forex trader or a Wall Street bets user with a forex account? ;)", "My parents would have put me out on my ass that minute. Especially at 22. You can earn a living", "Honestly I don't think you're a parent. My kids and most of the people I know have had kids that have said things in anger, but the only parents that I know that would cut off your kids are bad parents.", "Lol, have you been paying attention to the state of things?", "Right? For a second I thought maybe their dad just had to pay child support, but then I recalled that they are over 21 lol", "I don\u2019t know how it is where you live, but where I live, your parents are obligated by law to provide for you until you finish your first job training or get your first higher Ed degree. That might be until you\u2019re well over 25. Don\u2019t shoot the messenger :D\n\nEdit: I really don\u2019t understand the downvotes\u2026 I\u2019m not making a judgment or saying that OP is right I\u2019m just stating that everyone assumes that the father can simply stop supporting her, which may be possible in the states but not so in other countries and we don\u2019t know where she lives.", "No I absolutely get the reference and it gave me a good laugh \ud83d\ude02", "Yes I have. And still, at 22 if you have someone paying your way you better not bite the hand that's feeding you over sometime like your idiot brother getting a lecture about his idiot moves that he was warned by his financial professional father over to begin with.", "Here in the US they can kick you out before the smoke from the 18th Birthday cake candles finish dissipating.", "Oh my god.  It feels refreshing to see the comments in this thread.\n\nTwitter and Reddit can be such an echo chamber it\u2019s good to see a lot of people aren\u2019t dry humping crypto.", "Yeah, I'm really confused on where the \"absentee\" part is coming from. I've read it like 4 times.\n\nIs it because OP said she's financially dependent on dad? That still doesn't mean the mom is absent. Kids are financially dependent on both parents, but like in my case, we technically have 50/50 but my daughter spends most of her time at my house. However, her dad makes waaay, waaaaayyyyyy more money than I do and while I do my best to give her everything she needs plus some to keep her comfortable, she still has to get things from her dad sometimes and he gives her money for going out and doing things, so she definitely depends on him financially, too, because I can't afford to give her the kind of money that he can.\n\nSo that seems like a wild assumption if that's where it's coming from.", "For every American that has your experience there is one like me with that of the opposite, even if you don\u2019t know any.\n\nAnd to be clear, I was implying it was weird to be so *petulant* while being financially dependent.", "Dad sounds like a bully. And it depends on what the hand that feeds you is doing. Paying for food means a guy can treat me how he wants to?\nIs that what you're saying?", ">And he will hear it again every thanksgiving dinner or equivalent in his country for the rest of his life because he deserves to hear it.\n\nThis is where you are completely wrong. One financial investing mistake made by a 24 yo will not ruin his life ffs. He should not have to listen to someone rag on him for the rest of his life for losing a couple thousand dollars. I really hope at 41 you don't have kids because they'll probably grow to hate you if you just bring up every mistake they've ever made when you talk to them.", "I mean she said in the post he's been beating himself up for weeks because he knew he was wrong and then the dad found out and ripped into him. He started crying at the barrage and because he already felt bad so his sister stuck up for him.", "That\u2019s why I commented. Because the comment section simply assumes it\u2019s the US. All I tried to say, is, that it\u2019s different in other places.", "I\u2019d love to hear your secret. What field are you in? And considering more than 50% of the population makes under 60k a year I\u2019ll bet my full life there aren\u2019t \u201cjust as many\u201d people under 25 as there are you.\n\nThere are kids who\u2019s parents help them, and kids who have a skill and get a good job. Everyone else struggles.", "No, I'm saying that instead of going nuclear like she did she should have started with \"dad, he feels bad enough right now, please stop\" and then leaving the house. Or she can do what millions of other 22 year olds not relying on their dad's money so and get some roommates and work while going to school and dealing with the financial fallout."]}
