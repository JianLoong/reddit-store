{"id": 11202, "submission_id": "11f3eyw", "title": "AITA for asking my roommate to leave after she told me to suck it up and stood me up?", "selftext": "AITA; I (32F) own a home. A friend (33F) asked to move in for 6 months after her divorce. She's a teacher and doesn't make much. I'm an engineer and make double, so I set a low monthly rent ($400) for my area ($2000). We're now on year two of her living with me, and I spend a lot of money to help support her. \n\nRecently her sister (33F) who is also a teacher was evicted from her home. I offered to let the sister, her husband (34M), and son (5M) stay in my home while they found other arrangements.\n\nThings went well for almost two months. Then I was in a hit and run motorcycle accident. I drove myself to the hospital, but my friend met me there and wouldn't leave. She brought snacks and drinks, but the doctor told me not to eat or drink until my injuries were imaged. She kept forcing me to eat and drink, saying she was a \"tiger mom\". We'd been there for 7 hrs, it was 10 pm, and we had work the next morning. Her sister surprised us at the hospital and came in with high energy and her young son who immediately started trying to touch my bleeding wound. I asked that the two of them leave the room (I'm sobbing, concussed, and don't want a 5 yo poking at my road rash.) The sister's offended, but leaves. While we were waiting for the doctor my friend was complaining about it being late so I ended up leaving without being discharged to make her happy.\n\nI was in so much pain and stressed. My friend left that weekend to see her boyfriend and only messaged once to ask if I could move furniture out of my \"room\" (it's a converted garage; I gave her sister my room) when I couldn't walk well.\n\n5days after the accident I was getting terrible headaches and dramatic mood swings. She and her sister are very sensitive and I tried to stay away from them so I wouldn't offend them.\n\nWork, fighting with the police, lawyers, and insurance makes my concussion symptoms worse. I came home late from work one evening and she wanted to talk. I asked if we could another day. She knocked on my door until I came out, then she told me she was pissed at me for not communicating and that it's offensive to her culture. She said everyone has their own struggles and priorities in life. After an hour she felt better and let me go to bed, where I had a mental break down. The next morning, I asked her not to do that again while I'm recovering.\n\nShe stopped talking to me. Last weekend we had plans to see a play, NICE tickets gifted by my dad. She said she'd be there. 15 minutes before the show I asked where she was. No response. I messaged her boyfriend and he said she decided to cosplay instead. She had confirmed with me days earlier then stood me up so I couldn't bring anyone else.\n\nThat was it. I asked her to move out by the end of the week; she said she'd be out by the next day, and was. I needed a safe space to recover and I couldn't do that with her glaring at me and slamming doors. \n\nAITA for asking my roommate to move out?\n\nUpdate 1: \n\nThank you for everyone responses. I figured I would respond to a few reoccurring comments. I had told my roommate that she would need to move out at an earlier point, too. I had looked into my state's legality for tenants. I can ask them to leave, but if they chose not to, is when eviction begins and yes, 30 days is that allowed time here. However, the situation never escalated to eviction, as she willingly left.\n\nI did receive follow up care since leaving the ER (huge thank you to those who suggested) I'm very fortunate, I have a concussion, not nothing more serious. However the symptoms of a concussion are incredibly intrusive on my life. I wasn't trying to avoid communication with my roommates, I was not physically able to have a coherent conversation or understand much of what was being said. I had expressed this to my roommate at the beginning of and during our conversation. My head is better a couple weeks out, but I'm still struggling and have cognitive impairment. I recognize that my actions are are  not perfect, I absolutely do. Had I been in my normal mental state things would have been different. TA, I'd like to know.\n\nMy roommate is not a terrible person. She's doing the best she can. She's very mothering and kind, and goes above and beyond for her students and the people she cares for. I hope I haven't painted her as a villain, because I know she's doing her best. I've only tried to present the conflict as objectively as I can.", "created_utc": 1677676274, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f3eyw/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_leave_after_she/", "score": 1156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
