My fianc\u00e9es mom hates me because our Christian views are a bit different. We are both Baptist but I still enjoy watching scary movies, listening to non Christian music, and have gay friends. (Even though my friends and I don\u2019t agree on the same things we don\u2019t let that come in between us it\u2019s important to both stand firm on what we believe in but not push it down each other\u2019s throats). I also have a lot of guy friends (will come into play later).\n\nAnyway she doesn\u2019t agree with any of that and thinks I\u2019m not a true Christian and am going to lead her current nonbeliever son down the wrong path. I have always tried to be kind to her I never talked back or expressed my opinions too strongly. Because of this she told my fianc\u00e9 I was fake. I was just trying to have respect for her and her household. She wouldn\u2019t say anything to me but she would always stalk my Facebook, see all my guy friends comments, and tell my fianc\u00e9 that I was cheating on him/ I\u2019m hiding things. My fianc\u00e9 has full access to my phone because I don\u2019t believe in keeping secrets. He knows my friends I\u2019ve introduced them. \n\nWell after hearing all that I blocked her. She went insane. On my birthday we were hanging out and he got a call to come home \u201cright now\u201d. He left and she yelled at him for me blocking her which we both agreed was the right move to make. She messaged me and she was furious. I apologized and unblocked her but she unfriended me and told me she didn\u2019t want to be apart of me and him any longer. The whole situation was confusing. We tried to make amends with her my fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t deserve to live in the torment I caused with her.\n\nI went to her house about a month later we were laughing and having a good time making jokes. But then we were left alone. I don\u2019t even wanna repeat what all she said to me. But when my fianc\u00e9 came back I pretended everything was ok. Then I made the joke of dying my hair pink (not sure how the subject came up) that\u2019s when she said \u201cif you dye your hair pink you\u2019re not allowed to marry my son.\u201d I looked at him and said \u201cI guess we\u2019re over then\u201d. A few months later i temporarily dyed my hair bright pink with food coloring. She went ballistic! She messaged my fianc\u00e9 about how disrespectful I was and how I\u2019m mocking her and how he shouldn\u2019t be with me. It was a mess. We tried explaining that it\u2019ll fade in 2 weeks but she wasn\u2019t having it. \n\nLooking back I feel like I probably shouldn\u2019t have dyed it pink I was just so upset with her talking bad about me to him. I\u2019m not sure what I thought was going to happen when I did it. It was probably just my petty side coming out. Anyway I feel bad that my fianc\u00e9 had to live with her through all that but he doesn\u2019t blame me for any of it. Aita? Should I feel bad about what I did?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Update I should mention we did get married very recently just wanted to share this story and get opinions)", "created_utc": 1673799002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cnhoi/aita_for_dying_my_hair_pink_after_my_future/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
