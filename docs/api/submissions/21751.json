You definitely are right to put your family and kids first and go where you think the best place is for them! The ONLY thing your brother was right about is that Texas (at least Dallas and Austin) is much safer than Seattle; I've lived in all 3 places. Seattle is not bad, great job opportunities and a beautiful city, but it does have a much higher than average crime rate, so does Portland.", "NTA.

Violent crime is about 4% higher in Seattle, but property crime (armed robbery, car theft, home invasion) is over 20% higher in Seattle. Also, Seattle has had the third highest rate of LGBTQ hate crime in the US since 2012 and it is still increasing as of 2021 data.", "I'd check Sperling's for city crime data; the links show that for violent crime, Seattle and Dallas are about even, but Seattle has 50% higher property crime, and for Austin vs Settle, Austin is 50% lower property crime and about 9% lower violent crime.

Seattle loves to paint itself as LGBTQ friendly, but the crime data shows otherwise, it's the third highest hate crime city in the US.
