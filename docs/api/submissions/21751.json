You definitely are right to put your family and kids first and go where you think the best place is for them! The ONLY thing your brother was right about is that Texas (at least Dallas and Austin) is much safer than Seattle; I've lived in all 3 places. Seattle is not bad, great job opportunities and a beautiful city, but it does have a much higher than average crime rate, so does Portland.", "NTA. If he wants your family to have a caretaker, he's more than welcome to do it himself (once he's fulfilled his current legal obligations to Uncle Sam anyway) or pay for it himself.
