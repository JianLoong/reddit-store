Totally understandable and OK.", "Since this seems like a good place for it (I will gladly take all y\u2019all\u2019s downvotes), there are a couple tricks for reheating cold burgers.\n\n1) Most microwaves have an option of power %, I actually haven\u2019t seen one without it. If yours does have that option, take a microwave safe cup and fill it 1/3-1/2 full of water and nuke it until it is boiling. Then put the burger in the microwave on 10-20% power for 4-5 minutes at room temperature or 10-15 minutes if it is cold (actual duration depends on microwave power, so check it after a few minutes and change times accordingly). It will take a little bit, but the steam will prevent the bun drying out while reheating, and it should get the burger up to a suitable temperature for eating.\n\n2) Disassemble your burger into 3 parts: patties, buns, and toppings. Take out a frying pan, heat it up on low, and toss the patties into it (cheese side up). Toss the buns in the microwave for 10-15 seconds (just enough to warm them up and soften them). Once the patties have been heated up, toss them back on the buns and replace the toppings.\n\nThese methods won\u2019t make them exactly like a fresh burger, but they will be far better than just tossing them in the microwave at full power.", "NTA. I understand how you feel about \u201ccomplaining\u201d about a gift but it would have been so easy to order it in a way you BOTH could have enjoyed more. No point in fighting about it but like others have suggested, mention the oversight to him and hopefully this won\u2019t happen again.\n\nNow if you still have them in the fridge, have you tried reheating them in the oven instead of a microwave? It will be a bit more work, but since money is tight and it\u2019s this or nothing, maybe it\u2019s worth the effort? Open it up, scrape off the lettuce and condiments and set them aside, then lay out the buns and patties separately and reheat them in the oven, then scrape the lettuce and condiments back onto the reheated burger. Still not the same but maybe better than the soggy mess the microwave will make?\n\nEdit: here\u2019s a vid of someone doing it with a toaster oven https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NDV6u0BEZ0c", "Cold or reheated McDo? \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\nNTA!!", "NTA no one wants reheated Mc Donald\u2019s sensory issues or not", "NTA.\n\nYou can't \"reheat\" lettuce and have still be edible.\n\nBlech.", "Couldn\u2019t pay me to reheat a Big Mac", "NTA, big macs are just gross when they\u2019re heated up lol", "Reheat big macs is disgusting.

We probably only\nGo once a month on average, but I\u2019ll check it out", "Only reason i thought it might be was i saw a different comment chain where the person saying Opie was called on it & answered saying they use talk to text.\n\nNow some possibly like using Opie because they think it's cute or something, but there's probably one at least using talk to text too.\n\nHey, now you can be \"TIL\"! :P", "Yeah our large fry here went up to $6, almost 7, after tax and thats just ridiculius to me. If you can give them away for free daily in the app why on earth are you charging so much for them without it? \ud83d\ude34", "I guess you are as old as I am.", "It may happen sometimes, but others definitely do it on purpose", "Adding to this, I\u2019ve seen the first and third used spelled out most often when they\u2019re used as verbs- \u201cI\u2019ll be emceeing the event tonight\u201d or \u201cJosh deejayed the party last weekend\u201d. It seems weirder to write them as \u201cI am the emcee\u201d or \u201cHe was the deejay\u201d but I guess by the same principle there\u2019s no real reason why not. I haven\u2019t seen JV spelled out like that, but then sports has never really been my thing lol", "Delicious isn\u2019t a binary. You\u2019re a weird dude. You\u2019re basically saying that because caviar is delicious potato chips can\u2019t be. Because beef bourguignon is amazing then Taco Bell never hits the spot. I promise you no one who works in restaurants thinks like this. You\u2019re just a snob.", "I cook all the time too but this is literally just.....making a burger. If I wanted to do that I wouldn't have gotten fast food.", "Yuck! I guess I was projecting, because I use voice to text and it's never on purpose", "sure mate why bother actually engaging in conversation. have a nice day", "You can make a burger in under 10 minutes including prep time?  That\u2019s amazing.  You always have buns, ground meat, Tomatos, lettuce etc on hand ? That\u2019s really cool! \n\n\nPersonally, I like being able to get an extra cheese burger / whatever to eat later - like the taste of McDonald or chik fil a - and being able to reheat that in under 10 min with minimal effort is great for me.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you can\u2019t see the utility in this.  But I\u2019m dubious of your insinuation that you can make a burger from scratch in the time I can thoughtfully microwave something.", "Because this isn't \"reheating\", this is literally buying a burger, taking it apart, and then remaking the entire thing. As someone who loves cooking it takes away the ability to control portion size and seasoning, and as someone who likes the occasional takeout it eliminates the whole *point* of takeout, which is not cooking at all. It truly only works for the very specific purpose trying to cut down the cost of a meal, which OP clearly wasn't trying to do.", "I mean, you\u2019re a snob with no perspective. There is so much classism in the way you talk about food. As someone who worked in restaurants I find it kinda gross.", "you know that's not true.. if you actually read my comment that is. Because I specifically mentioned cheaper options being better. how the fuck is that classist? I'm saying McDonalds is too expensive. I only brought up more expensive versions because someone stated McDonald was scientifically the most delicious possible, which is insane.\n\ny'all are delusional, good day.", "Gotcha, no issue with enjoying that obviously. But just to prove my point: I don\u2019t get food delivery, ever - because I feel the 30-60 min of the food steaming in a bag makes it  not taste good to me. \n\nThus I think that demonstrates the effectiveness of what I suggested about prepping and reheating burgers myself.    I don\u2019t like stale tasting food either, which is why I\u2019ve perfected my own methods for reheating food I got myself", "What's to work out? He forgot, people do that. I bought my dad a cheeseburger once, despite the fact I've known him for 27 years and knew he jated cheese for about 22 of them.", "Mods - relationship advice, please remove", "I love that you communicated and resolved the issue. It should always work that way", "You either eat mcdonald in first 10 min or you can throw it right into bin.", "\"Reheated food causes sensory issues.\"\n\nWhat? I mean, I get that you don't like something reheated. Not everything reheats well. But this makes it sound like some kind of medical or serious mental health issue.", "Love your Update!  I hope you enjoyed your hot burger!", "NTA and I can't imagine ANYONE (who wasn't very drunk) would want to eat a cold big mac, EW!", "NTA who thinks anyone likes cold burgers? That\u2019s insane logic, default thinking should be no one likes a cold burger", "YTA. Grow up.", "I think you overreacted but communication is key", "Maybe he loves big macs and isn't picky about reheated burgers and those were extras for later, for him.", "NTA. Nice gesture on his part, but this shows you a hard truth about most men. They're truly completely clueless 99% of the time!", "Yea, you were being silly. Glad y\u2019all made up now work on those household finances.", "NTA. Also, it's not an Autisim thing, McDonald tastes terrible reheated.", "NAH", "> No one should ever ~~reh~~eat a Big Mac. \ud83e\udd22", "He has autism too", "I\u2019m confused remove what", "No Assholes Here - NAH.\n\nEveryone Sucks Here - ESH.", "That all sounds absolutely insufferable.", "Yeah totally. What a trash boyfriend.", "Nothing personal, but similar posts that I tried to post here were removed by mods because I was asking for a \"relationship\" advice. So its kinda like a fight with mods :D have a good one.", "The congealed grease ugh", "You\u2019re having a laugh\u2026", "I\u2019m not understanding your lingo! What do you mean?", "You're right, what you actually described is making a burger but taking away the ability to season and portion to your own liking, which is literally the whole fun of cooking. What you described is a cheap imitation of cooking.", "if you were dying  of starvation would sensory still be an issue and would you die over it? Just want to get a gage on how bad it is", "YTA you made a post over a $4 burger. Go get your own then.", "As someone who has autism, stop using it as a crutch.", "Who likes reheated burgers ?????", "NTA. Even with the edit, Im wondering wtf. If this was like a local burger place that had quality burgers, I can understand thinking that burger in the fridge is a good idea\u2026 but MCDONALDS!?!  Those are barely edible \u201cfresh\u201d. I dont have autism but would be upset about a couple mcdonald burgers in the fridge. That should just be common sense, not something to remember about someone.", "Esh. Autism or no, a cold big Mac is a weird hill to die on. And sounds like he has tried to make it up to you.", "FYI you are picky due to autism. You can't say you aren't picky and then go on to describe being picky. You are picky because you have sensory issues because you are autistic. Accept that you are picky.", "NTA\nBut as you stated, he forgot. If this happens all the time, that's another thing but if this was genuinely a mistake then don't be too harsh on him.\n\nI know for a fact some men can be absolute goldfish when it comes to remembering things, especially if they've been busy or stressed.", "NTA. I'm glad you talked it out.", "The fact that you mention sensory issues with cold food tells me everything I need to know about you. YTA.", "Something about this post feels like it's just karma gathering.", "I get this. I really do. It\u2019s that one thing all week your looking forward to. Then BOOM it\u2019s taken from you. It\u2019s almost enough to break you down and make you cry (even if it\u2019s just a Big Mac) lol. \n\nBut I will say. In all things. Try to have grace. Just like he forgot you don\u2019t like reheated food (grant or those things are grooms reheated even if you don\u2019t have autism), if he\u2019s working on just remembering things better, or was having a hard day etc. I\u2019m glad you talked and he\u2019s gonna make it up to you. That\u2019s what relationships are about!", "Lmao I read \u201cinedible\u201d as incredible and was confused \ud83d\ude02", "What an asshole getting her food. Lol", "Baked lettuce and dry bread. Delicious.", "Lmao \ud83e\udd23", "calm down, not everyone is a diva, there are people who can eat a cold burger without acting like its the worst thing in the world", "he doesnt owe her shit!", "I'm a card-carrying burger snob. I travel miles on quests for the perfect burger. I'll talk at length about burgers that I've had, good and bad. I've iterated on my own technique for homemade burgers until I get it just right.\n\nI also fucking love a McDonald's burger.", "Haha seems like you\u2019re the one making a big deal over one person\u2019s opinion, try not to get so offended when someone doesn\u2019t like eating the most unhealthy food that exists", "I stopped using the McDonald's app when someone on the other side of the US from me was able to use my account to order $50 worth of food. TWICE. Within a week of me downloading the app.", "HAHAHA LMAOOO. Be for real. Imagine breaking up over food \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "For anyone without an air fryer, the best way to reheat fries is to toss them in a dry frying pan.", "So you\u2019re claiming some sort of superiority for suffering from an addiction?? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much of a flex as you think to say your addicted to eating shitty food", "The only people claiming superiority here are the r/iamveryculinary burger snob assholes.\n\nMcDonald's have refined their products over decades to be as delicious as possible, and they've been successful with it. That's not hard to understand.", "I didn\u2019t claim reheating food in the microwave was proper cooking? Did I?\n\nI merely suggested there is a way to reheat your favorite fast food burger and it come out ok.  And it\u2019s faster than making burger from scratch when you don\u2019t have the time or ingredients. \n\nWhat is wrong with you? Why are so hostile to someone sharing how they reheat food?"]}
