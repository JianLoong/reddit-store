Totally understandable and OK.", "Since this seems like a good place for it (I will gladly take all y\u2019all\u2019s downvotes), there are a couple tricks for reheating cold burgers.\n\n1) Most microwaves have an option of power %, I actually haven\u2019t seen one without it. If yours does have that option, take a microwave safe cup and fill it 1/3-1/2 full of water and nuke it until it is boiling. Then put the burger in the microwave on 10-20% power for 4-5 minutes at room temperature or 10-15 minutes if it is cold (actual duration depends on microwave power, so check it after a few minutes and change times accordingly). It will take a little bit, but the steam will prevent the bun drying out while reheating, and it should get the burger up to a suitable temperature for eating.\n\n2) Disassemble your burger into 3 parts: patties, buns, and toppings. Take out a frying pan, heat it up on low, and toss the patties into it (cheese side up). Toss the buns in the microwave for 10-15 seconds (just enough to warm them up and soften them). Once the patties have been heated up, toss them back on the buns and replace the toppings.\n\nThese methods won\u2019t make them exactly like a fresh burger, but they will be far better than just tossing them in the microwave at full power.", "NTA. I understand how you feel about \u201ccomplaining\u201d about a gift but it would have been so easy to order it in a way you BOTH could have enjoyed more. No point in fighting about it but like others have suggested, mention the oversight to him and hopefully this won\u2019t happen again.\n\nNow if you still have them in the fridge, have you tried reheating them in the oven instead of a microwave? It will be a bit more work, but since money is tight and it\u2019s this or nothing, maybe it\u2019s worth the effort? Open it up, scrape off the lettuce and condiments and set them aside, then lay out the buns and patties separately and reheat them in the oven, then scrape the lettuce and condiments back onto the reheated burger. Still not the same but maybe better than the soggy mess the microwave will make?\n\nEdit: here\u2019s a vid of someone doing it with a toaster oven https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NDV6u0BEZ0c", "Cold or reheated McDo? \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\nNTA!!", "NTA no one wants reheated Mc Donald\u2019s sensory issues or not", "NTA.\n\nYou can't \"reheat\" lettuce and have still be edible.\n\nBlech.", "Couldn\u2019t pay me to reheat a Big Mac", "NTA, big macs are just gross when they\u2019re heated up lol", "Reheat big macs is disgusting.
