Well today I wake up and there\u2019s two cold burgers in the fridge from the place that we said we were going to get food. Now I don\u2019t like reheated food because it causes sensory issues (Which he knows about). Now if the burgers had been like a chicken sandwich or something I would\u2019ve been fine, but they were two big Macs, which I absolutely do not like reheated. I know it\u2019s a stupid thing to be upset about but I feel like he went against the plan got himself hot food and then got me leftovers. Which he wasted his money because I can\u2019t eat cold burgers. (I\u2019m not being picky it\u2019s an autism thing). So now I\u2019m sitting here upset because the thing I was looking forward to for three days is something that I can\u2019t eat.

You have every right to be disappointed that your \"dinner out\" was \" leftovers in\" - and on a limited budget,  leftovers you can't even eat. Given you are on opposite schedules, one of you is having dinner for breakfast.   He made a failed attempt at date night. If this actually makes you mad, then you might be the asshole.\n\nAs a side note, if you haven't looked into it, know there are plenty of ways to manage sensory issues and food aversions. I have several friends that had amazing improvements with food therapy to help manage their autism. As an example I suggest you look into food chaining.  You should be actively working on anything that limits your life (and on a strict budget, eating reheated food would count).", "This isn't worth getting angry about.\n\nAnnoying for you, sure.

Let him know he got you the wrong food and he probably should have remembered that, and then go out and get your own fresh from the restaurant and then move on with your life.\n\nAsk yourself: Is this minor inconvenience something worth having a long, drawn out fight over?", "NAH. While it's disappointing, it's important to remember that your fianc\u00e9 likely had good intentions.", "It\u2019s ok to be disappointed and upset about it. But it\u2019s also not a huge deal, so you probably want to keep your emotions in check as you try to communicate this disappointment to your fianc\u00e9e. That can be difficult if you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being heard. You can try saying out loud \u201cI know it\u2019s a little thing\u201d, to remind yourself and him that you still have a clear perspective, but it\u2019s also really helpful to be clear with him that this is a disappointment.", "Dude are you 13?\n\nIt's food. If you have better food (not junk food) at home eat that and be glad you're making better choices.\n\nBut unless you made it into a huge thing and got upset about it, no need for a fight at all.\n\nSo, YTA. I don't know about the autism thing here, it seems that an entire generation is autistic has anxiety and PTSD so I really can't say anything to that other than it sounds like you're being spoiled and calling it autism.\n\nIf you have no food and only the cold burgers and it really is eating that or starving and you ACTUALLY can't eat them due to a real condition (real like food allergies), Only then are you NTA.", "YTA A bit of an overreaction", "NAH.

And you\u2019re mad at him for trying to do something nice? I don\u2019t know it just seems like a whole lot of nothing and not something to be annoyed about.

NTA but your bf needs to apologize, it's just not nice. He could have just ordered himself some if he really could not wait, told you when you woke up and you'd have your share left to spend on what you wanted.

There are way harder things in everyday life that you might want to steel yourself to be prepared for.\n\nTo me this still sounds like someone who is sad because they can't have a burger.

Because people throughout history just ate what they had or starved and I don't think that a new autism pandemic is a real thing. Seems that a lot of people now define themselves as autistic or neurological divergent and I highly doubt that it's an actual thing.\n\nSo my vote remains.", "Go buy yourself some op. He can eat his cold food as leftovers. NTA", "Maybe you still have the plans tomorrow? Maybe just wait until he wakes up and ask him why he got them? Upset/mad - whatever emotion, just chill out.
