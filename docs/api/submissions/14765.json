She also said his skin was dirty. I told my other friend about this and she told me it was fine because she doesn\u2019t know our language, she probably doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s even saying. But Masha\u2019s been living in my country for a year so like.. She should know. \nI agreed until what happened next.\n\nMasha called him a monkey IN UKRAINIAN THIS TIME so she knew fully well what she saying.. And she was proud too.. She was the one who told me how to say it in her language. She was laughing too. I told my friends about this and some literally accused me of lying.. They questioned how I knew Ukrainian and I told them that SHE was the one who told me, but they didn\u2019t believe me because \u2018that\u2019s stupid, she wouldn\u2019t set herself up like that.\u2019 And some people think I\u2019m a bad person for telling others about this, and I should\u2019ve informed her that the comments she made were offensive instead of going around telling people.\n\n I mean honestly, I can see why some people think  I\u2019m the AH here but I want people to understand that she not only said racist stuff in English, but she also said it in her language.

It's not some out of date term like 'coloured' that boomers get confused by, it's a term purposely used it to be as offensive as possible.\n\nPlus I don't see anything wrong with telling your friends, it would be the same as warning your girl friends if a guy said something horribly sexist.", "NTA\n\nIdk if things are different in Ukraine, but her behaviour is unacceptable...

She also said Germany should have a better immigration policy and not let so many foreigners live here.\n\nI told her that if she ends up moving to Germany like she wants to, she will be an immigrant and a foreigner, too.\n\nShe cried and got so upset that the teachers got involved.", "There\u2019s a racist Ukrainian kid at my school he literally tried to brush my braids with a dustpan brush when we were cleaning up the food tech classroom and he called me a monkey and said my hair is ugly", "Once is an error, twice is stupidity, three times is deliberate and malicious.\n\nNow a lot of cultures can be very direct and even rude without things being racist - she might have called a pale fat boy a pig or a tall broad shouldered one a gorilla, and it would just have been about making fun of characteristics that are not related to race (and knowing people of Eastern Europe and also Northern Europe - the languages are varied, colourful and packed with insults, liberally flung in every direction.) On this background at least the first couple of comments could have been an attempt to just find something to joke around with, and if you confront her she will probably claim this is how she used it. She is still being unpleasant and malicious though, so NTA for not wanting that negative energy around.\n\nAs for telling the others - they are right, you should have let her know the particular connotations for \"monkey\" before you started talking about her as a racist.

Hopefully she'll be less racist in a couple of years with gentle guidance. It takes time to change old habits.", "ESH\n\nYour friends are right.

And at the start of the invasion last year, when Ukrainians were fleeing into Western Europe, basically white people were allowed to flee while black people had to essentially stay and hope that the queue would let them out before the Russians bombed them to death.  It was pretty horrific actually.", "The war in Ukraine has done wonders for their public relations.  Pre-Russian invasion they were basically known for racism, mail order brides, cyber crimes, and a boatload of corruption.\n\nThere's varying levels of truth to those things, but they're looked at in a much better light now.", "\"to black people\" the \"to\" slipped out of your sentence and made it very different.", "Eastern Europe in general, really. No, not everyone from there is racist, but you will find a lot more of them, percentage-wise.", "I come from Eastern Europe and I don\u2019t know people for whom this would be acceptable. I mean, many people in my country are racist, but this usually goes for people who don\u2019t bother to educate themselves about pretty much anything. Like you know, someone who doesn\u2019t even try to do well in school or learn something except from how to drink and smoke. People with a decent level of sanity and education don\u2019t say these things and the only \u201cweird\u201d thing I can partially understand is when a person from my region looks at a black person for a second longer - because in here it\u2019s not really connected to any disrespect most of the time, it\u2019s rather the interest and \u201cwhat is this person doing in our awful country, they could do better\u201d. I\u2019d say an average person has some stereotypes, because they won\u2019t probably meet any black person in their life and there isn\u2019t a lot of information to help to break them. Still, the stereotypes I\u2019m talking about are not the things mentioned in the post and they also aren\u2019t this harmful, if that makes sense? (I\u2019ve never heard anyone saying black people were unclean, stupid or that their hair was unprofessional or whatever, but I do see Americans saying these things). Parents usually don\u2019t give their children the talk about \u201cit\u2019s bad to be racist\u201d or about racism in general, but for me, this resulted in not even having a concept of racism at all. Like I couldn\u2019t comprehend its existence because no one was really giving me the idea that people can be discriminated on the basis of their skin color. I\u2019ve only realized it recently and I\u2019ve been quite happy about it, but it looks like the girl from the post could really use some lecture from her parents. And her parents too, she\u2019s probably learned this from them\u2026", "Wtf she called him a MONKEY, that's degratory in every language, she doesn't need any cultural background or language skill to know this.

But it\u2019ll make her question why her actions are wrong. And in turn maybe she educates herself on differing perspectives and become less racist.

They knew that treating an entire group of people based on their skin color was wrong. \n\nBy age 14 (especially in the digital age) there are very few people who don't know it's wrong not to treat someone different based on the color of their skin. I don't think it's OP job to teach this girl that racism is wrong.", "The digital world is also a highly segregated world. What a Ukrainian 14 year old consumes online would be vastly different from that of an American 14 year old", "Sure, but do you think thats means she's never been introduced to any content that shows racism is bad?"]}
