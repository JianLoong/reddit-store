But honestly they all sound like shitty druggies and they bullied their poor mother who was raising their kids for them. Fuck them. Your grandmother would have wanted you to have them. NTA", "NTA- They didn\u2019t appreciate her couponing then they don\u2019t get the binder.", "NTA\n\nYour AH \"family\" always made fun of grandma for doing what she **had** to do, in order to keep everyone fed.\n\nI support what you did 100%.  They clearly didn't want her coupons, as far as you could tell.  And they are absolutely being AHs for getting mad about a coupon book they not only DGAF about but actively made fun of her for using.\n\nIt's probably a control issue on their part.  I'd advise they get therapy but I'm guessing they would be completely opposed to it.", "i think the real issue here your grandmother is barely cold in the ground and already you decided whats \"yours\" and took it without consulting anybody or anything. when my grandmother died, my mom had to fight off wolves who came to the house, claiming grandma left them stuff. overall its  in bad taste and looks tacky.\n\nhowever as you pointed out, nobody else would find value in the them and mocked her for it, so id say NTA. but didnt grandma leave a will? say anything about what she wanted to leave behind?", "\n\nNTA - If it was something you appreciated and they ridiculed her for, I understand why you thought they'd toss it. She learned to be an extreme couponer in order to care for you and your cousins. You were all neglected by your parents and your grandma stood up and did what she needed to do to care for you. It's admirable. You see that and they didn't. \n\nKeep in mind they are also hurting and while they may have made fun of her in the past, maybe now that she's passed they can see how she jumped through hoops to take care of you all...in hindsight, her couponing isn't so silly to them now. If that's the case acknowledge it and try to come up with a solution. Ask what their intentions are with the book. Good luck.\n\nEdit: I was under the assumption that it was 1 binder. Seeing your comment saying it was like 12 binders is a little different. You could have easily split them up if they wanted them. You took 2 trips to your car to get them all out of her home. That does seem sneaky and underhanded. You could have at least asked if anyone else was interested or if they wanted to split them up.", "NTA\n\nDeath brings out the worst in lots of people, regardless of sobriety.  \n\nYou selected something meaningful and useful TO YOU to have. That coupon binder represents part of who she was, and how she showed her love and devotion to you.\n\nLet them stay mad, because it's NOT about the coupon book but rather the strange brew of emotions and avarice that bubbles up when we lose family.\n\nI am sorry for your loss, hang in there.", "INFO: why are they furious? Is it because they wanted the binder, or because you took something without telling anyone? I think you should have said you wanted it first before you took it, even if they made fun of you.", "ESH!! 12 binders. Poor woman isn\u2019t even cold yet and y\u2019all already fighting over property", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. \n\nTake care of yourself, ok? Because it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family will.", "NTA. Your grandma sounds like she was an absolutely awesomeness person. She raised you and knew how to get value for her money which is impressive cause couponing takes dedication and patience. I'm so sorry for your loss OP.", "INFO: some of this is a little strange. Did your grandma leave a will or was this sort of a free for all? And did you know that before you took all 12 binders?\n\nI\u2019m admittedly a little torn on what to decide. On one hand, I don\u2019t think your family deserves them. BUT I think it\u2019s kind of inappropriate that your grandma literally passed away and apparently one of your first thoughts were \u201cwhelp, these are all mine now\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You also kinda suck for making this move so quickly. It's a sucky situation, though, and I am sure the rest of the family is squirreling away stuff, too.", "NTA - Your family is.", "You keep that binder! Not only is it worth a lot of money, it is something you did with her. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, for a couple of reasons.\n\n1. They made fun of your grandma for her couponing until she cried. On Thanksgiving.\n\n2. You and your grandma were close, and she knew you respected the coupons.\n\n3. It is perfectly reasonable to have taken them in fear that they would have been trashed.\n\nIt doesn't seem unreasonable to me that you took them, even without asking. Usually I would say that you would need to at least mention that you wanted them before taking them, and that you should probably have waited more than a couple of hours after she passed. But because it was binders of coupons that nobody valued before she died, it's easy to see how if you hadn't taken them when you had the chance, they would have gone in the garbage and you wouldn't have had another chance.\n\nIf there is a will, I doubt the coupon binders are in it. That's not usually the kind of thing that gets put in a will. If it was a stamp collection or something, that would be different. But coupon binders are the kind of thing that gets dealt with when you're clearing out the house after all of the the things in the will have been distributed.", "NTA. They made fun of her about the coupons, why should they get to use them?", "NTA It sounds to me that binder would have been thrown away by these members of the family who got mad. They're the ones who made fun of your grandma. So why are they getting mad now? Keep it in memory of a grandma who loved you.", "NTA. She would've wanted you to have it", "You are NTA. First of all, you are the one who appreciated the couponing. Also coupons have a very limited shelf life. Finally, even if they got \" their share\", would they have remembered to use them before they expired. I always mean to coupon, but I forget to bring ones I cut out. I am probably the norm of casual coupon users. Your family ridicules the products bought with coupons when they can't be bothered to raise their own kids, I doubt they would remember to take the coupons with them for shopping, and by the time the finished arguing over who got what, the coupons would be expired and worthless", "Of course she needed to use all the coupons. She was raising kids that were not her own. She probably didn't get a dime from the mothers. Then, your family makes her cry mocking her couponing? Are they serious?\n\nNTA", "Info: what items did they want to buy that she had a coupon for? Coupons only work when you purchase an item. These have 1/10 of a cent value to them for the grocery store that collects them from the manufacturer. \n\nAsk them what items they are purchasing that week (except oxy and meth) and if there is a coupon available you will be more than happy to give it to them.  Look at all the expiration dates. Most only last 1 month. That is no time at all, does the family understand they don't hand out cash for these?", "Especially when they were so methed out that the lady they called white trash had to take care of their kids. Does meth eat the self awareness part of the brain first?", "exactly what i wanted to say", "Right?! As if saving money is a bad thing. Sheesh.", "Normally I'd agree with you about \"divying up the spoils\" so quickly, but on the knowledge that before grandma passed nobody was interested in the coupons, I can definitely understand how it was a \"save them now or lose them forever\" mentality, and I think that's a decent argument for grabbing them even though grandma was only just passed. Also (and I made this point in my judgment post, but I'm interested in other opinions) coupon binders are usually not something that goes in a will, they're the things left behind after the will's been executed.", "The EDIT is how I feel too. I was leaning towards N T A at first but now realizing there was 12 makes this harder.", "I guess you could say I cashed in on the coupons, but at least I didn't buy them off eBay.", "Because they think it should have been split five ways and they think I snuck it out without telling them.", "The coupons would have expired before the family was done arguing over them.", "I doubt there\u2019s a will, at least I haven\u2019t heard of one yet.", "Assuming OP is in the US, the grocery store gets the face value of the coupon plus a small handling fee.", "Yes", "Honestly, that didn't change anything for me. They bullied grandma and teased her to _tears_. They didn't appreciate her couponing so why should they get her coupons now?", "Did you though? It\u2019s not made very clear in the post", "You're absolutely sure the will isn't in the binder right?\n\nBecause they don't sound stable and if they don't find a will that (presumably false) accusation may be coming your way.", "I took them without telling anyone I was doing it, but I wasn\u2019t like hiding them or anything. It\u2019s about 12 binders of coupons so it took me two trips to my car.", "Wait what? Your post says there was one binder", "How big are these binders?", "Sorry that was a typo", "It's mercenary and poor form to start taking things from the deceased's home so soon after their passing.  Not to mention, in most jurisductions it's illegal to do so.  The law prevents relatives from removing items before probate.\n\nIt's not about your feelings/support about the coupon binder.  It's about letting the process unfold as it should.\n\nI don't blame your family.  I guess I'll be an outlier and say YTA.", "You say your family are drunks and meth users. Why do you expect them to be reasonable? Yes, if you hadn't taken the coupans they would have thrown them out. But they are mad that you will get the benefit of something they won't. Just ignore them. \n\nNTA", "YTA. You make it seem like it's nothing then say it's 12 binders in the comments. The fact that your grandma hasn't been dead for what 48 hours and y'all are acting like this is pathetic. Everyone of you need to grow up.", "You have more problems than taking her coupons", "NTA in the slightest.", "NTA they ridiculed her for using them, they don\u2019t get to claim them.", "NTA", "NTA. Meth and pill dealers take cash only.", "You're NTA for taking the coupons. You're the only one who appreciated your grandma's thriftiness and I'm sure she would want you to have them. What are you ARE the asshole for is for grabbing them right away. I mean only a few hours? It just seems kinda cold", "Ummm...people who live in a trailer and have nothing but discount coupons to their name don't generally leave wills. You can see why: \"I leave my beaten-up old trailer to my youngest grand-daughter, in the hope that she will use it wisely...\"", "So if there's no will or living trust and she lives in the US, then her belongings likely have to go through probate.\n\nYou violated the law by taking things prior to probate.  It doesn't matter if she has messed up relatives on drugs, that doesn't justify taking things within hours of her death. \n\nSetting aside the legal issue, rushing in to grab TWELVE BINDERS of coupons seems pretty transactional the day she died, no?", "Right??? The audacity to shame the woman raising their children for being thrifty and being able to acquire more food/necessities for said children. They're awful and OP's grandma deserved better.", "Not cool to do this."]}
