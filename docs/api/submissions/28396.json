It sounds like she has been projecting her insecurities onto you for a long time and it's taken you a long time to get to the point where you can wear the clothes you want without worrying about how other people might perceive you. You have every right to tell her that her comments are not helpful and that you won't tolerate them anymore. You were expressing your frustration and your brother should stay out of it.", "NTA of course, but what sucks in this situation is it sounds like she\u2019s so lost in her ways that she might not ever change, which is exhausting. If that\u2019s the case then I hope you can learn to let comments like that roll off your back, even though it\u2019s not fair.

That said, know that sometimes the best thing to do in an abusive relationship such as this is to cut the abuser off.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, here's a piece of advice. Don't feel bad about someone choosing not to talk to you, because what they are granting you is their silence. They are giving you peace and thinking it's punishment.

She cried, STFU and NEVER body shamed me again. Our relationship actually got better afterwards because she wasn't constantly body shaming me any more. \n\nI mean, an 40 something year old lady body shaming a 22 year old? WTF is that?! It's unacceptable!\n\nSome moms can be super toxic and complete haters.", "Thank you, I really appreciate this. It's so hard because she grew up in a time where being fat was the worst thing you could be and it would be all over magazines and in the media if a celebrity gained a few kilos.

And for everyone who grew up in a time when some horrible thing was normal, there was plenty of people saying its not normal."]}
