If that\u2019s the case then I hope you can learn to let comments like that roll off your back, even though it\u2019s not fair.

That said, know that sometimes the best thing to do in an abusive relationship such as this is to cut the abuser off.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, here's a piece of advice. Don't feel bad about someone choosing not to talk to you, because what they are granting you is their silence. They are giving you peace and thinking it's punishment. Your mother endlessly makes comments and now she's just not engaging, which is a better alternative.", "Your mom's the asshole. \n\nMy mom used to do that kind of stuff to me until I pointed out that compared to me, her body is busted! \n\nI went out of my way to point out ALL her physical flaws and she didn't like that I did it in front of my dad (she was just body shaming me in front of him). \n\nI pointed out her stretch marked stomach & thighs, the cheese on her legs, the rolls on her back, the flabby arms, the fat body, the dry skin on her legs, her aging face. \n\nI shamed her on absolutely everything that has to do with her body while I twirled around in my perfect 120 lb,  22 year old body and told her there was nothing wrong with me but everything wrong with her. \n\nAnd do you know what happened? She cried, STFU and NEVER body shamed me again. Our relationship actually got better afterwards because she wasn't constantly body shaming me any more. \n\nI mean, an 40 something year old lady body shaming a 22 year old? WTF is that?! It's unacceptable!\n\nSome moms can be super toxic and complete haters.", "Thank you, I really appreciate this. It's so hard because she grew up in a time where being fat was the worst thing you could be and it would be all over magazines and in the media if a celebrity gained a few kilos. It's so deeply ingrained into her and while it infuriates me, I can't help but feel sorry for her.", ">  It's so hard because she grew up in a time\n\nThis is everyone's excuse for every horrible thing in the world.  And for everyone who grew up in a time when some horrible thing was normal, there was plenty of people saying its not normal.", "NTA at all and your brother also needs to get a grip", "So so so NTA OP  \n\nFirst off, good for you for taking the steps to give yourself the love you deserve. You are amazing.\n\nSecondly, tell brother to stay in his lane, and to NEVER call you a bitch again. That was not his conversation, his experience, his pain, and he has exactly 0% say in this. You can blame your mom, because she said those things. If it is someone's fault...you can blame them. That is how it works. \n\nFinally, if they aren't talking to you, it might be worth sending a letter under her door (so it stays out of the hands of your interfering brother). In this letter, you might detail everything you remember your mom saying to you about your body growing up. Next time you see her, ask her to read the list out loud. If she won't, you can (have another copy). And then you can ask her why anyone should have to hear comments like that from their own mother. You can let her know that you love her, but you are under no obligation to love, believe or accept hurtful insults.  \n\nIt could also possibly help by slowly bringing in more body positive phrases whenever she is staying something bad about herself. As ticked as I am about what she has said to you, little kindnesses here and there can help with positive reinforcement.\n\nIf she won't change her behaviour, it is not on you. But stand firm and let her and bro know in no uncertain terms, that negative body comments are a no go. If they press the behaviour, leave immediately in the middle of the conversation until they get it. Every negative body comment: \" I have told you how I feel about this. Bye.\" Every time.\n\nAll the best and all the hugs. You are enough, and you are everything.", "NTA\n\nI completely empathise with your situation, having grown up in a very similar environment. It led to many ED with me, but now I'm ok after going NC. \n\n I feel absurdly proud of you for coming so far, getting to know and love your body, and finally drawing a line under your mother's comments and setting a boundary. Try to keep strong in the face of this....I know its difficult, but your body, your rules, end of story! If people have issues with how you deal with negativity launched against you, well thats on them I'm afraid.", "Omg NTA you are a hero. I\u2019m so sorry you were parented like \u2026 that. Thank god for you. And your equilibrium shines through your writing, too.", "NTA.

Your clothes are your business, not hers.", "Nta, but dear, i think it is time to go NC with a few people. Believe me, this is NEVER NORMAL.  You could have had severe body image issues or worse, an ED. As daughters, our first supporters are our mothers. They are NEVER supposed to discourage you from being yourself.", "You go girl!! If nothing positive is coming off her mouth!! You are setting boundaries, you are not insulting anyone, just stopped coping with her opinions and comments.\nExplore your sensuality.

Your brother should've stuck up for you or at least minded his own business.", "Friendly reminder for you to visit a doctor and check that everything is in order with your body. You don't seem to have an eating disorder, so you should have lost weight with everything your mom did (it doesn't take away from the fact that she's horrible to have done that to a kid), but your body may be having some other kind of problem.\n\nIf everything is fine at the health level, then live your life without worrying about nothi... Well, except money. Always worry about money.", "NTA + Ignore your brother. He's still a mommy's boy drinking the breast milk, and doesn't have Independent thoughts or agency yet.", ">Don't feel bad about someone choosing not to talk to you, because what they are granting you is their silence.\n\nThis is such a great way of spinning it. I needed to hear this, so thank you.", "NTA. You did the right thing and deserve to feel proud for standing up for yourself.", "How old are you? Can\u2019t you move out?\n\nYour family sounds shitty.", "Nta but your family is.", "But your mother is to blame for the hate you have felt for your body. I mean who else does your brother think it's down to?\n\nYou go out in whatever makes you feel good. But really you could do with some distance between you and your mother. \n\nNTA", "Nta you should look to move out and keep low contact. Clearly your brother didn\u2019t receive the same treatment so you don\u2019t have any support", "NTA \n\nBut your family sure are assholes.  Not talking to you? Rejoice!", "I\u2019m in my 30s and I\u2019ve never managed to state this as clearly and confidently to my mother  as you just have. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nNTA, and good for fucking you girl", "If you're not living independently you need to start making plans to do so. Once you're on your own, I'd strongly suggest limiting contact if your mother will not follow a few very basic rules: no diet talk, no commenting on anybody's body or clothes or food choices, *especially* no commenting on *your* body etc.\n\nIt can be hard to implement at first, but what works well for many people is simply walking away from the conversation as soon as the other person starts. If that means you drove an hour for a visit and then left after five minutes, well, sooner or later the problem person learns that if they want to see you they need to shape up. (Or else they don't learn, and they lose contact.)\n\nNTA.", "\"Neither of them have spoken to me yet today.\"\n\nCongratulations.\n\nNTA.", ">  It's so hard because she grew up in a time where being fat was the worst thing you could be and it would be all over magazines and in the media if a celebrity gained a few kilos\n\nYeah, and lots of people grew up in that time, but they didn't all grow up to abuse their children."]}
