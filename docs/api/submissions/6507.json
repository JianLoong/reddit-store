He was chatting with us and our 5 year old about the trip and the beach while putting the luggage in the cart. I asked my 5 year old to give him $5 and she happily compiled. The man thanked her, wished her a safe flight and to visit again soon. I did not hear any tone other than a standard thank you from the man. \n\n\n\nMy wife is absolutely furious with me - per her, it was condescending for me to have our daughter give a 'tip' to him. Essentially, I should have given the tip instead of my daughter because it would have been very very embarrassing for a 60 year old man to receive a tip from a 5 year old. It would have been better coming from me, a 40 year old. \n\n\nI tried reading the etiquette for this on Google, but have drawn blank. I am more than willing to be corrected and be called an asshole if someone can please educate me as to why I was wrong.

Your wife is making a big deal out of nothing.", "NTA- This is how you teach children to tip, and to have transactions in general. I would not see this as condescension. It was a teachable moment that the receiver of the tip likely recognized. Your 5 year old was happy to learn a grown up thing and showed they can socially do new things. That\u2019s fantastic! I think your wife might feel a certain way about economic status, but I\u2019m salaried and my husband is a tattoo artist. We have kids and all have been shown how to tip in this exact way. Good job!", "NTA. You\u2019re teaching your 5 year old a good habit of acknowledging someone\u2019s hard work and compensating them. Guaranteed that man found it adorable and made him smile. You spread kindness by teaching your child.", "NTA  As a prior waitress/person that relied on tips, I honestly never cared who handed me a tip.  I imagine the baggage guy said thank you and never thought about it again.  \n\nAnyone who takes offense should probably not work in the service industry, you need a thick skin for that.", "NTA, like at all. I'm sure the man was appreciative and you're teaching your daughter good manners.", "NTA.  My dad used to do this. You meant no harm, and it's a good way to teach young kids about how tipping is important. It's showing acknowledgment to someone's good work. Plus the guy knows its not actually the kid's money. I think your wife is overreacting.", "NTA. Your wife's perspective is bizarre, I can't really begin to wrap my head around why it would be seen as condescending. Getting your young child to carry out interactions like this is a really normal way of including them in things and I'm sooner expect the porter to find it charming than anything else.", "NTA. My first thought was \"aw that's cute\" about the kid tipping. Gotta teach them about tipping at some point.", "NTA. When I was a little kid, my mom always let me give the tips to our servers. It's not embarrassing or condescending to have a child hand someone a tip; it's money either way and it's teaching the kid to have good etiquette.", "NTA\n\nTeaching your child basic respect and how to treat others kindly is what you're *supposed* to be doing. You were not condescending, your wife's attitude is though.", "NTA your teaching your daughter independence and respect for tipping service workers. Not sure why that\u2019s condescending. Kids have to learn and practice.", "What? I honestly can't understand what on earth your wife is talking about. That's a really, really weird belief.\n\nNTA", "NTA- you were teaching your child how to show appreciation", "NTA. Seriously, if the guy is (near on) 60, odds are he's know for decades how excited kids can get about giving the tip. At worst, he doesn't care; at best, he actually liked your teaching her young and/or giving her a chance at getting excited over it.", "NTA. I can understand your wife's point but I think it depends on reading the situation. Sounds like a cute moment. It could be condescending in the wrong scenarios, but doesn't seem like you read the situation wrong. Your wife being furious seems like an intense overreaction either way", "NTA, how else is your daughter supposed to learn how to tip, and whom?", "NTA drawing a blank on this one. Not sure how on earth your wife has stretched this one in to something offensive. Seems like a good lesson to teach the kid more than anything.", "NTA - There is nothing wrong with her giving him a tip.", "NTA. In my experience, people in service jobs don't care where the tip comes from. They are typically happy as long as they get a tip and are treated with respect", "NTA. My father would have me give the tip or have me give money or an item to a homeless person or a person in need. He's gone now, but I still remember.. and I love him and miss him all the more for it.", "NTA. That sounds adorable.", "NTA. He clearly saw that the tip came from you and it can be good for a kid to learn how to do something nice for people who help her. Plus the guy was engaging with your daughter which most likely means he didn\u2019t mind her giving him the money. I don\u2019t know why your wife is freaking out, but as a mom myself, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten upset if my husband did the same.", "NTA - I did this all the time as a kids and continue to do it with my kids. Never had a bad reaction and most interactions are very positive. Teaches the kids that appreciation is needed.", "NYA. Having a kid hand the tip is cute, and absolutely isn't an insult in any way.", "NTA. I can assure you that these appreciated the tip & doesn\u2019t care whether it came from your or your daughter.", "NTA Don't understand the view that it is condescending.", "NTA If anything, you're teaching your child to be respectful to service workers and tip them for their work, how is that bad? Criticisms of tipping culture aside, I find it pretty cute!", "Receiving a tip from a 5 yo is endearing and adorable? Your wife is wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You\u2019re helping your daughter learn good tipping practices", "NTA\n\nI work for tips. Go ahead, have your cute kids tip me. That's fine. As long as they're not wiping their nose on the bills or getting them all sticky I'm fine.", "NTA - there's no way in hell the employee believes they are being looked down on in this situation. They know where the money came from and appreciate the tip regardless of who handed it to them. \n\nFirst of all, it's cute. Second of all, you're teaching your child to show appreciation and not to look down on service industry workers. There's literally no down side to doing this. \n\nDoes your wife have a habit of feeling offended for other people?", "NTA. But is this maybe a cultural thing? My dad and his family believe that only men should handle tipping and other financial matters. (I don\u2019t agree but I was raised this way). Even now I feel weird dealing with it and often ask any male party I\u2019m with to handle it for me. Just a thought.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s adorable", "NTA. Your wife is just picking on you lol", "NTA, but your wife is.", "NTA it sounds like she was respectful and is learning how to tip appropriately", "INFO: (I assume you did but want to make sure before arguing) Did you go with your daughter when she gave the tip. Like in a \"what do we say to the nice man\" kind of way?", "NTA. It\u2019s good to let kids handle money and learn how to tip and thank people, and I\u2019ll bet that guy (like a lot of people) likes children and thought it was sweet. Even if he didn\u2019t like children or think it was sweet, he still got $5 from a young customer, which is helpful to his wallet and educational for your daughter.", "I was a waitress for 13 years. I loved it when the kids would bring me my tip or the check. I also was the waitress known to put wayward children \u201cto work\u201d lol. Children that needed to move around were given silly tasks just to keep them busy and occupied so parents and I could think. Parents loved it since we were on a highway.", "NTA - this is literally how you teach children these things, and I'm sure the worker thought it was adorable", "NTA, wife has weird opinion on this.", "NTA. This is such a non issue that your wife is blowing up. 5 dollars is 5 dollars and the man already demonstrated he had no issue interacting with your child before you gave her the money for the tip.", "NTA.It was sweet, I am sure the older gentleman did appreciate it, money is money.", "NTA- tipped employees care IF you tip them and HOW MUCH. They do not care at all who the money comes from. As a former front desk manager; they mainly complain when they do not receive one.", "NTA. My kids always ask if they can leave the tip or pay the bill. You're wife is goofy lol.", "NTA. My parents did this with me & I loved it. Now tipping gives me joy. You\u2019re doing the right thing, OP.", "NAH.  If I get a tip I don\u2019t care who hands it to me. \n\nIt may be a cultural thing but he probably didn\u2019t care.", "NTA but really, $5?!", "NAH--but I can see where it could go sideways.\n\nIt's ***generally*** not considered appropriate to ask a child to tip someone, especially in a professional setting such as an airport (making sure you and your belongings get to where they need to be safely). ***There are always exceptions***, but this one was \"on the bubble\".\n\nSure, tipping is a way to show appreciation for good service, but its typically expected that adults will handle this responsibility themselves--it's possible that the baggage handler might not feel comfortable accepting a tip from a child, as it could be seen as patronizing or disrespectful (though doubtful the gentleman would feel safe in letting you know this, especially in front of a kid).\n\nIn this situation, it would be more appropriate for you, as the adult, to handle any tipping or thanking of the baggage handler yourself. This would show more respect for both the child and the baggage handler (sending your \"robot\" to give a few coins to \"the help\"), and generally be professional and appropriate.", "YTA.  I'm not trying to be mean and I know you meant no offense, but it looks VERY condescending just on the face of it.", "Yes it\u2019s disrespectful YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes we should teach our children to tip but I think that could be done by example, not by having the child do the tipping. Tipping is entirely different than you letting your child pay at a store because they are paying for the goods. With tipping you that person is in more of a \"servant\" position and it could just feel weird having a child do it.\n\nEdited a word", "Ah ok, I think the Indian dynamic would be a bit different then.\n\nIncidentally, I have some sahibs and memsahibs in the family background (roughly 1800-1900). The only Hindustani phrase that survived down the generations to my childhood was \"jaldi jaldi, kutta ka bacha.\" So it's that kind of haughty attitude that should be guarded against.", "Who would be offended, besides you", "How is it condescending, though? Kids get excited about being able to pay for things and the person receiving the payment thinks it's cute(in my many experiences anyway). Also helpful for learning to count money.", "Nobody took money from children in this scenario. The kid handed her dad's tip to the baggage handler.", "By that logic, you shouldn't tip at all then. There are many, many people out there that feel uncomfortable taking tips at all and even some who feel tipping is downright offensive in general. Sometimes, it's a personal thing, while sometimes it's cultural. Why risk offending those people? \n\nMy point is that you never really know, but is it really worth tip toeing around everyone else's feelings to the detriment of your own?", "Beside me and the OP's own spouse?  That's 2 out of maybe every hundred?  Do you want to risk offending that small population needlessly.  It's easy enough for the giver to say it's no big deal because the giver does not run the risk of being offended themselves as it relates to the example.", "Oh I grant you there is a charming \"cuteness\" to the whole affair.  That isn't the issue.  People are strange and emotional and mentally unstable creatures, and those are probably the best of us.  To think that no recipient might find it such would be an erroneous assumption.  \n\nLet's be clear, I'm not saying that every person in that situation is going to be offended and I fully acknowledge that the majority of them (maybe even an overwhelming majority or virtually all) will be fine with it.  But once again, this is not one of those situations where majority wins but you try to cater to the rare exceptions.", "Lmfao do you live in a bubble too?", "Who cares if the wife was offended. She had nothing to do with it and was being ridiculous.", "Sorry, I'd rather add happiness to the majority than worry about offending the one occasional grouch.", "No but you seem to live in the world of ignorant bliss.", "Obviously the OP cares which is why we are all having this conversation.

One would be offended by the parents in that situation which is probably why the wife was so upset.  But it's obvious you're not really picking up on any of these communications being written here.", "And what I'm getting at is that was never the point.  The situation itself risks that a recipient, if not this one, one or more of the hundreds or thousands of people that will get tipped by them may not feel the same way.  \n\nOf course the OP or OPs daughter weren't offended.  That doesn't need to be said Captain Obvious!", "You didn\u2019t deny it, so you. Keep crying, no one\u2019s buying your salty tears\n\nEdit to add: if the thought of a child giving you a tip makes you this upset and defensive you\u2019re much too soft for how shitty this world really is. Honestly. Good luck. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not missing anything just simply making fun of someone setting themselves up for it. Thanks for the laugh tho."]}
