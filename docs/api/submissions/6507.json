He was chatting with us and our 5 year old about the trip and the beach while putting the luggage in the cart. I asked my 5 year old to give him $5 and she happily compiled.

It would have been better coming from me, a 40 year old. \n\n\nI tried reading the etiquette for this on Google, but have drawn blank.

Your wife is making a big deal out of nothing.", "NTA- This is how you teach children to tip, and to have transactions in general. I would not see this as condescension. It was a teachable moment that the receiver of the tip likely recognized. Your 5 year old was happy to learn a grown up thing and showed they can socially do new things. That\u2019s fantastic! I think your wife might feel a certain way about economic status, but I\u2019m salaried and my husband is a tattoo artist. We have kids and all have been shown how to tip in this exact way. Good job!", "NTA. You\u2019re teaching your 5 year old a good habit of acknowledging someone\u2019s hard work and compensating them. Guaranteed that man found it adorable and made him smile. You spread kindness by teaching your child.", "NTA  As a prior waitress/person that relied on tips, I honestly never cared who handed me a tip.  I imagine the baggage guy said thank you and never thought about it again.  \n\nAnyone who takes offense should probably not work in the service industry, you need a thick skin for that.", "NTA, like at all. I'm sure the man was appreciative and you're teaching your daughter good manners.", "NTA.  My dad used to do this. You meant no harm, and it's a good way to teach young kids about how tipping is important. It's showing acknowledgment to someone's good work. Plus the guy knows its not actually the kid's money. I think your wife is overreacting.", "NTA. Your wife's perspective is bizarre, I can't really begin to wrap my head around why it would be seen as condescending. Getting your young child to carry out interactions like this is a really normal way of including them in things and I'm sooner expect the porter to find it charming than anything else.", "NTA. My first thought was \"aw that's cute\" about the kid tipping. Gotta teach them about tipping at some point.", "NTA. When I was a little kid, my mom always let me give the tips to our servers. It's not embarrassing or condescending to have a child hand someone a tip; it's money either way and it's teaching the kid to have good etiquette.", "NTA\n\nTeaching your child basic respect and how to treat others kindly is what you're *supposed* to be doing. You were not condescending, your wife's attitude is though.", "NTA your teaching your daughter independence and respect for tipping service workers. Not sure why that\u2019s condescending.

That's a really, really weird belief.\n\nNTA", "NTA- you were teaching your child how to show appreciation", "NTA. Seriously, if the guy is (near on) 60, odds are he's know for decades how excited kids can get about giving the tip. At worst, he doesn't care; at best, he actually liked your teaching her young and/or giving her a chance at getting excited over it.", "NTA. I can understand your wife's point but I think it depends on reading the situation. Sounds like a cute moment. It could be condescending in the wrong scenarios, but doesn't seem like you read the situation wrong. Your wife being furious seems like an intense overreaction either way", "NTA, how else is your daughter supposed to learn how to tip, and whom?", "NTA drawing a blank on this one. Not sure how on earth your wife has stretched this one in to something offensive. Seems like a good lesson to teach the kid more than anything.", "NTA - There is nothing wrong with her giving him a tip.", "NTA.

My father would have me give the tip or have me give money or an item to a homeless person or a person in need. He's gone now, but I still remember.. and I love him and miss him all the more for it.", "NTA. That sounds adorable.", "NTA. He clearly saw that the tip came from you and it can be good for a kid to learn how to do something nice for people who help her. Plus the guy was engaging with your daughter which most likely means he didn\u2019t mind her giving him the money. I don\u2019t know why your wife is freaking out, but as a mom myself, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten upset if my husband did the same.", "NTA - I did this all the time as a kids and continue to do it with my kids.

As long as they're not wiping their nose on the bills or getting them all sticky I'm fine.", "NTA - there's no way in hell the employee believes they are being looked down on in this situation. They know where the money came from and appreciate the tip regardless of who handed it to them. \n\nFirst of all, it's cute. Second of all, you're teaching your child to show appreciation and not to look down on service industry workers. There's literally no down side to doing this. \n\nDoes your wife have a habit of feeling offended for other people?", "NTA. But is this maybe a cultural thing? My dad and his family believe that only men should handle tipping and other financial matters. (I don\u2019t agree but I was raised this way). Even now I feel weird dealing with it and often ask any male party I\u2019m with to handle it for me. Just a thought.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s adorable", "NTA. Your wife is just picking on you lol", "NTA, but your wife is.", "NTA it sounds like she was respectful and is learning how to tip appropriately", "INFO: (I assume you did but want to make sure before arguing) Did you go with your daughter when she gave the tip. Like in a \"what do we say to the nice man\" kind of way?", "NTA. It\u2019s good to let kids handle money and learn how to tip and thank people, and I\u2019ll bet that guy (like a lot of people) likes children and thought it was sweet. Even if he didn\u2019t like children or think it was sweet, he still got $5 from a young customer, which is helpful to his wallet and educational for your daughter.", "I was a waitress for 13 years. I loved it when the kids would bring me my tip or the check. I also was the waitress known to put wayward children \u201cto work\u201d lol. Children that needed to move around were given silly tasks just to keep them busy and occupied so parents and I could think. Parents loved it since we were on a highway.", "NTA - this is literally how you teach children these things, and I'm sure the worker thought it was adorable", "NTA, wife has weird opinion on this.", "NTA. This is such a non issue that your wife is blowing up. 5 dollars is 5 dollars and the man already demonstrated he had no issue interacting with your child before you gave her the money for the tip.", "NTA.It was sweet, I am sure the older gentleman did appreciate it, money is money.", "NTA- tipped employees care IF you tip them and HOW MUCH. They do not care at all who the money comes from. As a former front desk manager; they mainly complain when they do not receive one.", "NTA. My kids always ask if they can leave the tip or pay the bill. You're wife is goofy lol.", "NTA. My parents did this with me & I loved it. Now tipping gives me joy. You\u2019re doing the right thing, OP.", "NAH.  If I get a tip I don\u2019t care who hands it to me. \n\nIt may be a cultural thing but he probably didn\u2019t care.", "NTA but really, $5?!", "NAH--but I can see where it could go sideways.\n\nIt's ***generally*** not considered appropriate to ask a child to tip someone, especially in a professional setting such as an airport (making sure you and your belongings get to where they need to be safely). ***There are always exceptions***, but this one was \"on the bubble\".\n\nSure, tipping is a way to show appreciation for good service, but its typically expected that adults will handle this responsibility themselves--it's possible that the baggage handler might not feel comfortable accepting a tip from a child, as it could be seen as patronizing or disrespectful (though doubtful the gentleman would feel safe in letting you know this, especially in front of a kid).\n\nIn this situation, it would be more appropriate for you, as the adult, to handle any tipping or thanking of the baggage handler yourself. This would show more respect for both the child and the baggage handler (sending your \"robot\" to give a few coins to \"the help\"), and generally be professional and appropriate.", "YTA.

In my mind, it's a great experience for everyone\n\nAnd I understand my anecdote was about me working in a store for children. It wouldn't be ideal for every kind of store. But I think having kids hand over money for kids things in a kids store is reasonable and adorable", "I think the engagement definitely takes any condescension possibility out of it, although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s condescending regardless. But if they are talking during this time, it adds a level of teaching and normalcy even, then if it was the shy kid told to approach the stranger who is talking to her parents", "Only thing worse than a boob sweat bill is an amniotic fluid bill...but it all spends the same!", "NTA. You were teaching your daughter to show appreciation for service well done. I don\u2019t understand what possible issue your wife has in this situation. As someone who worked in service I always appreciated tips from anyone and kids are cute and fun when they tip you. It\u2019s sweet, not demeaning at all!!!", "NTA. Your wife is quoting etiquette that doesn\u2019t exist. A 5 year old giving him a tip is not insulting. I\u2019m sure he was happy to receive it.", "NTA. I'm 63. I'll take the kids money and say yes ma'am.", "NTA. It probably made the porter's day. He was already engaging with your daughter and she probably felt very grown up to be the one to do the nice thing and give the tip.", "NTA. I have my 5 year old son tip people all the time. He likes it, plus he's way way cuter lol. I think people feel more comfortable accepting tips from cute kids vs. awkward adults (me) anyway. But I don't think it's rude!", "NTA it\u2019s important to teach children about tipping and appreciation of those wonderful people who provide personal services and or labor.", "NTA", "NTA that's adorable.", "Well done. NTA. Your wife is being ridiculous.", "Tf is a cloak room", "NTA. This is similar to having your kid hand over the money to a supermarket cashier or restaurant server. She learns how to do this through doing it.", "NTA, Your husband is the jerk. Why does it matter who gave the tip? Some kids are absolutely adorable (others are jerks) and other than having your kid count change at the register when other customers are waiting, I think that was a sweet thing to do.", "NTA. \nYou\u2019re teaching your child to appreciate the work of people who sometimes do jobs that are not easy but help us in daily life.", "NTA", "Your wife should STFU", "NTA I think it\u2019s the cutest thing ever when kids tip me!!", "NTA. My kids (28,21,19,17) have been the deliverers of tips since they could outstretch their arms. I waited tables for 14 years, never was I embarrassed by a kid being whom gave me my tip. That said,my kids are natural good tippers because it\u2019s always been something they e actively participated in.  My teens were the ones you wanted to wait on with their friends because they would always make sure waitstaff was properly tipped.", "As someone who currently works in the service industry, I find it bizarre and hilarious when someone like OP's wife thinks tipping is condescending. No! I like taking your money no matter who hands it to me! (But it is extra cute if it's a kiddo).", "I use to waitress I still have notes/drawings I\u2019ve gotten from customers lol and that\u2019s been almost 10 years ago! I agree NTA and it would be something I wud be gushing to my husband lol", "I worked as a cashier at a grocery store (many moons ago) and the most annoying thing was having parents have their children pay. When you have a line of at least 5 customers deep then have to put up with a little kid spending 10 minutes counting change is extremely annoying. Teach them at home.", "I get where you're coming from and would agree in your situation, but I do think that tipping and paying are two very different things. Having a child pay in line at a grocery store? Yep, pretty annoying. A child giving someone a tip? Fun for the child, and 19/20 times fun for the person receiving the tip. 29/30 times if we're factoring in the fact that the man was in his 60s.", "Absolutely. I've given money to my nieces to tip our servers. However, some parents think that their time/teaching lessons are more important than other people's time.", "Info: where were you vacationing? Is it a culture thing? I can maybe see this being disrespectful in some Asian countries?", "I don\u2019t understand your wife\u2019s POV either. I would have found it adorable. NTA", "YTA. You're teaching your kid classism . Also many commenters are saying this could be in a third world country , in those cultures respect for older people is more important than tips.", "NTA; I always thought the kid handing over the tip was super cute. They were always so earnest about their important task.", "NTA It is cute and a teachable moment. As a kid, my mum used to send me to do just \\*every\\* commission imaginable : hand over tips, ask for the bill, ask for salt, anything... I was a shy kid so I used to hate it, but I grew up to be very much not afraid to speak in public and have friendly exchanges with strangers. Kudos to you !", "NTA. You tipped 5 bucks, so no, it's not disrespectful. Disrespectful would be to tip a single dollar or a bunch of pocket change you didn't even bother to count. It really doesn't matter how you hand over money as long as it's an appropriate amount. A 5er with literal bloodstains on it is still a better than a pristine dollar.", "NTA, you're wife is very, very wrong. I didn't get tips very often from little kids when I worked pizza delivery, but I loved it every time. It was my favorite way to get a tip.", "Right?  I would see it as a very cute gesture.", "Actually I agree with you on that *specific* example. But it would have been sweet to see *OP's* child pay the tip.\n\nWatching a child have a learning time when there's a queue of half-a-dozen people waiting to pay and get on to do the rest of their tasks, or pick someone up on the way home, is definitely NOT cute.\n\nTips, or when no-one is behind you or likely to be (the shop is empty), is one thing  but using real life, in a busy situation, for a child learning opportunity is causing irritation and delays to all sorts of other people and is rude.", "INFO: Does your wife come from different culture?\n\nAs a non-US, I can see where she's coming from. Tipping itself may be considered disrespectful in some places, let alone young kid tipping.\n\nAnyways, if the recipient is ok with it, there's nothing wrong.", "YTA", "NTA - what a petty thing for your wife to get her knickers in a twist about. Does she just go around looking for reasons to be offended?", "NTA that would be adorable to see! As a kid I loved \u201cspending money\u201d or paying when out with my mom. I felt like an adult!", "Yeah, sure, that tip is now tainted....\n\nI'm sure the man from the baggage service wasn't embarrassed. I bet he thought it was cute.", "NTA. Your daughter learned a lesson, that sometimes when we help others we get rewarded, and the man probably appreciated having a young child being so polite. Also, kids are cuter", "Nta. I loved when the kids were involved when I was a delivery driver.", "NTA - the rude thing in this situation would be not to tip.", "NTA\n\nI'm sure the guy knows it was really you who tipped him. Further, most people working in tipped industries probably appreciate kids being taught how to properly tip good service. Finally, I'm sure that's far from the most degrading thing he's experienced in that position.", "Exactly! This is also why you give children money to give put in street musician\u2019s buckets and the like. It\u2019s good fun for the kids and teaches them how to tip - literally no one in their right mind is offended by this."]}
