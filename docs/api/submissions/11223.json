That was explaining to an inexperienced person with unrealistic expectations that the world doesn't perform like TV. You didn't tell her not to be a lawyer. You told her what being a lawyer is like.\n\nNow, I can't speak to how you delivered that message, so there is the possibility that there was some condescension you didn't intend, but as narrated, NTA.", "Question: If you are saying that you have a degree in Law why does your niece and sister both say you have no idea about it?", "Refusing to take advice from a person because of their gender is stupid.  \nIf you were interested in your niece's schooling, and concerned that she might have a tragically unrealistic idea of the profession, then explaining more about the day-to-day was a kindness, not condescension.  \n\n\nI'm not a doctor, I'm a nurse. If I had a young relative going on about how being a physician is like Grey's Anatomy, I would talk to them about it, without having ever BEEN a doctor, because I work closely with them, and I promise, healthcare isn't like TV.\n\nThere's a difference between discouraging someone's choices and wanting them to understand what they are choosing.\n\nThat all being said; for them both to react so aggressively might  mean that your tone or conduct weren't great. I don't know any of  you, of course, and maybe they are always reactionary, but .... It's worth taking a look at your own social skills/conduct. I wish your niece good luck!", "NTA\n\nYou were telling her the actual reality of being a lawyer and she, and your sister, reacted like little kids playing make believe. You absolutely did the right thing. Far too many young people go into law or medicine or whatever thinking that is wat different from the reality.", "Lawyer and woman here, and NTA. Also, this is not mansplaining. First, just because a man is explaining something, that does not make it mansplaining. \n\nSecond, I\u2019ve had this very conversation with undergrads looking into being a lawyer - while I referenced a different TV show, I said almost exactly what you did. I\u2019ve been licensed almost 25 years, and I can tell you without reservation that being a lawyer isn\u2019t really about arguing or doing cool, exciting shit - and I\u2019ve done both litigation and in-house corporate work. Much of it is interesting if it\u2019s what you like (yep, I\u2019m a nerd so I like it), but it\u2019s not sexy or showy.

You did nothing wrong, and you shouldn't have been yelled at for that.", "NTA.  Your sister and niece are delusional.  Both, especially the niece, were rude.  \n\nYou were not mansplaining.  You were speaking from experience and knowledge.", "NTA - your niece, as many young (and even older) people do, seems to be confusing the popular narratives of the practice of law with the actual reality of it.\n\nDreams and fancies are a wonderful thing, but they seldom constitute a sound map of reality and using them to navigate one's future will more often than not lead to rude awakenings, and the regret of having wasted long years in the pursuit of a fantasy.\n\nYour words were, all things considered, a gentler jolt to consciousness than many she would have received in other places and times.

So you know what you\u2019re talking about.", "NTA. I agree with the other comments who say it wasn't mansplaining. And in fact, it was, what I would consider, valuable information. I can't count the number of kids I've talked to who planned to pursue marketing in college because they didn't realize the distinction between marketing and advertising simply because they got their perceptions from TV and movies.

I\u2019ve been accused of mansplaining, even at work, when I\u2019m the technical expert of the topic and the female is in training, and my role is to teach and correct. If your niece wanted to have an idea in her head that this job is similar to a tv show, and your work experience says otherwise, that\u2019s a valid point.

Don't let their drama and issues become yours.", "NTA- I think that in the first place, the gender of OP and the other person don't even matter. One person had the wrong pov of a field in which the other person has experience. The one with the experience corrected the other and then it ended up in an argument. I don't think you were mansplaining at all. And if they didn't want your opinion they could have said so.", "NTA\n\nThis is called giving a young person some perspective of a career when they have an idealized idea of what it would be like.

That is insulting, intended or not", "A cautious NTA since it's hard to tell without having been there. A lot of it is phrasing, like \"Have you considered the faxct that... \" or \"I have a lawyer friend who told me...\". It also depends on the tone and length of the explanation. \n\nI lean towards NTA simply because I know several people who studied medicine for more than 5 years each before realizing it wasn't for them.

Whatever you went through when trying to decide your own career path isn't relevant to what a woman would be thinking of trying to break into a male dominated field. You likely didn't read the room and launched into a long explanation without understanding what her real goal was in taking it seriously.\n\nMansplaining is about the idea that a woman only knows what she's explicitly told you. Her not bringing up the bad parts at dinner didn't mean she didn't know any of the negatives. You treated her like she hadn't done any research and was super misinformed basically off of an offhand comment.

Did you even think to ask about her experience, or are all your notions about how little she knows just your justification for mansplaining after the fact? \n\nStorming off because you're stopped in your tracks makes this look more like you're the problem and the screaming and hysterics is just your framing.", "INFO - \n\nI'm not sure I understand \"Mansplain\" as an insult. \n\n... Is \"mansplain\" just a man explaining something?", "YTA, I'm not saying you were malicious about it, but in this type of situation where someone is sharing their hopes for the future it's wise to ask if they would like you to share your knowledge based on your experience.

Apologize for giving offense. Intentional or not, it is clear that your niece was upset, and an apology is the right thing to do.  \nand then  \n2. Offer to get her a shadow day or three with an associate of yours that is a lawyer (preferably a female one if you have access). \n\nThis is going to both repair your relationship, AND This will achieve your goal of helping your niece understand that real day-to-day of being a lawyer, and also just be a nice gesture.", "YTA. First, you're not a lawyer ergo, while you have a good idea about what some of us do, you do not have an insiders knowledge. On top of that,  it sounds like you were rather condensending when you explained things to your niece.

If she is really into litigation or prosecution, she may well end up doing a lot of what she thinks law is.", "NTA. This isn't mansplaining. If you'd given this explanation to a woman who'd been in the field ten years longer than you and had more experience under her belt, that would be mansplaining. To a girl who hasn't even fully made the decision to go into the field? That's just letting her know what she'd be in for and is what should be welcome on point advice.

It's funny that she thinks she knows more about the legal profession, but is mad at you for NOT confirming for her that it was like TV.

If she already had a degree and was in the industry you\u2019d be mansplaining as you\u2019d be insisting on explaining something to her she knows more about than you.

They likely know how the diagnostic process works, but do they have the tools to do so or the contacts to send you to a specialist if it's complicated? Likely no. Likely they spend all day drafting contacts and talking down businessfolk from increasingly hairbrained schemes, and are next to useless on divorces unless it's to rec a friend from law school.

Going piece by piece and taking what OP said as an 100% fact based recreation and then arguing semantics is the same mistake \n\nI would bet money most of the people going into those fields and dropping out because they didn't research first are men because that's one of the ways male privilege works: just doing shit and worrying about the details later if ever", "The fact that \"Mansplain\" is a buzzword without a female equivalent is misandry, imo. \n\nI just don't understand the need for buzzwords when we already have words that describe the situation.", "You\u2019re right, It wouldn\u2019t be any different if you forced your unsolicited opinion on a young person excitedly sharing their dreams about becoming an RN. In that case you too would be an AH, but hopefully you would not do that.", "Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a reason why she hasn\u2019t turned to him for advice on the subject? If you had a trusted uncle who was in the field that you were interested in pursuing, wouldn\u2019t he be one of the first people you would go to? Something tells me he is not a trusting uncle, but instead a condescending know-it-all.\nI do not believe that his motives for jumping in with unsolicited advice were altruistic or helpful.", "It\u2019s his niece, but yes **of course** \u201clet\u201d her make her own decisions and choices about her career path and schooling. If she wants his opinion she\u2019ll ask him.", "My degree is in STEM but I work in finance. For a long time, a lot of the companies I worked with were in the aerospace/defense industry and I worked closely with a lot of engineers. I can probably give someone a fairly accurate idea of what being an engineer might be like, but I would never \"step in\" unsolicited and explain \"what it's really like\" to be an engineer because I'm not an engineer, so ultimately everything I'm saying is just a guess. A more educated guess than others might make, but nevertheless just a guess. \n\nThe only way to know if my guess is or isn't right would be to ask someone who actually works in that profession, the way that you just confirmed that his guess was right. But if that's the case, then I literally add nothing to the equation, because nothing I said is worth anything until it's confirmed by someone else. \n\nSo then why am I stepping in to begin with, instead of just offering to connect them with actual engineers?", "Yeah, dream on. He is right.", "Letting someone go into a field that is ripe with burn out unprepared is not empathy. It's cruel. What you keep ignoring is the fact he was completely right.", "So you wouldn't listen to a nurses opinion on doctors? I don't think you understand OPs career at all and are assuming he has no experience in the field worth anything.", "*\"She probably prefers advice from people who actually are in the profession, not people who decided they didn't like it enough to do it\"*  \nThat is VERY fair! Perhaps a more constructive action would have been for OP to suggest she shadow an associate of his?", "Perhaps. We all weren't there. But, assuming that about a stranger isn't great. Instead of \"you're an asshole\" shouldn't we, as a collective group, be more like \"hey, it's cool if you're coming from a good place, but make sure you are reacting with respect and concern. Check your tone and motivations\"? Assuming that a person is a condescending misogynist deepens divides and educates no one....  \nEdit: I am a nurse, not because being a doctor is 'too difficult' but because being a doctor is actually a crap job, imo. OP isn't a 'failed lawyer' he's  a guy that chose not to practice in that field", "I got that vibe as well.", "No one is assuming she\u2019s an idiot, she gave an explanation on what her current idea of being a lawyer is. And OP said, hey just to clarify it\u2019s not like that. \n\n>Assuming what OP said was true\n\nYou mean what we are supposed to do, when we fail to ask for INFO?\n\n>male privilege\n\nWell, this study shows it\u2019s more females than male for med school https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/04/16/study-finds-women-dropping-out-premed-science-courses-higher-rates-men\n\nAnd no that\u2019s not how male privilege works, that\u2019s either a privilege provided to individuals by their parents, I.e not having to worry about the debt incurred. Or a decision that many individuals make knowing the full weight of said choice. We don\u2019t need to bring sexism up where it doesn\u2019t exist.", "Unsolicited opinions or advice is not my style. She was talking to him about a problem that he also experienced so it\u2019s not unsolicited, it\u2019s just the topic of conversation. You need to be real with young people who are about to embark on really expensive journeys.", "No, you should be able to voice concerns! Why is it not okay to voice a concern to a young person thinking of entering a profession?  \nAs an RN, I can tell that this is exactly why we have so many nurses leave our profession in the first 5 years. And guess what? The student loans they took out for their schooling aren't going away just because they hate the reality of the job.", "I\u2019m not doubting there\u2019s a reason, but it could be as simple as she didn\u2019t think to. I don\u2019t have enough information to judge how he\u2019s treated her in the past. So I\u2019m just going on what was posted, and I interpreted it as good intentions.", "This!!", "It wasn't an opinion it was his point of view and knowledge on the profession. Normally in a discussion people express their point if view.", "No. You need to answer the question because whatever definition you're using for the word empathy is *wildly* incorrect", "A nurse...is not a doctor. They can only comment on what they've seen doctors do, not on everything they actually do or the full training/experience. I actually currently have a nurse royally fcking up a work process because she believes she's a doctor so no, *really* not taking a nurse's opinion outside of their actual scope of expertise", "Honestly, if he'd admitted he wasn't an expert on the job in this way, there'd be no post/issue but yes, offering to try to arrange for her to speak to an actual lawyer about their work would have been helpful", "(Trust me I hold nurses in higher regard than most doctors I\u2019ve worked with.)\n>\nThe point of the sub is to cast our judgment with what little info we receive. \n>\nI\u2019ve always had a keen ability to \u201cread\u201d people and I\u2019m pretty confident I have a solid read on him. I may be wrong, but I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet so if I\u2019m wrong I\u2019m wrong. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to stop being an AH because of something I\u2019ve said. Likely he\u2019ll cling to the posts defending him and 100% disregard any negative comments towards him.", "You can't find sexism when you don't acknowledge it exists. Yes, you will find higher dropout rates of women *in all male dominated fields*. Sexism is literally *why* they're male dominated", "Don\u2019t you think that perhaps there is a reason why she has never sought him out for his advice or opinion, even though he\u2019s going to law school?", "I read it as more of a \u201cchuckle chuckle, let me set you straight, young lady\u201d\u2026 She\u2019s debating between law school and med school so she\u2019s clearly very intelligent and knows what mentors are, and probably has mentors. My take on his post is that he\u2019s thinking \u201c well, if I couldn\u2019t succeed at being a lawyer, certainly she will not be able to.\u201d", "She\u2019s never asked him for his point of you on the subject of law, which leads me to believe there is a reason for that.\nAnd I do not believe for one moment that his intentions were helpful or altruistic when he gave his unsolicited \u201cpoints of view\u201d. I think he would be incredibly jealous and insecure if she made it as a lawyer, and he was not able to.", "You need to answer this question. Which at no point did you ever say. Was he wrong about any of what he said?", "So you think OP couldn't possibly have any experience or knowledge related to the field worth sharing because he's not a lawyer?", "Maybe? Or maybe that was the first time they'd talked about it. I mean, my kids only see their uncles about 4 times a year"]}
