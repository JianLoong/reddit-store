Also, because of the classes I took in Uni, and friend circles I ran in, I know many lawyers all over the legal profession, including guys in the prosecutors office, divorce attorneys, corporate lawyers(whom I work with), and so on and so forth. \n\nRecently there was a family dinner and my niece was talking about Uni subject options for next year. I really struggled choosing between Biosciences, Psychology, Business, and Law, so I was really interested with what she was gonna choose. \n\nShe said she was struggling between doing Biosciences and then grad entry medicine, or Law. I literally struggled with the exact same issue, I didn\u2019t get the grades for undergrad medicine, btw, and neither did she, if that\u2019s relevant, idt it is tho. \n\nOne thing that I got concerned over though is how she thinks the legal profession works. She was talking about how cool it is to tackle super unique cases every day and how she would love earning massive amounts of money while doing it. \n\nShe mentioned that she basically thought it was like Suits but a bit less cinematic. This is where I stepped in and explained how the legal field really works, and basically the pros and cons of working in it. \n\nThe minute I start talking about the cons though, after the pros obviously, my sister begins glaring at me, and I basically broke the concept that lawyers work super unique, on the feet, exciting cases all the time, they typically are specialised so they deal in the same kind of case, not that that is boring btw. They mostly spend their time reading through contracts, or drafting them in the corporate field (which is what is in suits). \n\nThe amount of time they spend at trial is ridiculously short compared to how long they spend preparing for it, but also ridiculously long too, as trials can last months.\n\nBasically my niece then starts screaming at me how she knows more about the legal profession than I do and I don\u2019t know shit about law, and how I\u2019m trying to mansplain her own profession to her, even though she\u2019s never worked or met a lawyer before. \n\nI decided it was best to just leave, I no longer stay in places I\u2019m yelled at anymore. My sister called me and told me I had no right to explain something I have no idea about, and that I was a typical man trying to tear down a young girl\u2019s dream being a powerful woman in a high level profession. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677681774, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f5i1t/aita_for_mansplaning/", "score": 886, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was explaining to an inexperienced person with unrealistic expectations that the world doesn't perform like TV. You didn't tell her not to be a lawyer. You told her what being a lawyer is like.\n\nNow, I can't speak to how you delivered that message, so there is the possibility that there was some condescension you didn't intend, but as narrated, NTA.", "Question: If you are saying that you have a degree in Law why does your niece and sister both say you have no idea about it?", "Refusing to take advice from a person because of their gender is stupid.  \nIf you were interested in your niece's schooling, and concerned that she might have a tragically unrealistic idea of the profession, then explaining more about the day-to-day was a kindness, not condescension.  \n\n\nI'm not a doctor, I'm a nurse. If I had a young relative going on about how being a physician is like Grey's Anatomy, I would talk to them about it, without having ever BEEN a doctor, because I work closely with them, and I promise, healthcare isn't like TV.\n\nThere's a difference between discouraging someone's choices and wanting them to understand what they are choosing.\n\nThat all being said; for them both to react so aggressively might  mean that your tone or conduct weren't great.

So you know what you\u2019re talking about.", "NTA. I agree with the other comments who say it wasn't mansplaining. And in fact, it was, what I would consider, valuable information. I can't count the number of kids I've talked to who planned to pursue marketing in college because they didn't realize the distinction between marketing and advertising simply because they got their perceptions from TV and movies.

One person had the wrong pov of a field in which the other person has experience. The one with the experience corrected the other and then it ended up in an argument.

A lot of it is phrasing, like \"Have you considered the faxct that... \" or \"I have a lawyer friend who told me...\". It also depends on the tone and length of the explanation. \n\nI lean towards NTA simply because I know several people who studied medicine for more than 5 years each before realizing it wasn't for them.

Some of the things I was taught doing my paralegal diploma can attest to that, I love it lol", ">Now, I can't speak to how you delivered that message, so there is the possibility that there was some condescension you didn't intend, but as narrated, NTA\n\nOp isn't a lawyer, and talks a loooooot about his schooling and all these lawyers he knows.  He's not an asshole in this situation, but Id bet there was a lot of condescension or smugness going on.", "He said that lawyers are specialised and even if he wasn't a lawyer he still has worked with and been around many lawyers so he still has a better understanding than his niece anyway", "I don't think this is accurate. USA hasn't offered undergraduate law degrees (LLB) since the 70's, and in jurisdictions that still offer them, they are equivalent to a JD and offer the exact same course of study just as an undergraduate pathway. In fact, when American universities swapped to the JDs, many of them granted their previous LLB graduates a change in title to JD without any further study.\n\nDespite it's name, the JD isn't really a 'doctorate' anyway. That's why lawyers aren't given the title of Dr. Actual doctorates in law are the LLD or PhD (Law), and extremely rare. They're only really studied by academics, and provide next to no use in practice. \n\nThere are plenty of JD graduates who decide they don't want to practice as a lawyer, and plenty of institutions offering JD/MBA dual degrees. I would not be surprised if the OP has a genuine law degree.  Even if he doesn't, as a practicing lawyer myself I would say his depiction of the profession is dead accurate.", "I am a practicing lawyer and can confirm his description of the profession was dead accurate. I think it's reasonable to trust that whatever his role is, he is working closely enough with lawyers (and is a law graduate himself), to have a sound understanding of the profession. Certainly more than someone whose only connection to the profession is a fictionalised TV drama.\n\nWhether she goes into corporate law or some other area of law is entirely irrelevant - it still won't be anything like the TV show suits. In fact, corporate law and commercial litigation would be the closest to suits (but still very far off).\n\nStudying law is one of the most expensive fields someone can undertake, in both time and money, and there is a huge portion of graduates who either don't go on practice law, or leave shortly afterwards because of expectations like OP's niece.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also, she was right - every case is actually unique, even when most of the forms and process are the same you always have small differences, have to write different argumentation, adjust for specific circumstances. Of course, she probably didn't mean that, but then again, he also entirely ignored this aspect and tried to say that \"BEING LAWYER IS BORING THING, MUCH BOOKS, PROLLY NOT FOR YOU\" (entirely my interpretation).\n\nI don't think that's a good faith portrayal of the OP at all. He literally states:\n\n>I basically broke the concept that lawyers work super unique, on the feet, exciting cases all the time, they typically are specialised so they deal in the same kind of case, not that that is boring btw\n\nYour comment honestly reads like you've gone out of your way to find an issue with the OP. The advice he gave was absolutely sound - the legal profession can be rewarding and interesting if you're passionate about it. However, many people only realise that they're not passionate about the day-to-day demands of the job AFTER they've invested 6+ years of study and hundreds of thousands of dollars into studying it.", "It\u2019s when a man is condescending specifically *because* he\u2019s speaking to a woman. To the point that when shown evidence that she is more knowledgeable than he is, he will ignore, deny, or argue. \n\nSome guys go around assuming every person with a pussy is 1) dumb as hell 2) desperately wants to hear him ramble endlessly.", "Witness for the Prosecution is honestly one of my favorite movies ever. It\u2019s a black and white film, set in England. So there\u2019s some variation from the American legal system that are sometimes\u2026 tricky to wrap your head around the first time viewing it.", "I entirely agree with you on the description of the real practice, but I don't think OP framed it in the \"if you are passionate\" perspective and I think that's why the reaction against him was such. It sounds as if there was already a passion in this future student (correct me if I am wrong on the US university system, but OP description sounds as if she was describing picking a major potentially, not going to law school yet?) and OP needed to ground her.", "It really really really doesn\u2019t mean that", "I don\u2019t see how she can have any genuine passion for the profession when he views on it are so warped compared to the reality. It sounds like she\u2019s passionate about the TV show suits and got defensive when that perspective was threatened.\n\nUnder the American system, law is post graduate study but many undergraduates will frame their majors around \u2018pre law\u2019 or \u2018pre med\u2019 to better prepare themselves for the respective entrance exams and study in those fields. On the other hand, if law is not the right path for her, she might decide that her undergraduate degree should be tailored entirely differently. \n\nThe OP states that his niece was doing pre law subjects and she\u2019s clearly very set on proceeding to law school.\n\nThat\u2019s all fantastic, she should study law if she is passionate about it, but her perception of it is so out of wack that there is a good chance she will be in for a rude awakening 5 years down the road with $100k+ in student loans. Nobody should enter any profession with this much of a barrier to entry without genuinely trying to develop an understanding of the day-to-day demands and responsibilities of it. Unfortunately the legal profession is full of graduates who carried expectations like OP\u2019s niece all the way to graduation and found this out the hard way.\n\nI don\u2019t think there was any malice from the OP, and if a family member told me what the niece said, I would have similar words of warning (although not to discourage them).", "This was a family dinner with a teenager excited about their degree choices. No one was going to die.  Op didn\u2019t need to explain \u2018how the law works\u2019 or \u2018all pros and cons\u2019 - a simple it\u2019s not really like suits most of the time, how much research have you done? Would you like my thoughts?  Would have been a conversation rather than a lecture", "OP doesn't even mention she is passionate about the tv show, just says she uses is at an example \"but less cinematic\". I am so confused about all the people using \"rude awakening after 5+ years\" when the discussion is still on pre-grad level. Do students just stay in trance through their studies there? You have to write and read tons of books and papers before you can even enter, is there something I am missing where she tells her dream, blows the candles and is suddenly, without realizing, 10 years later? \n\nNot to mention that even if she got in and it wasn't what she originally thought, there is space in that profession to find something that will be important for her to work - maybe not glamorous corporate law, maybe family law, divorce, real estate, prospect, there are so many different specializations. \n\nThis was again, a family gathering where his niece started sharing (probably after someone asked) what is she looking forward in uni the next year. She hadn't decided yet. The subjects listed are so far away from each other. And OP had to bring her down to reality because... that's what he thinks is right?\n\nP.S. \"genuine\" passion for anything isn't possible until you get to know it. Lots of people are passionate about astronomy, but stay away from astrophysics. But you have to be allowed for that first interest to grow and nurture it to find if you are indeed interested to make it a profession.", "More like The Expanse", "She doesn\u2019t have to state she\u2019s passionate about it if her idea of the profession is \u2018suits but a bit less cinematic\u2019. Suits is about as accurate a depiction of the legal profession is, as Rush Hour is to police work.\n\nAs for the 5+ years of study, the reason it\u2019s a rude awakening for so many is that practicing law is very different to law school. Many students make it all the way through with expectation like OP\u2019s niece and only discover they were completely wrong once they start employment.\n\nAs for other potential jobs, that\u2019s absolutely correct. The OP is an example of that himself, but that doesn\u2019t make his advice wrong. It shows that he\u2019s speaking from experience himself. Many students find alternative law-adjacent jobs, and many others ditch the field entirely or remain stuck there hating their jobs because they\u2019re tied down by their student debt. If she decides she wants to do something law adjacent, that\u2019s perfectly fine too, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s sound logic to progress entirely through law school expecting it to be \u2018suits but less cinematic\u2019 without considering this. She would also have to sit the bar, which is another year of intense study and expenses to learn first hand that practicing law is not what she expects, is she wants a different job she can work on that immediately upon graduation. \n\nOr better yet, if she considers things soundly before starting law school, she can do so with realistic expectations on what she wants out of the profession, and even adjust her undergrad if neither of those options fit her expectations. \n\nI would say a family gathering is one of the best environments for sound and cautious career advice like this. Who can you trust for career advice, if not a family member who has graduated the same field of study and seen the profession first hand. They have no vested interest in bullshitting you, and the OP got nothing out of this except backlash."]}
