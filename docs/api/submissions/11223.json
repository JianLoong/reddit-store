That was explaining to an inexperienced person with unrealistic expectations that the world doesn't perform like TV. You didn't tell her not to be a lawyer. You told her what being a lawyer is like.\n\nNow, I can't speak to how you delivered that message, so there is the possibility that there was some condescension you didn't intend, but as narrated, NTA.", "Question: If you are saying that you have a degree in Law why does your niece and sister both say you have no idea about it?", "Refusing to take advice from a person because of their gender is stupid.  \nIf you were interested in your niece's schooling, and concerned that she might have a tragically unrealistic idea of the profession, then explaining more about the day-to-day was a kindness, not condescension.  \n\n\nI'm not a doctor, I'm a nurse. If I had a young relative going on about how being a physician is like Grey's Anatomy, I would talk to them about it, without having ever BEEN a doctor, because I work closely with them, and I promise, healthcare isn't like TV.\n\nThere's a difference between discouraging someone's choices and wanting them to understand what they are choosing.\n\nThat all being said; for them both to react so aggressively might  mean that your tone or conduct weren't great. I don't know any of  you, of course, and maybe they are always reactionary, but .... It's worth taking a look at your own social skills/conduct. I wish your niece good luck!", "NTA\n\nYou were telling her the actual reality of being a lawyer and she, and your sister, reacted like little kids playing make believe. You absolutely did the right thing. Far too many young people go into law or medicine or whatever thinking that is wat different from the reality.", "Lawyer and woman here, and NTA. Also, this is not mansplaining. First, just because a man is explaining something, that does not make it mansplaining. \n\nSecond, I\u2019ve had this very conversation with undergrads looking into being a lawyer - while I referenced a different TV show, I said almost exactly what you did. I\u2019ve been licensed almost 25 years, and I can tell you without reservation that being a lawyer isn\u2019t really about arguing or doing cool, exciting shit - and I\u2019ve done both litigation and in-house corporate work.

I can't count the number of kids I've talked to who planned to pursue marketing in college because they didn't realize the distinction between marketing and advertising simply because they got their perceptions from TV and movies.

Don't let their drama and issues become yours.", "NTA- I think that in the first place, the gender of OP and the other person don't even matter. One person had the wrong pov of a field in which the other person has experience. The one with the experience corrected the other and then it ended up in an argument. I don't think you were mansplaining at all. And if they didn't want your opinion they could have said so.", "NTA\n\nThis is called giving a young person some perspective of a career when they have an idealized idea of what it would be like.

A lot of it is phrasing, like \"Have you considered the faxct that... \" or \"I have a lawyer friend who told me...\". It also depends on the tone and length of the explanation. \n\nI lean towards NTA simply because I know several people who studied medicine for more than 5 years each before realizing it wasn't for them.

You likely didn't read the room and launched into a long explanation without understanding what her real goal was in taking it seriously.\n\nMansplaining is about the idea that a woman only knows what she's explicitly told you. Her not bringing up the bad parts at dinner didn't mean she didn't know any of the negatives. You treated her like she hadn't done any research and was super misinformed basically off of an offhand comment.

Did you even think to ask about her experience, or are all your notions about how little she knows just your justification for mansplaining after the fact? \n\nStorming off because you're stopped in your tracks makes this look more like you're the problem and the screaming and hysterics is just your framing.", "INFO - \n\nI'm not sure I understand \"Mansplain\" as an insult. \n\n...

Apologize for giving offense. Intentional or not, it is clear that your niece was upset, and an apology is the right thing to do.  \nand then  \n2. Offer to get her a shadow day or three with an associate of yours that is a lawyer (preferably a female one if you have access). \n\nThis is going to both repair your relationship, AND This will achieve your goal of helping your niece understand that real day-to-day of being a lawyer, and also just be a nice gesture.", "YTA.

If she is really into litigation or prosecution, she may well end up doing a lot of what she thinks law is.", "NTA. This isn't mansplaining. If you'd given this explanation to a woman who'd been in the field ten years longer than you and had more experience under her belt, that would be mansplaining. To a girl who hasn't even fully made the decision to go into the field? That's just letting her know what she'd be in for and is what should be welcome on point advice.

It's funny that she thinks she knows more about the legal profession, but is mad at you for NOT confirming for her that it was like TV.

If she already had a degree and was in the industry you\u2019d be mansplaining as you\u2019d be insisting on explaining something to her she knows more about than you.

They likely know how the diagnostic process works, but do they have the tools to do so or the contacts to send you to a specialist if it's complicated? Likely no. Likely they spend all day drafting contacts and talking down businessfolk from increasingly hairbrained schemes, and are next to useless on divorces unless it's to rec a friend from law school.

Some parts of the job are really cool. \n\nOn the other hand, a lot of parts suck and I regularly give people who say they want to be lawyers a lengthy spiel on why it\u2019s a terrible profession to enter unless you\u2019re 100% certain that it\u2019s what you want to do. It\u2019s physically and emotionally taxing, you\u2019re always on call if you work at a firm, mental illnesses abound in the profession, and it\u2019s honestly pretty boring on a day-to-day basis even if you genuinely love the work. An added reality is that if you\u2019re earning a high salary, you\u2019re likely at a city/big law firm and attorneys at those places may never see the inside of a courtroom unless they do pro bono because you spend most of your early years doing doc review and writing memos so partners can go to court. Not to mention the fact that the process to become a barrister in (what sounds like) the UK is absurdly long and, frankly, classist. My cousin did his pupillage in London and had to be bankrolled by his parents so he didn\u2019t starve on the pittance he was given as salary. \n\nIf you\u2019re a corporate lawyer, you definitely specialize in 1 or 2 areas and generally don\u2019t know much about anything else unless you were trained as a generalist. You rarely ever draft anything from scratch and basically update the same precedents over and over again. Every now and then, something new comes up and that can be fun to work through but lol, it\u2019s so far from being the exciting world that TV shows make it out to be. Your niece would be very sad and disappointed if she pursued a law career based on that misconception.\n\nETA: AND I FORGOT TO MENTION that the city/big firms remain incredibly sexist and non-diverse. Your niece needs to prepare for that reality, too, if she really wants to pursue this line of work because it is not easy to become a \u201cpowerful woman\u201d in that environment.", "NTA!\n\nYou were simply offering your experience and insight for consideration, and provided your niece with a pretty good overview how the legal field/profession actually is in terms of excitement. The legal world can be pretty repetitive and can definitely seem dull when compared to movies and shows.\n\nAs a woman currently working at a law firm and in her first year of law school, I have come to learn how repetitive legal stuff can be on my own accord. While I did not expect excitement or for legal stuff to be like the movies, it would have been nice to have been advised of the realities of the field beforehand. You were not mansplaining at all, and it frankly seems like that term was just thrown at you because your sister and niece didn\u2019t like you bursting her bubble. \n\nIn my opinion, \u201ctrying to tear down a young girl\u2019s dream\u201d by spitting facts and sharing actual insight is way better than said young girl pursuing an education/career solely based on a grossly inaccurate fantasy (and subsequently having a rude wake up call when the reality is not easy breezy and full of motivational musical montages)", "Ha, I love Attack Librarians.
