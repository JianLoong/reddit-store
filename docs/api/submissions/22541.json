Some people don\u2019t know that the r word has been cancelled.  Truly. My parents grew up knowing that was the polite way to say that. And now Dad slips sometimes. Some people feel it\u2019s just stupid. Some people let their hair down among friends and use obnoxious words. Some people actually use iffy words appropriately but it still upsets some people. \nCommunication and situational awareness are pretty key. I\u2019d meet with my friends and chat. No pressure and see if changing this word is doable?  Especially since your wife can\u2019t afford to pick up the habit accidentally.  However, you might find that she has some behaviors that they are tolerant of as no one is perfect. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Your wife is entitled to her own judgements of people and can choose who she hangs out with. She can NOT be the \"language police\" and force people to conform to her wishes. \n\nI mean seriously, how often does this come up? Not a word that comes up in daily conversation anyway- to be honest I had to look it up after I read the story! I never knew it was \"a thing\" that people took so seriously. Especially if the word isn't being used as a slur to them directly. Your friends may be the same- they don't agree that it is such a terrible thing to say. Certainly wasn't when I was your age...\n\nAs for you, you are an adult and can choose who you hang out with. It is not your wife's business as long as you aren't doing anything unhealthy or immoral.  She can also choose. I guess she can gently tell them that she doesn't like the word when it comes up (if it comes up) but that is all. No preaching, no lectures, no faux outrage.", "Info- have you told them the word offends her? Sad to say it gets used casually and carelessly. No excuse but they might not know where the fans are because it is so common place.", "INFO: What was the context in which they used the word? Have you told them that it upsets her and asked them to stop?", "NTA.\n\nPerhaps I'm a little biased because I'm a disabled person who has a major bugbear around the policing of the language around disability, but I wouldn't end a friendship over the use of that word. If your wife feels so strongly about it, then it's on her to use her words rather than trying to get you to cut off people you've been friends with for years.", "INFO: Has your wife told your friends how much she (reasonably) dislikes this? If so what happened? If not, why not?", "Imo ask the friends if they could tone it down if she is present. Otherwise its her issue with them. She just has to avoid them.\nIt is not up to her to decide who you can be friends with.NTA", "NTA - People are too sensitive.", "YTA. Why haven't you spoken to your friends and asked them not to use the word? If they were truly your best friends in the world, they would stop saying it in front of your wife at the very least.", "NTA. She can feel uncomfortable, and not want to hang out with those people, but she can\u2019t force you not to hang out with them. On a side note though, I can agree with your wife that the use of that word isn\u2019t very good, and should be limited, if even said at all. I cant really blame them as the word has been socially acceptable for a while, even up to 2016-2017, so it might still be hard for some people to come to terms with the fact that it isn\u2019t okay to use anymore and is a slur, but still, please try to ask them not to use that word. If not, at least make sure they don\u2019t use it in the context of hurting person with a disability.\n\nEDIT: Guys, I just wanted to add this. I think that you have to give words meaning to make them offensive. Having certain words on a pedestal over others is something I never really liked. If the slur is not being actually directed as hate speech towards a group, and is just being used in a joking manner, although it\u2019s still wrong to use it, and should be stopped immediately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that should end a friendship (unless it is brought up and your concerns are ignored, but that falls into crossing personal boundaries). Especially if OP has never brought it up as an issue before, I don\u2019t think this is something that should end a friendship.", "YTA because you haven't mentioned anything to YOUR friends. If they really are that good of friends then it shouldn't be an issue for you to bring up their word choice.\n\nI have a friend that casually mentioned she didn't like the word after I used it. OK, cool, I'm not super attached to the word and worked to get it out of my vocabulary. I was, however, attached to my friend and cared about their comfort in my presence. I wasn't offended when she told me she was uncomfortable with the way I used the word, pretty sure I said \"oh fuck, my bad, I'll work on it\" and that was it.", "ESH YTA", "NTA. are you sure it's about the r-word only? I find it a little bit extreme to cut off your friends for that while she can avoid them. I suggest you investigate things further. My coworker experienced something similar when he's wife demanded that he must cut off his friends over a crude joke, it was unreasonable, but guess what!  One of his friends made a pass at his wife and she felt he might not believe her.", "I guess it\u2019s simply as offensive as any aggressive slur and inappropriate in your wife\u2019s eyes. Especially because she works with organizations that help people with disabilities. I think she might be holding back that she might not really think they\u2019re good people based on her request. It doesn\u2019t seem to ring true if she wants you to cut ties with them over it,that seems to me like she thinks they\u2019re not good friends or good people.", "NAH \n\nhonestly if my friends used a slur like that I'd reconsider my friendship. It might pay to have a talk with your friends. Standing by while people use offensive language is not that different from saying it yourself. If you're comfortable with that, then okay, but your wife might not be.", "In my language for example the official medical term and the r-word are almost the same word (thnk noun and adjective) and the equivalent of the r-word itself is also used with other meanings, having nothing to do with mental ability. This combined with the fact that indeed it was not considered a slur until recently makes it easier to slip and use it jokingly among friends - I also do it unconsciously and try to correct myself.\nAll this to say, that it's not strange that they don't even realize that their use of the word might br wrong.", "INFO: Have she or you ever explained why she feels the word is offensive and asked them not to use it? \n\nIf so, and they continue to use it (after leeway for reminders/making new habits), your friends are assholes. Using the r word is an outdated habit that persists until someone explains why it's offensive, and then that should cause some introspection and never come out of the listener's mouths again.\n\nBut if you've never mentioned it to your friends, it's insane to just ghost them instead of giving them a chance to improve.\n\nALSO, if anyone wants to use the \"people are too sensitive\" card, do you really want to insist on using this one word when people in the group affected by it and experts who work with them find it offensive, harmful and synonymous with oppression and negative stereotypes?? Is it that hard to just call something stupid instead?", "Has anyone tried ... IDK, talking to them? Seems like a conversation could solve this instead of just cutting them off. NTA but it is a word that bothers lots of people, and you should talk to them. Also, are they using it to describe people, or situations?", "You wanting to keep your friends when your wife says they're good people with one exception makes you NTA. Especially if she's acknowledging it's a tough situation for you. \n\nMaybe a first, less nuclear option, is to ask your best friends if they'd cool it with that. If they're truly your closest friends, they'll stop using it when she's around. After that, the tone in the conversation might shift if they refuse.", "id say NTA\n\nno one is in the wrong here really shes allowed to be uncomfertable with their use of langague,\n\nin the ideal situation you man up and talk to your friends about it and ask them to tone it down if shes around. otherwise you can always decide if you want to hang out with them or not", "INFO: Why are you okay with your friends using slurs? If they're actually your friends and you feel safe around these people why didn't you tell them to knock it the fuck off the first time you heard it? \n\nYour wife is disappointed in you and trying to project that onto your friends to protect your relationship.", "NAH here except for your friends, who continue to use an offensive and inappropriate term. I\u2019m going to assume that your wife, who sounds like she has strong convictions about this, has raised the issue with them, or asked you to? If so, what was their response? If not, why not try a conversation before breaking off close friendships?", "NTA\n\nTell her not to be such an r-slur", "NAH, but compromise by talking to your friend about it. I personally thought conversational use of the word has been phased out culturally but I guess I just presumed. If your friend only used it as an expression, they are capable of shifting it into another expression.\n\nYour wife jumped the gun, but I can understand why, esp since she's been exposed to people who are probably victims of bullying and negative stigma. Cutting them off though, esp if conversation hasn't even been attempted, is too drastic at this point.", "Not a reason to demand you to cut them off. NTA \n\nShe needs to speak up. If she thinks they\u2019re nice, then give them a chance to be. Until then, she isn\u2019t being a good friend by removing that decision from them.", "INFO: has she talked to them and explained why it bothers her? A lot of people seem to just not get the r-word gets applied to basically most mentally disabled people regardless of condition and that its used to harm disabled people and in general how it does that. Many just see it as some funny thing to say.", "Exactly. You give the words your saying meaning. If you say it in a harmful manner to offend a group of people, your giving it a harmful meaning. If your using it in a joking manner, although it\u2019s still not good to use it, your giving it a playful meaning where it isn\u2019t harming anyone.", "> I mean seriously, how often does this come up? Not a word that comes up in daily conversation anyway- to be honest I had to look it up after I read the story!\n\nSome people use it as a synonym of \"stupid\" or \"a stupid person\" so it might be coming up a lot. I was in a pub recently next to a group who were apparently displeased with something about their travels and the r bombs were flying alright.", "Do you not think that personal moral and likeness should be a reason for cutting ties with people though? If your beliefs and morals don\u2019t align?", " You couldn't say it on the radio in 2003 (Black Eyed Peas) and tv shows were doing very special episodes to educate old CBS viewers 20 years ago. These 25 year olds are just assholes.", ">I cant really blame them as the word has been socially acceptable for a while, even up to 2016-2017\n\nI was talking to my dad the other day about this. There was a time when it was an valid medical term with subcategories. Not remotely recently though I think.", "Lol", "Probably because not everyone considers it to be a slur. It's one thing to direct it at people -- that's wrong of course -- but it's another thing to use it to mean \"stupid.\"  Not everyone agrees that that is problematic.", "Probably because OP doesn\u2019t particularly care.", "Yeah, especially since it\u2019s been deemed socially acceptable for so long. It only really became recognized as a slur around 2018.", "I think this is the way.  Your wife can explain how hurtful this behaviour is.  If the friends don't care, they aren't worth keeping.  If they respect her enough to listen to what she has to say, and they take it to heart and try to change, they are good friends \\*and\\* she has made a small but useful change in the world.\n\nJust withdrawing from the friend group with no explanation helps nobody.  Try to right things first.  Persuading them not to use a nasty slur should not be a big ask.\n\nProvisionally, NTA.", "Well, it doesn\u2019t seem to be something that is majorly affecting their friendship. I used to have a friend who used the f-slur, I cut him out of my life because of his use of the word, but there might be other people who aren\u2019t bothered by the use of slurs, or might just not see it as enough reason to ruin a friendship. It seems that this is the only time OP has had an issue with their friends about this. Some people just see them as words and don\u2019t hold them on a pedestal above other words. I hope that kind of explains it, because I explained this really bad lol.", "Well I mean, just in general. There was a lot of YouTubers or just people on social media in general who used the word in a joking manner thinking it was a funny and appropriate word to use. Hell, there\u2019s even videos of Mr. Beast using the word lol. The overall point I\u2019m basically trying to get across though is that people didn\u2019t actually identify this word as a slur until recent years.", "It's been registered as hate speech since Rosa's Law was signed in 2010. It's a slur.", "yikes. The wife is realizing she married someone with no values and needs to put it on the friends and ban them from their lives so she doesn't have to look at the guy she married.", "It\u2019s always been a slur. It\u2019s only been in more recent years that people with disabilities have started to be considered a bit more respectfully and people have started pushing back on it.", "You're kidding, right? It's been considered a slur by reasonable people for at least twenty years.", "Sorry, but language doesn't work that way. Removing a term from official documents, or classifying terms as hate speech in certain context does not mean that speakers of the language agree with those assessments. Meaning is much more \"bottom up\" and is defined by language communities, not government agencies.", "That is a pretty harsh judgement over just one word. And one that, if the writers here are any indication, is not universally accepted as vile.  I wouldn't say it myself but if others do, especially in a joking or self deprecating way, what of it? Doesn't hurt anyone. Not as if they are going up to mentally disabled people and shouting it in their faces, is it?", "Can't people just not care about stuff anymore? You don't seem to care about the hundreds of kids who had to mine with their bare hands to get the lithium your using in you phone/computer rn. Nor do you seem to care about the innocent animals that died in order for you to have a meal today. There is always a line for a moral compass, and the line is situated differently for everyone, equating someone to a immortal husk just because their line isn't EXACTLY where yours is is just crazy. Finding someone with morals that perfectly parallels your is like finding a needle in a haystack and is just unreasonable", ">yikes. The wife is realizing she married someone with no values and needs to put it on the friends and ban them from their lives so she doesn't have to look at the guy she married.\n\nTypical AITA exaggeration and hysteria.\n\nUnless you're joking, in which case good one.", "do we need to bring back the Hilary Duff \"that's so gay\" PSA? It's not just the obvious, that it's unambiguously wrong to use slurs, it's also punching down- which is something only assholes do. QED", "It's not punching down if it isn't directed at a person who actually IS, whatever the slur implies. If you start banning people from your life because they use a single word that makes you unhappy then you will be living a very solitary existence!\n\nThe world is becoming the playground of humorless scolds...", "\ud83d\ude02 I found it and can't resist. sorry. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8fiwbR96j0"]}
