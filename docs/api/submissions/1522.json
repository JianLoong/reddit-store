On the days she wasn\u2019t taking care of them she took care of my mom. Brother #1 died unexpectedly and now my wife takes care of her parents all day and my wheelchair ridden mom at night. We still have kids at home and after my mom goes to bed my wife stays up doing laundry and cleaning our home.\n\nA week ago our daughter found Sarah she had passed out. The drs said her blood sugar was too low. I think it\u2019s from exhaustion. I asked our extended families to help out more.\n\nWell this weekend her niece volunteered to take my In-laws. My sister is in town visiting and wanted to have my mom stay with her. Giving Sarah the weekend off in a very long time. I told Sarah I wanted her to not worry about anything except resting. \n\nMy wife\u2019s brother #2 called and worked up my mother in-law. He has some addictions and mixed some drugs and ended up in the hospital.

Taking care of one parent (or one set of parents) on top of managing her own household and raising your six(!) kids is too much. Taking care of parents on both sides is waaaay too much.

She can be \"selfish\" and take care of herself, or she can be \"altruistic\" and take care of herself so that she'll live long enough and be healthy enough to continue some level of caretaking for these family members. It doesn't matter whether she chooses to be selfish or altruistic; either approach requires that she step back and offload some of that burden. Because if she continues on the same path, she's going to be dead.", "NTA, your wife is also having health issues and she needs to take care of her health.

For being insensitive to your WIFE. And so are your siblings and older kids. Your wife is wearing herself out pulling double triple and quadruple duty taking care of her parents and your mother then staying up to do the housework?

Maybe its time for your mom and the inlaws to settle into a nursing home. And of those kids in the home and you why the heck is your wife staying up to do the laundry and housework. You guys all live there too and unless the kids are infants even the youngest of kids can have supervised age appropriate responsibilities.

Ye gods, man. \n\nFrom your comments it appears you are both destroying yourselves simply because you have no ability to say no. None of these people sound like they would be particularly upset if you *did* end up in early graves thanks to them, so it's up to you to grow spines ASAP.", "NTA. And good for u! Someone needed to recognize her working too hard and sticking up for her. Your wife sounds like a people pleaser and does anything  not to rock the boat. As admirable as it is it literally is driving her to get sick. Taking care of inlaws is 1 thing, but a chauffeur for 12hr trips is nuts. You and her need to sit down and come up with a reasonable schedule.

Your wife is exhausted she needs a break and you didn't say anything bad.

Shame on you.", "Soft YTA. You should have found some way to accomodate her, like driving yourself, if you are concerned about her health. \n\nAlso, has she been diagnosed with anything? Low blood sugar is most often related to diabetes, not \"exhaustion\" and it can actually be deadly if left untreated. So if that is actually what caused her to faint, she need to be getting checked out properly ASAP. She may require medication and a proper eating plan, to manage her blood sugar levels, and she will definitely need to be monitoring them closely.", "No your not, you are thinking about your wife and other road users", "This has to be fake.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She has always thought that when they got old, her parents would always be here responsibility. It will be hard to change this thinking. So I suggest a slightly different approach. When her parents pass away, she will feel guilty if she didn\u2019t spend enough time with them - not just taking care of them.  Can you hire someone to help clean the houses and/or do meals. This is usually cheaper than home health care workers. That way she can focus more on talking with them, recording their voices, takes photos etc. She can build more memories of the time she spent with them. Extend this help to also clean your house, and hire drivers to that all of them to their doctors appointments. Depending on where you live, meals and drivers are either free or low cost. Your siblings should help pay for this. Ask them each for funds so that you can hire the help to take care of your parents. Lastly any change you can get her parents to live with you ?

When she got to a point where she could no longer bathe herself, her Dr prescribed \"home health care,\" to come to the house twice a week to bathe her, evaluate blood pressure, help change her sheets, etc. When I felt overwhelmed, I talked to her kids/grandkids, and they would make the effort to come stay with her so that I could spend more time with my 2 year old, go for a walk, or take a nap. Elder care is hard. It should never fall to one person. Tap into your resources and create a way to divide the care between siblings. Talk to their Dr's about in home health care options.
