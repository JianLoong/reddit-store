On the days she wasn\u2019t taking care of them she took care of my mom. Brother #1 died unexpectedly and now my wife takes care of her parents all day and my wheelchair ridden mom at night. We still have kids at home and after my mom goes to bed my wife stays up doing laundry and cleaning our home.\n\nA week ago our daughter found Sarah she had passed out. The drs said her blood sugar was too low. I think it\u2019s from exhaustion. I asked our extended families to help out more.\n\nWell this weekend her niece volunteered to take my In-laws. My sister is in town visiting and wanted to have my mom stay with her. Giving Sarah the weekend off in a very long time. I told Sarah I wanted her to not worry about anything except resting. \n\nMy wife\u2019s brother #2 called and worked up my mother in-law. He has some addictions and mixed some drugs and ended up in the hospital. He is supposed to be released tomorrow but, wants my wife to drive my in-laws 12 hrs to visit him.\n\nI told my wife it was her choice but, I didn\u2019t want her to travel especially after passing out a week ago.

Taking care of one parent (or one set of parents) on top of managing her own household and raising your six(!) kids is too much. Taking care of parents on both sides is waaaay too much.

She can be \"selfish\" and take care of herself, or she can be \"altruistic\" and take care of herself so that she'll live long enough and be healthy enough to continue some level of caretaking for these family members. It doesn't matter whether she chooses to be selfish or altruistic; either approach requires that she step back and offload some of that burden.

Ye gods, man. \n\nFrom your comments it appears you are both destroying yourselves simply because you have no ability to say no. None of these people sound like they would be particularly upset if you *did* end up in early graves thanks to them, so it's up to you to grow spines ASAP.", "NTA. And good for u! Someone needed to recognize her working too hard and sticking up for her. Your wife sounds like a people pleaser and does anything  not to rock the boat. As admirable as it is it literally is driving her to get sick. Taking care of inlaws is 1 thing, but a chauffeur for 12hr trips is nuts. You and her need to sit down and come up with a reasonable schedule.

Your wife is exhausted she needs a break and you didn't say anything bad.

Shame on you.", "Soft YTA. You should have found some way to accomodate her, like driving yourself, if you are concerned about her health. \n\nAlso, has she been diagnosed with anything? Low blood sugar is most often related to diabetes, not \"exhaustion\" and it can actually be deadly if left untreated. So if that is actually what caused her to faint, she need to be getting checked out properly ASAP. She may require medication and a proper eating plan, to manage her blood sugar levels, and she will definitely need to be monitoring them closely.", "No your not, you are thinking about your wife and other road users", "This has to be fake.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She has always thought that when they got old, her parents would always be here responsibility. It will be hard to change this thinking. So I suggest a slightly different approach. When her parents pass away, she will feel guilty if she didn\u2019t spend enough time with them - not just taking care of them.  Can you hire someone to help clean the houses and/or do meals. This is usually cheaper than home health care workers. That way she can focus more on talking with them, recording their voices, takes photos etc. She can build more memories of the time she spent with them. Extend this help to also clean your house, and hire drivers to that all of them to their doctors appointments. Depending on where you live, meals and drivers are either free or low cost. Your siblings should help pay for this. Ask them each for funds so that you can hire the help to take care of your parents. Lastly any change you can get her parents to live with you ?

You would have time to help your wife maintain the house and do regular chores, and the workload would become balanced between the two of you so that you could both relax enough on a regular basis to not die early from heart attacks. \n\nIf you can't find a way to draw a line in the sand for your own sanity, do it to protect your own children from having to deal with the effects of parents in poor health or early death. You also really owe it to your daughter to find a way for her to begin her own life and not in service of a relative (at the expense of her own future!).", "Info: you mentioned you have 7 siblings so what all of your mother's debt and her healthcare depends on you?", "OP must feel like she should do less for *her* parents, while his wheelchair bound mother lives with them and is a constant... and I hate to say it... burden on his wife. I work in direct care; give me 10 clients who can ambulate, over one wheelchair bound person, when I'm alone. And let's be real, his wife is alone.", "I literally had this convo with my boyfriend, as I AM a certified caregiver. He has mentioned his mom might need to move with us eventually, and I laid it down to him: every trip to the toilet, every transfer from bed to chair to toilet to chair to shower chair to breakfast table to couch to wheelchair to toilet... was on him and him alone. I told him in no uncertain terms, would I care for people all day at work and then do it free for the rest of the 24 hours; he either provides the care himself, or hires an aid, because *I refuse*. He has no issues with that, btw.", "He said he was going to take her out to dinner to give her a break. /s So relaxing to have to get dressed up, go out in public when you can't even stay conscious. OP is clueless.", "don\u2019t forget *his* parents! she\u2019s shouldering all the care for his elderly mother solo (despite having seven siblings) and it\u2019s only when it\u2019s something for *her* family does he put his foot down.\n\nOP, YTA. You\u2019ve been abusing her kindheartedness for years, and so has your family.", "No, you don\u2019t \u2018plan on having a meeting over it\u2019. \n\nYou ring them and tell them that your wife will no longer be looking after yours and THEIR mother so they need to work it out between them\u2026from now. Then hang up.", "\"Your siblings  were worried about to many people taking care of my mom\" what they  actually meant is they  didn't want to give up their time to help and left it all on your wife's shoulders and that should never be allowed, what did your siblings actually contribute physically and financially to looking after their mom and why was it decided your wife a non blood relative would look after their mom? Do they combine financially to pay your wife?", "Don't lie, you all were relieved you didn't have to do anything for your mother, and left all the work happily to your wife. You're all treating her as if she was a slave, working 24/7 taking care of the house, the kids, your mother and her parents. Specially seeing as you didn't even care about her load until she was literally passed out on the floor.", "Nit one family to take on! Your WIFE to take on ALONE. Tf is she doing your laundry and cleaning for? Does she ever get to sleep if she doesn't literally drop from exhaustion? What exactly are you doing besides working?", "God you\u2019re selfish.", "What are your 7 siblings doing, why are they not helping in looking after  their mother? Why are they not helping in paying off her bills? Why have her medical bills fallen on you and your wife ? Why has their mothers care fallen on only your wife? Why are your seven siblings not contributing to the care financially and physically and not helping to pay off their mothers debt and medical bills? Your siblings are AHs and they need to do their fair share and also contribute to helping pay your child and wife a fair wage for looking after their mother. Your siblings are actually horrible and vile to leave everything to your family and they should be ashamed of themselves.", "The kids are probably in their 20s or late teens if they have been married 27 years", "As a former caregiver I have to agree. All the worst injuries I saw (that weren't from attacks) were because of dealing with a wheelchair-bound client. Even moving someone with equipment can be dangerous, and you can get seriously hurt. I'm even in one part-time now and am just grateful I can transfer myself still!", "This is the perfect conversation to have.  I personally would not consent to live with an aging relative who might need a lot of care.  Even if he says he will do it all, there will come a time when he cannot due to his own illness, disability, or other time conflicts.  I read this article recently which you can find if you do an internet search:  \"70% of All Caregivers Over the Age of 70 Die First.\"", "Please, just explain to me why you think one dinner is showing appreciation for the mental, physical and financial toll your wife faces caring for TEN PEOPLE every day? Hire someone to help your parents, health insurance usually pays for that (why isn\u2019t your wife? I agree with someone above who said let her rest and you step up care for 10 people and do household chores for one day. Wait, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d willingly sign up for that stress even for 24 hrs.", "Yeah my boyfriend tells me to relax all the time and probably does what you do... let all the work pile up so there's double to triple when the \"relaxing\" is over. You really suck OP.", "How and when do you help her?", "Seriously get your wife help before she literally dies while taking care of everyone else. You have seven siblings. Time to tell them to step up and take your mom. As for her parents, time to consider a nursing home. Your poor wife. As a caregiver, my heart goes out to her.", "Your fil needs assessed for dementia. This will only get worse. It sounds exactly like my Nana when she had a stroke earlier this year which either caused or rapidly accelerated her dementia and she passed away 4 months later.", "They all need to go to a nursing home. YTA for not insisting on this, or for not looking into carers who can come and support at home so your wife doesn't need to do everything. Seriously.", "My sister and her husband are in this predicament with his mother. He has 4 other siblings and not one of them will help my BIL is on Disability himself and my sister is in the process of getting it, yet they are stuck taking care of his mother. My BIL helps so it\u2019s not all on my sister\u2019s shoulders. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t force others to take responsibility for their elderly parents. That sucks big time for people lime OP and his wife!", "They are most likely paying her bills so the mother has access to care. Everyone has the right to treatment in certain situations but primary care doctors and specialists will fire patients for non-payment. It's very difficult to manage chronic conditions through emergency/urgent care.", "If she's still getting medical care at an office, and has a balance, they can deny seeing her. They will refer her to the ER, so they're legally not denying care, but no office is required to put themselves in debt for a patient.", "I don't know if you're being sarcastic, but a lot of people feel like caregivers should be open to doing the work for free out of ***love***. Love has not healed the herniated disk in my back from 2009 when I caught a client from falling; love has not healed my degenerative arthritis (that makes my job more difficult each day); love does not give us our time back, time that belongs to ***us***.", "I know how you feel, my husband had similar problems with his 3 sisters when it came to his mothers care. When we eventually got them to commit to days of looking after her they would ring him with problems, like she wouldn't eat for them  and he'd have to run out to the house and then they'd leave . None of his sister's had families and all lived closer, one lived in their mothers house and yet he was expected to work, go straight there and come home exhausted and for that year he spent hardly anytime with our son's. The day she went into a nursing home was the last time they saw her until her funeral 3 yrs later, they wailed and sobbed the loudest there, I so wanted to ask them was it the guilt of neglecting their mother", "Good lord, no, NOT sarcastic.  If you look at what I posted here and another recent AITA, I'm totally in support of people setting limits.  I will expand my answer to clarify.", "But do you care enough to fix it? I work as a caregiver, wheelchair bound patients are THE MOST physically demanding. Your mom needs to be in a rest home, not breaking your wife's back while you sit by and watch.", "Please tell me your wife isn't the one cooking Thanksgiving dinner since it seems like something you and your lazy siblings would expect her to do.\n\nYTA by the way and so are your siblings.", "Too bad you didn\u2019t. My mom\u2019s boyfriend took care of my mom right down to feeding her when she couldn\u2019t. I had a disagreement once with him unfortunately in front of one of her sisters. At her funeral the sister apparently snidely told her other siblings he had no right to be upset because of this one disagreement. I didn\u2019t find out until after they were all back home. My mom\u2019s siblings didn\u2019t come to see her except the oldest one and that wasn\u2019t until the last few years she was alive. None of them assholes should have even been told where her funeral was!", "He doesn\u2019t answer anywhere in these comments why the 7 siblings aren\u2019t helping physical or financially. He works 2 jobs to \u201ccover the expenses\u201d when he could divide all this weight by having his siblings step up and contribute. Wild guess though, they\u2019ll all come running for money when they pass. The only person here who should be recognized in caring for them in their late years, loving them and making memories is the damn wife. OP is ridiculous.", "Some of these children have to be grown or at least old enough to do their own laundry. This is a very selfish family all around from his siblings to his kids."]}
