It has 103 people on it.\n\nMy BIL & SIL are expecting their first child in June. They planned this and are ecstatic, as are the rest of us. Typically, the culture they come from doesn't celebrate a baby until after it's born because of deeply rooted superstitions that are hundreds, if not thousands, of years old. The new parents are not religious at all but have integrated many aspects of the cultural part of this community into their life. My husband and I, as well as some of their friends, asked about a baby shower earlier on in the pregnancy. BIL & SIL talked about it for a week and then decided they'd like one.\n\nI am not from their culture and have hosted 5 baby showers, as well as attended a dozen-ish. Given my experience and close relationship with the couple, I offered to plan/host the shower jointly with my MIL (who never had one, re: the superstitions mentioned), with planning help from my SIL's BFF.\n\nEverything has been going well so far, with my MIL offering to have it at her home (I live several states away) so I asked MIL a couple of days ago what her capacity limit would be and she said 20. My SIL has been, understandably, asking questions about the guest list, and I told her anywhere from 15-30 was typical but that we shouldn't go much above that. Her BFF suggested sending the list and then marking who was actually likely to come. I'm starting to wonder if this was good advice because when she sent over the list it had 64 rows which would total 103 guests. She had marked that she thought 36 would come and highlighted several in a particular color and counted them as \"0\". I asked her if we were to interpret this as not sending them invites but she says \"no, send them invitations, they won't come\".\n\nTwo things are bothering me about this:\n\nWhy would you invite people you know won't come?\nIf it's to get gifts from the registry, I get it, but I know there are other ways of getting the word out that wouldn't risk making us hosts have to try and plan for anywhere between 30 to 100 people, which I always assumed we'd pay for. It's a drastically different plan and cost for 30 people than say, 60 or 75.\n\nI'm also related to a lot of these people and I'd be surprised if at least 20 of the ones she marked as won't come, don't. We all have big families and they love an excuse to get together.\n\nI told her this list is too big. She went silent on me.\n\nI haven't been called an AH but I feel like one. I was one of the people that suggested a shower to them in the first place. I knew she didn't know much about the norms of them given their circle.\n\nAt the same time, I don't want to host a baby shower that could swing by 25/50 people. I want her to have a great shower but I kinda feel like she's taking advantage here. I don't know....

Like sometimes people have a shower at work with their work friends. And a shower with just family. \n\nMaybe this should be a shower with just one side of the family (no friends) and that will help get the numbers below 20? And then after the baby is born she can have the type of shower that is traditional in her culture and invite everyone else (to her own house!)", "NTA\n\nInviting 100 people with the assumption that almost 40% will not come is completely unreasonable and too big a risk to take. I would consider approaching her in a way that doesn\u2019t completely reject her list but instead maybe puts things into perspective for her. \n\nSomething like \u201cSIL, i talked to MIL and she definitely can\u2019t accommodate that many people in her house. I want you to be surrounded by all of the people that you love but I think we should look into other arrangements. Do you have any close friends with a venue that would be able to accommodate a shower of this size? It would be really helpful if we didn\u2019t have to pay full price for a venue since feeding 100 people will definitely eat up the original budget\u201d \n\nThis might get her thinking a bit about how unreasonable her request is. Best of luck OP but definitely NTA", "NTA you are just realistic about the logistic. Inviting 50 people and expect 30 is ok. Inviting over 100 and expect 30 it is not. There is a high risk more then you can host will come and then the party is ruin for everybody. If, like you said she is worry about the registry try also to look into it. By experience first child tent to have unrealistic and useless items in the registry.", "Tell her to limit it to 25 people or you will no longer help.  Don't get caught up in this.  YOU will be blamed for the shitty logistics.\n\nNTA to back out at this  point.", "I would tell her that you'll send invitations to the 36 people she thinks will come (I've never ever hosted an event where 100% of invitees were able to make it) and depending on the RSVP rate you may invite additional guests, with her input. If she's worried about offending anyone, suggest to her that she host a sip n' see and invite those people to a cocktail party to meet the baby when they're born, since it sounds like that would be more aligned with her culture's expectations anyway.", "NTA\n\nYeah, baby showers are supposed to be for family and close friends, not one's entire social circle and extended relatives. If you are willing to plan a party for 30, you should invite 30, perhaps a few more as there will always be some people who can't make it, but certainly not 103.", "NTA. You're correct. Inviting 100 people and assuming only 30 would come going would end in disaster. The host taking the brunt of it. You are either going to have not enough space, not enough food and drinks or too much, not including the potential waste of money. If you have a capacity of 20, inviting 30 is the max. Period.", "I know the community and culture you're speaking of, and I totally get it with the they all get together aspect.  If any of those people on that list are actively participating in that community, chances are they won't come because of the superstitions. \n\nI'm going to guess she put over 100 people down because she wants the gifts. There would be no other reason to invite that many people knowing most won't show up. I think you, your mother in law, and the best friend need to sit down with her and explain that she can not invite that many people. \n\nThat the 3 of you do not mind hosting 30 people, but if she chooses to want to have another baby shower where everybody's invited, she can host it herself. \n\nI don't even know 100 people that I like well enough to invite to anything, even if it was just for a gift.\n\nNTA... But you do need to talk to her sooner rather than later.", "NTA\n\nEven if you take all the cultural traditions and customs out of this -- if someone if hosting a party on your behalf for any reason, you should have the common courtesy to adhere to their wishes.\n\nIf she was like \"I'm having a really hard time getting it under 40\" then maybe you could understand and try to work with her... But inflating your guest list by 100% to receive extra gifts is over the top materialistic, selfish and completely lacking in grace.", "NTA. It sounds like a gift grab to me. People who aren't invited but would still like to give a gift will ask for the registry details. In a smaller space, it's too much of a risk to invite an extra 70 people.  What if half of those people show up? Now, you have 35 people in a space more suitable for 20. I'd suggest that she send a baby announcement after the baby is born, which is still maybe a little gift grabby since some will probably wonder why they weren't invited to the baby shower, but I think baby announcements are pretty normal.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants 103 people at a party then she should have it at her own house. She was informed very clearly of the capacity limit and then proceeded to almost QUADRUPLE that limit. That is beyond unreasonable. \n\nStand your ground on this or simply dont invite the people she does not believe will come.", "**NTA** \\- You are throwing the party as a gift.  You are entitled to set a limit on the number of guests.  If that won't work for SIL, then cancel the party.", "NTA.  When planning parties, the assumption you should start with is that **everyone you invite will show up.**  Realistically, that won't happen, but it *might*, and even for someone who previously told you they couldn't make it...plans can change and the day might suddenly become available to them.\n\nIf your limit is 20, you could *maybe* get away with inviting 25, but certainly not 100.  That would be like an airline selling 1200 tickets for a flight when the plane only has 250 seats.", "NTA. \n\nIf she wants a big shower she can host a big one. Rent an event space, pay a restaurant to host for her etc. \n\nJust tell her to give you a list of 20 for invites.", "NTA - that's a crazy number of guests! I'm guessing she hasn't been to many baby showers. You might want to explain to her that these are generally very interactive -- you all play games together, watch the mother-to-be open gifts, etc. -- and that would be nearly impossible with such a large group. You can also remind her that she can have more than one shower. Offer to host a shower for 20 of your relatives, and then suggest that another friend of hers might want to host an event for her local friends.", "  My niece decided to have a wedding 1800 miles away from her home; partly because it would be warmer there, but also because FEWER people would come. (Yes, she shared this)\n\nI'll just condense her story and say that she had a HUGE list of invitees for her wedding, and felt she should invite them all. So she planned her wedding nearly 2000 miles away thinking *most would NOT attend.* Guess again!\n\nJust saying that the whole \"Ohhh\\~most of them won't attend!\" doesn't always work out that way!!", "NTA...  it's a gift grab and very disrespectful\n\nFYI I come from the same superstations and I didn't have a baby shower until after the baby was born...", "NTA. It's kind of you to offer to host at all, and completely reasonable that there are limits to your generosity.", "NTA. You seem to have done your due diligence. Your MIL set a guest limit; you should communicate that limit to your SIL and tell her that you're not willing to work outside of those parameters. If she's unwilling to compromise then you could wash your hands of the whole deal knowing that you did all you could.", "This is so easily solvable by having a single conversation \"hey MIL said her house can only fit 30 people so we need you to pare the list down\". It's not much more complicated than that. \n\n>Why would you invite people you know won't come?\n\nSo that they won't be insulted they didn't get the invite.", "NTA, I completely get wanting to invite only the people you want to actually be there. But I went through something very similar with my wedding. Due to my wife's culture, she had to invite many many people that literally couldn't come (lived on a completely different continent without the ability to come to our country), and total for our wedding invited over 1k people. SOmetimes it's something where they invite people just for courtesy and don't understand the difference", "NTA. I'm in the opposite problem. I have a baby due June and we're having the baby shower in May. My mother somehow got 50+ people to agree to come and i didn't even know she knew that many people. I think talking to your AIL and MIL about this will be beneficial.", "NTA\n\nA baby shower should be in a private setting with people close to you, like family and friends. Don't let yourself get bothered by those questions, you SIL probably just wanted more presents or wanted to make a statement of how many friends she has.\n\nI personally would make a limit of 20ish people", "NTA, organizing events is a really hard thing to do even in an ideal circumstance. \n\nOrganizing one with that much people as a variable? No wayyy", "NTA. I don't even understand the point of baby showers. We don't have that here. But the first things my wife needed when we had our first and second child were peace and quiet. Two to three people a day could come by the first few days.", "ESH. You guys really should have communicated through ideas and expectations before we got to this point and now its a situation that's likely to leave a bad taste in some mouths.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
