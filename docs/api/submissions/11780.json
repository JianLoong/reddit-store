Mind your business. Sheesh.", "YTA\n\nAlthough I understand, you still can't do it. You could say to them something like \"hey I noticed some expired things, I could toss them for you if you'd like\" if they say no, leave it at that. Do not push it. People are being down right aggressive and mean as hell in these comments though, holy hell", "Watch an episode of hoarders and see how well it goes when they do this - hint: it usually ends in a breakdown from the person whose stuff got thrown out. Don\u2019t do this, but DO get them help.", "YWBTA\n\nWhy are you going through your in laws bed side table?", "YTA. The only thing you should throw away is spoiled perishables. Other than that, anything, even 6 yr expired canned goods are off limits unless they are likely to explode.", "Sounds like your in-laws are hoarders. That\u2019d would be the worst thing you could do. If you\u2019re that uncomfortable which is understandable, you need to decline the house sitting and tell them why if they ask.", "I feel like this is the best answer. There are ways to help people with a hoarding problem, but tossing their stuff isn't one of them.", "Or call and say \u201cI\u2019m clearing out this drawer for my clothes I\u2019ll put everything in this box\u201d", "Expiration dates on unopened pantry item are meaningless.", "If you have the airbnb funds... Go to one. Your husband can house sit. But if you throw away even an expired bag of chips, YTA.", "Clarify what????? You staying in an AirBnB vs their house has nothing to do with you throwing other people's stuff away!!!! OMG you have to live out of a duffle bag?!?!? The horror of it!!!! Would you let them throw stuff out in your house that they assume you're not using or might be old???? You are clearly an AH and WBTMAH if you touched other people's stuff!!!!", "There was no reason at all for this comment to be downvoted like this, wth", " I think it's being downvoted because she's missing it even in her own statement. The fact she acknowledged that her mother in law was concerned about breaking ins and thefts, but OP was ok throwing stuff out while MIL wasn't there and it was being done behind her back...it don't see it?  OP in her own way would be committing the crime that mother in law was trying to avoid", "YWBTA this is not your home. Live out of the duffel for a few weeks and make do with limited fridge space.", "YWBTA.  Don't ever throw out someone else's stuff behind their back.  Even if it's expired or what you think is just trash.  It's not your place to decide what they can and cannot have in their own home.", "Who the hell do you think you are? YWBTA", "Can you I don\u2019t know ask?", "it's not your house nor your stuff so **leave it alone**\n\nYWBTA", "What the fuck is wrong with you? What an entitled asshole. YWBTA. In fact, you already are.", "I need to ask...\n\nWhat would you say or do if you were the one whose things were thrown away? Just chucked because someone else decided to for whatever reason. I have a feeling you would not like that.\n\nYWBTA", "Yta", "YWBTA. Plain and simple. Don\u2019t fuck with other peoples stuff.", "YTA.  Can you just contact them and ask if it would be all right?  It's not your home.  Didn't you know the condition of their house before staying with them?  It's also only three weeks.  Just find a clear spot, if possible, even if it's not where you want it to be, and use that in the meantime.  Don't throw any of their stuff away or move it.  If this space issue was such a problem, you should have stuck to the Airbnb and said no to them.", "YWBTA:  DO NOT THROW ANYTHING AWAY.  You can't go into someone else's home and make decisions on their belongings!  I don't care how bad it is or how inconvenienced you are - it is a hard NO.  I know you're doing them somewhat of a favor housesitting for them but that doesn't give you a free pass to throw stuff away.", "You would be the asshole if you did that. It's not your house. Don't throw away shit that doesn't belong to you. It's not a hard concept to understand. Children know this.", "YWBTA. It's not your stuff don't touch It's really simple", "YTA, you don't have automatic right to use their pantry shelves or their drawers. Live out of a suitcase, it's only a few weeks. Or pick up a couple cheap plastic cartons to use.\n\nIf you want to throw expired things out of the fridge, you text to ask them first. Are they 100% out of communication range?", "YWBTA", "NTA if you speak to the in-laws FIRST to see how they feel about it.  They might be thrilled.  But if done without their consent first, then YWBTA.", "Expired food is fine, but anything else would be impossibly rude.", "NTA. When my wife's grandparents, her and our kids went on vacation for a week, I stayed back for work. During that time I purged the kitchen of expired food and cleaned the fridge. There were decade old expired stuff I was cleaning out. Depression kids keep things forever.  I would say only toss expired food and leave the rest.", "yeah like, why is she asking her husband if she can clean it? Why doesn\u2019t she ask the in laws? They can even phrase it in a nice way, something like \u201chey we noticed there\u2019s a bunch of stuff about to expire, would you like us to clean it out so you don\u2019t want to worry about it when you get home?\u201d", "You could move things to make room\u2026 going straight to trashing someone else\u2019s stuff is very bizarre\u2026", "Yeah I understand that, but she's just clarifying about why she is staying there. It could have made the situation more understandable or made it worse. Regardless, the more information the better, and she wasn't arguing the judgment", " But she isn't being downvoted because she ended up staying there versus an airBNB."]}
