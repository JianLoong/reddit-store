My MIL seemed very concerned about break-ins and car theft (they live in an area where cars go missing a lot more than average).

But, to people who hoard, it doesn't feel that way. It can be very upsetting. I doubt they'd want to come back home from their trip to feel distress at the idea that their home has been changed. Afterall, they've entrusted their space and belongings to you guys. \n\nI can also understand wanting to put stuff in temporary storage and then putting the stuff back where you found it before they come back, so you have SOME place to put your stuff. \n\nThe thing is, it's THEIR home, THEIR things. And it's not our business, as temporary guests (unless there is a safety issue or health issue risk) what they do and have in their home. We may not like it, but we don't get to change it. Especially if you guys are being done a favor too (not having to live in a construction zone) while they're away.

Don't take advantage.", "They will get upset about you throwing things away, even if they have \"expired\" (not everyone follows expiry dates).

You volunteer so much completely unnecessary information and judgement... to win us over to your side?\n\n You're judging them for their TikTok food hobby. You're judging them for eating out for every meal. You're judging them for not having a drawer ready for you, as if a box on a shelf(drawer) vs a box on wheels(suitcase) will make any considerable difference. \"Best by\" shelf stable food often isn't actually expired.

If there isn\u2019t room for your toiletries in the shower move theirs somewhere and put them back before you leave. \n\nOne time I was house sitting and I found a can in the pantry of fruit so expired (by years) that it was literally bulging out, presumably teaming with food poisoning. So I through it out. You know that lady came to me later and said did you throw away that can - I said yes and explained she was saving it because she liked the label. \ud83d\ude33 you just never know - and people use face creams etc after expiration - don\u2019t do it.", "YWBTA.

I'd suggest going through the stuff you want to chuck out (anything that's out of date for instance) and giving them a call, and calmly/respectively telling them what's out of date, see if they want you to chuck it out. Maybe take a picture of the items and sending it to them. Basically check with them first, let them know what's out of date. \n\nAlso explain to them that you'd also like to make some room in the drawers, while you and your husband are staying there, so you have a place to put some of your stuff, and that you'd like to put some stuff into boxes while you're staying at their house.", "YWBTA Not your stuff and it's not in your home.

Embrace that you have a place to stay; focus on gratitude.", "YWBTA if you did that.  MOVING things in the fridge to make room for some food would be OK since they would have expected you to use the fridge and pitching any open food or leftover takeout would also be acceptable.  Pitching anything else would be an AH move and TOUCHING anything in their drawers would be a total violation of their privacy. \n\nAdd up how much it would cost you for the Air B&B you were going to use then add in how much you normally spend for groceries and meals out.  Use that fund for getting takeout or going out for meals-- I HIGHLY suspect that you'll come out significantly shead after the next two weeks.", "YWBTA.
