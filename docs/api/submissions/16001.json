It is not your job to \"take care of him\", sick or not. Especially not, though, when you are also ill, and you have a child to worry about. \n\nIn fact, since we can safely assume that your BF is a grown man, it's actually really concerning that he was worried about you not prioritising him when there was a sick child in the home. His priorities are really messed up, and he needs a rethink on what it means to be a responsible parent. He should have been HELPING YOU take care of your child, since you were all ill, so that all the work and exhaustion didn't fall on only one of the two adults in the house.", "NTA; a real father will never prioritize himself before his child. If he's considerate, why didn't he ask how are you, how is his child, and how can he help you with the chores? You are his girlfriend, neither his mother nor his maid.

Your boyfriends logic is insane- if you were both sick, why on earth is HE more worthy of being taken care of than you?

I remember my mom had pneumonia while my dad had the flu and he snapped at her that he wasn\u2019t going to get the doorbell because he was supposed to be resting, even though she was way more sick than him.

I've asked gay friends before and I'll ask again...what on earth do you guys do when you are both sick? One friend told me they laugh at how cis couples deal with colds and flu.\n\nGirl, you are NTA.
