You do not have to care for him AND your child", "Info: Why aren't you mad that your bf didn't help take care of you, and his child when he knows you are sick? Shouldn't that be a two way street?\n\nNTA", "NTA. If he pulled that shit with me I would have turned the air blue with the words I'd have for him. You're not his mother and he's not a child. He needs to grow the fuck up and stop being jealous of a toddler.", "This is absolutely absurd. Your boyfriend has a male fragility problem, he\u2019s an immature baby, and he needs to grow up. Sounds like he didn\u2019t help take care of the toddler either? You\u2019re not his mother. NTA", "Um. Your boyfriend knows that he isn\u2019t technically a toddler too, right? If anything, you should be mad at him for not helping you care for your child when you were *both* sick. This relationship sounds\u2026less than ideal.", "NTA\n\nBy his own argument, if you were both sick, then he should have been taking care of you.\n\nYou're his GF, not his mom. It is not your job to \"take care of him\", sick or not. Especially not, though, when you are also ill, and you have a child to worry about. \n\nIn fact, since we can safely assume that your BF is a grown man, it's actually really concerning that he was worried about you not prioritising him when there was a sick child in the home. His priorities are really messed up, and he needs a rethink on what it means to be a responsible parent. He should have been HELPING YOU take care of your child, since you were all ill, so that all the work and exhaustion didn't fall on only one of the two adults in the house.", "NTA; a real father will never prioritize himself before his child. If he's considerate, why didn't he ask how are you, how is his child, and how can he help you with the chores? You are his girlfriend, neither his mother nor his maid. He should learn how to stop being so egotistical. Being a parent means making sacrifices, big or small... you are doing it, to which I salute you, but what about him?", "NTA\n\nManflu strikes again.", "NTA but your boyfriend definitely is.", "Has he always been a selfish child?", "NTA. Tell your boyfriend that he\u2019s not a child, and is more than capable of tending to himself and assisting with your son, sick or not", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is a selfish AH who desperately needs to grow up. Of course your priority was your son\u2019s wellbeing while you were sick; he\u2019s literally two years old and cannot look after himself. The fact your boyfriend doesn\u2019t appear to understand that and is whining about how you apparently \u2018left him to suffer\u2019 are huge red flags.\n\nMy advice is to be honest with yourself about how else he fails to clear the bar as a decent partner to you and parent to your son, and decide whether either of you deserve it.", "Was he busy caring for you and your son while he was sick? Was he dragging his sorry ass out of bed to take care of your toddler? Bringing you soup and popsicles in bed? Or was this a you wait on both of us while I lie there sick situation. \n\nNTA.  Boyfriend needs to learn you\u2019re not his mom.", "OP, you sure you don't have 2 kids? A 5 year old and 2 year old? Why would you opt to date a child? That's child abuse love. NTA", "If your BF is so sick that he can\u2019t get out of bed and warm up a can of soup or measure out a couple of pills and plump his own pillow, then he needs to go to the hospital. Somebody there can wait on him hand and foot and he will even get a *call button* if he wants something. I roll my eyes.\n\nOP, you had to take care of the two year old. Unless your BF is actively in crisis, the kid comes first. I am appalled that he might think otherwise. NTA", "NTA. Your boyfriends logic is insane- if you were both sick, why on earth is HE more worthy of being taken care of than you? The fact that he expected you to care for him while sick (and clearly he wasn\u2019t willing to do the same for you) is ridiculous. Of course you\u2019re going to care for your kid!! Please dump him. You deserve to be appreciated and cared for, not made to feel guilty for prioritizing your child.", ">My boyfriend has expressed to me that his feelings are hurt\n\nNTA - You had to take care of the other baby.", "NTA, the flashbacks this post just gave me\u2026my parents marriage has been like this for 45 years, and as someone who has spent their whole life watching my mom be miserably unhappy, I want to tell you now that unless you want to spend a lifetime being taken for granted and treated like you don\u2019t matter, get out now. I remember my mom had pneumonia while my dad had the flu and he snapped at her that he wasn\u2019t going to get the doorbell because he was supposed to be resting, even though she was way more sick than him. Your boyfriend is not going to change, or start contributing equally, or prioritize your well being, ever. He won\u2019t change.", "NTA. Did your boyfriend take care of YOU? Did he help care for his sick CHILD? What an AH he is.", "NTA\n\nI've never understood how the race of men could survive fever in the trenches of WWI (they were not allowed off the lines unless their fever was over some ungodly number of 102-103) and yet not survive a cold or flu in their own home. \n\nPut the race of men in a relationship with a woman and they cannot stand the common cold or a case of the flu without their woman, there by their side, ready to serve them, waiting on them hand and foot, heroically forsaking all others, (such as joint offspring), persevering through her own fever, illness and suffering so that she may assuage her man's suffering for after all he is what's important here.\n\n Word. I've asked gay friends before and I'll ask again...what on earth do you guys do when you are both sick? One friend told me they laugh at how cis couples deal with colds and flu.\n\nGirl, you are NTA. Tell your husband it's his turn to wipe up your kids puke. That's parenting...he needs to be part of the solution, not a drain on resources. Seriously, dude needs to touch his inner Dad and do what's right.", "NTA. sounds like you have 2 children", "NTA, poor you, you have a BF that needs taken care of. What a weak prick, sorry OP, but seriously! Had a baby just leading into covid (well technically my wife had, we are traditional like that!) both of us have had covid, as had the baby and our 17yr old. We all worked together to help each other (except the baby, hes not a team player apparently) we just all did what we could to support each other. No one got hurt etc, we got shit done. Personally, when im sick, i want NO help, just wana solo it out (which, shocker, suits my wife). This isnt politically correct, but, OP\u2019s BF needs to man the fuk up. Again, NTA, and good on you for pushing through and looking after your wee man, when BF \u2018couldnt\u2019", "Info. Did he care for you or your child at any point?", "Why didn't your boyfriend care for you? Why is he so pathetic he can't even care for his sick girlfriend?", "NTA - Your bf is pretty pathetic.", "NTA\n\nMate Gabor said in an interview that statistically women recover from heart attacks at an alarmingly lower rate then men, precisely because even when they are unwell, when they are at home, they are expected to care for the family. They don't have the chance and peace to recover unburdened, because (as the professional said) men are socialized to expect to be cared for.\n\nYour boyfriend can shove his hurt little boy feelings up patriarchy's b*tt.
