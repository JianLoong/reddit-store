It is not your job to \"take care of him\", sick or not. Especially not, though, when you are also ill, and you have a child to worry about. \n\nIn fact, since we can safely assume that your BF is a grown man, it's actually really concerning that he was worried about you not prioritising him when there was a sick child in the home. His priorities are really messed up, and he needs a rethink on what it means to be a responsible parent. He should have been HELPING YOU take care of your child, since you were all ill, so that all the work and exhaustion didn't fall on only one of the two adults in the house.", "NTA; a real father will never prioritize himself before his child.

There are a lot (I'm not saying all or even most, but a lot) of men who share your bf's point of view.  My father used to be one of them.  In all fairness, he kind of came by his misguided view honestly.\n\nMy grandmother was a nurse before she married my grandfather and went on hiatus (this was when married women didn't work, but she returned to nursing after he pre-deceased her).  Her mother died in a flu epidemic.  My grandmother also got the flu real bad.  She tended to take very good care of her sons when they were sick, especially if it was the flu.\n\nThe first couple of years of their marriage, my mom took good care of Dad when he was sick.  Then I came along.  In addition to being extremely susceptible to the flu, I also had reflux, a milk allergy, and chronic ear infections.  They both walked the floor with me.  Then Dad got sick.  Mom focused on me and he had to fend for himself.  He observed to my grandmother that Mom didn't take care of him as good as Gram did.  My mom says he wasn't really complaining, but that's how Gram took it.  Gram told him in no uncertain terms that she took care of him because he was too little to take care of himself and she was a stay-at-home mom.  Then she told him that if he was old enough to be married and have a child of his own, he was old enough to heat up his own soup and fluff his own pillow.  Finally, she told him that unless she (and the rest of the family) had missed something pretty major, my mother only had one child and he wasn't it.\n\nDad takes care of himself now.  I mean, he doesn't even ask mom to drive him to the ER when he cuts himself with a saw or something.\n\nMy bf's mom also tended to baby him when he was sick.  Fortunately for me, he got impatient with it and never expected me to take care of him.  Even better, he turned out to be a great caregiver.  If I got sick, he dropped off soups and clear liquids to keep me hydrated, picked up prescriptions, whatever he could do.  When I had knee surgery and had a terrible reaction to the latex involved in the surgery (gloves, drains, etc.) and could barely stand to look at the swollen, oozing, mess that was my knee, he said he'd clean it up.  Then he started talking to me about who knows what.  Finally, I said, \"When are you going to start on my knee?\"  He responded, \"Let me just put this last piece of tape on the bandage and we're done.\"  Seriously, he was so gentle, I never even knew he was working on it.\n\nYour bf was/is way out of line.

When both hubby and I are sick, we tag team parenting (swap out at meal times or earlier if up to it) .

Our patients really *need* these terms to understand themselves and explain their conditions to others. That gets infinitely harder when everyone thinks that schizophrenia is multiple personality disorder, when people that having a hard time is PTSD, when being organized is OCD, etc, etc. \n\nBeyond your correct definition of gaslighting, it is where perpetrators *systematically* engage in behaviors that cause the victim to question reality and their own sanity. It usually starts about very small things no one would lie about (ie, we didn't have meatloaf for dinner last night, we ordered pizza, are you feeling okay?) and escalates over time to the point where the victim no longer trusts what they remember or know to be true."]}
