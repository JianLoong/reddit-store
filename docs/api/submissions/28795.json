I don\u2019t think so man. You\u2019re already being generous, a part of their life actively, and aren\u2019t trying to withhold the money and such left to them by their father. You don\u2019t owe anything more. I\u2019m sure there must be something in the custody paperwork you signed (if you signed that with your husband?) that discusses what should happen in the event of passing. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to struggle through this it\u2019s not fair to you or any of these children", "NTA. You are under no obligation to coparent these kids. It's nice that you're doing do it for them and for your kids, but it's not custody. Their mom could take them from you at a moment's notice and never let you see them again and there's nothing you could do about it. \n\nIf you haven't already, I would get a lawyer to stop her from harassing you and to learn what your rights are.", "Her kids are the estate's problem, not yours. (Other than you are probably the executrix of the estate.)\n\nMy question about the visitation is what do the kids, both yours and hers, think about it. Do they want to visit with each other? In your story, you didn't mention their relationship and interaction. \n\nShe's being way extra, there is no way that you owe these children support. The estate might, but you personally, no. And your personal income has nothing to do with the amount that the estate owes. As to the \"custody arrangement\", you aren't their parent, you don't have an obligation to care for them as your husband did.\n\nIt sounds like you probably need a lawyer. NTA", "NTA. \nBut I am curious. You watch her kids. \nDo your kids go to her place?", "NTA.\n\nGet a lawyer if you don't have one already.  You're not a parent or guardian, you don't have any legal claim, and no responsibility.  Just because you didn't change the schedule before doesn't mean you can't change it now.  Stop talking to her and be clear that until any legal issues are resolved the kids aren't to come over - and don't giver her a penny more, she got what was hers through HIS life, that responsibility ended with him and it's not yours.\n\nAgain, get a lawyer now.", "NTA, I don't know where you are, but if you are in the United States she's smoking something.  You are not those kids' parent.  She cannot force you to take them.  Honestly, I don't think she can even force an actual parent to take them.  She also can't get child support as again, you are not their parent.  She should be getting social security.  This woman is nuts and simply doesn't want to deal with her own kids.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t agree to custody, get out of here. At 15/16, why do you still have them 50% of the time? I would assume by now they\u2019re busy with school/extracurricular/friends. She\u2019s using you to get a break.\n\nYou aren\u2019t obligated to financially support them either. Assuming you\u2019re in US, she should have been getting social security for the kids.", "Do you have a lawyer?", "Oh no!

Unfortunately for his ex, you don't owe her custody split or child support anymore. She is likely able to get some kind of SS survivor benefit for the kids and your sale of his assets has been providing as well. She may be overwhelmed as a single mom, but you're a single mom now too and need to be able to do things with your kids that work for your schedule rather than being restricted by hers.", "I get wanting the kids to grow up together. But why the heck would you keep the same visitation schedule? You don't have custody of her children? Let alone pay her child support? That's too much cray for me.\n\nThat is asking for a lot IMO. NTA. Let your lawyer attack right back, She can ask for anything in court. That doesn't mean she'll get what she asks for, though.", "NTA- she\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m surprised a lawyer is entertaining this.", "What the hell?", "NTA but the financial thing might screw you. You have established support for the kids, which she might now get an idiot of a judge to believe is support. Please tell me the money is in trust accounts that pay out to her every month? \n\nI would immediately cut off all contact. If the kids want to know why, they are old enough to be told the truth, so do so.

This woman is ridiculous! She is taking advantage of you!

You can tell her to eff right off and you still would not be TA.", "NTA.  I knew she was just going to be after money.  Ignore her bs about child support.  Present her with a bill for all of the babysitting you've done along with anything else that you've paid for for them.", "NTA", "NTA, you're getting scammed for free child care by someone your deceased husband used to know.  the kids are not yours, they _were_ his, but he is no longer alive.  \n\nShe's getting support from him, post-divorce, post-death.  Cut her off.", "NTA", "I never signed anything regarding custody as it was established by the time we had met/married.", "All 4 kids are very very close .. which is why I let it go on for so long. I've spoken to the older 2 about the situation and why I'm making the decision I am so they aren't blindsided. They also know they're welcome back at 18 when she doesn't have to be involved in anyway.", "Never. She said because they never did before my husband died there's no reason for it to start now.", "I'm in Canada.\nI honestly think I have them that much still because they want to be here because she's always off doing her own thing but if I ever took them somewhere on \"my time\" she'd probably charge me with kidnapping.", "I consulted with one previously and he laughed and said \"ignore her\" but now I'm in the process of consulting with others since she has one who has since served me papers and seems very convinced I owe her and clearly I can't ignore this anymore.", "Thats why I'm so confused???", "I dont give her anything out of my pocket. There were trusts set up by my husband pre death for school etc and then the estate lawyer I dealt with set up another trust where she gets money monthly that stops when the youngest turns 18.", "Then the best she\u2019s got you on is a verbal contract it seems.
