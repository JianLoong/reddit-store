Yes, that's completely unreasonable as well as a bit unhinged but...look what you're dealing with. First, I seriously doubt it would make to a courtroom, but if it did the judge would take a look at the facts and explain in very small words that there is not a transfer of custody upon death when there is another living parent. That's like transferring a premarital debt to you after his passing - it's not your responsibility. Is it nice that you're able to continue your role in their lives? Yes, it is.

Why should you be the only one absorbing the childcare and the costs that go along with it while in your care. It seems like a very one sided arrangement considering you are both essentially single moms/one income households now. His kids all have an inheritance they will eventually get, there\u2019s absolutely no reason you could be forced to any kind of custody agreement.", "You should both be getting survivor benefits through social security as well. It sounds like she has enough money. You are in no way responsible to give her more. Get an attorney and tell her that she can contact your attorney about it. That might actually make her back off.", "NTA but check with your lawyer.", "Canada.\nMy husband knew he was going to die (cancer) so it was set up through his own decision to have a trust to pay \"child support\" until the youngest was 18 so he knew they'd be fine.", "Agreed.  They can\u2019t give legal advice on the internet, if they are a lawyer they would lose their license!", "So she gets to do her own thing but your supposed to operate around her schedule? Cut the cord with her.  The kids are old enough to have a separate relationship with you and your kids.", "You must be one hell of a step mom for them to keep this up over the years. I think your husband would be so proud. And judging from how their mom behaves, I'm really glad they have you. \nNTA", "Did you receive anything from a lawyer or is she just lying about it?\n\nETA ever mind, I kept reading. Definitely hire a lawyer and sue her for the lawyers fees and the time you spend having to deal with this. Your time and peace of mind is valuable, she\u2019s abusing it.", "It's possible she misrepresented the situation to her lawyer in order to get him to take the case. Even if it's something that will very obviously not hold up to more than the most cursory scrutiny, she wouldn't be the first person dumb enough to try something like that.", "Oh she has been taking you for a good long ride.  Wow.  Let her yell and fuss. You legally have no obligation to her or her kids.  You are not blood related, you did not adopt them there is no legal tie.  She is just upset that she can\u2019t fob them off on you anymore.  \n\nSit down with the kids.  Explain things. And go finally live your life.", "I am reeling, this is madness!  I am so sorry you have been taken advantage of so much. Please do an update, many here are rooting for you.", "Depends on the teenager!", "Good girl. Let her take you to court. You have not paid \"child support\", the trust has given money to her.", "The ex does not have any basis in law to sue you. She's probably hoping you'll give in and continue to let her use you for babysitting purposes.\n\nAdditional free resource if you want: r/legaladvicecanada", "Uch, it must be so stressful for you", "Okay, but still a good indicator of why they split up.", "I have no doubt that when the money dries up when the youngest turns 18 they\u2019ll be knocking at your door. NTA. Protect yourself. Let the kids know why you are doing what you are", "So. Hard.\n\nReally? \ud83d\ude3f", "There\u2019s no verbal contract that would hold up for custody issues. There is not a single law that ex wife could use to make OP take custody, it\u2019s ridiculous.", ">Then the best she\u2019s got you on is a verbal contract it seems. I\u2019d maybe consider a lawyer if she wants to fight you\n\nA verbal contract to raise someone else's children?\n\nWhy do people insist on giving legal advice when they clearly have no idea.", "Your husband sounds like he was a good man and loving father. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.\n\nedit: typo", "Wait, the trust was paying child support already and now she wants more child support from you? How does that work, that she gets two child support payments for the same children?", "Pretty much, she's even mentioned in passing that if I start to date again that he isn't allowed around her kids so he can't come over when they are here lol", "I forgot that that teenagers these days are, for the most, spoiled and entitled.", "With the ages they are I'd waste so much money trying to get full custody to not owe her anything and then they'd be 18 anyways. They already know at 18 years old they are 100% welcome.", "You actually don\u2019t know that. Laws vary greatly by locality. We have no idea where these people are", "Verbal custody agreements, also known sometimes as informal parenting plans, are very much a real thing and are one element of many that an upset co-parent can bring to the table to draw out a legal custody battle.", ">Why do people insist on giving legal advice\n\nYou litteraly quoted the part where the commenter said to get a lawyer", "Thankyou, he really really was.", "Wow! The audacity! No words for how badly she's taken advantage of you!", "Yeah no, she means her kids can\u2019t come over if a boyfriend is there. You should point out that means she\u2019ll have to call ahead if they ever want to visit and that means no more you watching them while she\u2019s \u201con vacation\u201d. Watch how fast she backpedals.\n\nBut seriously, don\u2019t do this. Talk to a lawyer, draft a legal letter (maybe a cease and desist??) that keeps her from contacting you and verifies the children are provided for through the estate and she is not to drop them off etc etc. \n\nAnd thank you for discussing it first with the older kids so they know you still care for them and it\u2019s their mom causing the problems.", "She honestly sounds abusive. The level of cover I've control she's exercising over you is alarming. I'm not quite sure who the hell she thinks she is but she knows she's been on to a very good thing for years and is seeing how far she can take it. You are grieving the loss of your husband and caring for your own children. That is enough to keep anyone busy without the stress of her dictating to you. I would tell the children they are welcome to come by when they like for dinner/to hang out, etc, just text first to make sure you're going to be there, and knock this 50:50 nonsense on the head. It sounds like sometimes you have them more than she does, in which case she ought to be paying you child support.", "You sound like such a wonderful person. I can see why the kids want to be at your home, they might prefer you all around.  I would tell them before I put their mom into place you are doing this for reasons that have nothing to do with them as people and you will always be family to them.  This is just about some personal things you need to do for yourself to heal, but will spend time with them in the future no matter.  Please don't let her manipulate you any more.", "You need to tell the kids that the 50/50 is stopping, but they can still come and hang out and have sleep overs like they would with other friends. You need to put this boundary in place with your late husbands ex as well and ask a lawyer for help with that.", "That\u2019s very lovely of you.\n\nI\u2019m sure your attorney will serve you well. Breathe.", "But, OP's *husband* was the co-parent. She's not a co-parent to the ex's kids at all. I'd assume any co-parenting obligations were rendered null and void at the time of his passing. Took it to his grave, as it were."]}
