You say he has an apartment already. Okay. Does he actually LIVE there? Because your post states he comes \"home\" to what I think is your place, right? So does he de facto live with you? If he pretty much lives with you then he should be helping there. Bills and labor. If he eats there he needs to wash dishes. Or he can go home to HIS apartment and eat and do dishes there instead. \n\nHaving his own apartment doesnt mean he can treat you like crap in YOUR apartment all while making it totally YOUR problem to take care of. \n\nYou didnt understand a leeching comment earlier.
