As my boyfriend wasn't home, I put his dish into the fridge and ate mine.\n\nWhen he got home, he was kinda grumpy. I was in bed because I was again hurting a lot.

Guy can't reheat his own meal? He cares more about having you serve him a hot meal than he cares about your health! No, you don't take heavy narcotics just to keep the peace. That's not peaceful for YOU. NTA!! Let him go to his own apartment and stay there. You don't deserve to be treated as a servant!", "NTA. He \"told you\" to get his meal? Asking a partner to do something for you is obviously fine, but if he's ordering you around then he can take that attitude back to his apartment and sit there alone with it. And him deciding to just be hungry and thirsty in protest out of spite is literally toddler behavior, like I've literally seen my cousin's three year-old do that when her mom wouldn't bring her snack to the living room sofa.", "What the fuck? I'm loathed to jump straight to 'dump him' on this sub but holy shit, is this normal? He sounds incredibly controlling. NTA.", "NTA he sounds childish, controlling and petty. Ditch him!", "NTA and what? \"He told me to bring him water and his meal\"??? So, you're his servant?\n\nOP, I'm concerned about how you must feel about yourself that you can possibly think you are in the wrong here? It is beyond unacceptable that he just comes in and orders you to serve him.\n\n\"Fine, then I won't eat and I will be thirsty\". I mean, that's just pathetic. And also manipulative. He's a 32 year old man who's not capable of microwaving an already-prepared meal and pouring a glass of water? How is he still alive?\n\nIf I were you I would take him up on his offer of not coming back next week, and extend that to forever. \n\nAnd again, I really think you need to question why you are willing to let someone treat you like this. I don't have the perfect marriage or even close, but I honestly cannot even imagine my husband having the audacity to order me to serve him!", "This guy sounds like a right prick, OP. Perhaps he should stay at his own place. \n\nYou were ill and he felt like you getting up simply to reheat food and bring him a glass of water was more important? I would never let my man get up and make me food if he was bedridden, wtf?! \n\nNTA. I hope this isn't common behaviour.", "NTA\n\nPlease throw the whole man away. Even if it weren\u2019t for the endo, which is brutal and no fucking joke, he\u2019d still be TA for ordering you around like he\u2019s your employer.", "NTA\nI also used to have these type of cramps, and almost passed out from pain if I tried to stand up. If anyone had DEMANDED something from me in that state I would be absolutely furious. \n\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like a real AH. Does he usually order you around and behave like this? If that's the case I would ask myself if this relationship really is healthy. Because if he often treats you like this I see some red flags here.", "NTA.  If he was severely disabled and literally couldn\u2019t get things himself, it\u2019d be more complicated.  Even then, it should be asking not telling, and a lot more empathy and kindness.\n\nBut no, this is an apparently functional adult man throwing a toddler\u2019s tantrum.  A good partner would be making sure you have what you need and asking if there was anything they should bring you or set up for you, not demanding you haul your sick self out of bed to serve them.  I suspect this is not the only time he has behaved as if you were his servant.  I\u2019d suggest you do some thinking over your relationship as a whole.", "NTA just a doormat.  Seriously how are you putting up with this guy?  You're his partner not his mother.  Let him go and find someone who deserves a good woman.  He expects you to wait on him even when you're sick?  You can do better.", ">\tThen he told me he will not come back next week because I treated him poorly. \n\n1) you didn\u2019t treat him poorly. Literally the exact opposite. You deserve so much better. \n\n2) not coming back sounds like a fantastic idea. Accept that offer!", "Wow. How does it feel to be dating a fucking baby. \n\nWah wah. Dump him - he needs a mama not a partner. NTA.", "You are definitely NTA. Even if you weren't having medical issues, it would not be OK for him to treat you like this.\n\nAsking a partner to help you is one thing.

I can re heat your dinner for my lunch tomorrow, wish I had someone to cook dinner for me. Then start looking for someone who will.", "NTA. Why can't your adult boyfriend reheat the meal that you already made for him? This is really concerning to be honest. \"I won't eat and I will be thirsty\"?? Naaahhh, bro can get his own food and water! Doesn't matter if it's his apartment! You deserve better than this.", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds like a very unhealthy relationship. You are not his slave, are you? He has his own hands and legs? He didn't even have to cook himself, just warm up.\nA normal partner would have asked you if he could do something for you.", "NTA. He sounds very unkind, and privileged. You can do better, not by getting a different partner, but simply by being unburdened with these guilt trips.", "NTA\u2026I think you should let the boyfriend go to his apartment, change your locks and dump his ass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
