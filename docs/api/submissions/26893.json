For example, they didn\u2019t tell us at all about them deciding to get married until 2-3 weeks before it happened. When they did tell us about it, family members were curious and wanted to be involved but Lucy was not happy for them to be involved. She only wanted her family in it.

Get married!", "A bit off topic, I just wanted to comment that you'll be getting married on a Friday. There's nothing wrong with this, but be prepared for some people to turn down the wedding invitation because of this. \n\nMy brother and sister-in-law got married early afternoon on a Friday, which made it really hard for people from out of town to commute. Not only did some have to take the Friday off from work, they also had to take the Thursday off to travel. While this is fine for some, not everyone has the the financial means or ability to take one-two days off for a wedding. \n\nWhen my brother got married, it was also the first week of the school year - a hectic time for many families with children. For myself, I had moved several hundred kilometres away earlier that week for post-graduate studies. The wedding made it extremely difficult to juggle an already typically busy time of the year with moving, new schedules, and extra travel. On top of that, the bride was upset that I did not have time that week to attend extra wedding activities (e.g., the wedding rehearsal or spending the night before the wedding with the other women in the wedding party - she overlooked that I couldn't attend these things because I was taking 6 -7 hours that evening to travel to the wedding - I didn't arrive in town until midnight). So even if people can attend the actual wedding, they might not necessarily be able to take part in other wedding activities\n\nYou should absolutely get married on a date that is significant for you - no questions asked. Just wanted to give a heads up (and maybe you've already considered this yourself) that some might not be able to attend the wedding itself or wedding-related activities precisely because it's on a Friday (especially if it's during the daytime on the Friday). I know other people turned down the invitation for my brother's wedding precisely for this reason. I also know it caused quite a bit of tension in my own family that I couldn't be part of any other activities the week of the wedding - the bride seemed to forget that other people have lives and she was not entitled to multiple days of someone else's time just because she was getting married (especially during the school/work week).", "NTA but maybe warn your wedding planner because honestly she sounds like the type to sabotage", "NTA.  Fianc\u00e9's brother and his wife can take their lies and sense of entitlement and get over it.  I hope that you and your fianc\u00e9 have a wonderful wedding!!", "NTA!! Holy mackerel!!

Don\u2019t make it yours. \n\nFor all you know they\u2019ll move the date or, as she did with their legal marriage, not invite folks from your fianc\u00e9\u2019s side.  That\u2019s what happen when you are so secretive no one else has a clue.  And her putting that lie about her customs didn\u2019t help her case. \n\nEnjoy your wedding - they can attend it not.", "NTA.\n\n Was it a \"they\" situation or has it been Lucy talking through the twin this whole time? What does the twin, independent of Lucy think?\n\nI ask because I've seen a manipulator do this sort of thing to convince the victim to back away from friends and family. \"See? They don't care about *us*?\" \"They don't want *us* to be happy.\" \"They would prefer if *we* weren't around.\" She made her victim think it was us vs them, not that we just didn't like her because we saw she was manipulative. Thankfully, we kept communication open, even when he cut himself off from us, so everyone was accepting when he left her.\n\nLucy's freak out was exactly like many that the family saw from the one I mentioned. Also the lying about the superstition. Was she lying to him and he relayed it or was he going along with it?\n\nI know I'm projecting my own experience. Just too many similarities for me not to feel bad for the twin.", "Nta! It\u2019s your wedding! You have no obligation to share your date or anything before it\u2019s booked.

So lucy can decide not to tell consult his wedding plans and date with you but you have to inform her everything?? What a hypocrite.", "NTA It\u2019s not your problem that they have some issue with your wedding date.

We broke both rules, and his mother is very superstitious. Everyone understood, no one was mad, and we all still have loving relationships with each other- because it turns out that normal people have empathy and care about family more than social clout.", "Or they have picked a date, but haven't told anyone.

Covid obviously threw a wrench in things, but we had yet to hear of any wedding plans at all when my now husband and I got engaged a year and a half later. \n\nWe had already planned a micro (parents and siblings only) wedding when we told our family of getting engaged. They had at that point been discussing finding a venue they loved that was available in December of that year. Well apparently since we got engaged second we couldn\u2019t possibly get married FIRST. Cue to them, having a hastily planned church wedding on the other side of the country and giving us all 2 weeks notice to fly out. Because god forbid they got married ya know, one month AFTER us at the wedding they had already put a deposit down and send save the dates for. But realized \u2018last minute\u2019 that it was \u2018important to them\u2019 to actually marry in the city they met or something (this was their response to some incredulous parents asking why they insisted on such last minute plans despite having already paid for a whole ass wedding already).", "Not to mention they are ALREADY married.
