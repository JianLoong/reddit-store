One thing I\u2019ve not mentioned is that I\u2019m from Malaysia and my fianc\u00e9 is from New Zealand where we both met and is residing in. We both decided that we\u2019ll be having our wedding in Malaysia as I have a very big family there and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s extended family that he\u2019d like to invite are mostly in Singapore. His parents and older sister is currently living in NZ and is happy to travel to Malaysia for the wedding as they can also visit relatives in Singapore whom they missed. \n\nNow when my fianc\u00e9 announced our wedding date to his family, we did it through video-call as we\u2019re not based in the same area. His parents, older sister, twin brother (Alex) and twin\u2019s wife-to-be was in the call. The moment we announced our date, everyone was overjoyed EXCEPT for the Alex\u2019s wife-to-be (Lucy). She yelled out \u201cWHAT?! THEY\u2019RE GETTING MARRIED BEFORE US?!\u201d and my fianc\u00e9 and I just looked at each other in shock. They then left the call abruptly. An hour later, Alex texted him saying that Lucy is very upset and they think that our wedding is going to overshadow theirs. Alex also mentioned that Lucy said there\u2019s a thing in her culture where 2 weddings within the same family cannot be within 3 months of each other or it\u2019ll bring bad luck to the second couple. We later found out this was just a lie. They\u2019re also angry at us for not discussing our wedding date with them first before announcing it to the family. Do we need their permission to get married on our special day? They also told us to change our wedding date in order to let them get married first before us. So we stood our ground and said no to date changing and told them that they\u2019re being unreasonable.\n\nA lil about Lucy and the Alex. They\u2019ve had their civil union in Lucy\u2019s country in early 2022, so legally they are married. However, there were some dodgy stuff happening BTS. For example, they didn\u2019t tell us at all about them deciding to get married until 2-3 weeks before it happened. When they did tell us about it, family members were curious and wanted to be involved but Lucy was not happy for them to be involved. She only wanted her family in it. Sadly my future-in-laws are upset. So Lucy and Alex wanted to do a church wedding in NZ now but haven\u2019t decided what to do and as you have guessed, no one knows what\u2019s happening on their end.
