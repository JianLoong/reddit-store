During Thanksgiving, I invited my classmates who stayed in town over for dinner, including one classmate who I will refer to as Cara. For reference, another classmate, Brenda, was also in town by did not join for Thanksgiving.\n\nFast forward a few months later, I heard Cara, Brenda, and another classmate Darren were arranging a holiday dinner for the New Years. I asked Cara if I could join, and Cara said sure but would have to check with Brenda and Darren first.\n\nA few days pass, I hear back from Cara saying that Darren had changed plans and was going back to visit their family. Since Darren was leaving, Brenda and Cara decided to do a girls night instead. This happened the day before the scheduled dinner. I was disappointed, especially since I had already purchased some food to bring for the dinner, but did not challenge their decision.\n\nThen a month later, I heard from Brenda that Brenda, Cara, Darren, and two additional classmates had a New Years dinner. Confused about this situation, I asked Cara a few days later to clarify what happened during New Years. Cara told me that she and Brenda had a girls night and then on the following week, Brenda arranged a dinner with the rest of the classmates. What irritated me was that Brenda had referred to this dinner as a New Years dinner, so in my mind it seem like they had simply moved the original plans without letting me know. I mentioned to Cara that I felt excluded especially since most of my classmates were invited.\n\nA few days after, another classmate, Edgar, who did not attend any of the outings, wrote a public post telling everyone to mind their own business and not to make other people uncomfortable. I confronted Edgar about their post privately saying they shouldn't make blanket statements. Edgar told me that Cara had told him that I had made her uncomfortable by asking about the dinner.\n\nTo summarize, AITA for asking my friend to clarify what happened? I understand that people are entitled to do whatever social activities with whomever they want and accept that. But I felt particularly hurt by Edgar making a public statement, especially as they were not involved with any of the events.\n\nEdit: For extra background, Cara and Darren had asked me if I celebrate the New Year. Initially, I said I was agnostic towards the holiday, but I took it as a soft invite and asked Cara to join a couple of days later. The actual dinner that took place a week after ended up being hosted and organized by Brenda, although to what degree Cara, Darren, or anyone else was involved in its planning I do not know as I did not ask further.\n\nEdit2: New Years is specifically Chinese New Years here. The graduate group is a mix of Americans and internationals who are mostly from Asia.", "created_utc": 1686387081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145v0uc/aita_for_asking_my_friend_about_why_i_was_not/", "score": 220, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were not told about the second party because you already tried to invite yourself to the original party when you weren\u2019t asked to begin with. The fact that you mention the Thanksgiving party at all seems to indicate that you feel \u201cowed\u201d an invitation to the NYE party, but that\u2019s not how party invitations (or friendship) works. \n\nIt seems clear to me that your fellow students didn\u2019t want to include you in their NYE celebration for a reason; whether or not they have a *good* reason to not want to be friends with you outside of school is irrelevant; either they\u2019re uncomfortable hanging out with you, or they\u2019re excluding you for no good reason because they\u2019re just jerks. Either way, these are not your friends.\n\nThe fact that this unrelated person (Edgar) felt the need to make this post tells me that unintentionally or not, you were causing drama amongst your classmates and pushing in where you aren\u2019t wanted. You felt excluded and that sucks; but if multiple people are now telling you they feel uncomfortable, especially people who weren\u2019t involved in any of the parties to begin with, then this social issue is now affecting school.

My thought is that at least Cara and likely Brenda and Darren aren't the kind of friends you thought they were, and that at least Cara has a superannuated mean girl thing going; excluding one member of a class who has already extended themselves for you is a definite mean girl move.

They all seem young too and I don't want to call OP the AH without all the facts, it reads to me like he assumed they were friends and they don't feel the same way. I feel bad for OPin that case and hope he wasn't alone for new years which it reads like. But yeah 100% agree with you on that one."]}
