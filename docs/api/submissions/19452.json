{"id": 19452, "submission_id": "145v0uc", "title": "AITA for asking my friend about why I was not invited for a holiday dinner?", "selftext": "To set up the context, I am a graduate student in a small department. During Thanksgiving, I invited my classmates who stayed in town over for dinner, including one classmate who I will refer to as Cara. For reference, another classmate, Brenda, was also in town by did not join for Thanksgiving.\n\nFast forward a few months later, I heard Cara, Brenda, and another classmate Darren were arranging a holiday dinner for the New Years. I asked Cara if I could join, and Cara said sure but would have to check with Brenda and Darren first.\n\nA few days pass, I hear back from Cara saying that Darren had changed plans and was going back to visit their family. Since Darren was leaving, Brenda and Cara decided to do a girls night instead. This happened the day before the scheduled dinner. I was disappointed, especially since I had already purchased some food to bring for the dinner, but did not challenge their decision.\n\nThen a month later, I heard from Brenda that Brenda, Cara, Darren, and two additional classmates had a New Years dinner. Confused about this situation, I asked Cara a few days later to clarify what happened during New Years. Cara told me that she and Brenda had a girls night and then on the following week, Brenda arranged a dinner with the rest of the classmates. What irritated me was that Brenda had referred to this dinner as a New Years dinner, so in my mind it seem like they had simply moved the original plans without letting me know. I mentioned to Cara that I felt excluded especially since most of my classmates were invited.\n\nA few days after, another classmate, Edgar, who did not attend any of the outings, wrote a public post telling everyone to mind their own business and not to make other people uncomfortable. I confronted Edgar about their post privately saying they shouldn't make blanket statements. Edgar told me that Cara had told him that I had made her uncomfortable by asking about the dinner.\n\nTo summarize, AITA for asking my friend to clarify what happened? I understand that people are entitled to do whatever social activities with whomever they want and accept that. But I felt particularly hurt by Edgar making a public statement, especially as they were not involved with any of the events.\n\nEdit: For extra background, Cara and Darren had asked me if I celebrate the New Year. Initially, I said I was agnostic towards the holiday, but I took it as a soft invite and asked Cara to join a couple of days later. The actual dinner that took place a week after ended up being hosted and organized by Brenda, although to what degree Cara, Darren, or anyone else was involved in its planning I do not know as I did not ask further.\n\nEdit2: New Years is specifically Chinese New Years here. The graduate group is a mix of Americans and internationals who are mostly from Asia.\n\nEdit3: To be clear, I did not know that the two events, the girl's night and the dinner, were separate until I spoke with Cara. I was confused and had asked because it sounded like they were the same event.", "created_utc": 1686387081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145v0uc/aita_for_asking_my_friend_about_why_i_was_not/", "score": 349, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you interested?\"\n\nIt's another to say, \"If you and Beth are getting drinks, can I join you?\"\n\nIt's even worse when it's something people are hosting, so that you're asking them to spend money on you.", "She absolutely got back to him. She told him the day before. Maybe the others hadn't gotten back to her until then. And it was only a few days before that he invited himself along.", "So because you offered help here and there, you think that entitles you to invites to all the parties?", "No, I do not think that. I added this to give some context that we are not total strangers. She has the right to invite who she wants. But it does feel like she is giving me the cold shoulders when it comes to social outings whilst also at the same asking me for favors.", "You don't want to call OP the asshole without all the facts, but you seem to be willing to call them the assholes, ignoring the facts that OP posted.   \n\n\nHe asked to be invited to a party. She said she wouldn't mind, but had to ask everyone else. She told him the party was canceled and they were doing a girl's night, in effect, telling him no.  \n\n\nLater, they have another party that he *also* isn't invited to. They never invited him, so there was no reason to tell him. He saw a post about the party later and was annoyed that he wasn't invited. Just because he invited himself to the first one, and had a tentative yes until it was canceled, that doesn't entitle him to an invite to the second one.", "That's because she doesn't want to hang out with you socially. If, as a result, you don't want to do her favors, then don't. What you seem to think is that, if you ingratiate yourself to people, they will feel obligated to invite you to a party. That's not a good way to try and create social interaction.", "They told him it was cancelled the day prior.. Also from what I remember in the post, could be mistaken, they didn't confirm plans with him until the day prior either. They fact they excluded him from the next one makes me guess it was planned and/or they didn't want him there anyway. They're the AH's imo for not being direct. Even if it was that they don't want him there or see them as their friend... Just act like an adult and be honest. It can hurt someone but spare them a lot more hurt in the future.\n\nI don't want to call OP the AH because tbh he sounds like a naive kid who's not found his people yet but is trying to make connections. (also based on him buying food to bring without it even being confirmed he's invited, sounds like he's trying to fit in). But I don't have enough info and could be wrong, he could be a huge AH which is why they didn't want him there. You never really know the full story on AITA.", "Edit: I don't see why people keep saying he invited himself. He asked. He asked if he could go. This is how people make friends. You don't ask you don't get, but those being asked should say no if the answer is no.", "But you're excusing his  behavior in favor of bashing the others based on just as little information. You're saying they are the assholes because they weren't direct? How so? They were completely direct. Cara said she was okay with him going, but it wasn't just her dinner so she had to ask the others. It is far more likely that Darren told them he was going home, so Brenda (who he admits he doesn't know very well) and Cara decide to do their own thing. They then tell him so. End of that portion of the story.   \n\n\nLater, they have a new party with more people, but don't invite him. They don't have to invite him to every dinner just because he invited himself along to the first one.  \n\n\nAnd yes, they told him there was no dinner the day before. But he only invited himself along a few days prior. That's not unreasonable.   \n\n\nAnd you're right, you never really know the full story on AITA, but you're filling in gaps for him, and ignoring facts for them.", "Because he invited himself. And no, not everyone tries to make friends by inviting themselves to something they aren't invited to. A much better way to make friends is how he started out, by inviting people to hang out with him, not inviting himself along to someone else's gathering.", "I know I'm filling in gaps, but I also think you're filling in gaps, just differently to me. This is why I enjoy reading comments on AITA to see how people interpret situations differently. \n\nI don't like people feeling left out and if someone asked me if they could join me and others, I'd think they were reaching out to make a connection and do everything to make them feel included. I'm not meaning AH in the most strictest sense of the word, they're probably a young group of friends who don't see him as a part of that group, wanted to be together for new years and didn't have the heart to tell him no. As you grow up you learn how to let people down more appropriately.", "YTA. No need to clarify. They didn\u2019t want to invite you in the first place. You asked so they felt awkward so invited you. They probably changed plans on purpose to avoid having you there. \n\nLet it go. They don\u2019t want to be friends with you.", "NTA.\nOP, you invited them over for Thanksgiving, carried out some favors for Cara, which she asked you for-judging from these circumstances, it seems you consider them to be your friend. But, while it is unfortunate, these people do not consider you to be their friend, probably just a person they can use in case of emergencies. \nAs many comments pointed it out, probably you just didn't bond well with each other. However, just because I can't vibe well with someone, doesn't mean that person doesn't have any value. \nBesides, many comments already pointed out that, Brenda probably doesn't like you, then why did she tell you about it, specifically terming it as 'New Year's dinners'? Again, according to Edgar, it wasn't Brenda who felt uncomfortable, it was Cara. Looks like Cara is the one whose trying to avoid you. Moreover, you were hurt because MOST of your classmates were invited. It wasn't a party between 3-4 close friends, it was almost the whole class. So, you have a right to be upset.\nSometimes we can't form good relationships with people, albeit it's sad, it's fine.

Bit harsh.", "Oh, I see. Your word choice makes a lot more sense now. Are any of the other people in your post Asian American?", "That's difficult to say. I had one 'Ask' parent and one 'Guess' parent, and there are benefits and drawbacks to each. 'Ask' can be abrasive/jarring. 'Guess' can be frustrating. OP should operate under the assumption than anything other than an enthusiastic \"Yes\" is going to be a firm \"No.\"\n\nAs for whether one struggles to pick up on social cues, that sounds like the kind of situation that warrants more compassion on all fronts. I don't think its necessarily fair for the burden of 'Ask' not picking up on social cues to be placed on the 'Guess' who then have to then go outside their own comfort zone to be accommodating. Nor should 'Ask' have to navigate tricky wording to get to the crux of communication with 'Guess'.\n\nI wish there was a one-size-fits-all approach to communication but we, as people, are just fickle.", "Okay, but by the time you're an adult you should definitely know that inviting yourself to something is rude as hell. I don't pick up on social cues, but I also don't invite myself to people's parties and dinners.", "Maybe. Maybe it's a cultural thing. Either way, I'd assume if someone doesn't realise they're being rude by asking to go to a party they weren't invited to, they aren't going to get the whole hinting around thing either...", "It\u2019s a perfectly appropriate usage", "Nah, respectfully have to disagree with you on this one. I'm an 'Ask' person living in a default 'Guess' country and I can tell you that the Guess environment is terrible communication, even for default Guess people. I've seen people suffer in silence because others can't, you know, read their mind when they could just politely say something, or because the words they used weren't actually the words they meant.\n\nI don't disagree with you that anything other than an enthusiastic yes should be considered a no. The fact we can't even get that firmly established for really important things like sex is telling.\n\nIf you're an autistic person who struggles to pick up on social cues, a socially anxious person who reads too much into the social cues they pick up on, or just a person from a different culture with different cultural norms, it's unfair to just label that person as rude. \n\nThe kind thing to do, the caring thing to do, is explain the situation politely.", "I'm not suggesting that inviting oneself to other people's parties is a good thing. I'm saying that people need to be clear. If someone is trying to invite themselves to your party, they may lack an awareness, or maybe consider they aren't going to pick up on subtle hints that they aren't welcome.", "Unless you are actually invited, you shouldn't assume that you're invited even if you have been in the past or even if you are friends. Just because your friends with someone doesn't mean you're going to be invited to every event, doesn't mean you'll be invited to every dinner. That's why invitations exist in the first place, to allow people to know when they are allowed to come over.\nTrying to invite yourself, no matter the circumstances is rude.", "The person I replied to suggested saying what they mean, and the responses you suggested don't fit that bill. Arguably, they could be just as ambiguous - OP could have arranged another meal and invited them all and ended up having them all decline, or approaching Brenda and have her have to say directly. I agree that your options are still better than being directly rude, but it's not what the commenter I was replying to was suggesting.", "Wow!
