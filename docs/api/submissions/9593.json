Here's some food for thought: \n\nI can see you love both your kids, but hold your daughter's choices in higher esteem because they are currently more beneficial to her and you. You \"do not like his 'career'.\" I find this talk kind of on the edge of classist because his choices aren't as \"good.\" Just because someone really really enjoys their life and they are a \"burger flipper\" doesn't mean their choices were \"bad\" or \"poor.\" They might, in the long run, realize that it's really hard to advance in that career and support themselves because of a lot of reasons, one of those being that they're usually not paid much. \n\nI think he probably deserves some heart to heart and boundaries about what he's allowed to use in the home without paying rent. He does work, by picking up dog walking and Uber gigs, so it's not like he's completely sitting and not making ANY money. \n\nMaybe a stipulation about how much he's expected to pay for the internet and food? Or perhaps sitting with him and asking about how he's planning this future for himself and how long it might take to pan out. Being transparent with him that you're concerned about his choice, as well as being loving and realistic with him will show that you still care about him and also trust him as an adult by leveling with him. \n\nIs your ultimate goal to be an empty nester? Have you talked about this with him? I bet he would appreciate being told that someone is proud of him for working toward a goal, even if that goal isn't what you imagined it to be. Maybe plan the goal together, and set expectations about what to do if he's missing the mark rather than an ultimatum. Include him in that decision and he might surprise you and say that realistically, it might take a very long time for him to complete that goal and he's willing to compromise to figure out how to get there by taking on a part time job or something. \n\nAs an alternative, have you thought about suggesting he live with a friend?", "YWNBTA.

Plus I have my own bills that I pay for the whole house.", "Not medical school, he used to talk about that before but it was just a regular college.", "So because he didn't handle it the same, he needs the ultimatum? \n\nYou do know they are two different individuals, right? Different thoughts, motivations...etc? \n\nPoint is, it's not going to come off as anything less than preferential treatment for the one who fits your ideals, while the other is clearly less worthy. \n\nContinue with your plan, at the risk of alienating him.", "OK then in my opinion, he is just doing what every other 20 year old does: trying to figure out what the hell he wants to do and who the hell he is. \n\nI think you need to have a serious conversation with him about his hobby, and maybe try talking to him about getting a more regular and sustainable job (even in retail; something that you can get a pension from.) \n\nHe is trying to find out what he wants to do and who he wants to he and probably won't figure that out until its either forced upon him or he has a eureka moment. \n\nMy gf is turning 30 this year and she has decided to go back to university because she finally knows what she wants to do. \n\nThere is a lot of pressure on young adults to know exactly what they want to do after 18; that rarely happens. \nIf he has been to therapy it might be that he is struggling with mental health issues again and the moderation gives him control, which maybe he hasn't experienced. \n\nAgain; I dont want to judge or jump to conclusions but I think a sit-down talk after looking into the subject of moderation, so you can show you have taken an interest in finding out more, might help him realise that he needs to find a more permanent job. \n\nStill; do not give him an ultimatum unless you want him to resent you. \n\nAlso, you can be supportive but also firm; just because you didn't do this stuff with your daughter doesn't mean that he gets a free pass. Rent is higher; food prices are higher; wages are the same. \n\nI think talking about rent payments etc would be a good thing also (obviously I wouldn't personally charge him the same as a landlord down the street but everyone needs to be taught about the value of money sometime.) \n\nLike I said before, although I agree with your sentiment, you're the arsehole for threatening him with homelessness because you don't approve.\n\nEdit: Treat your son and daughter the same. Despite their differences they are both equally your children, even though your son is currently making bad life decisions with his 'job' of moderating. \n\nLow rent for both but equal. He has to pay for the gas for the car etc. \nHow would you feel if your sister lived rent-free because she knew what she wanted and you have to pay because you didn't? Empathise but lay ground rules.

I doubt they\u2019re sifting through resumes for that gig.", "So then you're going to be explicitly showing favoritism and your son is going to resent you for the rest of his life.\n\nThis is the time for you to be consistent, and if you ask your daughter to pay rent then you can later go back and help her in other ways.\n\nOr make separate rules and expect strife in your life for decades to come.", "It sounds like he is still unsure. To be clear, in my opinion, his moderation is just a hobby and it will likely see no income at any point. \n\nWhen he says \"eventually\" going back to college, I believe this also means he has no idea what to do. \n\nMaybe he is lost within himself and doesn't know what he wants or who he is! \n\nI agree he needs to do more, like I said I never disagreed with the reason for your question ONLY that you threatened to make him homeless. \n\nA sit-down talk between you both is certainly the most important step for both of you; so you can both empathise with each other (he knowing financial difficulties and adult life advice, you knowing where he is coming from.) \n\nYou offered to pay his college tuition and he didn't jump at that chance? Probably unsure of himself or is not in the right place. That can be fine, as long as he commits to getting a real job that is sustainable, then moderating in his spare time? \n\nWould that be a good compromise for you both?", "Yeah but if I also asked my daughter, he will tell me he will pay once he is her age, also this would prevent my daughter from managing her money as she sees fit, as she already has some in investment accounts she cannot withdraw from without a penalty.", "True but had I set the same ultimatum for my daughter it would not have been an issue as she was in college and thus following the same rules even if they had not explicitly been set.", "Yeah I know, I have had and tried discussing all these things for a long time now, my daughter even offered to help him out study if he chose the same field as her.\n\nI probably would not actually kick him out, but it is problematic to see him spend most of the day moderating and doing gig work with my car to fund his gaming and biking hobbies.", "Was your daughter working on her education at the point where your son is at?

He will get same stuff if he does XYZ.\n\n- you are absolutely not forcing him to do anything's, he is free to build his resume or whatever. \n\n- don't charge him, just let him get his own (eg if he wants internet, he figures out his own subscription or does XYZ and in that case he gets it for free as a reward).\n\nPS: the career path is kinda questionable in terms of growth.", "It's your house.  He does not get to tell you when he will pay.  You get to tell him.", "You don\u2019t need to treat both kids the same. They are two different people with different needs and situations. Part of being a good parent is seeing them and treating them as individuals. \n\nRight now, your son is lost. He is not doing anything that will help him launch. He is not going to school, learning a trade or a skill, or even working a job. Your focus needs to be on helping him figure it out. Part of doing that is setting boundaries and expectations. \n\nYou should give him these options:\n1.) Go to school-college or trade. Learn something and have experiences that will propel him forward. \n2.) Get a full time job. Doing anything non-gig, specifically because he doesn\u2019t have the required equipment for gig work. Can be hourly or salary. But it needs to be full time. \n3.) He gets his basic needs met. 3 meals, water and shelter. Medical care. Fun money? Nope. Internet? Not unless he\u2019s paying. Real adults have real expenses.\n\nIt\u2019s not about him doing what you want. It\u2019s about him learning the skills needed to be a productive adult. Your daughter is already doing that.

I understand the hesitation with your daughter but if you're trying to motivate your son, isolating him monetarily will not help. \n\nHe is 20, and will get out of this with help. I ask if he has mental illness because he certainly in a rut (someone called ita funk earlier) so maybe while talking about the future with him, you ask him how he feels he is doing now and if he is happy currently and if so, he could do this for the foreseeable future. \n\nIt will at least give you an idea whether he is actually happy or (from the sounds of it could be the case as it sounds a lot like I was at his age) just going day to day because its the easiest and most distracting thing to do. \n\nIf he is gaming a lot, help paying for electric bill and WiFi would be good too. Remember that your daughter should pay rent also, otherwise its favouritism. \n\nOnce he starts paying his way, he will realise the jobs he has are not enough to lay for his hobbies; then he will start seriously considering other options. \n\nThrough this time though, be firm but supportive. Accepting but realistic. He will figure it out and before long he will be 27 with a sustainable job (uni or not) thanking you for being patient when he felt lost the most.

We live by a good school and she was lucky to get in so she could live at home which she did not mind doing.", "This is such good advice.  It's an extension of the \"life isn't fair\" line I used with my kids.  \n\nI have three adult children, and have helped each of them in different ways, as they needed.  One had college completely paid for.  I bailed one out of credit card debt.  I helped the third with a down payment on her house.  Different needs, different ways to help, same result - each is a self-sufficient functioning adult.", "Well OP, it honestly doesn't sound like youre going to do anyhthing, so I am going to step out and just wish you the best of luck with your son", "YWNBTA.\n\nLook. He's found something he enjoys, that challenges him. The problem is, I'm aware of the moderation work he wants to pursue, and a kid recent out of high school is going to need significantly more experience under belt before he's employable, and even then it's not *that* profitable unless you manage to bag one of the higher level FTE positions. And there aren't many. Most of them are part time or limited term, meaning it'll always be a little like gig work, and relying on influencers and start-ups (where a lot of these opportunities live) is always somewhat unstable.\n\nBut! If he wants to do that, cool beans. I don't think it's too much to ask that he shows progress toward that goal and gives you a timeline, though. For one, they'll want to see skills in communication, training, possibly tech skills - a lot of moderation also relies on an understanding of the terminology users will use so you can facilitate convos, so if he wants to moderate a particular kind of forum, some credentials will help. I think if you reframe this to him - that paid work, education, training classes, internships would all support his goal - you can support his career path while still enforcing some actual forward momentum. Telling him that he needs to show some kind of momentum to paid work or education isn't favoritism because your daughter already did that.\n\nOn the plus side? Making him try things in support of his career goal means he's entirely likely to discover over options he might like, too. Don't let him tell you unpaid moderation is enough to get him paid work. It helps, and a degree isn't required, but he'll have to show more in this day and age. He should also start applying to paid work immediately! At a quick glance, there were part time moderation jobs already available online, yeah sometimes for only an hour a day but that's paid work that can go *on a resume* and for which he'll make references. Another great option is to look into any media-based social media work that might seem low hanging now but will build that brand as a facilitator and enforcer.\n\nIt's not assholeish to ask that he gets serious about his future when he's still driving your car. And you can do that and still support his career path.", "YTA.  A soft one but still TA.\n\nI was going to post something along the lines of food and shelter but I was beaten to it.  But I'm going to suggest the same thing.\n\nWhat will kicking him out achieve?  It will do some damage to your relationship probably because you are not holding your daughter to the same standard.  She has a job but can live everything free because you are paying for it all.  Because he hasn't got a job then he can't live everything free because you don't like it.\n\nYou can actually hold your daughter to the same standard as your son.  You are providing food and shelter only.  Anything extra they need to pay for.  I hope your daughter is paying for her own phone as well all as clothes and entertainment.  Your son can do the same thing... if he wants better stuff or more stuff... then he needs to get a proper paying job.  If he doesn't, he can't do anything.  That's life.  The main costs when moving out are your rent, food and utilities and you'd still be providing the bulk of that.  Treats in regards to foods can just not be bought for a while (or hidden so others can't access it).\n\nIf you don't want to hold your kids to the same standard then that's your choice.  But you run the risk of losing your relationship with one of them if you kick your son out based on this.", "NTA, \u201cjob with income\u201d is not a \u201ccareer path,\u201d it\u2019s the literal definition of having a job. If you desperately want your son to change his lifestyle while your daughter still pays no rent, I\u2019d suggest the following: \u201cIt is important to me that you both are taking concrete steps towards financial independence. I will be charging for rent and utilities from now on. If you want to avoid this charge, you can by 1) having a full-time paying job, 2) going to school full time, or 3) having a part-time paying job and going to school part-time. What you do in your free time aside from that is up to you.\u201d This way it\u2019s not technically favoring your daughter because she will face the same consequences if she for whatever reason decides to quit her job. And you\u2019re not telling your son he has to quit his mod position, if he ends up balancing it with his \u201creal\u201d job, that\u2019s fine. Also I think you should count gig work as work but only the hours he does it. Like if he does gig work 40 hours per week that would count as a full-time job.", "\u201cI want to give my son an ultimatum which will force him to do what I want\u201d\n\nSolid ESH for that.", "Call it board then.  There's no tax on that seeing as it's just going to expenses like food and utilities.", "Tell him a lot of college students don\u2019t know what they want to do. Encourage him to study what he\u2019s interested in. That\u2019s better than no degree.", "I think that a paid moderation gig on social media is even more of a unicorn than the full ride sports scholarship leading to a pro career.
