My parents have the master bedroom, my brother (23M) used to have the second largest room and me, being the youngest, had the small bedroom for most of my life. When my brother got married, he and his wife got their own place. They were renting and are now building their own house, but that won\u2019t be ready til next year, so to save up for the construction they temporarily moved back in.\n\nThe thing is, I moved my things to the larger room that used to be his once he left home. There\u2019s more space for my stuff and I\u2019m settled there. Now that he\u2019s back he asked me to return to my old room. I said I would not. He says I should understand they are two people and I\u2019m only one, so they need the extra space more than I do, and also he had that room for years. I said tough luck.\n\nHe even tried to get our parents involved, since it\u2019s their house, but my father said he wouldn\u2019t get in the middle of this and that we should work things out between ourselves. My brother did get to my mother, however! She didn\u2019t ask me to vacate the room, but said I should be more understanding of my brother. My SIL is also pissed at me; she didn\u2019t say anything but I can tell for the way she acts.

He still thinks of that room as his room but the minute he moved out and got married any claim he had was forfeited. That's how it is in most parental homes.

You probably heard your whole life that he got the bigger room because he was older.\n\nNow he was all moved out - it was your turn to have the bigger room.

But I don't think it's an unreasonable request to ask for the bigger room for 2 people...temporarily. \n\n>I said tough luck.\n\nWhy do people treat their loved ones like this? If you had a list of reasons the smaller room won't work, let's hear them. But to simply say \"I've moved in now, tough luck to you and your wife\" just seems uncaring to me.

This must be super fun for his wife, too. \n\nI can see why the brother feels like they need more room but holy entitlement, Batman.  Why isn\u2019t big brother offering something to make little sib feel seen and respected? It looks like big bro just thinks he can have whatever he wants.

Not a lot, let them genuinely save money by living at home for a while, but enough that you get some good out of it and they are incentivized to get out of there with all due speed.", "NTA stand your ground. He has no right to demand this of you.

Don't let them push you. Their situation is only temporary, you shouldn't have to move your stuff, and then have to do it again when they leave. No doubt most of their things are in storage anyway so they don't need the room.", "NTA, cheeky little fella didn't realize that once you move out, there's no coming home as it was, it's now a new home with diff rules than the past.

For several reasons\u2026 it\u2019s temporary so why do all the extra moving, it\u2019s temporary so why take from one kid for the other, it\u2019s temporary and I can tell you, while ot sucks, I\u2019ve shared a room with my hubby and 4 kids for a few months, even shared a living room with the kids and hubby for 2 months at one point\u2026. It\u2019s tight but doable and if I can with my family of 6, and claustrophobia, ops brother can with two adults\u2026 \n\nAlso, giving the higher room kinda says \u2018we\u2019re comfortable, so if it takes longer to build oh well\u2019  with little to no incentive to keep on top and make sure things are going smoothly \n\n\nThese are just a few reasons I can think of but it all boils down to temporary\u2026.

From what you describe the smaller room doesn't really seem to fit two adults. It's one of those \"oh so that's how you want our relationship to be?\"-moments people really hold on to. If you can't show some compassion while they have to live with their parents as newlyweds then why should they throw you a bone later down the line?\n\nEdit: that \"tough luck\" comment is basically my entire point.\n\nFor the next 7 months you'll be the a-hole living in room fit for two people and your brother and SIL will be living in a room fit for one person. There's no reasonable explanation (so far) for you to stay in the bigger room. \n\nWeird energy for your parents not be the adults in this situation and tell you to shut up and stop being selfish.", "Unpopular but YTA and I will explain with a question: How would you feel in this exact scenario if you were in his shoes? Imagine if you lived in this house for years, having your own room, then moved out with your gf, needed for a while to move back in and your teen brother who got your room refusing to move back to his own room to help make things more bearable, thus forcing two grown ups to live in the smallest room and be uncomfortable for months, even though for him it would be just a minor incovenience at best for a couple of months, since he lived in the smallest room for all these years without any issues. How would that make you feel? \n\nNobody can force you to do anything, but you are certainly being unkind towards your brother, moving your stuff for some months to the other room can be done in a weekend and is barely an inconveniece for you, while he and his gf will be very uncomfortable.\n\nRemember that kindness is a two way street, you may need your brother's one day, hopefully he will not reciprocate the kindness you show him today.\n\nFinally, I have a gut feeling that you don't really like your brother all that much, can't help but wonder why, whether something did happen between you two.", "NTA.  He can have the bigger room if he pays you for it.", "I would say mild YTA. \nIt's your brother not some stranger and it's two people in a tiny area you could be nice to your brother and this are the type of things that differentiate good from bad relationships growing up. \nYo do not have at all to give up the room, he moved out and your parents are doing him a favour but you could be nice, maybe switch it up... Not doing doesn't make you an asshole, how you managed and said tough luck just cause you couldn't be arsed to be nice does make you a lil AH.", "INFO\n\nDid you ask your parents for permission to change rooms, or did you just take unilateral action?

Nice move. I applaud you sticking to your guns.", "Parents are doing him a huge favour by letting him stay there and he's having a hissy fit about not getting his old room back. Are you sure he's 23 and not 13? The entitlement of people these days. NTA and stand your ground. Also consider getting a lock so he can't do the old stuff switcheroo when you're out.", "YTA\n\nYou are being very shortsighted about how you will negatively impact your relationship 1, 2, even 10 years from now.\n\nYou basically indicated that your old room was barely big enough for you and you expect it to be big enough for 2 dressers, a bed large enough for 2 adults to sleep in, and closet space for 2 people.  Clearly your old room isn't a valid option for your brother and his wife.\n\nThere are consequences to what you are doing.  The majority of posters in here never bother looking further than the end of their nose to see what happens in the future. Your brother is older and more established financially and very capable of helping you in times of need and its very likely that someday you may find yourself needing his help.  Unfortunately, you intend to burn a bridge right now and someday you will realize that people don't make much of an effort to help family they dislike.\n\nYou enduring a small bit of discomfort for a short amount of time to help them avoid a huge amount of discomfort over that same time and that small sacrifice of yours will go a long ways to creating a bond that you may leverage for help. Being nice leaves an impression, being shitty leaves a much bigger impression that people rarely forget.", "Idk I got made to move out of my room frequently as a kid/teen for house guests. I gave my room to an exchange student and slept on my brother\u2019s bunk bed.

Note that there are other options they want to go cheap and have it all. \n\nTel them both they need to shut up and stop pouting because it is not happening and toddler behavior like I\u2019m gonna tell mom is going to make this living arrangement most disagreeable.

But ask yourself this, do you really need the bigger room? Or do you just want the room because it's bigger?\n\nFrom what I've read it seemed the latter.\n\nHere's the thing, your brother need the bigger room.\nThere is 2 of them and I assume they need space for their stuffs. Your SIL is a woman. So that means they need more space for her stuffs more than you need the space for your stuff. Trust me, she will need more space than your little room can store.\n\nAnd yes, you've claimed the room when he left. But just because he left, doesn't meant your parents house stops being his house.

I would say, yes you should have the biggest room if the other rooms aren't fit for two people. But, it's my bedroom and I already spent too much time having less space.

My parents have the master bedroom, my brother (23M) used to have the second largest room and me, being the youngest, had the small bedroom for most of my life. When my brother got married, he and his wife got their own place. They were renting and are now building their own house, but that won\u2019t be ready til next year, so to save up for the construction they temporarily moved back in.\n\nThe thing is, I moved my things to the larger room that used to be his once he left home. There\u2019s more space for my stuff and I\u2019m settled there. Now that he\u2019s back he asked me to return to my old room. I said I would not. He says I should understand they are two people and I\u2019m only one, so they need the extra space more than I do, and also he had that room for years. I said tough luck.\n\nHe even tried to get our parents involved, since it\u2019s their house, but my father said he wouldn\u2019t get in the middle of this and that we should work things out between ourselves. My brother did get to my mother, however! She didn\u2019t ask me to vacate the room, but said I should be more understanding of my brother. My SIL is also pissed at me; she didn\u2019t say anything but I can tell for the way she acts. So, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are going to live with them for atleast another year. And deal with them (to some extent) for rest of your life. Not sure if he's maybe the type of guy to hold it against you for rest of life.
