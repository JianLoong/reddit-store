Is she spending time with the little girls because they are her sisters and she likes playing with them, or because her household chore is entertaining the little ones?\n\nSiblings spend time together. Yes, even ones with 10+ year age gaps. That's not a chore - that's siblings spending family time together.\n\nIf you tell her she can't go out with her friends, because she has to stay home with the kids while you go out for date night or something, then it becomes a chore.\n\nSo I don't know how to judge your post, because I'm completely confused about how much your stepdaughter wants to spend time with her little sisters.\n\nBut probably NTA", "Something doesn\u2019t add up here.

It sounds like you were only actually asking her to babysit for infrequent short times. Helping younger siblings with getting a snack is completely normal sibling behavior, that\u2019s not babysitting. And it sounds like she was completely fine with that role. Your husband probably needs to talk to his daughter and actually listen to her.", "It seems like your husband has heard about 'paentification,' and has decided that this is what's happening.

I'm trying to not leave them alone together and intervene when they ask her for something, though usually if they ask her something when he's not home she'll just engage with them a little bit/verbally praise but say she's busy or something. But if her dad is home she will be very passive aggressive like he'll say \"hmm you know who would love to watch you do that is Daddy, why don't you go get him,\" knowing full well her dad is napping or something. She tries to do it in a way that they don't catch on, and I (and my husband) try to intervene so it doesn't come up even, but the girls are starting to notice which is hard. I told my husband this but of course his attitude is that it's for the best and in her best interests, even if no one is happy but him.\n\nShe and I haven't had a long 1:1 conversation but the house is small enough for her to know that even though it was framed as a \"we\" decision, she knows I'm not really in agreement with it.", "Sometimes I will say oh I forgot something can you watch them for 20 minutes here's $10 or here's my cc you can order takeout while I'm gone. But yes much more of the babysitting is when we're all at home, things like I'm in the next room. I wouldn't call it hanging out because if she's in the room and I'm not, she's in charge/responsible for them and we all know it, if they ask for food she'll say, no you can't have that or help get them something or say yes but it has to be veggies, she doesn't just yell for me to come make them food.

And it's not like I expected childcare help of her from the start, she's the one who initiated it and does more of it as she gets older, if she wanted to avoid it she could, she could just say go ask your mom or go to her room. \n\nBut my husband's feeling is that regardless of her personal preference, this isn't in her best interests, because he feels like she has too much responsibility at her mom's (and I agree) so this is sort of supposed to be her vacation and not something where she should be falling into the same pattern.", "There was no specific incident but she only got here on the 5th and he started this conversation on the 9th, he specifically mentioned to me when we argued that it also bothered him when she was here for spring break too but that was only a week so he didn't bring it up then. But that's why he's bringing it up now, because she's here now. It's been a normal pattern of behavior for a few years at this point, probably escalating because she's getting older and more capable.", "I also feel that lots of details are missing.", "She was fine with the previous arrangement.", "It seems like the girl dosent really have options just like others said its babysitting or doing nothing for 60 days.\nI agree with others that the mother is taking slight advanteg of her SD", "If your stepdaughter is watching your kids, she needs to be compensated. If you aren't, I can totally see why your husband may feel like she's being taken advantage of. If she watches your kids, compensate her.

Maybe you should ask her how she feels about it. That\u2019s totally normal sibling interaction to ask an older sibling to help with something. He\u2019s causing a divide between the siblings which is not good. Maybe she\u2019s feeling like dad says I\u2019m not allowed to be close to you guys??? So she makes the passive aggressive comments. And also if that\u2019s the case and dad is sleeping and he\u2019s the one who put the restrictions then they should wake him.", "I may sound crazy but it sounds like she doesn't want to watch her younger siblings and your not catching the hints", "You tell her she can order take out when you will be gone for 20 minutes?  That doesn\u2019t sound right and I gotta wonder if it\u2019s really 20 minutes.", "Here\u2019s the thing, if she is getting parentified and having too much responsibility at her Mom\u2019s, she may be unconsciously jumping into that role at your place as well. If she\u2019s spending her whole life feeling like she\u2019s supposed to take care of everyone else, she may need to be actively encouraged to not to that and take a break. And you\u2019re not doing that.\n\nESH. Your husband\u2019s approach is too aggressive, but you\u2019re also taking advantage and putting your convenience over what your stepdaughter really needs.\n\nThe informal way you\u2019re doing this sounds particularly bad because it sounds like she\u2019s basically always on call. She needs to take time to just be a kid and do her own thing.", "What I still don't understand is if you're under the belief that she doesn't *have* to help you, why are you arguing with your husband over this decision? I get it that the daughter is annoyed but ultimately if he thinks not putting this responsibility on her is in her best interest and isn't actually banning her from spending quality time with her siblings otherwise, why is that an issue for you? Kids are annoyed at all kinds of rules that parents inflict for their best interest. Why are *you* bothered by it?", "It sounds like your husband needs to address his concerns with his daughter and get her input. I can appreciate he doesn't want her to feel like she's being used as a babysitter because you manage to watch your children without assistance when she's not at your home.", "According to you.", "It doesn't seem like lack of compensation is the issue. The real problem is that  this girl is lonely and stuck in the house because she doesn't know anyone in her dad's area. She's not there enough to have friends.\n\nDad and OP have to help daughter make connections.  Maybe they enroll her in a sports or music program, maybe they throw regular bbqs and invite families with teens so daughter can meet people.\n\nPretty ridiculous of him to ban her doing things with her siblings out of fear of \"parentification\". She is probably willingly helping out from boredom and because she's a good helpful person.", ">If she watches your kids, compensate her. Even if you're in the next room, she is still helping you.\n\nI'm sorry, but that's ridiculous. Babysitting is watching over and being responsible for kids when their parents are physically out of the house and therefore need a guardian to make sure nothing happens to them. The stepdaughter hanging out with her younger siblings while the parents are briefly in another room isn't babysitting, it's her hanging out in the same house as younger siblings, who happen to be in the same room. You don't need a babysitter for your kids when you're in a different room, so OP doesn't need the stepdaughter to be responsible when she's literally only a few feet away from her kods.", "It's not that (though he doesn't want her to be babysitting while I'm not home either) it's more general role when we're all home, the way it's been in the past is that if I'm not in the vicinity and she is, she is in charge. If they need something she will usually handle on her own rather than going to get me. If they ask her for something like a snack she will say no it's too close to dinner/okay sure what do you want/yes but only veggies let's cut some up for everyone or whatever is appropriate. And of course if she's out of the house with them she's also very much an authority figure too.", "Offended is a good word for it because yes when he told her she was visibly upset but she didn't say \"come on please please please let me babysit for you\" or beg him to change his mind because she's aware she's doing something helpful, and if he doesn't want that it's sort of his problem. But she's definitely not happy, we've had enough conversations to know that.", "She is openly upset at her dad telling her she can't anymore.", "Yeah I mean it's basically her reward, that's just an example and by takeout I mean things like snack/lunch delivery not dinner for the entire family. Or if it is dinner time that's something we'd have discussed beforehand and it's somewhere she'd have been asking for or only she likes so it's only one portion being ordered. And sometimes it's more like me asking her if she wants me to pick up starbucks for her on the way back or whatever is on the way of the errand I'm already running, like we're out of diapers do you want me to get anything for you while I'm there.", "I have to disagree.  It doesn't sound like she's being parentified at all or even feels that she's expected to take care of all the kids.  Is it helpful to have her stepdaughter there?  Of course, it's always helpful to have another set of capable hands, but OP isn't asking her stepdaughter to relieve her of her responsibilities.  As an oldest sibling, I can tell you there are just some things that come with the territory.  One SAHP cannot physically watch and be present for three children every second of the day.  Mom needs to use the bathroom, throw a load of laundry in, change a baby, get dinner started?  Older kids keep an eye on the younger kids for a few minutes. That doesn't mean they're being parentified - it's just what has to happen sometimes.  Younger kids need help with something when they're in the same room as the older kids?  Older kids help them out if they're able to.  There's absolutely nothing about this situation that sounds different from every other household with multiple kids.", "this! i\u2019m glad you asked so i didn\u2019t have to.", "That's just being an older sibling.  That's not really parentifying or even baby sitting.", "Sounds more like she's just a nice big sister.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case I think you are home and available she shouldn\u2019t have to spend all her time with the little kids. That\u2019s kind of a waste of dad\u2018s time with her.\n\nThe way you\u2019re telling it it sounds like she\u2019s with either one or some of the kids while you do other things. That should be her time. InDo you tell her look I\u2019m gonna go take a nap or I\u2019m gonna put the baby down or whatever you need to watch the other kids shouldn\u2019t be the case.\n\nShe\u2019s at the age where she needs to become herself and have her own needs to be able to do what she wants and not have to stay with the other kids while you do whatever it is you want to do. You\u2019re home all day those are your kids why should she have to spend the whole day with these little kids?  \n\nMaybe dad needs to start putting some time away for just her. Taking her out to dinner taking her for walks arranging things for her to do during the summer. My granddaughter has to spend one month in the summer with her mom and stepsis and has to always entertaining her. Noh she can\u2019t say anything but she\u2019s bored they live out in the middle of nowhere she\u2019s 14 and that\u2019s not how she wants to spend her life taking care of the other kids or even just having to spend every second with them. \n\nCan she play video games can she go for walks or does she have to stay with the kids. Can she get a bike and go bike riding, go to the library there\u2019s a lot of things she could be doing other than watching your kids. Whether you wanna believe it or not babysitting is even if you expect her to keep the other kids occupied while you do other things that\u2019s babysitting.", "So why doesn\u2019t she get any time to herself. Why does all her time have to be spent with the step kids? Why haven\u2019t you or your husband made plans for something she wants to do? There\u2019s nothing wrong with helping out but when it\u2019s expected and that\u2019s her whole life then that is a problem", "I didn\u2019t say what OP is doing is parentification\u2014 I\u2019m saying that if she is being parentified at her mother\u2019s house, she may not have any idea how to set boundaries on her time at OP\u2019s. OP admits she is expected to do too much babysitting and chores at her mother\u2019s and that\u2019s why her father is concerned about that continuing.", "Exactly.  I'm really confused because these are just everyday interactions between siblings.  My 9 year-old niece will get her little brother some water or help him get a snack from the pantry, but that's not babysitting, it's just life with younger siblings, and it's something she can do for him that means he doesn't end up having to wait 5 or 10 minutes for an adult to do it for him.  Is your husband trying to make your life more difficult by ensuring that all the kids bug you and only you every single time they need something basic?  She's not being left alone with them in an official babysitting capacity, and if you try to take away these types of interactions, you might as well just tell her you want her to stop spending any time with the children.", "This is what I was thinking."]}
