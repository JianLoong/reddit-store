A couple days ago she told me she was going for a trip with two friends for two days since she has days off work and I didn't like it. The thing is that she never wants to go out to have lunch or make a picnic or things like that, she always wants to stay home because she is cold or she doesn't have money (I pay for everything always) or doesn't feel like it. Recently she got a job and since she is just working and I'm studying, working and working as an apprentice she earned double what I make. Since she got her salary she's been going out for lunch, going out to party or now going on a trip but she hasn't included me in any of these things. A couple of weeks ago even, I invited her to go grab some lunch but she just refused and told me she didn't want to, so I went by myself and for my surprise she appeared with his male best friend in the same restaurant to have lunch with him, when I asked her how comes she didn't tell me that she didn't want to go with me because she already had plans she said that she just forgot to do it. Then after that she told me she was going out with her 16 yo sister for her first party but then I found out that she in fact went with her friends. This last month I've seen how she hides things from me, how she is up to go out with everyone except for me and how she doesn't plans on inviting me to anything, I have to be the one in charge of paying everything and giving her presents even if she is currently earning double what I do. After all this she told me she bought a ticket to go on a trip now that she has two days off and it passed me off, because she is willing to make all these things and spend money with other people but not with me. Must say before ending this that she mistreated me two days before telling me about the trip because as she says \"she misses me and is upset for not being able to be together as much\" but then goes and uses her days off to go on a trip and not spend time with me. I think I have reasons to be mad but what do you think, AITA?
