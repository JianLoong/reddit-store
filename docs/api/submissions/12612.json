Very much NTA, especially since she had her phone and your bus pass and you dropped her off right at the bus stop. Maybe now she'll realize that she isn't a competent authority on driving.", "NTA.

Depending on others means trusting their competency and not eroding their good will. \n\nThough would note assuming that she wasn't used to being a passenger and almost always drives, being in the passenger seat does give a very different perspective on how close car is to verges in UK and assume oncoming traffic in US. She may not have done that mental adjustment. I struggle sometimes but I accepted the ride so need to either trust the driver or be asked to be dropped off. My Dad is very bad and grabbed my wheel twice. Clean licence 30 years and he still holds the door handle.

If she had grabbed at the steering wheel, you would not be at fault because that is entirely unacceptable. She's definitely the worst party here.\n\nHowever, you seem unsure if she was reaching and you mention it a few times. If she had actually touched it, then you would be well justified to dump her without a warning. However, again, you were unsure, so there's a chance you dropped her off for just annoyingly telling you instructions, and that...that's not really cool, and although I wouldn't personally begrudge you for it.\n\nOnto your wife's comment, I think she has the right of it. Since her reaching apparently happened a few times and you weren't sure of any times, you should have said after the first time you saw something: \"If I see you reach for the steering wheel again, I am dropping you off at a bus stop.\" Maybe she was innocent of it. Maybe she would stop. And maybe you still would dumped her off, but at least you had made it clear. And on this part specifically:\n\n> She thought I should have warned her before dumping her at the bus stop, but thought that my sister might have eventually grabbed the steering wheel.\n\nThe fact that you think she reached more than once and you didn't say something like that the first time is 1) on you and 2) makes me question how serious you are on the \"eventually grabbed\" part.\n\nClearly communicate consequences.
