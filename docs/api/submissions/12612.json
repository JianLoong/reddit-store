I did not leave her at a bus stop, because she was an old lady, by herself. I hate driving in large cities. Most of my driving is done in a city of approximately 80k people or on rural roads, by myself. I drove my mother to Minneapolis to help with my sister after surgery. Evening rush hour. Never driven in the area of the hospital. Mom had been talking for over 2 hours, just to hear herself talk. I turned my radio on low about 100 miles back to try to lessen the stress of her talking. Asking her to stop didn't help. About the time we hit Minneapolis, she started complaining about my music. I had it set to an easy listening station. She tried to change the station. I told her no. She started talking about stuff that she did as a kid. I asked her to stop talking at me when I was in heavy traffic. Then she started asking questions about everything under the sun. Again, I asked her to stop talking. Then she started telling me that I was going the wrong way. She had never been there, didn't have the directions, so had no valid reason to even comment on the direction at all. Then she tried to tell me it was ok to change lanes, when I could see a car coming up fast in the lane I wanted to change to. Finally, I had come to the end of my rope and yelled \"shut the f\\*\\*k up. She was quiet for about 15 minutes and started all over again. Fortunately, when we got to the hospital, my sister could see that I was ready to go ballistic and entertained our mom for a couple hours and sent me to the cafeteria to just chill out.

He insisted that I drive us home from a place that was three and a half hours away, and involved going through a big city. He nagged and whined the whole way back, but refused to take over the driving. Then I got off the highway because I was getting scared of the traffic, and he really went to town about how badly I was driving (he had had three accidents by this time. I've never had one). I stopped the car in the middle of a major street in downtown Oshawa, looked him dead in the eye, and said, \"Get out.\" \n\n\"What?\" he asked. \n\n\"Get OOOOUUUT!!!\" I screamed. \n\nHe got out of the car, probably afraid my head was about to start spinning.

When I talked to my wife about it, she was certain that she was reaching for the steering wheel.  I think I should have given her one last warning at the bus stop.  I just didn't think of it.", "You put it in park?", "My father and brother backseat drove so much that I had several small accidents from anxiety (which they then saw as prove of my being an unfit driver). I told my mom one more comment and I'll take a bus to the T\u00dcV and give my license back. She made sure they didn't sit when I was driving for quite some time. Since I overcame that anxiety (in big parts thanks to my mom) I had exactly one accident (which broke my accident free spell at 10 years but didn't increase my insurance because they just wanted to drop it down for good driving so I lucked out) was when a hospital released me too early, having treated the surgery, oxygen and antibiotic IV needing parts of peritonitis, pneumonia and pleural effusion, forgotten to tell me I have asthma (when I was delivered in 10 months later with severe breathing issues the doctor was like \"It's allright, just your asthma acting up\" and I was like \"what asthma?\" They had told me to get an inhaler for possible allergic asthma and completely forgot to tell me I have asthma but put it in my chart. After they put me on medication and I slept off the exhaustion of weeks without breathing right it took me several months of training to regain the physical fitness lost and that wasn't more than \"walk several miles including uphill\" because I'm disabled) and missed kidney infarction (which I got from them missing the peritonitis until I already went into beginning organ shutdown) and mono. I had to drive myself to my GP for the follow up treatment and scraped a narrow corner on the entrance to the parking lot. That corner was all colours of car paint and has since been widened because it was so tight. \n\nOn the other hand I now annoy my mom with backseat driving. She developed a horrible habit of shifting gears late (even though she taught me to shift early and what sound and vibration signals my car gives me when it's time to change to a higher and lower gear) and I can't stand hearing my car being two gears too low (she recently got rid of her car because it was too expensive to fix and when we're together she almost always drives because that's usually when I'm too ill to drive). \n\nMy second worst backseat driver was my former best friend. She likes speeding and her father drives like a maniac (her mom drives perfectly fine though). She got her license five years after we met and continually scolded me for keeping traffic laws and driving too soft (I went from anxious driving to safe but careful driving to driving so that my friend that's afraid of it and her toddler feel comfortable and are safe within the first year of having my license and never changed from that, my dog is very grateful). Well driving like crazy doesn't bring me faster to my goal and prefer to spend my money on stuff I like than on traffic tickets. Well she kept her word until she drove 130kmh in a 70 zone and I (for the hundredth time but apparently the first she listened) that being in the probation period this will cost her her license if she gets caught. Then she studied the infraction rules for probation and kept her speeding within the range that doesn't cost her her license.", "I have a 2 strikes rule.\n\nYou backseat drive when I'm driving?\n\nYou get a shut the fuck up warning.\n\nThe next time?

Dad sliced his finger open with some nippers while working in the yard...after Mom and I both told him he needed to move his finger (a la \"I know what I'm doing\" - \"No, really, you don't\").  Mom got an old bath towel and wrapped it around his hand while I ran to grab the car keys so she could drive him 35 miles to the hospital.  Mom said \"Oh, no, it's your turn.  I've been doing this for nearly 20 years and you're finally old enough to enjoy the experience.  Don't worry, if you can drive through this, you can handle anything.\"  I swear, I heard the Dead March as I trudged out the front door behind my father.\n\nHe sat in the front passenger seat, holding up his newspaper, reading while criticizing everything I did.

You can walk the rest of the way to the hospital.  Call Mom when you get there and maybe she'll be nice enough to come pick you up.\"\n\nHe mumbled something under his breath.  \"What was that?\" I shouted while hitting the brake, downshifting, hitting the turn signal and pulling over simultaneously.
