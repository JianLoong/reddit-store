I've kicked people out of my car for less bullshit than that.  Going for the steering wheel should be an instant ejection.", "NTA, she reached for your steering wheel. That's crazy and dangerous.  Anyone that's mad at you, can drive her around to see for themselves what a nightmare backseat driver she is. Plus, it's not like she was completely abandoned on the side of the road. You just gave her another option. Considering she was badgering your driving skills.", "Oh boy, this is a good one. I imagined doing this to my own sister while reading your tale. \ud83d\ude05\n\nI'll probably get downvoted for this, but I'm going with NTA, largely because this is something I wish I would have done before.", "NTA, assuming that she definitely did reach for the steering wheel multiple times. If she'd just been verbally annoying, I would say that you should've given her a warning first, but I don't trust the impulse control of someone who lost their license due to reckless driving to stop trying to grab the wheel, even after being told to knock it off.\n\nEdit: I saw in your comments that you did tell her to stop several times (though you didn't threaten her with getting kicked out of the car - but again, she was behaving recklessly... which shows that she still hasn't learned her lesson). Very much NTA, especially since she had her phone and your bus pass and you dropped her off right at the bus stop. Maybe now she'll realize that she isn't a competent authority on driving.", "NTA. She has a nerve being a difficult passenger if she lost her own license. One would have thought asking her to stop would be sufficient to make her stop.", "NTA, maybe should have given a warning first but yeah otherwise NTA", "NTA. Did you warn her?", "NTA. She had it coming.", "NTA-she was being dangerous for one thing. Plus, I can't imagine doing that to someone who was just doing a favor.", "NTA. I'm taking my time to drive you around because your dumbass messed up and lost your driving privileges and you're gonna act like that? Congratulations on your promotion to pedestrian, cause I got better things to do with my time.", "I wasn\u2019t there, and don\u2019t know how distracting it was, so I\u2019m not going to say whether/not you should have given her a warning regarding backseat driving. But grabbing at the wheel? No. She\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t shove her out on the side of the road. NTA.", "NTA. She was endangering you and a salutory lesson on what it means to depend on others. Depending on others means trusting their competency and not eroding their good will. \n\nThough would note assuming that she wasn't used to being a passenger and almost always drives, being in the passenger seat does give a very different perspective on how close car is to verges in UK and assume oncoming traffic in US. She may not have done that mental adjustment. I struggle sometimes but I accepted the ride so need to either trust the driver or be asked to be dropped off. My Dad is very bad and grabbed my wheel twice. Clean licence 30 years and he still holds the door handle. He's crashed five cars (mainly as young adult) but gets upset if we comment on his driving.", "NTA. You did great. You're an inspiration to the rest of us! \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYou asked her not to several times and reaching for the wheel is terrifying. You're the one driving, in an area you know well. It is your responsibility to keep yourself and others safe and by getting her out, I think you did that. \n\nHopefully she learned her lesson", "NTA\n\nBut be warned: Assertivity is a great but dangerous tool.\n\nMany people are right ... and lonely.", "Personally I would have told her to shutt the fuck up first and given her a warning.  But, what you did is ok too. NTA.", "NTA She's lucky you didn't call the cops.", "She sounds like a joker, sorry you had to drive her. If she had grabbed at the steering wheel, you would not be at fault because that is entirely unacceptable. She's definitely the worst party here.\n\nHowever, you seem unsure if she was reaching and you mention it a few times. If she had actually touched it, then you would be well justified to dump her without a warning. However, again, you were unsure, so there's a chance you dropped her off for just annoyingly telling you instructions, and that...that's not really cool, and although I wouldn't personally begrudge you for it.\n\nOnto your wife's comment, I think she has the right of it. Since her reaching apparently happened a few times and you weren't sure of any times, you should have said after the first time you saw something: \"If I see you reach for the steering wheel again, I am dropping you off at a bus stop.\" Maybe she was innocent of it. Maybe she would stop. And maybe you still would dumped her off, but at least you had made it clear. And on this part specifically:\n\n> She thought I should have warned her before dumping her at the bus stop, but thought that my sister might have eventually grabbed the steering wheel.\n\nThe fact that you think she reached more than once and you didn't say something like that the first time is 1) on you and 2) makes me question how serious you are on the \"eventually grabbed\" part.\n\nClearly communicate consequences. You're not a big AH, but I think you could have handled this better, from both a social side and a safety side. ESH.", "ESH", "Info: What time of day did you drop her off at the bus stop?", "If you were genuinely worried about her grabbing the wheel why didn\u2019t you pull over and ask her to sit in the backseat instead ?

She probably checked it and found a different bus to get her home.", "What?? You thought your sister would intentionally wreck the car because you didn\u2019t listen to her? You then punished her for moving her hand in your direction and dumped her at a bus stop where she didn\u2019t know how to get home?
