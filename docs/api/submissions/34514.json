Two years ago my sister got married and my parents moved into her bedroom and I was given the living room where they used to live. \n\nA few days ago, her husband called me out of the blue and asked where my sister was. No one had informed me of anything, so I said I didn't know. My sister's husband asked if I was sure. Then he called me another half an hour later and asked if my sister had shown up. I was concerned and asked what was wrong. He didn't answer me anything. I started calling my sister, but she didn't answer the phone. My parents were at work and did not answer my calls either. \n\nIn the evening, when my parents came home from work, they were very angry with me.

I didn't know my sister was having an affair, I hadn't been told about it, and I didn't know what I was supposed to tell her husband. My parents said I was a traitor. They said that my sister had a fight with her husband because of me and that if they divorced, I would move back into the kitchen. \n\nMy dad doesn't talk to me but loudly tells my mom so I can hear that he is disappointed in me, that I should have known to give the right answer to my sister's husband, that I didn't defend my sister, that I am a bad brother and man and that I did it to get back at my sister because she used to sleep in the bedroom and I in the kitchen. \n\nI don't know how to convince my parents that I really didn't know what I was supposed to say. \n\nAlso my mom said that I will have to call my sister's husband and tell him that I lied and my sister was with me and then I will have to ask my sister to forgive me and only if she forgives me my parents will forgive me.", "created_utc": 1704619226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190od3a/aita_for_not_lying_to_my_sisters_husband/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You absolutely should not have lied but I understand you're in a very difficult situation with probably nowhere to go. \n\nI grew up in Eastern Europe / I'm in the UK now / so I know how hard life can be there. Your parents clearly favour your sister. We had a 3 room flat, 2 bedrooms and the living room, and 3 of us siblings / 2 girls + 1 boy / shared one room. \n\nAre you going to university after school? Hopefully if you are then at least you could move into student housing.", "NTA. Never mind their twisted morality, how were you to know to lie? Or what to lie? Should you say, She was here she's just gone, or Yes, but she's in the bathroom? Or what? You didn't know which lie to use, you cannot be blamed in any way.", "NTA. Your sister was doing the stupid behind her husband's back and got caught. You should never have to lie to cover your cheating sister. Shame on your sister and parents for defending stupid instead of coming clean.\n\nHopefully, you can move out of the apartment as soon as you turn 18.", ">my sister had sent a text message to her husband that she would be with me all day\n\nThen it's her fault, for not sending you a similar text message. You didn't even have the opportunity to lie, because SHE messed up (firstly by cheating on her husband, secondly for failing to line up an alibi).", "Damn your family is a bunch of bad people. NTA", "Fuck no if you need to lie your covering someones ass", "Your parents are insane. WTF!", "NTA and for your own mental health and personal safety, GTF outta there as soon as you realistically can and don\u2019t look back. The abuse you are experiencing will only end when you leave them all to their own devices.", "NTA. Your parents should have let you share a room with your sister. And the \"apologize to your sister and then we'll forgive you\" part is awful. It's manipulative. \n\nYou're not a traitor, you care about your sister.", "NTA but your parents and your sister are.  If they expect you to lie for her,  they should have told you.", "How is your sister being a cheating wife your fault? Whenever I hear stories like this I think \u2018follow the money\u2019. \n\nThe only way the parents would be accepting the affair is if they were getting a cash handout from your BIL and realise if they don\u2019t fix the situation, the money will stop. Or they\u2019ve realised that SIL has to move back in and your parents will have to support her. \n\nEither way, none of this is your fault. NTA.", "NTA. If they gave you some sort of warning and asked you to say she was with you I could understand their reaction slightly. But for your sister to be using you as her affair alibi without even asking you to cover for her is insane. Sounds like you didn't even know your sister was having an affair, so how would you know to lie? If she gets a divorce, it's absolutely on her not on you.\n\nSorry that would mean you would be back to sleeping in the kitchen though \n\nYour family sound awful, and I hope you can save money to get away from them as soon as you can.", "NTA but man why don't you call CPS ?

Why do they want your sister to stay married to a guy she is cheating on?", "NTA your sister and parents have no moral compass.  Even if you did know that you were her adultery alibi, lying for her isn\u2019t right.", "NTA. You reacted totally normally to the phone calls. In fact, you reacted with concern for your sister, you automatically went to a place of love rather than assuming she\u2019d done a bad thing (probably, I don\u2019t know her situation). \n\nEven if you did know, it\u2019s uncomfortable to lie about such a thing and people aren\u2019t obligated to. It\u2019s a hell of a leap for them to think this about old sleeping arrangements and it feels a little like they want to pin this general feeling of chaos and specifics of wrongdoings on someone and picked the innocent (but easier?) party - but that\u2019s an assumption on my part. \n\nThe fact that you have been called a \u2018traitor\u2019 and blamed for potentially ending your sister\u2019s marriage over her betrayal and her infidelity is infuriatingly mind numbing.", "Nope, the rest of your family are assholes though.

You did the absolute right thing, don't take it back. Your sister was cheating and your whole family knew. A bunch of AHs. And they are blaming you instead of your cheater sister. Do you have any plans for the future OP? Like going away from college and reduce contact with your parents? Do you have other relatives you could stay with if things get ugly? You are absolutely not in the wrong. By no means. I am sorry but your dad is the bad man and father for having his morals upside down. You did good OP, don't let your family bring you down.", "He said he's from eastern Europe. \nTrust me, 2 bedroom apartments where kids share the lone bedroom and parents sleep in the living room, and another family member on a small bed in the kitchen, is still quite common.", "I'm from France never seen this, but still, if the father said \"you did this because your sister sleep in the bedroom and you in the kitchen\" I can allow myself to think that the father knows it s not normal ...", "Yes obviously OP got the crappiest out of the rooms and his dad knows this. They could have let him and his sister share a room with a partition wall / furniture - it's what we did when we got older, to separate my brother's half and mine and my sister's half of the room. \n\nSome parts of eastern Europe flats are tiny and families make do with what they have. Also when apartments go on the market they are sold per room not bedroom , with 1 \" room \" being the living room which is often turned into a further living space. \n\nI remember having a catch up with a friend who still lives where we grew up and we were discussing how in my opinion it's misleading selling flats as 2 bedrooms when in reality it's 1 bedroom plus the living room ... And she said , well, parents could just sleep in the living room to make do because you don't really need a living room ... To her that mindset is just normal."]}
