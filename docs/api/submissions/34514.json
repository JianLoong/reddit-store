No one had informed me of anything, so I said I didn't know. My sister's husband asked if I was sure. Then he called me another half an hour later and asked if my sister had shown up. I was concerned and asked what was wrong. He didn't answer me anything. I started calling my sister, but she didn't answer the phone. My parents were at work and did not answer my calls either. \n\nIn the evening, when my parents came home from work, they were very angry with me.

I didn't know my sister was having an affair, I hadn't been told about it, and I didn't know what I was supposed to tell her husband. My parents said I was a traitor. They said that my sister had a fight with her husband because of me and that if they divorced, I would move back into the kitchen. \n\nMy dad doesn't talk to me but loudly tells my mom so I can hear that he is disappointed in me, that I should have known to give the right answer to my sister's husband, that I didn't defend my sister, that I am a bad brother and man and that I did it to get back at my sister because she used to sleep in the bedroom and I in the kitchen. \n\nI don't know how to convince my parents that I really didn't know what I was supposed to say. \n\nAlso my mom said that I will have to call my sister's husband and tell him that I lied and my sister was with me and then I will have to ask my sister to forgive me and only if she forgives me my parents will forgive me.", "created_utc": 1704619226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190od3a/aita_for_not_lying_to_my_sisters_husband/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Should you say, She was here she's just gone, or Yes, but she's in the bathroom? Or what? You didn't know which lie to use, you cannot be blamed in any way.", "NTA. Your sister was doing the stupid behind her husband's back and got caught. You should never have to lie to cover your cheating sister. Shame on your sister and parents for defending stupid instead of coming clean.\n\nHopefully, you can move out of the apartment as soon as you turn 18.", ">my sister had sent a text message to her husband that she would be with me all day\n\nThen it's her fault, for not sending you a similar text message.

Whenever I hear stories like this I think \u2018follow the money\u2019. \n\nThe only way the parents would be accepting the affair is if they were getting a cash handout from your BIL and realise if they don\u2019t fix the situation, the money will stop.

If they gave you some sort of warning and asked you to say she was with you I could understand their reaction slightly. But for your sister to be using you as her affair alibi without even asking you to cover for her is insane. Sounds like you didn't even know your sister was having an affair, so how would you know to lie? If she gets a divorce, it's absolutely on her not on you.\n\nSorry that would mean you would be back to sleeping in the kitchen though \n\nYour family sound awful, and I hope you can save money to get away from them as soon as you can.", "NTA but man why don't you call CPS ?

Even if you did know that you were her adultery alibi, lying for her isn\u2019t right.", "NTA. You reacted totally normally to the phone calls. In fact, you reacted with concern for your sister. You automatically went to a place of love rather than assuming she\u2019d done a bad thing (probably, I don\u2019t know her situation). \n\nEven if you did know, it\u2019s uncomfortable to lie about such a thing and people aren\u2019t obligated to. It\u2019s a hell of a leap for them to think this about old sleeping arrangements and it feels a little like they want to pin this general feeling of chaos and specifics of wrongdoings on someone and picked the innocent (but easier?) party - but that\u2019s an assumption on my part. \n\nThe fact that you have been called a \u2018traitor\u2019 and blamed for potentially ending your sister\u2019s marriage over her betrayal and her infidelity is infuriatingly mind numbing.", "Nope, the rest of your family are assholes though.

You did the absolute right thing, don't take it back. Your sister was cheating and your whole family knew. A bunch of AHs. And they are blaming you instead of your cheater sister. Do you have any plans for the future OP? Like going away from college and reduce contact with your parents? Do you have other relatives you could stay with if things get ugly? You are absolutely not in the wrong. By no means. I am sorry but your dad is the bad man and father for having his morals upside down. You did good OP, don't let your family bring you down.", "He said he's from eastern Europe. \nTrust me, 2 bedroom apartments where kids share the lone bedroom and parents sleep in the living room, and another family member on a small bed in the kitchen, is still quite common.", "I'm from France never seen this, but still, if the father said \"you did this because your sister sleep in the bedroom and you in the kitchen\" I can allow myself to think that the father knows it s not normal ...", "Yes obviously OP got the crappiest out of the rooms and his dad knows this. They could have let him and his sister share a room with a partition wall / furniture - it's what we did when we got older, to separate my brother's half and mine and my sister's half of the room. \n\nSome parts of eastern Europe flats are tiny and families make do with what they have. Also when apartments go on the market they are sold per room not bedroom , with 1 \" room \" being the living room which is often turned into a further living space. \n\nI remember having a catch up with a friend who still lives where we grew up and we were discussing how in my opinion it's misleading selling flats as 2 bedrooms when in reality it's 1 bedroom plus the living room ... And she said , well, parents could just sleep in the living room to make do because you don't really need a living room ... To her that mindset is just normal.", "You sister is having an affair and this is your fault??????\n\nsomehow your family\u2019s understanding of blame is mixed up\n\nyou are NTA", "I\u2019d call the BIL exactly as the parents ask, and when he asks where his wife was tell the truth that she was out having an affair.

Even if you did know it isn't your duty to lie for anyone.\n\nI wonder how much of the parents' behaviour is motivated by the fear/knowledge that she'll be moving back in and they'll have to go back to supporting her and extra cramped living.

The first rule of getting someone to cover for you is to let them know that they have to cover for you. You have to get your story straight before hand.", "NTA For all you knew she was in the hospital after being hit by a car. Your family is thinking you have the ability to read minds.

Don't do it. Your integrity is more important than their toxicity. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis is crazy.

They don\u2019t care what she does, as long as it doesn\u2019t impact their finances or their living space. So in their eyes, when OP admitted to her husband that he had no idea where his sister was, *he* was the one who put the family in a tough spot.
