One of the things he should have learned as part of all that therapy he did is that part of the consequences of his actions means that some people won't want to have anything to do with him anymore, and that is a valid choice. A foundational aspect of an abuser's mindset is trying to make other people's choices for them and making other people responsible for the consequences of the abuser's choices. This is part of that trait cropping back up. He's trying to control your actions to make himself feel better and make you responsible for the consequences of his choices again. You don't have to go along with it, no matter what anyone else says.\n\nI told my abuser at one point that I do hope they eventually get help and learn how to do better, and one of the ways I'll know they understand the full extent of what they did is if they never contact me again, because if they understood, they would know why contacting me will always be about them and their wants, not mine. \n\nChanging and growing means your dad respecting other people's choices related to his past behavior, and if he isn't doing that, he hasn't changed quite as fully as he wants people to believe.", "NTA your father's abuse happened to *you.* No one else gets to tell you how to deal with it or when/if you should forgive.

Your dad should have taken responsibility for his mental well-being decades ago before he ever got even close to hurting you. I\u2019m sorry your family is putting all of this on you.

They had no right to send a false text from you to him. What did they think was going to happen? It's not our fault they decided to lie to him.", "NTA\nIt is good that he got help but so.etimes it is just too late.", "Is it weird that I'm thinking NAH?\n\nHere's the thing.  It is BIG that he went and got therapy, that he's stuck with it, that he's truly a better person.  THIS IS EXCELLENT.....for him, and his close family.  I'm glad he's getting the help he needs.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe formative years of a person's life are called that for a REASON.  You were SCARRED by what you went through.  You've had to come to terms with all of it, and it was horrible, and you did what you had to do.  Literally noone can undo what happened to you - including your father.\n\nYou deserve your peace.  If this is how you get it, I am 100% behind you.  I hope that he's able to get his peace in other ways - but even if he might be forgiven for the evil of his sins, the EFFECT of them lives on.", "NTA.", "OP, the biggest NTA ever.  You have the right to your own decisions in this situation. Your siblings' manipulative behavior is unhealthy. Your bio dad is also being demanding.  They made their choices, and you get yours, too. You HAVE to prioritize your mental health and ability to heal and move on in this situation because no one else will.  NTA NTA NTA!", "You're not the asshole and I do not think you owe him anything. Your family needs to stay the fuck out of it because if you want to know his motive you should ask and don't project. \n\n\nRenember your family is shaming you... You do not know your dad's current space and it's up to him to reach out if you're open to it.\n\nSet hard boundaries with the family you\u2019re in communication with", "Sounds like your family is a bunch of flying monkeys. Your dad may have harmed you back then, but they're the ones harming you now in his honor. I would consider going NC with the ones pushing your boundaries so hard.

It\u2019s their lie, not yours.", "I haven\u2019t talked to my father for 30 years and he\u2019s now hospitalised with dementia and is non-verbal and can\u2019t walk\u2026 basically just a vegetable waiting to die. I do not regret cutting him out of my life AT ALL. Absolutely zero regret. Instead I\u2019ve protected myself from someone with a track record of abusing me. You owe him nothing. He made his choices long ago and you are well within your rights to make yours now! Stay strong sister!", "NTA. You don't owe him anything. But seeing as he is 70, I think you need to ask yourself the question of if you are okay with him passing away and you never speaking to him again. Just like, for your own closure. \n\nPersonally, I may want that moment. But I can see how not everyone would. \n\nAlso, your family is the worst for that text message. Damn.", "NTA. It's just as much your right to hold a grudge as it is their right to forgive him.", "YTA. It can all start and end with him, or you can let ptsd become a generational curse. I hope you get some help working through it. You don't want to be a part of his life, That's fine, but it's very obvious you're still angry. I hope you heal.", "YTA, and so are they \n\nYou have every right to be angry with them and your father but the speaker call thing was quite vindictive and had intent to hurt.\n\nPeople being in the right can still be assholes", "YTA.  He did what he did and had a decade to fix that. \nThey certainly were out of line but you're an adult. \nYou could've acted a little bit better.  \nWhether or not you were justified is irrelevant. You behaved like an ass hole.  YTA.", "NTA they fucked up by lying on you \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. No matter what they tell you even a traumatized, mentally ill person has control over their actions. For instance, the power to get help. Or to remove themself from their kids if they see that all they do is hurt them. \n\nAlso, what about your mom?? She was not mentally ill at any point. She just decided to sacrifice you guys and not protect you until child services stepped in. What is her excuse??? She clearly could have done better, she just did not want to.\n\nI find it strange your siblings are obsessing about this after having gone through stuff themselves. At the very least they should see your point and let you be. It seems like they haven't really processed things properly and are still not confronting the reality of that past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of this is your fault. Be free.", "Said it before and will say it again:  An ambush automatically makes you NTA.  Good for you for not letting it work.", "Hey I'm really sorry about all that happened to you, it wasn't right. You have every right not to see or talk to your dad  but could you do some research on PTSD from military service and bipolar disorder. This stuff is really heavy and so tragic. Maybe you could try to understand what happened to your dad? Again this is in no way justification for what y'all went through.", "NTA. But.............PTSD in vets is a very real thing and before you make a decision that may haunt you once he passes, please do some research on the affliction. If nothing else (even if you still don't want to have a thing to do with him), the research may give you some peace. \n\nI feel so sad for you that you were in this environment growing up, but PTSD has only been recognized medically and socially for about 20 years and the defense force themselves held the rug over it for as long as they possibly could. They were sending kids to do a job that no one should ever, ever have to do - and they still are.  I'm so glad he sought help, instead of committing suicide, as many thousands of vets around the world do. Good luck sweetheart.", "YTA but everyone in this situation is. \n\nThey wore you down and didn\u2019t respect your boundaries. Trauma or not, you are not required to have a relationship with blood relatives. It\u2019s sad, of course! \n\nBut you should have stayed strong with your non-contact approach. By going in halfway you got his hopes up and it\u2019s kind of mean to do that to a 70 year old.", "100%. They think OP is cruel? They\u2019re the ones demanding a victim play nice to their abuser  AND getting the old man\u2019s hopes up in some sort of sick, weird attempt to manipulate and guilt the victim into it when they set clear boundaries.\n\nActions have consequences. If this man is TRULY holding himself accountable for the harm he caused, he would not *expect* anything from OP. And we don\u2019t have his side, but if he actually respected OP\u2019s wishes and was willing to respect their space and these people got his hopes up anyway? Holy Christ, that\u2019s so awful.\n\nHonestly sounds as if OP not speaking to him is an uncomfortable reminder of the past for them. Can\u2019t think of any other reason for them to be hounding like this. Well, OP isn\u2019t responsible for their feelings about their relationship with him.", "Huge NTA!

I love how you worded it so much more!", "Oh goodness that\u2019s brilliantly put. Thank you.", "Tbh me and my siblings all have trauma but we don\u2019t force it on others or publicly (semi via speaker) over something that can be handled more privately.

Allow OP to confront her dad and go through what happened and help at least break it down before building it up, I\u2019d say maybe\u2026 maybe if it were me, I\u2019d mull it over after speaking to a therapist and even think of meeting the dad with therapist present.\n\nIt is ultimately up to OP who was the victim and now survivor. \n\nJust because someone suffers from a serious MH issue doesn\u2019t make the hit any less painful.", "I was abused from childhood to adulthood by my mother. It took me years to come to terms with that, and a little bit longer to realize that cutting her off was the best thing for me and my mental health.\n\nThere are many reasons why someone who is or was abused stays in contact with their abuser. So chill out with the accusatory question.", "Correction: your brother and mom are definitely jerks in this.  They shouldn't be putting you or him through this.  They gambled on the story and text and lost.  It's on THEM, not you.", "One of the big things that helped me make peace with my dad is that when I took him to therapy and said everything I needed to say, he just accepted it was his fault and said he was sorry. I had been so scared that he would get defensive because the abuse had occurred years ago or because he\u2019d gotten therapy and changed, but he never invalidated any of my feelings. I think that showed me that he really had changed and that he truly did want to work things out and move on. Had he put up a wall or tried to direct the conversation, I might not be talking to him anymore today!", "OP may have cptsd from the abuse as well. They are being incredibly cruel to op, and not terribly bright with the stunt they played with the father.", "Mine tried to play this card, by literally posting cards through my letterbox for me and my sister and brother. He got the cards returned with a massive f u wrote across each. I also threw in how I was the one that screwed his and his gf's chance at fostering or adopting.\n\nTurns out he had cancer and wanted to make amends. No, suffer and deal with the fact 3/4 of your children hate you. \n\nOP is 100% NTA, every other person that took part is.  Nobody and nothing they do requires forgiveness or a relationship after abuse.", "She didn't want to speak to her abuser.  She knew that her conduits to him (siblings) lied and made him believe she was interested in a relationship.

If he really believes his kid somehow \u201cowes\u201d him absolution for what he did, he hasn\u2019t changed at all.", "To be fair, it might not be the father saying this. Based on the manipulative triangulation of the other family members, they might be using charged language to try and guilt trip OP.\n\nConsidering they tried to literally fake a reconciliation, little lies like that are small potatoes.", "Yeah, if he wanted to make things right, why not write a letter and leave it up to you to open it and make the next move? That would be the right first step here because the power still resides with you. Instead it seems they're trying to guilt you into seeing him so he can feel better about himself.\n\nNTA, sorry you have to go through all this.", "To be fair, OP, your father might not have actually said anything about \u201cabsolving guilt.\u201d If they\u2019re willing to fake a reconciliation, why not lie about what your father said to make you feel guilty? \n\nShit, how do you know they were at a party? Or that your father cried? Or maybe they even lied about sending the fake text in the first place?", "> He's free to reach out, even persistently,\n\nNo, I don't think so. I mean technically he's free to do so, but to do so is an extension of the abusive dynamic, not an attempt to make amends.", "I never said that. I never said anything like that. I\u2019m just expressing my feelings because this story hits close to home for me. NTA is the right decision.", "Probably only sounds accusatory to YOU, because you are projecting.", "Honestly I can\u2019t imagine why they would put you on speaker, that\u2019s kinda on them. Could\u2019ve lied and said it was on speaker until they knew how the conversation was gonna go.", "Your probably right\u2026 it\u2019s just so frustrating when people start self doubting themselves - when they are the only sane people most of the time!, And did what any reasonable person would do.", "Agreed, if he has really changed his abusive ways then he should be happy to let go of control and do what's best for his child, even if it's not what he would prefer.  Continuing to reach out against OP's will is selfish.", "Nah I'm NC with my abuser and it sounds accusatory to me too.", "Being heard and acknowledged can be healing, abusers make you question yourself, what happened, why it happened. If you can approach it from that direction and get something from it, it can help. I think any conversation is at the victims desecration, the same with its outcomes.
