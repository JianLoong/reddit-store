One of the things he should have learned as part of all that therapy he did is that part of the consequences of his actions means that some people won't want to have anything to do with him anymore, and that is a valid choice. A foundational aspect of an abuser's mindset is trying to make other people's choices for them and making other people responsible for the consequences of the abuser's choices. This is part of that trait cropping back up. He's trying to control your actions to make himself feel better and make you responsible for the consequences of his choices again. You don't have to go along with it, no matter what anyone else says.\n\nI told my abuser at one point that I do hope they eventually get help and learn how to do better, and one of the ways I'll know they understand the full extent of what they did is if they never contact me again, because if they understood, they would know why contacting me will always be about them and their wants, not mine. \n\nChanging and growing means your dad respecting other people's choices related to his past behavior, and if he isn't doing that, he hasn't changed quite as fully as he wants people to believe.", "NTA your father's abuse happened to *you.* No one else gets to tell you how to deal with it or when/if you should forgive.

F that! \n\nYou're not a bad person for wanting to keep moving on from the abuse you were subjected to. \n\nHonestly, if I were you, and not able to/planning on going NC with those pressuring you to forgive and forget, I'd write a list of the things he did and the age you were when he did this things.

If you owe someone money offer to make payments, if you hurt them in some other way that is more difficult to make amends for, ask them what you can do to make amends and do that.

You can't force your apology on them, you aren't entitled to their forgiveness, and even if they hear you out and let you make amends, they don't have to accept it!!! If this dude really got help, any halfway decent therapist or group therapy would tell him he can try to make amends but if the other party isn't interested to leave it alone and let them come to them. To continue to force it on the other person is doing more harm and is solely a selfish action to make themselves feel better. This dad may have gotten better, but he still has a lot of work to do.
