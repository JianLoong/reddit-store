One of the things he should have learned as part of all that therapy he did is that part of the consequences of his actions means that some people won't want to have anything to do with him anymore, and that is a valid choice. A foundational aspect of an abuser's mindset is trying to make other people's choices for them and making other people responsible for the consequences of the abuser's choices. This is part of that trait cropping back up. He's trying to control your actions to make himself feel better and make you responsible for the consequences of his choices again. You don't have to go along with it, no matter what anyone else says.\n\nI told my abuser at one point that I do hope they eventually get help and learn how to do better, and one of the ways I'll know they understand the full extent of what they did is if they never contact me again, because if they understood, they would know why contacting me will always be about them and their wants, not mine. \n\nChanging and growing means your dad respecting other people's choices related to his past behavior, and if he isn't doing that, he hasn't changed quite as fully as he wants people to believe.", "NTA your father's abuse happened to *you.* No one else gets to tell you how to deal with it or when/if you should forgive.

Given that, your sibs were completely wrong to go against your stance and put words in your mouth.", "You need to forgive your father for your own sake because bitterness can eat your soul.  **BUT** forgiveness does not mean that you have a relationship with the person.  I would write your father a letter telling him that you understand that he had PTSD and that you forgive him for the abuse that he heaped upon you.  However, for your own mental wellbeing you cannot have a relationship with him. Unfortunately, there are consequences for bad behavior.  **NTA**", "NTA\n\nYou have no responsibility or obligation to either of your parents. Your mental health is more important than the flawed opinions of others. You need to do what is best for you & if others continue to harass you, cut contact with them as well until they can respect your choices.", "Yep. NTA.", "Ring a ding ding, spot on with this one.", "Mic drop.", "Exactly this, it\u2019s OP\u2019s decision and needs to be respected by their family. NTA", "*I told my abuser at one point that I do hope they eventually get help and learn how to do better, and one of the ways I'll know they understand the full extent of what they did is if they never contact me again, because if they understood, they would know why contacting me will always be about them and their wants, not mine.*\n\nYour entire post is great, but the part I quoted just shows incredible insight.", "The father's request sounds really selfish too - not about apologizing to OP or messing up for his past wrongs, but wanting to not feel guilty. \n\nNTA.", "I doubt the siblings reconnected with him just because he said sorry. They are convinced he's completely changed and they forgive him. Still, they can't force anyone else to forgive him or engage with him. He's free to reach out, even persistently, but he's not entitled to forgiveness or connection. If he reaches out in a way that irks OP, he shows that he doesn't care abt her feelings.\n\nI don't know why every time there's conflict between 2 members the whole family has to get involved and take side. Can't they just help the members with their feelings but leave them alone to resolve their conflicts?", "Actually, he is 8 years older. I think he just always really wanted a father figure I guess. He is very family oriented in general.\n\nThe only younger sibling is my sister and she is 100% on my side and told me to just do my thing and ignore others.", "Tbh I don't even know myself what his motives are. The first quote is what they say he says, the second quote is what I, myself, think it comes across as.\n\nI do think the graphic truth part is brilliant!", "This needs to be done, I\u2019ll never understand why the person (that\u2019s in the right) is ALWAYS the one that family or friends tell to apologize. F-that! You did nothing wrong. NTA", "Exactly. It sounds like he hasn't changed if he can't accept his responsibility for his actions and the possibility that OP may never want to see or speak with him again.", "That was said by the brother not the father.", "Hey, I found my handsome prince and am living happily ever after while the main villain in defeated. Sounds pretty much like a fairytale ending to me \ud83d\ude0e", "It doesn't matter.  Literally nobody owes their abuser a \"second chance.\"  If it's bad enough to be abuse, you're literally *never* the asshole for saying no. Not ever.  No matter what demons that person was going through.", "What does this matter to the verdict?", "Hi\nI don't think that the Bipolar Disorder was what doomed him. He just worked on it too late aka. after all the damage was already done. It would be like fixing cavities in an already pulled out tooth. \n\nThere are many people who didn't get the luckiest hands regarding mental health but are still great people.", "That's fair.\nI'd like to add that I said it on the speaker so that he hears it so my mom or brother don't get the wiggle room to make some other lie. I tried saying it as clear and civil as possible but yeah, maybe I should have told my brother to give the phone to my dad. That one's on me.", "OP was abused. They don\u2019t have to forgive their abuser simply because he got help. They can deal with it on their own, as they\u2019ve done to for 13+ years.", "Hi, mentally ill person here, if I abused someone while untreated that person would NOT owe me a damn thing.", "NTA. It too easy to say \"everyone deserves a second chance\" and it's quite insulting, here.\nAfter abuse and 13 years of NC, OP made the choice to keep prioritize her well being and she's right.\nSometimes it's better to end everything than dealing with bullshit (her family can't even respect her decision and lied).\nToo bad for her dad, but she's not responsible for his abusing behaviour (PTSD or not) and she has no obligation to forget or forgive.\nYou can't erase what she had to deal with before, with him or on her own.", "Because they are living in the now. They see an old man who is sorry for what he has done it seems, who did go and seek professional help, and truly wants to try and make things right. \n\nDoes this make op wrong for refusing?  No.", "Because they are \"rocking the boat\" when everyone else doesn't want to face the reality of the situation", "Ah, thanks. Will edit.", "Mental health care for Viet Nam vets was rather nonexistent as a support when they came home. It\u2019s a point of curiosity as much as anything, but it would be a good clarification as to Dad\u2019s issues.", "I completely understand. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t at all disagree with your decision. It just makes me sad and wish that the disorder didn\u2019t exist. It hurts too many people, both those diagnosed and the people around them.", ">I'd like to add that I said it on the speaker so that he hears it so my mom or brother don't get the wiggle room to make some other lie.\n\nThis is ultimately the greater good: Your father\u2019s risk of being deceived by his wife and son is now greatly reduced, and your mom and brother\u2019s opportunities to coerce you socially are now also reduced. Good for you for not allowing lies to the dark.", "Yes, now he will know the rest of the family is lying to him, and you have set clear boundaries. Hopefully, you can mend things with your mom and brother.", "OP also needs some therapy, and maybe they got it, I don't know. Abuse is a lot for a person to handle on their own.", "Thank you for pointing the \"insulting\" part!", "Unfortunately for OP, the other family members are making it so much worse with the lies rather then just telling Dad the truth.", "How exactly can you make things right? To Say I\u2019m sorry that I f\u2019ed your life up so bad that I lost custody of you and now I\u2019m going to say sorry and you need to forgive me and forget what I did to you\u2026. Is that it?", "Hello,\nActually, Yugoslav Wars", "Fair about the curiosity, and I know mental health care for vets is still bad, but since he has apparently gone to therapy it seems moot in the current situation. No matter the explanation, it's still not an excuse, and doesn't mean OP has to be around their abuser just to make their abuser feel better. I admit I get defensive when the conversation turns to why the abuser is abusing, because it almost always becomes about excusing their actions and putting more burden on the victims. It needs to be it's own conversation, not only brought up as a response to a survivor setting boundaries", "They\u2019ve probably had to, and some prefer to do it that way.", "That's not on OP.", "Also, I don't really mean that the dad must be forgiven. I mean that I think addressing the concerns face on and making a decision about that now is better IMO. Forgive or walk away forever, I don't care, just talk to him, address problems, etc.", "He isn\u2019t owed a conversation.", "Hello\nI'd like to add that I got professional help as a kid. I feel like a healthy adult. \nAlso, years of abuse aren't nothing. He had more than two chances during that time.", "I didn't mean to imply at all that the years of abuse should be minimilized or that they \"were nothing\"."]}
