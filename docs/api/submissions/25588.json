Whenever I'm going to a new restaurant, I always research the menu beforehand to mentally prepare myself for what I'll eat. Unexpected changes can be really hard for me.\n\nMy friend \"Lily\" is vegan and celebrated her birthday yesterday. She decided to invite our friend group dine at a health-focused restaurant that, while offering many vegetarian/vegan options, also serves chicken and fish dishes. Before going, I checked the menu and decided on grilled salmon with mashed potatoes (planning to ignore the side salad).\n\nWhen we arrived, Lily requested that we all choose to eat vegetarian for the night for her birthday. I apologized and explained that there wasn\u2019t a vegetarian option I liked in the menu. Everyone else agreed to her request, and she persisted with me. I expressed that had I known this beforehand, I would've eaten at home and just ordered a vegetarian appetizer. I was genuinely hungry by that point. After some back and forth, I asked if I should leave and she allowed me to stay, but the atmosphere was tense.\n\nThe rest of the evening was awkward, with Lily avoiding conversation with me. Today I texted her and asked if everything was ok between us, but she responded by saying I'm too spoiled, and an asshole for not even doing the one thing she asked for her birthday I'm not confrontational by nature, so I apologized again and responded by asking her to inform me in advance next time.

It's very unfriend like to try to force your choices on others.", "Depends. Did she pay for the meal?

RealPaj blocked me before I could reply so Pescatarian is not a branch of vegetarianism. Fish is meat, and it has to die for you to eat it.

If they were, meat and dairy would be the protagonists.", "But telling someone just before ordering about your expectations is ridiculous.

The demand for vegan products is growing exponentially.", "Also, I didn't vote you down just for having a debate, yet every comment of mine, despite me not judging your food ethics, has been. On that note, I hope you do go away and research, rather than base your entire argument on opinion. However, I doubt it, so goodbye, and good luck.", "I'm basing it on fact. Omni food gets marketed, because they can afford to do so. Vegan food gets marketed too, but you see it much less because that's what their budget allows for. If they had more demand, they'd have a bigger budget, and we'd see more ads. That is how advertising works. So I am \"subjected\" to vegan ads for beyond meat and such, it's just not as frequent, because they can't afford it. But I ignore them like all other ads I'm not interested in and move on. That's a lot easier to avoid than IRL encounters. \n\nAnd there are PLENTY of vegans who try to force their shit on others. I've had the misfortune of experiencing them on multiple occasions. Have a quick look at the vegan sub and it's the opposite of the Facebook stuff you mentioned (I don't use FB so can't comment on that).", "If the demand is there, why don't they have the advertising budgets to compete?", "I'm not downvoting either, someone must just have the same view I do."]}
