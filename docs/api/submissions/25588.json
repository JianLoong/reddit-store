Whenever I'm going to a new restaurant, I always research the menu beforehand to mentally prepare myself for what I'll eat. Unexpected changes can be really hard for me.\n\nMy friend \"Lily\" is vegan and celebrated her birthday yesterday. She decided to invite our friend group dine at a health-focused restaurant that, while offering many vegetarian/vegan options, also serves chicken and fish dishes. Before going, I checked the menu and decided on grilled salmon with mashed potatoes (planning to ignore the side salad).\n\nWhen we arrived, Lily requested that we all choose to eat vegetarian for the night for her birthday. I apologized and explained that there wasn\u2019t a vegetarian option I liked in the menu. Everyone else agreed to her request, and she persisted with me. I expressed that had I known this beforehand, I would've eaten at home and just ordered a vegetarian appetizer. I was genuinely hungry by that point. After some back and forth, I asked if I should leave and she allowed me to stay, but the atmosphere was tense.\n\nThe rest of the evening was awkward, with Lily avoiding conversation with me. Today I texted her and asked if everything was ok between us, but she responded by saying I'm too spoiled, and an asshole for not even doing the one thing she asked for her birthday I'm not confrontational by nature, so I apologized again and responded by asking her to inform me in advance next time.
