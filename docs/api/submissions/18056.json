You are planning to move out when you have the money. It\u2019s called being financially responsible. It\u2019s not the 70s anymore when one person working as a teacher could buy a house after saving for a year.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister judges you for not being independent when she has never been. She just changed the people she was dependent on - parents to boyfriend to next boyfriend.  \n\nYou are smart to save up and wait to have children when you are ready.  Some people try to justify their own life choices by criticizing others for theirs.", "NTA. Your sister sounds obnoxious", "NTA.  In my lack of coffee mind this morning, im getting vibes of her being jealous of you.\n\nMaybe for rushing to marriage, rushing to motherhood, whatever but it almost sounds like she\u2019s envious of you so needs to try to put you down.\n\nYou do you, it\u2019s not like you are mooching off of family while you save, you are being responsible as a \u2018tenant\u2019 and financially for your future.  Not really her business.", "NTA, sister has a weird notion of independency , and thinks her's was exactly that. Sometimes a small strong dose of truth keep such people in reality", "NTA\n\nYour sister is judgemental, and a hypocrite. She's never lived on her own, she's in no position to judge. That she switched your parents' house for her boyfriend's parents' house is hardly the home run she thinks it is.\n\nPerhaps she is jealous that you made choices she wishes in retrospect that she had made. \n\nRegardless of her reasons, it's not appropriate or acceptable for her to be so nasty to you or to belittle your life choices. \n\nWhat kind of sister does that? Hint: not a decent one.\n\nAnd no, there's nothing wrong with waiting till your 30s to have kids. You know this and I sense self-belief in your choices. Don't let her spoil that. \n\nSounds like she owes you an apology, frankly.", "NTA. I had my kids in my 30s, it's not that old. I also don't think you have to apologise for your comment, she doesn't seem to be apologetic about hers either, does she? Laughing at you for your life choices instead of respecting them is an a**hole move.", "NTA, Your sister definitely is.\n\nYou're doing the right thing by waiting until you're actually ready to have a kid or kids.\n\nOnly thing you did wrong was apologise to her, she's the one that owes you an apology.", "NTA. It always rubs me wrong when someone acts like they did everything on their own, and the fact that you didn't is some kind of flaw. Newsflash: none of us do everything on our own. There are always partnerships, and sometimes just being in the right place at the right time can make a world of difference in our lives. Your working, your paying your way, do your own thing. And, as someone who had kids at 20, and again in my 30s (as well as some in between) it is easier at 30 than it was at 20, and I don't believe that all of it was because of experience with kids, some of it is just being older, more stable, and more mature.", "NTA\n\nSay stupid opinions, expect a harsh reply", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You may not realize it but she is jealous  of  you which is why she said what she did. Whenever someone tries to belittle you to make themselves sound better it is because they are insecure about something in themselves. Children come with responsibilities and the lack of freedom to do what you want , go where you want and live how you want without having to think about or take care of someone else. Having kids can be great but you have to make sacrifices. My guess is she resents the child free lifestyle you have at the moment.  She may have a rich husband  but that doesn't mean she is happy.", "NTA, when her husband trades her in for a younger model make sure to laugh and tell her that she's so old to be a divorced single mom in her 30s.", "NTA. Your sister sounds smug and unpleasant. Ignore her silly remarks and concentrate on your own life. Ive got one or two family members who your sister reminds me of, looking down at us peasants from their high towers. I dont spend too long in their company.", "nothing wrong with still living at home.", "NTA. Why do so many people think that what they did is the only way to do things? Everyone has a different journey. OP, you do what works for you and ignore the jealous people. Love your retort too.", "NTA. Your sister lives in an extremely small, sad world.", "NTA many people have very rigid views on what being an independent adult is. Like in her case, being \u201cindependent\u201d somehow just means not living with one\u2019s own parents but it\u2019s totally fine to rely on someone else\u2019s or someone else entirely lol. I have a coworker like this \u2014 critical of anyone who can\u2019t afford to move out of their parents\u2019 home the second they reach adulthood while they themselves have gone straight from their parents\u2019 home to living with a spouse. Living is typically more affordable when you\u2019re not having to pay for everything on your own.\n\nI\u2019m also assuming she doesn\u2019t have health issues, so she\u2019s navigating life on a lower difficulty setting in that respect. She sounds like she wants to attribute her situation to competence rather than luck and privilege.", "NTA\n\nShe's clearly jelaous and bitter because she made those big decisions too early, now regrets it, and can't stand that your life is just about to start.\n\nDon't pay attention, follow your plans.", "NTA, I was 28 or 29 before I lived completely alone. Before that, I lived with family or roommates. Don't get caught up by someone else's arbitrary timeline. You just worry about yourself.", "NTA\n\nJudging your life choices while you\u2019re a guest in her home in front of another guest is a-hole behavior.", "My sister had her baby at 39 and she's happy. My other sister had a baby at 20 and she's also happy. Risks increase once you're over 35, but there will always be some risk. There's no rule, have children when you're ready. NTA.\nI also have a sister that judges me for living at home when she lives with her boyfriend's family lol I thought I wrote this at first.", "NTA", "NTA - Your sister tried to blast you for making smart and well thought out plans for your life. She's rellied on other people her entire adult life...So she really has no room to judge you for deciding to wait.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds like a judgmental bully. Wtf is it to her when you start a family. She is unhappy/ non independent and jealous. I wouldn\u2019t share anything about my life with her", "NTA, your sister is stupidly judgemental and clearly doesn't understand what life's like if you're not relying on a husband paying your way for you", "NTA. Hubs and I waited until our 30s to have our first. We're financially stable, emotionally stable, we have a solid home and great foundation to our marriage and partnership, and we wouldn't have had it any other way before having our first kid. \n\nI don't understand people who think someone choosing to do things differently from themselves is some kind of attack...", "Why is it that people who feel entitled to give their UNASKED FOR opinions are always mad when they're called out? Like get out of the damn kitchen if you can't take the heat. OP is being VERY smart in this market. Everything is so damn expensive, she's wise to stay with her parents until she has a nice little nest egg. NTA", "Not to mention children of older parents have greater advantages than children of younger parents. Whilst both can have advantages and disadvantages, children of older parents generally benefit from better financial resources, parents who are emotionally more stable, leading to a more stable, better behaved child. Just those two benefits alone can lead to a child doing better educationally.\n\nInterest article [here](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/5-advantages-being-older-parent-ncna775581)\n\nI forgot NTA, both sisters are making the right choices for them but the older sister sounds insecure and toxic.", ">sounds like your sister judges you for not being independent when she has never been.\n\nDoes she judge op or is she jealous of op?", "She\u2019s certainly expressing judgment. Motives could be jealousy or justification of her own choices.", "NTA, sis sounds pretty childish", "NTA\n\nHonestly, 25 is too young imo \n\nYou are barely an adult\n\nYou have no real professional accomplishments\n\nYou don't really know who you are yet. \n\nI think women are lucky to have so many more options to delay having children so that they can do so when they are more established and don't have to give up their other ambitions and life experiences bc of course, becoming a parent changes everything and you can't put yourself first anymore.\n\nAlso, outcomes for children of more established parents are generally better. But anyhow. \n\nEveryone is different but it's such a limited way of thinking that you should even want to have kids in your 20s or even early 30s.\n\nAs we live longer and healthier, so should the age range we view having kids at evolve.", "People who don't want to be judged shouldn't be so god damned judgemental themselves.", "NTA, if people act like assholes they don't get to call foul when they get it in return. I doubt she apologized to you.", "I don't judge people who live with their parents. I'm just always amazed people can handle it. I think both sides frequently get benefits from it.", "Or even the 90s. I moved out at 24, had no roommates, and bought an apartment at 28 on a secretary's salary.", "Jealousy in parenthood (with people like OPs sister) almost always translates to judgement.", "She judges. A lot of dependents are disconnected from the fact that their spouse\u2019s financial stability and achievements aren\u2019t their own.\n\nOP\u2019s sister has one achievement - marrying someone rich enough to provide for her, like a child.", "NTA It\u2019s super weird she is so obsessed and competitive with your life plans. Sounds like she might be insecure. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you that you\u2019ve met your goals. My goals are different and I hope as my sister you can be happy that I\u2019m progressing towards my goals.\u201d", " NTA so she can give her unsolicited opinion on your life, and you can\u2019t say anything about hers?  \nShe could just mind her own business.", "NTA. Having kids in your 30s is fine, normal, and arguably more responsible in a lot of cases. My parents had me and my sister in their thirties. We turned out FINE.", "NTA: Hope her marriage is rock solid. Because that\u2019s going to be a wake up call she\u2019s not ready for. She went from living with your parents, living with her BF parents and then getting married. She has no clue on the way the \u201creal\u201d world works.", "Your sister is the AH here.\n\nShe is a leech that has lived off your parents and off her partners after that, and she is the one that she should be apologizing to you.\n\nIf she brings it up again, just remind her of her parasitic ways.", "Having a kid in your early 30's is old now? *Laughs in European*\n\nCome on, the average age for a woman to have her first child is about 30 in the whole of the EU (31.3 in both Spain and Italy for example, 30.1 for my country).\n\nSource, for any interested readers: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20210224-1#:~:text=The%20mean%20age%20of%20women,period%2C%20though%20to%20varying%20degrees.)", "True, I'm always amazed by how young some of the parents and grandparents on here are. \n\nI'm never sure if it's reddit or the USA, the pattern I see on here seems to be early 20's.\n\nI am still horrified by my birth year not being on the chart,  when my sons UK primary school made a display on when our parents were young. I hadn't at that point considered myself an elderly parent at 35 with a 5 year old! On the plus side I bonded with the other \"elderly\" mum."]}
