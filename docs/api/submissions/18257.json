But you could also make the argument he never gave her that money, that was money he was planning to spend (irresponsibly) himself.

Even OP, who is seemingly taking $100 from him even though she now knows he only had $180 (and apparently that\u2019s everything to *live on*), still said it\u2019s not entirely his fault.", "Unironically, yeah, a little bit. I truly think if the genders were reversed, people might see this in a different light. Imagine I guy taking money his gf explicitly gave him for one thing and putting it towards a \"debt\" she owed him. I put debt in quotations simply because I truly believe that a lot of people jumping to the NA conclusion for her, would also be the ones saying that, if the situation was reversed, the bf would be an AH for even calling the money, \"a debt to be paid.\" I mean, a bf giving money to his gf and then acting like she owes him everytime they go out? I highly doubt that'd go well in this sub.(As it shouldn't imo)\n\nI give money to my gf all the time to help her financially. I don't expect a single cent back.

Always act like it's a gift.", "He's creating memories all right!", "*\"He got so upset and complained that ***now*** he has only $80 for the rest of the fortnight until his next pay...\"*\n\nHe did say \"now\". And it's evident that OP is the one factoring in his debt and not the bf. His priorities are different and much more merrily inclined.", "If a dude did this to his gf I would be thinking it was controlling to the point of concern.", "Oh nah, if the genders were reversed she'd be called a gold digger.\n\nShe shouldn't have lend him money of course, but that doesn't mean that his irresponsibility is her fault.", "Agreed", "I am in shock to not see a YTA at the top. This looks abusive even. She is basically saying he cannot live until the debt is paid; they tried to arrange a nice thing and instead of saying 'sorry, i think you need to be more careful with the spending' she stole from him to go towards the money he owes her. Agree a payment plan over X amount of months, relax about it, and then he may be TA not her.", "I am a bit like the gf where I'm very stingy and very careful with money. But I would never loan out money to someone I knew would never pay me back really if it was that big of a deal to me to get the money back. That is honestly just common sense. They're not even married or anything so it's all on him and won't fall back on her in any capacity if he defaults. But you absolutely can not take someones money and lie about what you're doing with it. It's illegal even if it was a \"good financial decision\". Legally gf can be brought to court over it and would lose assuming there's proof of this discussion like text. \n\nIt's also really ridiculous to not expect someone to never buy any sort of want even if they are in the red. No financial advisor would suggest that just suggest you really limit it. It's not sustainable and even during the great depression people treated themselves to wants like women buying lipstick as it helps them hold on to something and their sanity. If that's the case no one with student loans, car loans, mortgage etc should buy anything they want until they pay off their debt. We are one of the only nations where that's \"acceptable\" to be thousands in debt and still be buying a bunch of things we want. If the gf is so adamant about finances then why doesn't she help set up an appointment with a financial advisor instead of illegally taking his money?", "I suppose that\u2019s true but this example would be quite extreme, and mostly when people think that people are profligate and poor it\u2019s snobbery, they imagine that people are only poor because they buy takeaways and luxury items. In reality they are poor because they got into a bad situation. I\u2019m speaking generally here, not about this couple. Even OP says it is not his fault, has been able to pay her back, yet still frames it as her being superior with money.\n\nIME people who only have $180 to *live off* tend to be very aware of how much they have and even the ones who make bad choices don\u2019t tend to spend it on holidays, and if they do then they tend not to pay other people back on their debts, which OP says he has been doing. That\u2019s why it seems more likely that, if it is genuinely that amount, it more likely means \u2018spending money\u2019 but hey, we don\u2019t know do we - I just try to counter the Reddit groupthink where I see it.", "Like i said. I\u2019m aware that OP said so.", "Y\u2019know what\u2019s funny about this conclusion? She\u2019s the only one factoring in the debt, yet he has paid the majority of it back and there is no reason to suggest she took it from him against his will like she did this time. Meanwhile, he definitely only had $180 to live on for a fortnight, which clearly is impossible for anyone (which is why I know it\u2019s untrue but that\u2019s an aside), yet OP is still right to take $100 of it to pay back the debt without his permission.\n\nThe mental gymnastics are wild here.", "Maybe one or two, but the vast majority would be focused on him.\n\nNever said it was, but it is now partly her problem to deal with. Again, I feel the same about the reverse situation", "I think ESH is the best judgement. You shouldn't lend money you can't afford to lose, especially to a SO; but if you agree to pay someone back, live within your means and don't buy luxuries (a plane ticket/hotel/Uber rides) you can't afford at this time.\n\nHer AH judgement comes from the fact he thought his money was going towards seeing her, which is a luxury he can't afford at this point, which is why he's an AH", "Not judging here either, the people I knew with less weren't spending willy nilly either. OP just said that he gets frustrated and wants to spend sometimes even when he really shouldn't. Seems like this is one of those times where he shouldn't consider going on a trip\u2014and it was disengenuous for OP to accept that money under false pretenses. I think she should return the money since he is paying her back slowly.", "Yeah fair, but we are supposed to take OPs account and judge accordingly, unless of course some missing reasons are spotted that show OP is an unreliable narrator. Which this contained low conflict situation doesn't have, so I can see no reason to prettify it.", "I'm not saying OP is in the right, it's a clear ESH from me.\n\nHe has paid it off, with her help, as per OP he asked her to help manage his money. \n\nAnyway, the point that he had only $180 for the reminder of the fortnight is another indication that he is bad with money. As if it's hard to go into debt/more debt when you don't have enough. That's very realistic.\n\n>The mental gymnastics are wild here.\n\nLol says the one who bent themself in a pretzel over it.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, the logic of what she is saying doesn\u2019t make sense and that is why she is unreliable narrator. People always make themselves sound better and the other person worse, they can\u2019t help it.\n\nIf she is not an AH, why is she still keeping $100 of his last $180 even though it supposedly will prevent him from being to eat or pay his bills?", "Fair enough, I associated the refusal to consider any alternative scenario with an assumption you would vote NTA, so that\u2019s my mistake.\n\nI agree he is not good with money overall, I didn\u2019t ever say he wasn\u2019t. I just think OP, and the assertion of this thread (that he \u201conly had $180 to his name and decided to spend most of it on a flight\u201d) is overdoing it a bit. That\u2019s all, and I think when you add up all of the bits it\u2019s a fair conclusion, because it\u2019s unlikely that he is making himself unable to eat in order to go on holiday - if he were that bad OP would not have seen a dollar of what she lent him, and OP wouldn\u2019t be keeping the $100 now she knows he will go hungry. It doesn\u2019t add up. Far more likely, it\u2019s simply that he has factored in all he has to pay already ie budgeted OR OP misinterpreted.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with me of course, it\u2019s just an internet opinion, same as yours."]}
