Could have just said no. \n\n\nHe could grow up a bit more and realize that he\u2019d have been out more than just the 100- there\u2019s also the Ubers and probably some food. So figure at least 20 in Uber rides (and that\u2019s being generous, h less the hotel is right by the airport, Probably more like 40) plus another 40 or more in food.\n\nIt sounds like you two are on totally different wavelengths when it comes to finances.", "Esh\n\nHe's terrible with money.\n\nAlso, he's not \"being a man\" by paying when he owes you money. He is spending your money or at the very least money that should go to you, to stoke his ego.\n\nHe sounds immature and irresponsible", "How the hell was he planning to holiday on the \"$80 he had left for the rest of the fortnight\"? Is he a moocher, expected you to pay for all the meals?", "ESH. \n\nYou lied to him & manipulated him. Did he deserve it? I think so but was it fair to him? No, since you got the money under false pretenses. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be planning vacations and extras while he owes you money. Especially since he doesn\u2019t have a payment plan and trying to stick to it. \n\nHowever, It doesn\u2019t give you the right to get your money back by pretending to order tickets for a trip. \n\nYou need to tell him that you won\u2019t go on any trips, get him any tickets (especially at a discounted rate). Or even go out where he is spending money while he still owes you. \n\nGive him a payment plan to return your funds & stick to it.", "YTA; that\u2019s just blatantly lying to Your partner", "ESH. I\u2019m not really understanding all the YTA\u2019s but it\u2019s Reddit so, whatever. You shouldn\u2019t have taken the money for one thing and spent it differently. You should have said, no, you still owe me I don\u2019t think that\u2019s responsible. But literally, he owed you $400. It\u2019s not controlling for you to not purchase things for him or use your discount for him when he owes you that kind of money. He\u2019s clearly irresponsible with his money. And emotionally manipulative with the \u201cI just want to spend time with you\u201d business. \nHonestly his lack of responsibility is something you need to consider moving forward. Overspenders don\u2019t magically change their habits, it takes a lot of work and support and you\u2019re going to look like the bad guy a lot.", "YTA\n\nYou took the money under false pretenses. That is a lie by omission.", "YTA.\n\nIs him going on a trip smart when he owes you money? No. But you explicitly lied to him and that's not ok.", "YTA - This comes across as deliberately hurting your boyfriend while you're still claiming to be helping him. There are words for actions like this.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like he has been working towards paying off his debt and give you the money you are owed, rather than flaking off and never paying. You decided to lie to him and take money under false pretenses. Now he knows better than to trust you.", "**YTA** \\- He gave you the 100 dollars thinking you were going to book a flight for him, and he would not have given you it if you told him you want him to save money. Why not just be honest from the start? What you did was very controlling and he was right to be rubbed the wrong way by it. You could've even told him you'd rather he puts that money towards paying you back instead of spending more. It sounds like he knows he needs help and would've listened to you.", "YTA, If he owes you money then ask him to pay or refuse to buy him the ticket, don\u2019t lie. What is even the point of a relationship where you have to scam your way into getting paid back.", "YTA. Why is he even ur boyfriend? are u gonna venmo each other  for the rest of ur life? U seem cheap cheap", "YTA. Why? You lied. You betrayed his trust. He wanted to see you and instead of that you put it towards his debts and now he doesn't have money to see you. I know people in an LDR and if one of them did something like this, it would be the end of the relationship. If you don't have trust, you don't have a relationship. Period.", "NTA. This should be an effective reality check for him to get his priorities in order.", "YTA. If you were my partner you\u2019d be single. What you did was dishonest and manipulative, and you\u2019re incredibly condescending about your bf.", "YTA", "YTA - only for taking the money in the first place. He\u2019s dumb for thinking he was gonna fly out with only 80 bucks left for the trip and the rest of the forenight but you clearly know him and know he\u2019s dumb with money. Why betray him on top of that?", "YTA. You lied and manipulated him to get your money back.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is the reason he was spending the money was to come and spend time with you. Yes money is important, but so is spending quality time and making memories with your S/O. Why be in the relationship at all if you are constantly away for work, don\u2019t want to spend money on activities and are going to lie to benefit financially? I say this because I dated someone for a long time who worked (as did I) but hated spending money on eating out, travelling, going to movies or events etc and it sucked. If spending time together isn\u2019t a good use of money, then what\u2019s the point?", "YTA\n\nBecause you tricked him, once you start doing this shit it's going to make the relationship tense and you guys will start getting petty to each other, but don't lend him any money ever again, he isn't paying you off properly or making it a priority.", "INFO: Why are you with a man who can't manage his own money? \n\nTentative YTA: don't lie to anyone about their money.", "YTA\n\nYou lied.\n\nYou need to take a hard look at your plan here. He is never going to be responsible with money. He has demonstrated that to you many times. You can't manipulate him into it. If you can't deal with the way he spends, this relationship isn't going to work. (Not saying that you should put up with his insane spending. I wouldn't either.)", "YTA", "NTA.\n\nAs a decades-long dog lover but also a realist, I\u2019d really recommend you check out the Puppy101 sub posts for a while before you get a puppy when you\u2019re also trying to get pregnant?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
