I think ESH on the question you've asked.\n\nIt sounds alot like the situation with my ex partner where he'd get angry when I paid for things as it was immasculating for him. Then he'd get angry if I didn't pay for things since I was then taking advantage of him and not understanding of his financial difficulties.

He is not a child, and your relationship dynamic is pretty weird if you\u2019re lying to him to teach him a lesson about budgeting. He needs to make these decisions and learn how to manage his money independently and in the end he can spend it how he likes.

He's irresponsible and should pay his debts before spending money on vacations.  Once you're paid off, please get rid of this guy. He obviously needs help with controlling his finances, but he needs to get that from a professional because your attempts to help him aren't working.  His insistence on spending a bunch of money to make memories is ridiculous. There are so many free activities and events places that don't require you to spend anything to enjoy them.  You can even pack a picnic and go to a park and the only cost is the food and gas/public transit/Uber fare.  He needs to learn to live within his means or let him go into debt on his own without you there to clean up his mess.  You don't want to be tied to someone for life who will end up bankrupting you and ruining your credit.  Better to get your money and get out now.", "I agree with this. From the sounds of it, he sent it before OP had a chance to respond, though telling him the price of the ticket does imply a few things. He lacks the foresight to consider that a trip costs more than just the ticket, and I do think what OP did, while bordering slightly assholey, was a wake-up call he deserved.\n\nI disagree with not buying a few nice little things while you owe a debt (like some of the other responses say, and I don't think something like a trip/holiday is a 'little' thing), that sounds to me like it's bordering on when avocado toast and coffee is blamed for people being unable to buy a house, but to allow for that kind of thing I do think OP should discuss a regular payment plan with her boyfriend to get the rest of the debt paid off, because that will prioritise paying off the debt before the other things but allow room for the other things too.\n\nI am curious if he's neurodivergent. Some of my friends with ADHD say it's a common issue for people who have that\u2014I'm not justifying it if it does happen to be this, I just honestly wouldn't be surprised if it was a contributing factor. I struggled a lot with this kind of thing in my early 20s, I have a few ND diagnoses, so I wouldn't be sure which one was probably contributing, but I am much better at managing my finances now after I became more aware of myself and worked at it.
