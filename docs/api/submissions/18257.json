You have someone who wants to spend time with you and do all these things with you and you\u2019re complaining about it. If you have an issue with him spending money, instead of complaining about it, make a budget sheet for him. Teach him how to be better with money. And give him a strict budget of how much he could spend on a monthly basis, and tell him to find budget friendly activities to do together. Your bf needs guidance. You can tell his love language is quality time and he probably believes that he needs to find things to do constantly so you\u2019re not bored.

It has been almost 10 YEARS since then and he has still not paid back the family member. Maybe $1500 has been paid back. Yet over the years he's bought outrageous things like a $2000 drone and a $4000 inferred scope and numerous hunting rifles yet cant afford to pay back this family member what he owes even at like $50 a week or whatever. Always claims he has no spare money. Currently he is in another position where he has no job (he got cut off of workers comp for faking) and cant pay his rent. My dad has recently (like last week) moved in with him as a temporary place while he decides where he is moving to and brother expects Dad to pay all his rent and that he will write down what dad pays and pay him back \"when he is on his feet again\". All of us know he wont ever pay him back.

If you're going to stay with him, you need to step back and let him manage his own finances and if he fails and doesn't have the money to do stuff with you, like trips, then that's his problems.

I can't fault you for that, I did the same, just handled it differently. Everyone, even people with limited budgets deserve to do something for relaxation and not just skimp and save. If you are concerned about the amount it costs, find cheaper variants of the stuff you want to share. Also you cannot fault him for wanting to go to a concert as he still owes you money but also want him to cospend on a holiday which arguably is more expensive.

Your arrangement with him might differ-- if you actually have one. \n\nI know your end-goal is to teach him to use his money wisely, but your bait-and-switch tactic is not okay.
