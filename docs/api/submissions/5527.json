It was the day of the party and everything was going well, until I was done blowing the candles out. My little cousin decided to take the candles out, I thought it was just so the cake can be cut, but instead she pushed my head against the cake.

She started crying because I was being harsh. Her mom told me that she was just a little kid (she\u2019s 15) having fun and that I took it too seriously.

Fifteen is NOT a \u201clittle kid\u201d.  That\u2019s full-fledged teenager in freaking HIGH SCHOOL.  She pulled a nasty trick on you and got all \u201csurprised\u201d when you became mad?
