He has a 4 year old toddler, we parent her together for the most part. \n\nMy issue is on weekends when he wakes up -by choice, since she is very good at independent play in her room until she SEES US out of bed- and gets out of bed, toddler wakes up, also, and Naturally, wants to hang with him.

Caring for a child is the priority and he needs to be doing that. Your glasses analogy was perfect", "NTA.  When he is the \"parent on duty\" (e.g., when you are sleeping), he needs to be wearing his hearing aids. Additionally, when you are sleeping, it is only polite to you to try to keep the house quiet so you can rest, and that can't happen if he is not wearing them.  Maybe a discussion is needed about who \"gets to\" sleep when, and if it's your time to sleep, he wears the hearing aids to help you have quiet while you sleep.", "NTA. I don\u2019t buy the not getting the aid wet narrative. It seems a little bit neglectful to purposefully avoid hearing your toddler.", "NTA. I get wanting to be able to take some time off from a toddler, but ultimately he is a parent first, and it's not appropriate to foist her off onto someone else and/or let her remain a problem for his partner, all while feigning ignorance of the issue at hand.\n\nCan you stop sleeping in the same home?\n\nAn afterthought - for for curiosity's sake, what's his plan if his kid starts having an emergency when he's taking his weekend morning quiet time? (I'm not hard of hearing or a parent and am genuinely curious - not trying to be snarky.)", "Info: Have y'all attempted to teach the toddler non-verbal ways of getting partner's attention/are there attempts to redirect her towards those when one of you notices her calling out for him repeatedly?", "NTA  \nI do understand that maybe your partner is enjoying his quiet alone time in the morning and I can see why he'd want a few minutes without worrying about what's going on around him, but he's kind of got a job to do too. I'd say you should just tap him to get his attention, but I guess that wouldn't solve the problem of his daughter needing to speak louder while she's interacting with him with his hearing aids out, still making it harder for you to sleep in.  \nI'm not saying your boyfriend is exactly TA in this situation, just that he is probably the one who needs to make the compromise. Getting enough sleep is really important and if you keep this up you're gonna get cranky. Thats not good for anyone!", "NTA.  I usually 'put my ears in' after I shower.  BUT I shower within a few minutes of waking up. \n\nIf I'm going to be getting up to let the dog out and chill a bit before showering I wear them. If i have to deal with my kids I wear them. It also means that sometimes you accidentally get in the shower wearing them. It's generally ok if you haven't had your head under the water too long.\n\nI hate taking off my hearing aids in the bathroom  - the risk of damage is really high so I avoid it where possible.  I have a case in the bathroom to pop them in and always make sure the loo lid is down and the plug is in the plug hole. I also have a reminder sharpied on the glass to 'check my ears are out'.\n\nI really try to avoid taking them off unless it's in my room and they can go straight in their case.  I bet your BF is the same and I get it.  However, when you have to deal with your kids you put the bloody things in and mitigate the risks.\n\nGet him a case to keep them safe in the bathroom - write a reminder on the shower to check.", "NTA but you should consider training your daughter on how to communicate with her father when his hearing aid is off. Basic really for a child with a deaf parent. It'll be useful.", "NTA but you both need to teach her non-verbal ways to get his attention.", "NTA The child is his child and he needs to be the primary carer, so he needs to work out what to do to make 100% sure that his child is safe and has a way of getting his attention if they need to. That's not on you. I think he has just gotten blase about it because you are there to be the in-between. Maybe go away for a few days and ask him to realign himself with his parental responsibilities instead of relying on you.", "NTA however I get his point of view, the hearing aids are water resistant, not water proof, they still have a chance to fail because of being exposed to water a bunch, he shouldn't have to have his hearing aids in 24/7 But!  Most kids will want a parents attention, I don't know how long you have been together but at some point if yall get serious his daughter will become your daughter, maybe also try to step in when she's asking him for simple things or give her the attention she's lacking from the father to bond with her that would be a great way to help curb her insesant questions when the daughter feels acknowlage by someone, that doesn't have to be dad. I would actually bring that up with him though and how her not being able to communicate with him properly will impact his daughter and she's clearly already being effected by his actions, he needs to be mindful that his hearing aids are not just a tool for himself, but for those around him as well.", "Teach the daughter to flash a light to get his attention if he refuses to wear his aids. If she can\u2019t reach the light switch, then use a flashlight. \n\nAlso, does he use ASL? Maybe the family can learn ASL together to improve overall communication. \n\nI think it\u2019s a valid point to say, \u201cWhat if there was an emergency and you couldn\u2019t hear it?\u201d", "INFO: Why doesn't your partner put in his hearing aids? If it's because of irritation or other adverse effects, maybe y'all should come up with and teach the toddler non verbal ways of getting your partners attention.\n\nOf it's to tune out the kid, NTA. Give your partner a (not forceful) shale or shove when kid starts to make noise, put in some earplugs and go back to sleep.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
