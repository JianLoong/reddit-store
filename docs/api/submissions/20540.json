Caring for a child is the priority and he needs to be doing that. Your glasses analogy was perfect", "NTA.  When he is the \"parent on duty\" (e.g., when you are sleeping), he needs to be wearing his hearing aids. Additionally, when you are sleeping, it is only polite to you to try to keep the house quiet so you can rest, and that can't happen if he is not wearing them.  Maybe a discussion is needed about who \"gets to\" sleep when, and if it's your time to sleep, he wears the hearing aids to help you have quiet while you sleep.", "NTA. I don\u2019t buy the not getting the aid wet narrative. It seems a little bit neglectful to purposefully avoid hearing your toddler.", "NTA. I get wanting to be able to take some time off from a toddler, but ultimately he is a parent first, and it's not appropriate to foist her off onto someone else and/or let her remain a problem for his partner, all while feigning ignorance of the issue at hand.\n\nCan you stop sleeping in the same home?\n\nAn afterthought - for for curiosity's sake, what's his plan if his kid starts having an emergency when he's taking his weekend morning quiet time?

I'd say you should just tap him to get his attention, but I guess that wouldn't solve the problem of his daughter needing to speak louder while she's interacting with him with his hearing aids out, still making it harder for you to sleep in.  \nI'm not saying your boyfriend is exactly TA in this situation, just that he is probably the one who needs to make the compromise. Getting enough sleep is really important and if you keep this up you're gonna get cranky. Thats not good for anyone!", "NTA.  I usually 'put my ears in' after I shower.  BUT I shower within a few minutes of waking up. \n\nIf I'm going to be getting up to let the dog out and chill a bit before showering I wear them. If i have to deal with my kids I wear them. It also means that sometimes you accidentally get in the shower wearing them. It's generally ok if you haven't had your head under the water too long.\n\nI hate taking off my hearing aids in the bathroom  - the risk of damage is really high so I avoid it where possible.  I have a case in the bathroom to pop them in and always make sure the loo lid is down and the plug is in the plug hole. I also have a reminder sharpied on the glass to 'check my ears are out'.\n\nI really try to avoid taking them off unless it's in my room and they can go straight in their case.  I bet your BF is the same and I get it.  However, when you have to deal with your kids you put the bloody things in and mitigate the risks.\n\nGet him a case to keep them safe in the bathroom - write a reminder on the shower to check.", "NTA but you should consider training your daughter on how to communicate with her father when his hearing aid is off. Basic really for a child with a deaf parent. It'll be useful.", "NTA but you both need to teach her non-verbal ways to get his attention.", "NTA The child is his child and he needs to be the primary carer, so he needs to work out what to do to make 100% sure that his child is safe and has a way of getting his attention if they need to. That's not on you. I think he has just gotten blase about it because you are there to be the in-between. Maybe go away for a few days and ask him to realign himself with his parental responsibilities instead of relying on you.", "NTA however I get his point of view, the hearing aids are water resistant, not water proof, they still have a chance to fail because of being exposed to water a bunch, he shouldn't have to have his hearing aids in 24/7 But!  Most kids will want a parents attention, I don't know how long you have been together but at some point if yall get serious his daughter will become your daughter, maybe also try to step in when she's asking him for simple things or give her the attention she's lacking from the father to bond with her that would be a great way to help curb her insesant questions when the daughter feels acknowlage by someone, that doesn't have to be dad. I would actually bring that up with him though and how her not being able to communicate with him properly will impact his daughter and she's clearly already being effected by his actions, he needs to be mindful that his hearing aids are not just a tool for himself, but for those around him as well.", "Teach the daughter to flash a light to get his attention if he refuses to wear his aids. If she can\u2019t reach the light switch, then use a flashlight. \n\nAlso, does he use ASL?

In his case, that includes hearing aids.", "Thanks! We are really lucky with a toddler who largely lets us sleep in til we are ready to get up, so we don\u2019t have to take turns. He just likes to get up.", "No, haha, we live together/ long term, serious relationship. \n\nHis plan is probably that I will hear her. (I would. It\u2019s a small apartment, and I am a light sleeper.)", "Mild ESH I think - as a Deaf person that uses hearing aids, I don't always wear them either. Hearing aids may be \"as waterproof as an iPhone\" -- true they've come long ways toward that since the day they were invented, but you really DON'T want to put your hearing aids near anything wet if you can prevent it.  The risk of damaging a thousand+dollar piece of equipment is just not worth it.  \n\nWhy can't you wear earplugs or use white noise to block the sound?  Close the door/insulate better? Granted, he should also be aware of the level of noise to be considerate, but saying it is a problem solely caused by Dad is not the whole picture.   \n\nIf she's old enough to independent play, get treats, use the bathroom etc as you say, she's old enough to begin using more appropriate methods of getting attention.  \"Daddy can't hear you very well, so you need to tap his arm and make sure he's looking at you before you say anything. Just yelling DADDY doesn't work very well does it? And it bothers other people. Indoor voices.\" \n\nI work with DHH preschoolers as young as age 3.  They can and do learn which people in their environment can be spoken to, and which they need to use other methods (waving hands, tapping) to get appropriate attention, and they know that yelling/speaking loudly isn't acceptable either.", "NTA. Your partner is being selfish and rude to you and to his toddler. He has, readily available to him, a way to hear her, and to hear you. But he chooses not to use the solution that is readily available to him, because he's perfectly satisfied not being able to hear the two of you. \n\nSome years ago, I finally convinced my elderly mother to start wearing hearing aids when I figured out to tell her that it wasn't about *her* \u2014 it was about me, and everyone else in her life, and the difficulty we had trying to communicate with her. I explained that I sometimes just decided not to talk with her about things because it was so hard to communicate. Our conversations had gradually diminished because I really disliked talking with her because I always had to yell and repeat myself repeatedly. She had been happy turning up the TV volume to 11 and asking people to repeat themselves.\n\nYour partner is willing to deliberately annoy you and allow his daughter to wake you up with her attempts to get his attention \u2014 because he has to wash his face, at some unspecified point in the day? That's rude AF. Perhaps he'll wake up to the situation if you explain to him that *his own daughter* will ultimately get tired of trying to talk to him and eventually stop talking to him. She's only 4 now, but it won't be long before she figures out that **daddy doesn't care enough about her to wear his hearing aids.**", "I'm sorry but - as a Deaf person, that's not at all the take you want to be pushing on someone. \"It's too difficult for us so YOU need to do something!\" Charming.  \n\nThe last line \"daddy doesn't care enough to wear his hearing aids\" is unnecessarily damaging.  I highly doubt the man is doing it because he doesn't care about his daughter.  According to OP, he's concerned about the equipment getting wet. Granted he could shower at another time (when?)", "Daddy not caring enough about his daughter to wear his hearing aids is pretty darn damaging. Daughter will notice. Daddy doesn't seem to care.\n\nIf you're a deaf person whose hearing can't be improved sufficiently with hearing aids to have regular spoken conversations, that's one thing. But if you have the ability to hear normally by the simple act of wearing hearing aids but choose not to wear your hearing aids because you might wash your face at some point, and expect the rest of the world to accommodate you, that's on you, and you shouldn't be surprised when the world doesn't accommodate you.\n\nAs one person commented earlier, I don't expect my husband to do all my seeing for me because I don't want to wear my glasses. And I shouldn't expect him to do all my hearing for me if I don't want to wear hearing aids.", "There's a nuance there that some people don't realize.  Just having the hearing aids in just means you can hear more - doesn't mean you can fully understand it. And the risk of damaging hearing aids isn't worth it, versus taking the developmentally-appropriate and necessary route of teaching the child the right way to interact with Dad.  \"Not caring enough\" is NOT what's happening here. You're projecting negativity on the guy when it's unnecessary.  \n\nThe kids I work with don't get offended or think we're ignoring them on purpose if we fail to respond to them - they learn to find appropriate communication methods.  Speaking louder is not one of them (and they are reminded of this).  If a deaf 3 and 4 year old can learn this with multiple people (peers and adults) in their environment on a periodic basis as with this toddler, SHE can learn too. \n\nOf course in the meantime it's fine for OP to have a polite conversation about how disruptive it is, and work together to teach the daughter about indoor voices and appropriate attention methods, but acting like it's malicious on Dad's behalf and that the toddler will be \"damaged\" (for life?, that's your implication) by the simple act of failure to communicate.  If that's how OP frames it in their conversation, and acts with Dad (Getting frustrated for failing to answer etc) then yes the daughter will see it as negative.  Get ahead of that and things will be fine. Get dad to schedule his showers at a time when OP is already awake. Sure.  But insisting that the only and best solution is just put your hearing aids in puts all the responsibility and blame on the Deaf person, when they aren't the only and actual full reason why OP is disrupted.", "So you'd rather put all the responsibility and blame on the 4-year-old for trying to get daddy's attention and actually, you know, talk to daddy like 4-year-olds do?\n\nOP wrote: \"I\u2019m just doing the thing she\u2019s asking him to do in the first place which gets annoying to just be the default of me doing the things cos **he doesn\u2019t hear her so she gives up and asks me.**\" The kid is already learning that she can't talk to daddy. If daddy doesn't get his head out of his ass, the kid will stop talking to him altogether, because he never hears her because he doesn't care enough to put his damn hearing aids in.\n\nIt's not a big deal to take out the hearing aids when he's getting ready to shower or wash his face. That's a lame excuse. It sounds like daddy just likes his quiet time in the morning and is happy for his kid and his partner to get frustrated and annoyed with him."]}
