Not gonna lie, in an emotional situation, when that's all the information you've been given, I can completely understand why you understand that to mean she had already passed, or would pass as soon as life support was turned off. \n\nYou say your Mum passed a day after being taken off life support. My friends Grandma had a similar situation, they made the decision to switch off life support, so everyone expected her to die pretty soon after that. And her Grandma hung around for another week before passing. Do you really believe your sister-in-law deliberately told you your Mum had passed because she expected your Mum to be alive when you arrived? Medical staff can't accurately predict how long patients will stick around after life support is turned off, but your SIL can?\n\n\nAnd to be honest, it sounds like your SIL was the only reason you were informed of the situation and arrived in time to get that extra day to say goodbye to your Mum. Your brothers weren't being very communicative to her or to you.

But his anger was the only thing strong enough to distract him from the pain of grief.\n\nAll that is to say; you will need to move beyond anger, onto the other stages of grief. Eventually.

I am so glad he got there in time to say goodbye.", "Sounds like SIL misunderstood the situation. Having never experienced this particular situation, I too would assume being taken off life support = death in a few minutes. I know better now. Doesn't look like SIL was trying to be malicious", "The more power to you. Death of a loved one can often lead to realizations about what\u2019s truly important. It may be time to trust your instincts and cut ties with SIL, as much as possible.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "That's very understandable given your loss. In a way, you may feel like you lost your mother twice, and mourned her in two different ways. \n\nFirst, you went through the unexpected sucker punch of thinking she was gone in a millisecond. You spent two hours stuck in traffic, alone, trying to process something so heartbreaking. I can't imagine all the directions your mind must have tried to go in an effort to stay focused enough to get to the hospital. \n\nYou finally get there, and I can't say what you might have thought you saw when you entered that room, because it feels cruel to put it into words as an outsider. The rug gets pulled out from under you when you discover she hadn't passed. Yet another sucker punch. Now you start to mourn in a different way while you were with her.\n\nWhen life takes something big from us, such as a beloved family member, it's not uncommon to think of how unfair the world can be. The \"why\" of it all tends to become a massive weight on our minds. Mourning is different for everyone, but anger can be a part of it. We want to scream to let out the hurt inside. Sometimes, we need something, anything, to direct that anger towards; somewhere more tangible than yelling into the void. For you, it's your SIL. \n\nI'm not trying to tell you you're wrong for feeling how you feel; I'm trying to tell you it's normal. I don't expect you to start beating yourself up over it, because that would only add to the internal maelstrom. Distance is the smart choice, because it keeps you from saying something that might cause long-term problems within your family. I don't think you'd want to cause your SIL pain either, even if things have already been rocky. You're following the age-old advice of \"if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\"\n\nI'm not trying to invalidate your emotions, but I have to say, your SIL may have truly thought your mom had passed. Before losing my grandparents, I thought taking someone off life support meant they passed right away.  I'd only really seen it portrayed on TV prior to that, and it was always quick. Your SIL may have been similarly ignorant. \n\nRight now, you need to focus on healing yourself. If possible, therapy could be of great assistance, especially grief counseling. When you're in a better place, you can consider what your relationship with your SIL should look like.\n\nI'm truly sorry for your loss \ud83d\udc9c", "Can I just say, I\u2019m blown away that you\u2019ve done that course to help people while you\u2019re grieving. That\u2019s an absolutely amazing thing to do, so huge props to you. \n\nAlso, NTA. At such an emotional time, each step and word has an impact. To actually use the most impactful words when that wasn\u2019t the case compounds the grief and situation for you. You\u2019re in shock, grieving and panicking. You get there and you\u2019re even more in shock, hopeful regardless, despondent when you realise you are definitely losing her, then grief stricken all over again. All she actually had to do was tell you that you needed to get to the hospital asap because there\u2019d been complications with your mum\u2019s surgery, and your brother couldn\u2019t answer the phone because they were with her and no phones were allowed. \n\nHaving gone through so many emotions, thought processes, and the loss, I think you doing the mental health responder course is even more commendable."]}
