It may be time to trust your instincts and cut ties with SIL, as much as possible.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "That's very understandable given your loss. In a way, you may feel like you lost your mother twice, and mourned her in two different ways. \n\nFirst, you went through the unexpected sucker punch of thinking she was gone in a millisecond. You spent two hours stuck in traffic, alone, trying to process something so heartbreaking. I can't imagine all the directions your mind must have tried to go in an effort to stay focused enough to get to the hospital. \n\nYou finally get there, and I can't say what you might have thought you saw when you entered that room, because it feels cruel to put it into words as an outsider. The rug gets pulled out from under you when you discover she hadn't passed. Yet another sucker punch. Now you start to mourn in a different way while you were with her.\n\nWhen life takes something big from us, such as a beloved family member, it's not uncommon to think of how unfair the world can be. The \"why\" of it all tends to become a massive weight on our minds. Mourning is different for everyone, but anger can be a part of it. We want to scream to let out the hurt inside. Sometimes, we need something, anything, to direct that anger towards; somewhere more tangible than yelling into the void. For you, it's your SIL. \n\nI'm not trying to tell you you're wrong for feeling how you feel; I'm trying to tell you it's normal. I don't expect you to start beating yourself up over it, because that would only add to the internal maelstrom. Distance is the smart choice, because it keeps you from saying something that might cause long-term problems within your family. I don't think you'd want to cause your SIL pain either, even if things have already been rocky. You're following the age-old advice of \"if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\"\n\nI'm not trying to invalidate your emotions, but I have to say, your SIL may have truly thought your mom had passed. Before losing my grandparents, I thought taking someone off life support meant they passed right away.  I'd only really seen it portrayed on TV prior to that, and it was always quick. Your SIL may have been similarly ignorant. \n\nRight now, you need to focus on healing yourself. If possible, therapy could be of great assistance, especially grief counseling.

To actually use the most impactful words when that wasn\u2019t the case compounds the grief and situation for you. You\u2019re in shock, grieving and panicking. You get there and you\u2019re even more in shock, hopeful regardless, despondent when you realise you are definitely losing her, then grief stricken all over again. All she actually had to do was tell you that you needed to get to the hospital asap because there\u2019d been complications with your mum\u2019s surgery, and your brother couldn\u2019t answer the phone because they were with her and no phones were allowed. \n\nHaving gone through so many emotions, thought processes, and the loss, I think you doing the mental health responder course is even more commendable.", "NAH\n\nFor the reasons others have outlined: high emotional times, unlikely malice intended, grief and loss etc.\n\nBut your workplace needs an \u201cin case of emergencies\u201d number to contact in life/death situations just like this. \n\nFamily had tried to contact you 13 times and hadn\u2019t been able to get hold of you (reasonably given the work you do) but you had to call SIL after trying the missed call numbers and not being able to get hold of them.

Sorry but everyone saying they would have assumed the same that withdrawing life support meant instant death is just plain ignorant.

But then again I wouldn\u2019t want her to die without me there...\n\nPersonally I would\u2019ve spent that day in the hospital telling my mom I loved her and would miss her, not seething, but everyone reacts differently to death.", "SIL should still have apologised once her mistake became clear.", "I am trying to make the world a better place once comment at a time. :-D", "Yeah, i understand, with your explanation. And i totally get your frustuation. I also don't want to defend your SIL (if she wasn't sure she could have totally asked for the clarification). \n\nI'm just saying, that if i was told \"we are removing him from life support\" that essentially means dead in minutes. That's how my grandfather died.", "What would you have done differently if she had said she\u2019s dying not dead ?", "I think people who haven\u2019t experienced it don\u2019t know what being taken off life support means. When my grandpa died the hospital stressed that the whole thing could take hours to a day because most people think it happens right away but it doesn\u2019t.", "Anger is easier than grief. It seems like your holding on to this anger so hard because it is masking your grief.", "Except OP says in a comment they are upset they didn\u2019t bring something to keep them busy with while waiting. \n\nThey\u2019ve never said anything regarding feeling was robbed of the chance to say goodbye then the emotional response to finding out they still could.  In fact they just say they were scared and mad.", "I think part of this is that, even if your mother WERE already dead, she took it upon herself to tell you.\n\nI would never take it upon myself to tell my husband's sister about their mom's death- I would leave that to him. The most I might say is that things look bad and to get to the hospital ASAP- Then I would tell my husband that he has to contact his sister NOW. \n\nIf my sister in law was the one to tell me about the death of my parent, I would feel pretty uncomfortable with that. I'd rather have that news from siblings. \n\nNTA obviously. I'm very sorry about the loss of your mother, and clearly your SIL (who apparently has a history of catastrophizing to get attention) massively fucked up.", "Not jumped a mile at the sight of my dead mother moving", "Then it wasnt her place to make the call - and all she had to do was relay the exact wording about life support. And if she didn't know how she could get a nurse to explain it.", " The lie was cruel.", "They stated the time it took was slow due to distance and traffic.", "You need someone to be there for you. A counselor.\n\nI'm sorry, this is a horrible situation, and watching your mother die in front of you was horrible.\n\nBut- gently- your sister in law's interpretation of what was happening is same (incorrect) interpretation that most people have. We often as humans equate \"taking off life support\" with dying. It's a difficult thing to have to learn about, that it is more of a process.\n\nYou're holding onto anger that is going to keep you from your family. But she related the facts as well as she knew them at the time, in a high pressure situation for her too. She messed up, but her mess up is a really common interpretation of what she didn't understand in the moment.\n\nYour shock makes sense. Your anger makes sense. But you need to start to work through them.\n\nAnd- again I say this gently- while you are acutely grieving your mother's sudden death is no time to be \"the grief guy\" at work. I'm not saying that you are not being kind, but right now you have no perspective on what you are going through. You know how I know that? You're asking for advice on how to keep a resentment going on AITA. That's not a healthy move in grief, at all. This is not a place that can tenderly hold your broken heart and help you heal. \n\nPlease find your own counselor. I wish you the best. I'm so, so sorry that the events surrounding your mom's last days were so confusing and painful. I'm so sorry that you lost her.", "The point she\u2019s making is, SIL didn\u2019t know it was a lie. She was confused about what she had been told and made an assumption that ended up being false, but it wasn\u2019t malicious, it was a mistake.", "She may have been confused, but once her mistake was clear she should have apologised."]}
