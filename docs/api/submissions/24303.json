It may be time to trust your instincts and cut ties with SIL, as much as possible.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "That's very understandable given your loss. In a way, you may feel like you lost your mother twice, and mourned her in two different ways. \n\nFirst, you went through the unexpected sucker punch of thinking she was gone in a millisecond. You spent two hours stuck in traffic, alone, trying to process something so heartbreaking. I can't imagine all the directions your mind must have tried to go in an effort to stay focused enough to get to the hospital. \n\nYou finally get there, and I can't say what you might have thought you saw when you entered that room, because it feels cruel to put it into words as an outsider. The rug gets pulled out from under you when you discover she hadn't passed. Yet another sucker punch. Now you start to mourn in a different way while you were with her.\n\nWhen life takes something big from us, such as a beloved family member, it's not uncommon to think of how unfair the world can be. The \"why\" of it all tends to become a massive weight on our minds. Mourning is different for everyone, but anger can be a part of it. We want to scream to let out the hurt inside. Sometimes, we need something, anything, to direct that anger towards; somewhere more tangible than yelling into the void. For you, it's your SIL. \n\nI'm not trying to tell you you're wrong for feeling how you feel; I'm trying to tell you it's normal. I don't expect you to start beating yourself up over it, because that would only add to the internal maelstrom. Distance is the smart choice, because it keeps you from saying something that might cause long-term problems within your family. I don't think you'd want to cause your SIL pain either, even if things have already been rocky. You're following the age-old advice of \"if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\"\n\nI'm not trying to invalidate your emotions, but I have to say, your SIL may have truly thought your mom had passed. Before losing my grandparents, I thought taking someone off life support meant they passed right away.  I'd only really seen it portrayed on TV prior to that, and it was always quick. Your SIL may have been similarly ignorant. \n\nRight now, you need to focus on healing yourself. If possible, therapy could be of great assistance, especially grief counseling.

To actually use the most impactful words when that wasn\u2019t the case compounds the grief and situation for you. You\u2019re in shock, grieving and panicking. You get there and you\u2019re even more in shock, hopeful regardless, despondent when you realise you are definitely losing her, then grief stricken all over again. All she actually had to do was tell you that you needed to get to the hospital asap because there\u2019d been complications with your mum\u2019s surgery, and your brother couldn\u2019t answer the phone because they were with her and no phones were allowed. \n\nHaving gone through so many emotions, thought processes, and the loss, I think you doing the mental health responder course is even more commendable.", "NAH\n\nFor the reasons others have outlined: high emotional times, unlikely malice intended, grief and loss etc.\n\nBut your workplace needs an \u201cin case of emergencies\u201d number to contact in life/death situations just like this. \n\nFamily had tried to contact you 13 times and hadn\u2019t been able to get hold of you (reasonably given the work you do) but you had to call SIL after trying the missed call numbers and not being able to get hold of them.

Sorry but everyone saying they would have assumed the same that withdrawing life support meant instant death is just plain ignorant.

But eventually I started feeling better and most of my anger has gone away.\n\nI\u2019m wondering how much of your anger doesn\u2019t have to do with your SIL? How much of your anger is just due to your mother being gone?", "If the \"worst example\" seems to be something that most people are interpreting as a pretty simple misunderstanding (heck, I would be surprised to learn that someone was alive numerous hours after being taken off live support when they were struggling with life support, which seems to be the case here), this really sounds a lot like misplaced emotions. \n\nWhich doesn't mean you need to forgive the SIL or be friends with her or any such thing; lots of times two people just have clashing personalities, which is entirely normal and fine. That said, this might mean that these emotions aren't actually rational at the moment, which is entirely standard when confronting the death of a parent.", "You publicly snubbed her.  People will be asking her what happened.  \n\nHer side won\u2019t sound awful to the average off Reddit human.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you were scared to see your mother move but nobody is going to believe your SIL tried play a bad early Halloween prank on you.", "Anger is a part of the grieving process", "Haha", "Nobody needs to believe it was a prank because it wasn't. It was her wanting to be some part of what was happening in the hospital.", "I have been in an unexpected loss situation like this, where everyone was at the hospital and tensions were running high. It really tore apart the family for a while. People were in a highly emotional state, and some people made mistakes or said things they didn\u2019t truly mean. I was the outsider/in law in the situation, and luckily didn\u2019t do anything to make people mad at me, but I could have very easily been the target. Some people have never forgiven each other for things that happened 5 years ago at this point. It\u2019s still hurtful for the family. \n\nYou are absolutely justified in feeling upset at being told incorrect information. I would just caution you not to hold onto the anger for too long. No one in those situations is acting rationally.", "At a certain age, that begins to get more and more common. It just sucks losing a parent, and nobody can really prepare for it.", "It absolutely is.  But I don\u2019t think OP is recognizing this for what it is.", "OP was unreachable. The siblings were occupied, and the cell reception was shitty. Yeah SIL could have worded that better, but it wasn't malicious. Doesn't make her the AH", "She didn\u2019t even call him at that time OP called her", "But you called her to ask what was going on?", "One can be result in another. Because you basically starting making peace with a close one dying, and then you have to go through that again.", "Did OP even communicate to the SIL why they are angry? All they wrote here was they refused a hug and a handshake. I'm not a mind reader, this wouldn't be enough information for me to go on", "Want I would consider normal is to not tell a person over the phone that their loved one died. It should have been her brother telling her in person, since OP was only 2 hours away, not \u201cmain character\u201d SIL. OP should\u2019ve been told there were complications from the surgery and to come to the hospital immediately.", "NTA \nAs someone who just lost their mother a few months ago, my heart goes out to you.\n\nAnd if I was you, I would have slapped that SIL and told your bothers what she did.\n\nThats cold hearted and borderline psychotic.", "NTA but what was the reason your SIL would say such a thing?", "I don't see any evidence of anything that any reasonable person would consider AH behavior, even utterly devoid of context.\n\nAnd with the context, I think that your behavior is quite reasonable.\n\nNTA.\n\nPresumably you're in a position to decide if you want to forgive your SIL or not and don't want our input, so just trust your judgment there.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry for your loss.", "I agree with everyone who's saying that there needs to be a conversation.\n\nI am envisioning a situation in which your SIL believed your mother to be dead when she contacted you.  I imagine your brother coming away from a conversation with the doctor crying and telling his wife that they'd removed life support.  Your SIL could have interpreted this to mean that your mom was dead or would be dead in seconds, as on TV when the doctors \"pull the plug\" and moments later, death occurs.  \n\nOf course, at the point when she realized that she had conveyed misinformation, SIL should have corrected it, but I imagine a very stressful, tragic scene at the hospital with everyone overwhelmed with grief, and her message to you the last thing on her mind.  (Not excusing her, but this could explain the omission in the absence of malice on her part.)\n\nIf your SIL is in general a good person, it would be great if you had it in you to talk to her about the impact of her message, give her a chance to apologize, and, if you can find it within yourself, forgive her at this very difficult time when the whole family could use each other's support.", "Esh. Did it occur to you that she had been told they were removing life support & after some time, she probably assumed she had passed? Unless it was malicious, i think its unfortunate but not uncommon. But regardless, wasnt her info to share. My neighbor told me his wife was dead, being transferred out of state for burial, and cried on my shoulder for 3 hrs. She wasnt dead. She was in hospital but not dead. So awkward when i went to express condolences to their kids.", "First up, I'm sorry for your loss :( I've been in similar situations where I have watched my aunt, granddad, dad and ex FIL die slowly over several hours.   \n\n\nYou are NTA. Your SIL could have just left it at \"Your mom is very ill, please get here asap.\". She had no right to tell you your mom was already dead. What a horrible thing to say.", "NAH, dead and dieing are very similar it also did not sound like they knew how long she would still be there.", "Another perspective to consider: If I were the SIL, I would have thought twice about blurting out \u201cyour mother\u2019s dead\u201d over the phone, even if I knew that for a fact. It\u2019s the sort of news that should be given in person and preferably by someone who shared an equally close relationship to the deceased (ie OP\u2019s brother.) In the SIL\u2019s place I\u2019d have stuck with something like \u201cyour mother is in the ICU, I don\u2019t have all the information, you should get there ASAP and speak to your brothers.\u201d However, I appreciate that it\u2019s hard to think of a well crafted answer or \u201calternate truth\u201d on the spot, especially if you don\u2019t have experience with these sorts of situations. I\u2019ll reserve judgement because I can\u2019t quite figure out whether the SIL is cruel and emotionally manipulative or just extremely dense and neurotic.", "NAH. This sounds like SIL got stuck being the one to talk to you you after life support was pulled. It's a pretty linear progression to death. She likely believed what she told you. I get you being angry but she isn't the person to be angry at for doing her best in a fraught situation.\n\nI was going to go with Y-T-A but given your grief I'm giving you a pass.", "NTA", "INFO \nDid SIL think she was dead", "Both brothers are aware because I told them when I got to the hospital.\n\nBoth don't know why she said it.", "Something only she would know. She's very rarely been called out on her bullshit so she has been used to controlling the narrative", "Thanks for your kind words", "I know what you mean but SIL has been notoriously problematic for decades.", "Seems plenty of people don't see your point of view in the comments.\n\nHence why I asked", "She was told that she was having life support withdrawn at some point.", "This is an extremely difficult situation. OP, I am sorry that you had to go through that with your family. I feel for your loss.\n\nYou mention that reception was extremely poor and that you had a hard time hearing your brother when calling. To give your sister in law the benefit of the doubt, is it possible that your sister in law misheard when she was conveyed the news by your brother? Perhaps she heard \u201coperation went aw\u2026, mom \u2026 ICU, please \u2026 call sist\u2026 to come, mom is d\u2026 urgent\u2026 right now\u2026\u201d\n\nEdit: corrected typo", "I am so surprised why I had to scroll all the way down for THIS. Massive lie?? I thought SIL just randomly messaged OP their mom died as a cruel joke, but no she clearly thought mom was dead or by the time OP came round to the hospital the mom will be dead. I'm not sure what OP wanted, \"hey OP your mom is not dead but between the realms of life and death\"", "OP IS NOT USING THE SIL AS A PUNCHING BAG AND OP IS NOT TA in this story. Her SIL is prioritizing her feelings over the grief OP is going thru. Any other person would give OP space and if she really felt complelled to speak with OP she could have written a letter. But pushing OP to resolve the conflict as the family is making funeral arrangements and wanting to speak about it at the wake is ridiculous and selfish. SIL have been wrong on so many different But levels and refuses to see it.  SIL did not tell OP the mom was in ICU and leave it at that-- that would not have been a lie. The lie was that the mom WAS DEAD.  No time of death was pronounced there was no white sheet pulled over her face, they weren't directed to the morgue to visit the mother so she was NOT DEAD prior to OP arriving at the hospital. Also if the SIL was panicking and was having trouble processing the news and passing on info she should have answered the phone explained she did not know exactly what was going on but she would find her husband or even an hospital employee to explain the details. ALSO no one wants to hear over the phone that their loved one is dead --its a reason they give the details in person to avoid someone driving erratically or emotionally compromised leading to an accident.", "\"Life support is being removed,\" isn't really that much extrapolating if you don't really understand medicine.

Didn't even stop to eat breakfast.\n\nSeveral hours later, after we'd removed all life support, she was still hanging in there. I had to eat my lunch over her while holding her hand, which was awkward in all the ways you'd think, but I didn't see how giving myself a migraine would improve matters.

Plenty of people are just like that when everyone is looking.", "What conversation?", "I'm so surprised by this thread's repeated insistence that the sister-in-law should have known to not give any details.

What's going on?", "I guess this experience is unique for every person. \n\nMy grand-father was slowly dying from cancer in front of my eyes. We were very close (he raised me), and i didn't have your experience. But each person copes differently, i guess.", "Sorry.   But I'm with SIL on this based on the information I've read thus far.  She's told mother taken off life support.  What do you think that means?  What would the average layperson think that means?  You have not established that she intentionally misled you.  Why aren't you mad at your brothers who were at the hospital WITH YOUR MOM who couldn't pick up the phone for your calls to bring you up to speed.   If reception at hospital so poor, how did your brothers reach your SIL?  Who sent 13 messages?  And from where.  No one can step out to the parking lot?  This is a poor chronology.  You are also holding your WIL to a certain standard of understanding of medical terminology and have not established that she truly understood.  You had no understanding either.   You walked in and were told oxygen was being administered for comfort measures.  Comfort measures are for the living.  Yet you were SHOCKED when you mom moved her hands.   I'm sorry to be so blunt but you are quite unfair since you made a similar mistake.   I'm very sorry for your loss and the confusion.  Just try to be  happy that mom was still alive and I could be there for her.  Good luck", "Honestly, it\u2019s totally fair for you to be angry. You heard one thing and it ended up being another. You\u2019re going to go through a whole lot of emotions and it\u2019s way better to just feel those feelings rather than push them down. \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t sound like SIL did it intentionally, so try to not direct that anger at her.

It got you to the hospital and you had loved ones there.\n\nI'm writing this as a person who missed his best friend passing while on the way to ICU. I've seen a video, and while I would have loved to make it in time, he wasn't there anymore.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA but I do understand why you feel the way you do.  \n\nYour SIL was mistaken and thought your mom already passed away. It sounds like she wasn\u2019t at the hospital so she was passing on information she got. *You were lucky* that she was mistaken and you were able to be at the hospital with your mother at the end.  \n\nHere\u2019s the thing though: your reaction is way outsized. SIL did not kill your mother and it doesn\u2019t seem like she was trying to keep you from the hospital or anything like that. You called her after not being able to get ahold of anyone else and she told you what she thought she knew. To the person who said \u201cit wasn\u2019t SIL\u2019s news to share:\u201d what should SIL have done? Say \u201csorry, keep calling your brother\u201d? That\u2019d be even more ridiculous.  \n\nI can understand why this may be your reaction though. Naturally you\u2019re grieving, and likely angry about losing your mom (a common thing with grieving).

Only experts (e. g. psychologists) can maka a diagnosis. Also, since you very clearly have a bias concerning her, I don't fully believe your narration.\n\nShe miscommunicated and you are fully aware it was not on purpose - yet you purposefully leave that out in the original post and take every opportunity to talk shit about her in the comments. You don't have to like her, but that doesn't give you the right to talk about a person that way - not even anonymously in the internet while grieving. How would you feel if someone made such assumptions (and frankly straight out insults) about you?\n\nYou seem to twist every sentence she says into something negative. She gets a cancer diagnosis and is scared because of it? She just loves the attention. She informs you about your mother based on the little knowlegde she has and it turns out to be incorrect information? Then she must be a liar, even though you KNOW she didn't do it on purpose. Btw YTA for that very misleading title alone... See, I can also twist your words and claim you were lying to us, too. Honestly, I think it doesn't even matter what she would have said to you when you reached her, you would direct your anger at her anyway.\n\nIf you are only here to rant, please go to another Subreddit. If this sick bashing of another person is your way of grieving, you should seek professional help.\n\nBe mad (or in this case sad) at the message, not the messager. This is not healthy at all. The longer you will hold on to your anger, the more nasty the situation and your feelings will get.\n\nPS in response to the hypochondriac-claim: Some doctor said, she should check her mind, when they couldn't find the cause for some of her health issues? Big deal. Doctors say such things sometimes, when they don't know the solution to a problem. They often don't think from the bottom of their heart that a person needs therapy in these situations (especially since they are not trained experts for the human mind) they just can't think of another solution. She had a cancer operation and you STILL invalidate her concerns and feeling about it in this comments section. And yet you are upset that she didn't use the right words concerning the health situation of your mother. \n\nYou are not forced to have anything to do with her and are entitled to dislike her as much as you want.
