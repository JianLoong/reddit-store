It may be time to trust your instincts and cut ties with SIL, as much as possible.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "That's very understandable given your loss. In a way, you may feel like you lost your mother twice, and mourned her in two different ways. \n\nFirst, you went through the unexpected sucker punch of thinking she was gone in a millisecond. You spent two hours stuck in traffic, alone, trying to process something so heartbreaking. I can't imagine all the directions your mind must have tried to go in an effort to stay focused enough to get to the hospital. \n\nYou finally get there, and I can't say what you might have thought you saw when you entered that room, because it feels cruel to put it into words as an outsider. The rug gets pulled out from under you when you discover she hadn't passed. Yet another sucker punch. Now you start to mourn in a different way while you were with her.\n\nWhen life takes something big from us, such as a beloved family member, it's not uncommon to think of how unfair the world can be. The \"why\" of it all tends to become a massive weight on our minds. Mourning is different for everyone, but anger can be a part of it. We want to scream to let out the hurt inside. Sometimes, we need something, anything, to direct that anger towards; somewhere more tangible than yelling into the void. For you, it's your SIL. \n\nI'm not trying to tell you you're wrong for feeling how you feel; I'm trying to tell you it's normal. I don't expect you to start beating yourself up over it, because that would only add to the internal maelstrom. Distance is the smart choice, because it keeps you from saying something that might cause long-term problems within your family. I don't think you'd want to cause your SIL pain either, even if things have already been rocky. You're following the age-old advice of \"if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\"\n\nI'm not trying to invalidate your emotions, but I have to say, your SIL may have truly thought your mom had passed. Before losing my grandparents, I thought taking someone off life support meant they passed right away.  I'd only really seen it portrayed on TV prior to that, and it was always quick. Your SIL may have been similarly ignorant. \n\nRight now, you need to focus on healing yourself. If possible, therapy could be of great assistance, especially grief counseling.

To actually use the most impactful words when that wasn\u2019t the case compounds the grief and situation for you. You\u2019re in shock, grieving and panicking. You get there and you\u2019re even more in shock, hopeful regardless, despondent when you realise you are definitely losing her, then grief stricken all over again. All she actually had to do was tell you that you needed to get to the hospital asap because there\u2019d been complications with your mum\u2019s surgery, and your brother couldn\u2019t answer the phone because they were with her and no phones were allowed. \n\nHaving gone through so many emotions, thought processes, and the loss, I think you doing the mental health responder course is even more commendable.", "NAH\n\nFor the reasons others have outlined: high emotional times, unlikely malice intended, grief and loss etc.\n\nBut your workplace needs an \u201cin case of emergencies\u201d number to contact in life/death situations just like this. \n\nFamily had tried to contact you 13 times and hadn\u2019t been able to get hold of you (reasonably given the work you do) but you had to call SIL after trying the missed call numbers and not being able to get hold of them.

Sorry but everyone saying they would have assumed the same that withdrawing life support meant instant death is just plain ignorant.
