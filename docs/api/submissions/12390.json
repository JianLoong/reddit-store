{"id": 12390, "submission_id": "11s9xbl", "title": "AITA for expecting my wife to apologize?", "selftext": "My wife of 6 years is 5 months pregnant and incredibly quick to anger since becoming pregnant. Doesn't want to be touched at all, everything makes her uncomfortable, she feels like garbage all the time, etc etc. I'm not trying to dismiss any of these changes in her because obviously she has a legitimate reason and this is typically not her usual behavior. I can see past most of this because she truly isn't taking these things out on me. She just seems pissed off a good 60% of the day. The pregnancy hasn't been particularly hard (no morning sickness at all- her biggest issues are ankle pain) but her hormones are just completely off the charts. \n\nSo basically, my needs are being completely neglected. As selfish as that sounds given the situation, it still makes me incredibly angry. I try spending time with her often. Like, let's go to the store, let's go ride around in the car, let's watch a movie, let's play video games together, etc etc. She doesn't want to do shit. Walking around a store makes her ankles hurt, sitting in a car makes her legs swell, watching movies makes her tired, playing video games gives her a screaming headache. And the more I ask her to hang out with me, the more it pisses me off because I feel like chop liver. \n\nSo basically this all came to a head over the past week. I've been begging her to come hang out with me and do something. She says she wants to but her body is just \"done\". She doesn't even try though. So I brought it up last night and I will admit that I had a tone about my voice that was very accusing because of everything and she became immediately irate. She says that she cooks every single night, she cleans 24/7, I don't do anything but run to the store for her, I don't help her do anything, me constantly nagging her for attention after she's busted her ass all day is exhausting and making her resentful because why don't I offer something that she enjoys like showering together or rubbing her swollen feet and ankles. It was just completely switched in to a \"you don't do shit for me\" argument and I truly can't tell if I'm wrong here. I slept on the couch and I won't speak to her until she apologizes to me for lashing out after expressing my feelings to her. However, my mom says my wife has a valid point because the things I want to do are things my wife isn't interested in and pushing my hobbies off on an already hormonal woman would piss her off too. AITA?\n\nETA: my wife was 100% not like this before the pregnancy. She went above and beyond to make sure my needs were being met- even if it meant playing video games with me, which she hates.", "created_utc": 1678915792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s9xbl/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_apologize/", "score": 362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Doesn't want to be touched at all, everything makes her uncomfortable, she feels like garbage all the time, etc etc. I'm not trying to dismiss any of these changes in her because obviously she has a legitimate reason and this is typically not her usual behavior. I can see past most of this because she truly isn't taking these things out on me. She just seems pissed off a good 60% of the day. The pregnancy hasn't been particularly hard (no morning sickness at all- her biggest issues are ankle pain) but her hormones are just completely off the charts. \n\nSo basically, my needs are being completely neglected. As selfish as that sounds given the situation, it still makes me incredibly angry. I try spending time with her often. Like, let's go to the store, let's go ride around in the car, let's watch a movie, let's play video games together, etc etc. She doesn't want to do shit. Walking around a store makes her ankles hurt, sitting in a car makes her legs swell, watching movies makes her tired, playing video games gives her a screaming headache. And the more I ask her to hang out with me, the more it pisses me off because I feel like chop liver. \n\nSo basically this all came to a head over the past week. I've been begging her to come hang out with me and do something. She says she wants to but her body is just \"done\". She doesn't even try though. So I brought it up last night and I will admit that I had a tone about my voice that was very accusing because of everything and she became immediately irate. She says that she cooks every single night, she cleans 24/7, I don't do anything but run to the store for her, I don't help her do anything, me constantly nagging her for attention after she's busted her ass all day is exhausting and making her resentful because why don't I offer something that she enjoys like showering together or rubbing her swollen feet and ankles. It was just completely switched in to a \"you don't do shit for me\" argument and I truly can't tell if I'm wrong here. I slept on the couch and I won't speak to her until she apologizes to me for lashing out after expressing my feelings to her.

Go apologize to your wife.", "So why don\u2019t you do any cleaning or cooking, why is it all your wife? Especially while she\u2019s pregnant? You think she\u2019s gonna be able to do all the cooking and cleaning herself after the baby arrives? Also, you sound like a needy, whiny infant. Me, me, me! Pay attention to me! What\u2019s wrong with you? You know you have an actual infant on the way who is actually going to need your wife\u2019s attention. Are you going to be angry at you wife and baby when she can\u2019t give you attention because she\u2019s taking care of the baby? \n\nAlso-what the heck do you bring to this relationship besides financially?

Why the hell would she \u201cmeet your needs\u201d. It\u2019s nothing to do with hormones, you\u2019re just an asshole and a shitty partner.

She went above and beyond to make sure my needs were being met- even if it meant playing video games with me, which she hates\"\n\nShe got tired of being the one putting the most time and effort into the relationship, she got tired of doing everything with no help and I'm sure she's also tired of your attitude", "YTA. You\u2019re focused on the wrong issue here.\n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t trust you\u2014Not in a cheating sense, but in a reliability sense. \n\nAt some point in her pregnancy, and certainly after the birth, your wife won\u2019t be able to handle this workload. You NEED to be able to handle taking care of the pets and chores primarily after the baby is born\u2014Your wife will be dealing with her own recovery.\n\nYou are both in a bad loop right now\u2014Your wife doesn\u2019t trust you to finish the chores AND things bother her more because pregnancy is messing with her hormones AND she has less energy so she powers through her tasks right after work, which in turn leaves you feeling like there\u2019s not a role for you and no way to show that you are reliable but also means that your wife has burnt through her energy by the time you are home, which in turns leaves you feeling neglected, which in turns leads to your wife viewing you as a burden and unreliable, and look, we\u2019re starting the loop all over again.\n\nYou need to adjust your expectations accordingly. Having a relatively easy pregnancy means that your wife is still struggling with pregnancy. You are the only one with the energy and ability to break this cycle.\n\nYou need to apologize \u2026 and step up. You won\u2019t have time once the baby is born to have regular hang outs with your wife. You need to view things like massaging her feet as part of bonding. You also need to have a long conversation with your wife as to what you both (but especially you) should prioritize once the baby is born and you are both in survival mode in terms of daily tasks. And you need to start actively seeing work ahead of timing and handling it so that the work isn\u2019t there for your wife to try to do.", "YTA. Just leave her alone. She is expecting a baby, that can cause suffering. You should help her out more. You should go do what SHE wants to do sometime.", "So.. you're allowed to express your feelings, but when she does, SHE has to apologize and you're actually ignoring her? \n\nYTA.

Kids are amazing, but they are about to completely flip your life on its head. There is no two ways about this, it is going to mess with you. You need to start wrapping your head around this now. Your wife will not be picking up after you. She'll resent nagging you to do things, rightly. You need to start pitching in without being asked. Grab the garbages and take them out without her telling you. Grab the vacuum when it's clearly dirty on the floor, etc.\n\nMaybe you already do things like this just be prepared to do even more. A baby is a ton of work, so either help with baby, or pick up some chores your wife usually does.\n\nI won't say you're an asshole because I get feeling neglected, but you need to start getting it through your head that things are about to change, and it will be a lot easier if you take it upon yourself.", "YTA.

I haven't slept through the night in about 4 months, my \"morning sickness\" was 3x a day for the first trimester and continued to the end of my second, would randomly get so congested I thought I was sick, etc. And the worst part is you can't partake in a lot of the things you enjoyed before. No alcohol or weed to help you unwind, gotta limit your caffeine, no Aleve or most other pain killers when you're in massive pain, now I can't even do sweets because of GD \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8", "I wonder what could possibly be making her stressed /s", "You know that pregnant women aren\u2019t supposed to clean the litter box. Step it up man. Ask your wife to give you three chores and you do them everyday. Also how much free time Dow you think you will have after the baby?", "IKR? Fatherhood's going to be a rude awakening.", "Divorce on the horizon. She should run now. Or waddle at least", "Don\u2019t forget the bones shifting to support it and let it out! *shudder*", "Hard same, I\u2019m sure if we scratched the surface that would be present too", "Thank you! It really, REALLY does. I never knew I could be so exhausted. But so happy as well.\nEdit: congratulations to you too!!! In addition to exhaustion, I have brain fog and forget how to communicate as well.", "Am I the asshole makes me so grateful for my partner. Every time I see a man post something like this thinking they're not only right, they're justified to stonewall their partner into compliance makes me grateful I got one of the good ones. \n\nPoor wifey. I'd feel like shit too if I were married to a man who doesn't take any of his wife's load off her and expects to be treated like a king for doing ???? nothing.", "Wait, this is a thing?\n\n\\*sigh\\* Of course it's a thing.", "But she isn't playing video games with him anymore even though she hates them! Clearly a need /s \ud83d\ude44", "His mom smacked his ass down instead \ud83d\ude02", "Re your last paragraph\u2026 I don\u2019t think he loves her at all. After all, he gets immense pleasure by making her do things she hates, like watching him playing video games.\n\nHis version of \u2018love\u2019 is sick.", "I wonder how long it will take her to realize, based on her current workload, that she might as well be a single parent...", "This was my first thought when I read his response!  She's probably terrified about losing this baby too.  She's only 5 months pregnant so she hasn't carried this baby to term. To me, this isn't hormones, this is grief and terror.", "Also notice how he specifically said she has had two miscarriages, that leads me to believe he doesn\u2019t have an emotional stake in any of this. Miscarriage of wanted pregnancies after traumatic and awful for all involved", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

My ex was perfect for 4 years. Then he got a job 900 miles away from where we lived/I grew up. Once he had me far away and isolated,the abuse began. How can someone pretend for 4 whole years??", "> Ask your wife to give you three chores\n\nFuck that. He\u2019s a grown man. She shouldn\u2019t need to tell him anything. Look up weaponized incompetence and stop encouraging it.", "I wouldn't be that hopeful. OP is going to be a Kodak dad *at best*. I would put my personal bet on him cheating within a month of her being post partum, if that.", "not the waddle lmao", "Me too. I had major complications after the birth of my son and my husband was basically a single father for the first three weeks (I was in the hospital). He didn\u2019t do everything necessarily the same way I would, but who cares - he kept the house in decent shape and did *everything* for our newborn.\n\nI know a lot of men who would\u2019ve just\u2026fallen apart.", "Can confirm this is a big thing. Know several guys exactly like this", "I don\u2019t think that people like that are real people. They have nothing original inside. They are like personality scavengers, collecting different character traits from people they have known over the years to assemble a personality\u2026 none of it theirs.", "So if she comes home and cleans... That means those things were left undone before you both went to work, and likely the night before...\n\nI'd bet a LOT of money that you just don't recognize what chores haven't been done on any given day, that you should be contributing to.", "You can do that on your days off.  You're doing the good ol fashioned weaponized incompetence.  Stop with the excuses and start being an actual partner.  You're acting pathetic and she's had enough.", "Quick question - do you ever thank her for this?", "And you repay her by.............. ??????? Imagine being upset that your pregnant wife isn't catering to you harder while she's pregnant while also admitting you're doing fuck all", "Oh, dude... do you even hear yourself? You are acting like a demanding child.\n\nAt some point, you need to recognise that running a household together means more than just bringing home a paycheck. Up the ante, dude, you are failing at being a contributing partner here.", "YTA and your full of really bad excuses. You are an absolute crap partner.", "Why don\u2019t you ever do anything for your Wonder Woman wife? Besides crying about the fact that she isn\u2019t doing the unreciprocated emotional labor you demand now that her body is growing another human that is\u2026", "He\u2019ll have a side piece by month 7"]}
