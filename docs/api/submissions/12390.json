Doesn't want to be touched at all, everything makes her uncomfortable, she feels like garbage all the time, etc etc. I'm not trying to dismiss any of these changes in her because obviously she has a legitimate reason and this is typically not her usual behavior. I can see past most of this because she truly isn't taking these things out on me. She just seems pissed off a good 60% of the day. The pregnancy hasn't been particularly hard (no morning sickness at all- her biggest issues are ankle pain) but her hormones are just completely off the charts. \n\nSo basically, my needs are being completely neglected. As selfish as that sounds given the situation, it still makes me incredibly angry. I try spending time with her often. Like, let's go to the store, let's go ride around in the car, let's watch a movie, let's play video games together, etc etc. She doesn't want to do shit. Walking around a store makes her ankles hurt, sitting in a car makes her legs swell, watching movies makes her tired, playing video games gives her a screaming headache. And the more I ask her to hang out with me, the more it pisses me off because I feel like chop liver. \n\nSo basically this all came to a head over the past week. I've been begging her to come hang out with me and do something. She says she wants to but her body is just \"done\". She doesn't even try though. So I brought it up last night and I will admit that I had a tone about my voice that was very accusing because of everything and she became immediately irate. She says that she cooks every single night, she cleans 24/7, I don't do anything but run to the store for her, I don't help her do anything, me constantly nagging her for attention after she's busted her ass all day is exhausting and making her resentful because why don't I offer something that she enjoys like showering together or rubbing her swollen feet and ankles. It was just completely switched in to a \"you don't do shit for me\" argument and I truly can't tell if I'm wrong here. I slept on the couch and I won't speak to her until she apologizes to me for lashing out after expressing my feelings to her. However, my mom says my wife has a valid point because the things I want to do are things my wife isn't interested in and pushing my hobbies off on an already hormonal woman would piss her off too.

I can see past most of this because she truly isn't taking these things out on me. She just seems pissed off a good 60% of the day. The pregnancy hasn't been particularly hard (no morning sickness at all- her biggest issues are ankle pain) but her hormones are just completely off the charts. \n\nSo basically, my needs are being completely neglected.
