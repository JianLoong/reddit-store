He is a bright boy but he is twelve and goofs off like most children his age.\n\nMy son's English teacher, Rachel, does not like him and picks on him. She is convinced Matt is a \"bully\" for behaving the way most boys his age do. Her main issue is that my son supposedly picks on another kid in his class, Bryson. He is not physically touching Bryson at all and only teasing him like pretending he farted in class to make his classmates laugh. She is taking away recess privilege from my son almost every week for minor incidents like this. We have met many times but it goes nowhere because she does not listen to me. She favors Bryson over my son to a concerning degree.\n\nPersonally I think she is failing as a teacher by sheltering Bryson to this degree. He is \"on the spectrum\" but he goes to school with average kids instead of a special school. If he is always given his way and treated this fragile then he will grow up to be an irresponsible adult who cannot handle life. But I am not his parent so my only real concern is that my son is in a toxic environment with an adult that has it out for him.\n\nI scheduled a meeting with the principal. It went well and the principal agreed that Rachel was unfairly punishing my son. I asked that R not be allowed to revoke recess privileges for Matt and that was agreed. But then out of nowhere, R says that she is quitting. I was completely stunned, I told her I never not wanted her to quit. She told me that she wasn't just leaving the school but quitting teaching entirely.\n\nWord somehow got out and now whenever I go on campus other teachers and parents are cold to me because R was a well liked teacher. I do not think I am to blame because I never wanted or asked for her to leave the school. I only wanted my son to stop being unfairly picked on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Alright I get it.

Parents like you, who expect that their kids can be assholes all of the time and the rest of the world has to adjust and make accommodations.

At least half of all teachers quit within five years. People like you, who make our jobs harder, are a huge part of why. Shame on you.

And whatever school she goes to next, she will be telling everyone in the teacher lounge about the a-hole mom who bullied her out of a job and let his son constantly badger another kid.  And I have to ask, are you one of those who give big donations to the school every year? Because if you are, the school TOTALLY harassed that teacher, let that other boy to continue to be picked on, because of your pocketbook. And again, I don't know that for sure, but I have heard of situations like that in private school. And now that the teacher quit, that boy has no one to protect him from your son. Shame on you, OP. Shame. on. YOU. P.S.

He is a bright boy but he is twelve and goofs off like most children his age.\n\nMy son's English teacher, R, does not like him and picks on him. She is convinced M is a \"bully\" for behaving the way most boys his age do. Her main issue is that my son supposedly picks on another kid in his class, B. He is not physically touching B at all and only teasing him like pretending he farted in class to make his classmates laugh. She is taking away recess privilege from my son almost every week for minor incidents like this. We have met many times but it goes nowhere because she does not listen to me. She favors B over my son to a concerning degree.\n\nPersonally I think she is failing as a teacher by sheltering B to this degree. He is \"on the spectrum\" but he goes to school with average kids instead of a special school. If he is always given his way and treated this fragile then he will grow up to be an irresponsible adult who cannot handle life. But I am not his parent so my only real concern is that my son is in a toxic environment with an adult that has it out for him.\n\nI scheduled a meeting with the principal. It went well and the principal agreed that R was unfairly punishing my son. I asked that R not be allowed to revoke recess privileges for M and that was agreed. But then out of nowhere, R says that she is quitting. I was completely stunned, I told her I never not wanted her to quit. She told me that she wasn't just leaving the school but quitting teaching entirely. \n\nWord somehow got out and now whenever I go on campus other teachers and parents are cold to me because R was a well liked teacher. I do not think I am to blame because I never wanted or asked for her to leave the school.

I wouldn't encourage my worst enemy to be a teacher.", "AH parents like OP see their kids as extensions of themselves, not autonomous human beings. If her precious baby boy is wrong that means, in her mind, that SHE'S wrong - and her ego won't allow that.", "OP made a fake account to say NTA lol \ud83d\ude02 never seen a profile deleted after comments", "A good parent should not be blind for the fact that their kid can do stuff that is not ok. I hate the 'my kid would never do that'-people when it's clear their kid in fact DID THAT.", "Protecting your kid from consequences is not being a good parent.", "So you are down with harassing a kid on the spectrum? Wow....  I don't know how you read any good parenting in there, unless today is Opposite Day and we are living in Upside-down land.", "Thank you.", "I would be asking my son what was fun about what was happening. And then I'd be telling them that if it happens again, they will be losing privileges at home as well. When my son was going to brick and mortar school, he knew that messing around and getting into trouble meant consequences at home as well. Teachers and the other students don't need that nonsense.", "All the bullies and jerks thinks \"it's fun\".", "Even with the son's side the OP is presenting, which is likely a very sanitized version... OP's son IS bullying the kid and for a horrific reason. I just... wow. I can see why the teacher would quit when admin is not only not backing them up but taking away the tools they have to deal with it.", "Yeah because tormenting their peers is something that bullies find fun", "This and we pay them almost nothing while micromanaging their classrooms.", "I think there is more to the story, people don't usually give up a career over one incident. I don't think this AH is the only AH at the school that this teacher was dealing with. \n\nI get these kids who go through school being special, and are protected from natural consequences; they get to the real world and it is a rude awakening for them.", "Plus bullying a child that\u2019s on the spectrum and she\u2019s okay with that? NEW LOW!!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "And then when the comment section does not go their way.... deletes the thread.  Just waiting on that part.", "That comment disgusted me so much. As the sister and wife of two autistic men, one of whom attended a mainstream school... the ableism is astounding here. I'm not going to say verbatim what I want to say because I value not being banned.", "This makes me furious. I\u2019m \u201chigh functioning\u201d autistic and did absolutely fine in school. Most people wouldn\u2019t even know unless I told them. In fact, I wasn\u2019t even diagnosed until my therapist suggested it last year at 22 years old. All autistic people do not need to be in a \u201cspecial\u201d school. Give me a break. You can be on the spectrum and fit in quite normally. I wish more people knew that.", "And points out that the kid does not need to be in a \"special school\" almost like how dare a neurodivergent person be at the same private school as Duddikens.  This is giving me strong Dursley (harry potter)  vibes here.", "Don't forget that Bryson will also become \"an irresponsible adult who can't handle life if he keeps getting treated as fragile and given his way\". \nYTA and the reason good teachers walk out. I'm sure she's not the only teacher who has been thankful they only have your son for several months while you'll be stuck with him for life.", "Same.", "I don't think it was meant to be hilarious. They indicted a school shooter who was probably bullied in school.  I hope you misunderstood and don't actually think it's hilarious that children have been murdered in their schools.", "It\u2019s a mother, the bully comes in all forms :(", "Yes. Absolutely", "Oh I think I glossed over that part. I was so pissed off by that point I could barely see straight.", "The principal agreeing was the convincing factor to me, I'm sure he has done stuff and I'm not saying it's right, just that she's nta for defending her son.", "Oh shut up! You found another asshole to agree with you. Read the other comments and take some advice or your son will grow up to be an immature bully who won\u2019t make it in the real world.", "Lmao pleasee. You are so pathetic. Only responding to the one comment that justifies your shitty behavior. I see where your son gets his bad behavior from. You are an embarrassment of a parent. Shame on you. \n\nMAJOR YTA", "Responding to the one N T A vote does nothing but show how much of an AH you are. YTA", "OP, boys being boys isn't a thing any more. What your son did? I went through as a kid. It is bullying and it's really scarring when you have a hard enough time fitting in. Don't encourage it.", "Don't fall into the trap of confirmation bias. You are failing your child by encouraging him to be cruel to people with disabilities. You are reinforcing that being a bully is OK. \n\nThe reason that teacher quit is because the spineless head teacher told her she's not allowed to protect a disabled child from your sons vicious bullying. \n\nKid kill themselves over this shit. Do you want that on your sons conscience?", "YTA and you\u2019re a terrible parent. Hopefully being ostracized by other parents and teachers gives you a sense of shame that you can develop into other useful emotions like humility and empathy.", "Lol you found the one person that agrees with you, congrats! No wonder your son is the way he is.", "lol of course this is the only comment you respond to. \n\nanother asshole raising assholes. give yourself a round of applause and then slap yourself across the face a few times for shits and giggles.", "Lol, was that your alt account, you are a terrible parent and person. I hope every teacher and parent shun your ahole of a son and you. Bet he's going to love changing schools at that age and being bullied in his new one for being the new kid", "This is the only judgement you\u2019re going to engage?", "This is the only comment you\u2019re going to reply to\u2026? YTA your kid is TA. The consequences of this sadly won\u2019t be seen for years to come but just know it\u2019s not too late to be a better parent/human being.", "M'am, you need the pile on here.  \n\n\nI know it is hopeless, you will go to bed thinking 99.8% of the respondents are trash and the single deleted comment that supported you (which probably came from you) was the only one that mattered.  \n\n\nUse this as a growth day. Think about it.  Try to see the world from the bullied student and the teacher you bullied ooints of view.  \n\n\nWe need good teachers, your selfushness has cost society.   \n\n\nAdministration took your side because they take your check, you are on a moral island all alone. Your son will become an awful person if both of you don't seek change, growth and counseling,  \n\n\nGood luck.", "Nice, your only comments is to the one AH that agrees with you. Don\u2019t be fooled. You aren\u2019t protecting your son. You\u2019re are enabling his bully behavior.", "It's funny that you only reply to the one person who said what you wanted to hear. Why did you even ask if you're not prepared to listen to people's opinions? Probably because you know you messed up and you tried to present your biased side of the story here to get validation and make yourself feel better. But even when you tell it from your perspective, people can see that you acted selfish and ignorant. Be careful, boys that are always being told that they can do no wrong often grow into men who do a lot of wrong.", "Awww You were the bully in your school, weren'tcha?", "What amazes me is that they\u2019ve put up with the pay for decades. It\u2019s the abuse and the system preventing them from doing their job that is the final straw.", "For real. That makes it worse!", "OP might want to familiarize herself with federal law. One of these days her brat is going to harass a kid whose parents know the law, and boy is she in for a surprise.", "Agreed. It was appalling.", "I'm on the spectrum *and* I'm a teacher. Imagine what I'm not saying.", "I\u2019m autistic and it got missed because I was in the highly capable broken. I would say 90% of the kids in my class either have ADHD or are autistic or both.", "Trump got indicted yesterday, which is funny to several people.", "OR maybe, and I realize I have not proof of this, maybe OP donated money to the private school every year and the school doesn\u2019t want to lose her money. That shit DOES happen in private schools where the kids whose parents have money get away with all kinds of shit at the detriment of other Kids. And so far, I haven\u2019t seen OP on here denying my accusations (I wrote in my comment), so I might not be off base here.", "It also happens many many times in schools when there is a horrible parent that is constantly complaining ALL. THE. TIME. That the principal took the cowards way out and gave her what she wanted to make her go away - I've seen it so many times as a teacher.", "You\u2019re an ah, and clearly the apple didn\u2019t fall too far! Yikes", "No she didn\u2019t, it\u2019s her \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "The person with the NtA comment deleted their profile\u2026 my guess is that it was OP who created the profile so she could agree with herself", "I\u2019m sayin! If there\u2019s any way to make bullying worse, nailed it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Even in public schools, admin are notorious for avoiding disciplining students to avoid conflict with parents. It\u2019s easier to just tell the teachers to suck it up.", "Interesting theory, I went to a public school so idk. The principal agreeing was just the deciding factor for me, but if that's how it is in private schools then I'm probably wrong", "I\u2019ve taught in public schools and I\u2019ve worked in churches. (And in the US, many private schools are church affiliated.) I can say through personal experience that many times, principals and boards will \u201cagree\u201d with someone simply to keep the peace, not necessarily bc they believe they speak the truth. And often they will side with the party that has power and/or influence in the community or congregation. And we really don\u2019t know the extent of the principal\u2019s agreement. Did he just agree that she would no longer restrict his recess or that she had been wrong? Stating that she had been wrong in front of the parent without investigating would have been inappropriate for an administrator.", "Now I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s like that in ALL private schools, I just can only go off of experiences that my friends had with their kids.", "Oh interesting, so some people you know had similar experiences, much more convincing than just randomly hearing a rumor, thanks for sharing", "I'll chime in to second their opinion with my own real world experience. Private schools are very aware of where the bread is buttered. The staff and faculty do tend to toe the line of money in the sandbox."]}
