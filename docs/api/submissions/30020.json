My sister has written 5 \u0410ITA p\u043ests with 2 \u0430ccounts as well as multiple \u0440osts on other subs with very great detail about serious family issues. She also adds fake details or greatly exaggerates issues to make me, my parents or her teachers seem far worse than they really were. One example is we got into a massive argument because she keeps wearing my clothes. She wrote the post as she borrowed a shirt and jacket a few times and left out the part where she also wore my underwear 3 times. She made it seem like she only occasionally wears my stuff but she takes stuff without even asking or letting me know. If she just asked I'd be fine (minus the underwear thats disgusting). Another instance is she wrote a post that made my parents seem like massive assholes because they wouldn't drive us to red lobster like they promised if she got a good grade on a test. She left out the fact that my parents did drive us to red lobster but unfortunately it was closed and the next closest one was 1.5 hours away and my sister threw a tantrum since nobody else wanted to drive that far. My parents even promised to take us to the one nearby once it reopened and asked her what restaurant she'd like to go to for that day.\r  \n\r  \nI found out about the posts because she wrote an issue she had with my boyfriend and wrote some nasty things like I'm jealous since \"she's the hotter sister\". She has been flirting with my boyfriend and my boyfriend has turned her down, it makes him so uncomfortable he doesn't even come to our house anymore and she wrote a nasty post but later deleted it which made it seem like I manipulated him into hating her. My boyfriend's friend saw the post shared it to him who shared it to me, the details were too similar and she used our real first names and mentioned the state we lived in the posts and the city in another post on a unrelated sub. Apparently other people at the school found it and are talking about it as some of the posts had a few thousand upvotes.\r  \n\r  \nI showed this to my parents and they were fucking furious. They made my sister deleted all the posts and her entire reddit account and took away her electronics. My sister called me a massive bitch and said I betrayed her and I am the worst sister ever and our family is abusive and she will go \"N\u0421\" (don't know what that means) when she is 18.

Using real names on the internet? And if a friend shared it with your bf who shared it with you, then you can be sure it was shared with so many others before finding its way to you.\n\nSecondly, people who knows you and your family already figured out that the posts are about you, this can impact your social life greatly, and so much more for your parents, even your bf didn't get out of this unharmed, this is no longer her own business, not when it causes others harm, what if at some point she lied about something even worst and your parents supervisors at work happened to see it and make the connection? Word goes fast in small communities, so what if this got to a point where it affects there jobs?\n\nThirdly, she's a minor, her parents need to be in the picture about this behavior so they can hopefully be able to fix it before she's legally an adult and out of there hands, making fake posts to gain sympathy can be addicting, and before she knows it she will be making more and more things up in her head, and the worst part? She will start to belive her own lies.\n\nI don't think most people realize just how dangerous this can be.", "NTA. Your parents deserve to know what\u2019s being circulating around your social circles and your school. It would be different if people didn\u2019t greatly suspect it was your family. It seems very  likely people knew because she told them. If she wanted anonymity she would have gone to greater lengths to hide identities. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Honestly, don\u2019t post on here either, it\u2019ll keep you away from more drama.", "This is kind of the flaw of AITA.  We rely on the narrator to give an accurate account of the conflict and include all pertinent details.  And the narrator here will almost always have a biased PoV.  There\u2019s a lot more AH out there than are judged to be so here.", "NTA.\n\nWore your underwear? Wtf?? Doesn't she have some of her own?  Your sister has serious issues and needs professional help.  Reddit isn't going to help her.  You did the right thing.", "NTA. She sounds unhinged. NC means no contact though. It basically means she will ghost you usually.", "NTA.

You\u2019re understandably angry, I would be too. Your sister is also acting like she is angry and wants people to know she\u2019s angry. She could just be a jealous little b but do you think maybe there\u2019s something going on socially or emotionally that\u2019s causing her to lash out in such a public way?", "NTA", "YTA But, not for the reason you think. I would have kept reading these exaggerated posts for ideas on how to gaslight her for petty revenge. \ud83d\ude1c Not really, but you had an opportunity to visit the inside of your sister\u2019s demented version of the truth. That information could have helped you combat some of the ridiculous behavior you encountered with her.\n\nSometimes, you need to think these things through before you act. \ud83e\udd14", "NTA. Your sister betrayed your family.", "NTA sister sounds unhinged. She sounds like she needs help", "YTA\n\nDo you know what the word 'hypocrisy' means?", "ESH. And here you are doing the exact same thing. You want us to take you at face value and deem your sister to be a selfish monster. When it\u2019s probably in the middle. And you probably suck just as much as your sister.", "Unless she named you what do you care who she lies to about what?  You can't stop her telling people how she feels, even if it's not accurate.  Better here than at school where people know you.  Most posts here are just rage bait tbh, nobody expects all of it to be accurate.   \n People do stuff, no need to jump in and add your own asshole behavior to it.\n\nYTA", "ESH. Your sister is an AH for doing that by lying. But: You're clearly an AH. All you want is payback, and that's why you showed your parents and now us. You also want to hear that you're right, but you are not\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f What kind of harm did she cause? These people here don't know you and for sure don't care much longer as the next judgeable issue is posted.  \n\nShe posted about you all to talk to someone and get validated. Lying is shit, but it tells me that she has no truly safe environment to talk about such things. And your and your parents' reactions are nice proof for that.", "You are both young, and overdramatic. I would say you both should stay off Reddit and try to talk to each other like the young adults you are. Good luck!", "If you'd tackled your sister instead of going straight to your parents I'd have said N T A. As it is, this is an ESH. Especially as you're now on reddit slagging off your sister.", "You left out how you found out about her posts.", "So your sister posted on Reddit, and your response was to post on Reddit to complain about her? I\u2019m wondering about how honest either of you are. Maybe she\u2019s the honest one and you\u2019re mad about being called out for your sht. Or maybe she\u2019s actually dishonest in her posts and trying to make everyone look bad. Who knows. Either way, you\u2019re doing the same thing she did (posting on Reddit to complain about her posting on Reddit to complain about you).

You whine and complain that someone made a reddit post about you, so you go and run off to make a reddit post about them? \n\nTwo.  You are sisters. You should have each other's backs.  You should talk to her before you rat her out to your parents. \n\nNC means no contract. Meaning that once she moves out. She will stop talking to you at all.
