But the not interested argument could cover it, since I didn't need the knowledge until now.", "So why does him not knowing make him suck?", "I get that. She said it's insulting in the sense that it's basic knowledge and I should know it, since she is studying it, which adds more to the reasoning.", "That sounds like something I'd propose. Thanks for the tip!", "Hah, just the way I like them.", "Thank you for the resource! I will give it a read.", "We spoke a couple of years ago, but only as friends, then we didn't talk for a while. Eventually we reconnected and something sparked. And I do get that it's ignorant. I will try to study a bit more about it.", "$ man biology > toread.txt", "Although, to be fair, your heart is actually in the center of your chest. It's just bigger on the left side because that's the half that has to pump blood around your body, whereas the right side just pumps it to your lungs.", "Sure.

Knowing a little about what is normal for your body really helps for that.", "NTA, but man... you ***gotta*** know these things. \n\nKnowing what treatments and chemical reactions cause various bodily conditions is typically specialist knowledge. Knowing where your heart is, or knowing when your lymph nodes are swelling and what that means, is basic shit you need to know to help survive. Its rather like understanding how MySQL is powering various databases behind your websites... not really important to most people. But knowing you don't throw your computer into the swimming pool, basic fucking knowledge.\n\nThis isn't a hill to die on for ignorance. You need to know how your body operates in the basic level to ensure you identify illnesses early on and seek treatment when needed. Or be able to perform basic first aid n the case of a emergency.", "Yeah, it'd be good to know. But being ignorant on a subject doesn't automatically make you an asshole in and of itself.\n\nIt'd be good for me to know how to do an oil change, but I don't. I'm not an asshole for that.", "I give her a mild AH because she has a point. But she could have offered to teach you rather than getting all indignant about it. I have found explaining what I have learned helps reinforce the information in my head.", "if she's going to be your girlfriend for any length of time, I suggest you learn basic reproductive anatomy STAT", "You don\u2019t need to \u201cstudy\u201d anything. Just learn the basics so you at least understand how both male and female bodies work. It\u2019s kind of essential knowledge if you intend to live a long life.", "I agree that we all need to know basic anatomy for our own health awareness. I admit I've been ignorant on my own anatomy over the years (of which has led to some awkward doctors appointments). But again, it isn't an AH situation. You're not doing it to be malicious or unkind. Your girlfriend needs to be a bit less judgmental if she's intending to have a career in healthcare because that attitude isn't good around patients, of whom also won't have anatomy expertise.", "This may not apply, and seem to come from left field, but if you live in the US, men not knowing basic anatomy has become a Very Scary Thing for a lot of women. I've gotten angry and friends and have seen others get in legit arguments over it, because right now there are laws being passed based on how people understand certain pieces of medicine/biology, and the people passing those laws insisting on Completely False Things because they don't know any better and writing laws based on that fiction, which can cause very real harm.\n\nA huge part of the problem is our educational system, which doesn't even cover the bare minimum, but the way it's affecting laws and people's health has turned it into a very touchy issue. I imagine that'd be even moreso for a woman studying medicine.", "It\u2019s your relationship, but I don\u2019t really get how it\u2019s an insult to her personally that you don\u2019t know what a lymph node does, or even where your heart is if you\u2019ve never needed to know. I could understand her laughing, poking a bit of fun, or sharing her knowledge with the expectation that you would listen\u2026 but taking personal offense is a really strange reaction. Like, just as an example, imagine if I was really into video games, and I was studying to be a game developer. Then I go and tell my friend that is an insult to my whole field of study and also me personally that they didn\u2019t know what Minecraft was, or had never played it.

Perhaps I read this without more contexts and tones (like she was calling you an asshole as a joke?), but even as jokes, I find that degrading and disrespectful. I'd have agree with her if she's concern that you don't even have the basic knowledge to take care of yourself or someone (first aid) and insists on you learning it, but not her calling you an asshole for that. And justifying that her knowledge is more important so she can call you an asshole was the cherry on top for me. Anyway, you did say you guys didn't argue and you're not harboring any resentment so I shouldn't be arguing/ be negative", "I don\u2019t think her niche is more useful than hers especially considering how big a role IT has in the field of medicine. Cybersecurity is really important, you wouldn\u2019t want someone accessing or altering your computerized health records.", "This is actually a really good idea. One of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to someone else. \nYou are not an asshole for not knowing something. Most people learn something new everyday.

You\u2019re not an AH at all lol", "You don't need to learn everything in the abstract. Learn what is relevant to how you feel physically and what makes sense to be healthier. For example, it doesn't really matter if you know what the names of bones are, but if you know how things are connected and why something might hurt when you overdo it that can help you.", "I relate to that a lot. I dated a nuclear physicist. Obviously, most of his studies were far beyond me. But it really hurt his feelings when I smiled and nodded while he was talking. He would WAY rather have me admit I didn't get it in the moment/ explain the concept to me 100 times and dumb it down than have me completely not understanding him. Without understanding, ya aren't really listening. \n\nC'mon, you're smart. You can do it. I suggest spending the next day that you have off studying basic anatomy. Like: \n- human hormones/ what over or under production causes\n- what the brain does/what it needs \n- the heart/what it does/what is a heart attack\n- lymph nodes/ where are they/ what do they do/what are some common conditions that cause them to swell \n- blood pressure - what affects it, why is it important \n- sexual health basics. \n\nEffort means a lot. Even if you can't understand everything, showing her that you're trying to understand what's important to her will mean a lot.", "He doesn't know ANY of it he said, and he admitted that she talks to him about it. It's important to support your partners passions, and I mainly think he's the a-hole in this case because he doesn't understand why she is upset. \n\nBut OP, don't be hurt. I don't think you're an a-hole overall. We all make mistakes and fall short on things sometimes. Interest in changing that is a big deal. <3", "At 23 he should be able to participate in his own healthcare decisions, how is he doing that when he doesn\u2019t know his own basics?", "You being ignorant isn\u2019t an insult to anyone but yourself. Maybe she\u2019s embarassed by it? But again, why. This is a great opportunity for her to reinforce her knowledge by explaining things to you. \n\nLol why would you know what SHEs studying?", "As someone who looks at hearts for a living, I'll have to correct you a bit here. Normal heart position is leftward, with the apex pointing to the left. The left lung is slightly smaller to accommodate (2 lobes, right has 3 lobes). \n\nThe second point is kinda right. The left side is generally larger in diameter, but it's difficult to determine volumetrically because the LV and RV are very differently shaped.", "I don't know what MySQL is but this sounds like a really great analogy and I like the part about not throwing the computer in the pool!", "And not getting vaccinated or vaccinating their kids, which helps stop the spread of diseases. I mean polio is back, WTF?!", "It is ridiculous in the sense that it's a double edged sword most of the time, I agree.", "It is a bit harder to be honest. It's very situational at best. She also seems to not really trust most health related websites, unless they are certified or governmental.", "I think that's the thing with my relationship. The way I see it, we complete eachother in the sense that she can help me with my migraines, and I can help her with her computer lol.", "It was more of a \"I know we were joking, but this is serious\" kind of turn. I don't know first aid because I never got the chance to learn about it. When I was in school, the one time the Red Cross guys came to our school to teach us first aid was the time I was home, due to migraines.\nAnd no, no resentment, we rarely get upset about one another because we are very candid about things.", "Glad to hear that it's better. Hopefully it'll stay that way. \nAnd I guess that tastes really do differ lol.", "I didn't rly get the sense that he was \"revelling\" in it tho, more that it was just one of those things that doesn't stick in ur head. I have plenty of things like that, and he seems to have found a workaround by just checking both sides.", "I will. Thanks a lot for this list! And I get what you mean with your previous experience. Obviously I do not see programming as being more complicated than nuclear physics, but in the end, it's a niche in and of itself that requires some baseline from where you ought to start. I'd rather re-explain something over and over in more familiar terms rather than knowing that the one I'm talking to didn't get it.", "I barely know the name of bones.\nI will try to research it, for her sake.", "This might not be a popular opinion, but I think that this is why we have doctors, medics, nurses, pharmacists, and so on. They know what's better, and my knowledge about their field won't change much.", "Well, for one there's loads of information readily available on the internet so if something were to come up it's pretty easy to just do that. But even then, it doesn't make him an asshole to not know. I have plenty of things that no matter how many times I look something up I always manage to forget again. Just how some brains are wired, especially when there's not much opportunity for that information to be reinforced regularly to retain it", "Because it's a rather important part of her life, and I do see the glitter in her eyes when she talks about it.", "In vet med, we listen to the heart on both sides of the chest. Interesting.", "In that she is right. Dr. Google is an incompetent charlatan.", "Yeah it's cool when you & your SO, when together, have this huge spectrum of knowledge. Def contenders in trivia games! \n\nOther than this instance, how do you feel about yourself when you're around her?", "Then that's all that matters. Welp, she's studying that at one point and can teach you. win-win", "That's awesome, OP. Good luck! You got this!", "We can\u2019t make decisions for you though and you can\u2019t make a proper decision without basic knowledge.", "Mhm but you don\u2019t care for biology, is she going to learn to programming languages for you?", "We do that because animal chests are a different shape than humans though. The heart is still closer to the left body wall than the right and depending on where you are auscultating will determine which valves you are listening to.", "Pretty good to be honest. We've been together for 5 months now, and we both got out of toxic relationships in the past, so we set some ground rules when we started dating.\nI do feel a bit overwhelmed with her around, because I am more of a simple person, both when it comes to style, clothing and general demeanour. She is more of a high fashion person, and I am more of a t-shirt and jeans kind of guy.\nHer knowledge also makes me feel a bit inferior at times. She dropped out of her first college degree, which was pedagogy. And now she is taking a 3 years program to become a registered nurse.\nI, myself, finished a CompSci 4 years college and I am currently enrolled in a master's program for Cybersecurity. But I still feel like she studied more than I did, mainly because my field is more of a practical one, rather than purely based on theory.\nBut I still care for her and really like her, I could even say love, but it's a bit early for that. I feel like she is trying to bring the best in me, by helping me dress up more... Stylish? And she is helping me a lot with my migraines and depression. And I am very grateful for that. She understands me and I understand her, but sometimes we have moments like these. I don't know if that makes sense.", "Hah, true that. Thanks for the reply and the help!", "I agree, but if a medic tells me in a hospital that I suffer from Y and I should do X, I won't question what they told me. Worst case, I'd read about it myself for a bit.", "No, she absolutely abhors the idea of programming or maths.", "I identify a but with your current relationship. \n\nCondensing things here: I hate cooking. I even consider eating to be a PITA. It doesn't relax me, its just a chore. My mom was a lunch lady and my dad had simple tastes, so we were a meat and potatoes kind of family. Married in my 20's, got by with simple meals, 2 kids later my husband discovers he likes to cook. Fantastic!! You cook I clean. Divorced,  then got with a chef. I was consistently embarrassed by my seemingly complete lack of kitchen knowledge. But he was amazing! Always being kind, even when he had to be rolling his eyes in the inside. I ended up being his little helper in the kitchen, chopping things and cleaning up. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that he treated me with love and compassion. He didn't make me feel bad for something I didn't learn because I had no interest in it. He just kissed me and thanked me for helping. \n\nSo does she think YTA?", "NTA, but... \n\nDo you even lymph, bro?", "NTA. A lot of us know anatomy from very sneaky but purposeful customs. Like in the US, we put our hand over our heart to pledge allegiance. When you do that for so long, you will never forget where your heart is. But ironically, it is a misnomer, because the heart is a lot closer to the center of the chest than most people realize.", "NTA\nShe thinks you're an asshole because you don't know about her field of study? Yikes. She sounds extremely wrapped up in herself. Pay attention to that red flag.", "NAH\n\nHowever I\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t know? As a medical student my then partner knew all this kind of thing, because he helped me revise for exams and practice practical skills. As a healthcare student 95% of your waking hours is either placement or studying, it\u2019s kinda impressive you have managed to avoid it. Maybe you don\u2019t get to spend a lot of time together?", "NTA her logic here sounds unreasonable. I wouldn\u2019t have a clue what lymph nodes do, but knowing where your heart is would probably be a good thing to learn. Regardless, it\u2019s irrational for her to expect you to magically know stuff just because she has studied it, especially if she has no intention of understanding what you study.", "NTA. Start grilling her for not knowing stuff about IT", "NAH - Honestly, I don't think you've been an AH based on your description here, but I also don't blame your GF for getting annoyed, I would be annoyed if my other half did this, as I would suspect that she's either a moron, or deliberately acting as though she were a moron, both of which I would find annoying.\n\nKnowing where your heart is is nothing to do with having paid attention in school, you can literally feel it beating away in your chest!", "Nta. Based on what you told us your girlfriend was practically judging you rather than advising you out of concern. And excuse me, but how the hell is IT not used? Did a medicine student just tell you that computer skills are not necessary in this day and age?", "NTA: im 35 an a industrial engineer. Idk much about my body at all and sure as hell dont know what a lymph nodes is or what it does.", "Lol at her thinking that IT skills are not widely used. As we sit here debating on a media platform operated entirely via a worldwide computer network. \n\nNTA", "You should have just told her you were a timelord", "I don't really want to leave the relationship. It wasn't really serious, but I just needed some opinions to form my own.", "She is completely alien to anything IT related.", "It's just that she found it insulting based on the fact that it's like me growing up on a farm and not being able to tell different animals.", "Hah. Noted this one down.", "We go out/at eachother's maybe once or twice a week, and get some weekends together once or twice a month.", "Oh my God. Stop calling IT niche.\n\nYes everyone is here thanks to modern medicine and we will all need a doctor someday, but we all also use IT everyday.\n\nHer eftpos and credit cards run thanks to some tricky software.\n\nHer textbooks are almost certainly digitised on a computer.\n\nTrains run on time, TV shows are made, information is disseminated, medical imaging is made possible, companies run, profits are made, Reddit is here, by.... yes... you guessed it! Computers, software and the IT professionals that build and run them.", "Hate to  break it to you but you shouldn't need to study to know where your heart is. Also should probably know what lymph nodes are for because if they are swollen you often need to go to the doctor (for a range of reasons, mild to severe, especially depending on where they are in your body)", "You really don't. You need to know what **your body** is like in a healthy state, and if that changes, see a health care professional.\n\nWould it hurt to know? of course not. More knowledge is a good thing. But you can always google \"swollen lump in armpit\" and you can find the info that way. Then see a doctor.\n\nAn interesting fact to know is that most medical knowledge is based on average height and weight white men. That 'left arm pain means a heart attack' that everybody knows about, is false if you are a woman. The 'recovery position' that you put unconscious people in, doesn't work with overweight people. The weight of their own arm can actually stop them breathing again and you need to pull the arm back.\n\nI got sidetracked.... my point is, know your own body, and notice any changes.", "Might be the plague, though.", "That makes sense, you don\u2019t get to spend loads of time together, I was thinking how on earth did you manage to avoid learning all this. I\u2019m sure my ex even now could do a full top to toe examination because of how many times he was used as a patient \ud83d\ude02"]}
