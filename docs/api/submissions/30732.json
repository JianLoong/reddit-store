To be completely up front, my wife has never been kind to her, but she has her share of problems as well and I really do wish my daughter, Faye, would be more sympathetic to them. I married her 15 years ago and she is 57. Also to be upfront, I am a bit \"online\" myself and my wife and son (15M) do frequently have to tell me to leave Twitter arguments alone. Faye was raised online, so this is likely partially my fault.\n\nTo make a long story short, Faye left us at 19 and did not get back into contact until she was 27. I was very happy to hear from her and I thought things were going well.\n\nA few months ago, I came to find out that Faye is a writer in the online sphere that focuses on trauma recovery. She writes about other things as well, but most of the personal things she writes involves trauma. I'm trying to present both sides here, so I will say that Faye has never used names, ages, locations, professions, or other identifying information- but anyone close to us would be able to identify us due to the specific circumstances she writes about.\n\nThis upset both my wife and I greatly. I read through it all. It's good writing, but she's spewing our personal history all over the internet with no regard to who can see it. My wife and I have also found that she's changed some details and somewhat exaggerated others. It's very, very upsetting and I don't think it's healthy to deal with this.\n\nI confronted her about it and she did not react well. She told me loudly that she did not want to talk about it, questioned how I found it, and completely refused to even acknowledge that I wanted to talk about it. I understand boundaries, but I don't think it's appropriate to shut someone down like that when they're trying to talk to you about their behavior.\n\nI told her that she needs to deal with this in therapy. She coldly told me that she has been in intense therapy \"because of us\" for 10 years and has dealt with it in therapy.\n\nThe next day, everything was wiped. She left up a post demonizing us and calling us stalkers. That was it. I'm heartbroken, but at the same time, she was talking about me and my wife on the internet in public and I believe I had a right to confront her about it. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: My wife and son are telling me to stop replying now and I'm trying to be less \"online\" and know when to stop replying to people, so I'm going to let this stew for a bit.", "created_utc": 1699653735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17sf2uw/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_to_stop_talking/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To be completely up front, my wife has never been kind to her, but she has her share of problems as well and I really do wish my daughter, Faye, would be more sympathetic to them. I married her 15 years ago and she is 57. Also to be upfront, I am a bit \"online\" myself and my wife and son (15M) do frequently have to tell me to leave Twitter arguments alone. Faye was raised online, so this is likely partially my fault. \r  \n\r  \nTo make a long story short, Faye left us at 19 and did not get back into contact until she was 27. I was very happy to hear from her and I thought things were going well.\r  \n\r  \nA few months ago, I came to find out that Faye is a writer in the online sphere that focuses on trauma recovery. She writes about other things as well, but most of the personal things she writes involves trauma. I'm trying to present both sides here, so I will say that Faye has never used names, ages, locations, professions, or other identifying information- but anyone close to us would be able to identify us due to the specific circumstances she writes about.\r  \n\r  \nThis upset both my wife and I greatly. I read through it all. It's good writing, but she's spewing our personal history all over the internet with no regard to who can see it. My wife and I have also found that she's changed some details and somewhat exaggerated others. It's very, very upsetting and I don't think it's healthy to deal with this.\r  \n\r  \nI confronted her about it and she did not react well. She told me loudly that she did not want to talk about it, questioned how I found it, and completely refused to even acknowledge that I wanted to talk about it. I understand boundaries, but I don't think it's appropriate to shut someone down like that when they're trying to talk to you about their behavior. \r  \n\r  \nI told her that she needs to deal with this in therapy. She coldly told me that she has been in intense therapy \"because of us\" for 10 years and has dealt with it in therapy.\r  \n\r  \nThe next day, everything was wiped. She left up a post demonizing us and calling us stalkers. That was it. I'm heartbroken, but at the same time, she was talking about me and my wife on the internet in public and I believe I had a right to confront her about it.

Abusers purposely pick out cowards like you because they know you'll look the other way and protect their image.", "I think you have established that you cannot be trusted to protect your children, so not shocked that you don\u2019t realize that your son is being abused.", "As someone with c-PTSD, i hope someone intervenes and saves your son too because your wife is an abuser and you are an enabler", "Screaming at someone is verbal and emotional abuse. You are a terrible excuse for a father and I hope you have a horrible rest of your life.", "Bravo, just let the ABUSE continue for from first kid to second kid, do not have a third. Have you check your back for your wife's shoes marks yet? Because you're her doormat to step on.", "It\u2019s highly likely your son is abused.\nIf he\u2019s got anxiety issues and in therapy, is near an abusive person you recognize is still abusive, and the other victim is unhappy about it (likely recognizing the same experience she went through), then he\u2019s been abused.\nHe also likes your daughter probably cuz victim solidarity. \n\nAnyway, your daughter is likely using the internet as a way of alleviating stress from her abusive upbringing, and you\u2019ve taken that away from her. Just like you and your wife have taken away a happy childhood from your children.", "If you care about your son, even a little bit - if you *actually* love him, if you can put aside your selfishness to consider that maybe, maybe his happiness is more important than yours. If you actually love him. Prove it. Leave your wife, take your son, get him away from her. Because what you are describing IS abuse, whether you want to admit it or not, whether you like that word or not.\n\nYou don't need to keep being a coward.\n\nBecause let me tell you, once that son is grown up? The one you're letting you wife scream at and treat like crap? He's probably gonna be gone.\n\nLook, my parent did *exactly* what you've done.  They stood by and let me be abused, they let the abuser stay, they made excuses, they insisted it wasn't actually abuse, and they got really upset if I ever told anyone anything about what my life was like.  They also insisted it was about \"privacy\". But it wasn't. It was that they knew everyone would be disgusted by what they let happen to me.  And I will never, ever, ever forgive them.\n\nYour kids aren't gonna forgive you.\n\nGet a backbone, get actual love and sacrifice, stop making your own anxiety and discomfort and selfishness so much more important than your *responsibility* to love and protect your children.\n\nThey trusted you, once. To take care of them. To keep them safe. And you've betrayed them over and over and over and over again.", "I hope your son can stay with his sister and leave the abusive home you think is fine.", "This dude really sucks ass.", "like I cannot, for the life of me, understand what the logic was", "This is why I said I know it's wrong, because I know it's not right to expect a college student to bleed all over herself just to sock away a few extra dollars. My wife had control over her finances at the time and was notified every time my daughter spent money out of her account (we did not give her money, she worked) and while I know that was wrong, I see where my wife was coming from. Kids are irresponsible with money and most of Faye's maternal side is destitute and we'd seen very irresponsible money behaviors. My wife was just trying to look out for her, but got too blinded by saving for college.", "I think she's choosing to deal with these two so she can stay in contact and be a support system for her brother. I mean, it's obvious by OP's other comments that he's being abused as well and I am supremely confident in my assessment that that toad of a wife is the type of person to bar access to the brother just to hurt Faye if she's not getting her way. \n\nIn fact, makes you wonder what all was said when they confronted her for daring to talk about the abuse she endured. Why'd she cave and take it down instead of telling them both to eat dicks? She cut off contact before, why not do it again now and keep the blog up? I think threats were made.", "With his \n\n\u201cTo be completely up front, my wife has never been kind to her\u201d\n\nI think he knows how bad it was and is attempting to downplay it.", "My mom was queen of saving her verbal and physical abuse for when my dad was not home.", "I hope this goes all over tiktok and fb *and* YouTube tbh", "YES!", "Unfortunately, you sound exactly like her. She seems to enjoy calling me a doormat.", "He is not treated the same as her. I will admit that my wife has her biases and has definitely treated our bio child better than Faye.", "Control is the only thing I can think of. Which is financial abuse.", "Your wife was not looking out for her. She was financially abusing her. She worked, and her own money but her stepmom was in control of her money. That was a control issue and financial abuse.", "If you KNOW it's wrong, what tf did you do to help? Stop it? Intervene? Protect your daughter? You were working from the basement, right? Did you tell your wife to apologise to Faye? Did you do anything except shrug your shoulders and move on with your life???\n\nEven here you act like you know it was wrong, but then you double down with excuses - kids are irresponsible with money, you've had experiences with poverty and irresponsible spending, your wife was just looking out for her, etc etc. \n\nThese contradict each other. Either it was justified, or it was wrong. It's not both. \n\nTake a damn stand for once in your life, you coward.\n\nEta: lmao you're still a damn coward, can't even tell your wife to mind her own business on a post YOU made looking for, as you called it, outside perspectives. Seriously, I hope you use all the money at your disposal to buy yourself a backbone. You are in severe need of one. I'm sure jellyfish have more rigidity in their spines than you ever could dream.", "Lmao your wife was NOT looking out for her. Financial abuse is a thing.", "She was in college, so likely an adult.  It was her money.  Your wife was controlling the money to the point that she was preventing her from purchasing necessities.  That wasn\u2019t looking out for her, that was financially abusing her.  YTA, and your wife is too.  I am glad Faye escaped from you both.", "You're making excuses for abusing your adult daughter. Disgusting.", "How is buying hygiene products irresponsible spending", ">My wife had control over her finances at the time and was notified every time my daughter spent money out of her account (we did not give her money, she worked) and while I know that was wrong, I see where my wife was coming from.\n\n\nWhy was your wife even given access to your adult daughter\u2019s finances, let alone given control over them? Your daughter made the only contributions to an account from working, and your wife monitored and controlled every purchase in the account? That is truly bizarre.", "Dude what the fuck. You\u2019ve admitted to basically allowing your wife to abuse your daughter. To the point that she\u2019s been in therapy for a DECADE. You don\u2019t even deserve the title \u201cfather\u201d. Jesus christ. Evaluate your fuckin priorities. I feel sorry for your children.", "And you are being blinded by the fact that the waste of space rotten sack of meat that is your sorry excuse for a wife continues to let you get your dick wet. Coward", "you are so fucking spineless. \n\nwhen your wife dies and you can\u2019t even wipe your own ass, and you\u2019re withering away in a nursing home where no one visits you, i hope you finally realize why.", "He says far more physical than she was so he knows the wife was physical with his child", "My stepmom too", "And I hope his daughter sees it & links us to her writing so we can know EXACTLY what went on", "Because you are one lol everyone can see it but you, just as everyone can see your wife for who she is except you. \n\nNot the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?", "Exactly like who? Faye? If so I\u2019ll take that as a compliment. Considering the abuse she\u2019s suffered and the trauma she\u2019s overcome she sounds like one hell of a woman DESPITE you. \n\nDoormat is a far kinder word than I would have used", "That's exactly how you've described yourself. Letting your kids be abused.", "That's because you are one. If you don't like what people are saying about you, change yourself instead of trying to silence them.", "You are a doormat. You're a bad father and a bad person.  YOU'RE AN ABUSER. Your nasty wife physically and emotionally abused your daughter; she traumatized her. But you don't care; you were happy to stand back and refuse to protect her like the selfish coward that you are. I'm glad your daughter exposed both of you for abusing her. And you did abuse her. You refused to protect her and so you enabled your monstrous wife's abuse.", "I mean, she ain't lyin', but what she's not saying is that's exactly why she's with you. Cause she can say and do whatever she wants to whomever she wants and you won't do shit about it except throw your children under the bus, make excuses, and look the other way.\n\nEdit: Unless you mean your daughter is the one calling you that, in which case she's not lying, either. \n\n\"Unfortunately, you sound exactly like her. She seems to enjoy calling me a doormat.\" Boohoo. Boy, you are not the victim here.", "YOU ARE ONE! Dang I feel sorry for you son. Letting him be abused like his sister. YTA", "Doormat: a submissive person who allows others to dominate them.\n\nWhy you're being called a doormat, your wife gets to abuse your kids. you let it happen.", "You're a failure of a father, simple as that.", "So what??? He's still being abused, just because it's not at the level that his sister was doesn't make it even remotely better. \n\nYou have willingly participated and enabled the abuse of two children. I hope that you understand that in your soul. \n\nTWO. CHILDREN. WERE. ABUSED. BECAUSE. OF. YOU. I hope your wife was worth it though.", "that and maybe it was some sort of weird humiliation thing", "He\u2019s such a weak, sorry ass excuse for a man and a father. Poor Faye.", "OP made it public. Might as well make it public-er! \n\nlol get your tea ready.", "Yes, those were words Faye used when chewing me out about the disagreement between my son and wife, which I didn't have anything to do with. I wasn't even in the house.", "He isn't being abused. My wife doesn't handle things well verbally all the time, but he's not being abused."]}
