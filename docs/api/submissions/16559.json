You've made it clear that you don't want children, but your parents continue to make comments about it. Their behavior is disrespectful and hurtful, and it's understandable that you're frustrated. You should have a serious conversation with your parents to explain your feelings and why their comments are not okay.", "My MIL just told my kids this week that she wants more great grand children.  So she decided to say \"Melvin*, you should go out and be promiscuous so I can have another great grand child\".\n\nSon is 16.

Also, please no r/justnomil responses.  She's closing in on 85 and we know she's just a little bit on the downslide.  The kids know better than to listen to the things that their grandparents say (racist, sexist, xenophobic, etc).  As my daughter mentioned....one day soon those views will die with them.", "NTA, they need to respect the boundaries you're setting.

Your parents have heard you respond the same every time, they know it's not a joke. They are now forcing their wishes on you.\n\nPlease have a serious conversation with them and if they continue to be dismissive of your feelings, maybe think about how you might limit your exposure to that dismissiveness. \n\nI sadly had to do this with my own mother when I told her I had to have a hysterectomy last year (also never wanted children) for the same reason she had one at the same age she had the surgery. But all she could think about was how she wouldn't be a grandmother.", "NTA, and ask them to explain why it is so funny, if after 9 months you still don't get the humor in it? jokes are only funny if both parties think it is, otherwise it is either bullying, or a child was telling it (more my 2 year old cousin is still grasping what a joke is and thinks that it is just knock knock, who's there, \\*insert random words here\\* \\*same random words here\\* who? \\*insert something totally unrelated\\*! she is trying, and it is cute, but definitely not funny XD)", "NTA.
