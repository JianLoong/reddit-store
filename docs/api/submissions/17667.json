It\u2019s a pretty big deal in our country and I\u2019ve been practicing for a long time. \n\nWhen I was 3, my parents got a divorce. They both later remarried and I lived primarily with my mum. I would go to my dads place one weekend a month. I really hated it there though. I love my dad but my step mum was not a welcoming person. She would treat me like a burden and say some rude things to her kids about me and my dad wouldn\u2019t defend me because he said my step mum would escalate it and cause a big fight if he did. In his effort to keep the peace with her, I felt like such an outcast whenever I was with them. When I was 14 I told my dad I don\u2019t want to come over on weekends anymore. He asked what he can do to make me more comfortable but my step mum said they should just do what I\u2019m comfortable with and let me stay with my mum full time for my sake. Dad didn\u2019t argue but he was very sad. I know he really wanted me there but I didn\u2019t feel like I was their family at all and I just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. \n\nSince then, he\u2019d offer to take me places and buy me stuff but most times I really didn\u2019t have time. I\u2019d spend most of my time at the rink practicing or studying but my dad thought I was blowing him off on purpose and would get sad about it.\n\nThe competition is in 2 weeks and my dad called to ask for a ticket so he can come. I felt really bad but told him I didn\u2019t have extra tickets. I told him he could still buy some on the website but I\u2019m out of the ones I got for free. There were 4 tickets and I gave 2 to my grandparents, 1 to mum and 1 to my stepdad. He said he understands giving them to my grandparents and mum, but why does step dad come before him? I said my step dad is the one that paid for all my skating classes and hired my coach. He would comfort me every time I cried because it was hard and he would do anything to make me feel better. He would pack meals for me and drive me to school and to practice on most days. He was a bigger rock to me than even my mum was and there\u2019s no one I want there more than him. He again thought I was doing this to spite him and got sad again. I told him I\u2019m not doing it to hurt him, but he can just buy a ticket from the website because I\u2019m not making my step dad pay for a ticket when he\u2019s spent so much money on me already.
