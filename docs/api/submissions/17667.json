I would go to my dads place one weekend a month. I really hated it there though. I love my dad but my step mum was not a welcoming person.

In his effort to keep the peace with her, I felt like such an outcast whenever I was with them. When I was 14 I told my dad I don\u2019t want to come over on weekends anymore. He asked what he can do to make me more comfortable but my step mum said they should just do what I\u2019m comfortable with and let me stay with my mum full time for my sake. Dad didn\u2019t argue but he was very sad. I know he really wanted me there but I didn\u2019t feel like I was their family at all and I just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. \n\nSince then, he\u2019d offer to take me places and buy me stuff but most times I really didn\u2019t have time.

There were 4 tickets and I gave 2 to my grandparents, 1 to mum and 1 to my stepdad. He said he understands giving them to my grandparents and mum, but why does step dad come before him? I said my step dad is the one that paid for all my skating classes and hired my coach. He would comfort me every time I cried because it was hard and he would do anything to make me feel better. He would pack meals for me and drive me to school and to practice on most days. He was a bigger rock to me than even my mum was and there\u2019s no one I want there more than him. He again thought I was doing this to spite him and got sad again. I told him I\u2019m not doing it to hurt him, but he can just buy a ticket from the website because I\u2019m not making my step dad pay for a ticket when he\u2019s spent so much money on me already.

He\u2019s trying to manipulate you now by saying he\u2019s sad that he has to pay for a ticket to your competition. Your stepdad more than deserves this honor. He is treating you the way your bio father should be treating you. Your mom hit gold when she met your stepdad and he has proven his worth by showing you exactly what you mean to *him*. I am also guessing your stepdad didn\u2019t ask for one of the free ones either. You picked the man who has been a true dad to you. My mom had a saying for years: Anyone can be a father but it takes a real man to be a dad! My stepdad is exactly like yours. The only difference in my life and yours, is my separation from my father was due to being too far away to see him. And my stepmom is awesome. She taught me as much as my own mother. Keep the people who love and support you the priority because your father doesn\u2019t prioritize you.

I would have ended that relationship really quick!", "NTA small change to your verbiage. drop the term 'step' your 'dad' got the free ticket. My parents also divorced when I was 3 and while they got on well they both remarried. My 'step' dad was amazing an never treated me as anything but his own, even though i wouldn't let him adopt me.  He died a few years back. but my wife knows i still am in contact with my 'father' but when zi talk about my dad, she knows i mean the guiy she met at our wedding, the one who raised me and the one I would have given that ticket to too.", "Nta,  It sounds like your stepdad stepped up into the job that even your dad wasn't willing to do.
