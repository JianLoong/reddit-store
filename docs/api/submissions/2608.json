During the course of living with him for two years, we understandably accumulated many shared items, much of which was for our apartment which he didn't take with him (i.e. a toaster, TV, throw blankets, etc.).\n\nI'm currently dating someone new (let's call him Adam), and everything was fine until one night when he was over at my place. Somehow the conversation got to a point where he found out that I had purchased the dinner set we were eating from with Oscar. \n\nAdam got a weird look on his face, and after some prying, he admitted that it made him feel uncomfortable knowing that I was still living in the same apartment I shared with Oscar and using items I had purchased with my ex. \n\nI told him that I had no sentimental feelings about the items (I mean, come on, it's literally a ceramic plate we bought at Ikea. It's not like we were talking about a build-a-bear Oscar made me with a voice memo). \n\nI sarcastically asked, \"What, do you expect me to throw everything away and buy new things?\" \n\nAND HE SAID YES. \n\nI told him there was no way I was going to do that, and we started arguing. I said if it bothered him so much he could pay for all new stuff, but then he called me a gold digger?! We ended the night with Adam leaving in a huff. He texted me saying that I disrespected his feelings and that he was really hurt that I would put things I bought with Oscar above his own feelings. I guess I could understand why it would make him feel icky, but I also feel like he's being unreasonable. \n\nMy friends are split between thinking Adam's acting out of line and thinking that I could be a little more understanding and try to compromise by getting *some* new things with Adam.
