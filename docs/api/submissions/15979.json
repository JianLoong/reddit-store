Seems odd to me but maybe I'm behind the times.", "Thank you for that! So sharing wedding photos with family is not a thing any more for some brides? I'm old school and trying to learn etiquette. I would have never guessed that I couldn't have pictures. Very interesting and good to know. \n\nSo when family and friends ask to see photos, what would be a good response?", "I did put in a nice amount for this wedding but not the point. I want photos of all but if she is going to refuse, then give me access to photos of myself, husband and son. I have shared photos of them as a couple and gushed about how beautiful she is.

I\u2019m also going to assume the pictures the bride posted contained many pictures that included her, the bride so MIL already has pictures of the bride/bride and groom. And since MIL was still asking for pictures of HER ONLY SON ON HIS WEDDING DAY it\u2019s safe to say DIL posted no pictures of just the husband/husband and son/son and mother. Which is fucking weird.", "We definitely helped pay for the wedding. \n\nDid she feel upstaged? I sure hope not! She is beautiful! Beautiful is never a word anyone would use to describe me. I'm a 60 year old woman who never took photos. It was lightly suggested I lose weight and I took it to heart. For them, myself and for future grand kids. And let's just say I knew she wanted perfection for this wedding. This was a no kids allowed, bridal party not allowed to stand in the ceremony because it could ruin pictures. I'm not saying she was a bridezilla but definitely wanted perfection. \n\nNo, I definitely let my son be his own person. I hope and pray that I did nothing to offend her before the wedding.

You order prints from the photographer, that's the only way you're allowed to print them in many contracts.\n\nMy new in-laws also wanted access to all our photos, but thankfully stopped pushing when I explained the above. And I'm sorry, you're asking for a photo \"dump\", not just a nice photo of you to put on fb or whatever.

If we\u2019re being honest, I understand her to a point.

Fair use is a valid defense, and if she's making a copy for display at her home, I think the copyright issue is a lot less severe and not asshole worthy.", "Exactly what I was trying to do. I would love photos with her as well! But I'll take anything I can get.", "Wait. What? Lightly suggested to lose weight?? Nope sorry. That is not okay.  You sound very lovely and trying extra hard at this relationship but that confirms for me that you are NTA here and we are missing something in this story from her end.", "First of all, congratulations on the weight loss. That is tremendous and takes a lot of dedication and discipline. 75lbs is amazing! That being said, I\u2019d be willing to bet she\u2019s probably peeved about that. \n\nInfo: Did you get a lot of compliments on your weight loss while at the wedding? If so I\u2019d almost guarantee that\u2019s the issue.\n\nMore info: The pictures she shared on social media, how many of them were you in? Were any of just you and your son?", "That\u2019s waaaaay too intimate to be memorialised on your inlaws wall forever. I\u2019d be embarrassed if I had to see that in print every time I visited my inlaws. Not sure why she put it on Fb.", "Yes, professional photos cannot be shared and used without consent. This is standard digital copyright stuff. She is locking you out because you overstepped. I have to do it to my MiL all the time. I put her in timeout until she behaves and then she gets access to grandkids again.", "It may be she doesn\u2019t want them shared, it may also be that she has agreed with the professional photographer not to share. I would tell people that she had a professional photographer so there are no photos of the wedding you\u2019re able to share until she\u2019s finished printing and distributing and encourage them to reach out to her or your son directly if they want to see.", "It sounds like OP doesn\u2019t care that it was a wedding.  Just that it was pics with her son, and she looked good in them.", "Why would anyone give people access to their private wedding photos that they paid for? It\u2019s a crazy overreaching request.  There are tons of photos in there that might be private to the couple, not flattering for certain people, etc. There is literally no reason the mother should have access to them.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA simply because she posted them on Facebook, bur find it curious you didn\u2019t answer my question.", "OP should just ask the wedding photographer if she can buy prints off her.", "Nope, leaving them be. We occasionally have dinner together, etc. They have always included us and we love them for that. \n\nI truly am clueless.  This hit out of left field. I thought it was odd that she posted pics but they weren't shareable. I did copy and share photos of the wedding knowing that it was probably going to make her angry. So I do have some ownership in this. I just need to know if it's natural for the bride to not want anyone else to share the wedding bliss except her.", "YES!!!! OP is too cheap to pay for pics so she feels it's ok to steal them in violation of the agreement DIL made with the photographer.   I see a future of LC and eventually NC between OP and her son and DIL.", "January", "And that is a possibility. Especially with mother's day around the corner.", "Not from January. It\u2019s been ages.", "If that was the case here, then DIL should have explained so. DIL probably also shouldn't have uploaded any pics to social media then either. Once they were uploaded to fb by the DIL, she has no control or say over who does what with the pictures.", "You wouldn't allow someone to take a photo off of Facebook?\n\nGuess what? You've lost control of that photo already. Facebook now owns rights to that photo.\n\nShe's not making money off this photo, she just wants a nice framed copy for her home.\n\nOP should just print the photo, frame it, and go on. If DIL wants to choose another she can pony up a better choice.", "I understand where you're coming from, but by uploading any pictures to social media, you don't get to dictate how they are used.", "Absolutely! She knows this. I would never ask her to pay.", "But it's it normal for the parents to not have access to photos? \n\nI very much do care that it was a wedding. It was a beautiful wedding. It was a very proud momma moment in more ways than one. My husband officiated and had everyone in tears. \n\nTo say that I looked \"good\" is probably an over statement but to say for the first time in my son's life there are photos he can be proud of his mother in, is not.", "Sorry but OP isn\u2019t just \u201cpeople\u201d though. She\u2019s the *mother of the groom* and wants the professional wedding pictures of her son\u2019s wedding day, that is not a crazy request. She asked for prints and was basically told no. Next logical step is to ask for a way to access those pictures so she can get prints herself and was still told no, without reason. \n\nI agree, unless OP is a professional photo editor there would be no reason to ask for/give access to all of them but given the situation I don\u2019t fault OP for asking at all. \n\nIt is an overreaching request, which is why OP narrowed down her request (after widening it because DIL \u201cdidn\u2019t approve\u201d of the ones she liked) to include those of herself, son and husband.", "Sorry. Our relationship is great! She doesn't allow a relationship with her own mother and I try to fill that role as needed. We go to lunch and dinner, have phone calls, etc. I give advice when asked and only when asked. \n\nI even mentioned we were going to move when we retire and she said absolutely not, we need you close by when we start a family.", "Maybe just talk to her? You know you offended her, give her the opportunity to talk to you about it. Apologize and explain where you were coming from. Likely because she used a professional photographer the photos are protected and she all ready has an agreement with the photographer. Her sharing the link with you to print off photos would violate her contract with the photographer. That is may be why they weren\u2019t shareable in the first place and why she got upset that you went out of your way to share them. I am sure you meant no harm, but you may have put her in an awkward position. Additionally, they may have all ready chosen a package and are limited to a certain numbers of poses and prints hence why she can\u2019t just print the ones you like. This seems like a misunderstanding that should be easy to clear up with good communication. But if it is a package/contract issue with the photographer, keep in mind you may not be able to get copies of the photos you were hoping to have.", "So you knew she wanted to be in control of her photos, and then you intentionally took that control away from her. \n\nYou did something you knew was going against her boundaries, so now she's throwing up additional boundaries. It's a very natural reaction to have your boundaries tested, especially when the person is doing it intentionally. \n\nYou're confused as to why she's not giving you any breathing room, but you've already admitted to using that leeway to intentionally violate her boundaries. \n\nYou may be thinking it's not that serious, it's just photos, they're photos of ME so I should have them, etc. But this likely isn't about the photos, it's a reaction to a pattern of boundary pushing.", "*\"I have some ownership of this.\"*  Huge understatement. \n\nI agree that there is a lot of this story that you are leaving out.  \n\nDid you consider that she can get in trouble for you printing a copyrighted photo?  (The photographer owns the image, she can only purchase them.)  You didn't say how long they have been married.  Some photographers take a very long time to print photos. \n\nYou also only specifically want one without her?  YTA just for that.  She didn't want you to do that because it was her wedding and she should be in the print you display.  Sure, get a secondary one with just the three of you, but you don't get only that and leave your DIL out.  Let her pick them.  I don't buy for a minute that no casual shots were taken.  People can't help themselves, and there was time pre- post-wedding where the photographer wouldn't have been there.  Why didn't you take one of yourself, or have someone take one of you, so you had one of yourself on your big day?  \n\nThis all reads \"me, me, I, I, ME!\"  You lost weight, you had a child who died, you, you, you.  It's not that the bride doesn't want to share the bliss... you don't want to.  I wonder when we will see the other half of this story.  You sound like a nightmare.", "There you go, that's where you went wrong. You shared photos that are not yours to share.", "> **I did copy and share photos of the wedding knowing that it was probably going to make her angry.**  \n>  \n>And the other shoe drops LOL.  Yeah, YTA here.  You did something KNOWING it would make her angry so you you bought some beachfront property at Lake Ahole aka MILZilla.  Did you REALLY ask for pics of just you, your husband, and son?", "I\u2019m a creative lol, I was reading this thinking - this seems reasonable unless you view it as a creative, in which case it\u2019s wildly disrespectful", "How long ago did they get the pictures? I just hired a photographer for my wedding, and an 8-12 week turnaround time is pretty standard.", "That\u2019s not a bad guess, especially because you say you have a good relationship with her and can\u2019t think of any other reason why she\u2019s doing this. It can\u2019t hurt to wait two weeks before taking any action.", "You don't get wedding pictures right after the wedding. I just hired a photographer, and 8-12 weeks is pretty standard for wedding pictures. The DIL has probably only had them for a few weeks at this point.", "I mean, I got married ten years ago, and last time I moved house I found a stash of thank you cards I never sent :( (sorry, everyone)\n\nBut no, you\u2019re right, I think I\u2019m being overly optimistic here.", "I didn't have time to really look through or distribute my wedding photos to family until like 2 years after my wedding. Some people just have more important things going on.", "Totally false. My contract allowed for posting on social media as long as each photo had the copyright on it. Physically printing was totally prohibited except for from the photographer's website. \n\nAlso, editing or cropping or changing the photos in any way is prohibited. There were family members who said directly to me that they wouldn't follow that rule, so they didn't get access to the photos.", "I realize that. But if it was taken by a professional, they should be recognized and paid for their work. I will happily route someone to said professional who can make their own decision about whether to charge for it. Some will say \u201cit\u2019s been bought once so I won\u2019t charge again, but I\u2019d like you to only use the high resolution version.\u201d Others may want compensation. It\u2019s a courtesy I can show a small business owner, and I do. \ud83d\ude42", "There are still social norms at play. I would not be trying to gatekeep the photos so much as ensure the original creator was given the compensation they feel is appropriate. Of course reasonable people may view this differently. This is where I land as my personal middle ground. \ud83d\ude42", "It\u2019s normal for the parents not to access the photos. And wedding pics can be really emotive. I hated mine. Ask your son what went wrong in the communication w DIL, and listen carefully to his answer.", "Zero people\u2014 ZERO\u2014 have the right to demand something that belongs to someone else.", "Ah okay gotcha, well then absolutely NTA! It seems pretty bizarre that she won\u2019t give you any access to photos but posts a bunch on Facebook.", "She took that control away from *herself* when she posted the photos to social media for anyone to see and use. Outside of pulling the photos down, she has no right to dictate what other people do and don't get to share/print from the internet.", "Very interesting! Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a", "It\u2019s on frickin FB!  DIL already shared the photos-to FACEBOOK!  If DIL didn\u2019t want them to be shared, why in the world would she SHARE them in FB?", "\u2018Bought beachfront property at lake ahole.\u2019 Um may I make a note of this? I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll have use for it in the future\u2026", "I'm a painter and thus highly opposed to theft or creative property.", "(I say this because it\u2019s exactly the kind of thing my own mum might do. I love her so much and I want her to have nice things, and sometimes she has done exactly this kind of thing - arranged for herself a cheap/poor-quality/\u2018good enough\u2019 version of something that I either would have loved to treat her to or was actually planning to treat her to, and then \u2018oh don\u2019t be daft, you don\u2019t need to spend that money, look, I\u2019ve already got one!\u2019)", "Still though, you explained all of this to people. You may also have agreed to the terms in the contract, but it would still hold no legal weight. If you put a picture on social media, anyone that can see it can download it, copy it, print it, whatever they want as long as copyright laws are followed. It would be an AH move for sure, but as they didn't sign the contract, they are not bound to it.", "That is true. The weird thing with OPs situation is the lack of any reason from DIL. There are a number of valid reasons for her actions, it's just weird she apparently won't give one.", "Dude\u2026 Learn to read and comprehend a comment and not project your own mommy issues here for fucks sake. \n\nOP NEVER DEMANDED ANYTHING, SHE ASKED.  If you can point out where OP demanded anything I\u2019ll eat crow. \n\nFYI, those pictures likely *do NOT belong to the bride* they are copyrighted material, owned by the photographer and *printing rights* shared with the groom and bride. Unless the photographer gave up their copyright to the bride and groom, but that is not likely.", "Your opinion is both unecessary and unwanted. Have a good day", "> she has no right to dictate what other people do and don't get to share/print from the internet.\n\nLegally? Of course she doesn't.\n\nIn terms of social norms? Of course she's allowed to have that boundary. Putting photos in a place where your friends and family can see them is not implicit consent to do whatever with them.", "I gift it too you freely-- and hope you never live there LOL", "That's the question I have.  It's in a contract to post to social media but there is no way to control who prints those photos from there. I mean, block folks who say they're going to do it anyway, but 1 person not saying anything, and boom photos are out. Also if a person has a public account, anyone could just say yoink and have a pic of you.  So does the photographer have a reasonable expectation that no one will just order prints from Snapfish or even print at home.", "It IS. And like\u2026they\u2019re wedding photos? Everyone was there? It is entirely normal for the parents of the couple to want a family photo from that day. I can understand saying, \u201cplease don\u2019t just pull this from Facebook, please contact the photographer for how to proceed and properly credit them\u201d or saying, \u201cI\u2019d be glad to buy the high resolution version of this image for you so you can print it.\u201d I can totally see that, so I\u2019m trying to think of whether there\u2019s anything along those lines going on? It sounds like the DIL\u2019s behavior is just odd.", "I'm not sure how you get to decide someone else's opinion is unnecessary and unwanted.", "I am absolutely not a lawyer, but my thinking is it would just come down to copyright law and maybe fair use. Meaning anyone could download, print, and maybe even edit as long as it was for personal use. Again though, knowingly doing something like that may be legal, but would still be an AH thing to do.", "Because it was a reply to me and that's my feelings?"]}
