Seems odd to me but maybe I'm behind the times.", "Thank you for that! So sharing wedding photos with family is not a thing any more for some brides? I'm old school and trying to learn etiquette. I would have never guessed that I couldn't have pictures. Very interesting and good to know. \n\nSo when family and friends ask to see photos, what would be a good response?", "I did put in a nice amount for this wedding but not the point. I want photos of all but if she is going to refuse, then give me access to photos of myself, husband and son. I have shared photos of them as a couple and gushed about how beautiful she is.

I\u2019m also going to assume the pictures the bride posted contained many pictures that included her, the bride so MIL already has pictures of the bride/bride and groom. And since MIL was still asking for pictures of HER ONLY SON ON HIS WEDDING DAY it\u2019s safe to say DIL posted no pictures of just the husband/husband and son/son and mother. Which is fucking weird.", "We definitely helped pay for the wedding. \n\nDid she feel upstaged? I sure hope not! She is beautiful! Beautiful is never a word anyone would use to describe me. I'm a 60 year old woman who never took photos. It was lightly suggested I lose weight and I took it to heart. For them, myself and for future grand kids. And let's just say I knew she wanted perfection for this wedding. This was a no kids allowed, bridal party not allowed to stand in the ceremony because it could ruin pictures. I'm not saying she was a bridezilla but definitely wanted perfection. \n\nNo, I definitely let my son be his own person. I hope and pray that I did nothing to offend her before the wedding.

You order prints from the photographer, that's the only way you're allowed to print them in many contracts.\n\nMy new in-laws also wanted access to all our photos, but thankfully stopped pushing when I explained the above. And I'm sorry, you're asking for a photo \"dump\", not just a nice photo of you to put on fb or whatever. Sorry, I didn't pay $5k for professional photos for aunt millie to post pics all over her home or social media of me, the bride, looking awkward with a weird double chin just because her son is in them. Only photos where the bride & groom look good will be seen.", "Professional photographers don\u2019t want people to print off their photos.

If we\u2019re being honest, I understand her to a point. I\u2019m pretty protective of a professional\u2019s work; I wouldn\u2019t allow someone to just take a professional photo off my Facebook for their own use either.

So I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with your DIL.", "So you're willing to PAY the photographer to have the photos you want printed?", ">She has stated that she will print me a professional photo but did not approve of the photo that I chose.\n\nWhat was the photo of that you selected, if you don't mind me asking?", "But she's not selling them! Fair use is a valid defense, and if she's making a copy for display at her home, I think the copyright issue is a lot less severe and not asshole worthy.", "Exactly what I was trying to do. I would love photos with her as well! But I'll take anything I can get.", "Wait. What? Lightly suggested to lose weight?? Nope sorry. That is not okay.  You sound very lovely and trying extra hard at this relationship but that confirms for me that you are NTA here and we are missing something in this story from her end.", "First of all, congratulations on the weight loss. That is tremendous and takes a lot of dedication and discipline. 75lbs is amazing! That being said, I\u2019d be willing to bet she\u2019s probably peeved about that. \n\nInfo: Did you get a lot of compliments on your weight loss while at the wedding? If so I\u2019d almost guarantee that\u2019s the issue.\n\nMore info: The pictures she shared on social media, how many of them were you in? Were any of just you and your son?", "That\u2019s waaaaay too intimate to be memorialised on your inlaws wall forever. I\u2019d be embarrassed if I had to see that in print every time I visited my inlaws. Not sure why she put it on Fb.", "Yes, professional photos cannot be shared and used without consent. This is standard digital copyright stuff. She is locking you out because you overstepped. I have to do it to my MiL all the time. I put her in timeout until she behaves and then she gets access to grandkids again.", "It may be she doesn\u2019t want them shared, it may also be that she has agreed with the professional photographer not to share. I would tell people that she had a professional photographer so there are no photos of the wedding you\u2019re able to share until she\u2019s finished printing and distributing and encourage them to reach out to her or your son directly if they want to see.", "It sounds like OP doesn\u2019t care that it was a wedding.  Just that it was pics with her son, and she looked good in them.", "Why would anyone give people access to their private wedding photos that they paid for? It\u2019s a crazy overreaching request.  There are tons of photos in there that might be private to the couple, not flattering for certain people, etc. There is literally no reason the mother should have access to them.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA simply because she posted them on Facebook, bur find it curious you didn\u2019t answer my question.", "OP should just ask the wedding photographer if she can buy prints off her.", "Nope, leaving them be. We occasionally have dinner together, etc. They have always included us and we love them for that. \n\nI truly am clueless.  This hit out of left field. I thought it was odd that she posted pics but they weren't shareable. I did copy and share photos of the wedding knowing that it was probably going to make her angry. So I do have some ownership in this. I just need to know if it's natural for the bride to not want anyone else to share the wedding bliss except her.", "YES!!!! OP is too cheap to pay for pics so she feels it's ok to steal them in violation of the agreement DIL made with the photographer.   I see a future of LC and eventually NC between OP and her son and DIL.", "January", "And that is a possibility. Especially with mother's day around the corner.", "Not from January. It\u2019s been ages.", "If that was the case here, then DIL should have explained so. DIL probably also shouldn't have uploaded any pics to social media then either. Once they were uploaded to fb by the DIL, she has no control or say over who does what with the pictures.", "You wouldn't allow someone to take a photo off of Facebook?\n\nGuess what? You've lost control of that photo already. Facebook now owns rights to that photo.\n\nShe's not making money off this photo, she just wants a nice framed copy for her home.\n\nOP should just print the photo, frame it, and go on. If DIL wants to choose another she can pony up a better choice.", "I understand where you're coming from, but by uploading any pictures to social media, you don't get to dictate how they are used.", "Absolutely! She knows this. I would never ask her to pay.", "But it's it normal for the parents to not have access to photos? \n\nI very much do care that it was a wedding. It was a beautiful wedding. It was a very proud momma moment in more ways than one. My husband officiated and had everyone in tears. \n\nTo say that I looked \"good\" is probably an over statement but to say for the first time in my son's life there are photos he can be proud of his mother in, is not.", "Sorry but OP isn\u2019t just \u201cpeople\u201d though. She\u2019s the *mother of the groom* and wants the professional wedding pictures of her son\u2019s wedding day, that is not a crazy request. She asked for prints and was basically told no. Next logical step is to ask for a way to access those pictures so she can get prints herself and was still told no, without reason. \n\nI agree, unless OP is a professional photo editor there would be no reason to ask for/give access to all of them but given the situation I don\u2019t fault OP for asking at all. \n\nIt is an overreaching request, which is why OP narrowed down her request (after widening it because DIL \u201cdidn\u2019t approve\u201d of the ones she liked) to include those of herself, son and husband.", "Sorry. Our relationship is great! She doesn't allow a relationship with her own mother and I try to fill that role as needed. We go to lunch and dinner, have phone calls, etc. I give advice when asked and only when asked. \n\nI even mentioned we were going to move when we retire and she said absolutely not, we need you close by when we start a family.", "Maybe just talk to her? You know you offended her, give her the opportunity to talk to you about it. Apologize and explain where you were coming from. Likely because she used a professional photographer the photos are protected and she all ready has an agreement with the photographer. Her sharing the link with you to print off photos would violate her contract with the photographer. That is may be why they weren\u2019t shareable in the first place and why she got upset that you went out of your way to share them. I am sure you meant no harm, but you may have put her in an awkward position. Additionally, they may have all ready chosen a package and are limited to a certain numbers of poses and prints hence why she can\u2019t just print the ones you like. This seems like a misunderstanding that should be easy to clear up with good communication. But if it is a package/contract issue with the photographer, keep in mind you may not be able to get copies of the photos you were hoping to have.", "So you knew she wanted to be in control of her photos, and then you intentionally took that control away from her. \n\nYou did something you knew was going against her boundaries, so now she's throwing up additional boundaries. It's a very natural reaction to have your boundaries tested, especially when the person is doing it intentionally. \n\nYou're confused as to why she's not giving you any breathing room, but you've already admitted to using that leeway to intentionally violate her boundaries. \n\nYou may be thinking it's not that serious, it's just photos, they're photos of ME so I should have them, etc. But this likely isn't about the photos, it's a reaction to a pattern of boundary pushing.", "*\"I have some ownership of this.\"*  Huge understatement. \n\nI agree that there is a lot of this story that you are leaving out.  \n\nDid you consider that she can get in trouble for you printing a copyrighted photo?  (The photographer owns the image, she can only purchase them.)  You didn't say how long they have been married.  Some photographers take a very long time to print photos. \n\nYou also only specifically want one without her?  YTA just for that.  She didn't want you to do that because it was her wedding and she should be in the print you display.  Sure, get a secondary one with just the three of you, but you don't get only that and leave your DIL out.  Let her pick them.  I don't buy for a minute that no casual shots were taken.  People can't help themselves, and there was time pre- post-wedding where the photographer wouldn't have been there.  Why didn't you take one of yourself, or have someone take one of you, so you had one of yourself on your big day?  \n\nThis all reads \"me, me, I, I, ME!\"  You lost weight, you had a child who died, you, you, you.  It's not that the bride doesn't want to share the bliss... you don't want to.  I wonder when we will see the other half of this story.  You sound like a nightmare.", "There you go, that's where you went wrong. You shared photos that are not yours to share.", "> **I did copy and share photos of the wedding knowing that it was probably going to make her angry.**  \n>  \n>And the other shoe drops LOL.  Yeah, YTA here.  You did something KNOWING it would make her angry so you you bought some beachfront property at Lake Ahole aka MILZilla.  Did you REALLY ask for pics of just you, your husband, and son?", "I\u2019m a creative lol, I was reading this thinking - this seems reasonable unless you view it as a creative, in which case it\u2019s wildly disrespectful", "How long ago did they get the pictures? I just hired a photographer for my wedding, and an 8-12 week turnaround time is pretty standard.", "That\u2019s not a bad guess, especially because you say you have a good relationship with her and can\u2019t think of any other reason why she\u2019s doing this. It can\u2019t hurt to wait two weeks before taking any action.", "You don't get wedding pictures right after the wedding. I just hired a photographer, and 8-12 weeks is pretty standard for wedding pictures. The DIL has probably only had them for a few weeks at this point.", "I mean, I got married ten years ago, and last time I moved house I found a stash of thank you cards I never sent :( (sorry, everyone)\n\nBut no, you\u2019re right, I think I\u2019m being overly optimistic here.", "I didn't have time to really look through or distribute my wedding photos to family until like 2 years after my wedding. Some people just have more important things going on.", "Totally false. My contract allowed for posting on social media as long as each photo had the copyright on it. Physically printing was totally prohibited except for from the photographer's website. \n\nAlso, editing or cropping or changing the photos in any way is prohibited. There were family members who said directly to me that they wouldn't follow that rule, so they didn't get access to the photos.", "I realize that.

It's in a contract to post to social media but there is no way to control who prints those photos from there. I mean, block folks who say they're going to do it anyway, but 1 person not saying anything, and boom photos are out.

Obviously DIL posting the pictures on SM (if done legally) is fine\u2026 but it really is telling OP still had to ask for any pictures of herself, her son, and or her husband *after the SM post was made*.\n\nLet me explain, 9/10 if a bride posts \u201csome\u201d pictures of their wedding day that\u2019s at least 10-20 pictures usually way way more and yet not a single one was of just the groom and his family? No mother son dance? No father straightening his son\u2019s tie while mom looks on lovingly? Those photos are pretty standard to include in wedding posts. Yet DIL posted none, that was 100% intentional.\n\nI think she intentionally did that because people *might* comment about OP in DIL\u2019s comments AND she didn\u2019t want OP to repost the pictures on her own account where it\u2019s more likely people would comment about the bride *as well as* OP\u2019s weight loss.", "Totally agreed. I just needed to know how much of an apology was owed. I am a person who says sorry for my errors. Mostly just trying to understand perspective from others.", "Ah, so you are TA, and a massive one. Stop playing the victim.", "> I thought it was odd that she posted pics but they weren't shareable. I did copy and share photos of the wedding knowing that it was probably going to make her angry. So I do have some ownership in this.\n\nYou own all of it.  She has a contract.  That explains her rights.  How she can use the photos.  And sharing was probably not there.  You taking them.  And sharing them.  Puts her in a bad place.  One she can be sued for.   \n    \nOf course she is pissed at you.", "Agreed.  Still no reason to hold the photos hostage.  Very odd", "I agree with NTA but no, unless OP paid the photographer and has the files, she does not. Once your kids are grown that argument is invalid. No one has a single right to anything of another.", "Uh, no. I do think DIL is being weird, but mom didn't pay the photographer. If she has her own pictures from her phone, fine, but the married couple gets to decide about the professional pictures.", "I mean, unless you are the one providing the money, then no you don't have rights to any photos. I don't think she's an a****** for taking and sharing them, But saying that she has just as much right as the person who legally owns the photos is just wrong.", "Nope it's pretty simple. Don't post shit online if you don't want people to see or share it. \n\nIt's not a very abstract construct.", "digital packages are not print quality", "The thing about photography though is regardless of who paid for them the photographer retains the copyright to the photos and that does give them the power to dictate if the paying party can print or share them on SM. Most wedding photographers share \u201cprint rights\u201d with the people getting married. This is done via a signed contract that includes specifications about printing the photos and what must be included in a social media post sharing the photos. Very rarely do wedding photographers completely sign over the entire copyright to the couple.", "Yes, the photographer can have a contract that prohibits printing/sharing. You may have to buy prints from the photographer or give the photographer photo credit if you want to use them on social media, for example.", "You have clearly never read a photography contract for a wedding. Getting digital and print rights is not automatic. It's a specific line item.", "Whether or not this situation gets resolved, I think you and your husband should get dolled up in your wedding guest attire and have some professional photos taken of just the two of you.", "Not only did DIL share them on SM\u2026 She shared them with **no watermark and gave no credit to the photographer** essentially nulling the photographers copyright ownership of the photos and likely violating their contract.", "is it a little much refusing to talk to you or give you any wiggle room? yes! but i would be a little uncomfortable if my MIL printed out that picture (or any picture i didn't love) especially if she wasn't even in it!", "I don\u2019t know if this helps, but I think it actually helped after they had kids because our side of The family is always willing to help with childcare and can be more accommodating to their schedules since they have kids and the rest of us don\u2019t have family in law to coordinate around. SIL\u2019s kids are obsessed with my mom and love being with her. Good luck! Again, I\u2019m sorry.", "For sure, I\u2019m just saying that it could still hurt someone\u2019s feelings to imply that 35 years of raising kids isn\u2019t worth even asking, and random strangers on the internet know more. If The comparison were between a doctor, or child development specialist\u2019s advice, sure, but just having a child doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they know more. People take the bad advice of people who don\u2019t know anything on social media literally all day every day.", "I was already of the opinion that DIL's behavior was directed at curating what everyone else was **allowed to remember** about the wedding, and this is a pretty coherent supposition as to why.", "Right?! I feel like the son is getting off the hook by \u201cstaying neutral\u201d. You don\u2019t get to stay neutral when your brand new wife and your mom are having a disagreement like this. IMO he\u2019s the asshole.", "Lol get over it, once you share photos on social it means you want them to be shared. There\u2019s a damn \u201cShare\u201d button. The DIL is being weird.", "No, she owns them. I helped her negotiate.", "OP commented it she wore a dress specifically approved by DIL.", "this is important info imo", "These digital packages are high rez digital files of photos taken on a digital camera. They are more than high quality enough to print.", "Yes they are", "The fuck? The 800mp professional photos are only good for viewing online?", "If you paid for that they are.", "It sounds like OP asked DIL to have one printed but she vetoed it because she didn\u2019t approve of the photo OP selected.", "I wouldn\u2019t use a photographer that had a contract like this.", "Is that like an US thing? I never even signed a contract and the photographer couldn't care less how I use my photos afterwards.", "Wow, who would pay to have to post their own pictures with a water mark? Hell no.", "Meh, most wedding photographers offer packages where you own the rights to all the pictures they take.", "That is hopeful! Thank you for sharing.", "lol good job at deleting your comment but Not sure why you went to attacking me but, im being a jerk because i don't take my MIL's advice that could risk my babies life? I always let her say what she wants and then inform her that's not actually recommended now, and 99% of the time im educating her. Thankfully we have a great relationship and she always listens and learns. She sees my baby multiple times a week and we put spending time with her as our #1 priority so no need to worry about myself or my baby's relationship with my in-laws. \ud83d\ude0a", "Yeah, i think it just depends what kind of questions is she asking people? and do you know she is taking directly what they say and implementing it before confirming with a pediatrician? Sleep guidelines are different, solids are different, most things that impacts babies health are no where close. So unless your mother is staying up to date on current information or has in the last five years raised a baby, the fact that she's raised kids for 35 years doesn't really matter, and when you're that far out of the baby stage you probably don't actually remember what your baby needed, and all babies needs are vastly different. It's fair for your mom to be hurt but can also be true that her advice is more than likely unhelpful and can potentially be harmful to baby.", "all of that to say what's the point of asking if most of the information you are going to receive will be wrong?", "She probably had privacy settings engaged on the photos though. So they were only intended for a specific group of people, not \"anyone\"", "Oh no. If any of my friends or family take my photos off of social media and repost them, especially knowing I don't want that, they are no longer allowed to see my social media. \n\nJust because something is legally allowed doesn't make it right. You CAN and SHOULD be allowed to post something and not wonder if your mother in law is going to share it to a bunch of people you don't know.", "That\u2019s crap. It\u2019s a well established standard that you don\u2019t copy photos from your kids\u2019 Facebook accounts without their consent.", "I cut off contact with my sister after she sent photos from my wedding to my abuser. You should apologize to your DIL, especially if you want to repair that relationship.", "Well.  If she owns them.  And she knows you copied them.  Without permission.  You can be sued.   \n    \nYou are still the AH.  And still stealing.", "Oh missed that ty", "My cousin was married in 2013. There were some really great family photos taken that day.My mother died in 2019, there weren't many recent photos of her. My cousin reached out to the photographer to see if she could get a higher resolution version of a group picture my mom was in so we could crop it and use it for the memorial service. Not only did the photographer send her the file, he sent her an edited version. It looked like my mother was the only one in the picture, he also got rid of a visible bra strap. He did this for free and would not accept payment.So not all photographers are dicks.", "Totally up to you. There are plenty who don\u2019t. Just replying to the previous commenter who said a photographer can\u2019t do that\u2026they certainly can.", "Right, I deleted because I didn\u2019t intend to be attacking. I also never at any point said you should take their advice. I said that if you are opening it up to people who are equally as unqualified to provide medical advice, what would it hurt to ask just to be kind.", "She\u2019s asking for photos of her husband and son. The photos are of OP", "Delete your asinine comment about how OP is at fault for her pattern of boundary pushing, then.", "So if you have a picture of you and your friend on social media and they share that photo, you block them? I say they have just as much right to that photo as you do since they are in it also.", "It\u2019s also not legally allowed! Copyright \ud83e\udee0", "I\u2019m pretty sure social norms in America say that a mother is allowed to have pictures of their child\u2019s wedding printed out.", "Well a photographer can put whatever they want in their contract. And as you say customers can choose to work with photographers with reasons terms in their contract.", "Do you have children? Are you used to almost everyone you see give unsolicited and incorrect advice at every opportunity? It's very tiring and i for sure wouldnt go out of my way to get even more false advice. and it can be very uncomfortable to tell your MIL they're wrong, thankfully i'm close with mine and she has showed me she respects me as a mother. Why is your mom entitled to have her DIL ask for advice because it makes her feel better? DIL can ask whoever she wants, just because your mom is her husbands mother does not mean she automatically is going to be gone to for advice or that it should be taken. I said your mom is fine for feeling hurt, but it's 100% wrong to ask or expect a mom that's already going through parenthood to ask for advice, that she clearly does not want, just to be kind.", "and i don't ask my MIL for advice, most of it is unsolicited and incorrect. If she didn't respect my answers i would have told her my parenting is not up for discussion so don't give me any advice. I text my friends with babies and if i still don't feel great go to a pediatrician. Or look up some research! this isn't about if she should be posting on facebook, she could go to a bank and ask for baby advice. that's her RIGHT as a mother and it's kind of weird that it's expected for her to ask your mom for advice just because she married in your family.", "Someone else (a professional photographer) took the pictures.  OP has literally ZERO right legally or morally to download the pics and print them.  DIL asked her not to do that and by OP's own admission she did it anyway KNOWING it would anger DIL.", "Nah, I can talk to OP without being forced to have a debate with everyone who drags their knuckles across the keyboard at me", "This would be true if she hadn\u2019t already posted them on Facebook. At that point, anyone can do anything they want with the photos. All she can do now is take the photos off of social media."]}
