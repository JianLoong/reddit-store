Seems odd to me but maybe I'm behind the times.", "Thank you for that! So sharing wedding photos with family is not a thing any more for some brides? I'm old school and trying to learn etiquette. I would have never guessed that I couldn't have pictures. Very interesting and good to know. \n\nSo when family and friends ask to see photos, what would be a good response?", "I did put in a nice amount for this wedding but not the point. I want photos of all but if she is going to refuse, then give me access to photos of myself, husband and son. I have shared photos of them as a couple and gushed about how beautiful she is.

I\u2019m also going to assume the pictures the bride posted contained many pictures that included her, the bride so MIL already has pictures of the bride/bride and groom. And since MIL was still asking for pictures of HER ONLY SON ON HIS WEDDING DAY it\u2019s safe to say DIL posted no pictures of just the husband/husband and son/son and mother. Which is fucking weird.", "We definitely helped pay for the wedding. \n\nDid she feel upstaged? I sure hope not! She is beautiful! Beautiful is never a word anyone would use to describe me. I'm a 60 year old woman who never took photos. It was lightly suggested I lose weight and I took it to heart. For them, myself and for future grand kids. And let's just say I knew she wanted perfection for this wedding. This was a no kids allowed, bridal party not allowed to stand in the ceremony because it could ruin pictures. I'm not saying she was a bridezilla but definitely wanted perfection. \n\nNo, I definitely let my son be his own person. I hope and pray that I did nothing to offend her before the wedding.

You order prints from the photographer, that's the only way you're allowed to print them in many contracts.\n\nMy new in-laws also wanted access to all our photos, but thankfully stopped pushing when I explained the above. And I'm sorry, you're asking for a photo \"dump\", not just a nice photo of you to put on fb or whatever. Sorry, I didn't pay $5k for professional photos for aunt millie to post pics all over her home or social media of me, the bride, looking awkward with a weird double chin just because her son is in them. Only photos where the bride & groom look good will be seen.", "Professional photographers don\u2019t want people to print off their photos.

If we\u2019re being honest, I understand her to a point. I\u2019m pretty protective of a professional\u2019s work; I wouldn\u2019t allow someone to just take a professional photo off my Facebook for their own use either.

Fair use is a valid defense, and if she's making a copy for display at her home, I think the copyright issue is a lot less severe and not asshole worthy.", "Exactly what I was trying to do. I would love photos with her as well! But I'll take anything I can get.", "Wait. What? Lightly suggested to lose weight?? Nope sorry. That is not okay.  You sound very lovely and trying extra hard at this relationship but that confirms for me that you are NTA here and we are missing something in this story from her end.", "First of all, congratulations on the weight loss. That is tremendous and takes a lot of dedication and discipline. 75lbs is amazing! That being said, I\u2019d be willing to bet she\u2019s probably peeved about that. \n\nInfo: Did you get a lot of compliments on your weight loss while at the wedding? If so I\u2019d almost guarantee that\u2019s the issue.\n\nMore info: The pictures she shared on social media, how many of them were you in? Were any of just you and your son?", "That\u2019s waaaaay too intimate to be memorialised on your inlaws wall forever. I\u2019d be embarrassed if I had to see that in print every time I visited my inlaws. Not sure why she put it on Fb.", "Yes, professional photos cannot be shared and used without consent. This is standard digital copyright stuff. She is locking you out because you overstepped. I have to do it to my MiL all the time. I put her in timeout until she behaves and then she gets access to grandkids again.", "It may be she doesn\u2019t want them shared, it may also be that she has agreed with the professional photographer not to share. I would tell people that she had a professional photographer so there are no photos of the wedding you\u2019re able to share until she\u2019s finished printing and distributing and encourage them to reach out to her or your son directly if they want to see.", "It sounds like OP doesn\u2019t care that it was a wedding.  Just that it was pics with her son, and she looked good in them.", "Why would anyone give people access to their private wedding photos that they paid for? It\u2019s a crazy overreaching request.  There are tons of photos in there that might be private to the couple, not flattering for certain people, etc. There is literally no reason the mother should have access to them.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA simply because she posted them on Facebook, bur find it curious you didn\u2019t answer my question.", "OP should just ask the wedding photographer if she can buy prints off her.", "Nope, leaving them be. We occasionally have dinner together, etc. They have always included us and we love them for that. \n\nI truly am clueless.  This hit out of left field. I thought it was odd that she posted pics but they weren't shareable. I did copy and share photos of the wedding knowing that it was probably going to make her angry. So I do have some ownership in this. I just need to know if it's natural for the bride to not want anyone else to share the wedding bliss except her.", "YES!!!! OP is too cheap to pay for pics so she feels it's ok to steal them in violation of the agreement DIL made with the photographer.   I see a future of LC and eventually NC between OP and her son and DIL.", "January", "And that is a possibility. Especially with mother's day around the corner.", "Not from January. It\u2019s been ages.", "If that was the case here, then DIL should have explained so. DIL probably also shouldn't have uploaded any pics to social media then either. Once they were uploaded to fb by the DIL, she has no control or say over who does what with the pictures.", "You wouldn't allow someone to take a photo off of Facebook?\n\nGuess what? You've lost control of that photo already. Facebook now owns rights to that photo.\n\nShe's not making money off this photo, she just wants a nice framed copy for her home.\n\nOP should just print the photo, frame it, and go on. If DIL wants to choose another she can pony up a better choice.", "I understand where you're coming from, but by uploading any pictures to social media, you don't get to dictate how they are used.", "Absolutely! She knows this. I would never ask her to pay.", "But it's it normal for the parents to not have access to photos? \n\nI very much do care that it was a wedding. It was a beautiful wedding. It was a very proud momma moment in more ways than one. My husband officiated and had everyone in tears. \n\nTo say that I looked \"good\" is probably an over statement but to say for the first time in my son's life there are photos he can be proud of his mother in, is not.", "Sorry but OP isn\u2019t just \u201cpeople\u201d though. She\u2019s the *mother of the groom* and wants the professional wedding pictures of her son\u2019s wedding day, that is not a crazy request. She asked for prints and was basically told no. Next logical step is to ask for a way to access those pictures so she can get prints herself and was still told no, without reason. \n\nI agree, unless OP is a professional photo editor there would be no reason to ask for/give access to all of them but given the situation I don\u2019t fault OP for asking at all. \n\nIt is an overreaching request, which is why OP narrowed down her request (after widening it because DIL \u201cdidn\u2019t approve\u201d of the ones she liked) to include those of herself, son and husband.", "Sorry. Our relationship is great! She doesn't allow a relationship with her own mother and I try to fill that role as needed. We go to lunch and dinner, have phone calls, etc. I give advice when asked and only when asked. \n\nI even mentioned we were going to move when we retire and she said absolutely not, we need you close by when we start a family.", "Maybe just talk to her? You know you offended her, give her the opportunity to talk to you about it. Apologize and explain where you were coming from. Likely because she used a professional photographer the photos are protected and she all ready has an agreement with the photographer. Her sharing the link with you to print off photos would violate her contract with the photographer. That is may be why they weren\u2019t shareable in the first place and why she got upset that you went out of your way to share them. I am sure you meant no harm, but you may have put her in an awkward position. Additionally, they may have all ready chosen a package and are limited to a certain numbers of poses and prints hence why she can\u2019t just print the ones you like. This seems like a misunderstanding that should be easy to clear up with good communication. But if it is a package/contract issue with the photographer, keep in mind you may not be able to get copies of the photos you were hoping to have.", "So you knew she wanted to be in control of her photos, and then you intentionally took that control away from her. \n\nYou did something you knew was going against her boundaries, so now she's throwing up additional boundaries. It's a very natural reaction to have your boundaries tested, especially when the person is doing it intentionally. \n\nYou're confused as to why she's not giving you any breathing room, but you've already admitted to using that leeway to intentionally violate her boundaries. \n\nYou may be thinking it's not that serious, it's just photos, they're photos of ME so I should have them, etc. But this likely isn't about the photos, it's a reaction to a pattern of boundary pushing.", "*\"I have some ownership of this.\"*  Huge understatement. \n\nI agree that there is a lot of this story that you are leaving out.  \n\nDid you consider that she can get in trouble for you printing a copyrighted photo?  (The photographer owns the image, she can only purchase them.)  You didn't say how long they have been married.  Some photographers take a very long time to print photos. \n\nYou also only specifically want one without her?  YTA just for that.  She didn't want you to do that because it was her wedding and she should be in the print you display.  Sure, get a secondary one with just the three of you, but you don't get only that and leave your DIL out.  Let her pick them.  I don't buy for a minute that no casual shots were taken.  People can't help themselves, and there was time pre- post-wedding where the photographer wouldn't have been there.  Why didn't you take one of yourself, or have someone take one of you, so you had one of yourself on your big day?  \n\nThis all reads \"me, me, I, I, ME!\"  You lost weight, you had a child who died, you, you, you.  It's not that the bride doesn't want to share the bliss... you don't want to.  I wonder when we will see the other half of this story.  You sound like a nightmare.", "There you go, that's where you went wrong. You shared photos that are not yours to share.", "> **I did copy and share photos of the wedding knowing that it was probably going to make her angry.**  \n>  \n>And the other shoe drops LOL.  Yeah, YTA here.  You did something KNOWING it would make her angry so you you bought some beachfront property at Lake Ahole aka MILZilla.  Did you REALLY ask for pics of just you, your husband, and son?", "I\u2019m a creative lol, I was reading this thinking - this seems reasonable unless you view it as a creative, in which case it\u2019s wildly disrespectful", "How long ago did they get the pictures? I just hired a photographer for my wedding, and an 8-12 week turnaround time is pretty standard.", "That\u2019s not a bad guess, especially because you say you have a good relationship with her and can\u2019t think of any other reason why she\u2019s doing this. It can\u2019t hurt to wait two weeks before taking any action.", "You don't get wedding pictures right after the wedding. I just hired a photographer, and 8-12 weeks is pretty standard for wedding pictures. The DIL has probably only had them for a few weeks at this point.", "I mean, I got married ten years ago, and last time I moved house I found a stash of thank you cards I never sent :( (sorry, everyone)\n\nBut no, you\u2019re right, I think I\u2019m being overly optimistic here.", "I didn't have time to really look through or distribute my wedding photos to family until like 2 years after my wedding. Some people just have more important things going on.", "Totally false. My contract allowed for posting on social media as long as each photo had the copyright on it. Physically printing was totally prohibited except for from the photographer's website. \n\nAlso, editing or cropping or changing the photos in any way is prohibited. There were family members who said directly to me that they wouldn't follow that rule, so they didn't get access to the photos.", "I realize that.

I will happily route someone to said professional who can make their own decision about whether to charge for it.

It's in a contract to post to social media but there is no way to control who prints those photos from there. I mean, block folks who say they're going to do it anyway, but 1 person not saying anything, and boom photos are out.

Some people, myself included, do not want their pictures shared with every Tom, Dick, and Harry.", "YTA", "Why haven\u2019t you asked your son for the link?", "There\u2019s NFW.  No wedding photographer would let the MIL print photos without the bride\u2019s permission.", "We got familiar photos done and I had to argue with the photographer to be able to use one on Christmas cards.", "Agreed. It is a control thing. I pretend it doesn\u2019t bother me now. Trying to keep the peace. Good luck!", "And he son apparently doesn\u2019t care enough to get involved.", "Claiming \"BOUNDARIES \" doesn't always entitle someone to get their way, nor does it always justify getting your way just because you claimed \"boundary \"\n\nNot allowing the mother of your husband, and wife of your wedding officiant,  to be able to print a single picture of themselves from the wedding (especially after posting them on social media, and given OP is willing to pay for them) is not a boundary,  it's a power play.", "It\u2019s a wedding. Not a grandchild. It\u2019s not some appalling thing to share pics from your kid\u2019s wedding.", "It seems like OP is printing them out and physically showing them to people. Even if she is sharing them on social media, she made it pretty clear that the pictures are only of herself, husband, and son and don\u2019t include DIL. Even if the photos are legally her son and DIL\u2019s, it\u2019s fucked up IMO to try and prevent somebody from sharing their own picture on their own social media. It\u2019s a pic of OP from an event where she was forbidden from taking any pics of herself. DIL is being a controlling bridezilla IMO.", "Assuming it\u2019s not specified in the contract, I am 100% sure most, if not all, wedding photographers would let MIL print the photos without the bride\u2019s permission, *if the groom gave permission instead*. Since he seems to be neutral in this situation I think it\u2019s worth a shot to ask *him*. \n\nThese photos aren\u2019t just the bride\u2019s to share and print for who she wants. They\u2019re the groom grooms too to share and print for who he wants too. That being said, I\u2019m not sure why OP hasn\u2019t just asked *her son* to get the prints for her.", "That\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. People spend thousands of dollars on photos, especially wedding photos. The nerve of a photographer to try and tell someone how they can use a pic they payed through the nose for.", "Have this conversation with someone else", "You are being a JUST NO MIL. Stop stomping her boundaries or you\u2019re going to be excluded in the future.", "It's appalling to share anyone's photos without their permission.", "If OP is anything like my mother she has a WIDE OPEN FB, posting everything publicly, while DIL likely has her photos for a private audience.", "Not sure why you feel personal insults are  necessary (and I am not a dude and had a great mother), but since you asked:  Definition of demand from the dictionary - \u201cto ask or call for with authority : claim as due or just.\u201d  Translation:  exactly what she\u2019s doing.", "Sorry, boundaries!!!!!!!!", "I seem to be a bit confused. What is \u201cwhatever\u201d in this case? What did she do with the photos?", "Dude, she didn\u2019t demand shit. She is not the authority here OP\u2019s DIL is as she is the one with the pictures. I didn\u2019t ask for the definition of demand I asked where OP demanded anything, which you failed in answering, because OP didn\u2019t demand jack shit. \n\nShe wants the pictures from her son\u2019s wedding WHY is that such a problem?", "Then state that\u2019s how you feel instead of spewing crap", "This is a comment section ofc people will reply to you regardless of if you deem it unnecessary. Like the other person said if you feel like it's unnecessary say it like that instead of making it sound like a universal opinion or something.\n\nEdit: I'm probably being too serious about this but it irks me when say things of the same nature as 'who asked' in a comment section."]}
