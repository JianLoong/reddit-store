It's not your fault that you live a \"dull\" life, you know that, right?\n\nI'm really not sure what to make of your ex. \"Falling out of love\" with someone because they don't have a certain amount of friends is just...odd behaviour.\n\nRegardless, you do not have to wear a fit bit connected to his phone, even if it's a good reason. Which I'm not sure if this case is or not.\n\nIt seems like your ex has issues, to be brutally honest.", "I'm going to go with NAH here.\n\nYour ex-husband clearly still cares about you even though the marriage didn't work out and finding you unresponsive was likely traumatic for him. Him wanting you to wear the fitbit he can monitor is likely a response to that. It's not the healthiest and he should probably seek therapy to deal with it.\n\nAlso there is nothing wrong with having a quiet life but if you're worried about not having anyone it would be fine to reach out and try to make one or two friends. You don't need to become a social butterfly.", "NTA\n\nMoving back in with your ex is **Always ** a dumb idea. And in this case he should leave medical treatment and monitoring to ... medical staff.\n\nFitbits don't record heartrate reliably and he would have to look at it 24/7 to see if it dropped.\n\n\nLooks like he wants to watch your every move.", "NTA. And. Be kinder to yourself. A quiet life doesn\u2019t mean a dull life. It actually means that you are comforted being alone and that is great. He divorced you. He doesn\u2019t get to ask anything from you to make him more comfortable. Those days are over.", "NAH \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re trying your best. I\u2019m also pretty sure/hopeful that he still loves you to a degree and doesn\u2019t want you to be one of those people that dies alone because they had no one to check on them. That probably scares the hell out of him, and his reactions are showing that.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wear the Fitbit.  You are wearing other medical appliances.    \nMeanwhile, you are divorced from Vince.  Yet, you have allowed him back in?  And now he has gotten possessive about you. Time to put a stop to that.", "Gonna go with NAH because it's understandable why he's worried about you, but he could have phrased it differently, so it's also understandable that you're upset. I would try to work out a compromise, such as \"I'll wear the fit bit when I'm home alone, but not when I'm at work or out in public places\" That should be reasonable, because if his concern is that you won't be around people, you will be when working or going to the grocery etc.", "NTA.  Your health is no longer any of his business since he chose to initiate a divorce.  It sounds like he wants somewhere to stay since his other plan didn't work out for him.  He also sounds pretty controlling, is that new or was he like that before?", "NAH\n\nHe is just worried about you. You should try to understand his point of view because it does makes sense. You DO have a serious condition that could result in death and the heart monitors have proved not completely trustworthy. Imagine how desperate he must be that something could happen to you and no one would know.\n \n \n I understand why it's hard for you to wear it, and your feelings are to be respected, but maybe try to find another solution rather then just not wearing it and doing nothing else to assure your safety.\n\nI imagine you might not feel confortable talking to him about how you feel, and you don't have to. Maybe come up with suggestions of things you are willing to do that would ease his mind.\n\n\nIt's fine to live a quiet, dull life if you're happy like this, but if you're not, it's okay to do things a little differently. You'll still be yourself", "NTA,also sounds like you\u2019re very hard on yourself. Everyone has a choice in how they lead their life. I think your choice in leading your life with a sense of calm is absolutely wonderful.", "NTA.  You are being handled by medical professionals and if you're comfortable with that then that is enough.\n\nFrankly, I imagine in the same situation I would would feel somewhat repulsed by the fitbit. You don't want me to wear a wedding ring, they why would I wear a fit bit?\n\nAlso, if he's living with you how awkward will it be when you find someone else you want to date?  You met and married your ex, so it is totally possible.  Maybe you can find someone who enjoys a similar lifestyle to yourself; he/she may be living quietly in your own town.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have to do what you feel comfortable with.", "NTA. He is acting like you're still married. You owe him nothing and he is acting really controlling. He literally has you wearing a tracker ffs! You already have two heart monitors that will call an ambulance. You don't need your ex husband tracking your every move.", "NTA. Your ex sounds genuinely concerned for you. So sorry you have to deal with such serious health issues.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nEven if you were still in a relationship, it's unnecessary for him to constantly monitor your heart beat. Crying and saying that you have to consider his feelings in your health condition is so incredibly manipulative, not to mention bringing up that you don't have anyone else close to guilt you into doing what he wants. If he was actually caring he would ask you \"do you want to wear a Fitbit so I can support you if it's needed?\" Not insist that you have to do it otherwise it'll hurt his feelings. \n\n1) I would boot his arse out your house.\n\n2) it's definitely not your fault you broke up. If the issue is that you're not wanting the same things from life, that's just an incompatibility and it's no one's fault.", "You are definitely not at fault for your divorce. I read your comments and the reason for your divorce sounds like he was being pressured by others which makes him a dink for listening. It sounds like he still really cares about you and if you feel the same, maybe therapy to work through the issues? You wouldn't be the first person to reconnect with an ex after a health scare. But that's entirely up to you! \n\nAs for the actual post. NTA. I also have heart issues and had some well meaning, but over bearing, friends who took it upon themselves to dictate how I dealt with it. Like one friend had a key to my place to walk my dog and let herself in when \"no one had heard from me\". I was sleeping after a night shift. I was pissed off because I woke up to someone in my room and it scared me. You decide who is privy to your health information and your personal space. It probably is a good idea to have someone involved in case you have another medical scare, but that's up to you who it is", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand from my mom, who grew up in canton, that small towns are hard to fit into after a while if they've already deemed you \"off\". There's nothing wrong with you that some time can't fix and truthfully no one has a solid answer on how much time.

You feel embarrassed and ashamed (and from your other comments, you seem to blame yourself for the divorce which you shouldn't). The fitbit is more for his peace of mind, but what about what your doctors say? Do they approve of an additional device on your body? Do they think it will help? \n\nIf you are uncomfortable with the Fitbit and it is medically not necessary for you to wear it, please don't wear it just to appease your ex-husband and now-roommate. Trust your doctors and their advice, it may be possible that the Fitbit hinders the function of your other devices. Your ex's feelings matter less than your own health and safety.

I strongly suspect that your ex husband is at least somewhat still in love with you, or is still attached to you emotionally.

He left you because he felt \u201cpressured by his friends\u201d - he placed them above his spouse and for a very immature reason. I don\u2019t know if he really had roommate issues, to me it sounds like he wanted to move in because he was scared and wanted to be able to check up on you. But the fact is, he cannot ask for a divorce and then also ask you to wear a device that sends bio data about you to his phone. It\u2019s a level of connection he is no longer entitled to.

Even if he still cares about you, he doesn't have to watch over you as though you're a child that needs looking after, if he's worried that he's going to loose you he should have thought about that before he broke things off.", "Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t see anyone asking:\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nDo you want to be roommates with your ex?\n\nDo you want him checking in on your health?\n\nBecause what\u2019s happening here is bigger than the Fitbit.

You speak of having a dull and lonely life, and I feel like that\u2019s your depression and perhaps other people putting you down speaking. Everyone\u2019s life is different and different doesn\u2019t mean wrong or negative. I\u2019m autistic and my life tends to be very different from other people\u2019s, but it\u2019s not any \u201cless\u201d than other people\u2019s. If you can, I would recommend you some therapy to deal with the changes in your life and your health issues. It\u2019s helped me to have that kind of support.\n\nOn your ex husband \u2014 I think he\u2019s overstepping boundaries and making everything about himself. Even the Fitbit thing, honestly I would also probably be uncomfortable with a current spouse having that means of control and scrutiny about my life. He\u2019s your ex husband and he\u2019s not in your life anymore really, the whole moving in together with you and all makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nSurely medical professionals or local welfare groups could advise you on how to deal with potential heart monitor failings better.

He's an absolute ass for leaving you for that dumb reason (which I suspect isn't even the real reason) then having the nerve to ask you to live with you again, then the whole Fitbit thing with him sobbing (which I don't get at all tbh, maybe he's faking being worried about you so you don't kick him out??

I encourage hubby to meet the guys in his own. When we have couple with dear friends, they all know I\u2019m going to leave before everyone is done hanging out and someone drives him home. It works for us but we also have supportive friends.

He can't exactly...this seems stalker to me.\n\nFind something you like. Church, a gym, the library. Make friends.\n\nYou can ask your doctor for life alert. That will notify police/paramedics.

Dont know why thats been so hard to do but I'm weird and awkward and it's taken 40 yrs but I like being weird and awkward and quiet and dull. So there is nothing  wrong with that at all. I will gladly take a day with nothing at all going on lol.  I am a no drama llama!\n\nAs for your ex, I think he may have realized he fucked up with the divorce and still has feelings for you. And he's trying to be subtle abt it. It's actually kinda sweet in an annoying not listening to your bodily autonomy kinda way. You do not need 3 devices. That's a bit much. Even if u liked bracelets that's a lot. \n\nMaybe sit down and have a conversation with him. He is absolutely traumatized from finding you. But he also needs to be reasonable.  But I suspect a deep conversation could go a long way here. \n\nNTA Op. I wish you all the luck with your health, and the most quiet contented life!", "NTA. So first off I want you to understand being an introvert is fine. Your divorce cannot be solely based on you . Relationships take two people. I\u2019d encourage joining something simple just for you like a book club. Most meet once a week and the book helps you have subject matter for talking. Just so you may have a friend and social interaction that\u2019s limited.\n\nSecondly you and your ex need to talk. Explain you wish he hadn\u2019t been the one to find you but what\u2019s going on with the two of you Is not healthy. Encourage him to seek therapy or support group. Tell him you want him to be happy but when you divorced you are no longer to be his concern. You appreciate it but it needs to stop. . He should also move out. Your divorce is still new and you need time and space for yourself. \n\nI think he\u2019s using you. Tbh. Bc you don\u2019t have someone else he\u2019s making you his fail safe. He wa ride about the divorce. You said his bf didn\u2019t like you and the plans he had with bf fell through . I think he was going To have a socially wild and fun time being single and nobody wanted him so he\u2019s trying to take advantage of you. He\u2019s also making a stressful situation worse. \n\nSeparate. Find a friend. Take care of yourself and enjoy your little bubble.", "NTA. I share your dull life and I fucking love it.

So I see the benefits of such things.  However, noneof us can use the watches to \"monitor\" the other.  \n\nI don't see the benefit of it calling your ex and having him move in to \"monitor\" you.  \n\nSo, kick him out, if you want to keep this watch, reprogram it to call someone else for help.  The someone else can be a neighbor, 911, whatever.", "Well, you say he's not controlling but he is definitely controlling. He left you because you didn't live your life the way he wanted you to. Now he's back but he's still making you live how he wants. He has made your condition all about himself. I don't think you should keep living with him. It sounds like he wants to live like you're married without actually being married. NTA", "NTA a fitbit most certainly IS a location tracker - you pay extra for that feature.

Your getting a divorce but he\u2019s taking care of you? I think you need boundaries and a clean split. The waters are muddy and it will lead to hurt feelings.", "NTA. I can't help wondering if maybe one reason he divorced you was because there was someone else. Maybe that's why he blamed you; he wanted to make you look like the bad guy. And maybe he came back because the other person didn't work out. But even if there was no one else, you shouldn't let him convince you that there's something wrong with you or your life. There isn't. And he is controlling because he's using your heart problem as an excuse to control you. Yet again he's telling you to live your life according to his terms. I get that he's concerned, but he is wrong to make you feel like an asshole yet again. He already hurt you and now he's making you feel worse.", "NAH. Just because you fall out of romantic love for someone doesn't mean you stop caring for them. Vince is freaking out about you possibly dying, which is pretty normal behavior when someone you really care about is suddenly very sick. \n\nAt the same time, you're not married any more, you are an adult, and you have the right to decide how you want to handle your health. This includes who you let help you in which ways.\n\nI suggest you figure out for yourself what you want from Vince, and where you will draw the lines. Then have an honest conversation with him where you both try to listen to each other. Address his concerns, don't ignore them in discussion, even if you don't change where your lines are drawn. Make sure he feels heard, but that he also knows you're in charge of your health.\n\nAlso, as a fellow introvert, previously from a small town, if you're happy with your life, that's all that matters. There's no right or wrong number of friends or quantity of social visits other than the number you're happiest with. \n\nLastly, I hope you get better soon. I hope you get a diagnosis soon, and that it's easily treatable. I have some weird health issues that caused circulation issues and a ton of other stuff (not as serious as this, though), and it took me years to get a diagnosis. Fingers crossed things move quickly and easily for you in the right direction.", "NTA, and although i can understand him being incredibly worried about you as the divorce didn't seem to end on some angry note like seen to do. \n\nBeing dull is fine, I'm pretty dang dull, i have very little friends and they are all online, and i don't go out to do much due to anxiety and other health issues.

He doesn\u2019t get to blame his friend for his poor choice. \n\nThe same things you say make you \u201cdull\u201d are the same things I find to make my life full. Coming home to a partner who is home and excited to see me is awesome. Not having to navigate a full social  calendar is perfect. Being someone who knows my neighbor also a plus.

You were not at fault in your divorce. \n\nAs for the Fitbit, you\u2019re correct. It is unnecessary if you\u2019re not asleep so that is overboard.

I had a partner that would question that all the time but my new partner doesn't mind. Some people are introverted, that doesn't mean your life is boring or empty! Your ex sounds very strange, he probably has his friends making judgements and listened to them and now might regret it...that's exactly what happened with my ex. \n\nI'd be very careful about the Fitbit though, it also tracks your locations and where you are at any given time. It sounds like the issue is when you sleep? Why would it matter during the day if you aren't napping?\n\nIt sounds like he has massive regrets and is trying to get back into your life.

Everyone is dumping on him but I understand why having no friends would take its toll on a relationship.\n\nHaving a partner/spouse who has no friends puts a LOT of pressure on you. You are their only social contact. That means emotions are shared with you and you only. They don\u2019t have any friends to vent to or discuss things with, so everything they wanna spit ball or talk about or consider or just theorise about? That\u2019s on you.\n\nEvery time they wanna go to the cinema or go for a walk or shopping or out to dinner? That\u2019s with you too. Every time they want to chat about a situation at work or something someone said or some random thing they watched or read - it\u2019s you. It\u2019s ALL you.\n\nI\u2019m married and yes, some of that is being in a committed close relationship with someone - and some of it is lovely! But it means most of their experiences are experiences you\u2019ve had too.\n\nThey don\u2019t ever go out with friends and try somewhere new and go, \u2018Hey spouse, I went to x today with Rachel and it was awesome! We should totally go!\u2019 They never come to you and say, \u2018Omg the funniest happened today with James, let me tell you all about it.\u2019 They never make social plans you get invited to or new stuff you can try with a new person. It\u2019s all on you and your friends to arrange those things if you want them.\n\nSo not a lot of new things happen that they can bring to the table - the majority of stuff they can talk about is stuff you\u2019ve done together, seen together and experienced together.\n\nWhen they do want social time or go try somewhere new, it\u2019s ALWAYS YOU that is expected to do it. If they want to go out for a walk and a chat, and you just don\u2019t feel like it that day? Your spouse then doesn\u2019t do it. There is no second option, it\u2019s you or nothing. And that fucking sucks for you, because the pressure is then on for you to fulfil that need for them, and it fucking sucks for your spouse because they just want to spend time with their spouse!\n\nI know all this because my husband has very few friends. And I absolutely adore him, I love him so so much, he is my best friend. It\u2019s absolutely not a divorce-worthy issue for me or even an issue I\u2019d ever mention to him. He is incredibly shy and it would break his heart for me to be like, \u2018You have no friends but me.\u2019 Because he tries so hard and is so kind and so sensitive, he just struggles to maintain social connections. I think it comes from having very low self-esteem and anxiety that he convinces himself people don\u2019t wanna hear from him. I would never ever do that to him.\n\nBut sometimes it\u2019s a lot. You feel like you bear the load of their emotional well-being because you are the ONLY person they can share things with. You are the only person they will do things with and you bear the weight of knowing that if you say no, they will lack what they need.\n\nYou are the organiser, the one who expends effort to keep relationships, the one who arranges people to see and things to do. It adds to your mental load.
