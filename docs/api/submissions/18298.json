I have never had many friends as I was shy and socially awkward. Vince was my total opposite in many ways and he fell out of love because I did not have close friends, I did the same thing every day, and I was very dull. I was hurt when he asked for divorce though it should have been expected but I realize it was my fault. \n\nA few weeks ago, I fell asleep at home. Vince came by to pick up some of his stuff and found me unresponsive. After a visit to the emergency room they found that my heartbeat would rapidly drop when I slept, something that could eventually lead to a sudden death. They are unsure of the cause but meanwhile I have to wear a heart monitor that tracked my heartbeat and calls the emergency line if it drops too low.\n\nVince asked to move in with me as he said there was an issue with the apartment he was sharing with his best friend. I agreed. He also asked if he could \u201cdo some things\u201d to reassure himself that he would not find me unresponsive again. I agreed but I feel it has gone too far.\n\nThere was a malfunction with my original heart monitor and now I wear two, one and one backup. He bought a Fitbit connected to his phone and asked me to wear it as it would inform him of when my heartbeat dropped. Vince said that it was necessary since I didn\u2019t have anyone but him to make sure I was alright. \n\nI feel embarrassed because it is true. My life has not changed. It is a quiet, dull life. The Fitbit was a painful reminder. I also am not used to wearing things on my wrists. I took it off at work and Vince called me in a panic asking why I took it off. I said it was unnecessary. He said the heart monitors weren\u2019t enough as I used phones, tablets, and microwaves. He said I didn\u2019t understand his feelings and worries and if I wanted to fix this I had to wear the Fitbit. He was sobbing on the phone and I could hardly understand him.

It's not your fault that you live a \"dull\" life, you know that, right?\n\nI'm really not sure what to make of your ex. \"Falling out of love\" with someone because they don't have a certain amount of friends is just...odd behaviour.\n\nRegardless, you do not have to wear a fit bit connected to his phone, even if it's a good reason. Which I'm not sure if this case is or not.\n\nIt seems like your ex has issues, to be brutally honest.", "I'm going to go with NAH here.\n\nYour ex-husband clearly still cares about you even though the marriage didn't work out and finding you unresponsive was likely traumatic for him. Him wanting you to wear the fitbit he can monitor is likely a response to that. It's not the healthiest and he should probably seek therapy to deal with it.\n\nAlso there is nothing wrong with having a quiet life but if you're worried about not having anyone it would be fine to reach out and try to make one or two friends. You don't need to become a social butterfly.", "NTA\n\nMoving back in with your ex is **Always ** a dumb idea. And in this case he should leave medical treatment and monitoring to ... medical staff.\n\nFitbits don't record heartrate reliably and he would have to look at it 24/7 to see if it dropped.\n\n\nLooks like he wants to watch your every move.", "NTA. And. Be kinder to yourself. A quiet life doesn\u2019t mean a dull life. It actually means that you are comforted being alone and that is great. He divorced you. He doesn\u2019t get to ask anything from you to make him more comfortable. Those days are over.", "NAH \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re trying your best. I\u2019m also pretty sure/hopeful that he still loves you to a degree and doesn\u2019t want you to be one of those people that dies alone because they had no one to check on them. That probably scares the hell out of him, and his reactions are showing that.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wear the Fitbit.  You are wearing other medical appliances.    \nMeanwhile, you are divorced from Vince.  Yet, you have allowed him back in?  And now he has gotten possessive about you. Time to put a stop to that.", "Gonna go with NAH because it's understandable why he's worried about you, but he could have phrased it differently, so it's also understandable that you're upset. I would try to work out a compromise, such as \"I'll wear the fit bit when I'm home alone, but not when I'm at work or out in public places\" That should be reasonable, because if his concern is that you won't be around people, you will be when working or going to the grocery etc.", "NTA.  Your health is no longer any of his business since he chose to initiate a divorce.  It sounds like he wants somewhere to stay since his other plan didn't work out for him.  He also sounds pretty controlling, is that new or was he like that before?", "NAH\n\nHe is just worried about you. You should try to understand his point of view because it does makes sense. You DO have a serious condition that could result in death and the heart monitors have proved not completely trustworthy. Imagine how desperate he must be that something could happen to you and no one would know.\n \n \n I understand why it's hard for you to wear it, and your feelings are to be respected, but maybe try to find another solution rather then just not wearing it and doing nothing else to assure your safety.\n\nI imagine you might not feel confortable talking to him about how you feel, and you don't have to. Maybe come up with suggestions of things you are willing to do that would ease his mind.\n\n\nIt's fine to live a quiet, dull life if you're happy like this, but if you're not, it's okay to do things a little differently. You'll still be yourself", "NTA,also sounds like you\u2019re very hard on yourself. Everyone has a choice in how they lead their life. I think your choice in leading your life with a sense of calm is absolutely wonderful.", "NTA.  You are being handled by medical professionals and if you're comfortable with that then that is enough.\n\nFrankly, I imagine in the same situation I would would feel somewhat repulsed by the fitbit. You don't want me to wear a wedding ring, they why would I wear a fit bit?\n\nAlso, if he's living with you how awkward will it be when you find someone else you want to date?  You met and married your ex, so it is totally possible.  Maybe you can find someone who enjoys a similar lifestyle to yourself; he/she may be living quietly in your own town.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have to do what you feel comfortable with.", "NTA. He is acting like you're still married. You owe him nothing and he is acting really controlling. He literally has you wearing a tracker ffs! You already have two heart monitors that will call an ambulance. You don't need your ex husband tracking your every move.", "NTA. Your ex sounds genuinely concerned for you. So sorry you have to deal with such serious health issues.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nEven if you were still in a relationship, it's unnecessary for him to constantly monitor your heart beat. Crying and saying that you have to consider his feelings in your health condition is so incredibly manipulative, not to mention bringing up that you don't have anyone else close to guilt you into doing what he wants. If he was actually caring he would ask you \"do you want to wear a Fitbit so I can support you if it's needed?\" Not insist that you have to do it otherwise it'll hurt his feelings. \n\n1) I would boot his arse out your house.\n\n2) it's definitely not your fault you broke up. If the issue is that you're not wanting the same things from life, that's just an incompatibility and it's no one's fault.", "You are definitely not at fault for your divorce. I read your comments and the reason for your divorce sounds like he was being pressured by others which makes him a dink for listening. It sounds like he still really cares about you and if you feel the same, maybe therapy to work through the issues? You wouldn't be the first person to reconnect with an ex after a health scare. But that's entirely up to you! \n\nAs for the actual post. NTA. I also have heart issues and had some well meaning, but over bearing, friends who took it upon themselves to dictate how I dealt with it. Like one friend had a key to my place to walk my dog and let herself in when \"no one had heard from me\". I was sleeping after a night shift. I was pissed off because I woke up to someone in my room and it scared me. You decide who is privy to your health information and your personal space. It probably is a good idea to have someone involved in case you have another medical scare, but that's up to you who it is", "Im not sure if you were the a******\n\nYou were in the wrong for just taking it off as you knew he was watching it. You knew it would stress him out, and of course he was crying he probably thought you were dying.\n\nBut it does seem a little bit much to have 2 heart monitors and a fitbit? But i am also not sure how reliable the monitors are. If they are very reliable but just broke once i dont see why you need a fitbit as well. But if its normal for them to break then i understand", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s holding on in one way, you another. Moving back in with him makes the divorce seem like a non-event and him crying on the phone because you don\u2019t want to wear a monitoring device reeks of being emotionally attached.", "He's trying to help you. So, unless you actually want to be found unresponsive again, YTA.", "In small towns, it seems that people without many friends are looked upon as strange at best and deeply flawed at worst. Vince said he felt pressured since his best friend did not like me and I had no friends so when he came home I was always there and excited to see him. I can see why it felt pressuring. My happiness does not solely rely on him but my socialization was really him, our neighbors, and my Ph.D. advisor.", "OP doesn't need more friends or even more excitement and less boredom. She needs her health condition managed. Until her diagnosis provides a pace maker or other intervention support, a mechanical device that supports her lowered heart rate isn't a bad idea.\n\n(Feeling cloistered and inactive would be hard on lots of partners. OP is not to blame for their differences. But, many, many people would not be comfortable never going anywhere but work and the grocery store and never doing anything besides sitting around or hanging out over coffee or TV.)", "As someone in a similar situation, alot of the pressure/frustration comes from always going out by yourself(especially if you\u2019d prefer your partner were there), then coming back to them just being.. there. Usually not doing anything noteworthy. There are absolutely challenges that come with someone who doesn\u2019t have any kind of social life. \n\nThis person apparently has no one else but their ex and maybe some neighbors. What makes you think he has issues just bc he\u2019s concerned about them having a medical emergency with no one to help them?", "I have no doubt that finding a dying person was traumatic. That is why I agreed to the measures at first. I also felt a bit guilty for causing the trauma. \n\nI have never been good at making friends. Such things are difficult for me.", "It might not be a Fitbit but it is a smart watch with EKG capabilities.\n\nI don\u2019t think he would want to. He\u2019s never been controlling.

There would be no need to watch my every move as I do the same thing", "I might try to work out a compromise though he\u2019s always been very stubborn.", "I\u2019m not sure why he chose my house to stay as he has plenty of options. It\u2019s not the best choice financially either.\n\nHe\u2019s never been controlling. He prefers a chaotic life while I like structure.", "It alerted him that I wasn\u2019t wearing it. I\u2019m not sure if it is a regular Fitbit but it\u2019s a smartwatch with EKG capabilities. \n\nThe heart monitors are very sensitive. The doctors advised that I do not use a laundry list of electronic devices, including electric toothbrushes, smartphones, smart tablets, microwaves, and more. I said that it would frankly be impossible for me to avoid them. The doctors said it is understandable but it may affect the performance of the monitors.", "Having such a device so close to the medical heart monitors will cause interference. Thank you for the suggestion though", "This is still really strange and it sounds like you\u2019re what, still living together as roommates and he\u2019s monitoring your health and getting really upset about it?\n\nDunno. That\u2018s an unusual situation.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re an introvert. So what? There are lots of us out there. If he \u201cfell out of love with you\u201d because of his friend\u2018s opinions and because of societal pressure to live up to some extroversion norm, well, Vince needs to grow a pair and decide what\u2019s important to HIM, not everyone else.\n\nTry to stop beating yourself up because you\u2019re \u201cdull.\u201d You\u2019re you and that\u2019s just fine. I\u2019m wondering if not wanting to wear the FitBit is in part depression or part \u201cwhat\u2019s the use if we\u2019re not married anymore anyway\u201d.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard to find, but I\u2019m thinking a screening for depression might be helpful for you?\n\nNTA.", "Honestly, it sounds like he still loves you and has regrets about leaving. I think it would be good to seek therapy to both work through his fears/trauma to finding you unresponsive and to see if there is still a relationship to save.\n\nNTA though, you already have 2 devices and don't need 3.", "Thank you for explaining what I was unable to articulate. It is understandable why Vince wanted a divorce", "Don't feel guilty about it. It's not your fault you had a medical emergency.\n\nHonesty, I would advise both of you to get (separate) therapy to help both of your situations.", "There can be a fair amount of control involved in a chaotic life. It often means that the only thing that matters is whatever he's currently fixated on.\n\nThat said, you need a health/safety plan that doesn't involve him. You're probably not going to establish healthy boundaries while he's in your space. You may be able to get guidance and support from the social worker at your doctor's office, as your situation is not unique. \n\nDon't die out of spite, but don't feel obligated to do what your ex wants.", "Ok, he is starting to move into controlling territory now though with tracking you all the time.  You are no longer married by his choice.  Time to thank him for his concern and tell to him avail of one of his other options as it is time for you both to move on.  Sorry about your medical issue by the way.", "\u201cHe prefers a chaotic life\u201d\n\nYou may just have figured out why he\u2019s back, your illness gives him a thrill that he\u2019s looking for. Send him somewhere else and take care of yourself. \n\nNTA", "This is very odd. I have a heart monitor connected to a phone, and they don\u2019t interfere with anything. If smartphones and tablets interfere with your monitors, doesn\u2019t the Fitbit also interfere?", "It is a roommate situation, I suppose. I inherited the house from my parents. It\u2019s small but I have a couple of guest bedrooms. Vince chose the one next to my room.\n\nThank you for the concern. I don\u2019t have symptoms of depression. My baseline is flat contentment. I am slightly worried about my health issues but such is life", "It sounds like he still loves her free housing and regrets leaving.", "But at the same time don't beat yourself up OP. I'm the same as you and my partner has expressed frustration before that he feels I lean on him too much for emotional and friendly support. It's something to work on for sure and it can be even harder to overcome in an area like yours. I understand from my mom, who grew up in canton, that small towns are hard to fit into after a while if they've already deemed you \"off\". There's nothing wrong with you that some time can't fix and truthfully no one has a solid answer on how much time. Life can be quaint without being boring or unusual in terms of connections it just matters what it means to you. Do you think you need to get out more and make new friends, have new experiences? If so, then start small but try! If not, then don't take into consideration what others think on how you operate in terms of happiness. It was not your fault you divorced. It was mutual, and you deserve to be happy despite what others think about you.", "They\u2019re physical devices taped to and under my skin. \n\nI think the Fitbit might interfere. You might have a point.\n\nEdit: the doctors did warn me that such electrical devices might interfere not that they would"]}
