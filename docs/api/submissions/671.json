I've had AAA since I was 16. My husband has tried multiple times to cancel it and I refuse. So worth spending $100 a year. I've also had an emergency kit in my car since I was 16.

That being said...you don't have a GF anymore.", "YTA. She was probably panicking and stressed and needed you support.

OK let see may you could... or I could call/search number for...\". Being in a relationship also means being there for the person emotionally and mentally, if you can't be there physically.", "YTA.

You can't even get there and back in that time, much less fix her car. And she knows what time you have to be at work. She's not acting 28.", "NTA, the gas / time for driving 2 hours round trip is likely more than it would cost her to get local help. Reasonable refusal from you and unreasonable reaction from her.", "YTA mainly because you think your GF owes you unconditional love. Parents owe you that. Your romantic partner's love is conditional. Why do you think people break up?", "INFO: what was stopping you from going to help?", "She is a grown woman, she was one hour away and you had to go to work, so NTA. BUT, you could have said that more nicely, dont you think?", "YTA, the reason you gave in your post (getting ready for work, work at 11), would have cleared you, you know, *had you actually said that* .\n\nInstead what you said was basically: \"dude, that's like one hour away: figure it out on your own\" . You could have given her the reason and googled a number for her to call or even called them yourself if they could send someone over. Instead, you did this in the most unsympathetic way possible that I cant even blame her for her reaction. You basically all but told her that she can't rely on you when she needs help.", "NTA.\n\nA dead battery in broad daylight isn't life or death. Plus you're 40 mins away.", "What the actual hell is going on here. You make little to no sense and offer zero reason you could provide NO help. First off on one line you say she was 40 minutes away, but on the very next it's an hour. Then your version of offering her help is to tell her to look stuff up on her own when you have no reason you couldn't look it up for her considering she's the one stranded here. Why would you even say that, why not just start searching options if you can't go, after all you had 2 full hours before your work started, it's not like you were currently rushing out of the door, you were ASLEEP. Also, the fact that she's \\~1hr away is irrelevant if we don't know what direction you work in (if you work in the same direction you would have to go to help her, you're loosing ground with your argument fast). Another thing I don't get (and maybe I just don't understand mechanics enough....) is how you describe her problem. You say her battery died because she left her lights on, heavily implying this is her own fault, but you edit to say that the car died on the road. Correct me if I'm wrong but.... I don't think that's how that works.\n\nIf you were truly \"actively trying to help\" by throwing out ideas including \"offering to pay for an uber,\" Here's an idea for you: it would have been soooooo much simpler to just create a AAA membership for her and have them come help if you're unable. It would probably be cheaper than an Uber anyhow. My guess is that she's not so much mad that you didn't come at her beck and call, but mad that you got all grumpy when she came to you.\n\nEdit to add that I find it in poor taste to add that you you needed to fill a flat as an excuse to not offer any help. You started this post by saying she woke you up with this issue. Unless you left your flat all night for the last second before work you didn't know that when she texted you, and it's therefore not a useable argument.", "YTA. Most people wouldn\u2019t hesitate to help and friend or loved one when they needed it. Unless there is a very good reason which you don\u2019t appear to have, it\u2019s a pretty decent thing to expect from someone. So yeah, I wouldn\u2019t call her again.", "YTA, I can't imagine my significant other messaging me for help and being like \"meh. I don't wanna drive 40 min to help you, figure it out\".  My fiance had come to my aid at like midnight before we even started dating to get me home in a blizzard.  She's realizing that to you she isn't even worth a 40 min drive.", "NTA.   You aren't the one who left the lights on and ran the battery down.   Given the distance it would have been impractical to go help.   Its was 9:00AM so (presumably) she wasn't in any danger and lots of mechanics would be open that she could ask for help.  All that said it sounds like your love life needs a jump start now.", "NTA - she needs to literally just get one friend that lives close to her\u2026 or ask someone in the lot\u2026 smh", "NTA\n\nIf you lived close by it'd be one thing, but an hour away? She's a big girl, she can call a tow company to come give her a jump. That's what I did a few years ago when my car died in a parking lot.", "NTA you were getting ready for work, she lives in another state, she was safe at home, it was the weekend and she had tons of time to solve the problem. Even cabs can come and boost you for a small fee.", "From the way you describe it: YTA.\nI get that there are better ways to fix a car, when you are an hour away. And I also get, that you cannot or want to drop everything and rush to her for this. But it just sounds like you simply don't care.", "NTA Illogical and impractical to call someone so far away instead of local help. But a lot cheaper. For her, of course. \n\nAnd what would she do with the kid in the car waiting for an hour for you to get there? And it's a weird story anyway. How did her car just stop in the middle of the road? It started normally at her home, but then stopped after driving for a while?", "NTA\n\nWhat would she do if she were single? That\u2019s what she should do: call a towing company or dealership or her insurance company if she pays for roadside. \n\nLast month, I (44F) pulled a dumb dumb and locked my keys and phone in my car at the grocery. My partner was an hour away up at our cabin. I called a tow company and resolved the whole thing. Didn\u2019t even tell my partner til he came home a few days later.\n\nShe fucked up and she needs to handle it. It would make no sense for you to drive all that way. \n\nNote: maybe get her one of the portable chargers. I got one for Vday and it\u2019s super handy. You can jump a car with it when a vehicle isn\u2019t in a position where you can easily jump with another vehicle and you can run your devices off of it in a power outage or while camping.", "Yta. If your partner calls you for help and you just completely blow them off that\u2019s not a great response", "NTA. \n\nShe should look into some Roadside assistance! Lol", "YTA\n\n40 minutes is nothing, I drive farther to work each day. You should have driven to help her (especially considering it sounds like you were off), if you legitimately couldn't drive there, at the very least you should have helped do the \"legwork\" on the phone to get her the assistance she needs.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to help someone and make them feel like you are helping, without being physically present.", "It's reasonable to not want to go that far when you have work and there are other options. NTA for that but depending on how you said it to her yeah coulda been. She sounds like a child though and not 28. I might be disappointed but don't talk to me again? really? But again could be how you said it and getting that response.", "YTA\n\n\n\nYOU could have offered to organise her help. \n\n\n\nIn a relationship the problems of the other person should feel personal. You should care. \"Nope, look for other help\" ...

It\u2019s silly if you to drive all that way, be late for work, for a simple issue that can be solved by doing a bunch of adult things. I\u2019m curious how her lights being on while she dropping the kids off causes her battery to die though. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. She needs a new battery likely and that\u2019s not likely something you have laying around. Or know how to install.

Congrats.\n\nYou showed her she cannot rely on you, and that you don\u2019t value her or spending time for her.  Nicely done.  Enjoy being single.", "YTA.  You did not give any reason other than the fact that she was not close to go help. Did you offer up other solutions to her? AAA maybe?", "YTA. Being able to count on people is part of being in a relationship. She needed help and it doesn't seem like you had any reason not to go, other than it being a bit of a drive for you. I hope she had roadside assistance or a friendly neighbor since you were unwilling to help.", "dude\n\nYTA\n\nIf you really loved her, you would want to help her instead of leaving her there to fend for herself. She trusted you enough to help her and you essentially said FU", "OP said in a comment that she was on the NY bound side of the GWB when her co-worker was driving on the NJ bound side of the GWB. How did her car battery die due to the lights being left on if her car was on the George Washington Bridge?\n\nAlso, I lived in Washington Heights for 10 years and often would commute to Fort Lee for my job. Being stalled on the NY bound side of the bridge at 9 am would be a complete and utter nightmare and scary as heck.

YTA.", "YTA - less because you didn't help but because from what you've written, you didn't offer any empathy or support at all. She was probably panicked, flustered, and reached out to you for help.

But maybe you left that out, idk \n\nEveryone's love is conditional on feeling supported by and important to their partner, and she didn't feel that from you.", "NTA  I (f) wouldn't have bothered my BF with this nonsense because I'm a competent human who can call a tow company or ask a friend who lives closer.

Dude, I waited 2 hours in line to buy a special edition DS for my girlfriend at midnight when I had work the next day.

I mean, she could have called a towtruck for a jump in less than half the time it would take to put your pants on, gas up, and drive to where she was.  Instead she was willing to sit there on the side of the road--presumably with at least one very young child in the car--and wait all that time. Pretty silly.

Unconditional love is what keeps people with abusers. Not saying you're abusive, but that was a weird comment to make imo.

I can see not wanting to bother the parents that are paying you to get the child to school.
