My family cannot afford the flights themselves, which I'm already aware of. The cost of the flights are not an insignificant cost to me but I'm very happy to do that as I want my family to be there at my wedding.\n\nI had contacted my sister about the dates a year in advance as I knew my sister had to do a bit more planning because of my niece. I was assured that it would be no problem for them.\n\nSo I lock in dates for 3 weeks during the month of my wedding. When time came to book the tickets, my sister is unsure of the dates now. I tell her to take a week to talk to my nieces school and decide what dates work for her as it is cheaper to book everyone together instead of seperate flights. Come end of the week, out of nowhere I get blasted by her saying she feels pressured to lock in the dates and she doesn't care about the planning the wedding. She tells me to go ahead and book for my parents & brother. She said she'll handle her flight tickets herself.\n\nSo I go ahead and book the flights for my parents & brother.\n\n2 weeks go by, I get an apology message from my sister. She said she was \"just not in a good mood\" that day. She asks if I had already booked the tickets. I confirmed I did since she told me to go ahead. She now tells me she can come a week after my parents as that \"works for her\". I tell her I need to think about the costs and get back to her. I take some time to think, I do want my sister at my wedding so I decide to book her flights at the end of the next month when I get paid. I told her of this and locked in the dates.\n\nNext month arrives, my sister calls me suddenly and tells me she \"can now come on the same dates as my parents\". I am very annoyed, I ask why her dates changed again. She says she had to get somethings sorted and clear her mind, didn't even go into details. I decide I don't want to argue, I said fine I'll book at the end of the month as my said before when i get paid and I told her that had she already agreed to the original dates it would have cost me less. She now has an issue with the \"tone of my voice\" and starts going on and on about her problems and she insists that I don't want her at my wedding. Like what?!? I end the call as I can't deal with her endless ranting.\n\nAfter talking with my fianc\u00e8 I have decided I am not going to finance my sisters flight anymore as she is so indecisive. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. She keeps changing up the dates for the flights which I'm sponsoring with my money and all other expenses for her stay during MY wedding.\n\nIt's just too much for me right now and I'm tired of having my generousity taken advantage of. My mom thinks I'm being too harsh.

Sister Dearest had 12 months notice of the wedding and the journey - and it's not your fault if she has done absolutely nothing about securing the dates from her work or her school for her daughter.You accommodated her indecision - and gave her plenty of notice that you'd be paying for the new tickets at the end of the month when you got paid - and she waited until AFTER that deadline to change her mind again.  You were well within your rights to voice that if she'd gotten her shit together and made a concrete decision about the original dates and stuck to it, it would have cost you less.  So then she rails up at you saying \" wahh wahhh  I don't like your tone \" .. as though all of these arrangements are at her personal expense, and you were the one putting HER out.  Yeah, NOPE.. Unacceptable Sissy..\n\nTo me, that smacks of attention seeking, and it even crosses my mind that her indecision floats around the possibility that she's accepting other offers of entertainment (i.e. got a better offer - go pound sand) around that time in her own social circle, and only coming back to you if those offers don't solidify.\n\nYou're well within your rights to choose or not to choose to pay for her trip -  especially after her comment \"Come end of the week, out of nowhere I get blasted by her saying she feels pressured to lock in the dates and she doesn't care about the planning the wedding.\"  She doesn't give a rats ass about the most important day of your life.. Nor should you care if she isn't there to spread her entitled bullshit over your day.\n\nDefinitely not the asshole.", "NTA. The fact that you were willing to fly her and the daughter out to you guys is very generous and her waffling back and forth between dates because \"she couldn't clear her mind\" is ridiculous. You snooze you lose.", "NTA don\u2019t pay for the tickets. She sounds like she just wants to cause drama and get free tickets out of the deal. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she cancelled last minute and used the tickets for something else.", "NTA. I dont think your an asshole. It seems like your sister is indecisive and a drama queen. I get why you feel how you do and you are within your right not to pay youve been messed about. \n\nBut Im not sure id have withdrawn the flights offer. I get your feelings in this moment. But as annoying as it is i think a date was finally settled on i probably would have just got on and booked it, then its done.  It sounds like you do want her there but i get her behaviour is annoying. I think in future you might regret withdrawing the offer.", "NTA\nI had the best destination wedding. My brother and sister did not come. It did not take from my wedding. \n\nYou offered, she\u2019s went back and forth and lost out on free Airfare. I had 60 people at my destination wedding and I didn\u2019t pay for anyway", "NTA. Rescind the offer. She\u2019ll likely be a no show. She is trying to make this all about her, so just remove her from the equation.

It sounds like she\u2019s really stressed. Is she a single mom? Did you try listening when she brought up her problems? Maybe she\u2019s struggling with some jealousy that your life is coming together and you\u2019re well-off and living abroad? Your frustration is totally valid, but I would probably try to reach out one more time just because if she can\u2019t afford to come, the fallout could be very hard to overcome considering your distance. I would start the conversation by saying things have been tense lately and you just want to see what\u2019s going on that\u2019s making her so stressed.

You state that \u201cshe went on and on about her problems.\u201d  Did you listen and try to empathize with her?  Or was your pre-wedding brain unable to take this all in?  Completely understandable if that is the case.\n\nYou are both stressed out for completely different reasons.  I agree with your mother that you are being too harsh.  Take a deep breath and try to be emotionally available to your sister.  I think you will really regret not having her at your wedding because you are understandably annoyed.  Just keep an eye on the big picture because this is just one day.  Your siblings are the people that you will have the longest relationship with over the course of a lifetime.", "She doesn't want to come. She was making it difficult in hopes to piss you off.

It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re a busy mom to find time to dedicate 3 whole weeks of your life to a single event, even if it\u2019s an event that\u2019s important to you.  \n\nIt\u2019s an AH move to rescind your offer to buy her ticket, just because your sister isn\u2019t making her life revolve around your plans.
