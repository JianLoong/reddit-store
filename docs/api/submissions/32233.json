PLEASE do not tell them it is because you want your social life and hate being at home. If you are able to come and stay with her for a few days, it would go a long way to helping them and keeping the family happy and maybe they can make other arrangement for a few days before you get there.

Any time you accept financial assistance it comes with strings attached. If that is not the case, absolutely not. Your sister is 13 which, in most states/countries, is old enough to stay home unsupervised. Why doesn\u2019t your sister stay with a friend for a few nights and they can keep their trip brief? They\u2019ve had time to make other accommodations, other family members, friends. It doesn\u2019t fall on you to do this. Better yet, why don\u2019t they bring her with them? They would rather majorly inconvenience you and waste your gas money/time than she\u2019ll out a little more for a plane ticket for your sister?

If you were to reschedule all of it, it would affect your limited time when classes resume and you have a hundred other demands on your time. I expect your parents will not be happy at your unavailability.\n\nIn a best-case scenario neither your nor your sister's school should be affected, but apparently it will need to be one or the other. She is 13. I would think that your parents could ask for the homework ahead of time, take her with them, and help her with any homework questions she might have. Is that a possibility?\n\nAlternatively, if they won't be gone for too long, can your sister stay with a local friend while your parents are away?\n\nI am surprised that your parents are considering going to the wedding. I don't doubt that they want to go, but even two tickets with such short notice would cost a lot of money. \n\nGood luck.", "INFO:  are your parents still paying your way?", "NTA your parents obviously dont understand that your obligations towards your academics career plans are important.

You miss a few events, she is inconvenienced and her friends aren\u2019t overburdened. Or have your parents simply take her with them.  your sister will get an excused absence\u2026. It is just one week! What school would complain about an 13 year old missing a week to visit international family. It happens all the time.", "NTA.  If you volunteered to watch sister, that  would be OK.  But your parents have no right to demand your time to watch your sister.  You've got so much important stuff going on around the same time that (logically speaking) it would be stupid to travel home anywhere near the 12th.  \n\nAs always, you can't care for someone else unless you care for yourself, first.  That means you settle all your commitments at school and (applying for intern positions), stuff like that FIRST.  Then if you have leftover time, you might consider helping out your parents with your sister.\n\nBut If you do what you need to do to take care of yourself, your parents will obviously  need to make other arrangements to have someone else watch over your sister.\n\nOn a side note, my daughter is 13.  I would never want her to be alone for a couple of weeks.  But she is mature enough now that she could handle it, if she needed to.  I  know her.  If left on her own, She would go to school, do homework, play minecraft, and make herself waffles 3 times a day on the weekends.  (!!!!)  Maybe a compromise would work.  That is, your parents leave her with grocery money and tell her to call your cell phone if anything unexpected happens.  Then you also call her twice a day, just to check on her.  Most 13-year-olds should be able to keep themselves alive for a couple of weeks with little trouble.  And let's face it.  When you are babysitting, your primary mission is to keep the kiddos alive.  So the average 13 year old girl should be able to stay alive for a couple of weeks without much help from older brother...", "NTA.

No is a complete sentence so you don\u2019t need to justify yourself but if you feel like you have to tell them your schedule is completely full of things that can\u2019t be moved or canceled until the 18th. You were under the impression they weren\u2019t even considering going so you didn\u2019t leave any space in your schedule.", "NTA, while I understand that a wedding is a big family event and that it would be great to be able to go, your future needs to take priority here and you need to stress that to your mother and if she doesn't understand then she'll have to lump it unfortunately. Your future matters more than a wedding and so get it on the googly my mukka and push onwards.", "NTA - Hey mum my exam was pushed to the 19th now, the Uni is just being stupid right now.
