It\u2019s difficult to have a disabled child, but it\u2019s ultimately your mother\u2019s responsibility to care for her children. Many families sadly become about the disabled child, and while not fair I can see why this happens so frequently. Because\u2026it\u2019s just hard. There are resources available to her for these exact purposes. I\u2019m certain some states are better (or worse) than others, but she should look into what may be available to assist with caretaking. \n\nYou are an adult, your life if yours. You are living your own life on your own terms and still available to them, albeit in a less 24/7 way. You were not born to care for your sibling.", "NTA. I can sympathize with your mom's situation. I'm a single mom and my youngest has Down Syndrome. So when I say what I'm about to, it's coming from a place of knowing exactly what it's like.\n\nYou need to live your life. Chase your dreams and do what makes you happy. You're her daughter, not a caregiver. You do not exist to be your mother's backup plan. \n\nYour mom needs to come up with care plans that don't rely on you. It's her responsibility to her daughter.", "Nta. It's a bad situation for sure, but realistically you cannot be expected to put your life on hold to take care of your sister. It may sound a bit harsh but it's the parents responsibility to make arrangements regarding their child's wellbeing. Not the siblings.", "NTA - It probably is something difficult for your mum to deal with, but it\u2019s also not your responsibility to look after your sister. As your sister is already an adult, your mother should be making provision for what happens when she passes anyway, rather than assuming that you are going to take on that responsibility - what are you meant to do financially, if you are a full time carer?\n\nIf this is too much for one person, there is in-home help available to your mum and that\u2019s the avenue she needs to be looking at, rather than again making this assumption of you. Children (even adult children) are not free carers and should not be treated as such.\n\nYou should not be feeling guilty for having a life of your own, no matter how much you clearly care about and love your mum and your sister.", "NTA, your life is your life and you are free to live it however you want to, where ever you want to, your mom is stressed about the upcoming change but she will adjust to it", "NTA\n\nIt's hard with siblings that need extra care, because we feel guilty. But at the end of the day - your sister is not your child and therefore you are not responsible for helping care for her. Sounds like you've offered respite and to assist but OP - please go live your life. \n\nYou are not responsible for your sisters care.", "NTA\nI can understand that your mom panicked a little when she heard about your plans, as it does have an impact on her as well.\n\nThat being said however, this is your life and your mom cannot expect you to put it on hold to take care of your sister. That isn't your responsibility, truth be told.\n\nNot sure how this works where you live, but over here there are day centers and such for people with a disability that need round the clock care.", "NTA- Similar thing happened to me.  I not only moved out of state, I moved out of the country.  Best decision of my life.  You live your own life, not your sister's, not your mother's.  I hate It that that put this weight on us siblings who do not decide nor participate in bringing a child into the world.  This Is not on you.", "NTA. Go live your life. Your mom is manipulating you. She needs to find resources to help. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation but it\u2019s not your responsibility. She has no right to demand this if you. It\u2019s cruelty on her part. \n\nConsider therapy to deal with your feelings of guilt.", "NTA, I mean do what makes you feel best but if you\u2019re wondering if your sister is your responsibility then the good news is she simply isn\u2019t your child.", "NTA You have to be able to live your life. It can't be easy having a disabled child, but that does not mean that you can force your other children into being caretakers. \n\nI'm not American so I don't know what services are available for parents of disabled children, but surely they must get help of some kind? Plus, your mother needs to make plans for what will happen to your sister after she can no longer care for her. She needs to research facilities or group homes, some place where your sister will be safe and live a happy life.", "NTA, it may suck for your mom, but you did not sign up to be a caregiver. You should live your own life.", "Run up her water bill and eat her food?? That is such an ungrateful response.  NTA", "NTA.\n\nThis definitely isn't easy but your sister is not your obligation. You have every right to do what you think is best in your life and you are entitled to have fun and travel around. I know this sounds harsh but every time I read posts like these I can only think of their mentality being \"If I have to be stuck being a caregiver so does everyone else.\" Not to mention, you offered to fly in whenever it was needed, that's already as much as you can do while having your own life.", "NTA.. you need to live for you. Your sister\u2019s care should never fully be your responsibility. If you want to help, great, but it should never be expected. Your mom needs to get some plans in place. There are resources to help her!", "NTA. Before you go check into what assistance the state may be able to provide. If your sister receives benefits, there may be help available.", "NAH\n\nCaring for a disabled family member is a huge burden, and I don't blame anyone for not compromising their life for it. Everyone knows how much they can contribute to that care relative to the other requirements in their life, and it sounds like you know exactly where that line is for you.\n\nWhat is she going to do when your mom can no longer care for her? Your mom can't expect to offload her to you at that time if you have other life goals.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is normal to feel guilty at times but go. Return if and when you want to. You mom's complaining may be easier to manage when you establish separate independence. You can only control you; not her opinions and actions.\n\nEncourage your mom to explore social services support and programs your sister can attend so her life is enriched and your mom's load is lighter.  Best to you!", "NTA \n\nResponsibility for your sister belongs only to the people who chose to create her, which isn't you. I'd tell your mom that you sympathize with her situation, but it's a situation that you had no say in and isn't your responsibility. You're an adult and it's your turn to make your own choices and live your own life. Encourage her to pursue services through the state and financial support from sister's father to get help, but you will be living your own life from now on and any good mother would want that for you.", "NTA, and I say this as a mother to several children. None of whom are special needs, but if one of them ended up with a medical need, I wouldn't expect my other kids to stop living their lives. She should wish you the best.", "NTA. It's your life and it's happening now. You can't out it on pause.", "NTA.  You're allowed to live your own life as you see fit.  Your mother has always planned on dumping your sister's care onto you the minute she sees herself unable to care for her, she should have set up some form of care the minute she found out your sister had down syndrome.", "NTA. /. First of all if your sister requires this much care your mom should have looked into care programs for her long ago.  There are facilities she can explore.  I\u2019m sure mom thought when she could no longer care for sis you would take over that job.  Not your responsibility.  It is your mom\u2019s responsibility to find the best situation for your sister so that she can be eased into it while your mom can spend time with her.  I bowl with a DS man whose parents placed him in a care facility.  He is basically non verbal but can do a slight job and bowls.\nFor some DS people, their families turn into their worst nightmares.  Don\u2019t know if your sis was beyond the point of learning self care or if she was held back. I don\u2019t know how old your mom is but it\u2019s negligent of her not to explore avenues to secure your sister\u2019s future.", "NTA.  I think mom has in the back of her mind that you will take over for her as she ages or after death.  But if you move away this seems much less likely. Also I am guessing mom may not have time for friends as she is caring for sis which means she doesn\u2019t have much backup beyond you. \n\nMove, but make time to FaceTime mom and sister very regularly so that they are still part of your life.  I think mom will come around but give her time to get used to everything.", "Thank you so much. This really does make me feel more content, especially knowing you understand the situation.", "Those usually cost money and some people went wealthy", "Oh, zero doubt that's exactly what the mom \\*does\\* expect. My sister has multiple conditions that make it impossible for her to live independently, and I've been told since I was nine that someday I would have to \"take care\" of my sister (she lives in a group home, but we are all still close and involved; my parents are a bit overly so, rather interfering IMO).  \n\n\nNTA, OP. Go, live your best life. Send your sibling postcards, I bet she'll love that!"]}
