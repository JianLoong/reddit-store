Even homeless have better hygiene. Don't like the passive aggressive tone though. Just say it outright: \"Don't touch your genitals and then touch stuff in the house without cleaning your hands. I don't want to touch your privates, second-hand or not\"", "NtA, fucking gross. I hope you don't share food with this person.", "NTA.  You did not do anything wrong.  The person not washing their hands could have all sorts of things on their hands - Covid, for example.  Research indicates that people who wash their hands after using the bathroom get sick less than people who don't.  My own experience has been that once I started to wash my hands, I almost never got sick.  In particular, I haven't had a cold in decades.  So stick to your guns.", "NTA that is unhygienic and gross. It\u2019s something people learn in kindergarten. There was a similar post recently citing the health risks.", "NTA No normal person are fine with having another persons piss and poop hands touching things in their home.", "YTA, not because you have an issue with this, but because of the way you went about it.\n\nBringing it up in a group chat made it very easy for the person to feel targeted/humiliated in front of someone else, meaning it made more sense for both of them to deny it. I don\u2019t think it would have been a big deal if you had just pulled them aside individually and said, \u201chey, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s you or not, and you don\u2019t have to tell me anything, but one of y\u2019all isn\u2019t washing your hands and it makes me deeply uncomfortable because of hygiene issues, so if it\u2019s you, I\u2019m asking you to please wash your hands\u2014and if it\u2019s not you, cool, just something to keep in mind.\u201d", "YTA. They're gross, but you went about this in such a weird and passive aggressive way. You should have either approached them directly or said nothing", "Hell no. That is disgusting behavior that should be called out.", "YTA. Why not mention it to both of them discreetly rather than trying to shame them in front of their other other flatmate?", "NTA. That's disgusting. I had a roommate that would wake up in the morning and just start emptying the dishwasher. Nice to do that chore, but fucking wash your hands first after touching things all night. Also she would run her hands under water for 2 seconds after the bathroom, taking out garbage, etc. And she thought she was a clean freak. Gross.", "YTA. This just makes it sound like you listen in on people when they go to the bathroom.", "By making it about you hearing them, it sounds like you\u2019re actually trying to hear what people do in the bathroom. They might now be highly self conscious of any sound they make while in there. And that\u2019s pretty messed up. I don\u2019t understand why you would tell them you know someone doesn\u2019t wash their hands. Did you want to shame them into washing them? I think it is a weird thing to just post in a group chat. Slight YTA", "YTA you are using the same items that a person that doesn't wash their hand is using. You just don't actually know who it is but you definitely are. And I'm not talking about your roommates either. You care so much about hygiene that your maximum effort to finding who it is and/or remedy the situation is a passive agressive message on a group chat, so you don't really care that much you just wanted to be TA.", "NTA,  not washing hands is nasty and exposes you to germs", "I lived with a flatmate and our downstairs toilet never had TP in it, and she always used that toilet... I stayed quiet because: what she does in the restroom is her business. Maybe your roommate uses hand sanitizer? Either way or, it's not your business, and to actively show you are listening- that's what makes YTA", "NTA. That's nasty af. I would've called a real meeting on that one.", "I used to have a friend visit me for a week every year. I was sure she wasn't washing her hands after using the bathroom. It wasn't until we moved and we had a fully stocked guest bathroom for to realize that the new hand soap hadn't been used, hand towels hadn't been touched and barely any toilet paper had been used \ud83e\udd2e its tough finding out those close to you are absolutely disgusting. It is absolutely gross to share space with someone that doesn't wash their hands, you could all get sick. NTA", "YTA, you\u2019re their roommate, not their mom. Their personal hygiene or lack thereof is their own problem and it\u2019s not your job to shame them.", "NTA. \n\nThat's just gross behavior and it should be called out. There's nothing wrong with having conversations about hygiene with people that share living space with you.", "That's nasty. That's how sickness and germs are spread.", "NTA\n\nWash your damn hands with SOAP. Also I would not use the same items in the kitchen after that comment cause gods know if they even wash their hands before using any sort of food items. Yuck.", "NAH - Some one has below average hygiene habits, and you called them out. Sounds like an adult conversation to me. I bet both of you could have been more polite about it.", "YTA\n\nPure obnoxious pettiness here.  The fact you didn't even know who it was and didn't bother trying to figure it out shows that you know it doesn't affect you.  You are not the hand washing police, mind your own business.", "From my experience I (M) can pee and wipe without any contact with my skin. I mean my hands doesn't touch skin, only paper.", "YTA you don't need to wash your hands if you got a clean dick", "YTA for the way you worded that.

It\u2019s a safe bet, they\u2019ve got to be doing it somewhere and why not their own bathroom.

Especially when you're living with someone and touching shared items.", "Way to miss the point, let your roommates go to the bathroom in peace and don\u2019t shame them in a group chat.
