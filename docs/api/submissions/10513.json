We got married right after Covid and share 2 beautiful children. About about year into our dating, Matt\u2019s dad (Chris, 68M) found out from an acquaintance that I take medication for social anxiety. This was something I hadn\u2019t told Matt about yet but was planning to soon, as recommended by my therapist. Chris was  furious and demanded that Matt put our dating on hold so Chris can determine if I was \u2018mentally stable.\u2019 Matt\u2019s sister is a pharmacist & Chris got her involved to research what medication I\u2019m on, how it impacts me, etc. At this point I really loved Matt & didn\u2019t dump him while I was enduring this bs. Chris\u2019s obsession with my taking medication got more intense and he demanded to speak to my therapist. Then he wanted his daughter to speak with him. Then he wanted the family priest to speak with him (Matt & I are not as religious as his family). After months of this abuse, I agreed to allow the priest to speak with my therapist. They had a short conversation and the priest told Chris that he shouldn\u2019t be concerned about me. This still wasn\u2019t enough and Chris started calling one of my close friends multiple times over the next couple of months, asking her if she thinks I\u2019m stable, etc. Matt & I were still dating although I felt a lot of resentment. Eventually he proposed and I said yes. Now we are married with kids and I have a very loving marriage & no regrets I married him. The one issue that I have is he still looks up to & respects Chris, even after knowing all he\u2019s done to me. I hate Chris so much that it hurts. What makes the hatred more intense and doesn\u2019t allow me to heal is that Matt views Chris as a saint & keeps a close relationship with him. They talk on the phone daily & Matt is constantly telling me that Chris is a great guy and I need to forgive & forget. I can\u2019t because I feel like Chris is trying to still sabotage me by telling Matt things behind my back like I\u2019m crazy, too tough, not a good fit for the family, etc. There\u2019s so much more but due to the word limit I can\u2019t include. I\u2019m constantly making snide remarks about Chris whenever Matt mentions him. Sometimes I\u2019ll call him a POS or a-hole. Matt gets angry, defensive, sad, and then starts insulting my dad.

She said some fairly insensitive things, but my husband\u2019s response was to listen, comfort me, and then go talk to his mother about why what she said was wrong and not acceptable.  If someone chooses the side of someone who attacks you and hurts you, they aren\u2019t a good partner.  You can deal with problematic in-laws with a spouse who takes your side, but there is no dealing with a spouse who doesn\u2019t choose you.", "NTA, so I\u2019m in the mental health field and an anxiety sufferer myself. I give you kudos honey because no way would the priest be talking to my therapist \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. This man is clearly so ignorant about mental health I have to laugh at this point. Unfortunately, our society still has a huge stigma when it comes to mental health especially the older generations since it used to be shameful to have a family member with any type of mental illness. Does he realize that millions of people in America have anxiety?? That anxiety is a normal response that we all experience from one time to another.

It is what it is, and you constantly making hurtful, yet truthful remarks is only making things worse.

I don't have the words", "ESH\n\nThe irony here is it sounds like your father in law is the one with the mental health issues given how obsessive he is over this and the reality is your medical health is NONE of his business and between you, your doctor, possibly Matt and NOONE else\n\nHowever given that your husband hasn\u2019t properly stood up for you and seem to think his father has done no wrong you demanding he cut contact\u2026..I guarantee this won\u2019t end well for you, Especially if you\u2019re constantly throwing in digs and starting arguments over this\n\nYou need to have a serious chat to your husband about this now and find an agreeance or strategies around this or your marriage is not going to survive", "NTA, but definitely go for couples counseling.", "Mostly NTA, but the snide remarks do not help your marriage.

I\u2019m so sorry. you were definitely abused by his dad and I\u2019m sad for you that your husband didn\u2019t stick up for you and put his dad in his place. You deserved more from all parties involved. I think it\u2019s a normal response to keep venting those things under these circumstances, but I would try your best to forgive. Not forgiving is only hurting you in the long run as the pain inside is torturous and Chris I\u2019m sure feels nothing and goes unbothered. Keep talking with your counselor and I hope you are able to heal. If you haven\u2019t already, make some sort of boundaries with Chris.

WHY DID YOU MARRY HIM????", "Did Matt stick up for you at all during the crap his father pulled? His father crossed so many boundaries that it boggles my mind.

But I still feel they ESH, because you have children with this man who now are being raised by someone who thinks so little of their mother, that he\u2019s willing to accept his father abusing you. \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t sound like either of their parents have a good grasp on how people deserve to be treated or how to set healthy boundaries, and it leaves them vulnerable to ending up in similarly dysfunctional relationships. Constantly making comments about their grandfather doesn\u2019t help this.\n\n*Editing to add: from your replies, it sounds like you have been brought up in a small, religious community, which makes me wonder if your \u201ctherapist\u201d was someone from that church as well. I know people who have belonged to churches that are invasive & controlling like this sounds. It took one of them being sexually assaulted as a teenager and then counseled that it was *her* fault, and the other having the leadership telling her that her husband drugging & raping her wasn\u2019t rape for them to finally leave. If you are in a situation like this, for the sake of your children - if not yourself - I hope you are able to recognize that this is not normal and leave the toxicity of your environment ASAP. *", "ESH you lied to your significant other and hid a major thing from him.

Giving this ultimatum will end your marriage. Stop speaking badly about your husband\u2019s dad because It obviously hurts your husband. Could you imagine someone constantly talking trash about someone you love dearly?\nI am sure if FIL is still talking about you poorly, you talking trash about him to your husband doesn\u2019t make you look any better in this.
