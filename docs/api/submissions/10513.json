We got married right after Covid and share 2 beautiful children. About about year into our dating, Matt\u2019s dad (Chris, 68M) found out from an acquaintance that I take medication for social anxiety. This was something I hadn\u2019t told Matt about yet but was planning to soon, as recommended by my therapist. Chris was  furious and demanded that Matt put our dating on hold so Chris can determine if I was \u2018mentally stable.\u2019 Matt\u2019s sister is a pharmacist & Chris got her involved to research what medication I\u2019m on, how it impacts me, etc. At this point I really loved Matt & didn\u2019t dump him while I was enduring this bs. Chris\u2019s obsession with my taking medication got more intense and he demanded to speak to my therapist. Then he wanted his daughter to speak with him. Then he wanted the family priest to speak with him (Matt & I are not as religious as his family). After months of this abuse, I agreed to allow the priest to speak with my therapist. They had a short conversation and the priest told Chris that he shouldn\u2019t be concerned about me. This still wasn\u2019t enough and Chris started calling one of my close friends multiple times over the next couple of months, asking her if she thinks I\u2019m stable, etc. Matt & I were still dating although I felt a lot of resentment. Eventually he proposed and I said yes. Now we are married with kids and I have a very loving marriage & no regrets I married him. The one issue that I have is he still looks up to & respects Chris, even after knowing all he\u2019s done to me. I hate Chris so much that it hurts. What makes the hatred more intense and doesn\u2019t allow me to heal is that Matt views Chris as a saint & keeps a close relationship with him. They talk on the phone daily & Matt is constantly telling me that Chris is a great guy and I need to forgive & forget. I can\u2019t because I feel like Chris is trying to still sabotage me by telling Matt things behind my back like I\u2019m crazy, too tough, not a good fit for the family, etc. There\u2019s so much more but due to the word limit I can\u2019t include. I\u2019m constantly making snide remarks about Chris whenever Matt mentions him. Sometimes I\u2019ll call him a POS or a-hole. Matt gets angry, defensive, sad, and then starts insulting my dad.

She said some fairly insensitive things, but my husband\u2019s response was to listen, comfort me, and then go talk to his mother about why what she said was wrong and not acceptable.  If someone chooses the side of someone who attacks you and hurts you, they aren\u2019t a good partner.  You can deal with problematic in-laws with a spouse who takes your side, but there is no dealing with a spouse who doesn\u2019t choose you.", "NTA, so I\u2019m in the mental health field and an anxiety sufferer myself. I give you kudos honey because no way would the priest be talking to my therapist \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. This man is clearly so ignorant about mental health I have to laugh at this point. Unfortunately, our society still has a huge stigma when it comes to mental health especially the older generations since it used to be shameful to have a family member with any type of mental illness. Does he realize that millions of people in America have anxiety?? That anxiety is a normal response that we all experience from one time to another.

It is what it is, and you constantly making hurtful, yet truthful remarks is only making things worse.

I\u2019m so sorry. you were definitely abused by his dad and I\u2019m sad for you that your husband didn\u2019t stick up for you and put his dad in his place. You deserved more from all parties involved. I think it\u2019s a normal response to keep venting those things under these circumstances, but I would try your best to forgive. Not forgiving is only hurting you in the long run as the pain inside is torturous and Chris I\u2019m sure feels nothing and goes unbothered. Keep talking with your counselor and I hope you are able to heal. If you haven\u2019t already, make some sort of boundaries with Chris.

WHY DID YOU MARRY HIM????", "Did Matt stick up for you at all during the crap his father pulled? His father crossed so many boundaries that it boggles my mind.

But I still feel they ESH, because you have children with this man who now are being raised by someone who thinks so little of their mother, that he\u2019s willing to accept his father abusing you. \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t sound like either of their parents have a good grasp on how people deserve to be treated or how to set healthy boundaries, and it leaves them vulnerable to ending up in similarly dysfunctional relationships. Constantly making comments about their grandfather doesn\u2019t help this.\n\n*Editing to add: from your replies, it sounds like you have been brought up in a small, religious community, which makes me wonder if your \u201ctherapist\u201d was someone from that church as well. I know people who have belonged to churches that are invasive & controlling like this sounds. It took one of them being sexually assaulted as a teenager and then counseled that it was *her* fault, and the other having the leadership telling her that her husband drugging & raping her wasn\u2019t rape for them to finally leave. If you are in a situation like this, for the sake of your children - if not yourself - I hope you are able to recognize that this is not normal and leave the toxicity of your environment ASAP. *", "ESH you lied to your significant other and hid a major thing from him.

Giving this ultimatum will end your marriage. Stop speaking badly about your husband\u2019s dad because It obviously hurts your husband. Could you imagine someone constantly talking trash about someone you love dearly?\nI am sure if FIL is still talking about you poorly, you talking trash about him to your husband doesn\u2019t make you look any better in this.

We broke up because he was upset about that, and a couple other things, and then the professor told Chris. 2. Taking medication for social anxiety is not a life changing secret. It honestly never came up. I wasn\u2019t trying to be malicious", "Hmm, good point about the SO not knowing.  On the other hand, the FIL was way over the top.  End result remains, why did these two get married?  Why did they then have kids?", "The anxiety should have been discussed earlier.\n\nI find it weird that Chris just happened to have the conversation with an acquaintance that let the cat out of the bag. I have plenty of acquaintances that know I\u2019m on medication, but they don\u2019t know what meds. (Heck, I never remember the exact names!) Chris just happened to strike up a conversation with this acquaintance? Or did Chris look for people she knew to find dirt on her?\n\nAnd Chris had Matt\u2019s sister look into her meds\u2026 Did she tell him the meds, did the acquaintance just happen to know the names and dosages, or did Matt\u2019s sister going digging? (I\u2019m legit questioning if Matt\u2019s sister wasn\u2019t the \u201cacquaintance\u201d. Depending on where she works, it\u2019s plausible. My doctor is part of a huge local network. Any of the half a dozen hospitals and I don\u2019t even know how many clinics and doctor\u2019s offices could have access to my list of prescriptions. The pharmacy we use links with all of the others in the chain, so any in the chain can access my records. It would be a massive breech of ethics and policy, but possible.)", "Is this the FIL?", "Exactly!", "'Hiding her medical condition'? She has social anxiety, not a history of violent dissociative episodes.\n\nOP was totally within her rights to wait until she was ready to tell her partner about her meds. \n\nDepending on what the meds are for, I could feel differently; medication for a mental health condition that can put the person themselves or loved ones into distress or possible danger if meds aren't taken properly (like psychotic disorders) or a physical health condition that could also impact loved ones (like transmissible diseases or degenerative illnesses) should be aired imo before things get 'serious'. \n\nBut social anxiety? Nah.\n\nAnd he knew before he proposed, so clearly it didn't bother him.", "You mean the woman who was following the advice of her therapist as the post says? So you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to go around breaking HIPPA laws because I\u2019m an AH FIL who wasn\u2019t even a FIL (at the time) to go around stirring up shit with sons girlfriend who is working through an issue because she\u2019s hiding it? Wouldn\u2019t you think idk a conversation with her about it between the two of them would be more appropriate so you had context then ask her to disclose it to his son if she was serious about him? Nah let\u2019s just go try to sabotage the relationship because we can.", "Apparently for you it is a life changing secret though, because you hid it from your boyfriend for a year. You allowed him to get invested in a relationship, with you, over an issue that had broken up one of your previous relationships. So you knew it was a big deal to some people, and you still lied.  Don't BS and say it wasn't malicious.", "They'd been dating for a YEAR.  I am literally dumbfounded.  If I found out my SO had been lying to me for a year about a medical condition, I'd be like RED FLAG out the door.  Like this wasn't a month of dating.  They'd been together for a YEAR.  And everyone's like oh the dad's so out of line. \n\nI'm sure dad was thinking what I'd be thinking:  what else?  What else is she hiding, what else is she lying about, what else?", "I don't care if she has cold sores. She has a mental/emotional disorder for which she takes medication. He had the right to know.  \n\nOP was not within her rights to hide her medical condition, once they got serious.  You have the right to privacy NOT when it comes to hiding medical history from a potential partner.   She's a liar, she deceived him and it doesn't matter what the reason is.  \n\nShe has social anxiety but she allowed her boyfriend to get invested for a year. I'd have dumped her for lying.  There's no excuse to lie to your partner.  ZERO. \n\nThe fact that he doesn't mind being deceived, proves he needs therapy more than OP does.", "I don't give a shit if her therapist told her to lie to her fiance, if that's the truth, get a new therapist. And you have no way of knowing that the FIL broke HIPPA laws.  He found out from \"an acquaintance\". She doesn't say that the acquaintance had private access to her medical files.  \n\nShe lied. Her reasons for lying are irrelevant. If your therapist is telling you to lie for a year to your spouse, get a new therapist. And she doesn't say the therapist told her to lie. She said her therapist told her to tell him.", "Good point, I upgraded them to ESH.  (Matt's a doormat, and frankly, I still think dad crossed a fair bit of boundaries.)", "You must be single.", "You picked a very appropriate user name for yourself.", "You...you know social anxiety isn't *contagious* right?", "There is a big difference between lying to someone and disclosing a sensitive subject at the right time. Under your logic she should say hi my name is x I have social anxiety and take medication for it on the first date. She didn\u2019t give context to her mental condition or the seriousness of their relationship at the time the information was forcibly disclosed. None of your argument even addresses or changes the fact FIL handled this in probably the worst possible way instead of speaking with her first. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that she took advice from a PROFESSIONAL and thought she was doing the right thing. She wasn\u2019t acting with malicious intent as you\u2019re implying. If she was this would be a completely different conversation.", "Why because I refuse to put up with liars, lol I must be single? Just because you lie and deceive your partner doesn't mean all relationships are built on lies.  Sorry if you are in one, where you feel like lying is your only option. That sounds SUPER toxic. .", "I know. Being on reddit, I am surrounded by them.", "No but it can be debillitating and impact people's futures and how they maneuver in the world. And her partners have the right to know what they are signing up for? What if her meds stop working and she can't cope? What if she gets worse and can't leave the house?\n\nThere's lots of problems that aren't contagious.  Doesn't mean you get to hide them from romantic partners. Schizophrenia isn't contagious. I'd still want to know if I Was signing up for that life.  \n\nThe fact that everyone seems to feel like it's fine to deceive someone for a year about issues that might impact them really shows why everyone is now divorced and struggling to maintain relationships. \n\nBecause deception is just fine in a relationship.", "She was dating the man for a YEAR. She didn't say the professional told her to lie. She said the professional told her to tell him soon. A year is  more than enough time to tell him the truth. And no, my logic isn't blurt out immediately but it seems like OTHER people knew her medical history well enough to tell her FIL, and she's lying to her boyfriend for a YEAR.  It's malicious. He had the right to know her history BEFORE he got invested in their relationship.  ANY potential partner has the right to know what they are getting into in terms of a partner's health issues, BEFORE A YEAR IS OUT.  When they got serious, when they went to being boyfriend girlfriend, you owe your partner full disclosure. \n\nAnd if you don't think that's true, bullshit, because I guarantee if you found out your boyfriend was hiding a major health issue after you'd been together for a year, you'd be pissed. Or you're a doormat, like Matt.", "I think you\u2019re projecting some lying incident from your past in a really weird way.", "Whoosh. Right over your silly little head, wasn't it?", "If it was debilitating, he'd notice before a year was out.", "It depends what the issue is and the context. You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions that aren\u2019t specific in the post other than knowing it was a year. The other people who know, how long had she known them prior was it longer or shorter than Matt? It also depends on the severity of the issue and what it\u2019s about. Context matters here and no issue is exactly the same. Is her social anxiety like\u2026. I get nervous in crowds of people and she lives in a city with lots of people and therefore has a therapist to work through that because she has to be immersed in it? Point is you don\u2019t know the full context and you\u2019re making some massive assumptions like she lied about having some incurable disease. Believe it or not people have the right to tell people about their own medical history when and how they choose. Maybe this was some very blown out of proportion nonissue and Matt saw that. To your insult of being a doormat, no I would listen to someone when they chose to trust me with such information. I agree in general with you that a major issue should be disclosed if it has massive bearing on the relationship. The way this is presented it did not and FIL blew it out of proportion much like you are.", "LOL... and if she'd cheated on her boyfriend for a year, and people were condemning her for it, would you say that they were projecting some cheating incident from their past in a really weird way?\n\nLying is no different than cheating. It's a betrayal of trust.   The fact that you people all do it so easily, just means your moral compasses are fucked.", ".... LOL, yes, I'm the dense one here. Lord help the dim.", "Conditions change.  Are you under the impression that meds work the same always?", "I don't need to know anything except she lied to her SO for a year. She allowed him to get invested, while lying to him and hiding her medical history.  \n\nShe's a liar.  End of. Don't need to know more.  And Dad is right to be concerned about his son, dating a liar, who hides shit from him for a year. \n\nIf she'll lie and hide this, she'll lie and hide other things. Because that's what liars do.  There's always an excuse, there's always a reason.  And it's always bullshit.  She's a liar.", "Lol k dude. Omitting your prescription history and cheating on your partner are now the same in my fucked up moral compass, I\u2019ll make sure to jot that down somewhere.", "Who hurt you? Lying is clearly saying when asked if you have any medical issue or taking medication you say \u201cno.\u201d Disclosing information when you\u2019re comfortable sharing under advisement of your professional therapist is not the same.", "I realize that you think lying is okay.  Lie away.  If you want to be a liar, and defend liars, that's your choice.  \n\nSo if you found out the partner you'd been sleeping with for a year had herpes and just hadn't told you, you'd be totally fine with it?", "Nobody. Because unlike you, I don't allow liars in my life. It's cute you all justify lying until it happens to you.   \n\nWitholding information a partner has the right to know is lying.  And you know it. If you're over the age of 12, emotionally and intellectually."]}
