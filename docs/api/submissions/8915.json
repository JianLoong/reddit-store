At the end of the day she's effectively expecting you to be an ad hoc vegan so long as you're with her. You might not officially be a vegan, but she expects you to cook with her in mind and therefore function as one.\n\nYou're also not wrong for pointing out the one sided nature of this situation where you have to make all the compromises, but when you suggest you won't make anymore she starts bellyaching about how you're not fulfilling her needs.

It feels like you're giving up more because you are. You don't have any dietary restrictions and she does, so you will always be the one accommodating her in that situation because what a person can't eat trumps what another prefers to eat. Instead of tallying up what you've given up vs what she has, you should simply look at whether you two are still compatible and if the compromises you have to make to be with her are worth it to you.

Human nutrition and dietary requirements are complex and variable based on each person's needs and digestive abilities. \n\nIn this case, however, I think we're starting to just see a fundamental incompatibility. After reading comments, OP is giving up all of his dietary desires for his partner, with her ever stricter plant based diet, who is basically demanding OP go completely vegan at home. By attempting to remove the last animal product OP uses now, with split duties, every single meal must be strictly vegan to accommodate her. If either party is unwilling to change how meals work/that division of labor, or his partner continues to demand their shared home be animal product free because of her lifestyle desires, then they need to reevaluate their situation.\n\nAnd I say this as someone with significant medical/physical dietary restrictions in a household of 5, where I'm pretty much the only one with restrictions. I often cook for myself separately when the family wants certain meals, or my spouse, who is a damn saint tbh, will toss together something separate for me as he goes. When I cook, the family eats what I do, occasionally with an extra side/option if it's something no one else really likes/eats. And all this includes sometimes having to worry over cross contamination.
