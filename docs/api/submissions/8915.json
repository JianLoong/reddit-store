More nights eating fully vegan like his girlfriend wants (regardless of who cooks) is going to feel like a scarf ice to him. Plus, some of us *like* cooking.

One one hand, her trying to stop him from eating meat, dairy, etc, even going as far as to not allow any meat in the house at all, is completely controlling and unreasonable. He is allowed to eat what he wants. Just because she\u2019s vegan doesn\u2019t, at all, mean he has to be too. \n\nHowever, there is clearly some thing that can be done about this situation. Plenty of people have given vegan alternatives that act and taste the same as butter. People have named products. Still want to protest and say \u201cI\u2019m not using vegan butter\u201d? Fine. Another option is separating the dishes depending on what\u2019s cooked in butter and what isn\u2019t. You might have to rotate between looking after two meals whilst cooking, but once you get into it it\u2019s not all that difficult, plus it seems that OP genuinely likes cooking, so if anything this just adds more simmer in his step. Double the fun, at least if you enjoy cooking. Can\u2019t imagine that either, then there\u2019s a third option too, which is to start making meals together. She does her dish, he does his. It\u2019s not implementing the rotating system anymore, but if you\u2019re that hell-bent on it, then it\u2019s an decision absolutely worth considering. \n\nHim continuously making meals she cannot eat and saying \u201cwhat\u2019s the big deal it\u2019s just butter\u201d is ignoring the fact she\u2019s vegan. You can\u2019t be vegan if you still consume dairy. It\u2019s against the principle of it. She has conveyed this to him many times and he will not listen. Making your partner with dietary restrictions meals that they repeatedly tell you they cannot eat is just silly. She could absolutely be making her own vegan meals but he is still insisting on cooking meals she can\u2019t eat for her and then trying to force her to eat them. It is shitty conflict resolution. \n\nNot to mention I\u2019m seeing a fair few comments in here talking about how this is \u201ctypical vegan behaviour\u201d or whatever and that also rubs me the wrong way.

You cannot expect her to eat butter and she should not expect you to stop cooking with it. When she went completely vegan there should have been a discussion which likely would have led to you only cooking on occasions where you were willing to eliminate all animal products. My BIL married a vegan and they mostly make their own food. Some nights she makes a bigger vegan meal and they both eat it. On rare occasions he cooks something she can eat. This has worked for 20 years. Shared meals are a lovely part of family life for many people, and the turn taking for meal prep is nice too, but if it doesn\u2019t work for your situation, stop trying to force it.

Respecting her choice does not mean you have yo convert your eating habits to hers. She eats the way she wants, you eat the way you want. That\u2019s the problem today.

She should probably take responsibility for more meal prep, however if you are doing the cooking for both of you , you need to accommodate her.   \n\nVeganism becomes people's personality, and that turns into a world without compromise. If she is so strident,  she should cook dinner more often.\n\nHonestly, I don't think this is going to work out for you both. I mean, they are eggs from you backyard chickens, does she think you are abusing the birds?", "YTA. First of all, veganism is an ethical stance, not just a lifestyle. If someone would ask you to just kill someone this one time for them and to compromise, you would be horrified. Vegans see consuming animals as the same thing. You don't have to agree, but at least respect that it is an ethical stance that you can't just compromise on and eat some butter. That is unfair to expect.\n\nSo on to the issue. What you can compromise on is how you handle meals. So people saying you can't compromise isn't true. She wants to eat vegan and you don't. It is already a compromise for her to have deaf animals in the house. You might not think it is, and disagree, but it truly is. It is also better to look at what you CAN compromise on. And that is the way you handle meals instead of what she eat. Possibilities are for example:\n\n1) you cook two similar meals. Just one vegan and one non-vegan.\n2) you cook a vegan meal and you can supplement meat or other ingredients at the table. There are plenty of meals where this works, such as pasta where you can add the cheese later. You can even take a meal from the pan for your gf ad then melt some butter in the last few minutes. \n3) you each make your own meals.\n\nIt just seems kind of weird to me that you prepare meals for each other, but you always choose to do it in a way she can't eat. I love cooking for my bf, because it makes him happy. I would never consider making something he doesn't like, because he needs to eat too and it would make eating really unpleasant for him. I don't want that. I want to be someone he can share his life with and make things easier for him. Not harder.\n\nPlenty of ways to keep eating waht ever you want without compromising her ethical stance. Work on that with her. Insisting she should compromise by eating butter is just selfish.\n\nHowever, if she doesn't want to have meat at the table at all, of course it stops there. Then she is an asshole and it is better to start evaluating your relationship.", "Info: is the issue that she\u2019s not eating your food or that she is expecting you to cook different food for her?

Hubs and I are pretty aligned as far as this goes, in that we each understand and respect that the other person is being conscious about their choices. (I will say, if he didn't give a rat's ass for animal welfare, ate meat that was terribly produced or for every meal, it would probably be a different story; and this is true for lots of other folks / beliefs that are unconscious / inherited, rather than consciously owned.) \n\nIf I value personal integrity and individual choice, then I don't have the right to demand that everyone live according to my personal beliefs. It doesn't mean I have to love or spend my life with someone I diverge wildly from, it just means if I want them to let me live my life, then I have to let them live theirs. I cannot demand respect I am not willing to give.
