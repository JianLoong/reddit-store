More nights eating fully vegan like his girlfriend wants (regardless of who cooks) is going to feel like a scarf ice to him. Plus, some of us *like* cooking.

One one hand, her trying to stop him from eating meat, dairy, etc, even going as far as to not allow any meat in the house at all, is completely controlling and unreasonable. He is allowed to eat what he wants. Just because she\u2019s vegan doesn\u2019t, at all, mean he has to be too. \n\nHowever, there is clearly some thing that can be done about this situation. Plenty of people have given vegan alternatives that act and taste the same as butter. People have named products. Still want to protest and say \u201cI\u2019m not using vegan butter\u201d? Fine. Another option is separating the dishes depending on what\u2019s cooked in butter and what isn\u2019t. You might have to rotate between looking after two meals whilst cooking, but once you get into it it\u2019s not all that difficult, plus it seems that OP genuinely likes cooking, so if anything this just adds more simmer in his step. Double the fun, at least if you enjoy cooking. Can\u2019t imagine that either, then there\u2019s a third option too, which is to start making meals together. She does her dish, he does his. It\u2019s not implementing the rotating system anymore, but if you\u2019re that hell-bent on it, then it\u2019s an decision absolutely worth considering. \n\nHim continuously making meals she cannot eat and saying \u201cwhat\u2019s the big deal it\u2019s just butter\u201d is ignoring the fact she\u2019s vegan. You can\u2019t be vegan if you still consume dairy. It\u2019s against the principle of it. She has conveyed this to him many times and he will not listen. Making your partner with dietary restrictions meals that they repeatedly tell you they cannot eat is just silly. She could absolutely be making her own vegan meals but he is still insisting on cooking meals she can\u2019t eat for her and then trying to force her to eat them. It is shitty conflict resolution. \n\nNot to mention I\u2019m seeing a fair few comments in here talking about how this is \u201ctypical vegan behaviour\u201d or whatever and that also rubs me the wrong way. People\u2019s inability to see that there\u2019s more at play here other than being a \u201ctypical stuck-up vegan\u201d is pretty crappy if I\u2019m being honest.\n\nEHS", "She is expecting joint meals where he cannot eat butter.
