He is the sweetest boy and the love of my life. He would say that he loves his Daddy more than anything in the world.. Yesterday I took him to Yogurtland before coming him.

Besides anything I would had gotten you would had melted by the time we got home. You didn't miss anything.\n\nHe then said I never do anything for him. So I said \"I adopted you and if all you have to complain about is frozen yogurt then I did a pretty good job.\" He got up and left and has been giving me the silent treatment.

I can't imagine the pressure that puts on a kid to remind them that I adopted you, as if it can be rescinded.\n\nYou couldn't just stick with the main point that you DO take him out often?\n\nYour wording in general sounds off. \"I fostered a few kids I didn't like...\"  Maybe it's tone, but I can understand \"we weren't a good match.\" You just come across as cruel whether intentionally or not.", "YTA. \n\nThis isn't about Yogurtland, it is about you throwing his adoption in his face and making  a false equivalency of him becoming family to getting a scoop of fro-yo. \n\nBut I do think you need to take a beat and reflect. The way you talk about Zachary and Josh is very different and perhaps Josh is feeling like he's on the outs with you. Teenagers are interesting creatures where they push the boundaries of your affection for them. They want to know that you still care even if they're being moody, whiny and complainy. Your job as a parent is to love and care for them through that. \n\nYou crossed a very serious line here. I suggest you make a plan to make amends and **never** throw his adoption in his face like it was a favour you did him.", ">I also adopted another kid who is now 7 (Zachary). He is the sweetest boy and the love of my life.\n\nYTA for this statement alone.  Of course your older child feels left out because you obviously favor the younger one!", "\"I also adopted another kid who is now 7 (Zachary). He is the sweetest boy and the love of my life. He would say that he loves his Daddy more than anything in the world.\" I'm sure that this comment shows everyone how you treat Josh in comparison to Zachary. I'm sure you show favoritism a lot more than one time getting frozen yogurt. And then make a comment like that to Josh about adopting him. Yes, you are the asshole. YTA.", "YTA. Adopting him isn't a get out of free card used to stop his whining. He's a teen. They whine and mope while they try to figure out their life. Tell him you are sorry for your rude comment and do better next time.", "Your other son is the love of your life? You realize you have two kids right?\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your response was designed to shut him down, which it did. In that moment he wanted to feel important, even if he knows that the ice-cream would have melted.  He needed patience not you busting out the nuclear option that you adopted him so he doesn\u2019t get to feel upset about anything ever.  Of course he wants what his brother wants. That\u2019s the way it works.", "YTA - no one is noticing how he \u201ctest drove\u201d kids for adoption but \u201cdidn\u2019t like them\u201d??? What a weirdo", "YTA. You don't get to hold that against a kid. He didn't ask you adopt him. No one asked him if he wanted to go with you. I'm glad you're taking care of these kids, but never again use this against them.\n\nApologize (teens need to learn this anyway). You can still tell him he's old enough to keep it together when he faces minor inconveniences, and you expect more maturity from him. But not because he owes you for adopting him.", "YTA. A parent should never throw that in an adopted child\u2019s face. Imagine how that makes him feel. As it is adopted children struggle with feeling of abandonment and not being worthy. 14 is a difficult age. They get good at challenging you and are trying to define their identity outside of the family. It would have been much better to lean into the fact that it would have melted had you gotten him something and to offer to make it up at a later time. Reinforce that you love him, not that you gave him a home. That\u2019s table stakes for a family. From what you\u2019ve written it seems like the 7-year old might be the clear favorite in your family and the 14- year old is starting to feel comfortable articulating it to you. Spend more 1:1 time with the older kid and give him some of your undivided attention or he may carry these resentments out the door and away from you before you know it. He\u2019s already 14; 18, 19, 20 aren\u2019t far behind. Cement that relationship while you can.", "YTA. \n\nYou're exactly the type of person who thinks that adoption is some sort of martyr sacrifice and you're \"saving\" that child. That viewpoint is incredibly damaging to kids and incredibly ignorant on your part. And the part where you said you fostered a few kids that you didn't like.... just big ick. You made Josh feel like he owes you because you decided to \"rescue.\" him. He's not a puppy. You need serious help on learning how to relate to your kids.", "YTA. He\u2019s a 14 year old kid who saw his younger brother being doted on all the time. You literally called the youngest the love of your life. Your acting like it\u2019s just about the frozen yoghurt. Your forgetting that he\u2019s an adopted child who probably has some attachment issues along with that due to being 14! Your supposed to be his parent and you threw it in his face", "YTA\n\nIt's not appropriate to use a deeply personal and sensitive aspect of your son's life, such as being adopted, as a weapon during an argument. While frustration is understandable, bringing up such a sensitive topic in a heated moment can be hurtful and damaging to your relationship with your son. Instead, it would be more constructive to address his feelings and concerns with empathy and understanding, without resorting to using his adoption as a way to win an argument.", "YTA - it isn\u2019t about being \u201cright\u201d when you raise a kid or a martyr complex for adopting them. In every way possible, your son knows he\u2019s adopted and of all people, doesn\u2019t need you to remind him over something so trivial.", "YTA... that is a bit harsh honestly. You cannot hold the adoption over the adopted kids head. You make him feel like a burden or worse a mistake with that. 14 year olds are moody. All teenagers are. And his reaction was perfectly in line of a normal teenager.\n\nYour reaction was... cruel almost.", "YTA. he\u2019s still a kid. you could have told him you\u2019d take him another time. but to act like you did him a favor by adopting him is cruel. you signed up for this responsibility and now you\u2019re throwing it into his face, for what? wanting icecream? YTA dude. be better", "YTA just reading your post I can tell who your favorite is. I couldn\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for the older(non favorite) child.", "YTA\n\nJosh probably has a whole ton of insecurities already about being adopted.  You referring to your current favourite Zachary as being the love of your life is probably something that Josh as picked up on.  \n\nYou have two kids.  Treat them equally.", "YTA\n\nYou should never use the fact that you adopted a child against them in an argument. This is only going to make them feel like they should be grateful they have a family and are not allowed to feel their feelings. \n\nChildren/teens are going to get upset and complain about stuff that does not seem like a big deal to adults, that is just a fact. It is your job as the parent to help them navigate these feelings. There were plenty of other ways you could have dealt with this situation without using their adoption as a factor like explaining that it was not your intention to leave them out and that you thought it was not a big deal because they were out with their friends, next time you will let them know so they can decide if they want to come too but if they are out and can't be reached and it is a last min plan, they may miss out but this doesn't mean you love or care for them any less.", "YTA  It seems pretty clear from this post you have an obvious favorite... your kids can see it too. Your oldest is probably pretty hurt that his dad has a favorite child. So little things like going out for a treat aren't just letting things. They're you treating your favorite child and not your older one. \n\nThen you took a minor thing and made it a major thing.  Saying what you said is the equivalent of telling him he's a burden that you took on,  even though it was your decision to start a family. It was uncalled for and if you keep at it, you're not going to have much of a relationship with him when he's an adult.", "You shouldve never adopted him if you were going to throw it in his face. He sees that you favor his sibling. Spend more one on one time with your older son and apologize to him.", "YTA. You don't use being adopted as leverage, just like a parent who births a child wouldn't say 'well I birthed you and if all you have to complain about is.....'. It's not a child's choice to be born, or to put in the situation of needing adoption. You're even more of the ahole because you literally just said that one of your children is the love of your life, but the problem is you have two children. I imagine your oldest son has noticed this, and this one yoghurt thing is just one thing.", "YTA. I'm an adoptive parent, and this is a terrible comment to make to an adopted child. Adopted children don't owe their adoptive parents gratitude. Adoption involves losing your biological family, and with that comes trauma. Having your adoptive parent throw in your face that you should be grateful is not helpful. I recommend educating yourself further so that you don't do serious damage to your relationship with your son. You can check out Jeanette Yoffe on Youtube, and some good books to read would be The Primal Wound, 20 Things Adopted Kids Wished Their Adoptive Parents Knew, and The Connected Child. \n\nAlso, how you talk about Zachary compared to Josh makes it obvious that you favor him, so it's understandable why Josh may feel left out. Josh is also at the age to be going through puberty, and it's normal for that to come with some moodiness. I understand that it may be frustrating to hear complaining, but you are the parent, and rather than responding with comments designed to hurt him, you should be focused on responding in a way that will be the healthiest for your child and your relationship. A better response would have been to explain that he wasn't home when you left but that you would love to take him somewhere, just the two of you, in the future. Then you could have gently addressed how you'd like him to voice his frustrations next time if you didn't like the way he approached it.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m an adoptee.\nNo kid, especially adoptees, should be grateful to their parents for *checks notes* raising them and being a parent.", "YTA- throwing that comment  in a kids face was cruel. He will probably always remember that comment in life. There is no after the fact trying to make up for that comment. Call a therapist.", "YTA, he didn't ask to be adopted so you shouldn't throw it in his face and expect him to be grateful for that. It makes it seem as though your love and care for him has strings attached.", "YTA - Your kid is at an age where he's going to challenge you and be jerky. That's part of the whole growing up process. You reacted to this minor push back by throwing the fact he's adopted in his face. Which is not at all a proportional reaction. It's also an amazingly shitty thing to do in general.", "YTA.\n\nYou chose to adopt because you weren't in a position to have kids, not because you wanted to provide love and stability to a child who needs it. That boy did not choose to be abandoned or to be adopted and you don't get to hold it over him as though you were doing him a favour when it was to satisfy your own wishes. What's even more messed up is that you seem to have no love for Josh but you dote on Zachary, this is incredibly unhealthy.", "YTA\u2026 and this is really concerning. Throwing that in his face is a horrible thing to do, and will lead to life long trauma. Think about what he already goes through, and now think about what you\u2019ve added to that. Actually disgusting the way you clearly lack any empathy for your own child. Seems like you\u2019re the a**hole in not just this situation, but in general.\n\nHe will remember that comment forever, and that\u2019s really sad.", "\"Whining and complaining about stupid stuff\" also known as being 14.\n\nYou don't get a gold medal for adopting. It doesn't give you a free pass to be an AH and you using it against your orphan son makes you an AH of the highest order. You know what he would have loved way more than being adopted, not having his biological parents ripped from him before he could form life long memories.\n\nAlso, your entire attitude is just wrong. 'I fostered a few kids I didn't like' who cares what you like. Fostering is about providing a home and safety to some of the most vulnerable children in society and it isn't to fill your need for a family. They are not a consolation prize because your life didn't go the way you wanted.\n\nYTA.", "calling one of your children the love of your life says a lot about what you think of the other one. throwing the adoption in your sons face over something so minor is weird man", "YTA just from how clearly you favor your youngest. If it\u2019s this apparent in a Reddit post, it definitely bleeds into your kid\u2019s daily life.

I fostered a few kids that I didn't like and was about to walk until they paired me with a 2yo who had lost both parents and had no family. Josh is now 14 and a very well adjusted kid aside from bouts of whining and complaining about stupid stuff.\n\nI also adopted another kid who is now 7 (Zachary). He is the sweetest boy and the love of my life. He would say that he loves his Daddy more than anything in the world.. Yesterday I took him to Yogurtland before coming him. Josh started to complain that I didn't get him anything. I said you weren't even home when I left. You were out playing with your friends. Besides anything I would had gotten you would had melted by the time we got home. You didn't miss anything.\n\nHe then said I never do anything for him. So I said \"I adopted you and if all you have to complain about is frozen yogurt then I did a pretty good job.\" He got up and left and has been giving me the silent treatment. I called him out on it and said I've taken him out to Yogurtland hundreds of times with just me and him but he's still mad.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm guessing everything I wrote in the previous paragraph isn't real but again, you're talking about a child. This never was about froyo but about his sense of self-worth.
