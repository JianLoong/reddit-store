During this time our daughter kind of did her own thing because she just leaves adults alone when they are eating.  I finished my 6inch half of the sub during this time and then went on to entertain my daughter while my wife continued eating.  Before i left the table, I noticed my wife had only eaten a couple bites of her half of the sub.  About ten minutes later during a tickle session with my daughter, she ran into the kitchen and wanted to involve her mom who refused at this time and stated \u201cshe was eating her food slowly on purpose\u201d So our daughter came back to be tickled by me.  After some time, around 5:15pm, I left the house to go to the local grocery store because they have a bar and offer half price growler fills on Saturdays.   A lot of my friends go to the store for this deal, and that usually results in having a beer or two along with some conversations while there.  So I come home 1 1/2 hours later at 6:45.  At this time my daughter still wanted to play and was trying to engage with my wife. Instead of participating my wife said to me, \u201cWill you please play with her because I have still not been able to finish my sandwich.\u201d  So I responded \u201cOf course I will, but you\u2019ve been eating that slowly on purpose for hours now, so I wish you\u2019d eat it already.\u201d  And she got so upset about what I said and claimed I was yelling at her\u2026(I didn\u2019t even raise my voice about it once) and she\u2019s acting like I am so mean.
