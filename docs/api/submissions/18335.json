I finished my 6inch half of the sub during this time and then went on to entertain my daughter while my wife continued eating.

After some time, around 5:15pm, I left the house to go to the local grocery store because they have a bar and offer half price growler fills on Saturdays.   A lot of my friends go to the store for this deal, and that usually results in having a beer or two along with some conversations while there.  So I come home 1 1/2 hours later at 6:45.

I definitely don\u2019t think that it is necessary to get a manicure or a pedicure for work, so if I were your husband my response would be that if you don\u2019t want to do it, you should stop. Never once have I ever given a second\u2019s thought about the state of anyone\u2019s hands or feet whilst listening to work presentations. Never once has any of this stuff that some women think matters affected any promotion or pay rise I gave, or any feeling about the competence of anyone I have worked with. This is a ridiculous beauty standard set by other women that, in fact, many many women completely opt out of and they suffer not a jot for it at work.\n\nPeople usually do have manicures and pedicures as relaxation time, and they are sold as gifts for that reason. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really fair to equate that to time spent working or doing chores. To be honest this is a bit like when I fly business class.

If it cost me anything personally I wouldn\u2019t be doing it, and conversely if I paid for it myself I would consider it a gift to myself.

It drives me insane that my wife never tidies up as she goes around the house so stuff accumulates; I prefer to pick things up as I move around, put things away whilst cooking etc when we\u2019ve finished with them, and washing up at the end of the night. But it drives her insane that I don\u2019t want to do it at the time she thinks it should be done, when I have just finished work or immediately after dinner.
