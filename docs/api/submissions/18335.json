I finished my 6inch half of the sub during this time and then went on to entertain my daughter while my wife continued eating.  Before i left the table, I noticed my wife had only eaten a couple bites of her half of the sub.

After some time, around 5:15pm, I left the house to go to the local grocery store because they have a bar and offer half price growler fills on Saturdays.   A lot of my friends go to the store for this deal, and that usually results in having a beer or two along with some conversations while there.  So I come home 1 1/2 hours later at 6:45.
