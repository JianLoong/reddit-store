Because it's definitely not normal to spend that long on a sandwich, and the fact that she got so defensive immediately *definitely* means it's not about the sandwich.\n\nGo talk to her. Don't be aggressive, but don't let her sidestep the question (or claim it's just about the sandwich). This could be anything from depression to an eating disorder to a simple hatred of those fucking Subway sandwiches, but you won't know what it is until you ask her. \n\nMeanwhile, the rest of us will continue to misread your comments, accuse you of not giving your wife time to herself, and argue about whether her spa visits and tanning are the equivalent of chores.", "It\u2019s not a competition. You parented your own child for 2 whole hours?! Do you want a medal?? And judging by the specificity of the time you mentioned you clearly were keeping track of every minute.

You knew what you were doing and so did she. YTA.", "Maybe she\u2019s annoyed at you drinking with your friends. There could be many reasons for this.", "Whether that is accurate or not, clearly, something is wrong and she needs some kind of assistance/support.", "100000% I thought it was just my own issues coming into play coloring my view, but a couple hours to eat a sandwich and then still not being done with it an hour and a half later sounds like something I would have done in the throes of my ed - I\u2019m also just now realizing I heated up leftovers at 8:30 tonight and it\u2019s 11:30 and I\u2019m just now finishing them \ud83d\ude05", "OP said the kid goes to bed at 8pm. So that\u2019s 10\nHours M-F while he WFH (9-6, he said) and seemingly the wife is caring for their child during that time. So, no.

Doesn't sound much like folding laundry now , does it ?", "It's very sexist of you to assume OP's wife is responsible for the cooking, cleaning, and laundry just because she's a woman.", "Working out is what quite a few people consider their \"fun time\" . Not everyone sees the gym as a necessary evil on par with visiting the dentist...", ">So for two hours in the evening your wife has free time? Is the kid at home with her all the rest of this time?\n\nWhat happened to basic comprehension skill? The wife is free from 6 pm. The kid has bed time at 8 pm.

Wow , how sad for her...", "This is the answer.", "Don't be disingenuous, OP was obviously just making the point that he gave his wife two uninterrupted hours to herself where she *should* have been able to eat a six inch sandwich.", "I used to be in the same boat as OP in terms of work then childcare. I spent pretty much all the time I could with the kids, but it didn't leave me with much time. Wife was a stay at home mom at the time. I knew she needed a break at the end of the day. That was fine. But working to provide for the family is also part of parental responsibilities. Because one partner works doesn't mean they are not doing their part with the kids. If you read OPs comments he does a lot of the weekend time. He's seemingly understanding that she's overwhelmed. He probably is also overwhelmed. Work-kid-sleep 5 days a week. Then the lions share of the childcare on the weekend too.\n\nYour perspective here was wholly \"the wife is tired\" and you took no time to consider that the one working is also doing his part.", "It\u2019s not only two hours I parented my child! lol \nI parented my child from the moment she woke up this morning.

I love the lengths people go to - to excuse shitty  behavior", "She gets to do it every day", "The night before was time for herself.

I literally asked: is she getting time to herself or is she doing chores all alone and he\u2019s considering the solo chore time as \u201ctime to herself.\u201d  I literally asked a question.  That is the opposite of assuming something.", "That's great for you, but an hour of someone touching your face, hands, or feet or an hour surrounded by people in a gym or stripping naked to get greased up and lay in a tanning bed or worse a spray booth? Incredibly overstimulating especially if you're already touched out. Methinks a woman who takes almost 4 hours to eat a sandwich probably isn't finding a lot of time to read in peace.\n\nI love the result of having my nails done, but I need a shower and a nap immediately afterwards because the entire process is sensory hell & I hate being touched that long.

Lmao. You can shop online, play games online, work out at your own home and my mom even hs a tanning bed in her basement.

Who knows what these peoples lives are even like lmao", "She could be an asshole, but the person you are responding to is probing for specific answers that would be a sign of depression.
