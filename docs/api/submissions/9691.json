I only own a single outfit (with copies for each day of the week) and it's not a fancy one (think stretch pants and a t-shirt level formality). If I brush my hair it means someone's coming over.

You don't know what I do, or why I do it. \n\nAnd yeah, the pressure is real, but women also need to be allowed to enjoy girly things, for their own selves, and not because society. You know what's kinda fucked? A little boy wants a manicure and people fall all over how supportive his parents are (and rightly so!) but a little girl is always, always going to get told SHE doesn't really like sparkly nails, she's only doing it because people told her she should like it, and somehow that makes her dumb and disappointing. Sometimes girly shit just makes you feel good, man.\n\nPoint being, we can't know why the new mom wanted to feel like her best self, and even if we did, we're not the arbiters of whether or not her \"why\" is good enough. Also, the last thing a new mom needs from her family or from random strangers is critical judgy comments about how her appearance is disappointing.", "Yes, cos all women wear makeup/high heels etc to be beautiful (for men i presume) and not just because feeling put together makes them feel good.\ud83d\ude44", "There is that, but some people feel better that way. Not just in a \"this is what society requires of me,\" way but in a \"Kuzco giving himself finger guns in the mirror because he looks attractive and knows it,\" way.\n\nSome people just like looking put together. \n\nAlso, we don't actually know HOW put together this woman actually is. I get the impression that anything above a decent blouse and some jeans is excessive to the OP.\n\nIs she getting dressed nice enough to get into a five star restaurant with celebrities or nice enough to be consider business casual but pretty? Some makeup, a maternity dress and nice shoes don't scream \"doing it for the patriarchy\" to me."]}
