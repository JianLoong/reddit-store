We have a eight years old daughter together and a baby (7months) \n\nMy step son got a part time job around Christmas, he works in Starbucks. He's using his money to buy mostly gaming equipment, games and clothes, but sometimes he also buys snacks. They're not special snacks or anything, just Doritos or chips from the store. He likes to have some bags to eat while he's playing. \n\nHe brought a big pack of stuff yesterday after work, when he came home my daughter asked him what he brought and started looking though the stuff, he had some candy and she asked for some. He told her those candies were his and told her to not touch it, she insisted on having some and as he said no again they started arguing and she then cried. \n\nShe came crying to me (waking up my youngest son, who's teething btw) and told me what happened. So I told my son to just share some candy with her and help. He argued that he brought it with his own money so he doesn't have to give her anything. I told him that we buy most of our groceries with his dad's and my money so we could use the same logic, he continued arguing until I threatened him to ground him and he finally gave in. He was upset afterwards.\n\nWhen my husband came home he told him what happened and after dinner my husband called mw off for treating step son as a little kid, he said that since he's being responsible with a job and getting his own money then he should get to decide if he wants to share his snacks or not and told me to not get my frustration out on his son.

So YTA for that.\n\nAn 8 year old is old enough to know \"no, that's not yours\" so she's kinda an ass too. And if you enable her entitled tantrums, YTA for that too.\n\nAnd as for \" I told him that we buy most of our groceries with his dad's and my money\" \u2014 it is your LEGAL OBLIGATION to buy  food for your children. And the 8 year old is not his child, she's yours, so your \"logic\" is actually nonsense.\n\nDon't be the Evil Stepmother.", "YTA.  She's your child, buy her snacks.  Also poor form to teach her that crying will get her what she wants.  She's 8, too old for that shit.  Also, you paying to feed your minor stepson isn't comparable.  That is you literally doing your job as a parent.", "YTA. Those are his snacks and you're teaching your daughter that she can get whatever she wants when she throws a tantrum. You don't get to decide what he does with the stuff he buys with his own money.", "\"I told him that we buy most of our groceries with his dad's and my money so we could use the same logic\"\n\nNo, you can't, because you are adults who are legally and morally responsible for feeding your children. He's a teenager who has no such responsibility to his sister. Major YTA. He is working to earn money that he can do whatever he likes with. Meanwhile, you are raising your daughter to be a spoiled brat who can't hear the word \"no\" because she'll just throw a tantrum to get what she wants.", "YTA. Your husband and you share your money With your minor children because they are YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. Your stepson didn\u2019t father your child, so he shouldn\u2019t be responsible for using HIS money to pay for candy for YOUR CHILD.", "\"I told him that we buy most of our groceries with his dad's and my money so we could use the same logic...\"\n\nUmm, not at all.  You and hubby are legally obligated to provide food for your children.  Stepson has no similar responsibility.  Eight years old is not too young to understand that \"no\" can a complete end of discussion.  YTA.", "YTA. Your stepson bought that with his own money, for himself. Who made you the snack police?\n\nAlso, it\u2019s never ever ever ever cool to imply or tell children that you\u2019re doing them a favor by feeding them. You are obligated by law to care for the children in your custody; your children didn\u2019t ask to be born. \n\nFinally I think it\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s \u201cmy stepson\u201d when he\u2019s working and playing video games but he\u2019s \u201cmy son\u201d when you\u2019re telling him what to do. I don\u2019t know what it means but I think it\u2019s worth pointing out.", "YTA. \n\n> She came crying to me (waking up my youngest son, who's teething btw) and told me what happened. So I told my son to just share some candy with her and help.\n\nSo instead of dealing with your daughter for throwing a fit that woke up the baby you instead told your stepson to \"reward\" her bad behavior just so you didn't have to actually put in any effort at parenting your daughter.\n\n> I told him that we buy most of our groceries with his dad's and my money so we could use the same logic,\n\nWell, no. The LAW says you have to provide him with food; there is no law in existence that says he has to provide anything for your spoiled daughter. \n\nYour husband and stepson are 100% right.\n\nYou owe him reimbursement for the candy (not just money - you need to go to the store to replace what you forced him to give up), an apology, and a promise to actually parent your daughter in future instead of acting like a stepmonster by putting the entire fault and burden on him when he did nothing wrong.", "YTA. If he bought it with his own money, he should decide what to do with it. Yes, it is not nice that he did not want to share but they are his, so the choice is his too. It is not like he is withholding meals from her. So I don't think threatening him with grounding and forcing him to give her his things was the way to go. I can understand why the father was upset. Teaching the 8 year old to cry and get their way is not a great option. You could have just told them that the snacks are his and his decision to do what he wants with them.", "YTA Your daughter is 8, not 2. Teach her no. Your step son worked for that money and unless you have some type of agreement about how he can spend *his* money, he's free to use it for himself and not share. \n\nAnd saying that you can use the same logic for the groceries you buy? No you can't. You are the parents; that is literally your job. It is NOT his job to provide candy to your daughter.", "YTA\n\nWhat you should have done in that situation was explain to your daughter that he bought that candy with his own money, so it is his, and no amount of crying or tantrum throwing (even if it wakes up the baby) will get her way for her. You could\u2019ve told her she could do some chores to earn money to buy her *own* candy. Such a teachable moment. \nBut you copped out and threatened your stepson in order for YOU to not have to deal with the tantrum.", "YTA, this could have been an opportunity to teach your daughter about boundaries and how sharing is nice if someone wants to but it's ok if they don't- instead you steamrolled your stepson and taught your daughter if she cries she gets her way. Spoiled brat in the making.", "> who\u2019s teething btw\n\nINFO: how is this relevant?", "YTA\n\nYou're putting your daughter's basic wants over your stepson's boundaries because your baby is teething. All this is going to do is alienate your stepson and make your daughter believe she's entitled to things she didn't earn. Not ok. His money, his choice.", "YTA. he's not your son and he's almost 18, you were annoyed he made your kid cry by setting a boundary and then overstepped by threatening him with a punishment your husband probably would never have let stand. You are in the wrong. leave the kid alone", "YTA.  Can you not understand the difference between parents feeding kids and kids spending their money on it.   Your husband needs to stand up for his kid.  I hope the kid moves in with his mom and your DH has to pay child support.  YOu should not be able to ground him.\n\nDid you pay him back, or are you a total AH", "Oh, if she woke up the baby then she\u2019s definitely entitled to eat snacks that she has no claim to.  /s  YTA", "You already know YTA.  \n\nCome here and give me your candy if you are so into sharing.  I like peanut M&Ms.  See you tomorrow, OP!\n\nWhat, not OK to demand because it's bought with your money?  Huh.  Who knew. \n\nThis is what's called a teaching moment, so little kids learn early that disappointment doesn't kill anyone.  Evidently, your husband knows about these, but you don't.", "YTA\n\nHe earned that money and chose to spend it on snacks and things.

He, however, is not legally obligated to provide for, or indulge, your kid.  \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou're the definition of nightmare step mother.", "Did you seriously compare a teenager using their own money for treats to you and his father buying family groceries??? Seriously, his father has a LEGAL OBLIGATION to, oh I don't know, feed his child! \n\nVery much YTA - both for making him share his hard earned snacks and for making it seem like it would be reasonable to withhold family groceries as a tit-for-tat lesson.", "YTA - You and your husband are adults and responsible for feeding the children in your care. Your step son is a kid and he is not responsible for buying snacks for his sister. Do you really not see the difference between those two things?\n\nIt honestly sounds like you were not in the mood to parent your daughter and bullying your step son was easier than teaching your daughter to understand the word no.", "YTA - he has a job and works for his money. It's his money. Period. \n\nSecond, he doesn't have children to pay for, you do. So if YOUR daughter wants snacks and candy that's your responsibility financially. All you're doing is teaching your daughter the poor lesson of entitlement. We don't need more of those people in this world. It's also teaching your step son he has no agency and no control over his own money. \n\nI'm a mother to a 19 year old who also happens to work at Starbucks and I know the crap he has to put up with to earn his paycheck. This is pretty foul, lady.", "YTA, set the 8yo up with some basic chores to earn some money. I'll wager she wouldn't want to share either.", "YTA. Pay him back and apologize. Tell him you were frustrated and handled it wrong and it won\u2019t happen again, and that he is in charge of his own money.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re legally required to feed him. He is a minor and you are his caregiver. It\u2019s not the same situation at all.", "YTA. He is right. He doesn\u2019t have to share if he doesn\u2019t want to. Also, you\u2019re supposed to provide him with food because he\u2019s a minor. Ridiculous comparison.", "Yta good job, you just taught her that she can cry and have a temper tantrum and get what she wants.", "YTA. And while you\u2019re at it, teach that little brat to stop looking through other people\u2019s shit.", "YTA. Your daughter threw a tantrum over candy that wasn\u2019t hers,  woke up your teething baby, and gets rewarded with the candy? That\u2019s bad parenting and clear favoritism", "YTA - if you bought it with your money, then you\u2019d have a point. You\u2019re required as his parent to provide food for him.\n\nSpecial stuff that he buys with his own money he doesn\u2019t have to share.", "YTA - His money, his candy, his decision.  Forcing him to share with your daughter is a violation of his space.  You can encourage him to share.  That is good manners.  Forcing him to share makes you TA.", "Yta.\n\nFirst, it was a GREAT lesson to teach your daughter, that all she had to do is whine to get her way. \n\nSecond, you are teaching your son he has to hide things to not be harrased. \n\nThird, ITS HIS MONEY. if your daughter wants snacks, as a parent, it's your job to provide them.", "YTA- You just taught your daughter she can cry, wake up the baby AND get candy for doing it. Shitty parenting.", "YTA.  \n\nYou're teaching her a horrible sense of entitlement (and cry to get your way), and being completely disrespectful of his ... well everything.  \n\nHis time,  effort,  decisions,  boundaries... Why should he work for anything if you're just going to give it away without respecting his request?", "YTA. It was his money he worked for, he is not obligated to share things he bought with his own money. You on the other hard are obligated to feed him with your own money because you are parent to this child. Just because he has a part time job doesn't suddenly mean he has to pay his own way or pay for other family members if he doesn't want to. Your argument does not work here. \n\nYour daughter shouldn't be snooping through his purchases, seeking out things she wants. You shouldn't be enabling it by punishing her brother when he told her no. This tells your daughter she is entitled to his stuff, which she is not. \n\nThe real reason is you didn't want to deal with your teething baby and daughter having a fit about not getting what she wants. Understandable but that doesn't make it your stepson's problem and it doesn't make you in the right. \n\nYou could have offered to reimburse him or talk to your daughter about personal property but instead you punished him, for something he shouldn't have been punished for. Your husband is right.", "YTA", "YTA. He is right. He doesn\u2019t have to share if he doesn\u2019t want to. Also, you\u2019re supposed to provide him with food because he\u2019s a minor. Ridiculous comparison.", "YTA. While it would be generous of your stepson to share with his half sister, he's right, he bought the snacks for himself with his own money.  He's not obligated to share his snacks anymore than he would be obligated to share is gaming equipment or his clothes. \n\nWould you make your eight year old share things she bought for herself with birthday or Christmas money?  Eight is old enough to learn that she isn't entitled to something just because she wants it.", "YTA for being the evil stepmother.  Be better.", "YTA. It's his hard earned money, and he can spend whatever he wants with it, and how he wants to spend it. You can't force him to share things that be bought with his own money. It's completely up to him wether he wants to share things. If he wanted to share it, he would do so gladly, but in this case where he didn't, you should've just left him be. I hope you've apologized to your stepson since this.", "Jesus of course YTA. There is a big difference between buying groceries for your CHILDREN and your step-son buying himself a treat and you wanting to steal it for your child.", "YTA.  There's nothing wrong with encouraging the boy to share with his little sister but it should be his decision.  Mandating that a kid (17 is a kid) share what he bought with his own money sounds like you are spoiling the girl.\n\n& Your analogy is no good. You are the parent.", "YTA\n\nIf he was eating it in front of her, you would have a point.  But he wasn't.  He didn't even show it to her.  He's allowed to buy snacks for himself and himself alone.  And this isn't even uncommon behavior.  My fiance and I have shared finances, but we can buy our own \"private snacks\" if we want to.  \n\nYour daughter needs to learn to accept \"no\" for an answer and that she isn't always going to get what she wants.  This was a great learning opportunity for that, especially as she went through his bags to find the candy.  Instead, you taught her that if she goes through other people's things, finds something she wants, and throws a fit, she'll get her way.  The fact that an 8 year old is carrying on loud enough to wake a baby over some candy should have been a clear and obvious sign that you had some parenting to do and instead you chose to reinforce her bad behavior.  So YTA a second time for not parenting your kid.", "YTA. When it boils down to it, All you did was reinforce crappy behavior from your daughter by teaching her its ok to throw a fit until mom gives her what she wants\n\nAll you taught step son was that you're 100% willing to trample all over him and his hard earned things as long as it means *you* get to avoid dealing with frustrating and inconvenient parenting because your daughters screeching woke up your other teething kid.\n\nBad parenting move and your husband was 100% correct for checking you for how you are treating his son.", "YTA - His money, his candy, his decision.  Forcing him to share with your daughter is a violation of his space.  You can encourage him to share.  That is good manners.  Forcing him to share makes you TA.", "Yta. You don\u2019t get to demand that someone shares something- if they want to offer then that is up to them. I doubt you\u2019d tell a co-worker or friend that they are obligated to share something so why are you treating your stepson like his possessions don\u2019t matter?", "YTA it appears you were upset that the arguing woke up your baby and you took it out on your stepson. \n\nThis was a good opportunity for you to teach your daughter about responsibility/hard work and explain that since he worked for the Candy he did not have to share it. It would have taught her a lesson and gain your stepson respect. \n\nYou need to apologize to your stepson and explain you were wrong and over reacted because the arguing woke up the baby. \n\nYou need to tell your daughter you were wrong and maybe you guys could come up with some easy chore she could do to earn her own candy money\n\nThis is all on you to fix the problem you created \n\nPlease keep us updated", "YTA. You're parents, that's why you buy them food with your money.  He's a teenager,  he has no obligation to buy food for his sister.  (And by the way,  I have candy in my nightstand that I consider to be my candy and I don't share it with my children.  Even parents can have personal belongings)", "YTA.\n\nI swear I get so frustrated when my older relatives tell me about how their teenager is out of control, and I just have to sit there and bite my tongue while remembering every time they gave into a temper tantrum while I just watched. \n\nWhat did you teach your daughter here? That if she wines and complains enough, she gets what she wants? You can't teach a kid that and then act surprised when they become out of control later on in life. \n\nYour son didn't choose to have a kid to feed. You and your husband did. Thats why you legally are required to feed them. That's not the same.\n\nEdit: when I was a kid, my mom had the 'maybe next time' rule. It meant that if I was told I couldn't have something, I was supposed to respond 'maybe next time.' \n\nSometimes she'd get me the thing after that, other times she didn't, othertimes she waited until a holiday to surprise me with it. I once had an older lady offer to pay for a candy bar for me after hearing me say 'maybe next time' after being told no. I was actually around the same age as the daughter of OP when that happened, too. (Also yes my mom let her get it for me. I got a lot of praise in the car on the way home, while eating candy. Top 5 best memories for sure.)\n\nI firmly believe more kids need to be raised with the 'maybe next time' rule. Great way to not necessarily avoid tatrums, but to teach that tantrums arent going to get you what you want. Cause if I threw a fit, trust me, I was never EVER seeing whatever it was I was crying over. If I said 'maybe next time' there was a chance I'd get it either now or later. If I threw a tantrum, that basically made the answer 100% confirmed to be no, might as well never had asked.", "YTA - First of all, he is right, it's his money and he does not have to share.\n\nSecondly:\n\n> I told him that we buy most of our groceries with his dad's and my money so we could use the same logic,\n\nYou do realize you are wrong here right? A parent not feeding their children is not the same as a kid not sharing snacks they bought.\n\nFinally:\n\n>She came crying to me (waking up my youngest son, who's teething btw)\n\nHow is this relevant? This is due to your own crappy parenting where your daughter could not accept no as an answer. \n\nYou are the evil stepmother kids worry about getting.", "YTA\n\nSo, your daughter threw a tantrum and you bullied your stepson into giving her his candy because you couldn't be bothered to parent her. Not a good look.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou have a **LEGAL AND MORAL** obligation to feed him. He is 17 and a minor child.  His snack are bought with money he earned, and he has no obligation to share.", "Yta 1000% buy your kid snack and stop being an idiot. If you think she is entitled to his snacks, you are WRONG!!", "YTA It isn't his responsibility to feed your daughter snacks. Not sure why you mentioned the teething baby, so let me just be clear, it also isn't his responsibility to help with the baby either.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou and your daughter owe your son a bag of chips. And an apology.", "YTA - He bought those snacks with his earnings.\n\nbtw why does the title say he bought the snacks with candy?", "YTA.\n\nIt doesn't matter your baby is teething. It was the 8 yr olds fault for waking them. Step son told her NO. He can do what he wants with his money. Your argument saying you share the grocery you buy. No, you don't share. You provide food and shelter for your family. If you bought something special and told them they can't have any, it is just as acceptable as SS saying NO to his sister. \n\nI wonder what will happen when he turns 18 and what logic you will use to want to kick him out.", "YTA. He's working for extras and then you throw basic parenting costs in his face? You need to teach your child not to come crying to you every time she doesn't get what she wants. Your favoritism and poor parenting stinks here.", "yta... his spending money. If he chooses to share, then he can. If he says no, then NO. You just didn't want to have to deal with a crying kid.", "YTA. Your example isn't a reasonable comparison, either. Your stepson is a minor, so you and your husband are legally obligated to provide his basic needs, including food. He doesn't have the same obligation to your daughter. If she wants snacks then it's your responsibility to provide them. He should get to use the money he earns as he likes. It's not his fault your daughter woke up that baby. It sounds like you were taking your frustrations out on him. It also sounds like your daughter needs to learn to accept no when someone doesn't want to share their things with her.", "YTA. \n\nStepson is 17 and it\u2019s your husband\u2019s responsibility (and yours, by default) to provide for him while he\u2019s a minor. So your logic of \u201cwe buy most of our groceries with his dads and my money bla bla bla\u201d is a moot point because no you cannot. \n\nTeach your daughter not to be entitled instead of punishing your stepson for working hard and starting to provide for himself.", "YTA. Parents are supposed to provide for their kids so your argument is a false equivalency . It would have been better for you to use this as a lesson for your younger kids. He's just going to start hiding his snacks.", "YTA. Food purchased with his own money belongs to him. He decides when/if to share. You, as the parent, are required to provide food for your children.", "You have a teething baby and a kid throwing a fit because she didn't get her way. It was his. That would have been an important lesson for your daughter about boundaries and respecting the word no. Your daughter had no right to throw a fit to you, but did so because she thinks she can get what she wants. It wasn't hers or yours. Once she had asked him and he said no it should have been respected.", "YTA. \n\nYou just taught your stepson and daughter two different, but both bad, lessons. \n\nYour daughter just learned throwing a fit works. She also learned that you will side with her against her half brother. She also doesn't have to respect his things. \n\nYou taught your son that his hard work means nothing. Yeah, you guys buy most his food, but your the parents. It's literally your job to feed all your kids. It's not his job to feed his half sister candy.", "YTA  I guess you want to play the role of an evil stepmother. Way to lean in to a stereotype.  It's his money to do what he wants with.  What does it matter if the food in the house is paid for by someone else??  That's par for the course if you have a child till they are at least 18!  \n\nTry not to be a stepbitch next time.", "YTA. What's the point of him working and trying for independence if you can take what he earns and give it to his little sister? And then when he objects, you ground him. \n\nYou choose to have your son with all the requrements of feeding and sheltering him, he didn't choose to have his sister so your analogy is moot. \n\nIt is dangerous to make things like shelter and food a way of controlling people. You've just given him a big incentive to move out because you are weaponising the things he is entitled to as a minor to force him to do things he doesn't want to or need to.", "INFO\n\n> the snacks he brought with his own candy \n\n... wat?\n\nHe's *trading* candy *for* other snacks?", "YTA", "YTA.

He's bought that out of his money. Your argument about buying groceries is a false equivalency as you have a responsibility to provide for minor children in your household as their parents. He has no such responsibility. It's up to him whether he shares or not. You threatening to ground him was so out of order. You should have respected his no and redirected your daughter to snacks she could have.", "YTA, your daughter is old enough to understand a NO. That's enough. He had every right to not give it. You could have offered him the money just to save yourself some drama in that moment. But the problem is with your daughter and your enabling behaviour because you just showed her she can have anything if she complains loud enough, a 8 year old! even her brothers snacks he earned with his own money. He is still underaged, so technically you and your husband are responsible to buy groceries for him anyway, it is your duty of care, so it is inapropriate to use it as a bargaining chip when he bought something exclusively for himself with money he earned. Quite Shameless. You need to buy him replacement and ideally with your daughter's pocket money. You need to teach her respect to others.", "YTA, but you already know that.

We have a eight years old daughter together and a baby (7months) \n\nMy step son got a part time job around Christmas, he works in Starbucks. He's using his money to buy mostly gaming equipment, games and clothes, but sometimes he also buys snacks. They're not special snacks or anything, just Doritos or chips from the store. He likes to have some bags to eat while he's playing. \n\nHe brought a big pack of stuff yesterday after work, when he came home my daughter asked him what he brought and started looking though the stuff, he had some candy and she asked for some. He told her those candies were his and told her to not touch it, she insisted on having some and as he said no again they started arguing and she then cried. \n\nShe came crying to me (waking up my youngest son, who's teething btw) and told me what happened. So I told my son to just share some candy with her and help. He argued that he brought it with his own money so he doesn't have to give her anything. I told him that we buy most of our groceries with his dad's and my money so we could use the same logic, he continued arguing until I threatened him to ground him and he finally gave in. He was upset afterwards.\n\nWhen my husband came home he told him what happened and after dinner my husband called mw off for treating step son as a little kid, he said that since he's being responsible with a job and getting his own money then he should get to decide if he wants to share his snacks or not and told me to not get my frustration out on his son.

Buy your daughter her own shit with your own money", "YTA. A minor who works has no legal obligation to buy for a household. It was his. You basically stole from him to appease your entitled brat who cried and caused a scene because she couldn't get what she wants.You never taught her to earn anything,just to expect everything she wants to be handed to her. I hope he cuts ties with you once he moves out because you obviously do not have his best interests at heart.", "YTA... it is his money.  It is not his responsibility to provide snacks for your children.  Do better.  Stop buying food/providing for him and see how that works out.  When you are in jail you can reflect on your behavior.", "YTA. But thank you to teach us who are not parents yet how to NOT parent.", "YTA well done you have just proven to your daughter that if she cries to mummy she\u2019ll get her own way. He paid for that with his money. Don\u2019t start in on the whole \u201cwe buy your groceries\u201d thing - that is your legal responsibility as a parent!", "YTA.", "YTA.\n\nYour baby teething detail didn\u2019t add anything, by the way.  Only to show you\u2019re focused on your own world, and you\u2019re totally unaware of how you\u2019re isolating your stepson.", "YTA. You and your husband have a legal obligation to provide your children with food. Your stepson has no such obligation to your other children. You basically stole his candy because your daughter cried, teaching her she can take anything from anyone if she cries to you about it. Then, when he rightfully called you out, you threatened to ground a near-adult for wanting his possessions respected. Terrible parenting all around.", "YTA. People are allowed to not share things that belong to them, regardless of whose money purchased the thing. If you had gifted the candy to your stepson and then made him give it to your daughter after he said no, you\u2019d still be the AH because it was his candy. \n\nYoung children should learn that not everything belongs to them and to respect people\u2019s boundaries. You are raising your daughter to be entitled and rude.", "YTA \n\nBeing exhausted with a teething baby is the worst. But (harsh reality check) you don\u2019t get a free pass to not parent anyone else. \n\nShe\u2019s allowed to be bummed. She\u2019s allowed to be jealous. Those are age appropriate responses. She\u2019s not allowed to demand. He\u2019s allowed to be upset that someone is demanding his stuff. That\u2019s a normal response. But you are the parent. And when your daughter created a mountain out of a molehill, it was your job to diffuse the situation. \n\nThe quickest way to build resentment between siblings is to let stuff like this go on. It\u2019s your job to teach them compassion and kindness towards one another. Instead you essentially told your stepson that his possessions that he worked for are not his. You showed your daughter that if she screams loud enough she\u2019ll get whatever she wants.", "YTA. Why is it your 17 year old's responsibility to give her snacks? There are easy solutions here. Your daughter should be old enough to understand that she's not entitled to things other people buy for themselves. So explain that to her and give your son a little extra money to buy extra snacks next time he goes out for them. Problem solved.", "YTA\n\nStop spoiling your daughter at the expense of your stepson.", "Yta", "YTA. \n\nWhy are you giving in when your daughter threw a temper tantrum? \n\nYour SS bought it with HIS OWN money. It\u2019s his. No one else\u2019s. He shouldn\u2019t have to share.", "YTA for rewarding your 8 year old for her demanding tantrum and waking the baby, your stepson done nothing wrong. Would it have been nice to share, sure but he didn't want to and I can just imagine the way your daughter approached the situation would have made me say no to her.\n\nI get it, you have a baby and it woke up probably stressing you, I get you tried for easy option but you fucked up. Apologies are in order from you and your daughter to your stepson/son. Also use this as a moment to teach your daughter.", "Yes you can have the same logic with everything you provide to your kids. And you probably did at some point in their lives, buying something for you and you didn't want to share because its yours. The difference is that your kids are your responsibility, you are their caregiver, their guardian etc. \n\nOn the other hand, your 8yo daughter is not his responsibility. The best action you should have done is tell your daughter that you will go with her to the store the buy her some candy when you can. \n\nYTA because it's his money and he can spend it and share his items how he wants.", "YTA", "Yep, YTA.\n\nYou have a legal obligation to give your children food.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a legal obligation to share his property.\n\nTeach your daughter not to be entitled.", "YTA", "YTA you told him that you and his father pay for the groceries?! Uh\u2026 you mean like how your legally responsible to food, cloth and house a minor?! Even if you didn\u2019t say that it would still be an ah move. He may not have been being nice but your daughter needs to hear no it sounds like.", "Absolutely YTA. Those are not the same situation at all. You have a duty of care to provide for your stepson, but he is not obligated to care for his sister. If you want her to have snacks, you should be buying them or at the very least reimbursing him.", "YTA. He worked and used his own money. If you want to get candy for your daughter, then you go buy some yourself. Listen to your husband. He\u2019s right.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t even matter that he\u2019s the step son.  If they were full blood siblings the answer would be the same. Do not teach your kids that they\u2019re entitled to other ppl\u2019s belongings. Sheesh. She also should have been punished for pulling the crying once she was told no.", "YTA. and your whole \"logic\" about you paying for his food so it's technically yours? YOU ARE THE PARENT. it's your job to provide for him. throwing that in his face is just bad parenting.", "No wonder your daughter such a brat, she learned it from you.

Because she whined to her mom about it? Good grief. The child you should have been parenting in this situation is the whiny 8 year old who wants what\u2019s not hers and doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. \nYou clearly don\u2019t believe he is of equal importance in your house as your bio kids if you\u2019d threaten the \u201cwe buy the rest of the food\u201d business.", "YTA, congratulations.

You just showed your poor parenting skills and self nominated yourself for the evil stepmother award all at once. YTA.", "YTA and a crappy parent in this situation.", "YTA. For forcing your step son to share something he bought with is sister, not holding your daughter accountable for her bratty behavior, and conflating your legal requirement to not starve your children and your step son not wanting to share his possessions.", "YTA favorite spoiled child much?", "Obviously YTA. Stop being the evil stepmother. The kid bought the snacks with his own money and because your spoiled brat of a daughter cried she got her way. You need to fix this by apologizing and replacing whatever snacks she took plus bonus.", "YTA", "YTA. No you can\u2019t use the same logic your step son is under 18 and you married his father knowing he existed legally his father is obligated to provide food and shelter for him until he\u2019s 18. When he turns 18 it\u2019s up to his father NOT YOU if that system continues. Your daughter needs to learn that some things are not hers and not cry about it. Your teaching her to be a brat. This isn\u2019t the end of the world but You owe your stepson an apology.", "YTA - he's being responsible by getting a job and buying stuff with his own money. If he decided on his own to give him some of her sweets then that's different but your telling him to share what he bought with his sister like a child and when she says no your forcing him to hand it over just because she crying she can't have it.  Your not only making him resent you but also teaching your daughter that if she cries and throws a tantrum you'll eventually give up and let her do and get what she wants", "Yta. What I don\u2019t understand is if you know your daughter likes candy then why don\u2019t you keep any in the house for her?. Also what point were you trying to make by saying that you feed him groceries that is bought with HIS fathers money?. A parent should be responsible and feeding their own child, honestly grow tf up.", "YTA.  Your 8yo should know better than have a tantrum over someone else's belongings.  You gave into  this so expect more.  You have a legal obligation to feed your step son.  He doesn't have one to give your child his snacks.  Don't compare the two.  I had a stepfather like you.  Had being the main word there.  Mom wised up and got rid of him.", "YTA\n\nHis money, his stuff", "What you could have offered - not threatened - is to replace any candy he gives your daughter IF he chooses to share. \n\nKind of the asshole here.", "Definitely TA. Why do you get to decide what he does with his things? He has zero responsibility to provide snacks for your daughter; you, however, do.", "I\u2019m really in awe how often this storyline is regurgitated; that people think it\u2019s okay?

AITA?\n\nFull quote as I expect this to get deleted.\n\nYTA no question. He's not a 3rd parent he's a kid that works. His money is his money. You could have used this as an opportunity to teach your little kid about finances.The idea that you can work for things you want, that all you can do is ask for something someone else has. Why are you intentionally raising a terror!? Screaming means you get whatever you want and if people don't give it to you they are wrong! \n\nApologize to your stepson if you want to ever have a relationship with him. Say you were way off base, and overwhelmed by the compounded screaming and handled it poorly. Take the opportunity to step up your own personal responsibility and show your kids that adults can be wrong. Fix it", "YTA those are his snacks that he paid for.

We all make mistakes in parenting, but recognizing when we\u2019ve made a mistake and working to try to repair any harm we\u2019ve caused is our responsibility as parents. She\u2019s not taking responsibility for her actions here.\nEdit: and I doubt she\u2019d feel so sure about her actions if the 17 year old were her biological child.", "Same. My 9 and 8 year old know that they do not have to share their snacks and that tantrums get them nowhere. When we go to the grocery store they are each allowed to pick any snack/ food so there are zero excuses to want something the other has.", "Our money", "this is the biggest thing honestly. No matter how good people can be in general they are capable of being the biggest jackasses in town if they are pushed enough. The best thing you can do in life is to keep the level of asholery down (even if you think you are 100% right at the time don't go over the top) and be willing to apologize when you fuck up.", "But this is probably not the first time he\u2019s been forced to give up something to his sister, yeah?", "Still doesn't make the 17 year old responsible for keep the 8 y/o from throwing a tantrum because she was told NO! She is 8! Not 3, Not 5. The same way she went off on the 17 year old child who did nothing wrong. Should could have told the 8 y/o No & to stop. But she didn't, she instead went off on the child that isn't hers & told him he owed them for caring for him, her husband's minor child. She is the AH tired or not. And the fact that she can't see it shows it wasn't about the baby waking up. It was about her resentment for the 17 year old. She is a raging AH.", "> so I think she resents that she's covering some of his living expenses\n\nYou're reading way too much into this. she wanted the 17 year old to share so her  8 year old would stop whining and she & the baby could go back to sleep.   Has nothing to do with resentment.", "After 10 minutes of trying literally anything to redirect his attention from a tantrum over anything I get to a point I just walk off and act like he\u2019s not there until he stops \ud83e\udd23 act a fool buddy. I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re done. \n\nThe only people I\u2019ve seen him throw a tantrum at not sharing candy is me and his dad. But again, he\u2019s only a little over 2.5. Anyone else and he\u2019s like fine whatever f u and walks away", "Good job. She is only three. She will get there. It must have been really scary to have a preemie and have to worry about Covid. I hope you have a way to process that. I would find ways to encourage her to share and do kind things with others. Always praise her when she is kind and shares. \n\nMy son is an adult and when he was three we had a coworker\u2019s child over for a play date. My son was the sweetest little boy. He hit the child who came over with a shovel when he got in his Little Tyke\u2019s car. I was mortified. Fortunately it was a child\u2019s shovel but still awful. \n\nMy daughter on the other hand who came when my son was four was always awful at sharing when she was young. She went postal at three at a birthday party and threw the birthday girl\u2019s doll in the dirt. So many of my memories with her at that age were packing her up and leaving places as she went into full brat mode.\n\nI think preschool and daycare is great for kids. They learn so much from other children and are often more receptive to reprimands and guidance from teachers than parents.\n\nParenting is a journey.:)", "It\u2019s developmentally normal behaviour for a 3 year old, and typically a phase so long as parents don\u2019t give in to everything. Having a 3 year old who behaves this way isn\u2019t a negative reflection on your parenting at all, and it sounds like you\u2019re using these moments to help her learn. If she still frequently feels entitled to everything she wants at 8, then you can worry about your parenting. You\u2019re doing good.", "3 year olds struggle to share and still wholly self centred. It\u2019s not a character flaw, presumably just an evolutionary survival instinct. By 4 they\u2019re much better and at 5 they understand reciprocity and sharing are a required part of friendships. You kid will get there; most of us do.", "Say \u201cno\u201d to *my* child? YOU\u2019RE GROUNDED!

Cold day in HELL they'd ever pull that shit.", "It was scary especially after a traumatic delivery but we got through it. Her bubble was very small for the first year and only slightly expanded until she was 2. The last 6 months or so we're opening it up more and taking her in public more to try to prepare for school since her immune system should be more deceleration by now.  \n\nMy son was awful at sharing.  He still is some days at 11. Most of the time the 2 yo will share if we ask and is very sweet but if she wants a toy that brother is playing with she doesn't take no well so we're starting to work on it.", "And it's your fault that she woke up the baby with her tantrum.", "YTA.  \nThat's exactly how you breed an undeserved sense of entitlement in a child (your daughter). Don't act surprised when your precious little daughter ends up as a full-blown narcissist.  \nPlus you are not respecting your step-son's boundaries.", "you threatened to ground a 17 year old for buying things with his own money & \"not sharing\", then tried to use \"his logic\" against him, because you & his father keep him alive with food? like you're supposed to? jesus. YTA.", "YTA! He bought something for himself with his own money and it\u2019s a big deal for someone his age. Let him enjoy his hard earned money.

Do you think that\u2019s right? Why or why not? Not saying he should have shared necessarily, but it was an opportunity to help him think through his motives and wrong vs right and become more self aware. \n\nIt was a teachable moment for both kids and you missed the opportunity.", "Nope, you were deadass wrong, OP. YTA! Your step son set a boundary and you completely squashed it. You didn\u2019t like that he told you no and your kid no, so you used manipulation and punishment to get your way instead of teaching your daughter that boundaries are expected to be respected and that no means no!", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re a good example as to why people should have a licence to produce children!", "You threatened to starve a child you are legally responsible for and you say you're not sure if you're an asshole? Some people never should become parents. YTA", "Totally agree with this (as a step mum myself) ruling, YTA. \n\nWould not have been, if you\u2019d offered to reimburse/ replace shared snacks.", "If you care about your stepson you could encourage him to be generous (but it must be his choice, not an obligation). Reimburse him - and extra.", "lol good point! And also, am I the only one who thinks it's not cool to ground 17 year old step kids? (Or any kids?)", "It's proof husband was right to accuse her of taking frustrations out on their son.", "This is EXACTLY what caught my attention.

I highly doubt she just learned that. \n\nShe knew before this incident that crying to mom would mean getting her way and that no means \u2026. more badgering and harassing is needed to get that yes.", "I'm honestly baffled how far down this was. It's like reddit is full of teenagers who have the idea that it's their money, and therefore their choice.\n\nYea, on all accounts of technicality, it's his right to share or not share. But seriously, a 17 yr old is almost old enough to vote. It's family! Why wouldn't he just be a good older brother and share with a kid. It's candy for crying out loud, not some expensive gadget that could get broken. I would expect him to share something like that with practically anyone, whether it's friends, family, or even practical strangers.\n\nEven if it was like a 12 yr old mowing lawns for hard earned money and buying their own candy, I would, as a parent, expect my son to share with a younger sibling (step or not) cause it's kind and generous and the type of person I want to raise. It's fully within the rights of the parent to teach their kids good manners and generosity.\n\nNo, it's totally within your rights to do as you want with your own money, but you can still be an AH about it. And people jumping to conclusion that the little kid is spoiled...com'on, seriously? From a single instance of a little kid digging around and finding something they want? Obviously no one that said that has any clue what raising a kid is like. Yea, it's a lesson to teach your kid not to be nosy in other people's stuff but to jump to the conclusion that they're spoiled from this single instance is absurd. I'd love to see who grew up and not once, asked for something that an adult would know it's rude to ask for.", "I\u2019m not sure if I personally would call the 17 yr old a full AH because yes, he doesn\u2019t have an obligation to share since he bought it with his own money, and I get that sometimes you just don\u2019t want to share lol (especially if your annoying little sister goes crying to mommy about it). Also a lot of the Y T A comments do make good points about spoiling the sister or how mom\u2019s logic was flawed. That all said, I have to agree with you as well\u2026 it\u2019s candy ffs. He can\u2019t give her a piece to keep her happy while his mom is busy with a baby? Is this the hill he really wants to die on? I also have a younger sibling who used to annoy me to no end when they were younger but I still knew how to share things that were technically 100% mine. And I honestly can\u2019t remember the last time I bought snacks and didn\u2019t buy them with the intention, or at least the assumption, that they would be shared when I bring them into the house in full view (considering they are a shareable size).", "I was looking for this comment! Thank you! I grew up with several siblings and we were already taught to share. No matter who bought what you share with your siblings.", "Yup.

There\u2019s just over 2 years between them and I\u2019ve said it about sharing and also just not wanting to play.", "It\u2019s ok to expect a 17 year old to buy his own special snacks. It doesn\u2019t mean that the parents don\u2019t buy snacks for the household, including him, just that he wants a few bags of Doritos etc a week while gaming and he can buy that for himself. He\u2019s approaching adulthood quickly and it\u2019s good he\u2019s learned that it\u2019s his responsibility to buy extra things he wants himself, while having all the basics covered. He doesn\u2019t have to share though. He worked for that money and his sister is not his child to care for. He\u2019s taking on age appropriate responsibility by working to pay for his games and extra snacks, but expecting him to take responsibility for his sister\u2019s wants is definitely not an appropriate expectation. Would it be nice if he shared? Sure. Is he also entitled to have some things that are just his (especially because he worked for them, but also in general)? Absolutely. He had every right to say no, and stepmom was wrong. It\u2019s not really appropriate to expect the parents of a 17 year old to buy extra (expensive) treats for him, but it is their responsibility to keep him fed in general.", "Or they (orig mom and husband) have saved x for their son\u2019s college but the younger kids need it so is it fair to give the kids a split amount.", "Yes!!! My grandparents did this during my bday with my younger brother. I never got gifts on his bday, but they always got him something for my bc he would cry he didnt have a present, too. Now, guess who is in jail for robbing his own parents bc he thought he felt entitled to their things?

I would *not* allow them to have at it because it makes my life a bit easier.  I don't think it would make my kid bratty though.  Kids pull a lot of crap - they try things on all the time.  That doesn't make them inherently bad.  Impulsive sure, to greater or lesser degrees but I feel bratty is harsh.", "This right here. I was looking for this. Its here everyone, the tell.
