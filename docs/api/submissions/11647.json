I worked a full-time job and help pay the rent, and I'm planning on getting an apartment soon. I also had a girlfriend (21f) named Kara a year ago. It mostly started as a one-time stand but I started truly loving her, and we barely used protection so it didn't help that she eventually got pregnant. I offered to help her pay for her abortion, but she said she didn't want one and eventually gave birth to our son. I didn't want anything to do with my son since it was my ex's choice to have the baby. But lately my dad has been extremely verbally abusive to me, saying I should take care of my son and that I'm a waste of a man if I don't help out with my kid. It led me into a deep depression and I was unable to do anything at all. I quit my job and just sulked around drinking all day.\n\nI hated my son. I resented him and Kara for possibly ruining my life. I didn't want to pay anything for my son, but my dad forced me to or else he'd kick me out. My dad was happy to be a grandfather; he wants to support Kara and has a good relationship with Kara's parents. Kara's parents want nothing to do with me, nor does my ex. I never wanted custody, so I don't have custody of my kid, so what's the problem? Why is my dad trying to force me to support my kid? I don't know, but recently he's been extremely hostile to me.\n\nSo what happened was that Kara called me hesitantly asking where my dad was since he didn't pick up his phone (he was out grilling with friends) and I told her where he was, she immediately hung out and I saw red. I texted her saying she ruined my life and turned my own father against me, and that she's evil and manipulative. It doesn't help that I was also kind of drunk, so I kind of regret what I said. She told on her parents AND my dad about what he said, and my dad said she was crying when she got the text, which I don't believe because she hated me anyway.\n\nMy dad banged on my door and called me a fucking cunt and a disgrace of a son, and that he could not believe he raised such a piece of shit. I ended up crying myself asking him why he's hurting his own son, and then he asked \"I'm not abusing you, but you are abusing Kara\" and told me to get my shit together, get a job, or else he is going to disown me and throw me to the streets. I had a mental breakdown that night and didn't know what to do.\n\nWas I an asshole for everything?", "created_utc": 1678125137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k743d/aita_for_nearly_being_disowned_by_my_dad/", "score": 432, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

TWO! That means that OP is not the only person that should take responsibility.\n\n2- I get the \"my body, my choice\" that women have. But something I don't get is why are we allowing women to decide if they want to have a child, but when a man decides he's not ready to be a father, everybody is coming down his throat. To me, OP was clear when he suggested abortion to his ex: he did not want the child. Yet, the ex decided \"Oh well, I don't want an abortion (I get it, it's not easy), I'm keeping the baby.\" And OP has to suck it up and step up even though he was clear from the start ?\n\n3- OP's father pushing his son to step up because he wants to be a grandfather. I feel like OP's dad really created that tense relationship and atmosphere. His son is clearly not ready to be a father and has expressed so, yet he kept pushing the matter down his son's throat.\n\nTo me, it is a case of ESH:\n\n- OP: resenting the child is not going to help whatsoever.\n\n- OP's ex: for being upset with OP not stepping up when she knew he did not want to be a father.\n\n- OP's father: for not respecting his son's choice of not wanting to be a father and pushing the matter.\n\nNow, was the ex wrong for having the baby? No. Would it be nice if OP was opened to step up in the child's life? Yes. Would it be the right thing to do? Probably not, he's clearly not interested in participating in this child's life. Should he take responsibility by paying child support? Certainly. But forcing OP into a role he does not want is not the right way.\n\nEdit: People are blaming OP because he did not use protection. But we don't know the full picture. Did the girlfriend had anything against it? Was it a common decision?", "I couldn't believe it when i read it.
