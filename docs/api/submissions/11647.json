I worked a full-time job and help pay the rent, and I'm planning on getting an apartment soon. I also had a girlfriend (21f) named Kara a year ago. It mostly started as a one-time stand but I started truly loving her, and we barely used protection so it didn't help that she eventually got pregnant. I offered to help her pay for her abortion, but she said she didn't want one and eventually gave birth to our son. I didn't want anything to do with my son since it was my ex's choice to have the baby. But lately my dad has been extremely verbally abusive to me, saying I should take care of my son and that I'm a waste of a man if I don't help out with my kid. It led me into a deep depression and I was unable to do anything at all. I quit my job and just sulked around drinking all day.\n\nI hated my son. I resented him and Kara for possibly ruining my life. I didn't want to pay anything for my son, but my dad forced me to or else he'd kick me out. My dad was happy to be a grandfather; he wants to support Kara and has a good relationship with Kara's parents. Kara's parents want nothing to do with me, nor does my ex. I never wanted custody, so I don't have custody of my kid, so what's the problem? Why is my dad trying to force me to support my kid? I don't know, but recently he's been extremely hostile to me.\n\nSo what happened was that Kara called me hesitantly asking where my dad was since he didn't pick up his phone (he was out grilling with friends) and I told her where he was, she immediately hung out and I saw red. I texted her saying she ruined my life and turned my own father against me, and that she's evil and manipulative. It doesn't help that I was also kind of drunk, so I kind of regret what I said. She told on her parents AND my dad about what he said, and my dad said she was crying when she got the text, which I don't believe because she hated me anyway.\n\nMy dad banged on my door and called me a fucking cunt and a disgrace of a son, and that he could not believe he raised such a piece of shit. I ended up crying myself asking him why he's hurting his own son, and then he asked \"I'm not abusing you, but you are abusing Kara\" and told me to get my shit together, get a job, or else he is going to disown me and throw me to the streets. I had a mental breakdown that night and didn't know what to do.\n\nWas I an asshole for everything?", "created_utc": 1678125137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k743d/aita_for_nearly_being_disowned_by_my_dad/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had an equal part in creating that child, you have an equal part in paying for the cost of turning that child into an adult... welcome to adulthood. Get your shit together - it's not your son's fault that you didn't want him born and he certainly does not deserve to constantly hear that for his whole life and deal with the resulting trauma, resentment, etc. You think your dad is \"hurting his own son\"? Imagine how your kid will feel 10-15 years from now when they've spent their entire life knowing their father 1) didn't want them/wanted them aborted and further 2) RESENTS their whole existence.

Choosing to become and alcholic and quit your job is an asshole move but so is everyone else here. You would have been paying child support if they had just kept you out of it.

You know feeling crappy about yourself doesn't = a mental breakdown right? Man up, dry out, get a job support the kid because you didn't wear a condom. \n\nThat's it.

All of your beef is with your dad (who, for the record, is only guilty of *checks notes* loving his grandchild??

This should be \"AITA for yelling at a single mom about my own daddy issues\"", " YTA: literally all of this is your own fault. You don\u2019t want a baby? Wear a condom, get a vasectomy, or stop having sex with women who aren\u2019t on birth control. I mean, accidents happen but this wasn\u2019t an accident. It was the entirely predictable result of your own actions. \n\nDid the two of you even talk about what you would do if she got pregnant while you were having this relationship? \n\nYou ruined your own life.

But don\u2019t blame the kid for this, ain\u2019t his fault.\n\nKara didn\u2019t want an abortion. That\u2019s her right. But I also think it\u2019s your right to not what to be in the kids life. And that\u2019s ok! My only advice to you is move out, your dad isn\u2019t good for you. And get some therapy to help with the depression you are feeling.\n\nGood luck, OP.

I went for the \u201copt out\u201d option when I was in Kara\u2019s position many years ago. No regrets on my end because \u201cthe father\u201d was in no place to support anyone. Lived with his folks, had a part time job, no real aspirations or career prospects, etc and I wasn\u2019t much better back then. I let him know over text when he didn\u2019t return my calls, he asked if I was serious, I said yea- then was ghosted. Didn\u2019t hear from him for 3 years until he figured he\u2019d check to see if he had a child because he was lonely- not because he cared. Because I would have been a turn key family for him. Some people really are that clueless. \n\nFor the record and before anyone wants to argue about my morals/ ethics: I fully acknowledge getting pregnant was my fault as well as his we didn\u2019t discuss it happening prior.
