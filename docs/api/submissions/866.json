Jack and Luke aren't close mostly due to this, but their relationship is getting better (or I thought).\n\nSara recently passed away in a crash. Our entire family is reeling from this. The funeral is coming up and our family are all attending, Zoe was invited along with her boyfriend. Jack said that I can \"only come if I don't bring Luke\". I asked why, he said I know why and Sara wouldn't want Luke there. I was pretty surprised at that and said if that's the case maybe it's better if I don't go as well. Jack really blew up (which I do understand because he's dealing with a lot of grief) and said we never cared about either of them.\n\nMy parents agreed that it wasn't really fair that Luke isn't coming, and Zoe said it's not our choice and I'd be an ass if I don't go to support Jack.

You husband is now part of your family so that means your brother is keeping you away from your husband during a time where you would be mourning over someone you have gotten a relationship with due to the connection with your brother. So your brother is an asshole but also not as much as people will make them out to be. He is grieving. I would also understand more if the deceased fianc\u00e9's family was organising and paying for the funeral.\n\nHowever, you would be the asshole if you don't support you brother at all. This is going to be a very hard time for him because of loosing his fianc\u00e9 so in a hole he does need his sister there to support him. If your partner is fine with you going alone, that is fine. It would most likely be hard and all but being there to support your brother is something that he will remember for a long time. He would remember it negatively if you did not support him by being there for him. \n\nSo overall, my judgment is you and your brother are asshole.", "YTA - the day isn\u2019t a couples date\u2026 does your husband even want to attend?\u2026 my guess is they\u2019d be fine skipping it and you pulled this petty move out of revenge more than anything.

Sure I was hurt that I couldn't go BUT that's what they wanted. Go without your husband for one day. Yes, I agree it sucks that Jack is excluding your husband and is being an a-hole too.

The rest of the family can support him at the funeral", "I think it\u2019s weird that people are being \u201cinvited\u201d to a funeral .... or in this case not invited.

Smart, confident women don\u2019t try to actively break people\u2019s relationships, take no for an answer, and don\u2019t lie and gaslight people into depression!

How many times do you expect your brother's fiancee to die? \n\nEvery thing you comment convinces me further that YTA. Your husband is *kind of pissed* he can't go to the funeral of a woman who didn't like him, and whose relationship his sister, who he supported, tried to destroy? What? Why would he even want to go?", "Your husband supported the villain in a plot against your brother and his now dead fiance. It seems YOUR HUSBAND was in the wrong for doing so.\n\nIf you so doggedly believe in the need to support siblings in their struggles that you excuse your husband's culpability while doing so, why are you so reluctant to support YOUR sibling?", "Info: How did you end up dating a man who, along with his family, caused your brother and the woman he cared about a great deal of pain?\n\nAlso, why did you assume everyone had \u201cgotten over it\u201d?

He supported his sister in trying to break up a happy couple because she went on one date with your brother before the relationship started?\n\nYTA.", "> I just don't want this to become a recurring thing with Jack that he excludes Luke\n\nOh, I don't think you have to worry about that because I doubt your brother will want to see either of you after this.

He shouldn't have supported his sister's creepiness in the first place. He was supporting his sister harassing and sabotaging your brother's love life because she felt like she was entitled to him no matter what he wanted. She kept tabs on him AFTER ONE DATE and harassed his girlfriend too. That's what stalkers do. If I were your brother, I would've felt so incredibly betrayed when you started dating his stalker's brother. What kind of sister does that?", "Info: Is he pissed because he's also grieving the loss of Sara in some way and wants to be there for his own process, or simply because he's not allowed to an event?", "He supported his sister, a woman who tried to break up your brother's relationship with Sara using lies and accusations. He supported a woman whose lies almost tore the two apart and gave Sara depression. He supported a woman who hasn't taken ownership or this or apologised from the sounds of things. And you seem to support this too.\n\nNot really a wonder he wasn't invited. Did supporting his sister jnvolve condoning and supporting her behaviour too?

Honestly.....if the drama was between Sara & Luke's **sister**  then dang skippy get over it.

Maybe I didn't phrase it well, but I meant recurring as in excluding him from anything else in the future, where everyone else's SOs are invited but not mine", "Again... not about OP or husband. People attend funerals out of respect for the family & to acknowledge a fianc\u00e9, daughter, sister, cousin, aunt, has passed & will be terribly missed by the people who knew & loved her. It\u2019s not an act of betrayal to attend a funeral without your husband who was not a fan of Sara & who is not welcome. It\u2019s a sign of respect. Why would OP\u2019s husband want to go?!? This is more about the optics for OP & less about a woman has died & her brother is grieving.", "Luke\u2019s *sister*. Wow. Dumb Luke for being born into a family w a sister who couldn\u2019t handle a break up in the most mature Reddit way.", "Should be the top comment tbh", "Luke's sister caused Jack and Sara to break up by lying about Jack cheating.", "I posed the same question about Luke's feelings on the matter. This entire thing could be the plot of a bad soap.", "Or Luke defended his sisters actions in trying to ruin Jack and Sara\u2019s relationship.

Her funeral is not the time to deal with your family\u2019s drama.", "YTA. Why are you making someone else\u2019s funeral about you and your husband?\n\nThe purpose of a funeral is to (1) honor the dead (Sara) and (2) support the surviving loved ones (Jack and Sara\u2019s family) in grief.  Luke isn\u2019t invited because it wouldn\u2019t be honoring Sara (1). You\u2019re invited primarily to support Jack (2). You want to refuse to do (2) unless Jack and Sara\u2019s family don\u2019t do (1). \n\nHow does that make any sense when (as you said in a comment) your husband doesn\u2019t even care whether he goes? You\u2019re causing an enormous rift in your relationship with your brother and causing him additional pain for something about which your husband is apathetic. Unless you actually want to cause Jack additional pain or cause a rift, it makes no sense at all.", "Then address it in the future if it happens. It\u2019s not a stand to take *for a funeral.*", "Well if you don\u2019t go I guarantee you both not being invited to future events will be recurring.", "You chose to date and marry someone, who had already contributed to causing pain and anxiety for your brother.  Every action has consequences.  Your husband not being included is a reasonable consequence.  How did you imagine everything would play out?  Forgive and forget?", "Funerals aren't family get togethers. They're for grieving and remembering a specific person. This isn't a wedding where everyone gets a plus one but you, a woman that didn't like your husband has died. Show some compassion and have some class.", "This is a very specific scenario though. If Luke hasn\u2019t been excluded before this why would he be now for other things, besides the funeral? Sure Luke wanted to support his sister but his sister was the one in the wrong. Not Sara. I see no problem in what your brother is doing.", "I feel like this is a pretty unique circumstance? Why would this (hopefully) once in a lifetime situation be the one you make a stand on? \n\nAlso good god this isn't about your husband. It isn't about you. It is a funeral, it is about the deceased and their loved ones. That does not include your husband. Go and support your brother. Have some goddamn compassion", "Then maybe Luke shouldn\u2019t have supported his petty and crazy sister. Luke made the decision to back his sister trying to sabotage your brother\u2019s relationship, that comes with consequences no matter how much you think everyone has \u201cgotten over it.\u201d", "Don't have a shitty husband if you want him to be invited to events in the future.", "It will continue to happen until Luke cuts his sister off. She tried to break up their relationship by lying about him cheating, he shouldn\u2019t be expected to forgive that.", "Well, is the harassment of your brother a recurring thing? Is your boyfriend's sister still stalking him and sending her brother/ your boyfriend around to \"reason\" with him? Is your brother safe around these people? It doesn't sound to me like they would respect his grief, seeing they didn't respect the relationship in the first place.", "The family got involved though\n\u201cI don't know the nitty gritty details on this but she apparently went up to Sara and told her to leave him, and made it seem like she was cheating on Jack. Sara fell into depression and broke up with Jack, during that time Luke's family tried to talk it out with Jack (this is when I met Luke). Eventually Jack and Sara got back together later.\u201d", "Should be an edit and not a comment. That\u2019s why OP already knows YTA", "So you did!  I didn't see it.  Well, if I wrote it........it would be a good one.  ;0", "OP seems like she's either sugar coating what actually happened or she's clueless and Luke is a perv and hit on Sara or something", "For some reason I thought they meant the op. Didn't see that. Thought this was another case of aita commenters just inventing narratives.", "Interesting that OP\u2019s happy to clarify the private funeral thing, but not what Luke\u2019s sister did despite there being way more questions on that.  I\u2019m starting to suspect she already knows the answer doesn\u2019t help Luke\u2019s case in any way.", "I don't think we're going to get an answer though.", "She did [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk352f/wibta_if_i_dont_attend_my_brothers_fiancees/iur3b61/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) but it was only posted a couple minutes before your comment so you probably didn\u2019t see it", "I gave up and posted my vote & opinion.  \\*shrugs\\*  My husband is waving pancakes at me.", "Oh god that makes the whole thing so much worse....\n\nOP YTA! This is a funeral honoring the life of the person who passed, totally understandable why the family won't want anyone from your husband's family there"]}
