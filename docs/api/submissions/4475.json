Now, parents suggestion you just give it to your sibling, not cool. If you are selling it in the first place, it's for a reason. \n\nAnswering your original question, yes, you can ninja sell it if you want to, though you should be able to just tell them you'd rather sell it to someone who can pay upfront because the money would be useful right now. If anyone is offended by that, you have a completely different kind of problem with them", "NTA Tell them that you don't want to mix family/friends and money. You will be selling it to a stranger and that's the end of it. You want them to respect your position on this. Hassling you about it or trying to pressure you won't get them what they want -- it will just sour your relationship.", "NTA. Sell it and try to get full retail value out of it.  You're right about it often being better not to involve family in these sorts of transactions. \n\nYour parent is twisting your words and being unreasonable. It's not that you don't want the prize. It's that you prefer to have the money. Selling it is the only way to do so.", "NTA. It's your property, you can do what you want with it.

You shouldn't feel obligated to give them a cheaper price because you won it.  That your sibling is making this a big deal and escalating is rather controlling.  If your sibling really wants whatever this is, they can just buy it  on their own.\n\nNTA - tho perhaps a better approach might be sell it on the sly as you plan and then just say \"they were offering more money than you.  Offer I couldn't refuse\".    Whether thats true or not is not their business. \n\nAnother tack would be to sell it via ebay and your sibling or whomever can bid with everyone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust in general you are doing exactly as I would, selling the prize.   If I were ever on a game show like the Price is Right or whatever, I would just go ahead and sell the new car, the boat, the bedroom set.  If I could sell the trips I would do that.

You are obviously NTA (I'd say you are not only NTA, but you are the polar opposite of an AH for doing so).\n\nI'm sorry you are in this position with your parents and sibling.  That is tough, and I'm not sure there is an easy way out of the family drama.  The best choice would be to have an honest discussion with them.  Tell them you are selling the item to provide for your children.  Maybe even tell them specifically how the money will help.  Hopefully they will see why you are doing this and agree.  But if they don't, that isn't your problem.  It would be a bad idea to sell it to your sibling (paying in installments is a terrible idea and a great way to end up on reddit asking if you are TA in the future).

Sibling was reasonable to ask to buy it, to ask you to take in payments, unreasonable. Parents offering to but it for sibling, unreasonable only because you also help them financially.

If so, move forward with the sale, if not, look for another buyer.\n\nIn this case, the potential buyer does not have the funds to make payment in full, so you'll be moving on to the next best candidate.\n\nI would advise you though to make the intent clear to them that you are moving forward with the sale, just in case they had their heart set on it for whatever reason.", "NTA why are they trying to buy something they can\u2019t afford?

Even if you do sell it, I see from a mile away that the money will eventually end up in the grubby hands of someone in your family.\n\nOverall though, if you are resigned to give money around to family, then I feel like you are fighting a losing battle. You can't realistically control your relatives finances and can't stop them from making bad decisions.
