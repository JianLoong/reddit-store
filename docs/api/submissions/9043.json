You're not invited either then.\"", "NTA well played you knew by her sense of entitlement she would demand make room for her kids. But you kept a spot open so you wouldn't look bad but she would! You are going places my friend! But seriously that night is about you to spend with your closest family and friends.", "NTA. It's *your* graduation. You don't owe anyone anything just because they're family. If you don't want them around, you shouldn't have to. They need to understand when they act the way they do, people won't want to be around them.", "NTA. She's right, you shouldn't have invited any of them. They're not good people and your parents should recognize that. Leave that one seat empty if you have to, but don't uninvite others to accommodate people who don't treat you with the respect you deserve.", "NTA. It\u2019s your party. Invite who want. You invited her out of courtesy, she didn\u2019t accept. Move on and invite another friend, or just leave that spot open.", "NTA. Those \"kids\" are full blown adults and can deal with the fact that they are not invited. Your parents shouldn't even be paying for them or your aunts stuff. Tell your parents that your friends are staying on the list. My suggestion to you is to either keep that last seat empty or find someone else to invite. Your Aunt sounds entitled to money and events that are not for her or her adult children.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your graduation, so you get to say who is invited. Take your aunt at her word and uninvite her. She sounds insufferable.\n\nPS Just because your parents tolerate her, doesn't mean you have to. Be polite to her, but avoid her in future.", "NTA - there is no rule that cousin\u2019s and aunts must be invited to graduation dinners.  Take her at her word: if she does not want to come she doesn\u2019t have to, but either way there is not any room for her kids.  \n\nIt\u2019s pretty typical for people to want their close friends at these events and also to prioritize having close friends there over relatives you are not close with.", "NTA but I\u2019m also intrigued and kinda shocked that your parents paying for her and her inseminated brood living?! What the actual hell?", "NTA\n\nThis is YOUR graduation party and you can invite anyone YOU want to celebrate with. Your aunt said if you can\u2019t accommodate all of them then you shouldn\u2019t invite any of them. I think you need to explain to your parents that this is an important milestone in your life and explain your reasons why you don\u2019t want her there. Tell them you don\u2019t want her kids to make a scene.", "NTA but be careful not to offend your parents when you tell them your aunt won\u2019t come, since their paying for the party. Don\u2019t turn this into a fight, argue about the numbers (it is too much to uninvite 5 friends)and not the people.", "NTA. Stand your ground on this it's either her alone or she stays home. The end. I can't STAND entitled people. Almost my number 1 pet peeve!", "NTA.  Nope\n Uninvite her.", "NTA, uninvite her and invite another friend to your party. There is no reason to be polite to someone so rude. You are now old enough to ignore her and what better time to start then now!", "NTA - but your parents are AH for throwing so much money at her. But that is their choice. You have every right to have a nice dinner without all of the drama that these people would bring. So since she wants you to take back her invitation - do so and invite another friend.", "You would only be the AH if you invited the Aunt or acquiesced to their wishes. Your friends deserve to attend. Your family doesn\u2019t seem to deserve an invite.", "Your graduation! F***em", "NTA. Don't uninvite five friends to accommodate her hellions. Just uninvite her and add another friend. Your enabling parents need  to understand that this is a celebration for and of you, and that while  you're polite to her, your mooch of an aunt is not welcome at this event.", "NTA. It\u2019s your graduation so up to you.", "NTA. It's a question of priorities. There are three here: the venue, you getting to honor the people who have supported you, and your mom getting to honor her family. You can have at most two. You and your mom are disagreeing about which of the three is least important. Both your opinions matter because you are the guest of honor but your mom is the host. It really is her party. (Edited to add: I am assuming your mom is organizing and paying for this; if my assumption is wrong and you're paying for all of it, you're the host and your mom's opinion doesn't matter.)\n\nYour mom believes that your guests are less important than the venue and her relatives. You feel the same way but you value your friends above thise cousins. May I make a suggestion? Sacrifice the venue by choosing a place where you can entertain an extra 5 guests at the same price or less. A backyard BBQ may be an option, or a park picnic.\n\nYour mom may object to a venue change if her goal is to throw a fancy party at this particular venue to kiss the butts of your obnoxious aunt and cousins. If so, what she has in mind (and might be paying for) might be many things but it's not to honor you. She is welcome to have her party, without you. Your empty seat should free up space for at least one cousin, along with the seats vacated by your friends who will no longer have a reason to come.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For some of them, it's a necessary element of their dysfunction, to have a scapegoat to attack emotionally or verbally or more.  They've chosen you.  Could be because you were there.  Could be because you weren't a jerk.  Could be because you were a child doing well and Aunt didn't like that her sibling had a good kid.  Could be because Aunt thought she could get away with saying rude things to you or about you, because the others around you would \"try to keep the peace\" by letting her.  Her reasons don't matter, except to her therapist if she ever gets one and tries to better herself, which isn't likely.
