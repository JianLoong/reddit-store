We've been on holiday for 2 weeks now. My brother Logan (23) has brought along his gf of 9 months Leah (22f). Logan is doing an internship in Boston and that is where he met Leah, who has just graduated from college. We met her for the first time in London, which is where we all met before starting the holiday.\n\nLeah is nice, but in the past two weeks we (me and my parents) have found it a bit weird to go places with her because she always so excited about everything. For example, while waiting for our flights out of the UK, she went around the whole airport lounge filming and narrating it, even though there were other people sitting in it trying to mind their own business. She squealed loudly like a toddler when the plane took off. Every day she asks my mum and me if she can take pictures of our outfits to post on social media, or films us walking around like those candid videos people post online. She gushes about everything. Like I said, she's a nice girl, but being around her is what I imagine being on holiday with your own fan is like, if you were a celebrity (there is a reason I make this comparison).\n\nWe are now in continental Europe, in an area where Logan and I have mutual friends. I am organising a boat outing in a couple of days time, which will include a couple of mutual friends, one of my friends and two of his friends that I don't know very well, who are professional sportsmen. Yesterday, I spoke to Logan and said I really wasn't feeling good about Leah coming. She has made things so awkward on a number of occasions and that's just with family, I can't imagine our friends want to spend all day with someone who acts like they've never seen a boat before. On top of that, I'm potentially exposing people I don't know very well to a fangirl, and to someone who has very few boundaries about what she puts on social media. As a host, I think that's irresponsible.\n\nLogan didn't take well to my concerns. He said he doesn't know what he's supposed to tell Leah and that he was looking forward to seeing our friends. He said I'm being unfair and not giving Leah a chance to \"adjust\". \n\nMy mum is on my side and thinks Leah and Logan should do something else on that day and Logan can organise a separate dinner with his friends. My dad thinks Logan and I should sit down with Leah and explain what we expect behaviour-wise if she wants to come to the outing and have her not bring her phone if necessary, but I think he's being a bit self serving since he's been bugging Logan to talk to her about her behaviour for a week.\n\nI just think that since it's my plan, I'm kind of responsible for everyone's comfort, and it's just easier for everyone to go with my mum's plan. Logan is mad at me for putting him in this position.

Why hasn't anyone said anything to Leah about her behaviour yet? It's just wild that you've been enabling it by letting her take photos of you the whole trip so far, yet she's supposed to magically know that's not okay?", "NTA.  Someone should talk to Leah, respectfully but directly, about her \"enthusiam\", social media boundaries, and what that means in relation to the family and very specifically the friends in question.  Dad is correct here, ulterior motives or not.  Logan really needs to lead that, but if he won't he has to deal with the consequences of that.", "My dad thinks Logan and I should sit down with Leah and explain what we expect behaviour-wise if she wants to come to the outing \n\nI think dad has the right idea. If they met in Boston,I\u2019m assuming she a fellow Yank? Boundaries are different here,and if you explain it to her with an emphasis on cultural differences,she just might get the hint.", "Sometimes you need a break from someone.  This tag-along is starting to ruin your vacation.  He brought her, he can go spend a day with her.  NTA", "She sounds like an American college girl on vacation in Europe for the first time. Lol. I'm American, and some of her behavior just sounds typical. She's raving about everything because she wants to be positive and upbeat. She thinks taking pictures of your outfits is a way to compliment you. Is she an influencer? Her Instagram or Tiktok might be her income, so that's why she's cataloguing her life. \n\nOf course, she could be a lunatic, but this is my first take. You do need to sit down with her for an adult conversation. ie. no more pictures of me at all on social media. No pictures of our friends on the boat--or even, you can't bring your phone. Clearly your brother likes her--maybe the ultra-positive attitude brings sunshine to his day. If she can chill a little, she might grow on you (not like mold, but maybe like a dandelion.)", "NTA but communicating your concerns to Leah would go a long way. Rich or poor, someone constantly recording and taking pictures is extremely annoying lol I would leave out the fan girl part though", "NTA, it sounds like you all need to have a talk with Leah.  I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with being enthusiastic.  If she\u2019s never been to Europe before, she may just be deeply appreciating the whole experience, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something to look down on.\n\nThe problem is the constant social media posting and invasion of privacy.  You have a right to not want to be photographed and filmed and posted on her social media feed without permission.  I can especially understand how it would be a problem when you will be hanging out with a couple of professional athletes who are basically friends of friends, and who might really take their privacy seriously.  Maybe if you talk to her, really emphasize that aspect - that you and your friends might not want their pictures on social media and she needs to respect that.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m noticing that these athletes are actually Logan\u2019s friends.  Maybe Logan knows better about whether his friends will be okay with Leah?  As an outing with mutual friends, this isn\u2019t really a situation where you get final say, but you are not wrong to express concerns.", "NTA and ESH. Honestly, the only things that sound that bad is the social media thing....which unfortunately isn't that uncommon. \n\nWhy haven't any of you said explicitly to her \"Leah, I know you like social media, but I am extremely uncomfortable with being on it and find it violating. I also don't like having my picture taken. Please do not ask to take photos of us at all, and especially do not post them.\" \n\nShe sounds kind of obnoxious,  but it sounds like y'all are just shining her on.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s about time someone told Leah that your family vacation is not fodder for her social media. \n\nI would go as far as to tell her no more pics of me ever. \nIf she wants to post your bro, her bf, not a problem. But not anyone else. \n\nAs for the party, first I would def tell her no phone. You will hold it for her for the day or she can leave it in the hotel. \nAnd no fan girl behavior!  These are your friends. They are not there in a professional setting, this is personal. If she cannot agree to these boundaries then she\u2019s not welcome. \nIt\u2019s may be hard for your friends to even let their guard down with her there anyway- they don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to spread around, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve been in that position before. \n\nAnd if she gets out of line, speak up. Don\u2019t let her get away with it even once. \nI\u2019d even tell the friends they can say something also if she does something they don\u2019t like.", "You are all adults....just talk to her.\n\nTell her your family and friends aren't really into social media like she is.\n\nShe can still film but leave you out of it.\n\nDon't be cruel though.", "NTA because it's your plan and you may invite whomever you please, but what's wrong with your dad's plan? If she's going to stick around for who knows how long (maybe she and your brother will marry someday) you should have a conversation with her to talk about boundaries instead of just disinviting her to plans, because she will feel excluded not knowing the reason why, and will harbor resentment towards you and your mother.", "Let her know that she is expected to be reserved and not show excitement as it embarrasses your family to be seen with such a person. She might be from a family that actually wants to be around each other and enjoy their time together and bonding over experiences. \n\nShe might not have been aware that showing emotion is such a fuax pas. You should absolutely not include her on an outing with the friends you share with your poor unfortunate brother. You have to do it for the good of the family.  What will people think if someone sees an actual human experiencing human emotions while on a trip to a new location. How repulsive. \n\nThe nerve of Logan to even submit your family to Leah's atrocious behavior should disqualify him from all future friendly gatherings. Your parents may even want to look into disowning/disinheriting him for this appalling assault on your tender senses. \n\nOh by the way, YTA.\n\nIf you don't want her to take your pic or film you, use your big girl words and tell her. Same with your self important parents.", "NAH - but you need to learn some perspective. You\u2019re clearly wealthy. She clearly isn\u2019t. She\u2019s not a fan girl, she\u2019s experiencing a part of life that has been heretofore inaccessible to her. You\u2019re a bit of a snob and it would be helpful for you to see things through her eyes.", "Logan needs to talk to her.", "Your dad is right.  Logan is enabling it, and you and your mom are not helping by being what \\*you\\* think is firm.  Silently judging someone without telling them what's bothering you is not going to change their behavior, it'll just make you come across as cold and angry.\n\nThe only way to address it is to actually address it.  You can try to kick your brother out of the plan (AH move) or you can just ignore it (seems to be the way it's been going), or you can actually talk to her.", "NTA.   She wants to take pictures of you and your outfits?  She wants to film you?  That's beyond hyperactively over excited and then becomes boundary pushing.  Honestly, she sounds exhausting.  I do agree that someone...ahem...LOGAN...needs to sit her down and have the talk with her.  And you should do whatever you feel is necessary to keep throwing up your own boundaries and maintaining distance.", "YTA for a woman displaying \"feelings\".", "YTA, this is a direct snub without even talking with her about it first.", "NAH\nFirst of all stop participating in her SM. Agreeing to be photographed and making short videos give her the impression that you are ok with it. \n\nThen actually have a conversation with her. Let her know that you\u2019re not comfortable with it (as it concerns you) and you would rather she not do it if she\u2019s going to be with you and your friends. \n\nAlso know that she\u2019s a completely separate person and she may not agree with you. That\u2019s fine too. Americans have a rap I. Europe for being crass so she will just play into everyone\u2019s stereotypes of the ugly American.", "YTA \n\n\nThese are Logan's friends, too. I'm sure they want to see him, and it might not be easy for them to all go to two events. \n\n\nIf you don't invite her, that's essentially not inviting Logan. If he has to plan his own event, you know everyone's going to ask why it's two separate events, and his answer will be \"Because OP doesn't like my girlfriend. She doesn't want to be around Leah because she says Leah is too excited about vacation.\" \n\n\nYou might have friends unwilling to go to your event if Logan makes plans with them and tells them why it's separate. \n\n\nAnd if they ask you, what do you say? \"I'm doing it for your own good because she will annoy you?\"", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a dick move to ice out your brother\u2019s girlfriend for being \u201ctoo happy\u201d but none of you have the balls to speak to her directly. And you think she won\u2019t figure it out? That the person who has spent the whole trip yelling their feelings would suddenly button up at being shit on? Bold assumption. \n\nI\u2019m picking up that Leah is an American from Boston that has not traveled much at all. Americans are known for being loud and enthusiastic as a way to demonstrate approval and gratitude. Bostonians are also known for being aggressively loud and incredibly direct. It\u2019s very possible she\u2019s never been on a plane or a boat. \n\nHer behavior is what an American would think would show appreciation and gratitude for her boyfriend\u2019s family taking her on a trip. She\u2019s offering to take photos, expressing excitement about what you\u2019re doing, taking an interest in what you wear, etc. \n\nShe cannot read your British cues. We don\u2019t play like this. You HAVE to be direct with her.  Logan should be the one to take the lead, but he\u2019s being a coward. \n\n\u201cLeah, we don\u2019t like our photos taken, and we don\u2019t like to be posted to social media. We\u2019re private. Thank you for the compliment though!\u201d\n\n\u201cLeah, I\u2019m planning a thing with some friends. I know you\u2019re super-excited about traveling, but we want this to be really, really low-key, no photos, just chill. Is that something you\u2019re up for?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeah, our family tends to be really-low key about travel and such. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re having fun, but we are a bit more reserved than you. We want you to keep having fun, but is there a way we could dial it back a notch?\u201d", "If you're not comfortable with her now, what will suddenly make you comfortable with her in a year's time, what about if they get married? She shouldn't have to change for you and your family, that's weird\n\nIf there are specific things like the pictures and such that you don't like then you say to her not to include you in those. Anyone who doesn't want to be included in that should do the same, but YTA definitely for saying someone should not be themselves if they want to simply be tolerated", "YTA, mostly because you\u2019re supposed to sit down and talk, like adults are supposed to do.\n\nThat said, Leah might be a bit overwhelming as a person but she sounds refreshing to have someone with that attitude around, at least for me it would. Also for someone that didn\u2019t have a chance to travel much, going around Europe must be a blast. \n\nI would hang out with her, you and your family sound exhausting and not really the kind of people I would like on holiday but that\u2019s me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA. Big time. Most US citizens never get the opportunity to leave the country. Ever. She\u2019s going to be excited and honestly that\u2019s ok.\n\nLogan is right. She needs time to adjust and you leaving them out is rude. \n\nI\u2019m from Las Vegas Nevada and I\u2019m pretty accustomed to people who act like this. I\u2019ve seen people take pictures of the airport and the multiple Southwest Airlines planes while I am getting on my flight.\n\nMy bf is from Indiana and he had his tourist phase too. That\u2019s no different than what Leah is experiencing.\n\nYou\u2019re supporting my previous experience with other European people. Y\u2019all are sensitive as hell and need to let her be.\n\nThe only thing I agree with you on is taking pictures of you guys without consent. That\u2019s uncalled for and someone needs to have a talk with her about that.", "NTA for not wanting her to come along\n\nIt\u2019s ok to be excited if this is her first trip/first time in Europe. The vlogging, however, sounds annoying af\n\nI would look into your dad\u2019s suggestion - she can come, but she can\u2019t film it. That said, I would also check with your friends to make sure they\u2019re ok with her tagging along", "YTA. Leah\u2019s flaw is being too excited, too happy. So what? No one needs to \u201ctalk to\u201d i.e., shame, this young woman for having an enthusiastic personality. If anything needs to be said, maybe just mention to her that the other guests at the party want privacy from social media. Other than that, just try to accept her as someone who makes your brother happy.", "YTA, it's an event for Logan's friends and him too, he should be allowed to bring his girlfriend. She sounds like she could be annoying, but also excited about taking a holiday in Europe -- for most Americans this is a huge fucking deal, not something they've ever experienced before. She's still your brother's girlfriend, and if he and his friends were already invited then yeah it's pretty rude to decide 'just kidding, you might be annoyed by my brother's girlfriend having a good time.' like obviously he wants to introduce her to his friends? and gasp, what if it's her first time on a boat, are you going to be annoyed if she takes a video and is excited about it?\n\nYou've decided she's such a hassle that you'd be a bad hostess if she was invited? I think you don't really understand what a good hostess is -- someone who makes all their guests feel welcome. I don't think her gushing about being on a boat is going to ruin it for everyone else, but uninviting her is certainly making your family a bad host. You're being rude to someone who has the potential to be a part of your family. Talk to her about her behavior (the only thing i can see here is posting stuff on social?), don't talk to her, but definitely don't decide she's not allowed to come now.", "NTA. I think Logan is T A here. He brought someone who interrupts everything for social media purposes. I've seen some comments where people think this is a class issue. I did not see that here. It seems that behaviors such as narrating an airport scene and constantly filming for social media are more about Leah controlling the situation and making everything about her wishes. I am not rich and I would find her annoying!\n\nRegardless of whether she goes to meet your friends, Logan needs to talk to her. He brought her, he can talk to her. Either that, or he needs to spend time with her alone.", "YTA You\u2019re annoyed that she acts like an overexcited kid about everything but you don\u2019t talk to her like an adult. \n\nHey, Leah, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re having a good time on this vacation but we really do not feel comfortable being filmed and live streamed every day. We\u2019re planning this boat trip with X & Y and if you\u2019d like to attend I\u2019m going to have to ask you to keep it off of social media. \n\nIf she gives you any crap then ok fine, but right now no one has told her anything so she thinks her behavior is fine.", "Yta.   How dare this girl be excited about life and want to take pictures with people \n\nAll that matter is that your brother is happy with her .

The fact that she\u2019s been doing it for a week and there have been no talk with her whatsoever just encouraged her to behave the same since one thing is to refuse in the moment when she probably didn\u2019t rly realise what you all were trying to say and didn\u2019t rly understand the discomfort she caused (that is not great either, but in her mind it was probably \u201cjust pictures\u201d and she couldn\u2019t even think what kind of discomfort she was causing y\u2019all), while if Logan would\u2019ve had the talk with her after a couple of days in a relatively calm environment she probably would\u2019ve behaved herself a bit more towards your standards. Overall I feel like the dad has the greatest plan out of everyone and I feel like that could be a way to find a compromise rather than just cutting her off entirely.", "+1 to the dad\u2019s plan, *especially* not taking her phone. That\u2019s a really easy one to justify from making it sound like a boating safety issue if breaching the topic of her behavior generally still feels odd.", "They do tell her\n\n\u201cWe always tell her no when she asks for photos. The candid videos I don't care about ask long as I'm not tagged, but my mum has told her to stop twice (she always just says \"but you look so nice\").\u201d", "She asks and they say no, she still takes the photos/videos. That\u2019s the issue.\n\n OP didn\u2019t write the post clearly but she clarifies in a comment. \n\nFrom OP:\n\u201cWe always tell her no when she asks for photos.\u201d", "They won't even have a discussion with her about it though. They could easily have a calm discussion from a place of attempted understanding but they won't even do that. I agree with the above comment, I think she's seriously overwhelmed with this family's lifestyle, to the extent that even their clothing seems magical to her. Brother should've had a talk with her from the get go, but they've had time to all do something about it since then. Now she'll have no clue why when they start ignoring her. It's a little compassion is all.", "I certainly considered that this is likely her first international trip and possibly first plane ride. Even factoring that in, I thought that \"squealing like a toddler\" - *if accurate as a description* seemed over the top. I also saw in the responses that OP and her mother had tried to non-confrontrationally dissuade Leah from filming them but she brushed off their objections. I think that Leah should try to \"read the room\" when using social media - regardless of what her friends at home want to see. I definitely think that Logan owes it to his family *and to Leah* to help foster a better relationship between Leah and the family where possible.", "Well OP should say that shit originally. She TA for not doing that too"]}
