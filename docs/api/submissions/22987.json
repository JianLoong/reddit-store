{"id": 22987, "submission_id": "157ve04", "title": "AITA for being pissed that my in-laws are pissed?", "selftext": "OK so I am so angry at my in-laws and I\u2019m not sure if my feeling are valid or if I am an asshole\nMy husbands mom went to urgent care today with high blood pressure and was sent to the ER. She had my father in law with her, as well as her sister and her brother in law, too.\nMy husband must have called them about 25 times over the course of the afternoon. Each time my father in law gave him less than adequate information which we just shrugged off as him being distracted by the fact that his wife was in the ER. My husband asked EVERY time if they thought he needed to come there. Each time they said no. They were just taking tests and waiting for results and the dr seemed fairly confident she\u2019d be discharged and sent home this evening.\nMy husbands parents didn\u2019t have their car at the hospital- they took an ambulance there. My husband asked them to call when they were getting discharged so he could come drive them home.\nWe waited all evening to hear from them. Finally around 7:15 my husband called AGAIN only to find out THEY WERE TAKING THE TRAIN HOME. Why? Because they were upset that he never came to the hospital. That he should \u201chave known\u201d to come and shouldn\u2019t have had to be asked.\nTo me, THIS IS INSANE! And I am so so so angry that they would say that to him. To try to make him feel badly? He is an only son who does EVERYTHING for them- from helping with bills to filing taxes and anything in between. OF COURSE my husband would have dropped everything to go to the hospital BUT THEY SAID NOT TO. I think it\u2019s sick to play that kind of mind game on someone and I am so so so angry. Am I the asshole? Should he have gone despite their refusal? Should he have known they meant something other than what they said? Or is it that fact that they were trying to \u201ctest\u201d him in a way that makes them the assholes?????", "created_utc": 1690159270, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157ve04/aita_for_being_pissed_that_my_inlaws_are_pissed/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He repeatedly asked if he should come and was repeatedly told no. He repeatedly offered to drive them as well. He did what was reasonable. His parents got unreasonably upset.", "NTA \n\nYour in-laws are being completely immature, and this strikes me as a regular feature of their behavior. No means no, so why would they ever think your husband would hear \u201cyes come to the hospital\u201d when they said \u201cno don\u2019t come\u201d. \n\nYour husband is asking for the bare minimum of communication and candor for them. He is doing all the work to initiate. All they have to do is not lie. I think it\u2019s time for your husband to think about stepping back from his parents a bit for his own emotional well-being.", "NTA. I would be pissed for him!! It seems like they\u2019re doing this to make him feel bad (or like you said, to test him) because otherwise they would have at least taken him up on the ride. \n\nPersonally, if I was really worried I probably would have still gone to the hospital, but he did ask like 25 times, so they have no reason to be mad.", "NTA. They can\u2019t be angry when they say one thing but mean another. They are adults and they need to use their adult words to express what they want.\n\nDon\u2019t fall for this - keep asking them things and then acting in line with what they say. Show them the mind games won\u2019t work.", "NTA. It sounds like your husband needs to take a step back from his parents.", "NTA. No one is a mind reader. Your husband tried to get answers from them and they didn\u2019t want to answer. Seems like they\u2019re playing victim to a situation they created.", "NTA for being pissed, in-laws are just stupid", "NTA. They\u2019ve probably been doing this to him his entire life. It\u2019s time to stand up for your husband by saying things like \u201che explicitly ask you to call when you needed a ride home and you didn\u2019t. Taking the train home is on you\u201d the next time they bring it up.", "NTA. Those types of parents are the worst. You/he tried, they were petty. They are old enough to use their words and if those words include lying and emotionally manipulating you/your husband then leave them to their own devices.", "NTA - sometimes too many people crowds the space anyway. If they wanted him there, they should have said yes when he asked.", "NTA. Tell your in-laws to use their grown up words. Your husband is not a mind reader.", "NTA. Those kinds of mind games piss me off too.", "NTA     Parents can be huge pains in the a$$.    It's damned if you do and damned if you don't.", "NTA. Your in-laws are playing games so it's time for them to win stupid prizes. Since they obviously do not appreciate the things your husband does for them, it's time for him to stop doing them. When they get pissy, just remind them of this moment and that they showed their true feelings with their idiotic games. Your husband does not deserve to be disrespected.", "They all took the train back? What happened to the sister and brother in law?", "How dare he respect their wishes \ud83d\ude21\n\nNTA. I really wish we all had mind reading capabilities, but sadly, we don't.", "YTA Your husband called them 25 times?  They are dealing with the emergency onsite .  If hubby was so concerned that he was constantly calling, perhaps he should have made his way to the hospital to support his family.", "Info: Who is \"they\" that said don't come repeatedly specifically?\n\nDid he ever talk to his mom? His dad wasn't giving much information you say. Since they were just waiting for test results, did he ask to talk to his mom?\n\nEdit: If he never asked to talk to mom, then he's the AH. \n\nQ: If you were told your mom was sent to the ER with high blood pressure, and you were within range, would you go, or would you wait around all afternoon and into the evening while she was in the ER, and you were given vague information via phone from someone else?", "NTA. Your inlaws are being passive-aggressive, narcissistic assholes. He did EXACTLY what they told him to do and then they played petulant teenage girl when he didn't magically appear to save the day. He should have magically known what to do per them. That's bullshit and they need to be called out on it.", "NTA. Their behavior is truly vile. If they want to set tests and traps for family, I very serious family meeting is in order, with them understanding that LC is on the table. Outrageous.", "You husband was put through the ringer by his father,\n\nThe only plausible explanation I can conceive of is the father is losing his mental faculties.  Is that possible?\n\nPeople have to speak yup when they need help.  Humans are not NOT mind readers.\n\nIf what you said is accurate, then NTA", "I disagree, it's normal for the patient to be focused on their recovery, they shouldn't be fielding phone calls from everyone asking for updates and whether to come and etc. If you have a large family the amount of talking needed can just multiply. In this case, her husband was there and knows her well enough to decide for her or ask her for clarification.", "They shouldn't be \"fielding phone calls from everyone\"?  It's her SON.\n\n And dad was being vague. And they were sitting there waiting for results.\n\n I'm a mom with a grown kid. And I would hope my grown child would want to talk to me personally and ask how I'm doing if I'm scared and waiting for test results for hours (all afternoon and into evening) especially if dad is giving vague answers.", "So you are happy sitting in a hospital bed, fielding doctors, nurses, people calling you and asking what the visiting hours are, when you want them to come, can you repeat what the doctor told you, how long to come for, what times need to be covered because other people aren't available, etc? That's ridiculous. Notice this mum has more than one kid plus her sister there. \n\nBlame the HUSBAND, he did not do his job.", "Wow\u2026your FIL is a prick. OP NTA. Your husband ASKED multiple times if he should come and THEY kept refusing. Fuck that. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA\n\nTell them that since they say the opposite of what they really want, you take it to mean that they are fine and do not need or deserve an apology... and you agree.", "I hate these kind of passive aggressive manipulative \u2018tests\u2019 that set you up to fail so they can have a drama. Ignore and move on. Don\u2019t reward them with the attention they want", "I'm wondering if the father was even listening to the conversation with his son.", "I wouldn\u2019t want my child to disrupt his day unless there was something to worry about. Without results there nothing you can do but wait. I got my partner who promised to be there for me. I do not need my child too. \n\nPlus if I truly wanted my child to come then I would ask my partner to ask them to come."]}
