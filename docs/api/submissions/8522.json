I talk to him most days to see how he is doing (I'm 30 and as all adults do have my own responsibility and either way I'd still like to think I'm a good brother) I shut her down completely saying my brothers mood and me getting married are nothing to do with each other.she sounded drunk when after a few exchanges which I was exceptionally polite in considering the circumstances decided to phone me where I told her that she has no right and that I've done nothing wrong. She then decided to suggest I won't see my brother again which is ridiculous and seems if I'm honest completely crazy. My little brother messaged me apologising for his mums behaviour and it turns out she told him when she apparently started screaming at my dad because I'm getting married. It all seems really bizarre my dad and brother are on my side. But it seems very abnormal.
