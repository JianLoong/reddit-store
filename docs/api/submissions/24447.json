Anyone who says what she said is an awful person and ugly on the inside, and frankly she probably knows that she sucks.

That line of thinking is so hard to break out of and the fact that she's trying to undo all the progress you've made makes my blood boil.", "Ick well we found your true problem!

I can\u2019t begin to imagine how difficult recovery would be with an evil mother like that. EDs are a deadly disease (the highest mortality rate of any mental illness for women). You are so young and have so much love and happiness ahead of you - for your own safety and survival you need to get as far away from your mother as soon as possible. She will drag you down and destroy you. Sending you love and light - you are beautiful!!", "NTA at all. You\u2019re at a healthy weight, and would still be at a healthy weight at your previous weight. Your mom is role-modeling unhealthy behavior and being critical where it isn\u2019t at all necessary. What she said is the kind of cruelty that can be traumatizing and get in your head when you\u2019re exposed to day after day. My advice would be to make sure to practice positive affirmations in your head, so that you\u2019re in the habit of drowning out her \u201cmusic\u201d with a new song, so to say. So making sure to think things like \u201cMy body is healthy,\u201d \u201cIf my body is hungry, it\u2019s okay to eat,\u201d \u201cMy mother\u2019s thinking is distorted and doesn\u2019t reflect reality,\u201d etc. when situations like this come up. Sometimes the most critical people around us become our own \u201cinner voice\u201d before we realize it, and I don\u2019t want that for you. And know that\u2019s it\u2019s a totally okay and normal response to cry and feel hurt when someone in our lives treats us so poorly. It sounds like you\u2019ll be out of that environment in a year or so, you\u2019re in the home stretch now so it\u2019s just sort of trying to mentally cope with it until then. If she wants an apology, I would just say something like \u201cI was upset with what you said, because the way you speak to me isn\u2019t how I plan to talk to myself. I apologize for snapping, but I\u2019m communicating now, proactively, that any comments like that will not be well-received in the future, and I\u2019d appreciate it if you avoided commenting on my body.\u201d", "Ntah, I think it was just a heated moment between the two of you. You are in the right to be upset, but hopefully you can talk things over.", "Don't shove dishes at people. That could've physically hurt her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
