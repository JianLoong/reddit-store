You do the majority, including cooking and grocery shopping.\n* He is alone in the house with your child for only a very short period of time each day, so it can't be said that he does much childcare either. He certainly doesn't do the morning and bedtime routines, because you do those.\n* He takes on none of the intellectual load of running a household and being a parent, such as paying bills and dealing with the school. You do that.\n* Despite your workload, he expects you to run his personal errands for him.\n* He gives you \"major attitude\". He calls you abusive and toxic. He says you're degrading him. He says you're not a good person.\n\nI have two questions for you:\n\n1. What does he do all day while you are at work?\n\n2. What exactly does he bring to this marriage? Is the sex mind-blowingly awesome, or something?\n\nYou've listed a multitude of things you dislike about him, and not a single thing you do like, not a single thing he contributes to the relationship.\n\nI am genuinely wondering why you bother to stay with him.", "NTA and he\u2019s gaslighting you. Like a lot.", "This shit is always funny to me. For six months I operated as a \"stay at home dad\" for my Girlfriend and her 4 year old sister she just got custody of (Mom was abusive).\n\nI didn't think it was hard at all. If you keep up on things it isn't that big of a deal. Neither was the kid.\n\nAnd thats also considering we didn't have an on site washer and dryer or a car, so I had to take a bus with our laundry to a laundromat across town while the kid was in school.\n\nWhat is with all these deadbeat stay at home parents? I wish I could be back in that position again instead of working 60 hours a week in a factory.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He is lazy and taking advantage of you. My husband also stays home while I work (from home) but he cooks, cleans, takes care of the kids, takes them to and from school & appointments, brings me food and coffee when he notices that my meetings have gone back to back for a while and I haven't had a break. There is nothing wrong with a guy being a SAHD but he should be taking care of the brunt of household needs. You deserve better.", "DIVORCE PLAIN AND SIMPLE!!", "NTA. It sounds like he's accusing you of being abusive and toxic to avoid taking responsibility for his own action or lack there of.", "Just want to say thank you to everyone. I appreciate the wake up call. I had to stay late at work since I spent the morning dealing with his car. He kept texting that I\u2019m hurting our son by not coming home, I\u2019m a bad mom, etc. I\u2019ll be contacting a lawyer tomorrow.", "NTA.\nI rrely advocate for this, but...go see a good lawyer without telling him, discuss all the options, including that he has a grad degree he isn't using. Then divorce him, ask for custodial parent with joint custody (if he's been a good father), and sue him for child support. A judge sually won't take kindly to him not working when he's capable.", "NTA it sounds like you either created a lazy entitled partner by doing everything for them or you married someone who wanted to still be a child and not a grown up....so they now expect you to do everything while they do the minimum. \n\nPersonally I would get into marriage counseling", "NTA. He\u2019s been taking advantage of you purposely your entire relationship.", "He can because you allow it to be this way.", "Absolutely NTA. But if you want to make this marriage work, you guys need to get into counseling ASAP, this is the kind of dynamic that can absolutely kill a relationship. Also, may I suggest that, to the extent it's possible, you just *stop* doing some of the stuff that he should be doing? Obviously you need to keep your child alive and fed and clothed - but don't offer to take his car to the mechanic, don't call the auto shop yourself, don't remind him his car needs inspecting. He's taking advantage of you, but you're letting him.", "NTA except to yourself for letting the imbalance go on for so long.

Why you have put up with this nonsense for even one second (which has apparently existed from even before you were married) is totally beyond me.\n\nYou listed about 523 reasons why the situation (and he) is horrible... and not even one single positive. Literally not one.", "NTA. You are so clearly unhappy that it makes me sad. Good luck to you but you are not the problem here.", "When I was a sahm there was no chore my husband was responsible for. Not one. I took care of the house inside and out and the kids and him. I cooked every night and took everyone to their appointments.  I was up before him and my day ended long after his. I cannot imagine how hard it is to do everything you do!  That\u2019s more than two full time jobs as far as aim concerned. I wonder if your husband is sick, depressed, or simply has decided to let you do it all. No, you\u2019re NTA for being upset.", "NTA at first glance, although I'm curious about how he justifies calling you that. Does he give any examples?\n\nWhat does he do all day at home?", "NTA. I didn't realise humans could marry leeches!\n\nHonestly, what does he bring into the relationship? It sounds like you have two children to look after instead of having a husband and one child.", "Too bad you let this go on for so long as it may impact how much alimony you have to pay him. Time to lawyer up.\n\nNTA", "So you carry not only your, but your husband\u2019s share of chores - and when you point that out he accuses you of being toxic and controlling. Projection aside, he is freeloading off you.\n\nFor all practical purposes you are already functioning as a single parent already, maybe better make it official so at least you have a chance of meeting somebody who will actually appreciate you?\n\nNTA", "Divorce him before he qualifies for alimony!", "This guy is dead weight. Why on earth would you think you're the AH? I'm a stahm and this is exactly the job description. You needed him to take the car in and he refused and moaned about it. GURL. Run away. He's not as smart and brilliant as all that. He's a butt head.", "NTA. Why do you need this man? You\u2019re doing everything on your own. If he isn\u2019t make your life easier, he is a burden.", "NTA. If your child is in school full day and you are handling most of the household tasks as well as working full-time and financially providing, what exactly is he bringing to the table?

You're name-calling. He is absolutely right. That's fighting dirty.

He is definitely being an asshole by doing so little to contribute, but you\u2019ve let him do this since you got together and it\u2019s still the same. I\u2019m not sure why you expected him to be different and now you\u2019re punishing him for it. I agree he\u2019s not pulling his weight, but you\u2019ve let this go on for so long he doesn\u2019t have any expectations on him.
