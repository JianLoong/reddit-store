She's already in therapy. Once a month ever since I could afford it.  I recommendation by her doctor. Her appointment was last weekend she went came back and DIDNOT want to talk about it. I think I've done a good enough Job that if she wants another session this month she can ask either of us to schedule it . She has done so in the past and even if she is mad at me I think she'll still feel comfortable enough with my wife\n\n3.

But you know and acknowledge that already and apologised.\n\nThat said, I get that the word sounded strange from your sister; she obviously hadn't called you so before. Her parents died, but they are still her parents. You are her brother who stepped up. You seem like a good guy and it is well within your rights to not let yourself be called dad if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\nSit her down, talk it out calmly, apologise again, and let her down gently. Tell her you love her, nothing changed about your relationship, you will be there for her, but you are not her dad.", "Not wanting to break her heart is a good start. Recognizing you have done some damage here, is also good. \n\nYou need to have a heart to heart with her. Talk about your feelings. It may something to do with a feeling  that it erases your dad in some way. She was six when he died, so her memories are fading, but you had more years with him. \n\nWhat is most important is she knows and understands that you love her completely and are always going to be there to love and support her.  Maybe you can together come up with a unique name that doesn't erase his role and place in your lives but recognizes the special type of relationship you have. Bro-da? You are her \"parent\" and she needs to know this new child in the house isn't going to displace her, or take away from the bond you have with her. \n\n\nIt was an AH reaction. I think you know that. How you handle this from here determines whether you are indeed the AH.", "The situation is difficult, but I would say YTA: you have been raising her since she was 6, by now she barely remembers her parents and you are her main parent figure. You probably broke her heart by yelling. \n\nBut I also think that your reaction is coming from the grief of your father's loss and you are a great person for taking care of her", "It sounds like you could do with some therapy to work through why this upset you so deeply - that kind of response points to some pretty severe issues, and it\u2019d be better for you and your sister if you figured out why you feel that way and work through it.\n\nA good therapist could also guide you through how to deal with this rift between you and your sister, and help her cope with her pain and issues.  I\u2019m guessing, since finances were tight, that she didn\u2019t get counseling after her parents died and her whole world was radically altered.  No criticism intended, you had a lot on your plate and limited finances, but it sounds like she could still benefit from talking to a therapist, especially one who is experienced with this kind of upheaval and grief.\n\nI\u2019m reluctant to call someone who is dealing with trauma TA, but obviously you know that kind of reaction wasn\u2019t healthy and it would help you both to address it and see about healing both your wounds.", "YTA and you need to see therapy here. I feel heartbroken for your sister. If she can\u2019t be like the now sibling she\u2019s being raised with and call you dad, she just\u2026 doesn\u2019t have any parents at all? She is going to be the odd one out in this family as she grows. You could love her 1000% and always be there for her and never yell at her but she will still have those feelings here and there- but you cemented them in with your reaction here. \n\nYou should have individual therapy - each of you. And family therapy when you both can take it. This is a really sad situation over all.", "Therapy. Not just for her, for you as well. Your extreme emotional reaction to her trying to make sure that she still has a place in the family (because that's what she's doing, trying to make sure that you're not replacing her with your new baby) is something that you need to explore with a professional. \n\nNAH, but you're on thin ice if you ignore the fact that you're having mental issues about this as much as she is.", "I have a very hard time calling you Ta. You took care of your sister. But in her eyes you are her dad. The only dad she will ever know. How you reacted to that is not okay. You need to start a conversation with her about why she called you dad. And explain why you don't feel comfortable with it.", "YTA, it is ok if you don't feel comfortable with her calling you dad, but screaming at her for something that I'm sure she did from her heart and without thinking is really AH. She doesn't have any parents, and screaming to her that way I'm sure made her feel awful.", "YTA for yelling, but otherwise NAH.\n\nhonestly this should have been expected. you're an older, influential male in her life who is taking care of her, looking out for her, who has  legal custody over her... yeah, its a logical leap in logic.\n\nnow im not making fun of you op, but your sister isnt gonna understand the complexities of family life. now whether or not you want to be referred to as *dad* is up to you but dont be surprised (or yell!) *when* it happens again. \n\ndoes she refer to your wife as mom? is she gonna see your son as brother rather than cousin? are you gonna bristle every time someone wrongly refers to you \"ah you must be her dad!\"?\n\njust prepare yourself op, its gonna get more complicated from here on out", "Soft YTA since you understand your overreaction.\n\nBut def sit her down and talk to her. You've already done the hardest part when you took her in as a young guy yourself and you did all the right things. Just assure her that all that will continue and you're happy to do it even though you are not her father. Maybe you can even share some stories of your dad from when you were young so she can get some memories from him.", "if i had to choose between this two options then YTA. \n\nbut this is more deep than \"i did something wrong or not\". you know you overreacted without thinking and you apologized, clearly you know that something isnt right. the only suggest i can give is if its in your possibilites search for therapyst. you and your sister will beneficiate a lot of it and in time develop a stronger relationship and how to handle these situations in better ways, since it can happen again", "Well YTA for your reaction, not for your feelings on the subject. There\u2019s a thousand healthier ways you could\u2019ve dealt with that, not to mention the poor example you provided everyone in that situation. \n\nTry setting a better example and having communication with her. Maybe look into counseling for you both since it triggered such an uneven response.\n\nEdit to add: I want to make it clear that yelling is abusive. There\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t communicate with healthy words. And you need to learn how to better regulate your emotions. Another reason for therapy.", "NAH, she obviously sees you as a father figure because you are her father in every way but one. \n\nAnd I get how being called dad might make you feel uncomfortable. I might not have reacted the same way but I can't judge you. Apologizing is a good start. But maybe take it a step further, take her to lunch or sit with her privately and tell her that it scares you and try to elaborate on why in a way you think she is equipped to understand. And I would have that same conversation with the wife too of course.", "YTA, for yelling. Getting spooked or feeling uncomfortable with something like that is one thing, yelling and freaking out over it, something else. With that being said, if you feel that you really overreacted, maybe you should see a therapist about it? I mean, you have been plunged into an extremely traumatic chain of events and I don't even want to imagine how hard all of that must've been, so maybe that was your emotional baggage yelling? Just an observation, otherwise, good on you for apologising.", "To me it seems your over reaction has more to do with loosing your own dad and having to take on the role of parent at a young age, rather than being called dad by your little sister.  I would explain this to her and let her know you are a proud brother raising his amazing sister. Soft YTA for screaming at her.", "NAH, with one caveat.  You have to get into therapy.  This was pretty obviously an unknown place for you, and I can understand the kind of visceral reaction you describe, but you can\u2019t do this again.  Get the help you need, not just for her, but for you and the little one.\n\nYour dad sounds like he did a fine job teaching you.  Such a good job that she sees you as her dad now.  For what it\u2019s worth, I think your dad would be proud of you because here you are stepping up for the last 5 years.\n\nETA: Apologize to your sister right away, or as soon as you have the words you want to use.  \"Hey, I'm sorry I freaked out.  I don't know why, but I felt really overwhelmed in the moment, and I handled it really poorly and not in the way you deserve.  I'm glad to know I've been doing a good enough job that you want to call me dad, it really does mean a lot to me, and I'm going to work to be the dad you deserve\" might be a good start.", "Soft YTA. You can't help feeling upset, but taking it out on the kid who has lost both parents? People lose their parents in their 40s and 50s and aren't ready for this kind of loss, she's 11 and she probably needs to feel like a part of a more nuclear kind of family. \n\nYou might want to look into some counseling for both of you, you seem like a really nice and responsible person, so maybe you have some feelings built up inside that only surfaced now. It's worth looking into.", "YTA. You have done a lot of great things for her, but your reaction to an 11 year old looking for permanency/validation was not okay. I think you need to reevaluate why that freaked you out so much. At this point you've taken on rolls of the parent and she probably doesn't understand why she can't rely on you to be her dad. She needs that stable role model and at that age to be able to call you Dad gives her a feeling of security I'm sure. I think you need to reevaluate and talk to your wife and then have a conversation with your sister. I have a very strong feeling that she is feeling extremely insecure now.\n\nAlso, YTA is only for your reaction in this one scenario. You seem like a good person.", "NTA...yet. You said you and little sis shared a Dad, and he died. You immediately stepped into the role of raising sis.  \n\n\n>But something about it feels so utterly wrong and out of place I couldn't help overreacting.\n\nTo hear her call you DAD may have triggered some unresolved trauma for you. That may be why you had your freakout. It was painful to suddenly think of y'all's Dad, and realize she doesn't see him as \"Dad.\" But you still do.\n\nYour sis is 11. You love her. She wants you to be her Dad. What a 4th wheel she will feel like if you, wife, and son all use the word \"Dad\" but she isn't allowed to. Let her use it. \n\n*But you have to have a one-on-one conversation with her and explain why the freakout happened-*\\-that it brought up pain from the loss of y'all's dad. She will understand.", "YTA for yelling and rejecting your sister. You need to talk to her. Don't just apologise - explain and be honest. Whatever it triggered in you, she needs to understand that it's not a rejection of her (at least I hope it wasn't for that poor girl's sake).\n\nOp if she calls you dad, that doesn't mean you are replacing your dad. You can still talk to her about him and show her what he was like, help her feel a connection to him. Calling you dad may give her security, esp now you have your own child who calls you dad. If you can't let her call you it, then maybe you could find other ways to make her feel loved and secure of her place in the family.", "YTA for seeking help on reddit when you all clearly need some serious counseling. For the love of God get off of here and Google a family/trauma counselor.", "Oof that's rough. You're definitely trying to do the best by her, I'm going to go with a very mild YTA since it seems like you're already regretting your outburst. \nFirst introspect on why you reacted the way that you did. Did you feel like it disrespected the memory of your father perhaps? \nThen try putting yourself in her shoes. Understand that you're the father figure she has known for the majority of her life and this might have been an innocent Freudian slip. \nHave an honest dialogue and define your relationship in a way that works for both of you. Apologize. Consider family therapy. You obviously care about each other a lot so maybe get that across in a non confrontational way. The worst thing you can do right now is to ignore her feelings and let any misunderstandings fester.", "YTA (which is hard for me to say, with all the good you've done for your sister)\n\nBut look at it this way:  you have been the main paternal figure for almost half her life.  She will NEVER have anyone to call Dad.   Now she sees herself as part of a family, you, your wife, baby, and she wonders what her role is.   She feels like your daughter and a sibling to your child, so she tests out calling you dad.  And your response is to yell at her?  \n\nIt sounds like you were thrust into this role at a young age and stepped up to the plate.  Maybe you still have some baggage and pent up resentment about having to take on so much responsibility.    That would be totally understandable.  But see a therapist and talk about it.  Dont take it out on your innocent little sister for looking up to you.", "Honestly NAH.\n\nWhat you did was reflexive and not really controllable. Hindsight is always 20/20 so ofc you could've handled it better. Something tells me you never really handled your own trauma from the1 accident cuz you were too busy taking care of your sister. Now you had a freakout cuz your dad is truly gone, in body and memory? \n\nAin't nothing you can do about the yelling now other than proceeding forward. Do you want to be a dad to your sister? Either way, tell her and apologize for yelling.", "NTA.  I get it.  You lost your father as well and don't want to take his place.  It was not a great response, but you are human and you apologized.  Once you process that, maybe you can explain your reaction to her.\n\nAnd btw, my friend is a male teacher and many times children, especially those without a father figure in their lives, call him dad by accident.  The kids are mortified when they realize their mistake, but he pretends like he didn't hear it and doesn't make an issue of it.  It's not uncommon.", "NTA strictly to the question in the title\n\nYou cannot help how you feel, and you should have explained to your sister that you love her very much but she had a dad who loved her just as much and that you can never take his place but that you will always be big brother.\n\nThat said \nYou are a Massive YTA for yelling at her to the extent that you scared your toddler and left her in tears.\n\nThere was a much kinder manner to deal with your sister which would have left her feeling loved and valued and you messed that up big time. You yelling that you are not her dad let's her hear I don't love you \nThat's a really crappy thing to do to someone you love", "YTA\n\nYou are also insane. What kind of ridiculous reaction was that?", "OP, you are a great person for what you have done, but you have overreacted.  I do not see what can be done now", "YTA. Kinda?\nShort version:: You were in shock and taken by surprise, so your feelings were valid; the yelling has been addressed and apologized for. It's about how you move forward from here and I'd really recommend talking with a family therapist, individually and together, to find what works for you. Maybe it doesn't have to be \"dad.\" Maybe it can be something special between the two of you but still recognizes the relationship you essentially have as her father now.\n\nLonger version:: \nYou apologized for the yelling and if they've forgiven you for it, then I'll look past it.\n\nHowever, a dad, a father (which is what you have been to her) is a manner of character and actions, ones you have demonstrated and shown to her and others that you're filling this role in her life. She probably doesn't remember her parents much, if at all. You are her parent in all but name, and prior to now, she's never expressed differently but maybe she finally felt comfortable and she sees you as her father. This is more than just getting custody - you've actually cared for her and raised her - and she, in a way, was trying to honor you and do what she probably thought was right. \n\nBefore you talk with her about this, you need to decide why this bothered you the way it did and what you're going to do about it. What should she call you? Your kid is going to see her as a sister. But you can't talk to her until you sort out your own feelings about the situation.\n\nAnd look, you did adopt her. It's more than just signing custody (like stepparents \"adopting\" their spouse's kid and still aren't called dad and don't earn it and yet go throwing the word around)... You have done a lot for your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

It never occurred to you that you are her father figure? Even in the lead up to having a baby with your wife? \n\nYou need to figure out why your reaction was so intense. Have you dealt with the passing of your father? Have you formally adopted your sister? Would she want that? Would she want your wife to adopt her too?

Yeah definitely TA and your edits don't help.", "YTA You yelled at her (a innocent child) and locked yourself in your room. Leftyour wife with that mess. That was very childish.

You are the male figure on her life. And if being called a dad scares you so much why do you have a baby?", "YTA - I really didn't want to say that when I read the title, but exploding over something that trivial indicates you need therapy. Putting myself in your shoes, I would hazard to guess you miss your dad a lot, and hearing your sister call you dad instead of him really touched that hurt.", "YTA.\n\nYou took your angst on a child, without rationalizing it, without trying to communicate, without putting yourself in her shoes. You could have use this a moment to talk about your dad, that it makes you happy that she loves you as a dad (even if it's a white lie because it made you uncomfortable on the spot), but that she shouldn't forget that her dad loved her very much and that you don't want to replace him, but that you love her anyway she calls you. But what you did is making her feel undesired, especially now that you have your own child and she's old enough to consider that she doesn't have a place in your family any more. I understand it's not an easy subject to come around, but come on, poor sister.", "Huge AH. She is struggling to find where she stands in your life, pre-teen age is extremely hard, hormones and high school don't make it easy.

And I totally commend and respect your wife for doing an excellent job.", "YTA for your reaction and for trying to sweep this under the rug and go back to normal. Apologizing for yelling isn\u2019t enough. She was probably nervous about how a new baby would affect her place in your family and you just loudly told her she is not on the same level as your son. Now instead of working through your own issues and making sure she feels loved and accepted, you\u2019re trying to sweep in under the rug even though you admit you know your sister is still hurting. It\u2019s hard to call the person who stepped up an AH for their feelings, but in this case you have a long ways to go to make this right.

If you\u2019re not comfortable with it, you need to talk to her gently and explain why you\u2019re not comfortable with her calling you dad with the help of a therapist.

I wanted to call him that for a while and finally mustered up the nerve around 8 or 9 years old. He had an awkward response that I yelled at him for, but he apologized and we talked, and after that he was dad. It was such a relief for my little kid self to once again have someone to call dad. Your sister might have been having similar thoughts. Have you asked her why she called you dad?\n\nAlso, the fact that she felt comfortable and loved enough to call you dad in the first place is an amazing testament to you stepping up. I\u2019m sure your dad would be proud of you.", "Gently YTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to have properly processed your grief over losing your dad, so hearing that you yourself have replaced him in your sisters eyes has hit you hard. But your reaction probably hit her so much worse.\n\nI think you need some grief counselling, and to have an honest conversation with your sister about this. Tell her you\u2019re sorry for how you reacted and that you need help dealing with your grief and that you\u2019ll hopefully be able to explain more about it once you\u2019ve processed it better.", "Soft YTA. Because you are the adult and you should have been prepared that this could be a subject at some point. You hurt her. She lost her parents and now is feeling some rejection from the person filling a parental role. I get that you were startled and you recognize it was the wrong way to react. By all accounts you are doing some fantastic things. The right things. You are raising your sister. Providing for her and trying to see she has what she needs. But...what about you? It's great that you have her in counselling but you lost your father too and with raising your sister there are challenges to navigate for her best interest and wellbeing. You can't just awkwardly ignore the outburst and you don't want to make it worse in a clumsy attempt to fix it. Sis isnt the only one who needs counselling. You ALL do. Even your wife because she has taken on a huge responsibility too.", "NAH. \n\nShe did nothing wrong, but said something you weren't ready for. You reacted badly, and apologized.  It's all understandable.  Everyone can only do their best.", "It's really interesting because he doesn't mention much about their relationship before his own child enters the picture. I wonder if this has more to do with psychological aspects of having raised your younger sibling in the middle of becoming \"dad\" to your own genetic offspring. No right or wrong answers regarding it, I just thought it was interesting that it didn't really hit OP that his sister views him like that, though he's been filling that role for many years. The 10 year old, too, with the birth of a new child and having the baby grow up into a more independent talking child may be giving her some kind of anxiety - like she needs to establish her place in the family because she knows you aren't \"dad\". This is all very sad (your parents passing) and I'm very sorry OP. You can make this right.", "Yes, my first thought is OP probably doesn\u2019t want to replace the memory of their parent. I think is NTA as long as OP deals with this. \nOP: Go to therapy, take your sister to therapy, talk things out and apologize. This can be a great opportunity for you to teach her you are human and also screw up, that feelings and grief are complex, BUT that you will always be there for her no matter what.", "This. I get that OP must have troubled feelings. But her acknowledgment of him as father-figure would habe brought me to tears. \ud83e\udd72", "I second this! I think family therapy will benefit everyone greatly. This is such a hard topic, and the 10 year old is going to be going through some major self identity issues in the coming years with puberty. The sooner she's confident with her past, the better it will be for her.", "Grief"]}
