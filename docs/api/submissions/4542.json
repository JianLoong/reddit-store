She's already in therapy. Once a month ever since I could afford it.  I recommendation by her doctor. Her appointment was last weekend she went came back and DIDNOT want to talk about it. I think I've done a good enough Job that if she wants another session this month she can ask either of us to schedule it . She has done so in the past and even if she is mad at me I think she'll still feel comfortable enough with my wife\n\n3.

But you know and acknowledge that already and apologised.\n\nThat said, I get that the word sounded strange from your sister; she obviously hadn't called you so before. Her parents died, but they are still her parents. You are her brother who stepped up. You seem like a good guy and it is well within your rights to not let yourself be called dad if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\nSit her down, talk it out calmly, apologise again, and let her down gently. Tell her you love her, nothing changed about your relationship, you will be there for her, but you are not her dad.", "Not wanting to break her heart is a good start. Recognizing you have done some damage here, is also good. \n\nYou need to have a heart to heart with her. Talk about your feelings. It may something to do with a feeling  that it erases your dad in some way. She was six when he died, so her memories are fading, but you had more years with him. \n\nWhat is most important is she knows and understands that you love her completely and are always going to be there to love and support her.  Maybe you can together come up with a unique name that doesn't erase his role and place in your lives but recognizes the special type of relationship you have. Bro-da? You are her \"parent\" and she needs to know this new child in the house isn't going to displace her, or take away from the bond you have with her. \n\n\nIt was an AH reaction. I think you know that. How you handle this from here determines whether you are indeed the AH.", "The situation is difficult, but I would say YTA: you have been raising her since she was 6, by now she barely remembers her parents and you are her main parent figure. You probably broke her heart by yelling. \n\nBut I also think that your reaction is coming from the grief of your father's loss and you are a great person for taking care of her", "It sounds like you could do with some therapy to work through why this upset you so deeply - that kind of response points to some pretty severe issues, and it\u2019d be better for you and your sister if you figured out why you feel that way and work through it.\n\nA good therapist could also guide you through how to deal with this rift between you and your sister, and help her cope with her pain and issues.  I\u2019m guessing, since finances were tight, that she didn\u2019t get counseling after her parents died and her whole world was radically altered.  No criticism intended, you had a lot on your plate and limited finances, but it sounds like she could still benefit from talking to a therapist, especially one who is experienced with this kind of upheaval and grief.\n\nI\u2019m reluctant to call someone who is dealing with trauma TA, but obviously you know that kind of reaction wasn\u2019t healthy and it would help you both to address it and see about healing both your wounds.", "YTA and you need to see therapy here. I feel heartbroken for your sister. If she can\u2019t be like the now sibling she\u2019s being raised with and call you dad, she just\u2026 doesn\u2019t have any parents at all? She is going to be the odd one out in this family as she grows. You could love her 1000% and always be there for her and never yell at her but she will still have those feelings here and there- but you cemented them in with your reaction here. \n\nYou should have individual therapy - each of you. And family therapy when you both can take it. This is a really sad situation over all.", "Therapy. Not just for her, for you as well. Your extreme emotional reaction to her trying to make sure that she still has a place in the family (because that's what she's doing, trying to make sure that you're not replacing her with your new baby) is something that you need to explore with a professional. \n\nNAH, but you're on thin ice if you ignore the fact that you're having mental issues about this as much as she is.", "I have a very hard time calling you Ta. You took care of your sister. But in her eyes you are her dad. The only dad she will ever know. How you reacted to that is not okay. You need to start a conversation with her about why she called you dad. And explain why you don't feel comfortable with it.", "YTA, it is ok if you don't feel comfortable with her calling you dad, but screaming at her for something that I'm sure she did from her heart and without thinking is really AH. She doesn't have any parents, and screaming to her that way I'm sure made her feel awful.", "YTA for yelling, but otherwise NAH.\n\nhonestly this should have been expected. you're an older, influential male in her life who is taking care of her, looking out for her, who has  legal custody over her... yeah, its a logical leap in logic.\n\nnow im not making fun of you op, but your sister isnt gonna understand the complexities of family life. now whether or not you want to be referred to as *dad* is up to you but dont be surprised (or yell!) *when* it happens again. \n\ndoes she refer to your wife as mom? is she gonna see your son as brother rather than cousin? are you gonna bristle every time someone wrongly refers to you \"ah you must be her dad!\"?\n\njust prepare yourself op, its gonna get more complicated from here on out", "Soft YTA since you understand your overreaction.\n\nBut def sit her down and talk to her. You've already done the hardest part when you took her in as a young guy yourself and you did all the right things. Just assure her that all that will continue and you're happy to do it even though you are not her father. Maybe you can even share some stories of your dad from when you were young so she can get some memories from him.", "if i had to choose between this two options then YTA. \n\nbut this is more deep than \"i did something wrong or not\". you know you overreacted without thinking and you apologized, clearly you know that something isnt right. the only suggest i can give is if its in your possibilites search for therapyst. you and your sister will beneficiate a lot of it and in time develop a stronger relationship and how to handle these situations in better ways, since it can happen again", "Well YTA for your reaction, not for your feelings on the subject. There\u2019s a thousand healthier ways you could\u2019ve dealt with that, not to mention the poor example you provided everyone in that situation. \n\nTry setting a better example and having communication with her. Maybe look into counseling for you both since it triggered such an uneven response.\n\nEdit to add: I want to make it clear that yelling is abusive. There\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t communicate with healthy words. And you need to learn how to better regulate your emotions. Another reason for therapy.", "NAH, she obviously sees you as a father figure because you are her father in every way but one. \n\nAnd I get how being called dad might make you feel uncomfortable. I might not have reacted the same way but I can't judge you. Apologizing is a good start. But maybe take it a step further, take her to lunch or sit with her privately and tell her that it scares you and try to elaborate on why in a way you think she is equipped to understand. And I would have that same conversation with the wife too of course.", "YTA, for yelling. Getting spooked or feeling uncomfortable with something like that is one thing, yelling and freaking out over it, something else. With that being said, if you feel that you really overreacted, maybe you should see a therapist about it? I mean, you have been plunged into an extremely traumatic chain of events and I don't even want to imagine how hard all of that must've been, so maybe that was your emotional baggage yelling? Just an observation, otherwise, good on you for apologising.", "To me it seems your over reaction has more to do with loosing your own dad and having to take on the role of parent at a young age, rather than being called dad by your little sister.  I would explain this to her and let her know you are a proud brother raising his amazing sister. Soft YTA for screaming at her.", "NAH, with one caveat.  You have to get into therapy.  This was pretty obviously an unknown place for you, and I can understand the kind of visceral reaction you describe, but you can\u2019t do this again.  Get the help you need, not just for her, but for you and the little one.\n\nYour dad sounds like he did a fine job teaching you.  Such a good job that she sees you as her dad now.  For what it\u2019s worth, I think your dad would be proud of you because here you are stepping up for the last 5 years.\n\nETA: Apologize to your sister right away, or as soon as you have the words you want to use.  \"Hey, I'm sorry I freaked out.  I don't know why, but I felt really overwhelmed in the moment, and I handled it really poorly and not in the way you deserve.  I'm glad to know I've been doing a good enough job that you want to call me dad, it really does mean a lot to me, and I'm going to work to be the dad you deserve\" might be a good start.", "Soft YTA. You can't help feeling upset, but taking it out on the kid who has lost both parents? People lose their parents in their 40s and 50s and aren't ready for this kind of loss, she's 11 and she probably needs to feel like a part of a more nuclear kind of family. \n\nYou might want to look into some counseling for both of you, you seem like a really nice and responsible person, so maybe you have some feelings built up inside that only surfaced now. It's worth looking into.", "YTA. You have done a lot of great things for her, but your reaction to an 11 year old looking for permanency/validation was not okay. I think you need to reevaluate why that freaked you out so much. At this point you've taken on rolls of the parent and she probably doesn't understand why she can't rely on you to be her dad. She needs that stable role model and at that age to be able to call you Dad gives her a feeling of security I'm sure. I think you need to reevaluate and talk to your wife and then have a conversation with your sister. I have a very strong feeling that she is feeling extremely insecure now.\n\nAlso, YTA is only for your reaction in this one scenario. You seem like a good person.", "NTA...yet. You said you and little sis shared a Dad, and he died. You immediately stepped into the role of raising sis.  \n\n\n>But something about it feels so utterly wrong and out of place I couldn't help overreacting.\n\nTo hear her call you DAD may have triggered some unresolved trauma for you. That may be why you had your freakout. It was painful to suddenly think of y'all's Dad, and realize she doesn't see him as \"Dad.\" But you still do.\n\nYour sis is 11. You love her. She wants you to be her Dad. What a 4th wheel she will feel like if you, wife, and son all use the word \"Dad\" but she isn't allowed to. Let her use it. \n\n*But you have to have a one-on-one conversation with her and explain why the freakout happened-*\\-that it brought up pain from the loss of y'all's dad. She will understand.", "YTA for yelling and rejecting your sister. You need to talk to her. Don't just apologise - explain and be honest. Whatever it triggered in you, she needs to understand that it's not a rejection of her (at least I hope it wasn't for that poor girl's sake).\n\nOp if she calls you dad, that doesn't mean you are replacing your dad. You can still talk to her about him and show her what he was like, help her feel a connection to him. Calling you dad may give her security, esp now you have your own child who calls you dad. If you can't let her call you it, then maybe you could find other ways to make her feel loved and secure of her place in the family.", "YTA for seeking help on reddit when you all clearly need some serious counseling. For the love of God get off of here and Google a family/trauma counselor.", "Oof that's rough. You're definitely trying to do the best by her, I'm going to go with a very mild YTA since it seems like you're already regretting your outburst. \nFirst introspect on why you reacted the way that you did. Did you feel like it disrespected the memory of your father perhaps? \nThen try putting yourself in her shoes. Understand that you're the father figure she has known for the majority of her life and this might have been an innocent Freudian slip. \nHave an honest dialogue and define your relationship in a way that works for both of you. Apologize. Consider family therapy. You obviously care about each other a lot so maybe get that across in a non confrontational way. The worst thing you can do right now is to ignore her feelings and let any misunderstandings fester.", "YTA (which is hard for me to say, with all the good you've done for your sister)\n\nBut look at it this way:  you have been the main paternal figure for almost half her life.  She will NEVER have anyone to call Dad.   Now she sees herself as part of a family, you, your wife, baby, and she wonders what her role is.   She feels like your daughter and a sibling to your child, so she tests out calling you dad.  And your response is to yell at her?  \n\nIt sounds like you were thrust into this role at a young age and stepped up to the plate.  Maybe you still have some baggage and pent up resentment about having to take on so much responsibility.    That would be totally understandable.  But see a therapist and talk about it.  Dont take it out on your innocent little sister for looking up to you.", "Honestly NAH.\n\nWhat you did was reflexive and not really controllable. Hindsight is always 20/20 so ofc you could've handled it better. Something tells me you never really handled your own trauma from the1 accident cuz you were too busy taking care of your sister. Now you had a freakout cuz your dad is truly gone, in body and memory? \n\nAin't nothing you can do about the yelling now other than proceeding forward. Do you want to be a dad to your sister? Either way, tell her and apologize for yelling.", "NTA.  I get it.  You lost your father as well and don't want to take his place.  It was not a great response, but you are human and you apologized.  Once you process that, maybe you can explain your reaction to her.\n\nAnd btw, my friend is a male teacher and many times children, especially those without a father figure in their lives, call him dad by accident.  The kids are mortified when they realize their mistake, but he pretends like he didn't hear it and doesn't make an issue of it.  It's not uncommon.", "NTA strictly to the question in the title\n\nYou cannot help how you feel, and you should have explained to your sister that you love her very much but she had a dad who loved her just as much and that you can never take his place but that you will always be big brother.\n\nThat said \nYou are a Massive YTA for yelling at her to the extent that you scared your toddler and left her in tears.\n\nThere was a much kinder manner to deal with your sister which would have left her feeling loved and valued and you messed that up big time. You yelling that you are not her dad let's her hear I don't love you \nThat's a really crappy thing to do to someone you love", "YTA\n\nYou are also insane. What kind of ridiculous reaction was that?", "OP, you are a great person for what you have done, but you have overreacted.  I do not see what can be done now", "YTA. Kinda?\nShort version:: You were in shock and taken by surprise, so your feelings were valid; the yelling has been addressed and apologized for. It's about how you move forward from here and I'd really recommend talking with a family therapist, individually and together, to find what works for you. Maybe it doesn't have to be \"dad.\" Maybe it can be something special between the two of you but still recognizes the relationship you essentially have as her father now.\n\nLonger version:: \nYou apologized for the yelling and if they've forgiven you for it, then I'll look past it.\n\nHowever, a dad, a father (which is what you have been to her) is a manner of character and actions, ones you have demonstrated and shown to her and others that you're filling this role in her life. She probably doesn't remember her parents much, if at all. You are her parent in all but name, and prior to now, she's never expressed differently but maybe she finally felt comfortable and she sees you as her father. This is more than just getting custody - you've actually cared for her and raised her - and she, in a way, was trying to honor you and do what she probably thought was right. \n\nBefore you talk with her about this, you need to decide why this bothered you the way it did and what you're going to do about it. What should she call you? Your kid is going to see her as a sister. But you can't talk to her until you sort out your own feelings about the situation.\n\nAnd look, you did adopt her. It's more than just signing custody (like stepparents \"adopting\" their spouse's kid and still aren't called dad and don't earn it and yet go throwing the word around)... You have done a lot for your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

It never occurred to you that you are her father figure? Even in the lead up to having a baby with your wife? \n\nYou need to figure out why your reaction was so intense. Have you dealt with the passing of your father? Have you formally adopted your sister? Would she want that? Would she want your wife to adopt her too?

Yeah definitely TA and your edits don't help.", "YTA You yelled at her (a innocent child) and locked yourself in your room. Leftyour wife with that mess. That was very childish.

You are the male figure on her life. And if being called a dad scares you so much why do you have a baby?", "YTA - I really didn't want to say that when I read the title, but exploding over something that trivial indicates you need therapy. Putting myself in your shoes, I would hazard to guess you miss your dad a lot, and hearing your sister call you dad instead of him really touched that hurt.", "YTA.\n\nYou took your angst on a child, without rationalizing it, without trying to communicate, without putting yourself in her shoes. You could have use this a moment to talk about your dad, that it makes you happy that she loves you as a dad (even if it's a white lie because it made you uncomfortable on the spot), but that she shouldn't forget that her dad loved her very much and that you don't want to replace him, but that you love her anyway she calls you.

I understand it's not an easy subject to come around, but come on, poor sister.", "Huge AH. She is struggling to find where she stands in your life, pre-teen age is extremely hard, hormones and high school don't make it easy.

And I totally commend and respect your wife for doing an excellent job.", "YTA for your reaction and for trying to sweep this under the rug and go back to normal. Apologizing for yelling isn\u2019t enough. She was probably nervous about how a new baby would affect her place in your family and you just loudly told her she is not on the same level as your son. Now instead of working through your own issues and making sure she feels loved and accepted, you\u2019re trying to sweep in under the rug even though you admit you know your sister is still hurting. It\u2019s hard to call the person who stepped up an AH for their feelings, but in this case you have a long ways to go to make this right.

If you\u2019re not comfortable with it, you need to talk to her gently and explain why you\u2019re not comfortable with her calling you dad with the help of a therapist.

But Y T A", "YTA.", "YTA", "I know you apologized to your sis but she will remember this negatively forever. If you haven\u2019t told her why you reacted the way you did you need to (once you figure it out).

I wanted to call him that for a while and finally mustered up the nerve around 8 or 9 years old. He had an awkward response that I yelled at him for, but he apologized and we talked, and after that he was dad. It was such a relief for my little kid self to once again have someone to call dad. Your sister might have been having similar thoughts. Have you asked her why she called you dad?\n\nAlso, the fact that she felt comfortable and loved enough to call you dad in the first place is an amazing testament to you stepping up. I\u2019m sure your dad would be proud of you.", "Gently YTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to have properly processed your grief over losing your dad, so hearing that you yourself have replaced him in your sisters eyes has hit you hard. But your reaction probably hit her so much worse.\n\nI think you need some grief counselling, and to have an honest conversation with your sister about this. Tell her you\u2019re sorry for how you reacted and that you need help dealing with your grief and that you\u2019ll hopefully be able to explain more about it once you\u2019ve processed it better.", "Soft YTA. Because you are the adult and you should have been prepared that this could be a subject at some point. You hurt her. She lost her parents and now is feeling some rejection from the person filling a parental role. I get that you were startled and you recognize it was the wrong way to react. By all accounts you are doing some fantastic things. The right things. You are raising your sister. Providing for her and trying to see she has what she needs. But...what about you? It's great that you have her in counselling but you lost your father too and with raising your sister there are challenges to navigate for her best interest and wellbeing. You can't just awkwardly ignore the outburst and you don't want to make it worse in a clumsy attempt to fix it. Sis isnt the only one who needs counselling. You ALL do. Even your wife because she has taken on a huge responsibility too.", "NAH. \n\nShe did nothing wrong, but said something you weren't ready for. You reacted badly, and apologized.  It's all understandable.  Everyone can only do their best.", "It's really interesting because he doesn't mention much about their relationship before his own child enters the picture. I wonder if this has more to do with psychological aspects of having raised your younger sibling in the middle of becoming \"dad\" to your own genetic offspring. No right or wrong answers regarding it, I just thought it was interesting that it didn't really hit OP that his sister views him like that, though he's been filling that role for many years. The 10 year old, too, with the birth of a new child and having the baby grow up into a more independent talking child may be giving her some kind of anxiety - like she needs to establish her place in the family because she knows you aren't \"dad\". This is all very sad (your parents passing) and I'm very sorry OP. You can make this right.", "Yes, my first thought is OP probably doesn\u2019t want to replace the memory of their parent. I think is NTA as long as OP deals with this. \nOP: Go to therapy, take your sister to therapy, talk things out and apologize.

With a new baby on the house and her not having any parents, she's going to be confused and wanting that relationship. I suggest going to the therapist together so you can express that you aren't her dad but are her brother even though you are her caretaker. Being a father figure is okay but she's going to have issues dealing with the lack of bio parents, especially the next few years going through puberty and middle school. I hope you can have open and honest communication. Good luck!", "I think in this situation you made an asshole move by yelling, but I don't think you're an asshole.

And two, your attachment/bond with your sister is going to be different then to your child.  Not by all that much, I'm sure, but nonetheless, different.  So take some time to get therapy for yourself as well as your sister.  You were TA in that moment and you will have to come to terms with yourself on what you want your sister to refer to you as.  You should also understand that her feelings towards you are not wrong,  It just points out how well you are doing in raising her.", "You not the AH, but you definitely could have handled it better, just sit her down and tell her you love her, that she\u2019s your sister and that is never going to change and that you\u2019ll always be there for her", "YTA for the yelling and locking yourself away part. \n\nMaybe you guys can go get ice cream together or something she likes to do when you talk about it and you explain that both of your dad was an important person in your lives and her calling you dad just freaked you out, not because you don't love her and want to take care of her like your dad would've, but that her saying that made you feel like you were replacing your dad and nobody can ever take his place. And then talk about your dad together, good memories you both have, things you remember about your dad from when she was a baby, special things with your dad that you think she might enjoy now. \n\nThis is likely a super tough situation for both of you, so I get that you freaked out, but I also get that now that your own child is saying dada, she's testing out the word.", "YTA for yelling but you lost your dad too so I\u2019m sure it brings up a lot for you as well.

I think maybe joining her in therapy for a few sessions if she\u2019s open to it so you can all discuss. You may also want to speak to a therapist yourself.

Tell her big brother is a special title that only she gets to use, and that\u2019s pretty damn important to you. \n\nAnd get your wife some flowers and date night for bailing and leaving that mess in her lap.

Obviously I'm guessing based on a couple paragraphs and could be totally wrong, but... Your sister hears your son call you dad(a). She may have wanted to be a part of that and have the same thing because understandably she sees you as a father figure and misses  having her/ your dad. She may also be a little nervous or jealous since you have a child. She's at a really vulnerable age and especially after losing her parents/ family she may be afraid of it happening again, just in a different way.\n\nAs far as your reaction, I wonder if it had anything to do with your grief over losing your dad. Her father is your father and you both lost him. Maybe subconsciously it felt like if you are \"dad\" you would be replacing him, which I imagine you don't want to do. If this is the case, I would encourage you to talk to her and explain that you love her and you are a family (I think emphasizing that she is part of your growing family and always will be is important), and you are so honored that she would use that word for you, but that it feels like replacing your dad which you know you can't and would never want to do. Maybe the two of you can also come up with a different special name/ moniker that she can call you that lets her express her feelings for you but doesn't make you uncomfortable. If it isn't, hopefully you can have the same talk just with a different explanation for why you are uncomfortable being called dad.\n\nALSO, with everything going on and so many emotions and probably some trauma at play, I would see if she would be open to a family session with her therapist. Hopefully the therapist can help you both figure out what happened and why, and make sure you are both communicating and can get past the awkwardness and hurt.\n\nI hope things get better quickly. You are a great brother and it sounds like you have an amazing family.\n\nEdited to add NAH (leaning towards a soft Y T A) because you are all dealing with so many things.

You were in the middle of school. Money was tight. And then on top of that, you were suddenly the caretaker of a seven year old girl. A 1st-2nd grader. Meaning you had to focus on taking care of her, doctor appointments, conferences, helping with her homework, all on top of your own schooling and a job and dating. Something tells me you had to put a lot of your mental health and grieving on the back burner in order to ensure that you all just made it to the end of every week for a long time. \n\nI don't think the idea of being dad scares you or makes you uncomfortable, as you seem to have no issues with your own child. \n\nI think what's wrong here is that it's only now just starting to hit you how much of a hole there is in your life that used to be filled by your parents being there.

Your sister calling you dad is just the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak. \n\nYou're not her dad. In an ideal world, you still wouldn't be her dad-like-figure. But at a very young age, just barely figuring out the adult world yourself, you were left with the responsibility of becoming the closest thing to a dad your sister has left.

Maybe a few sessions separate, and then a session with your sister. Maybe spend time looking at photos if you have them, or talking about memories of your parents with her. Share recipes you and mom and/or dad cooked, or go places they used to take you.

You realize how profound and deep the connection is between a good father and his children and all the emotions towards losing your own father at a young age came back and you temporarily lost it.\n\nI urge you to find your own therapist to unpack your own baggage about the loss of your father. Maybe call your sisters therapist and tell her what happened and ask if you can attend one of your sister sessions to explain how you felt at that moment. She is most likely feeling rejected by you and thinks that you don't love her. Her therapist can help her understand that this is a YOU problem and that while you need to work on your own issues, you still love her and she did nothing wrong.", "You're in the wrong, but I don't think you qualify entirely as TA. You already apologized for your overreaction, but here's how I see it.\n\nNow that your child has started speaking, your sister might just be calling you dad so the child will know you as dad and not by your name, similar to how parents might refer to your grandparents as \"grandma and grandpa\", just so you'll keep calling them that when you're young. If she does see you as a father figure, then that's a different story, but I think you are overreacting.", "INFO: You apologized, but did you actually try to talk to her about the situation. Listen... if you don't do anything to address this with her, then Y T A. If you try to make it right, then N A H, because no one is perfect and sometimes our reactions are out of line. It's what we do next that matters. Therapy is great, but her therapist can't make this right for you. You have to do that. Apologizing is the first step, sure, but having an honest conversation with her about how much she means to you and WHY you reacted like that is necessary.", "INFO-OP can I ask did you have a good relation with your Dad? \n\n The reason I'm asking this is because if it was a good relationship then this may very likely be due to grief. One of my cousins raised two of his siblings  when his parents passed away. He too would become incredibly upset if anyone called them his kids. He always said that he could not take his parents place and all the siblings shared the same grief. For him taking the title of Dad meant erasing his parents and was a sign of disrespect.\n\nIts obviously very complicated feelings and you might potentially be feeling the same. OP its ok if you decide that you rather have a sibling than another child and vice versa. Do what feels true to you. I think going to therapy will be a good idea to unknot what you are feeling.", "Soft YTA\n\nObviously for raising your voice.  But you did apologize and admit that you were wrong.  You talked about your feelings with her, which is important. She took you off guard and you reacted.  It happens. \n\nYou are not a TA for not wanting to be called \"Dad\". Just let her know that you love her and you see yourself as a father-figure and a big brother, but not \"dad\". And that's okay.  Hopefully she can work through that.", "Gently,  YTA. I get why this might be weird, you were already in your 20's when this happened. In your world, she is clearly your father's child and your ward. But you got 25 years with your dad, she got 6. She's been with you almost the same amount of time as she was with him. Whether you see it that way or not, you *are this girl's father* in her eyes. While that might be awkward for you (and you deserve time and space to process why that is) is a totally natural flow. She's likely seeking someone to call mom or dad to feel like she's really got a \"normal\" place in a \"normal\" family.", "I think they should avoid family therapy until he\u2019s had his own for a bit. I think he has a bit of unprocessed grief, maybe even some survivor\u2019s guilt. Deal with that first or else he\u2019ll just end up being an AH in the therapist\u2019s office instead of one in the kitchen.", "I'm sure there's more than \"a bit\" of difficult emotions since he is an orphan as well (by definition, his father is deceased) and taking on his sister I wonder if he ever had time to process the grief? He has no parents since his mother isn't in the picture. There has got to be a lot of trauma around parenting but has he processed it?"]}
