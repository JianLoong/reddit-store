They don't really want you to leave because they will miss you but they also want you to be safe.  Your inlaws don't want to not see the kids so want you to stay for selfish reasons rather than looking at the bigger picture.\n\nThings can happen anywhere... but you are now living in a country that's considered a warzone and the area where there is current fighting/bombing... will likely extend.\n\nIt's safer to leave now when it can be more orderly... than if you are leaving as there are soldiers and artillery being used around you.", "This is a heavy thing to consider. I\u2019ve never lived in a place that has happened, but maybe consider making a list of life style things that are the best for your family.

Some would rather die in their own house and some would not care about location as long as they had family. \n\nNTA for prioritizing your family needs over what others want.", "Nta, stay safe", "NTA\n\nIt's not your responsibility to save/solve everything, especially in a global conflict like war.
