{"id": 11179, "submission_id": "11ev2vq", "title": "AITA for not getting rid of my dog after it attacked a family member?", "selftext": "Kind of a convoluted situation, but I\u2019m currently dealing with dozens of angry family members so I could really use some clarity. \n\nI (34F) have six dogs. Five are rescues and very gentle, and one is a 120 lb Akita, Toby, who listens well but isn\u2019t super friendly. It\u2019s a lot, but I have a decently sized home and several acres of property so it\u2019s manageable. \n\nThe problems started a few weeks ago when my brother (32M) and my sister in law (36F) asked to stay in my guest house for a week while they took care of some business. I agreed, especially because then I would get to see my 5 year old niece. \n\nImmediately, my SIL started making negative comments in our group chat and to my mother about my dogs, which I ignored. When my brother and SIL got to my house I gave them a keychain with keys to the guest house and the main house on it just in case. My SIL was still complaining about my dogs but I didn\u2019t think much of it. \n\nWell, about halfway into their stay, I wake up in the middle of the night to my dogs going crazy. The four smaller dogs sleep in their beds in my bedroom, but the two large male dogs sleep by my front door (inside). I\u2019m a single woman living in a very rural area, so I like having them there just in case. \n\nEventually I heard glass break and I was ready to dial 911, but then I heard my SIL\u2019s brother\u2019s (late 30s?) voice. I ran out to my door and see Toby holding on to my SIL\u2019s brother\u2019s arm through the window on my door. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t know what to think and it took me a second to process everything. I would say after about 30 seconds I called Toby off, and he and the other dog both got away from the door. By that time I guess the screaming woke my brother and SIL up and they showed up and started freaking out, and my SIL called an ambulance. What followed was the longest night of my life, getting my SIL\u2019s brother stitched up and talking to several police officers. \n\nI\u2019m still confused about it. According to my SIL, she decided that her brother should stay with them at the guest house (and didn\u2019t tell me?). Then she gave him a key when she saw him in town that day, but accidentally gave him the key to my house instead. When he got in (drunk and at 3am), he tried the guest house, couldn\u2019t get in, and then tried my house, which unlocked the door but not the deadbolt. So that\u2019s when he decided to break the glass and undo the deadbolt from the outside, which led to Toby biting his arm. \n\nNow, my SIL as well as her brother, my mother, and several of my extended family members are insisting that I \u201cget rid of\u201d at least Toby and maybe all of my dogs because I\u2019m \u201ctoo irresponsible to have them\u201d, and that I\u2019m an asshole for refusing. But I bought Toby specifically to keep me safe, and when he thought that a man he didn\u2019t know was breaking into my house, he tried his best to stop it. So I\u2019m really not mad at him for that? \n\nOverall, I\u2019m confused and upset and really need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong here.

I ran out to my door and see Toby holding on to my SIL\u2019s brother\u2019s arm through the window on my door. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t know what to think and it took me a second to process everything. I would say after about 30 seconds I called Toby off, and he and the other dog both got away from the door. By that time I guess the screaming woke my brother and SIL up and they showed up and started freaking out, and my SIL called an ambulance. What followed was the longest night of my life, getting my SIL\u2019s brother stitched up and talking to several police officers. \n\nI\u2019m still confused about it. According to my SIL, she decided that her brother should stay with them at the guest house (and didn\u2019t tell me?). Then she gave him a key when she saw him in town that day, but accidentally gave him the key to my house instead. When he got in (drunk and at 3am), he tried the guest house, couldn\u2019t get in, and then tried my house, which unlocked the door but not the deadbolt. So that\u2019s when he decided to break the glass and undo the deadbolt from the outside, which led to Toby biting his arm. \n\nNow, my SIL as well as her brother, my mother, and several of my extended family members are insisting that I \u201cget rid of\u201d at least Toby and maybe all of my dogs because I\u2019m \u201ctoo irresponsible to have them\u201d, and that I\u2019m an asshole for refusing. But I bought Toby specifically to keep me safe, and when he thought that a man he didn\u2019t know was breaking into my house, he tried his best to stop it. So I\u2019m really not mad at him for that? \n\nOverall, I\u2019m confused and upset and really need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong here.

They should all be kissing Toby's Tail wagging ass!", "Absolutely! \n\nToby protected his mum and siblings from someone breaking into their house but backed off when called -> Very good boy. \n\nSIL took advantage of OP\u2019s kindness by inviting another guest to stay without asking her (because clearly she would have said no if this is normal behaviour for that jerk) and her brother is as bad -> a pair it entitled AHs.", "The goodest boy!!", "A well meaning reply but after something like this a neutral response is best. You don't want a dog thinking they'll get love every time they bite someone.", "Thank you. I\u2019ve definitely thought about it being a set up; my SIL obviously dislikes me and has tried to force me to change things about my lifestyle in the past. I\u2019m trying really hard to keep the peace because I love my niece and they\u2019re really the only family I have close, but I\u2019m thinking it might not be worth it anymore.

Everything is on her.\n\nAnd who, even drunk, breaks a window instead of ringing the door or calling on a phone when he knows someone is waiting for him inside the house? If your SIL was expecting her brother to come, she should had kept her phone with her in case of. Everything is fishy here except your dogs reaction.", "Kick them all out of the guest house, now.

Also OP take this chance in the upset & drama, to throw them all out. \n\nThink they otherwise will stay rent free. Have the wild suspicion that the business is them cancelling their rented house, due to debts or some other bad karma hitting them. \n\nAnd if they already try to overrule, not respecting boundaries, get rid of your best defender, set up the family against you now, it will only get worse. They sound like really bad news, stuff like that will affect your loved ones wellbeing & prosperity.\n\nThrow them out now while you still can OP!!", "I thought the same exact thing. Toby is best boy.", "Thank you. He\u2019s never been aggressive, he\u2019s just not overly friendly either, with dogs or people. When I have guests over he usually stays in his bed or his crate. I do muzzle him when there\u2019s kids around like my niece, but when it\u2019s adults I usually just tell them to give him some space and it\u2019s never been an issue before. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry you were attacked, that\u2019s horrible. The reason I think I might be TA is because I now have a dog who has attacked someone and I obviously would never want him to hurt someone seriously.

I wouldn't trust them around any of her dogs after this.\n\nIt's mind boggling to me that the family is trying to say OP is \"irresponsible\" when the SIL gave a key to a home that isn't hers away without asking. If Toby hadn't been there, what else would that guy have done if he was willing to literally break in?", "Exactly this! Someone did break into the house. And was immediately apprehended!", "Seriously even if you just drop charges the next day. They could escalate and try to get your dog put down. They seem so worked up and nuts about it that they might really do that.", "And immediately change the locks, don\u2019t even bother collecting all your house keys. Who knows if SIL had made copies.", "Apparently he got one", "They have a large property so the dogs probably has enough leg room to run around and play, plus the 6 dogs can play with each other.

You seem to be coming down on SIL but don't want to call her an asshole?", "That\u2019s actually a good point about the brother\u2019s possible motives that I hadn\u2019t considered.

She and my brother have their own company and they had some meetings in a town about 20 minutes from my house (they live over an hour away). I was happy to let them stay with me, it made sense so they wouldn\u2019t have to drive back and forth. But I\u2019ve only met her brother a handful of times, like at my brother\u2019s wedding and my niece\u2019s birthday parties. I have no idea why he was even in town or why he would want to stay on my property.", "Thank you. I\u2019m confused about it too - literally everyone in my family is saying I was reckless, but my friends think I\u2019m in the right, so I didn\u2019t know what to believe. Cops didn\u2019t do anything about the dog because they saw the window was broken, and also by the time they got there Toby was calm and just sitting at my feet.", "I'm also questioning how he arrived at the property while sloppy drunk. Taxi and uber service usually isn't great in super rural areas.", "I truly don\u2019t think any of this was an accident, friend. She gave him exactly the key she intended to, and he knew which building it was for. They had something nefarious in mind for you.", "I\u2019m sure he remembers the fear he felt in that situation. It was scary for him too. \n\nIt sounds like he loves you very much, and would do anything to protect you. Please protect him in return!", "I don\u2019t understand that either. According to my SIL, he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to wake anyone up so late\u201d and was frustrated from being locked out of the guest house. But he was definitely drunk (so drunk he tried to attack Toby after the door was open, and my brother had to get him to stop) so I guess it\u2019s just that. I\u2019ve only met this man a handful of times before the incident so I don\u2019t really know him well.", "This dog protected his home. Exactly what op said she wanted him for ,her protection.

Are you serious? \n\nLet her know THEY need to be gone by tomorrow. \n\nThe audacity is stunning.", "Oh my gosh kick them out!", "If the person he attacked was some random stranger **not** vaguely related to you who intended to do you harm would you still feel bad that Toby bit him? Because Toby didn't and couldn't have known the difference. \n\nHell, if you came on here asking if you were TA for shooting the guy who **broke a window to get in your home while you were alone and asleep** I would still say NTA. So would the law in most states.", "No, you have a dog that stopped a drunk man after he broke a window to get into your home. Your dog did his job. He shouldn't be punished for doing his job.

I\u2019m not a dog person, but heck I\u2019d want that dog as well. And the audacity of her brother to break your glass to get into your house. He totally deserved what he got.", "Yeah, all it took was someone literally BREAKING into your house to prove her right!", "He bit someone breaking into your home. That's a good dog!", "Toby protected you from an intruder, period.\n\nMaybe if strange, drunk men didn\u2019t try to break and enter, they wouldn\u2019t get bit?", "Get rid of her and your brother and change your locks. Block everyone and live peacefully with your dogs. Make sure they didn't step on any glass.

I hope they're at least paying for the broken window, though I doubt their entitled selves would.", "Did you take pictures and evidence of breaking and entering so they can't try to sue you?

And they went to sleep???\n\nThis doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe he went with them to your house and he left from there.\n\nNon of this allows your brother, sil and her brother to use your property as their own.\n\nEven as a guest, what kind of guest breaks the window to someone else's house instead of calling, banging on the door...\n\nThere's something wrong going on here. They all are huge As (forgot to say it in my first comment)", "Let this be a lesson that SIL is not to be trusted. I know that sucks to hear, especially since it sounds like you enjoy seeing your niece, but you need to be so careful moving forward because if anything, literally ANYTHING ever happens again, regardless of fault, your SIL will likely be doing anything in her power to get your dogs removed. You are NTA, but your SIL is a piece of work. I would advise you to not allow her on your property again because after this incident, she is going to be actively looking for ways to get her way.", "YWBTA if SIL and brother are still there.

I really wasn\u2019t sure how to handle it with him, he\u2019s an unusual dog in general and I think the whole thing rattled him a little.

Also her brother wouldn\u2019t stop trying to attack/kicking him after the door was open and I was giving him commands at the same time to back off, so I\u2019m sure it was overwhelming. \n\nHe used to sleep in his dog bed about 10 feet from the front door but every night since the incident he sleeps right under it, like pressed up against the door. I\u2019ve been trying to give him some space, but also he did take a nap with me earlier today which is very unlike him.

And I didn\u2019t even think about trying to get them to pay for the window, I seriously doubt they would.  \n\nThe police were really nice about it, but I was terrified the whole time that they would shoot Toby, since my SIL kept screaming and telling them he was vicious and he did have some blood on his muzzle and chest when they arrived.", ">You should make sure everything is on record with the police in case your family try file a complaint\n\n**This.** \n\nOP, make sure you have photos of the broken window and get a copy of the police report **ASAP**.

Nope.  No.  Bullshit.  Why didn\u2019t he keep knocking at the guest house until they woke up?  Why didn\u2019t he go sit in his car and call them?  Sleep it off in his car?  Knock at your house when the key didn\u2019t work?\n\nThere is no reasonable explanation for the breaking of the window.  None.  This man meant you harm.  Toby did exactly what a guard dog should - he guarded the property.  He let go when you called him off.  He bit an arm and held, he didn\u2019t lung for the throat or bite repeatedly.  It sounds like he\u2019s well trained.  \n\nSo your brother and SIL feel entitled to this house, and you\u2019re a single woman living alone - if you had a home invasion you might feel unsafe anymore living there alone, hrmm?

Screw your horrid entitled family,  protect your fur kids.", "I agree. He already has a difficult time with my SIL, she\u2019s hated him since he was a 12 week old puppy and has always been (in my opinion) overly mean to him.
