{"id": 11179, "submission_id": "11ev2vq", "title": "AITA for not getting rid of my dog after it attacked a family member?", "selftext": "Kind of a convoluted situation, but I\u2019m currently dealing with dozens of angry family members so I could really use some clarity. \n\nI (34F) have six dogs. Five are rescues and very gentle, and one is a 120 lb Akita, Toby, who listens well but isn\u2019t super friendly. It\u2019s a lot, but I have a decently sized home and several acres of property so it\u2019s manageable. \n\nThe problems started a few weeks ago when my brother (32M) and my sister in law (36F) asked to stay in my guest house for a week while they took care of some business. I agreed, especially because then I would get to see my 5 year old niece. \n\nImmediately, my SIL started making negative comments in our group chat and to my mother about my dogs, which I ignored. When my brother and SIL got to my house I gave them a keychain with keys to the guest house and the main house on it just in case. My SIL was still complaining about my dogs but I didn\u2019t think much of it. \n\nWell, about halfway into their stay, I wake up in the middle of the night to my dogs going crazy. The four smaller dogs sleep in their beds in my bedroom, but the two large male dogs sleep by my front door (inside). I\u2019m a single woman living in a very rural area, so I like having them there just in case. \n\nEventually I heard glass break and I was ready to dial 911, but then I heard my SIL\u2019s brother\u2019s (late 30s?) voice. I ran out to my door and see Toby holding on to my SIL\u2019s brother\u2019s arm through the window on my door. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t know what to think and it took me a second to process everything. I would say after about 30 seconds I called Toby off, and he and the other dog both got away from the door. By that time I guess the screaming woke my brother and SIL up and they showed up and started freaking out, and my SIL called an ambulance. What followed was the longest night of my life, getting my SIL\u2019s brother stitched up and talking to several police officers. \n\nI\u2019m still confused about it. According to my SIL, she decided that her brother should stay with them at the guest house (and didn\u2019t tell me?). Then she gave him a key when she saw him in town that day, but accidentally gave him the key to my house instead. When he got in (drunk and at 3am), he tried the guest house, couldn\u2019t get in, and then tried my house, which unlocked the door but not the deadbolt. So that\u2019s when he decided to break the glass and undo the deadbolt from the outside, which led to Toby biting his arm. \n\nNow, my SIL as well as her brother, my mother, and several of my extended family members are insisting that I \u201cget rid of\u201d at least Toby and maybe all of my dogs because I\u2019m \u201ctoo irresponsible to have them\u201d, and that I\u2019m an asshole for refusing. But I bought Toby specifically to keep me safe, and when he thought that a man he didn\u2019t know was breaking into my house, he tried his best to stop it. So I\u2019m really not mad at him for that? \n\nOverall, I\u2019m confused and upset and really need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong here.

I ran out to my door and see Toby holding on to my SIL\u2019s brother\u2019s arm through the window on my door. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t know what to think and it took me a second to process everything. I would say after about 30 seconds I called Toby off, and he and the other dog both got away from the door. By that time I guess the screaming woke my brother and SIL up and they showed up and started freaking out, and my SIL called an ambulance. What followed was the longest night of my life, getting my SIL\u2019s brother stitched up and talking to several police officers. \n\nI\u2019m still confused about it. According to my SIL, she decided that her brother should stay with them at the guest house (and didn\u2019t tell me?). Then she gave him a key when she saw him in town that day, but accidentally gave him the key to my house instead. When he got in (drunk and at 3am), he tried the guest house, couldn\u2019t get in, and then tried my house, which unlocked the door but not the deadbolt. So that\u2019s when he decided to break the glass and undo the deadbolt from the outside, which led to Toby biting his arm. \n\nNow, my SIL as well as her brother, my mother, and several of my extended family members are insisting that I \u201cget rid of\u201d at least Toby and maybe all of my dogs because I\u2019m \u201ctoo irresponsible to have them\u201d, and that I\u2019m an asshole for refusing. But I bought Toby specifically to keep me safe, and when he thought that a man he didn\u2019t know was breaking into my house, he tried his best to stop it. So I\u2019m really not mad at him for that? \n\nOverall, I\u2019m confused and upset and really need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong here.

I don't think there's many things worse that that.\n\nYou need to react OP, you need to take measures.

They want your home and they are willing to go to quite extreme measures to gaslight or assault you out of it. Your dog is your shield right now, which is why they want him gone. Sil is also likely very sore that their initial ill conceived attempt failed. Be wary of escalation. If you start to think you\u2019re going mad, it\u2019s because they are gaslighting you.

Like I said I even muzzle him when she\u2019s around, but he\u2019s overall very gentle with her. Once she stepped on his tail on accident and he just got up and went to his crate. Even after this incident I don\u2019t can\u2019t imagine him hurting her (but I guess everyone says that?).", "And SIL would prob be tickled pink if OP was sued and lost the house. Since her brother was trespassing, a lawsuit would be frivolous but would not be surprised if they tried to get $ out of OP.", "[ Removed by Reddit ]", "I was thinking the same thing, that the SIL is setting OP up. And they probably told the rest of the family a very biased version of what happened.\n\n>if you had a home invasion you might feel unsafe anymore living there alone, hrmm?\n\nEither that, or they would demand that OP gives them the house to make up for so called emotional damage, of course supported by the rest of the family.", "All of this. This is terrifying.\nToby may be a better boi than first realised.", "He did, plus he had to have a serious bath the next morning which he did not enjoy. It\u2019s honestly brought out a side of him I\u2019ve never seen before; he\u2019s usually very independent and relaxed, but he\u2019s been anxious and even a little clingy the past few days. I love him so much and I absolutely hate seeing him stressed like this.", "On the flip side, if your dog is so gosh-darned dangerous, why are they letting their kid anywhere near him? Why is it something only *you* will regret \"when\" he kills her? You are describing responsible ownership of your dogs. They are expecting Toby to \"kill\" Riley yet they still bring the kid around?\n\nAlso, they are playing the whole \"you're not a parent so your thoughts/opinions/choices are less than\" card. As if parenthood somehow makes a person a saint who is always right and perfectly justified. And anyone who isn't comes in at second place.\n\nAll of this is super toxic. If they don't like your dogs they are free to stay the hell away. I feel for you OP.", "He sounds like a fantastic natured dog. He did his job, and by what you've said he's taking it even more seriously now (sleeping right up against the door etc).   \nBut what happened is also traumatic for him, the knocking/smashing in the window, the attack from the intruder, the yelling and screaming from SIL and her brother, the sudden loud noises/lots of people/bright lights when the cops came. That's all very stressful for anyone, let alone a dog. \n\nHe needs a bit of TLC right now and he's also taking care of you - the napping etc. But he has shown his nature, and it's protective. He didn't attack anyone unprovoked. And when he had more than enough opportunity and motive (the yelling and screaming etc) he didn't. He stayed by your side in a defenders role, whilst struggling himself with the stress of it all. \n\nWay to go Toby!", "I wondered about that too. I\u2019m basically their only long-term childcare; they travel a lot for work so I\u2019ve kept Riley for days at a time since she was an infant. I obviously adore her (she\u2019s sole heir in my will) and it\u2019s upsetting me that my family is insinuating I would let Toby hurt her. I\u2019d get rid of Toby in a heartbeat if I thought there was any chance he\u2019s touch her. I love him but I love her more.", "Do SIL and your brother know that Riley is your sole heir?", "Change you locks, change your will. Stop providing childcare.", "They do, I told them when she was born that I\u2019d leave everything to her since I can\u2019t have my own kids. My SIL was upset for a while because she thought I should leave everything to her and my brother but she got over it eventually."]}
