They hooked up in the past?", "INFO did your partner fuck his stepsister?", "Wait what?", "NTA but damn OP, you fucking buried the lede here", "When did they become stepsiblings - as children, teens, or adults?\n\nI mean NTA for being weirded out by the quasi incest but if he's 31, you're 24, and you're being uninvited from his events FOR being weirded out by it... this is probably not a great relationship for you.", "Definitely need more info here. By \u201cdone it\u201d do you mean that these two were having a sexual affair in the house? If so, N T A and get out of there. Because this is his family, which eww. And family isn\u2019t going anywhere and if they\u2019re still close you\u2019ll ALWAYS be wondering.", "Ummmmm.... what? I wouldn't be ok with that. I wouldn't consider their continued relationship as \"stepsiblings\" if they were regularly physically intimate when they were younger. And again... *what*?", "Missing information exactly what kind of relationship did they have? Did they have a brother sister bond? Or did they have an intimate sexual relationship? Can't really judge without this information and your description isn't clear.\n\nEdit after clarification: NTA. They had sex as teenage step siblings. You feel understandably uncomfortable. He is still emotionally close to her. Everything else is above reddit's pay grade. Maybe rethink this relationship.", "Pardon? \n\nExcuse me, I have *several* questions. \n\nReading this stressed me out. I'm going to go have a lay down. \ud83d\ude28", "Ummm you sure they don\u2019t fuck?", "NTA. For me though it has nothing to do with his past. It has to do with him uninviting you because you made a face of disgust. At the end of the day, his step sister is an ex. You are allowed to feel uncomfortable about having to see his ex. The fact that he's defending her over being understanding of your feelings is a red flag.\n\nI do want to say however that there are a lot of comments about how what he did at 19 is a red flag. He can't change that nor can he change the fact that his parent stayed married and thus a relationship with his step sister is unavoidable. Basically if what he did at 19 is a red flag he's f*cked for life and there's nothing he can do to change that. There are a few things that I believe should f*ck you for life (murder, rape, abusing another person) but I don't think a fling with your new roommate is one of them. That said, as mentioned earlier, the part I take issue with is that his actions seem like there may still be something there.", "NTA - If I read that correctly its not so much his stepsister as an ex which makes a huge difference.", "NTA but do you really want to be with a guy who thinks you should be okay with him getting intimate with his step sister and remaining super close to her afterwards?", "You made an ugly face because your guy is planning to spend time with a person he has sex with?  But some how you\u2019re the problem? Why are you with this guy? NTA.  But y w b t a if you stay with a guy who is in a relationship with his sister-girlfriend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a mistake of a bad reaction when he mentioned her", "I saw that movie once", "OP is sure that they did, and that's the problem.", "Lol. The last sentence took me aback too.", "When he told me four months ago, they were ages 17 and 19 under one roof for 3 years. So it was a long time ago and told me it never happened again. I was weirded out at first but eventually moved past it and never asked anything about it anymore.", "Yeah, Op needs to break up with this dude\u2026 or provide more context.\n\nMaybe this was a teenage romance that turned into their parents dating so they cut it off when they got married.\n\nThe other side of the coin, maybe the parents got married and then they started hooking up too. That would be\u2026 pretty nearsighted. OP would be foolish to continue this relauronsho", "OP clarified here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sepsi/comment/jlpdne4/", "That's what he said at the bottom of the post.", "Uh. Yeah. That would be a big red flag. Why the heck would you sleep with your step sister?\n\nDidn\u2019t think about how awkward and odd it would be at every family event from now until their parents die or get divorced? When they have kids with others? Get married?\n\nThe fact that this GF thinks this information is okay and just wants to to be with this guy makes me feel like this is an ESH situation.\n\n\u201cGo hug your aunt Tina. I used to do it all the time with my hips\u201d", "Could we have more context to this? Was it like they met, dated, hooked up, and then parents dated and got married?\n\nDid the parents get married and then the kids hooked up? There are. A lot of red flags here\u2026 was it a one time thing? Did they keep it secret and going for a long time?\n\nTons of missing context but girl, how many red flags do you need?\n\nThe fact that he is excited to see her is odd\u2026", "No, that is a completely reasonable response. It is just like as if he brought a non-familial ex along.\n\nedit: NTA BTW, I would have done the same.", "No that's not a bad reaction, and it's nothing to respect.", "Ma'am, I would not be able to trust my boyfriend with his step sister. I'm sorry, it's just not the same as having an ex. It's *already* a secret he's keeping. It's nothing to keep it some more.", "I watched it a hell of a lot more than once", ">Yes he confided in me which I processed for a quite a time and respected. I had a mistake of a bad reaction when he mentioned her\n\nper OP's comments - so it's not that she thinks. she knows.", "You're going to have to decide exactly how much you trust him and whether or not you'll be okay with who is essentially his ex being not just in his life, but in his family, forever.\n\nI'm, personally, not a jealous person, and am also very lax about sex.  However, I feel like even I would not like this much.  I've hooked up with several of my friends and have never gotten weird about it, but this is different (looking past the fact she's his step-sister for the purpose of what I'm fixin to say.) He's likely to spend holidays, etc. with/around her and his parents and other family members already know and love her.  They've cohabitated and remained tight, so they've already had that experience and know it works.  These are facts which will be IN YOUR FACE for many, if not most, family gatherings, and in the back of your mind the rest of the time.  Are you always going to be okay with their friendship and the fact they say, \"I love you,\" or will you (or do you already) feel uncomfortable each text exchange?\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this.  It's often difficult to find out about your partner's questionable past; it's much more difficult to find out his past is also his present and future.", "Personally, theres no saving this one. Your never gona be ok with it (rightfully so). Husbands gona always feel 'judged'. I mean, C'mon.. \n\nAnd he still gets giddy excited to see her? Its only a matter of time before your back here with some insane horror story\n\n\"AITA for being angry I caught them in our bed\" \n\nI know its jumping to an extreme accusation. And i do NOT wish that for you Op. But, this uh. This one you gotta be careful with, care for yourself please, trust your gut.", "They were raised as *siblings*. They lived as *siblings*. Step or not.\n\nNothing about this is ok, at all.\n\nNTA btw.", "Either they are siblings, and that would be a giant red flag, even if it allows for them to stay in contact and say \"I love you.\" If it's because they moved in at the end, then he is talking about his ex girlfriend that he used to live with and still, consistently, talks affectionately towards her. Which would make it a red flag now, more so than before.", "I thought she meant living together secretly for years \ud83d\ude02. She can\u2019t even bring herself to say they fuck.\nRUN, OP.", "Father side: The dad re-married, the stepmom has a child (his stepsister). They all lived together eventually. He told me it happened quite several times secretly so yeah hitting me again now that I\u2019ve told reddit \n\nMother side is different but North America just got its own stepfamily as family thing", "Oh yes true. \ud83e\udee0\ud83d\ude2d", "Not saying it isn't weird but they were not raised as siblings... They didn't even grow up together.", "Gross to the max NTA", "Uh. Yeah, that\u2019s a flag. Did they start and stop as teens? How old were they?\n\nYou need to find a new man\u2026 this isn\u2019t normal behavior.", "NTA-Yeah, they probably still hook up. \n\nWhich is why he immediately jumped to uninviting you.  I\u2019m sure when he visits his dad, Him and step sis will go on a little walk to \u201c catch up\u201d."]}
