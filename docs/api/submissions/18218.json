He can't change that nor can he change the fact that his parent stayed married and thus a relationship with his step sister is unavoidable. Basically if what he did at 19 is a red flag he's f*cked for life and there's nothing he can do to change that. There are a few things that I believe should f*ck you for life (murder, rape, abusing another person) but I don't think a fling with your new roommate is one of them.
