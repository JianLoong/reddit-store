Can't really judge without this information and your description isn't clear.\n\nEdit after clarification: NTA. They had sex as teenage step siblings. You feel understandably uncomfortable.

It has to do with him uninviting you because you made a face of disgust. At the end of the day, his step sister is an ex. You are allowed to feel uncomfortable about having to see his ex. The fact that he's defending her over being understanding of your feelings is a red flag.\n\nI do want to say however that there are a lot of comments about how what he did at 19 is a red flag. He can't change that nor can he change the fact that his parent stayed married and thus a relationship with his step sister is unavoidable. Basically if what he did at 19 is a red flag he's f*cked for life and there's nothing he can do to change that. There are a few things that I believe should f*ck you for life (murder, rape, abusing another person) but I don't think a fling with your new roommate is one of them. That said, as mentioned earlier, the part I take issue with is that his actions seem like there may still be something there.", "NTA - If I read that correctly its not so much his stepsister as an ex which makes a huge difference.", "NTA but do you really want to be with a guy who thinks you should be okay with him getting intimate with his step sister and remaining super close to her afterwards?", "You made an ugly face because your guy is planning to spend time with a person he has sex with?

However, I feel like even I would not like this much.  I've hooked up with several of my friends and have never gotten weird about it, but this is different (looking past the fact she's his step-sister for the purpose of what I'm fixin to say.) He's likely to spend holidays, etc. with/around her and his parents and other family members already know and love her.  They've cohabitated and remained tight, so they've already had that experience and know it works.  These are facts which will be IN YOUR FACE for many, if not most, family gatherings, and in the back of your mind the rest of the time.  Are you always going to be okay with their friendship and the fact they say, \"I love you,\" or will you (or do you already) feel uncomfortable each text exchange?\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this.
