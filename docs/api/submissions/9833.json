I'm posting because I've got people telling me I was genuinely in the wrong here\n\nSo last week me, my friends 'Alice' and 'Tara', as well as Tara's cousin 'Kate' were meant to go clubbing together. Tara was sick on the day so she couldn't make it, and the 3 of us went. I don't know Kate very well- I've seen her sometimes at Tara's place but that's about it, because she's plain, usually kind of quiet and shy (honestly didn't think clubbing was her thing).\n\nI heard Kate got married but I had no idea what her husband looked like. Neither did Alice.\n\nAfter a bit Kate got pretty drunk. She actually didn't have that many drinks but I guess her alcohol tolerance is low. She was having a hard time even standing upright and incoherent, so me and Alice took her to sit down. I thought we could call someone from Kate's phone but it was obviously locked, so Alice called Tara and told her the situation. She said she couldn't come, but she'd text Kate's husband 'Alex'.\n\nNow the thing is, we were talking pretty loudly to hear over the music, so anyone around could've heard the info that the drunk girl's name was Kate and her husband's Alex.\n\nAfter a bit a pretty polished, good-looking guy comes up saying he's Alex, Kate's husband. I had a bit of a hard time believing that so I asked if he had any proof? He eventually showed his lock screen, which was a picture of Kate from their wedding, but by herself and he wasn't in it. Alice went to stay that's okay and he can take Kate, but I said I would rather see a photo of them together. He got pissed and eventually managed to show a photo, and after I called Tara to confirm, he and Kate left.\n\nI didn't think much of it, but the next day Kate texted (kind of passive aggressive) saying thanks for helping her, but \"why the hell I made such a big deal in front of everyone\".\n\nTara and Alice are also saying I went overboard but I don't think so.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676261249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110yygf/aita_for_asking_a_guy_for_proof_when_he_came_to/", "score": 545, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had a bit of a **hard time believing that**\n\nI went into this thinking it would be \"overbearing friend in protection mode\" not \"thinks friend is too boring to have an attractive husband.\"", "YTA... His lock screen was his wife on their wedding day. You sound like you were just jealous he was her husband to be completely honest.", "YTA\n\nI 100% think you should check on who's coming to pick up a drunk young woman. We all know what can happen. \n\nBut this is why you're AH:\n\n1. The guy came up and mentioned both his name and Kate's. I personally think the chances someone around you hearing that info and coming up saying it is low, because as you even say the music was loud. How many people even heard? But say you're correct and it wasn't actually Kate's husband, let's move on\n2. He showed a photo of Kate which was his lock screen. I think it's fairly normal to have your partner's photo as a lock screen, but that wasn't enough for you (although Alice was okay with it). Fine, let's say this guy is actually a stalker who happens to have her *wedding photo* as his lock screen. Moving on\n3. He shows a photo of the two of them together, *then* you just have to call Tara to confirm, *then* you let her go. This was completely unnecessary, he literally showed you pictures of him and Kate together. If you really wanted to call Tara why didn't you ask her to text you a description of what he looked like, or even his photo, earlier?\n4. What really tells me AH is the fact you mention Alex as a \"polished, good-looking\" guy. How is this relevant to the post? If you'd said something like, 'the guy that came looked really drunk himself, I got bad vibes' etc, at least that would make more sense.\n5. Coupled with your comment that Kate is \"plain, quiet and shy\", I think you're jealous she got the \"polished, good-looking husband\"", "Info: was Kate unconscious at this point?  Even completely wasted, I\u2019d trust a drunk person to confirm whether a 3rd party is their husband or bf.", "YTA. Looking after your companion is honorable, but your went further than reason dictated. He showed up, knowing her name *and his* and you picked a fight with him. That\u2019s a bit much.", "YTA you sound obnoxious and jealous", "[deleted]", "YTA because you called her plain yet he was good looking and polished?? I hope she finds this.", "YTA - This man was texted to come, shows up and seeks y'all out by name. That should have been enough. How the heck would he have known if he wasn't the person texted to come get her? This isn't a potential case if getting into a car that wasn't actually an Uber. You went at least two steps into paranoia land.", "INFO\n\nHow hard of a time did you give him, and how long did this ID check last? I think if the whole interaction with Alex lasted less than 2 minutes, they\u2019re definitely overreacting and being unappreciative for your looking out.\n\nBut on the off-chance you really gave him an exceedingly hard time (e.g., insisted on a couples photo and wouldn\u2019t look at his drivers license), then I could see their point.", "Were you concerned for your friend\u2019s safety or did you just not believe she could have a \u201cpolished, good looking\u201d husband?

I understand you were maybe thinking a random could have jumped on the idea of taking your drunk friend \u201chome\u201d and that was your reason for checking, but in that event it would be extremely unlikely for them to spot your drunk friend and then find a picture of them from elsewhere to pretend to be Alex.\n\nI understand your intentions and they were good, but from the husbands perspective I can understand why he\u2019d be annoyed. \n\n\nBare in mind, he doesn\u2019t know you either.", "Yta, if you really wanted to be sure she was going to the right person you probably could of found them on social media before he got there or ask them to send picture so you\u2019d know who to look for but having to call Tara after him showing you a wedding photo was doing to much", "YTA\n\nEver hear of asking Kate who he was??? What a strange thing to do. lmao, if some stranger I didn't know demanded I \"show her proof\" that I was my wife's husband, I would have walked right past her and collected my wife to take her home.", "YTA - why not just ask for ID if you wanted to verify? I\u2019m assuming they\u2019d have the same address, last name. \n\nBut you think a guy randomly overheard you *in a club*, googled to get her wedding photo and switched it to his Lock Screen and answer questions for 15 mins just to take advantage.\n\nAnd the only reason why you questioned it was because you didn\u2019t think Kate (who you don\u2019t know well) would be married to a good-looking polished guy.\n\nEirher this didn\u2019t happen, you\u2019re just dumb or jealous.", "It's good that you were looking out for her, but why would he have a picture of her on his lock screen if he was just some random guy who had overhead your conversation and decided to pretend to be Alex? Where would he have gotten that picture?\n\nThe first picture should have been enough. You didn't have to push it further.", "YTA.\n\nCheck who he is, sure, but you think there's any chance that some random guy who's trying to kidnap Kate has a picture of her in her wedding dress as his lock screen? Let's have a bit of perspective here...", "YTA\n\nLet's be honest here, this wasn't about you thinking he was a danger to her. This was about you thinking that she is too \"plain\" as you put it for such a \"polished good looking guy\" \n\nYou were shocked that she actually has a good looking husband and couldn't believe that he would actually be attracted to her because you don't think she's pretty. \n\nNot only were you warned that he would be coming  and given his name, he came and identified himself. He assumed correctly that Tara had already given you the information needed so he could go get his wife. \n\nHe showed you a pic of her on his lock screen in her gown yet you still didn't believe him\n\nHe showed you pics of them together at their wedding yet you still didn't believe him\n\nYou're jealous aren't you? Bet you 100 bucks you think you're hot shit and more deserving of him than his \"plain\" wife.\n\nYTA asshole", "YTA. I would have also asked to see a picture of them together but the fact that you called her plain and that you said that you had a hard time believing that the good looking guy was the husband really told me that you did the ID Check out of jealousy and not protectiveness", "YTA \n\nYou mostly didn't believe he was her husband because he's too good looking to be with her", "YTA - Why would you assume that he'd have a photo of them together on his phone at all?

This tests if the person is safe. If they produce the ID no problem, they have nothing to hide. Stalling or refusing is a red flag. Added to that, if things go south, you have a name to give the police, even if it was a fake ID.\n\n2. If you are coordinating a pick up with someone you haven't met before, ask your friend to send a picture. Or text you a safe word that the person will use when picking up your friend.\n\n3. If someone is suddenly extremely intoxicated after only a couple drinks, suspect that something was slipped into their drink. Get that person to a safe location and start getting them to drink water. Consider calling an ambulance.\n\n4. Before you start drinking, make sure you have access to everyone's emergency contact numbers.
