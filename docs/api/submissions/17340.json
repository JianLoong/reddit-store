Final decision.", "NTA\n\nYour housing situation doesn\u2019t allow for your parents to stay over.

Your parents may be from families where you never stay at a hotel if you have a floor to crash on--this is a fine budget philosophy if you have *willing family* who can host you--but throw some roommates into the mix and it's game over.

Your parents should had plan better if they want to spend time with you. Don't let them overstep your boundaries and wishes. A week with your parents trying to take up your space? That's too much.
