Final decision.", "NTA\n\nYour housing situation doesn\u2019t allow for your parents to stay over. It\u2019s not just your space, it belongs to your housemates too and if they don\u2019t feel comfortable with it then there\u2019s nothing you can do.

Your parents may be from families where you never stay at a hotel if you have a floor to crash on--this is a fine budget philosophy if you have *willing family* who can host you--but throw some roommates into the mix and it's game over.
