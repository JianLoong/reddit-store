I love my family, but I wasn\u2019t too excited about having to explain to my family over and over again that I was laid off and what I was doing and everything. I was going to maybe see if I could get away with telling them after Thanksgiving, or maybe tell some people individually. \n\nI brought this up to my mother and she had a couple helpful suggestions, which was great.

For the life of me I can\u2019t understand why your aunt and uncle would be \u201cpressing\u201d her for information about your job and even if they were, why at this time? No what was pressing was her inability to keep a secret. Your busy is your business. Period. What if you went telling people something you knew about her in confidence? I bet you can\u2019t because people who don\u2019t keep secrets keep theirs to themselves. This may be a lesson learned to not divulge to her anything you don\u2019t want to get out. Maybe she\u2019ll learn to keep secrets. As for family, go to Thanksgiving and shut down anyone who asks. Politely tell them you are weighing your options and change the subject.

Their opinion that \"as it's family it doesn't count\" only matters if it's their secret they are telling to you and want you to keep under their conditions. Your mother can't agree to keep a secret for you, then without asking you decide for herself that it's okay to tell Tom, Dick, and Harry.\n\nBesides, if their position is that regardless of what you think they will decide who it's okay to tell your private information to, and agreeing to keep something a secret doesn't change that, they are very obviously untrustworthy. They will do what they want and be unapologetic about it, even if they have directly gone against their word. If that's not untrustworthy, what is?\n\nThey don't want to wear a label that describes their behavior because that would mean having to face up to the shame of the fact that they did breach your trust. Their defense is getting offended and making excuses instead of apologizing. Not a good look, and a strong hint that they need to go on an information diet.", "NTA .
