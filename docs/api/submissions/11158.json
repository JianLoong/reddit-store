So much NTA. \n\nAs others have said, it's YOUR dress that YOUR late-partner selected for YOU. \n\nIt doesn't matter that sister has her heart 'set on the dress', it's yours.

It's not a malicious request.\n\nWhile I think that holding on to a dress for your son isn't likely to be something he ends up appreciating, I also don't think you're in the wrong for not wanting that dress to be used. It's your dress and you can choose how it gets used, or if it gets used. Nothing wrong with wanting to preserve it.\n\nNothing wrong with either party here. I understand your family's confusion at saving a dress for your son (and don't find it terribly likely that any future partner will want to wear a decades-old dress), and can understand why they're giving you pushback. At the same time, though, it's your dress and your decision how it should be used, and their confusion is immaterial to whether you want it to be used or not. You don't need to justify your decision. The dress and its meaning is yours.", "NTA \n\nShe should never have asked to wear it.

Thank you for respecting me.\"", "NTA She asked, you answered. Everyone needs to accept the answer and move on.", "NTA.\n\nYour life, your artifacts of memory, your decision. Sis can get her own wedding dress, and her trying to invalidate your personal grieving and coping for her own financial benefit is downright ghoulish.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur mom is an AH for guilting you. Stop second guessing your decission, and keep up your boundary.", "NTA. I think what you are saving that dress for is beautiful in itself. I\u2019m sure your child will think so too when he\u2019s older. There are millions of wedding dresses to choose from. She doesn\u2019t need that one.", "I feel like you under reacted to your mother saying\n\n\"You should be happy that someone will actually get to walk down the aisle in your dress.\"\n\n\nWTF?   THOSE WORDS RIGHT THERE WOULD SEVER THE RELATIONSHIP I HAD WITH MY MOTHER. \n\nI would have replied \"I should be happy? Is that your justification to let her use my dress, because it hasn't been worn due to my fiance dying?  He picked that for me to wear, but because he died, I should just hand it over?  He got me pregnant before he died as well, if sis can't have kids, should I just hand over my son too?\"\n\n\nYour sister 4 years ago saw your loss as your gain, and she could ask about the dress, but the fact that she refused to respect your answer and employed your mom to take it further shows that she doesn't give two shits about you, your fiance, your son, or your loss.\n\n\nYou need to hide that at your MILs home somewhere\n\n\nYour sister and mother would totally steal it\n\n\n\nNTA", "No no no no no.

Offer to go raid the 2nd hand shops with sis and see if you can find something cool.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister had her heart set on a free dress. \n\nYou bought the dress - you are free to do with it what you want. If you want to save it for your son (or his future partner) you can do that. I actually think that's a lovely idea. \n\nThe dress isn't upset that it hasn't been worn down the aisle. Actually, how are we to know that it hasn't already been worn, since you bought it at a thrift shop?", "NTA.  The dress has huge sentimental value to you and your sister has zero right to set her heart on wearing it. Your sister should be ashamed of herself trying to guilt you out of it.

I tried to say this earlier, but you said it better. It was bizarre and rude for the sister to even ask.", "I have a feeling that \u2018free\u2019 is the key word here. It seems more plausible for her dream is to get a cheap, or better yet free but good quality dress that can be altered to be perfect for her. Once alterations have been made, Faith can say \u201coh no, I thought you wouldn\u2019t mind. Well, too late now.\u201d \n\nNTA at all", "Do this! Even if you don\u2019t think your mother or sister would steal the dress.

NTA, definitely NTA OP", "I don't think sister was wrong to ask. Sister was wrong to not accept \"no\" as the answer.", "Thank you, I hope he'll think that too. I wish I could give him more than just a dress and memories, but I'm glad he'll be able to have a connection to his dad through something he found beauty in when he was here.", "Honestly that statement about \"someone actually getting to walk down the aisle in the dress\" hurt me more than anything but for my own sanity I didn't even want to touch on it. My mom saw first hand how broken I was after he died, and honestly if it weren't for the fact that I was pregnant, I would have given up completely.", "OPs sister saw her sister lose her fiance and was like \"sweet, I can have the dress.\"  She was totally looking at it as her sisters loss was her gain.", "Also the \u201cShould be happy that someone I\u2019ll get to walk down the aisle in the dress\u201d comment is possibly one of the most disgusting things I\u2019ve seen on here.

I\u2019d take some time away from them all and reconsider their roles in your life.", "They are your family as well as it is their grandchild you are holding onto the dress for.    You said the MIL had the dress preserved for the future. She may care that the seal is going to be broken if your sister gets a hold of this dress.", "Yes, let your MIL keep the dress until after the wedding, if not longer. Your family has shown that they refuse to respect NO. Don't give them any opportunity to disrespect you further.\n\nYou are NTA. Not by a long shot. Your family is incredibly so.", "Then you need to find a different place. \n\nHonestly I think your MIL would be more upset if it was stolen and altered by your sister than protecting it from your entitled family.", "Sis should have never set her heart on OPs wedding dress.", "Honestly, I think sister was, if not wrong, then at the very least clueless to ask. How do you ask for what's obviously a precious memento? The wedding dress was something OP's fianc\u00e9 loved and wanted OP to wear, not her sister. And how could seeing someone wear the dress the OP would have worn if her fianc\u00e9 hadn't been killed be anything but painful? \n\nThis is a sentimental, not a practical situation. I'd never, ever even consider asking my sister to let me wear the dress her fianc\u00e9 had dreamed of her wearing.", "Yeah. If OP had felt positively about seeing the dress being worn by her sister, it would have been a lovely arrangement. I don\u2019t see a problem with asking.", "That was literally the highlight of my comment.\n\n\nLike what if her sister can't have a kid, should OP hand over her kid cause sis has a husband?", "Never ever.

A dress *his* mother preserved for *you* after his death. \n\nThat\u2019s an unspeakably cruel thing to ask of you.
