She's into vintage fashion, and she said she really loved the style of the dress and pointed out that it was probably worth more than my fianc\u00e9 paid for it. Its possible that the driving factor behind her having \"her heart set on it\" is because it happens to fit into her interests but I don't know.\n\nAlso, my son and I visit my MIL almost every weekend, so I might just bring the dress over there with me and ask her to keep it for me.", "created_utc": 1677612679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ehiv1/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_wear_my/", "score": 2547, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not a malicious request.\n\nWhile I think that holding on to a dress for your son isn't likely to be something he ends up appreciating, I also don't think you're in the wrong for not wanting that dress to be used. It's your dress and you can choose how it gets used, or if it gets used. Nothing wrong with wanting to preserve it.\n\nNothing wrong with either party here. I understand your family's confusion at saving a dress for your son (and don't find it terribly likely that any future partner will want to wear a decades-old dress), and can understand why they're giving you pushback. At the same time, though, it's your dress and your decision how it should be used, and their confusion is immaterial to whether you want it to be used or not. You don't need to justify your decision. The dress and its meaning is yours.", "NTA \n\nShe should never have asked to wear it.

THOSE WORDS RIGHT THERE WOULD SEVER THE RELATIONSHIP I HAD WITH MY MOTHER. \n\nI would have replied \"I should be happy?

He got me pregnant before he died as well, if sis can't have kids, should I just hand over my son too?\"\n\n\nYour sister 4 years ago saw your loss as your gain, and she could ask about the dress, but the fact that she refused to respect your answer and employed your mom to take it further shows that she doesn't give two shits about you, your fiance, your son, or your loss.\n\n\nYou need to hide that at your MILs home somewhere\n\n\nYour sister and mother would totally steal it\n\n\n\nNTA", "No no no no no.

If you want to save it for your son (or his future partner) you can do that. I actually think that's a lovely idea. \n\nThe dress isn't upset that it hasn't been worn down the aisle.

I wish I could give him more than just a dress and memories, but I'm glad he'll be able to have a connection to his dad through something he found beauty in when he was here.", "Honestly that statement about \"someone actually getting to walk down the aisle in the dress\" hurt me more than anything but for my own sanity I didn't even want to touch on it. My mom saw first hand how broken I was after he died, and honestly if it weren't for the fact that I was pregnant, I would have given up completely.", "OPs sister saw her sister lose her fiance and was like \"sweet, I can have the dress.\"  She was totally looking at it as her sisters loss was her gain.", "Also the \u201cShould be happy that someone I\u2019ll get to walk down the aisle in the dress\u201d comment is possibly one of the most disgusting things I\u2019ve seen on here.

I\u2019d take some time away from them all and reconsider their roles in your life.", "They are your family as well as it is their grandchild you are holding onto the dress for.    You said the MIL had the dress preserved for the future. She may care that the seal is going to be broken if your sister gets a hold of this dress.", "Yes, let your MIL keep the dress until after the wedding, if not longer. Your family has shown that they refuse to respect NO. Don't give them any opportunity to disrespect you further.\n\nYou are NTA. Not by a long shot. Your family is incredibly so.", "Then you need to find a different place. \n\nHonestly I think your MIL would be more upset if it was stolen and altered by your sister than protecting it from your entitled family.", "Sis should have never set her heart on OPs wedding dress.", "Honestly, I think sister was, if not wrong, then at the very least clueless to ask. How do you ask for what's obviously a precious memento? The wedding dress was something OP's fianc\u00e9 loved and wanted OP to wear, not her sister. And how could seeing someone wear the dress the OP would have worn if her fianc\u00e9 hadn't been killed be anything but painful? \n\nThis is a sentimental, not a practical situation.

If OP had felt positively about seeing the dress being worn by her sister, it would have been a lovely arrangement. I don\u2019t see a problem with asking.", "That was literally the highlight of my comment.\n\n\nLike what if her sister can't have a kid, should OP hand over her kid cause sis has a husband?", "Never ever.

If she wanted to share a special moment with you she could invite you to do something together for her wedding, not try to rob you off of anything of yours regardless of its value, be it sentimental, or monetary, or both.\n\nNTA", "Tell them to get stuffed. You are not can not and should not be forced to hand over your clothing - especially not such a super personal one with such a tragic history-to your relatives for recycling of your dreams. NTA obviously! You are more than right to gatekeep your memory and it\u2019s keepsakes! Your family though- and that intrusive, rude sister are complete AH", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Our mom called me and said that my sister is hurt because she had her heart set on that dress, and she wanted to share this special moment with me.\n\nIt's not her dress. It's not even a dress that was passed down through the family. It's weird for her to have her heart set on it, and even weirder that she would think she's entitled to it.\n\nAlso, I always thought that when it comes to sentimental clothing, you don't demand, you wait for the person to offer?\n\nIn any case, your sister is being a ghoul.", "NTA. Ignoring all other factors, it\u2019s your wedding dress and you can do with it whatever you like. She has no right to it.", "Defo defo take it to your MIL. NTA", "NTA. Your family is being weird as hell about this. I'm sorry for your loss.", ">The baby is a boy (he\u2019s 4 now), so I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be wearing the dress but if he does that\u2019s fine lol.\nIs\nOp you're such a good mother", "NTA, can I offer a suggestion? Maybe your sister could have a dress made with pictures of your dress? I don't know if a dressmaker can make something from a photo.", "Imagine having your heart set on your sister's dress for a wedding she couldn't have because her fiance died, which is also the only thing she has to hand down to their child in memory of their father. Yoh. NTA.", "NTA and don't give in, they are being TA if they understand the context of the situation and still feel entitled to it, it's not her dress.  \n\nYou don't owe her that dress, it wasn't picked for her, she has no right to it, and if she were a good sister she wouldn't be putting her superficial desires over what it means for her sister and what it might mean for her nephew someday.", "NTA, ensure that the dress is somewhere safe they can't touch it, make sure to inform them that you will report it stolen if it goes missing or they try and use it.", "NTA, since when did anyone have to hand over their possessions just because someone else 'has their heart set on it'? And a very special, treasured possession, at that.", "NTA The audacity!!!! Your fianc\u00e9e chose this dress and bought it for you, what you choose to do with it is nobody's business but yours. Sis wants a free dress and your family are being entitled af. Next time they start their shenanigans, just tell them \"no\". You've explained once, which is more than you needed to. They asked, you answered, the conversation is over.", "NTA\n\nYour sister could find a similar dress to buy or have one made.  It sounds like she hasn't even tried to find another dress and is fixated on raking yours.  That's extremely selfish of her.\n\nAlso, you may eventually offer the dress to your son's future wife or to your granddaughter.  But, if not, there's nothing wrong with keeping the dress as a remembrance and not letting anyone wear it.\n\nIf your mother or sister know where you keep your dress, it may be a good idea to hide it elsewhere until your sister's wedding is over.  There have multiple posts on Reddit about someone intentionally stealing or ruining a dress.", "NTA NTA NTA. You\u2019re family is wrong for trying to pressure you. The dress is understandably very special to you and it is up to you and only you what happens with it.", "NTA - what about your feelings? Watching someone walking around in the dress your fianc\u00e9 picked for you. I am the hell no camp.", "NTA. It\u2019s sentimental to you, and that\u2019s all that matters", "NTA \n\nIt was insensitive of her to even ask, but to get other family members in on it too is just super A  H of all of them.", "NTA. These people need to realize that this is not \"just a dress\" this is something of unreplacable value to you. It is the physical keepsake of your husbands memory to you. If anything would happen to it on the wedding you'd be broken. I wouldn't even want to risk it as your sister tbh (I am a male, but I really think I couldn't). I see no reason how her wanting to wear YOUR dress goes above your need to have this keepsake.", "No, NTA at slightest. If I was that child it would meant a world to me. It's ultimate \"prove\" of love from his father to his mom. Sister can take her manipulation and shove it. She just wanna save the money. Don't budge. Let the MIL know about the situation, so she couldn't be tricked into giving the dress to anybody. If your sister loves the dress so much send her photos so she could have it sewn. If you \"lend\" the dress you will never see it again.", "NTA", "NTA.  The response from your sister and everyone agreeing with her is fucking ghoulish, I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, and I'm sorry for your loss, OP.", "Are you freaking kidding me ? NTA!! Your family however Wow!! Do not buckle,  and yes get the dress to MIL now !\nIt's not unfortunate you never got to wear it.. you lost your finance and your son lost his father.. how dare ANYONE think they get to ask for it... \nI know you said your finance didn't have much to share with your son, not true.. He has your love and his families love and you can all keep him alive in your sons heart and soul by sharing stories and precious memories..maybe in start a journal of all your memories so none are forgotten.  I'm sorry for your loss..stay fierce mumma bear x", "Holy f---\n\nSuper mega ultra hyper NTA!!!\n\nI am so sorry for your loss and the compounding by your family. Your child's grandmother is a wonderful woman.", "NTA, but boy your sister and mom sure are.   You are not obligated to lend/give the dress to anyone and for them to say anything other than ok after you say no is just wrong.   Your best tactic now is the use the dead stare whenever the dress is brought up and then just walk away.  The more your sister/mom push, the faster you walk.   Try not to stoop down to their level of bullying.   If you feel like you must say something, \u201cI told you no, you need to accept my answer.  This is not up for debate\u201d.    You can actually repeat that to anyone who thinks they can weigh in.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for you loss, I\u2019m sure you feel it every day.", "This is the first time I've ever thought \"I really enjoyed reading that Reddit comment\"", "OP, put all your memories in a book. Start writing a journal whenever something pops in your mind. Sometimes a flower, a song, a holiday trigger certain memories. Sit down and write them down, no order or so needed. I think your son would treasure it when he gets older. Especially since certain everyday memories will fade over time (while others stick forever). Favourite colour, how you met, your first dispute about something silly, you know, everything...", "NTA. You\u2019re son can use the fabric from the dress to make a shirt or etc for his wedding day/any other day.
