I don't know why felt the need to put that out there when it could cause a rift between you and your sister.

This isn't hiding infidelity or traumatic family secrets from your spouse. This is info that serves to benefit literally no one, but it does make your sister feel embarrassed.

So if that's not wanted, then it means that neither of the two should be seeked out for a private conversation. \n\nPersonally I don't operate like that with my partner.

There were no extenuating circumstances that called for him being told either, based on the information available.\n\nThe stepsister was open about it with people she trusted and had the expectation that it would not get back to OP's husband.

Even if it's minor and doesn't affect things, OP has proven she doesn't respect her stepsister's privacy.\n\nAgain, a lot of people who you *trust to keep a secret* knowing said secret does not mean it's okay to tell someone else without permission.  There are plenty of things you are willing to share with certain groups of people but not other groups or individuals. There are things you'll tell your friends but not your coworkers.
