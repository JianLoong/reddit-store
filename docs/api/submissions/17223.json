Hmmmm\u2026.", "INFO: How does the drunk friend know?", "NTA, Little gossip like this happens constantly throughout families & friend groups. Secrets are very rarely kept and giving the time frame at which this one was revealed it is so insignificant to your stepsisters life at this point.\n\nIt's best to not tell people other things like this because people get embarresed. However, if someone doesnt want someone to know something they it's best kept to themselves.\n\nConsidering it is your husband, I doubt he cares either.", "NTA. Sounds to me like your stepsister is embarrassed that she still has a crush, tho. Just a hunch.", "NTA", "NTA, and the only reason you\u2019re NTA here is because this is your husband. The person in whom you are allowed to confide ANYTHING. \n\nThis is just an understanding I have with every one of my guy friends. No one is required to keep any secret from their spouse. Also, what about this friend who coughed it up when drunk?

Was she being flirty with him and he was oblivious to it so you wanted to make him aware so he can shut her down?", "YTA. What was the point of telling him? Thankfully he didn\u2019t care, BUT what if it went the other way? What if he became uncomfortable being around her? And of course it was going to get back to your stepsister, once something is out, it grows legs and runs around everywhere. I feel your stepsister has the right to be angry.

Idk I don't see how this is at all beneficial to talk about other than to make their relationship more strained. As long as she isn't making problems in your relationship, there was no reason to bring it up.", "I learned too late that it's best to assume that married people tell each stuff.  Don't tell a married person anything you don't want their spouse to know.", "YTA. It's none of his business and she clearly didn't want him to know.

So you basically broke her trust just because.\n\nPeople are saying he's your husband, so you should be able to confide everything to him... that does NOT include other people's secrets. A secret someone feels comfortable sharing with you doesn't mean they're comfortable sharing it with your husband. Your stepsister trusted you to keep her confidence in the matter and you didn't. \n\nAlso the drunk friend sucks too, she had no right to do that either and also broke trust.", "YTA don\u2019t share info that isn\u2019t yours to share. Especially if this was told in confidence. It\u2019s a huge breach or trust and honestly OP, you\u2019re a bit of a shitty friend and sister for this. Sure this is a small bit of gossip and not that big of a deal to you but I imagine your stepsister won\u2019t tell you anything big and nor will your female friends for that matter if you\u2019re not even able to keep that.", "YTA\n\nI think the problem lies is that you told your sister's personal information without her consent and you did so casually that you don't find any fault in yourself.\n\nFor example just because you don't think it's a problem giving someone's number your number to a person who like you, doesn't mean other people don't see it as a violation of privacy. \n\nLike just because you don't think that your sister having a crush on your husband in the past was embarrassing, doesn't mean that she doesn't find it humiliating. Truthfully it would ruin a friendship ship for me if my friend knew i had a silly crush on them. \n\nI was your sister i wouldn't trust you as much as before, but i wouldn't cut contact as it was with bad intentions.", "I can't decide NAH or ESH.\n\nSister - The younger your sister is when this was revealed, the more embarrassing it would be for her.  If she is in her thirties or something, I think this is kind of an overreaction.  Also, it sounds like her friends had already picked up on it, so it's not a big shocking surprise to anyone probably.\n\nYou - You could consider it a violation of someone's confidence (if she swore you to secrecy)\n\nHusband - kind of an AH for revealing that you told him.  I don't know why felt the need to put that out there when it could cause a rift between you and your sister.  He sounds like the type of person who doesn't keep a secret well either.\n\nFriend - Who brings up stuff like this, unless they are still in middle school or something.", "YTA. Regardless of who knew what and when, hubby will never look at SIL again without wondering if there is a sexual attraction he needs to play defense on. Was the hug a little too tight, a little too long? That touch- innocent or inappropriate? \n\nY\u2019all remember the one a few weeks ago where the husband was locking himself in the bedroom because MIL and SIL were coming over for dinner 4 times a week and SIL is \u201cjust a hugger\u201d? That\u2019s the next step of this YTA to your husband. You just made your husband uncomfortable and about a situation he can never control.", "I just don\u2019t get why you would tell him? Why would it matter that she had a crush on him years ago? It just seems kind of petty that you would mention it.", "NTA as it was rather innocuous information but don\u2019t be upset if she no longer confides in you.  I love my friends but I learned the hard way which ones gossip to their spouses and which ones don\u2019t, it does affect who I go to when I need advice.", "NTA, and honestly, OH WELL,  it's her problem and not yours. Evidently, everyone knows about her crush on him.  His friend knew and told him, so she still has a crush on him.  Stop apologizing to her.  You would be the one to be pissed off about this anyway, not her.", "YTA. I don\u2019t like women who pillow talk about their friends business with their SOs. It\u2019s not a good look.", "YTA for humiliating your stepsister.  Your friend was also an AH.", "But did you need to tell your husband?", "YTA.\n\nRule of thumb - is what you're about to say true?  Is it kind?  Is it necessary?  If it isn't all three of those things, it probably should just be left unsaid.  What value was there in telling him?\n\nSure, it seems harmless and luckily it seems like your husband is a decent guy who isn't going to make fun of your stepsister or let it interfere in their relationship as BIL/SIL.  But did it need to be said?  What was necessary about breaking your stepsister's confidence and telling your husband this information about her?", "NTA. I can see why she'd be a bit embarrassed but it was long ago and doesn't really affect anything.", "NTA, let's be real here, if this were a \"crush\" that happened \"years\" ago she'd have been able to laugh this little shit off.

It's shame.", "I tell my husband EVERYTHING, we don't keep much from each other and he loves a good little gossip with me (we never talk about anything we talk about in these little sessions but ourselves) so I don't think what you did was bad.

Also it s kinda embarrassing but to this level that she angry at you. Nta", "Eh, YTA. It's never nice to gossip.", "YTA, as long as she was never inappropriate with him, there was no need for him to know that. I would be mega embarrassed if someone I had a crush on as a child knew about it, and it would be a major betrayal if they were told by someone I trusted. It seems like you literally only told him for laughs, which is cruel.

Or did she know him through you and had a crush when you were already dating?", "YTA", "Ehhhhhhh. It's not that deep or unforgivable, but I can see your sister feeling like it was a bit of a dick move. She might be embarrassed and feel like there was a bit of a trust violation for something she told you in confidence. Overall not that deep though.", "NTA childhood crushes are just cute. I have never humiliated anybody for having a childhood crush, if it was a current crush on a mutual friend who you wasn't married to then it would be a different story.", "Nta but they facts she\u2019s upset about it means she either isn\u2019t over the crush or it was more to her than that.", "There\u2019s no statute of limitations when someone tells you something in confidence and no harm would have come to anyone if you would have kept your mouth shut. You used her as a form of entertainment and don\u2019t give a f that you have upset her.  YTA. And a shitty sister and a shitty friend.", "My sister had a crush on my husband when we were teenagers. Also, back then my friends tried to set up me and my (now) BIL. All of this is out in the open and it\u2019s no big deal.

The sister has to now live with that awkwardness. Just saying, \"It's not awkward if she no longer has a crush\" puts her in a situation where she's not allowed to be embarrassed otherwise she still has a crush. Congratulations. You have her emotionally pinned. Great job.\n\nEven if she did still have a crush, is she acting on it? Are you asking her to just turn off her emotions? Why instigate something that doesn't need to be instigated?\n\nYour comment is a strong yikes from me. Reminds me of people who are unable to leave any stone unturned.

This isn't hiding infidelity or traumatic family secrets from your spouse. This is info that serves to benefit literally no one, but it does make your sister feel embarrassed.
