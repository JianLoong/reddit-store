I told him this a good 3 years ago and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s ever teased her or even brought it up around her so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. However, my stepsister found out I had told him because one of our friends drunkenly brought it up and my husband said he already knew and mentioned that I was the one who told him.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal but mostly my stepsister and female friends are acting like I broke some sort of sister code by telling him about her crush. I have tried apologising but my stepsister said she wouldn\u2019t forgive me for telling him as it\u2019s humiliating for her that he knows.\n\nWas I TA?", "created_utc": 1684079851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hftvt/aita_for_telling_my_husband_my_stepsister_had_a/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do not know how old you are but if you were kids then and adults now, why does it matter? If she is embarrassed you may need to ask if that crush is still there.", "NTA.  This is your husband.  I suspect you told him for a reason.  But anyway, I\u2019m not letting someone dictate what I share with my husband, especially something as silly as a years-old crush.   This is drama for drama sake.  Unless she still has the crush.  Hmmmm\u2026.", "INFO: How does the drunk friend know?", "NTA, Little gossip like this happens constantly throughout families & friend groups. Secrets are very rarely kept and giving the time frame at which this one was revealed it is so insignificant to your stepsisters life at this point.\n\nIt's best to not tell people other things like this because people get embarresed. However, if someone doesnt want someone to know something they it's best kept to themselves.\n\nConsidering it is your husband, I doubt he cares either.", "NTA. Sounds to me like your stepsister is embarrassed that she still has a crush, tho. Just a hunch.", "NTA", "NTA, and the only reason you\u2019re NTA here is because this is your husband. The person in whom you are allowed to confide ANYTHING. \n\nThis is just an understanding I have with every one of my guy friends. No one is required to keep any secret from their spouse. Also, what about this friend who coughed it up when drunk? Are they getting dragged too?\n\nIf you had told your brother, father, uncle, or male-friend-in-common, the answer would be different.", "NTA. Why would having had a crush as a kid be humiliating to an adult?", "NTA it really isnt a big deal", "Info: why did you tell him? Was she being flirty with him and he was oblivious to it so you wanted to make him aware so he can shut her down?", "YTA. What was the point of telling him? Thankfully he didn\u2019t care, BUT what if it went the other way? What if he became uncomfortable being around her? And of course it was going to get back to your stepsister, once something is out, it grows legs and runs around everywhere. I feel your stepsister has the right to be angry. You embarrassed her, and now she\u2019ll always feel a bit uncomfortable around you and your husband.", "YTA\n\nNot your information to share", "NTA. You are all adults now and she\u2019s not the only girl to have had a child hood crush on a sisters bf. She needs to do some soul searching and find out why she\u2019s so upset about this.", "YTA that was a private conversation between you and your sister. What were you hoping to accomplish by telling her secret? All you\u2019ve done is likely made your husband uncomfortable and embarrassed your sister. Apologies are in order- as a good solution maybe tell an embarrassing secret about yourself", "NTA", "NTA, but you probably should have told her that you mentioned to him. She was probably just embarrassed.", "NTA", "hard to say I don't see anything wrong here but i am also not a woman. You probably broke some women code so for them you're TA but for normal people NTA", "YTA it wasn\u2019t necessary, my sister clearly had a crush on one of my bfs and I didn\u2019t even mention it to her for years. She was so shocked that I knew", "And why is nobody angry at the drunken friend?", "I had a childhood crush on Batman. NO ONE TELL.", "I don\u2019t think there was ever a conversation.", "Couldn\u2019t have been that private if the drunken friend knew as well\u2026", "I\u2019m telling everyone!!", "How else would she know this? It was private info", "I guess idk just my vote I wouldn\u2019t have done this", "The behavior could have been very obvious. Besides already at least 2 people knew. What are the odds of the only other person spilling the beans? Not that private.\n\nAnd can you imagine going: hey sis, I want your boyfriend!"]}
