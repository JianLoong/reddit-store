He\u2019s done it twice already. He can wait the 3 days. Simple \u201cpunishment\u201d for a simple offense.", "Generally NTA, because really, how big of an asshole can you be if you\u2019re caring for your nephew long term, buying him books, and simply doing your best to prevent conflict between him and your child?\n\nIf it were me though, I\u2019d probably just take them to the library or bookstore and let them pick out different books so it isn\u2019t an issue at all.", "Honestly NTA. \n\nHe still got the book, so I really feel like this was a victimless crime. Both of them still had fun, but there was a concrete consequence for not considering his brother's feelings in the past.", "NTA You\u2019re doing a massive favor for your BIL. If he wants to make parenting choices then he needs to be there to do it. It\u2019s not like you banned Jack from reading it, you just slightly delayed it. That\u2019s hardly a punishment\n\nedit: if BIL doesn\u2019t even have a problem with it, then there\u2019s not even a problem. Also the kid is being a dick. Why should your son have to bear the burden of being his sounding board for Jack learning not to spoil things?", "It\u2019s probably a mild disappointment that he\u2019ll learn from. I expect that he won\u2019t give away future books and you won\u2019t need to wait to let him have his copy any more. NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt's not like you only bought a book for your son. Jack still got the book. It's only fair your son has a chance to read something before his cousin spoils it for him.", "You protected the excitement and adventure of a new book for your son's sake. Good on you. I'd tell Jack the truth: No one wants a spoiler. So, if you want to get a book at the same time as as Cliff, stop intentionally ruining the endings for him. That's mean. And you can stop at any time.", "NTA your nephew did the same thing 2xs and is old enough to know better. This is a perfect way to teach a kid that actions have consequences.", "NTA. Repeat offender of book spoilage, go straight to jail. Just kidding. Both kids got their book at the end of the day, one just had to wait a tiny bit more for their wordy reward. There is honestly no harm to it.", "You expect a 13 year old not to ruin it for the other child.\n\nYour Husband was right to do this", "I\u2019m going with a light YTA. My reason here is that if you continue to deal with the problem this way, you are 1) not giving Jack the opportunity to learn better behavior, and 2) you are showing Jack that you don\u2019t trust him to behave as he has promised.", "Small YTA. You should have let your nephew try to keep his promise first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He spoiled two books, so now he doesn\u2019t get to read the new book first. \n\nHe already had his second chance and blew it.

Perhaps giving the son first crack at the next couple books would be fair, with the follow-up discussion about keeping his word to refrain from ruining the experience for his cousin.", "After all of the cursed, godforsaken trash fires of family situations I have read today I was surprised that you have such a small issue. And I'm so glad for you. No screaming match? Nobody assaulting anyone? No one getting manipulated by a family member in some sinister way? \n\nNAH here. You are both right in a way and both trying to show respect for kid and nephew in your own ways. Hug each other and appreciate each other. Give the kids some compliments too. They like to read. They like each other. This is wholesome.", "NTA - I was working at a coffee shop the day the last Harry Potter book came out. \nSupposed to be just the morning but an AH didn\u2019t turn up because she knew I needed the day off.  \nI threatened to pour hot coffee on a customer who tried to tell me something about the book.  \nPeople who spoil books are AHs.  \nYour nephew deserved to wait.  \nNow he knows the consequences maybe next time he won\u2019t ruin it for your son.", "NTA - The punishment fits the crime here. Now give him a chance to keep his promise with the next book.", "Jack needs harder books to read. Percy Jackson - a favourite of both my daughter's when they were younger - is not particularly challenging for a 13 year old who reads regularly. When my elder daughter started doing this it was in part because she wasn't being challenged enough by the content anymore.\n\nGet him a kindle unlimited subscription and just let him go. The books he reads will be to advanced for an 11 year old so there won't be much cross over and by the time there is he will hopefully have out grown this impulse. Plus the subscription is cheaper than purchasing books.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real AHs are your BIL and his wife who decided they could not be bothert to raise their kid themselves and just abandoned him with you.", "Nta", "NTA, OP. And thank you for a wholesome problem that makes people happy to read about.\n\nFirst book spoiled can be an accident/mistake. Second book spoiled is, at best, not having learned a lesson (and unkind, at worst). Having to wait 3 days is not torture; it's a reasonable consequence for previous spoilers AND a likely deterrent for future spoilers.\n\nBut, honestly, your whole family sounds like a really nice family. That's why your post is one that makes us happy.", "NTA. I once read about a teacher/professor (don't remember if it was a high school or college class) who threatened his class with spoilers from GOT if they didn't start behaving. They didn't listen. So he let slip who was the next character to die. Needless to say he didn't have any more problems in his class after that. In the end, both boys got the book, and your nephew will hopefully learn that spoilers are not a good thing.", "NTA.", "NTA, spoiling ppl can go hike and spoil them self on everything.", "Also a really dumb argument for op and spouse to even have, let alone needing the internet to solve it for them.", "Exactly this.
