He\u2019s done it twice already. He can wait the 3 days. Simple \u201cpunishment\u201d for a simple offense.", "Generally NTA, because really, how big of an asshole can you be if you\u2019re caring for your nephew long term, buying him books, and simply doing your best to prevent conflict between him and your child?\n\nIf it were me though, I\u2019d probably just take them to the library or bookstore and let them pick out different books so it isn\u2019t an issue at all.", "Honestly NTA. \n\nHe still got the book, so I really feel like this was a victimless crime. Both of them still had fun, but there was a concrete consequence for not considering his brother's feelings in the past.", "NTA You\u2019re doing a massive favor for your BIL. If he wants to make parenting choices then he needs to be there to do it. It\u2019s not like you banned Jack from reading it, you just slightly delayed it. That\u2019s hardly a punishment\n\nedit: if BIL doesn\u2019t even have a problem with it, then there\u2019s not even a problem. Also the kid is being a dick. Why should your son have to bear the burden of being his sounding board for Jack learning not to spoil things?", "It\u2019s probably a mild disappointment that he\u2019ll learn from. I expect that he won\u2019t give away future books and you won\u2019t need to wait to let him have his copy any more. NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt's not like you only bought a book for your son. Jack still got the book. It's only fair your son has a chance to read something before his cousin spoils it for him.", "You protected the excitement and adventure of a new book for your son's sake. Good on you. I'd tell Jack the truth: No one wants a spoiler. So, if you want to get a book at the same time as as Cliff, stop intentionally ruining the endings for him. That's mean. And you can stop at any time.", "NTA your nephew did the same thing 2xs and is old enough to know better. This is a perfect way to teach a kid that actions have consequences.", "NTA. Repeat offender of book spoilage, go straight to jail. Just kidding. Both kids got their book at the end of the day, one just had to wait a tiny bit more for their wordy reward. There is honestly no harm to it.", "You expect a 13 year old not to ruin it for the other child.\n\nYour Husband was right to do this", "I\u2019m going with a light YTA. My reason here is that if you continue to deal with the problem this way, you are 1) not giving Jack the opportunity to learn better behavior, and 2) you are showing Jack that you don\u2019t trust him to behave as he has promised.", "Small YTA. You should have let your nephew try to keep his promise first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
