Your husband isn't a bad gift giver. He just doesn't care. He also procrastinates to the point of literally last minute, so what you want isn't available anymore. It sounds like gifts just aren't that important to him. My husband had issues for years of being a bad gift giver so...after years of being disappointed, I started sending him links for stuff I like. All he has to do is use the search option in our texts with \"next time you have to buy me something \" and pick the most recent one. Try this, and hopefully, it'll help him like it helped mine.", "NTA\n\nBut i would just give him a taste of his own medicine.  Birthday, christmas and fathers day next year just put in the same energy he does and see if he really doesn't care about gifts (then fine, some ppl just don't care about things that much) or if he is disappointed (in this case he is just a selfish AH not caring about your gifts but expecting good gifts in return).", "NTA - he doesn\u2019t care enough to listen to you or get what you actually want. Keep exchanging what he gives you for what you really want. And if you really feel some type away about it, start returning the favor \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, but stop asking him for things. He is not getting it. Buy gifts for yourself. Let him do mistakes alone, you will return them anyways. And I feel he doesn't think about your needs and feelings so this is a bigger problem.", "NTA .  Stop being so thoughtful about his gifts.  Clearly gift giving isn\u2019t his \u201carea\u201d or he just doesn\u2019t care enough to put forth the effort.  From now on decide what you want and buy it in plenty of time.  Wrap it for yourself, and give it to yourself on your birthday.  He won\u2019t disappoint you anymore, you get what you actually want, you don\u2019t have to return or exchange.  If this bothers him, it is just too bad because he doesn\u2019t feel the need to try.  Start putting the same effort into the gifts you buy him.  Buy stuff with the same amount of attention he applies to your gifts.  He will definitely notice.  It is kind of petty but sometimes a person does not understand something u til they experience it themselves.  Kind of like toddlers biting, until they get bit, they don\u2019t understand that it hurts until it is done to them.  I had a biter child so this I know works well.  Good luck", "NTA. Get him a gift card. Tell him several times what you want.  Then buy the gifts you want, wrap them up and when he gives you the wrong gifts, take out the boxes you wrapped, unwrap them and say thank you for buying what I wanted.  You can return the shit you bought me.", "NTA.\n\nNot everyone is a good gift giver or places a lot of value on gifts, which is fine, but you've literally told him exactly what you want and made it incredibly easy for him to get you something that you like. Yet he can't even do that? He's being the asshole here - not because he doesn't spend months of planning gifts, but because he isn't listening or making the tiniest effort to make you feel valued. \n\nThere's already some comments in here framing this as a 'love languages' problem and I really don't think it is. And in any case, if you prescribe to love languages, it isn't about saying \"my partner's love language isn't gift giving, so I should always expect shit gifts from them and accept it\". It's about understanding that a) gift giving to express love doesn't come naturally to them and b) therefore you need to communicate what you'd like from your partner and to express that this is something that's important to you. Problem is, it sounds like you've done exactly that by telling him precisely what gift you'd like, and he still can't seem to do that and also gets annoyed that you aren't loving his wrong gifts.\n\nIn terms of communicating this to him maybe it's about expressing that your disappointment isn't necessary about the gift itself, but the feeling of not being listened to and the lack of effort when you've already made this very easy for him.", "NTA. And I\u2019d just give up on the idea of gift giving between the two of you because he clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit. Just refuse gifts, buy your own things that you actually want and will use.

Electric grinders arent super expensive, the UGGS might have been, but he didn\u2019t seem to care about the expense , just the effort he had to put in to get the right ones.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to take that lack of effort personally when you put a lot of effort in yourself.", "People put up with this?", "NTA.  My husband forgot my birthday for 4 years running, never mind anniversaries or other occasions.  Our son told him he\u2019s an ass for straight up ignoring my birthday, and he seemed embarrassed.  \n\nHe felt bad enough to start getting me a bunch of \u20ac10 flowers and some chocolate every year at the florist up the street. \n\nI manage to nicely say thank you.\n\nAfter that started however, I gave up on ever getting a thoughtful gift again. Now every year, I go out and get *myself* something I really want, but wouldn\u2019t normally spend that much on, for myself.  Last year I bought myself an Apple Watch for my birthday.  The year before, I got myself a PS5. \n\nI still get him gifts, but I don\u2019t go all out finding the perfect thing, either.  He never gives me hints or requests. So I don\u2019t ask him what he wants, I just give it two minutes of thought and the answer is usually obvious. \n\nI got him a smart watch for his birthday after he said mine was cool (he has a heart condition and it was to monitor his heart rate), which was expensive and I thought useful\u2026.he \u201cforgets\u201d to wear it and it\u2019s gathering dust.\n\nAt some point, you have to decide to ignore someone\u2019s lack of thoughtfulness, and be thoughtful for _yourself_, because it\u2019s not always possible to find a partner who is considerate and puts in the same level of effort. \n\nI\u2019ve been asking for a spa day for about 6 years now.  I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be getting for my birthday this year. \n\nYou should do the same.", "NTA. If he was trying, and missing the mark, that'd be one thing.

I\u2019ve come to understand that gift giving is a skill that some people have and some don\u2019t\n\nAsk him to take you shopping instead of giving you gifts.

Your propensity for gifts as a love language seems like something you're holding HIM accountable for, when clearly he's terrible at it.   \n\n\nIt's probably time to figure something else out. Maybe just let him off the hook for gifts and figure out another system or something.

You already know gifts are your love language and clearly not his. What is his love language? Are you still in love? Do you reciprocate in his love language? Does he appreciate your gifts as much as you hope?\n\nIt sounds to me like you feel slighted by this behavior, so why not change the expectations and \"rules\" for gifting. It doesn't sound like a financial issue, either. Maybe brainstorm with him on a solution. Such as:\n\n* You both agree to stop gifting (reduce your resentment and his anxiety about gifting.)\n\n* You each set aside a budget for gifts and buy your own. You can wrap it and pretend surprise on the occasion to keep it fun.\n\n* You can put several items into your Amazon shopping cart and have him choose one and delete the others, making it still his choice and your surprise. (Just don't peek at the past purchase list.)\n\nMy husband of 50+ years has always been horrible about gifts, and long ago we came up with solutions that work for us. He looks for heart shaped rocks when he is at the beach or walking and brings them home to me. He buys me some flower seeds for my garden. He picks up something at the grocery store he thinks I might like to try. Little things with no timing pressure. His love language is thinking highly of me even when not with me. That's certainly fine with me!", "I fully understand how you feel; putting all the effort into giving thoughtful and useful gifts and then getting gifts that you didn't want back can be frustrating. It's not the gifts per se but knowing that the other person didn't care enough about you to arrange for them so that they would be something you liked and actually wanted.\n\nBecause your hubby may not be doing this intentionally though, maybe you could try to talk to him about it and explain your process in the hope he would adopt it as well? \n\nSoft NTA because some people are just bad with gifts I guess.", "...

What if you put all that energy you expend on his gifts to another project? Lots of organizations have giving trees ect and you can put that energy where it\u2019s appreciated.  \n\nI like the idea of texting him links to make it easy for him.  Unless I am missing something- he isn\u2019t dismissive or neglectful otherwise?  Holding someone to standards on something like gift energy when it\u2019s not something they enjoy seems unfair.

And buy yourself the electric grinders. They are amazing.", "YTA. \n\nWhat you're describing is a shopping list, not a gift idea. If you're set on only accepting the specific item, ask for cash. It's more honest about the transaction at hand and cash will give you the ability to get exactly what you want.", "NTA. My ex didn't listen. He gave me presents I didn't even want. He wouldn't even return the blender I didn't want and used it for himself. That felt neat.", "Yikes NTA...\n\nThe only thing you can do is return the things that are of no use. I don't know how to remedy this. Maybe get him a walmart gift card for his next gift.", "NTA\n\nMy husband sometimes doesn't listen to me either. I told him I wanted a new cookware set but mentioned I was excited to look at them and pick 2 that I liked the most. He came home with this nice set but not something I'd buy personally. Just silvery colored and kinda boring. You can't use plastic on the metal and my favorite stuff is all plastic stuff because I don't feel like I'm cutting into my hand when I use them. \n\nHe knows I like mugs though. I bought him (well he did, because I'm a SAHM) a volunteers blanket because I know he's proud of being from TN. He uses it and actually wanted to hang it up\ud83d\ude02 he's hard to shop for though but I try my hardest with the amount he gives me (we spend 25-45 for each other, he goes overboard though and I can't exactly show him what I'm getting him).", "Don't go overboard for him, half-ass it.", "Why do you continue to put effort into his gifts when he clearly doesn't care to do the same for you? Have you tried treating his gifts the way he treats yours, getting him something at the last minute that is sort of like something he really wants, but definitely not actually what he wants?", "Even better? Make wishlists on a site like Elfster where you can add links from literally anywhere.  It\u2019s a lifesaver with my kids who would otherwise have 6 lists in diff places"]}
