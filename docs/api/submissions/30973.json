Your husband isn't a bad gift giver. He just doesn't care. He also procrastinates to the point of literally last minute, so what you want isn't available anymore. It sounds like gifts just aren't that important to him. My husband had issues for years of being a bad gift giver so...after years of being disappointed, I started sending him links for stuff I like. All he has to do is use the search option in our texts with \"next time you have to buy me something \" and pick the most recent one. Try this, and hopefully, it'll help him like it helped mine.", "NTA\n\nBut i would just give him a taste of his own medicine.  Birthday, christmas and fathers day next year just put in the same energy he does and see if he really doesn't care about gifts (then fine, some ppl just don't care about things that much) or if he is disappointed (in this case he is just a selfish AH not caring about your gifts but expecting good gifts in return).", "NTA - he doesn\u2019t care enough to listen to you or get what you actually want. Keep exchanging what he gives you for what you really want. And if you really feel some type away about it, start returning the favor \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, but stop asking him for things. He is not getting it. Buy gifts for yourself. Let him do mistakes alone, you will return them anyways. And I feel he doesn't think about your needs and feelings so this is a bigger problem.", "NTA .  Stop being so thoughtful about his gifts.  Clearly gift giving isn\u2019t his \u201carea\u201d or he just doesn\u2019t care enough to put forth the effort.  From now on decide what you want and buy it in plenty of time.  Wrap it for yourself, and give it to yourself on your birthday.  He won\u2019t disappoint you anymore, you get what you actually want, you don\u2019t have to return or exchange.  If this bothers him, it is just too bad because he doesn\u2019t feel the need to try.  Start putting the same effort into the gifts you buy him.  Buy stuff with the same amount of attention he applies to your gifts.  He will definitely notice.  It is kind of petty but sometimes a person does not understand something u til they experience it themselves.  Kind of like toddlers biting, until they get bit, they don\u2019t understand that it hurts until it is done to them.  I had a biter child so this I know works well.  Good luck", "NTA. Get him a gift card. Tell him several times what you want.  Then buy the gifts you want, wrap them up and when he gives you the wrong gifts, take out the boxes you wrapped, unwrap them and say thank you for buying what I wanted.  You can return the shit you bought me.", "NTA.\n\nNot everyone is a good gift giver or places a lot of value on gifts, which is fine, but you've literally told him exactly what you want and made it incredibly easy for him to get you something that you like. Yet he can't even do that? He's being the asshole here - not because he doesn't spend months of planning gifts, but because he isn't listening or making the tiniest effort to make you feel valued. \n\nThere's already some comments in here framing this as a 'love languages' problem and I really don't think it is. And in any case, if you prescribe to love languages, it isn't about saying \"my partner's love language isn't gift giving, so I should always expect shit gifts from them and accept it\". It's about understanding that a) gift giving to express love doesn't come naturally to them and b) therefore you need to communicate what you'd like from your partner and to express that this is something that's important to you. Problem is, it sounds like you've done exactly that by telling him precisely what gift you'd like, and he still can't seem to do that and also gets annoyed that you aren't loving his wrong gifts.\n\nIn terms of communicating this to him maybe it's about expressing that your disappointment isn't necessary about the gift itself, but the feeling of not being listened to and the lack of effort when you've already made this very easy for him.", "NTA. And I\u2019d just give up on the idea of gift giving between the two of you because he clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit. Just refuse gifts, buy your own things that you actually want and will use.

Electric grinders arent super expensive, the UGGS might have been, but he didn\u2019t seem to care about the expense , just the effort he had to put in to get the right ones.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to take that lack of effort personally when you put a lot of effort in yourself.", "People put up with this?", "NTA.  My husband forgot my birthday for 4 years running, never mind anniversaries or other occasions.  Our son told him he\u2019s an ass for straight up ignoring my birthday, and he seemed embarrassed.  \n\nHe felt bad enough to start getting me a bunch of \u20ac10 flowers and some chocolate every year at the florist up the street. \n\nI manage to nicely say thank you.\n\nAfter that started however, I gave up on ever getting a thoughtful gift again. Now every year, I go out and get *myself* something I really want, but wouldn\u2019t normally spend that much on, for myself.  Last year I bought myself an Apple Watch for my birthday.  The year before, I got myself a PS5. \n\nI still get him gifts, but I don\u2019t go all out finding the perfect thing, either.  He never gives me hints or requests. So I don\u2019t ask him what he wants, I just give it two minutes of thought and the answer is usually obvious. \n\nI got him a smart watch for his birthday after he said mine was cool (he has a heart condition and it was to monitor his heart rate), which was expensive and I thought useful\u2026.he \u201cforgets\u201d to wear it and it\u2019s gathering dust.\n\nAt some point, you have to decide to ignore someone\u2019s lack of thoughtfulness, and be thoughtful for _yourself_, because it\u2019s not always possible to find a partner who is considerate and puts in the same level of effort. \n\nI\u2019ve been asking for a spa day for about 6 years now.  I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be getting for my birthday this year. \n\nYou should do the same.", "NTA. If he was trying, and missing the mark, that'd be one thing.

I\u2019ve come to understand that gift giving is a skill that some people have and some don\u2019t\n\nAsk him to take you shopping instead of giving you gifts.

Your propensity for gifts as a love language seems like something you're holding HIM accountable for, when clearly he's terrible at it.   \n\n\nIt's probably time to figure something else out. Maybe just let him off the hook for gifts and figure out another system or something.

You already know gifts are your love language and clearly not his. What is his love language? Are you still in love? Do you reciprocate in his love language? Does he appreciate your gifts as much as you hope?\n\nIt sounds to me like you feel slighted by this behavior, so why not change the expectations and \"rules\" for gifting. It doesn't sound like a financial issue, either. Maybe brainstorm with him on a solution. Such as:\n\n* You both agree to stop gifting (reduce your resentment and his anxiety about gifting.)\n\n* You each set aside a budget for gifts and buy your own. You can wrap it and pretend surprise on the occasion to keep it fun.\n\n* You can put several items into your Amazon shopping cart and have him choose one and delete the others, making it still his choice and your surprise. (Just don't peek at the past purchase list.)\n\nMy husband of 50+ years has always been horrible about gifts, and long ago we came up with solutions that work for us. He looks for heart shaped rocks when he is at the beach or walking and brings them home to me. He buys me some flower seeds for my garden. He picks up something at the grocery store he thinks I might like to try. Little things with no timing pressure. His love language is thinking highly of me even when not with me. That's certainly fine with me!", "I fully understand how you feel; putting all the effort into giving thoughtful and useful gifts and then getting gifts that you didn't want back can be frustrating. It's not the gifts per se but knowing that the other person didn't care enough about you to arrange for them so that they would be something you liked and actually wanted.\n\nBecause your hubby may not be doing this intentionally though, maybe you could try to talk to him about it and explain your process in the hope he would adopt it as well? \n\nSoft NTA because some people are just bad with gifts I guess.", "...

What if you put all that energy you expend on his gifts to another project? Lots of organizations have giving trees ect and you can put that energy where it\u2019s appreciated.  \n\nI like the idea of texting him links to make it easy for him.  Unless I am missing something- he isn\u2019t dismissive or neglectful otherwise?  Holding someone to standards on something like gift energy when it\u2019s not something they enjoy seems unfair.

My dad used to constantly ask me for my gift list at Christmas and I could never think of what to put on it. Now he just gives me cash. As he says \"it's always the right size and color!\"\n\nWorks out best for us both.", "I sent him a full Christmas list with plenty of options so I\u2019ll see how that goes \ud83d\ude02", "I love to shop and I buy all my family's gifts as well as my own gifts at Christmas. I wrap them all up and then on Christmas morning everyone is so excited to see what \"they\" got me. It's all done very cheerfully and I'm never disappointed!", "I did this with my husband, and that's what finally got him to realize how I felt. He'd always fall back on excuses of being so busy, I'm hard to shop for, etc., and when I did exactly what he did to me (completely forgetting to get me gifts, no card, nothing), he realized how absolutely crappy it felt and hasn't messed up since.", "I stopped putting effort into my husband\u2019s gifts. Not like in a petty way, but I was driving myself bonkers trying to find super cool or rare gifts. He is not into material things like that at all so while he liked my gifts, he doesn\u2019t enjoy them. He ended up telling me to chillax about the gifts and that he preferred food, bourbon, cool socks, and tshirts. Where I used to spend weeks trying to find THE PERFECT GIFT, I can take maybe 30 minutes and get him things he actually wants or needs. This also helped with the disappointment I would feel when I was more excited about his gifts than he was.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02I\u2019ll keep this in my back pocket", "Sometimes it feels like it too \ud83e\udee3", "My kids are 3 and 7 and only once has he helped them get me gifts", "Gifting is her love language and that's fine. The problem is she is expecting gifting to be HIS love language too when clearly it is not. OP is going to continue to be disappointed until she lets go of her expectations and embraces his low energy gift giving style. She needs to find some way to meet her needs as a recipient that also requires next-to-no energy for him. Maybe a card and a check. OP can specify the amount to cover whatever item she really wants for her birthday.", "Lol did I \u201cknow\u201d him, I didn\u2019t marry a stranger \ud83d\ude02 And I wouldn\u2019t say he was the best gifter back then either but we were teenagers when we met so I didn\u2019t expect too much. Although he was still better back then, like our first Christmas together he got me the most beautiful necklace and after I saw the screenshot of it in his phone dated a few weeks before Christmas. And he hasn\u2019t really done anything like that since. My first birthday with him wasn\u2019t as great but he still did something and we were just broke college kids so I wasn\u2019t mad or anything.", "I won\u2019t die on this hill, but I will lay on it for a while. I just wanna know I\u2019m not crazy \ud83d\ude02", "LOL would've been fine with the gift card, it was the way he did it. Right in front of me and days before christmas.", "Yea I try to not come across ungrateful but I don\u2019t need two of everything", "What a weird response", "She\u2019s not upset about the disparity so much as his lack of effort. She\u2019s bringing up her amount of effort to show how important gifts are to her. Both of them putting in no gift effort is NOT what she wants - I wouldn\u2019t want that either, sounds sad as hell.", "Trying to keep the mood light and avoid the instant divorce comments. I don\u2019t hate him for this, he just thinks it\u2019s rude for me to return/dislike what he gets but I don\u2019t agree.", "I hate to give Bezos even more money, but my family all have Amazon wish lists. Makes it very easy for gift giving.", "I buy what I want wrap it up with a tag from him to me and open in it in front of him and he is always surprised and never can remember that he bought me what i actually wanted.", "Amazon wish list. Send him the link each time. Keep adding stuff to it. Even with prime, it'll arrive in time for your birthday/holiday", "Yeah.  I'd do it back...oh you wanted an electric screwdriver....nope here's a regular dollar store one...don't be extra", "I mean, I don't think lowering her expectations to meet his \"next-to-no energy\" requirement is good either. Regardless of what you think about love languages, OP's husband should try to be more thoughtful.", "She\u2019s already telling him exactly what she wants, no guessing games at all. How much more \u201clow energy\u201d does she need to be? At some point it\u2019s just about him not caring enough.", "Well there are plenty of countries where bride and groom do not know each other before. \ud83d\ude09\n\nPoint is: you are right to desire more effort and better gifts. But from what you wrote, he does not do this intentionally and you knew from the start how he is.\n\nNAH", "I think that crazy is an awfully strong word\u2026 It\u2019s completely understandable on some level to want your partner to share or understand your love language. \n\nbut also, once it\u2019s been established that they don\u2019t really get it, it\u2019s kind of beating a dead horse to keep getting upset about it .\n\nAt that point, it\u2019s important to find a workaround .", "Start buying gifts for the men you have in your life and have them gift you back. He will soon feel like he's missing a trick. Or he will not mind your new gift giving pal, and you get to have what you want.", "Is he lazy or dismissive in other areas?  I get that it\u2019s a weird response if you are looking for some kind of validation on how you feel.  I am glad you are getting that too if that\u2019s what you need.  I am just offering an alternative idea or way of thinking.  Move on if it\u2019s not what you are after.", "It's a lack of respect and love towards you though. Laziness, selfishness, disrespect, and then he makes YOU feel bad afterwards for his deficiencies.\n\nI haven't had a great time with life but one thing I have learned and will never sway on, is if my partner does not respect me I will not be with them. Respecting you means respecting your feelings, caring about you on more than a surface level, putting in effort to show you they care. And no manipulation. Never. He is manipulating you into feeling bad for HIS poor choices, it's extremely messed up.\n\nI think part of the reason you don't see this as such a huge deal is that he's been chronically manipulating you into thinking you are the problem. You are not, at all. Not even a little bit. He is dismissive, conceited, seems to think he can do no wrong and you need to just get in line with whatever he wants.\n\nDoes he have any redeeming qualities? Because if he dismisses your feelings/preferences in this area, it's quite likely he dismisses your feelings and preferences in most other areas too.", "Ah ok. So is it more of an \"oh husbands, what are you gonna do, that's how they are\" thing than a serious relationship-breaking thing? Either way I hope you get the gifts you want this year, be it from him or from yourself. I don't see anything wrong with exchanging or returning gifts you can't use; it's the spirit of the thing that matters.", "Pro tip: just because it's an Amazon wishlist doesn't mean you have to buy it off Amazon. Buy from a business you want to support and mark as purchased elsewhere so no one duplicates.", "This. I check out my sister's wishlists for her kids etc, then buy them on eBay or elsewhere", "I feel like this would cause confusion and end up in duplicates, a shared google slide would work better", "Thats why I say to mark them as purchased elsewhere on Amazon. The link to do so is in small text on the list below the buy it button.", "Sorry, I'm honestly not familiar with Amazon wishlists so I didn't know other people could change the status. I had a family member try and do something similar with her baby registry and it ended up with her getting a bunch of dupes because her registry would only change it once someone bought it from the link", "Well yes, it does depend on people taking the time to do the mark as purchased. Humans are always the weak link in the system!"]}
