It had stressed her out so much because she is very close to her family. \nBut it got way better when we got to know of her pregnancy.\n\n\nRecently, I've been really busy with work but I always make sure to spend as much time with her as possible. Things went really smooth for entire first trimester. \nAfter 2nd trimester started, her anxiety is higher than ever. She tells me she feels weird and very uneasy at the thought of viens and blood vessels of our baby growing inside of her, she sees viens and blood vessels when she closes her eyes and it makes her really sick. She has also been puking a lot lately. \nAnd she always says that when she pukes hard, she thinks the baby will suffocate inside of her and when she tries to sleep, she is always afraid that she will roll onto her stomach and the baby will explode\n\n\n\nThings are fine physically. We've had two check-ups done in last 10 days.  \n\n\nI told her to take it easy and try to relax her mind. Divert it with shopping or something. I also tried really hard to spend more time with her but my busy schedule is not allowing that and I am trying to get things done so when baby arrives, I can stay home to look after them both.\n\n\nShe has also been telling me everyday that she really misses her parents and she feels very lonely. Everyday, I go home and she has same things to say. I am not complaining, but sometimes I'm exhausted after a long day and just want to rest a bit.\n\n\n\nRecently, I had a really rough day and when I got home, she was upset that I'm late and started to complain about how I am being so insensitive when I know how lonely she already feels and still don't try enough to be there for her.\n\nWe got into an argument. It was our first argument in months and things got heated. \n\n\nI ended up telling her she needs to stop whinning and being paranoid all the time. And if she really misses her parents this much, she can go see them in Canada.\n\n\nShe told me that she actually would if her doctor had not restricted her from travelling until delivery and she is sorry for bothering me so much.\n\n\n\nI knew right there that I messed up big time so I apologised immediately but things havent been the same since.\n\nShe is distant and quiet now and I feel so awful. \n\nMaybe I was too harsh and I could do a lot better in that situation or just kept my mouth shut.\n\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702412507, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gvddg/aita_for_snapping_at_my_pregnant_wifetelling_her/", "score": 386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Heartless.", "YTA \u201cjust stop thinking about it\u201d sounds like \u201cjust stop telling me about it\u201d - support your wife- help her get some support in the form of a therapist and maybe some maternity groups to make some friends and talk about her anxieties with people who understand. She\u2019s tired, nauseous, anxious and overwhelmed- help her do these things!", "YTA this is why the birth rate is falling. Women are sick of having kids with men who whine and don't give a damn", "You got it right. YTA. Your wife is dealing with some major anxiety and the answer would be for you to listen and be sensitive to her fears, not telling her to basically suck it up and think about shopping (???).\n\nIf your wife's whole life is being derailed by these intrusive thoughts then she should talk to her doctor about it as it could be antenatal anxiety. It's very common but could get worse if she doesn't seek help. \n\nBut the one thing you don't do to help someone who's not only pregnant, but also regularly puking and suffering from horrible anxiety, is make them feel alone and isolated while also belittling them. I understand your wanting to work to make money before the baby arrives but your wife needs you *now*. Go visit the doctor together and talk about what she's feeling and how her anxiety is making this pregnancy very hard for her. Make more time to spend with her. Listen to her fears and don't dismiss them but encourage her to use whatever resources her doctor recommends to help manage them. See if you can get her parents to come visit her rather than having her go to them (which sounds like it can't happen anyway). But no matter what you do, adjust your attitude asap.", "YTA. These feelings are not typical pregnant feelings and she is massively suffering. She needs perinatal counseling and probably a perinatal psychiatrist. But mostly, she needs a partner who's supportive.", "She thinks the baby will explode? \n\nShe needs to see a doctor immediately. None of this sounds normal. She is feeling isolated, anxious and having very very weird thoughts and fears. She needs to be see asap. \n\nYou both also need to plan who can help after birth. Work on your support system. Who's going to be in the room with her. \n\nBut this doesn't sound normal at all. You need to figure out what's happening..", "YTA\n\nI can understand that things seem absurd and you're stressed with all sorts of factors.  But you were unnecessarily callous to your wife.\n\nI personally think she needs to see some sort of therapist. I don't know if there's some directly related to pregnancy/baby things. But she could use some serious counseling and reassurances from a professional to soothe her extra anxiety. It's reasonable to be anxious especially since it's her first.\n\nBut the things you describe also sound similar to a hypochondriac.\n\n Besides therapy/consoling maybe see if her mother could schedule a visit to her?\n\nMaybe see how she feels about having someone like a midwife? Or doula around to talk and bond with to support her through the pregnancy", "YTA, you said the single worst thing you could say and broke her trust. She can't trust you to be her support system now because how do you open up to somebody that said stop whinning? How's she supposed to confide in you? She needs to talk to a professional because her anxiety and paranoia about veins and stuff is to big for her to deal with on her own.

The emotional load of your own responsibilities plus her emotional needs....you're frustrated, exhausted, burning out....BUT......she is growing a whole ass human inside her. Her emotions, hormones, life...everything is completely out of synch and she feels like she has no control. You are her person. Her support. Her rock. She is going to come to you in this terrifying time, that is only natural. Sometimes my dude, you just need to take a deep breath, and find an outlet for your frustration later like a video game or gym or whatever.....she is going through one of the single biggest changes she will ever go through, and it is scary as fuck.", "YTA And your wife needs medical help. Please get her treatment. These are not normal symptoms.", "As other have said, doctor, now.\n\nDon't let this turn into that story you tell and say \"if only i had known\" your family is at risk.

We've never experienced that and can never begin to imagine what she's going through. Her feet have gotten bigger, maybe even her hands. She has stretch marks and she's carrying all this extra weight. Her back hurts, her head hurts. She's nauseous and the hormones are messing with her perceptions. and then there's a baby kicking her from the inside out. And she's probably heard a million horror stories about miscarriages and everything that can go wrong, so she's probably terrified.\n\nThat sounds like hell. This sure seems stressful for you too, but keep in mind, it's the same for her, but just about 100x worse. Her paranoia is attacking her as well, especially if it's her first. If you're stressed, she'll be there for you emotionally too. Maybe not in a talking way, but you can comfort each other. \n\nRight now she doesn't feel comforted. I would be thinking that I just lost the only support I had, that I was completely alone, and that my partner was disgusted with me, and I'm not even pregnant. I can't imagine how she feels.", "YTA - Huh. Who would have thought that emotional abuse DOESN'T help someone in a massively stressful situation?! \n\nSo you offer nothing to help.

Some of the things she\u2019s struggling with are very concerning and need to be addressed by a professional that can help her deal with her anxiety and possible intrusive thoughts.

Seriously, take your wife back to her doctor to discuss this possibility.", "YTA - you\u2019re going to have to keep a VERY close watch on her once baby is born as she is likely going to feel isolated and alone and may slip into somewhere dark.

Your wife is suffering and your response is to tell her to \"stop being paranoid\". You're the asshole, for sure.", "This sounds a lot like OCD symptoms based on my non-expert opinion - especially the troubling intrusive thoughts that she can\u2019t get rid of. The harder she tries to not think about those things or chastise herself for her thoughts the worse it will get. The worst thing you can do for OCD is trying to argue with it or run away from it. She needs to see a doctor and/or therapist right away so that she can receive the right treatment which involves facing the obsessions head on (likely exposure therapy and possible medication). OCD thoughts can be very very weird and very troubling. It\u2019s good that she\u2019s open enough with you to even share the thoughts she\u2019s having as many suffers are very embarrassed by the content of their obsessions.\n\nShe can\u2019t \u201ctake it easy, relax, or stop being paranoid\u201d anymore than you can control the weather; at least, not without the right help. It\u2019s very frustrating for the person not experiencing these obsessions because they don\u2019t make any sense and you can\u2019t use logic or reason to quell them. I\u2019m not a therapist or a psychiatrist, but I have a daughter with OCD, who we thought just had anxiety and this all sounds very familiar.  Maybe even check out https://iocdf.org\n\nEdit: I should also mention that finding a therapist that specializes in this can be difficult as many aren\u2019t well trained in exposure therapy (if the ultimate diagnosis is OCD).", "You already know YTA why are you asking us", "Sounds like yta. She's clearly having a very hard time with her pregnancy. But it sounds like you're also going into overdrive preparing for the arrival of the baby, which is incredibly taxing as well. She needs immediate attention for her anxiety surrounding the pregnancy. I would've been mortified if my baby mom had been saying those things to me. But you also need to keep your own health in mind. And make sure that you don't burn yourself out. You seem to recognize that yta, so I wouldn't spend forever beating yourself up.

If she\u2019s cooped up in the house most of the time with nobody to hang out with or go do something with, which seems like the case if your best pitch to alleviate your wife\u2019s vomiting episodes and stress over crushing/exploding her baby is to \u2018distract herself with shopping\u2019 Just fyi I hope you realize how commonly this is perceived as sexist for pretty good reason, I\u2019m assuming you said it because you think your wife particularly enjoys shopping, but I can\u2019t imagine why you would think WALKING (we all know how much pregnant women love walking) around alone looking at clothes that don\u2019t fit or aren\u2019t going to fit in 3 months is somehow a stress reliever. Your wife should have some FRIENDS or a therapist, trying to fix the issue by changing your work schedule or getting her parents down for a week is temporary, she needs a life outside of you and her family and a space where she can have her fears calmed and get some social interaction. Best thing I could recommend is that you find an expecting mothers community group or Mom meetings or whatever, find a time to go with your wife, and watch as baby making pros alleviate some of your wife\u2019s more horrible ideas and she has some places to go during the day or friends to talk to. If those aren\u2019t her thing maybe suggest reconnecting with old friends. Whatever the case your wife needs support during the day as well as human interaction. Continuing to be irritated by your wife\u2019s needs and fears will just make her stop talking about them. If she has the baby and begins to rely more on your help when you\u2019re home it\u2019s going to be worse when you go back to work if she still has no other friends. Again this is all assuming she\u2019s not involved in these things and it really is just you and her parents.", "YTA. She\u2019s hormonal. When she initially started being paranoid and anxious of the baby growing inside of her you two should have discussed therapy, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not the first person to feel this way.

It could really help her make some connections with people going through pregnancy and make her feel less lonely. If shes up to it Peanut is a great app to meet other local mums and expectant mums.

It has really stressed her out so much because she is very close to her family. \nBut it got way better when we got to know of her pregnancy.\n\n\nRecently, I've been too busy with work but I always made sure to spend as much time with her as possible. Things weng really smooth for entire first trimester. \n\n\nAfter 2nd trimester started, she has been really overthinking. Telling me how she feels weird and very uneasy at the thought of viens amd blood vessels of our baby growing inside of her. She says she sees viens and blood vessels when she closes her eyes and it makes her really sick. She has also been puking a lot lately. \n\n\n\nThings are fine physically. We've had two check-ups done in last 10 days.  \n\n\nShe says when she pukes hard, she thinks the baby will suffocate inside of her and when she tries to sleep, she is always afraid that she will roll onto her stomach and the baby will explode.\n\n\nI told her to take it easy and try to relax her mind. Divert it with shopping or something. I also tried really hard to spend more time with her but my busy schedule is not allowing that and I am trying to get things done so when baby arrives, I can stay home to look after them both.\n\n\nShe has also been telling me everyday that she really misses her parents and she feels very lonely. Everyday, I go home and she has same things to say. I am not complaining, but sometimes I get tired after a long day and just want to rest a bit.\n\n\n\nRecently, I had a really rough day and when I got home, she was upset that I'm late. She started to complain about how I am being so insensitive when I know how lonely she already feels and still don't try enough to be there for her.\n\nWe got into an argument. It was our first argument in months and things got heated. \n\n\nI ended up telling her she needs to stop whinning all the time. And if she really misses her parents this much, she can go see them in Canada ( I didn't actually mean it).\n\n\nShe told me that she actually would if her doctor had not restricted her from travelling until delivery and she is sorry for bothering me so much.\n\n\n\nI knew right there that I messed up big time so I apologised immediately but things havent been the same since.\n\nShe is distant and quiet now and I feel so awful. \n\nMaybe I was too harsh and I could do a lot better in that situation or just kept my mouth shut.\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also she may at any point spike gestational hypertension which almost always ends up with preeclampsia. They told me it was rare, and surprise surprise - i got it. As well as dozens of other who were told \"its rare\". After reading more about it - its not that friggin rare, its rare when it kills you tho so thats true. But the rest, tole on your health, tole on your physical health - its there. For life. \n\nYou might as well go to the doc, get a bp monitor and start checking her daily - and learn how to do it correctly. HG with what shes describing - was how i spiked 160/100 at 20 weeks. Had to be on medication till maxed, of maxed dosage no longer worked at 34weeks and i had to deliver asap when it got to 168/114. \n\nJust saying. Ignorance is bliss.

The place where you get the YTA for me isn't even snapping at her, that happens it is posting here and asking if you are TA instead of going to a pregnancy support site/group and asking how you can help your wife without burning yourself out to the point of snapping at her. You got lucky that a professional is on here and has given you amazing advice that you should absolutely listen to. Your wife and your child's lives may depend on it. \n\nSo while I don't think you are TA for snapping or not being at your best. However you are for seeking validation when you should have been seeking help. Validation is about soothing your feelings temporarily help is about easing the situation for you both more permanently. Validation is fast and easy help isn't always. \n\nTruly, I hope you listen to the wise professional and seek help for your wife.

I personally think you have some maturing to do, espically because you know your wife is pregnant and instead of leaving the situation you chose to sit there and fight with her.
