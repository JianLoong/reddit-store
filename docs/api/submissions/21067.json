By day 2 of his dad being here, I couldn't handle it anymore because this guy makes me uncomfortable in an \"you're not wanted here\" sense, so I left and went back to my mom's. I told my husband about it and he's upset because he wanted to spend time with me and asked me to just reconsider but I really don't want to be around this guy alone. I feel like I can't even get a drink of water without being judged for it (like he literally will start micromanaging it and telling me \"don't leave that cup on the counter top\" or \"no drinks in the bedroom\"). Or he will go in to the bathroom after I'm done using it and make sure I didn't dirty it. There was a droplet of water on the edge of the sink one time and he scolded me about cleaning up after myself.
