Her and her fiance have been living together for 5 years. Myself and her other aunt have been planning on throwing her a bridal shower since the beginning of her engagement. We were full steam ahead on the plans (venue reservation, planning for games and decorations, etc) until yesterday when I asked my niece to make a registry for the stuff she wants. She told us that she doesn't need anything and doesn't want a bunch of crap in her house. I then wondered why we're throwing a bridal party if she doesn't want anything. Isn't the point of a bridal shower to shower the bride with gifts? She said it would be fun to have a shower even though we aren't giving her any gifts and she suggested giving her gift cards instead. This just seems pointless since gift cards/money are usually actual wedding gifts rather than shower gifts, and we're already spending a lot of money on the venue itself. My sister (her other aunt) cancelled the venue reservation today after careful consideration and we no longer plan on throwing the shower. We informed my niece of this and are waiting for a response. Am I an asshole for cancelling the bridal shower?\n\nEdit: we've discussed cancelling the bridal shower with her in depth before doing so. This decision didn't come out of nowhere.

A bridal shower isn't a gift grab, and why would the person NOT getting the gifts be upset? And every bridal shower I've been to has had things like lingerie, flavored lube, penis lollypops, etc. It's a fun time to laugh and joke. You don't know how to do either one, do you?
