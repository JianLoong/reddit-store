Her and her fiance have been living together for 5 years. Myself and her other aunt have been planning on throwing her a bridal shower since the beginning of her engagement. We were full steam ahead on the plans (venue reservation, planning for games and decorations, etc) until yesterday when I asked my niece to make a registry for the stuff she wants. She told us that she doesn't need anything and doesn't want a bunch of crap in her house. I then wondered why we're throwing a bridal party if she doesn't want anything. Isn't the point of a bridal shower to shower the bride with gifts? She said it would be fun to have a shower even though we aren't giving her any gifts and she suggested giving her gift cards instead. This just seems pointless since gift cards/money are usually actual wedding gifts rather than shower gifts, and we're already spending a lot of money on the venue itself. My sister (her other aunt) cancelled the venue reservation today after careful consideration and we no longer plan on throwing the shower. We informed my niece of this and are waiting for a response. Am I an asshole for cancelling the bridal shower?\n\nEdit: we've discussed cancelling the bridal shower with her in depth before doing so. This decision didn't come out of nowhere.

A bridal shower isn't a gift grab, and why would the person NOT getting the gifts be upset?

I guess in your mind every event is just an excuse for a gift grab. Stay classy. YTA.", "YTA. This is supposed to be about what she wants - not about how you think it should be. If you really cares about her happiness, you wouldn\u2019t have canceled it.", "Yta. Do you know how many people went off the registry at my shower & wedding? I got tonnes of crystal that I never used, home decor that didn't fit in my place, etc. A gift card shower is SO much better than getting crap.", "Info\n\nLike, cancelled the idea entirely or cancelled the fancy party for one with family and close friends?", "NTA. I had already lived on my own for a decade before getting married. I had all the housewares I needed. We knew we\u2019d receive money envelopes at the wedding and I didn\u2019t want to gouge our family and friends for more gifts, so I didn\u2019t bother with a shower. It seems like it\u2019s a pretty outdated concept, anyway. Sitting around watching the bride open gift cards is silly.", "I've never understood bridal showers for couples who are already living together. They've already gotten everything that falls under traditional gifts. It makes more sense to give cards for date nights, or everyone bring a favorite recipe along with the ingredients. Otherwise just enjoy getting to celebrate with them.\n\n\n\n\nI don't want to say YTA because you did say you had talked about with her. But it is kind of an asshole move to cancel something you had been planning just because they don't actually need anything.", "YTA. Jesus Christ, you both sound like petty, out of touch children.", "YTA. I think your response to her request says a lot more about you and your sister, than your niece.  She just wanted to celebrate her future with the people she loves and you don't see the point if she's not going to make people give her things. \nHow classy you are.\nAll the obligatory invites you get to events are going to start getting pretty thin on the ground in the near future.", "Wtf of course you\u2019re the asshole here.\n\nPrepare to be uninvited to the wedding ya boomer.", "YTA\n\nThat you expected her to follow your agenda and expectations for HER upcoming nuptials is pretty damned arrogant.", "YTA \n\nit\u2019s unusual for a bride not to be bothered about gifts, she truly did want presence and not presents.\n\nyou could have suggested  she request a donation to charity in leu of gifts", "YTA. You asked a question to the bride to be (you know, the one who you were planning this for), and she gave a straight and honest answer. And you can't accept that because of what exactly? Your own view on what a bridal shower should be?\n\nYeah, YTA for not respecting her wishes.", "YTA.", "YTA - I actually think not wanting gifts is fine. Saves everyone a few bucks and she seemed more interested in having a party with her friends and family.", "YTA. Ugh. You asked her, she told you. The bride has a say and you did not like her say so you got petty as f. It\u2019s not your party.", "YTA, the point of the shower is to celebrate her being a bride and moving onto a new chapter in her life, not to give her gifts she doesn't need. Good lord, the girl is lucky she now does have to spend an afternoon with you two.", "Ew. A bridal shower is for one person- j hint is not you. Grow up. \n\nAt least niece knows who you are now. YTA", "Potentially unpopular opinion here, but NAH. I 100% agree with you that a bridal shower is kind of pointless once you take the gift giving aspect out of it. I don't know many people who enjoy the cheesy games and unless you know a lot of people at the shower, socially they're kind of awkward. Even though times have changed and most couples live together and (technically) have everything they need in their home, I feel like most use it as an opportunity to \"upgrade\" to nicer items (maybe I'm cynical, but I'm just going based on what I've witnessed).\n\nWith all of that said, I do think it's admirable that your niece is honest about how she doesn't really need anything. I also get it if she still wants some sort of celebration of her upcoming marriage, but that to me sounds more like an engagement party than a shower.\n\nEDIT: I guess I'll entertain a different perspective with INFO- are you considering doing a smaller, less expensive celebration for her (maybe just at someone's house) or is it no party at all?", "YTA \nThe focus of my shower was having my closest friends and family there to usher me into the next stage of my life. The most special part was when they went around saying lovely things that they value about me and also wrote me lovely cards. They were showering me in love, not gifts.\nI think you have a different perspective on the point of a shower and were just offended that hers is not the same.", "What? That\u2019s so materialistic of you. Why are you throwing her anything when you don\u2019t want to follow her wishes? She\u2019s the bride, not you. YTA", "yes, you're the asshole.", "What's wrong with just having a party? It's not like the gifts would have been for you, so there's nothing lost on your side. Or is it that the party would have been your gift ***for*** the party? In that case, why would gift cards be bad gifts for your niece? Gets her things that she and her partner might not need now, but might later.\n\nYTA. Either celebrate your nephew and this new chapter or don't. Just weird that you wouldn't want to throw the celebration unless she gets gifts...", "YTA. If you aren\u2019t throwing the party as she would like it, and are cancelling because it doesn\u2019t meet your own definition of a shower, then it was never about her. You just wanted to throw a party. So throw your own, it was clearly all about you guys the entire time.", "YTA \n\nSince when is a bridal shower just about gifts??? \n\nIt\u2019s about fellowship and OFTEN both sides of the family get to come and meet beforehand and bond. So her in-laws would have had a nice chance to come also. It\u2019s about celebrating the bride, playing some games and yes, a family party.", "NTA", "Exactly! My ex and I were moving from the city just days after our wedding and asked for the gifts to be money or gift cards for places that we could purchase what we needed for our new home as we didn't want to lug a whole bunch of stuff across the country.  Unfortunately, some people didn't listen, so I was forced to leave all of it behind and had my mother either try to return it or sell it.  There are many reasons why people ask for gift cards.", "But isn't that what the wedding/reception is for? To celebrate the wedding and her marriage with the people she loves?", "Any excuse to have a good get together with friends and said friends aren\u2019t expected to spend money to see you is a great party.\n\nIn our lives we only get maybe 2 parties that have us see our friends and relatives together- wedding and retirement. We need more excuses to party and connect!", "No, the bride to be said she wanted GIFT CARDS", "Ooh a wine shower sounds fun!", "THIS!!!! So much more meaningful than a set of pans she already has.", "Technically it's a wedding registry, but usually most people buy gifts from the registry for the shower. I think sometimes people will bring physical gifts to the wedding, but I feel like that's usually people who missed the shower. Most others just bring money to the wedding as a gift. That's at least in my experience.", "Lingerie is the correct spelling and I love that you stated you still had the night gown and added also still having the hubby as an afterthought :)", "I legit thought loungerie was sexy comfortable clothes and I am now super disappointed.", "I think it would be very weird to get lingerie as a gift at my bridal shower. My mom got married in the 70s and got things like crock pots and towels, so idk why you think it's some new thing.", "Things like lingerie, lube, and penis lollypops are for the bachelorette party, not the bridal shower.", "... I've never been to a bridal shower that had lingerie and penis pops. That's usually for the bachelorette party if people bring gifts to that. Granted I lived in the US, so maybe things differ by country, but I feel like the general trend is that the bachelorette is friends/the bridal party but the bridal shower includes family from both sides. To each their own, but I wouldn't want to unbox lube or lick a penis pop in front of my great-grandma or future in-laws...", "The bride isn't the one who is expecting gifts for her bridal shower, she was happy with just getting together with friends and family to celebrate. But her aunts kept insisting that people needed to bring gifts, so she said that gift cards would be fine instead. \n\nJust because the couple has already been living together for a while and don't need anything to set up their home doesn't mean they don't deserve to have special celebrations with loved ones.", "I feel like you didn\u2019t like the replies you received so you added an edit to your post that contradicts some of the last words of your post. \u201cWe informed my niece of this and are waiting her response\u201d after your sister cancelled the venue. Of course there\u2019s no longer a shower or a party of the like because she is probably done with you two. \n\nMy SIL threw me a \u201csurprise shower\u201d themed \u201cbuck and doe\u201d.. I do not partake in anything in my personal life that would indicate that as a potential shower theme for me. You should always ask for the brides input. It is her party, not yours. SIL was not in my wedding party and she only invited my moh and my husbands friends and family. Instead of the ladies old fashioned shower that I would have wanted with little sandwiches and dainties I got sloppy joes and chips. I even had to wear a cowboy hat and a fringed vest. I\u2019m not ungrateful (and never showed any disdain even though I was like \u201cwhere the fuck are my friends\u201d) but seriously these parties require bride input and she gave you hers and you cancelled because \u201cno gifts\u201d then why bother. \n\nBecause what you could have said \u201chey a gathering without gifts\u2026 ok\u2026 new plan then. Let\u2019s make it a potluck and every family can bring a dish. And we can play games and laugh all night. I think that\u2019s what she might have wanted. You could have suggested a theme for gifts that could have been inexpensive - tree ornaments, plants for the yard, picture frames for the future they are planning. So many things. \n\nBut in the end it\u2019s the brides opinion that matters. If it\u2019s an everybody party the groom too. You have forever stained your relationship with her and her partner. All because she did not want gifts. The bride did not want and you wanted her to have them, she did not want them. She probably wanted a casual gathering before the official day. Maybe she knows that multiple gifting is onerous for some people. \nHave the day you deserve, ma\u2019am.", "Lol how petty. Imagine trying to win this argument on a technicality \ud83d\ude02", "The trick is just to not go if you don\u2019t like them. Let people have their fun. As long as they stop blowing shit up at gender reveals.", "Not an after thought just happy news in this day and age people divorce so easily. Seems marriage has become disposable.", "I sense a new business opportunity. :)", "Because the bridal shower is about the bride. Weddings have always been for the household. Maybe it is a regional thing?", "I've been to bridal showers where they asked guests to bring their favorite recipe to share with the bride.", "I just can't imagine opening a lingerie gift in front of my 86 year old grandmother, but if that's what's normal where you are then okay. Those kinds of gifts are generally saved for the bachelorette party. I've seen more wedding showers than bridal showers these days, where both the bride and groom attend and receive gifts. A lot of showers also ask for things like favorite recipes or charity donations just because so many couples don't need a lot of gifts.", "Then stop being an asshole", "If they kept the venue and changed the name of the event, that would be satisfactory to you?\n\nI wonder if the niece was aware of and asked for a bridal tea, if the aunts would have obliged or just dismissed the tea because gifts were not involved", "We did this! It was a fantastic way to gather favorite recipes from all of our loved ones in their own handwriting. All of the recipes are in our regular cooking rotation.", "No idea what the aunts would do; when Niece declined to create registry as she wanted gift cards, they declined to host a shower as cash equivalents weren't appropriate for shower gifts. \n\nBridal tea doesn't come with gifts and it sounds like Niece was on a gift grab as she wanted gift cards so likely shed have declined a tea also.\n\nWith regard to venue, in my circle, bridal showers are hosted in someone's home or the community room in apartment/condo, not at a paid venue.", "It\u2019s the ghost of Emily Post"]}
