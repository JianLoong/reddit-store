Early on we discussed how we would have 3 children. We had our son, now 5, and after this my partner was adamant he didn\u2019t want another. I said I wasn\u2019t mentally prepared to have one and only. I was an only child and orphaned at 15 and wish I had siblings, he grew up with 7. Anyways I said I wanted atleast one more. He wasn\u2019t happy about this and I said I wasn\u2019t budging and it was kinda a deal breaker. I didn\u2019t babytrap him, he could have left. He agreed to have another supposedly because he didn\u2019t want to lose me. After TTC for 2 years, he also agreed to undergo fertility treatments as we were having troubles. Long story short, our second and last child is here. He\u2019s been a great dad to our first and has shown little interest in this baby which I understand. I realize I\u2019ve basically become a single mom in this situation, however he knows there\u2019s an expectation to help here and there, which he does. However, when he\u2019s in a mood or when he sees I\u2019m overwhelmed for doing literally everything (both kids & housework), he loves to throw it in my face that this is what I wanted and he doesn\u2019t want this \u201cdamn baby\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to take care of him.\u201d I feel heartbroken but I think I did it myself.\n\nETA: Our initial conversation about starting to TTC happened in 2020 when our son was 2. He ultimately agreed. This was followed by proposal, marriage and a house. After fertility troubles, we began treatment in 2022 and baby was born 2 months ago. I guess after all this time, yes, I wasn\u2019t expecting husband to act this way?", "created_utc": 1694384955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fdwng/aita_for_having_another_a_baby_and_expecting_some/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

ESH", "ESH\n\nYou gave him an ultimatum. He chose to have another child with you rather than leave. Strangely, you both seem surprised that the other is unhappy. You should have been going to couples therapy. Perhaps you could have better understood the consequences of the decisions you made. Pretty clear ESH.", "ESH. You should never have pressured him into having another child you KNEW he did not want. You should have left. He should never have agreed to have another child he did not want. He ALSO should have left.\n\nWhen will people learn children CANNOT and DO NOT fix relationships?\n\nShame on BOTH of you, and I weep for your poor children", "ESH. You pressured him to have another child...  well, now you can't really expect him to be thrilled and happy about having extra responsibilities when he made it clear he didn't want it ?!", "Esh. Him for obvious reasons and you for pressuring him to have another", "It's a hard call. The discussions early on were for 3 kids as you didn't want a single child, and he agreed. Then he changed his mind. You should probably have gone to marriage therapy or divorced at that point ( then you could have met someone else). The fact that he went for fertility treatments, etc, indi ates that he consented to becoming a father. What happens when the baby grows older? Will he ignore and  neglect that child?", "Get some family therapy to sort this out now. If he can't love the baby then really you have no choice, but to divorce your kids come first. If you stay in a relationship allowing him to treat your second this way you would be the AH. \n\nI'm going with ESH, he blindsided you by saying only 1 after agreeing on 3. You pressured him into a second but he could have and should have said no especially as you needed fertility help to get pregnant he had ample chance to say no. If this was a deal-breaker for him he should have said no. Now baby is here he has to get over it or get out. Treating your baby like this is wrong and should be a deal breaker for you.\n\nGet help please and good luck", "IMO YTA, you torched your own marriage (because he clearly starting to resent you) by issuing an ultimatum on a gamble based off your own experience being a single child. What happens when your kids grow up and don\u2019t have a relationship with each other?", "\"I didn't baby trap him, he could have left\".\n\nSo you gave him the ultimatum of having another child he didn't want, or leaving and losing the joy of being an amazing, fully present father with your first? \n\nNot really a choice for him, was it? Emotional entrapment and a total YTA move. And whilst you have your second child, you're left in an imbalanced family situation that will only build further resentment.", "Yta, you brought an unwanted child into this world and your upset that he is treating him as unwanted. You keep making bad decisions.", "Jesus ESH. I know you say you left the choice to him (to leave or to have another child), but honestly, you shouldn\u2019t have. When you reached the impasse, you should have just left him. Because this is, frankly, a very predictable result of pressuring someone into having a child they don\u2019t want. \n\nAs for him, he\u2019s behaving despicably. The reality is he *did* choose to have this baby, and now he\u2019s punishing both you and the baby because he regrets it. That\u2019s super shitty behavior. \n\nI\u2019d recommend counseling and also would prepare for divorce, frankly.\n\nEdited to clarify first sentence.", "ESH. Instead of giving him an ultimatum, you should have had long, serious conversations with him about why he changed his mind. It appears that neither of you communicated well on this matter. \n\nHe sucks more for not taking care of this new baby, he helped create, regardless of how much he wanted another one.", "NTA.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have had a baby. Undergoing fertility treatments does not indicate \u201cnot wanting a baby\u201d\n\nHe should have held firm on his boundary if that was an issue and not just half assed bringing a baby into the world.", "ESH. You gave him an ultimatum & unfortunately, he stayed with you. You\u2019ve created a situation that is clearly built on resentment as opposed to mutual respect. Now here you are and you\u2019re both unhappy. Part of me is saying, \u2018what did you expect?\u2019 Unfortunately, there is now a second child who is going to suffer due to both of his parents. There is nothing more to say other than you both suck.", "ESH - I was also emotionally manipulated and coerced into fathering a child, so I was very tempted to say you're the AH. I love my son more than life, so I cannot understand how your partner could have such contempt for his own child, which makes him an AH, too.", "ESH is the best call here.  He's acting how you would expect him to act under the circumstance.  You bent his arm into having another baby. I hope he gets over it.", "ESH\n\nWhat did you think would happen?", "ESH. But apart from him not wanting another kid, what's his excuse for not doing the housework?", "You emotionally blackmailed him and now, shocking, he\u2019s unhappy. \n\nWho could have possibly seen this coming\u2026? /s\n\nYTA", "ESH.  Yes, you did it yourself.  You knew he wasn't onboard with another child.", ">I said I wasn\u2019t mentally prepared to have one and only. I was an only child and orphaned at 15 and wish I had siblings,... .. I said I wasn\u2019t budging and it was kinda a deal breaker.\n\nSo you admit that you made your childhood trauma his problem?  ESH, but you started it.", "I honestly wish more men felt empowered to move on when these conversations happen. Compromise does not mean saying YES to an entire human. The baby and the mother deserve a partner who wants to be there. The man deserves a life he wants to live. NTA but you both should have accepted the incompatibility. \n\nLove and care can exist outside of a romantic relationship.", "INFO: Has there been any therapy, and is this something he'd consider? I feel like individual and couple's therapy is needed here before you damage this child's self esteem irreparably (which can happen much earlier than you'd think).", "I had a younger brother who wasnt wanted. He was shut out, and neglected his whole life. It was painfully obvious to everybody, even us kids, especially with the photos in the photo album. A million pictures of us but none of him. Your baby is going to feel this, all the time. I think you should leave, and just be a single mother, since you are the only one who will treat the child with love.", "Info.\n\nWeird no one mentioned this, but fathers can suffer from PPD too. To me, it sounds like he may be experiencing it.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922346/\n\nAlso, you mention you were orphaned with no siblings at 15, and he grew up with seven siblings, is it possible he lied to you when he said he wanted three because he knew you wouldn\u2019t agree to one?\n\nSomething about this feels a little fishy. Like he wanted her, so he told her what she wanted to hear, and planned on telling after they had one child together (hoping at that point she\u2019d be ok with it). He just up and changed his mind knowing your background?! Then you give him an ultimatum, no suggestion of individual or couple\u2019s therapy - he just agrees, repeatedly (for year, through fertility treatments). It happens, but seems odd. Very odd.\n\nEither way, I\u2019d look into whether your husband is suffering from PPD.", "I am so sorry but you need to run, your husband is already verbally abusing the baby and the abuse will just get worse. The baby will suffer a lifetime of abuse from your husband as he will not treat the baby well and treat your other child better.\n\nI don't think in any way you trapped him\n\nHe will abuse your baby, he may not hit the baby but he will abuse the baby by not loving the baby. \n\nPlease run now, this is not going to end well. Find a lawyer and get the husband to sign away his right to the baby and get on with your life. \n\nRUN", "I can understand why everyone on here is saying ESH, but i suppose i have the unpopular opinion on this one and can sympathize with the OP. Originally they agreed to 3 and he only changed his mind AFTER she was already kind of 'baby trapped' herself. Had he said this before, she may not have chosen to stay, and I do believe she had the right to say that if he didn't want another she would leave, as it is her right to do what's best for her. I don't feel this is emotional manipulation, he even went as far as to have fertility treatments, and he never once thought to just stop and say no more? He ACTIVELY chose to have another child, he doesn't get to get off because he didn't actually want it. Hell, we give more grief to deadbeats who leave, but because she gave him the ultimatum that means he's justified. And the commenter saying that he had to choose between staying with his child or leaving, so he chose something he didn't actually want, for his own personal gain is narcissistic and emotionally abusive. Granted no parent wants to lose time with their child, but to stay in a relationship and agree to something to 'appease' his wife knowing he was just going to reject the next baby is selfish and fucked. He could have still had a rewarding relationship with his son, while she chose to move on, and potentially had more children with a man who didn't bullshit the entire time.", "he was a full grown adult who made his part in the conception happen.  He doesn\u2019t get to bail now or I should say if he is going to bail now he should fuck all the way off .  \n\nHe is playing it like a tit for tat and while the baby is too young to get it now..your older child is taking notes and soon enough that baby is going to know.\n\nPlain talk about the unsustainable situation that\u2019s being created and putting an end to the passive aggressive bullshit is critical . Neither one of you adults are dong right by your kids with this", "Ultimatum of leaving if you don't get your way. Basically saying to your partner that this particular thing (which doesn't exist yet) is more important than someone that you claim to love. That's a MAJOR dick move right there.\n\nYour husband, I believe, is trying to make a point. It is rather childish of him to do that. He's definitely being an ass if he keeps doing it for more than a few weeks.\n\nI still think that you're the bigger asshole here because you still forced him to bring this child (even if you don't believe that you did).", "YTA, sorry to say.  When you pressure your partner in the way you did, you end up damaging the relationship which is the foundation of the family you're supposedly trying to create.  I've always read and heard that when it comes to having children it's either both partners totally IN or don't do it.   You've now got a damaged marriage and I can't see how that benefits your child/children.  Esh", "ESH but more so YTA majorly\n\nYou pressured him to have another child when he made it clear he did not want another child. Despite you stating you weren't prepared to have one and one only, this should been something you both talked about and UNDERSTOOD before a child let alone two. Things happen, what if you had had twins? Triplets? It doesn't matter he didn't want to lose you because now your youngest will grow up seeing their older sibling be favored or just more emotionally available to dad. You did this, and are ensuring an insecure and likely traumatic child and their future. Your oldest may develop senses of guilt due to being the only child with an emotionally available dad. I can't stand when I see this. The youngest is going to be the one suffering and have little to no cognizance of why. If he didn't want another, don't have sex or unprotected sex. And if that would have likely resulted in divorce, then again - this is something you two should have discussed and came to an understanding about before being married let alone being together for so long. Those poor children.", "Esh", "YTA. You insisted, he gave in reluctantly. Babies are a two yes, one no proposition. You gave him an ultimatum and are unhappy with the result.", "I guess I'm going against the grain a little here but NTA. You were clear about your expectations and desires from the start, he repeatedly agreed to them then changed his mind. He's allowed to change his mind before you're committed, but going through fertility treatments demonstrates personal investment in the decision. He misled you on his degree of willingness to do this and now he's saddling you with all this extra work and throwing it in your face as if you forced him.\n\nI get where people are coming from about the ultimatum. Kids aren't something anyone should commit to because of someone else, it should always be a decision based on individual desires and willingness to take on the work. But it would be unfair to you to not state how important it is to you and to ask for that need to be met. To state that this is a deal breaker for you and he's allowed to walk away if he's not willing. That if he refuses to have another kid you'll do what's best for you. This feels more like a boundary than an ultimatum to me - it's not a threat, it's an explanation of the gravity of importance this has for you, of what you'll do if he's not willing to meet that need.\n\nThis isn't a dynamic that can continue without causing serious harm to everyone in the family. Regardless of how you got here, you're here now and his attitude will poison every part of your lives if it doesn't change. It's time for both of you to go to individual therapy then come together in couples counselling to work it through. Your kids deserve to grow up in a home where their parents are loving and respectful to each other and everyone in the home. That's not what's happening right now and it will only get worse from here if there isn't a significant course correction", "ESH, you are toxic and manipulative, I wanted another child, right? So much so that you manipulated and gave ultimatums to your husband to have him, now that you have him you complain, he is also an idiot because from what you can see this will be the beginning of favoritism.", "YTA, you did this to yourself and your children. Why force someone that was not committed to  having another child? What you are experiencing is the consequences of your own actions.", "Wow. NTA. You discussed having multiple kids prior to the first. You're married. After the first, he said no more, so you entered the marriage with an expectation, a pretty serious one, that was now being reneged. And, ultimately the only real point that needs to be made, he sired that child. He agreed to the responsibility. He wasn't going to lose you because you wanted another kid. He was going to lose you because he backed out of a serious prior agreement. As a single orphaned child, I could see how this would be a serious sticking point for you.", "YTA. SO MUCH YTA.\nBabies should NEVER be unwanted. YOU have set this child up for trauma.", "NTA **for expecting him to help out. \n\nHe agreed to have another baby. He did the work and made the baby, so whether he wanted it or not, he has another kid, and he's a dad of >2<.  He still has to raise that child, and treating it less than the 1st is just going to end up traumatizing 2nd child.\nPeople need to stop having children that they don't want.\n\n\n\nI do think it's worth pointing out that while yes, he could've left, you also could've, and I do that ultimately if you are the person with a dealbreaker that comes up in the relationship, then it should be your choice to stay or go. I don't think that's something you should make the other person decide.", "YTA, what a terrible parent you are/gonna be. You didnt NEED 2 kids.", "You both need to see a therapist. ESH, you for not just leaving and finding someone who wanted another kid and him for acting like a child. Ultimatums never work out well and just typically result in problems with the relationship. Talk to someone together to try to work through these issues.", "NTA\n\nEveryone who said you gave him an ultimatum is ignoring the fact that\u2019s how this conversation *always* goes. *Everybody* knows and agrees that kids is a deal breaker. You were not being manipulative to state it was your deal breaker. Your husband made his decision, and you took him at his word. He does not get to mistreat his second child and his wife because of it. He made his bed, he needs to lie in it.\n\nFrankly, it sounds like you should be getting a divorce and child support.", "Esh\n\nHe put his foot down, and should have kept it down, that he didn't want a second child. He knew he wasn't going to care about something he didn't want, he shouldn't have helped create it. \n\n*You* should have taken the hint that he didn't want the second child, and not pushed him to have the second child. Yes you *did* baby trap him because the trap was the first child, the one he *did* want, he didn't want to lose the mother of the child he wanted. \n\nWhen he told you he'd have a kid because he didn't want to lose you, you should have slammed in the breaks and rethought having the second child. Y'all should have had the child because you both wanted *the* *child*.\n\nYou are both giant ahs in different ways that both equal that neither of you should have had a second child.", "ESH.  I'm so sad for the baby.  All of you need to get this sorted out in some way so the baby/child doesn't go through life with the burden of being unwanted and resented by it's father.  It's odd that DH agreed to go through fertility treatments. But hey, as you said, you got what you wanted.", "ESH. What a horrible situation you\u2019ve created.", "ESH\n\nBut this is what you get when you push having a baby when the other partner clearly doesn\u2019t want one and is basically coerced to agree. He sucks cause its his kid", "NTA.\n\nFrom the title alone (at first), I would say that your partner should've kept things in his pants. But after reading the whole thing, your partner decided to undergo the entire process. It's your responsibility as much as his.", "ESH and NAH - Sometimes, when you really love someone, it\u2019s hard to accept that the relationship and the life that we want is not possible with them. Instead of being honest and true to yourselves, you both are left with regret and resentment. And now you risk hurting your kids because of it. \n\nSome friends of mine have been going through a similar situation, but for their one child (5 yr old). They agreed to have kids before they got married, wanted to be married for a few years first, he changed his mind and said I don\u2019t want kids, they \u201cworked it out\u201d, she had fertility treatments, they had the baby, he\u2019s not an involved parent. They\u2019re still married. It\u2019s hard to watch him be such a shitty dad and partner, and see how much it hurts her and their kid. \n\nPlease, for yourselves and for the kids, get some therapy and work this out. What\u2019s done is done, and you 2 have to figure out how to move forward and provide a safe and loving home for the kids - whether that\u2019s separate or together.", "I\u2019m feeling NTA\u2026 yes you gave him an ultimatum, but to have children (or more children in your scenario) is absolutely a deal breaker in a relationship if both people aren\u2019t on the same page. Would it be any better if you \u201cgave in\u201d to him and had only one? Probably not, because you would then have the resentment he is currently feeling. \n\nIdeally, you should have presented your ultimatum and taken some time in therapy to explore his answer further. \n\nThe fact that he was willing to do fertility treatments gives you reason to believe he would want to have another child. Why would someone go through that effort, cost, and exhaustion without enjoying the final outcome. \n\nYou\u2019re in a tricky scenario now, but ultimately NTA! Hopefully, you can seek couples counselling and find your best possible outcome for yourself, hubby, and children.", "NTA. \n\nHe had to actively participate in the conception of this child. He could have just let the relationship end, but instead he went through fertility treatments with you. \n\nIt's time for you to move on from this marriage. He can pay his child support and pretend he is child free.", "Wearing someone down or threatening to leave if they don't agree to what you want is outright shitty behaviour. \nYes they may have said initially they wanted 3, but it's very easy to say that when you've got none. There was clearly a reason he changed his mind. Money, time, mental health, your first being hard to deal with. I don't know. But you coerced him to get your own way and now you aren't happy with the consequences. \n\nESH because you both brought a baby into the world knowing it was a shitty situation. \n\nI don't feel sorry for you, I feel sorry for the poor baby that is ultimately going to suffer the most for this.", "ESH but you are most definitely the worst of the two. You strongarmed him into having a 2nd child you knew he didn't want. Giving him an ultimatum basically is babytrapping him, because who wants to lose their partner and make contact with their first child complicated over being divorced?\n\nYou put your own feelings well above his own and now you're upset that he's not emotionally invested in a child that you forced on him. If he's a good guy, I'm sure he will come around and warm up to the child, but obviously it's going to be very raw at this early stage (it's only been 2 months).\n\nHe shouldn't be taking his frustrations out on the child, he should have just left you to be honest because now there is another child who's future is pretty much in the lurch in terms of parental affection and overall favouritism, but again, this is your doing. You went down this road because you were an orphan with no siblings (I get that), but you put those feelings above letting this whole thing work out naturally and peacefully, and now you have one child who is loved by both parents and one child who is for now loved by you and you alone (could change in the future, but that's entirely dependant on your husband)\n\nYou do not respect your husband, make him do all these things from fertility treatment and fathering a 2nd child he didn't want, and you wonder why he's disconnected and disengaged? He probably feels extremely used by you, like he's some sperm bank or toy that you can throw away whenever you want. Ironically, this will probably lead you both to divorcing anyway.", "ESH. He was wrong for going back on his \u201ccommitment \u201c on more than one kid. You were wrong for forcing him into another. He is wrong for treating his new kid like crap. Y\u2019all need some help.", "ESH\n\nHindsight is 20/20. You already know where you both went wrong so I won't rehash that debacle. \n\nAt this point, he doesn't get to brow beat you because he regrets his decision to have another kid.

This is about the little innocent humans y'all brought into that mess of a marriage. Focus on them.\n\nYou cannot stay in a marriage where one child is loved and the other is resented. And no, OP, you will not be able to fix it for your youngest child by overcompensating.

You pressured him to have the kid, so find a way to fix that so your kid doesn\u2019t feel like the oldest is the golden child.", "ESH. It is incredibly hard when one partner feels their family is complete while the other one feels incomplete. It's a terrible disconnect and ends relationships all the time. It's like one of you feels their parenting is maxed out while the other feels they have more to give. Now you've added a baby and you feel you've got the right amount of kids and he feels pushed past his max. Sucks for everyone. I say ESH rather than NAH because both of you had a responsibility to figure this out before getting pregnant and sure as sugar before the baby came. Now your kids are likely both picking up on the stress in the home. \n\nYou guys need to sit down and hash this out, maybe with a couple's counsellor.", "ESH. Pressuring someone to have a kid they don't want *is* essentially baby trapping him. You also had the option to leave the relationship but chose not to.

Early on we discussed how we would have 3 children. We had our son, now 5, and after this my partner was adamant he didn\u2019t want another. I said I wasn\u2019t mentally prepared to have one and only. I was an only child and orphaned at 15 and wish I had siblings, he grew up with 7. Anyways I said I wanted atleast one more. He wasn\u2019t happy about this and I said I wasn\u2019t budging and it was kinda a deal breaker. I didn\u2019t babytrap him, he could have left. He agreed to have another supposedly because he didn\u2019t want to lose me. After TTC for 2 years, he also agreed to undergo fertility treatments as we were having troubles. Long story short, our second and last child is here. He\u2019s been a great dad to our first and has shown little interest in this baby which I understand. I realize I\u2019ve basically become a single mom in this situation, however he knows there\u2019s an expectation to help here and there, which he does. However, when he\u2019s in a mood or when he sees I\u2019m overwhelmed for doing literally everything (both kids & housework), he loves to throw it in my face that this is what I wanted and he doesn\u2019t want this \u201cdamn baby\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to take care of him.\u201d I feel heartbroken but I think I did it myself.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And he had YEARS to change his mind, but didn't until it was too late and thr baby was here. That's about as far from baby trapping as it gets.

Yet the guy, out of FEAR, as OP herself puts it, tried anyway (he probably shouldn't have but I guess he prioritised not losing his wife over that and just hoped for the best) and is now resentful.\n\nOP is childish because she is using her own trauma of being an orphan as justification of why her demand to have a child were valid. She gave absolutely zero validity to how the husband felt and again, THREATENED to leave the husband, who the OP, has specifically mentioned as a good husband and a good father to their first child.\n\nHer NEED to have another child is UTTERLY SELFISH in this regard because she could have always adopted a child at some later point in life where she and her husband feel like they can renegotiate it. She already had a biological child. It's nothing but self centred behaviour.\n\nI hardly think that \"millions\" of couples end their marriage over not agreeing to add another child to their family.

Then he\u2019d be an asshole, cause he\u2019d have no excuse for that not being good enough - it\u2019d still be his biological kid.", "I agree he sucks a lot for things you listed and changing his mind, but \"baby or I leave\" was not at all the correct approach in convincing him either. I guess in hindsight they should've had a longer conversation on how to go about this situation to avoid this exact result (resentment & disinterest towards the second child) but what's done is done.\n\nChildren are not light decisions/responsibilities so pressuring to have one is always not the way.", "I appreciate your comments. This is my first time posting something like this on Reddit. Maybe I should\u2019ve elaborated more but I feel as if it\u2019s too late. I didn\u2019t bully him into anything and it wasn\u2019t a heated discussion. We talked about this multiple times and came to (what I thought) was an agreement before TTC. His reason for not wanting a second in the first place was cause he doesn\u2019t want anymore responsibility/another person depending on him.", ">So she can never leave\n\nThat is so NOT what I said. She should have left when he changed his mind. The relationship had run its course and their goal were not aligned anymore. Both didn't want the same thing.\n\nShe had the right to want more than 1 child, and he has the right to want no more children. \n\nGod I hate reddit when they think that men are just pawn that are not allowed to have any kind of emotion and should just shut up and do what they are told.", "HE babytrapped her? That has to be the most ridiculous comment so far.", "So he was a crappy dad with your first while he was a baby and now he's a crappy day to your second while they're also a baby? What's your question, then?", "You do see that if she apologizes and stays together, her husband and her kids remain happy. If she divorces, I guarantee you that all would go through unnecessary stress. The chances of finding a \"good husband\" (again, OP's words) are not very high in this life by pure statistics. She would be throwing away happiness for a lot of people for her OWN SELFISH reasons.\n\nI kinda can't believe that you're advising OP to end her marriage over an ego battle. I'm starting to think that the only reason you're doing is that you have done the exact same thing in your life and not entirely happy with that decision. Is that it?", "I disagree, because the final conversation shouldn't have been \"divorce or another baby.\" It should have been \"you are happy with one kid and I am not. There's not a compromise there so I think we need to split up.\" \n\nThere are a couple of things that can't be compromised on and forcing someone to give in rarely ends well. Kids are one of them - and you can't undo bringing a kid in the world. It sucks if everything else in your relationship is great.

Also, OP said in comments that they had this discussion originally in 2020, when the oldest was 2. We all remember how crazy 2020 was. Is there a possibility that could be why he changed his mind?\n\nAs much as I think OP sucks for how she handled this situation, her husband sucks for how he's handling the situation since the baby's been born. If his only reason for going through with trying to have another kid was to save this relationship, he's doing a bad job of showing it right now. He's burning bridges in his relationship right now. That's why I think this whole situation is ESH.", "[removed]", "I agree she should have left, 1000%  \n\n\nBut you literally have no idea how this all came about. You are just assuming she said \"Have another kid or I'm leaving\" when it could have literally been \"I'm so sorry you changed your mind, I said this was a dealbreaker for me, so as much as it breaks my heart I need to leave.\" and he begged her to stay and said he had changed his mind (And since he already had before, why shouldn't she believe he could again?)  \n\n\nKeep in mind that this wasn't a situation of him saying in a moment of passion he'd have a second and then it suddenly appeared, he spent TWO WHOLE YEARS putting effort into trying for a kid, going for fertility treatments etc.   \n\n\nAnd she was supposed to ignore all that evidence and assume the thing he said two years ago was true instead? (Because he couldn't POSSIBLY change his mind more than once?)   \n\n\nShe's naive and a bit stupid, but she's not an asshole for believing her husband or knowing clearly what is a dealbreaker for her and what isn't.

Having a 2nd baby only works if both are on board, not one being strong armed in order to save his marriage. He told her how he feels she throws a fit and threatens to leave. She never gave room for communication, her way or the Highway, no marriage works that way. This is all on her for refusing to listen to her husbands feelings, what he wants in their marriage also holds some weight, it\u2019s not all what the woman wants", "Ok and she abused him, they both suck, she still threatened him, that shit alone is abuse.

Removing access to the child he loves, demanding child support, without giving him an opportunity to salvage their marriage.

I don't think she should leave over an \"ego battle\"   \n\n\nI think she should leave because he's refusing to parent his child and no child deserves to live with a parent who not only resents them but openly talks about it and tries to guilt the mom about it /regularly./  \n\n\nDo you think that a childhood with a parent who resents you, loves your sibling, but hates you, is better than life with a single parent?  \n\n\nI highly doubt that.", "He was not forced.

Like, I think she should've made the choice to stay or go because it was her deal-breaker, not his, but still.

Man can be victims too.", "You said in your OP that he's a \"great dad to the first one but pays little attention to the baby\" so I'm confused. And personally, I think \"helping\" with the kids makes a good babysitter, but not a good parent. \n\n\nHe shouldn't have agreed to a kid he doesn't want, and you shouldn't have put the ultimatum on him that you did. He's an AH for the first and you're an AH for the second.

That's why they're both TA. \n\nBut I will say, I'm reading the OP as it was a series of discussions in which it came down to baby or leave me. So if it wasn't, then I would suggest having a long series of conversations before saying we're not compatible. If he was on the fence, or if he asked for time to think about it and came back 100% on board for the second baby, rather than \"I'm only doing this so you don't leave\" then the OP is NTA. \n\nThere's a lot of unknowns that could change the judgement. \n\n\nHowever. If someone says \"I don't want any more kids\" and you say \"kids or we split\" - I can't get onboard with that. A \"I really want another kid - can we talk through why you don't and how you're feeling? This is really important to me\", sure. \n\nBut every kid should be brought into this world to parents (adopted or biological) who really want them. And every parent involved should really want the kid. So yeah, I'm not okay with the husband lying, but I'm also not okay if the OP went forward thinking \"well he's obviously just doing this for me but will change his mind once the baby gets here.\"", "Sorry, I was agreeing.

It doesn\u2019t have to be verbalised. If we disagreed over something fundamental and uncompromisable, of course we\u2019d split.", "Not based on the post. According to op he agreed to have a second cold so she wouldn't leave. He didn't say he was okay with it."]}
