I asked her why and she just was acting like this was a joke. Im so confused. I told my brother about it and he told me it\u2019s definitely weird and that maybe there was some kind of lawsuit but if no cops are banging on the door i should let it go and not push it any further. I know my wife hasnt been in a lawsuit but i have a bad feeling about this money. So I talked to her today and i asked if she did something with her body to get this money and she screamed at me.

Lots of money saved up\u2026 whack it over\u2026 and wait to see what sort of assumptions you jump to?

How is this funny? What am I supposed to say if someone asks where this money came from? Do we have to declare it on our tax?

It\u2019s cool. When you\u2019re trying to explain to any authority that wants to know where the money came from, just look at them and laugh, just like your wife.

She could have gotten lucky in the lottery or something. However that's not a reason to not tell. Her reluctance to tell can mean anything from won lawsuit, to doing drugs and/or prostitution.", "Given that she makes 15k/month, this is a little over 2 months salary for her. It'd be easy to save this amount if you're making that much. Definitely talk to her about this more.

I think perhaps you could have asked better but I would tell her to take the money back unless she tells you exactly where it came from because if it is illegal, someone will come for you too. Could be someone bound by government rules\u2026could be someone who can act more unrestricted.", "I did something similar...I cashed out my 401k when I left a certain company and I didn't tell my husband, as he's BAD with money. He sees it and wants to spend it immediately.\nI put it in an account tied to my Edward Jones account and funneled money as I needed.", "She probably won a lottery. I\u2019d be happy as hell if my hubby put a bunch of money in my accounts", "Maybe she won the lottery?", "I assume by her reaction that your wife is not usually a sex worker. So, based on that\u2026 if your wife has never done it before or expressed an an interest in trying it, why on earth would you insinuate that she prostituted herself without any actual evidence? \n\nNot to say that sex work is an inherently evil thing for the people who choose to do it, or find themselves in situations where that is their best or only choice. Zero judgement here.\n\nStill, I agree it\u2019s a LOT of money for a normal person to get in one lump sum, and I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable spending any of it without knowing for sure where it came from. If she won\u2019t tell you then get it out of your joint and personal accounts- she can have it all. That way if the cops ever come investigating that money, you are not an accessory.", "The age gap.

YTA!", "YTA for your assumption lmfao there\u2019s no way she made 30 thousand dollars to her cashapp doing OF or anything you\u2019re mentioning - she probably won the money. She\u2019s probably not telling you (for fun/as a joke like you mentioned) or just didn\u2019t want to give it up to you yet because it was an act of luck (could even be inherited, maybe she got really into sports betting, could be from a sale she made on a piece of jewelry/anything of value you didn\u2019t know she owned) the fact of the matter is she put the money in your joint account and personally sent you some so it\u2019s not like you found out in some mysterious way and you coming at her like she did something wrong or could be a secret prostitute is crazy.", "Is she hot?", "She's selling porn on only fans 100%", "ESH\n\n>I asked her if she did something with her body to get this money\n\nYou very quickly went from a your wife being playful to calling your wife a whore. She clearly misread the room with her lighthearted answer. If this truly was \ud83d\udcaf% innocent, you\u2019ve just planted the seed that you fundamentally don\u2019t trust her. That\u2019s not a small thing to accuse your wife of infidelity.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s suspicious and kinda weird, but you immediately shut down any further conversation by calling her a whore. But you still deserve a more complete answer.\n\nShe clearly didn\u2019t try to hide the money, so I hope it\u2019s something less sinister. Best of luck with this relationship moving forward as it sounds there\u2019s much trust to restore.", "I mean you both have a right to know where the money came from (if it's a huge amount) ESH I don't know why your wife won't tell you but you not thinking about anything else and straight away saying she did something with her body is what surprises me. She is your wife for fucks sake how do you think about your wife in that way", "NTA for wondering, that is bizarre and I\u2019m invested now. While as a woman I fully believe it\u2019s okay for her or anyone to keep emergency money to ourselves - she put it in the joint account\ud83d\ude2d? \n\nCould it have been an accident that she put it in that account instead of her own? But then she sent you money too. I can\u2019t imagine she wouldn\u2019t have just put it in her own account if it was made in a way she didn\u2019t want to tell you. \n\nI would say it\u2019s to send you a message about her independence but it sounds like you\u2019ve been splitting things already. This one is so odd!! **Could it just be a work bonus she wanted to surprise you with sharing?**", "ESH. Jumping to what amounts to an accusation that she is doing sex work is an asshole move. But she's being an asshole for not just being a grown up and informing you of what's going on.\n\nBest case scenario here is she got some unforeseen bonus at work. Making 15k a month at her age I assume she's at a profession that has great bonuses for people in whatever position this is. Other than that the only thing i could think is an inheritance from an unforeseen source.", "Did she do that cash app \"infinite money\" glitch which actually ends up being a delayed overdraft? \ud83d\ude02", "Are you sure you are here only fan?", "I don\u2019t know if you meant 1.5k or if she actually makes 15k a month, if she does make 15k a month\u2026 27k is only 2 months of saving, it\u2019s really not that weird? She just moved it from her personally account for whatever reason. Not telling you why is weird but no reason to assume she was doing sex work.", "I need that job.", "Onlyfans of course", "Jesus, just noticed that. Hope it's a typo and he meant 32, otherwise that's QUITE the age gap.", "It actually wasn\u2019t his first reaction.

You have a right to know where it came from. Jumping to the conclusion she's a prostitute means you're probably not going to be married long.", "He didn't jump to it, he clearly said he asked after trying to ask her at least a couple times before. I mean, a deposit over 20k in the US triggers an audit by the bank and the federal government.\n\nESH for him asking, but it wasn't the first question by far.", "You don\u2019t make 15k a month being a streamer unless you are extremely famous and do it full time.
