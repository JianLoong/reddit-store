Religious differences are huge issues and you need to have that conversation now as to how you and your husband will address yours. What religious holidays will you observe and how will you observe them? If you have kids, how will religion be part of their upbringing?  Many similar questions need to be asked and compromises need to be agreed on.~~\n\n~~In theory he\u2019s also being intolerant of your beliefs if he is insisting on only his pastor says grace. If his religion is being represented then it\u2019s only fair that yours should be as well.

He's not as neutral as he said he'd be and this should be a red flag ESPECIALLY with anyone getting an invite that you both didn't invite, future MIL or not.", "NTA. I have never been to a reception where they had a pastor say grace before people ate. I'd be uncomfortable as hell. It sounds like you already compromised and are getting married at his church, so I don't get his issue. You aren't being \"intolerant\" of his religion, you just don't want the whole day to be church and forcing people who aren't Christian or religious to sit through a prayer before a meal is disrespectful to your guests beliefs if he wants to play that card.", "NTA.

A marriage is a partnership and if he won\u2019t take your feelings on board that\u2019s not a good sign\n\nIt might be best to call this off now before you get down the aisle\u2026.I mean if he bait and switched you with this what other surprises does he have in store for you once you\u2019re married?", "Oof.\n\nNTA , but in an ideal situation this would have been discussed and decided before deciding to marry.\n\n>\\[I\\] feel like religion should be personal.\n\nI agree, and objecting to such a prayer isn't intolerant. OTOH if your fiance thinks prayer helps in any way, that's not something to casually dismiss.\n\nCan some compromise be reached, preferably in agreement with the pastor? I know little about christianity - it's a widely varied religion - but prayer in a private setup away from the general public maybe? Have the pastor give a toast?\n\nETA: Oh, fiance has reneged on an agreement. That doesn't change my view, but it does make fiance TA.

If you think religion should be personal, why is a pastor involved in your wedding? Is he a guest? Did you guys talk about how important religion is in your lives before getting married?", "Raising with universal values implies there is some sort of commonality that both of you recognize in each others traditions, and deem it to be good. You may have chosen to remain agnostic but that doesn't allow the husband or his family to say let's include something religious to make this reception meaningful. Implicitly they're trying to slowly inculcate their religious traits and values and this seems to be the case verily so because the husband switched to a more orthodox stance later on.\n\nThis is not a hill one can compromise on because I doubt your husband or their family would bow down to a Hindu deity in reverence if in the future a ritual is planned for some occasion - baby shower as per cultural Hindu customs, as to how the baby should be named, the horoscope written at the time of birth, none of these are by default contradictory to an agnostic as well, but might offend a Christian, because these go beyond the child's needs and are useful to the entire family's wellbeing, again ties to Dharmic idea of rebirth and karma. \n\nWhether you may or may not embrace rituals in the future, it still stands to say that you need not accept the imposed conveniences at your in-laws since both of you agreed beforehand. Upto you to decide whether to take this forward or not. \n\nNTA", "It\u2019s really easy to hate on religion and those who practice it so I will suggest the issues may be your guy\u2019s dishonesty, his lack of respect for you, and his stubbornness.

NTA\n\nHow you thought a member of one of the more odious and extreme Xtian sects would be able to take off his Jesus goggles and treat you as an equal is beyond me. Leave before he buys you a second hand set of Lagostina pots, gifts you an apron,  knocks you up, and takes away all your shoes.", "NTA, but if you can, postpone the wedding and rediscuss all of the religious aspects to your lives. Your fiance has freedom of religion and is free to change his mind on things, but you need to know about it before doing anything drastic (like get married). \n\nI also think your inlaws are a big influence and he is not setting boundaries, nor is he respecting yours. Be prepared to be outnumbered and overruled in your own house when it comes to taking your future kids to church. You're in for quite the ride if I read this right. Be very worried.", "wait a moment.\n\n\"He wants to have the church pastor say grace before the start of the ceremony\" - Grace is normally said before a meal. \n\n\"But after we got married he changed his stand and he gets upset because I don\u2019t follow him to church and his church members are always asks where am I\"\n\nAre you married or not because it sounds like you're already married.

At the same time, your husband's desire to have a religious blessing may be important to him and reflect his own values and traditions.  \nOne possible solution could be to have a moment of silence or a secular blessing instead, which could allow both of you to honor your beliefs and values without compromising the other. Alternatively, you could consider having a discussion with your husband and his pastor to find a way to include a religious blessing that feels respectful and comfortable for everyone involved.  \nUltimately, it's important to communicate openly and respectfully with each other and find a solution that honors both of your beliefs and values. You are not necessarily the asshole for having a different perspective on this, but it's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding for your husband's perspective as well.", "ESH\n\nReligion is a key part of your Husband's life, and Religion plays no role in your life. How are yall compatible? On the issue of kids, I know it's popular to say that you shouldn't \"force\" them to go to church, but I'd argue that's a matter of opinion, the same as consciously keeping them home from your Husband's church. At the end of the day, yall just aren't aligned on a very big issue.", "ESH for not being able to budge and find a way to give him room for his faith while respecting your desire to distance yourself from religion.\n\nI honestly suggest premarital counseling to help you discuss how you will navigate these differences moving forward, as you can't expect to share a life with him while never coming within 10 ft of his religion.", "YTA. You\u2019re already married but want to have a wedding reception?", "YTA. I mean, in a way you kind of are. This is his day too. You have to be willing to let it be about him too.", "I might be bugging... but aren't weddings a religious event?? YTA. \n\nLet him have that, it's his wedding too.

It's a wedding for both of you and I think either party should have the right of veto.  He compromised on not having a church wedding, you compromised on not having a temple wedding (however if you are agnostic as you say in the comments would giving up a temple wedding mean as much to you?)\n\nEither way you both need to sit down and work these type of issues out now.  Before the marriage.  What do you both want plain and simple without all the honeymoon period sentiments of being happy to give in to the other person.\n\nIf his religion is important to him and your beliefs are important to you there is going to be a big big problem in the future.  Who gives in? Who compromises.  Is it going to be a \"you gave in last time so I will take it this time\" or is it going to be that one of you vetoes everything and the other party has to give in to \"keep the peace\".  That gets old really quickly if you are the one always having to give in to keep the other person happy.\n\nWhat happens if you have children?  What if there are family religious events?  What happens on religious holidays?\n\nI wish you both the best for your upcoming wedding but get that talk out of the way first.", "YTA\u2026 it\u2019s a short prayer, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s making the entire wedding religious.

Some people put on a mask during dating and you don't see their true colors and intentions until marriage. It's pretty disgusting.", "OP stated she is Hindu.
