There's a certain show that he hates with a passion, because it depicts Italian Americans in a negative light, but I used to love the show.\n\n  I've known that my husband hates this show since we met, but I thought he outgrew his disliking for it. The reason it came up again is because a documentary was made about this show, **and I really just wanted to watch the documentary** with him. Why? Because we almost always watch what he wants to. I maybe got excited and wanted to choose what we watched since he often did. I asked him if I could pick something, and made him swear that he would watch it with me, he agreed without knowing.\n\nHe saw what it was, and that's where it went left. He immediately recanted, which annoyed me because the rare time I wanted to choose (regardless of what it was), it became a problem. **I wasn't asking to watch the show, only a doc**. I was hoping he could make a compromise.\n\n  We got into an argument: _My_ point of view was- that we always watch what he wants, and I wanted him to compromise on one thing for me and never again would I ask him to watch anything related to that show.\n\n_His_ point of view was- I was not being respectful of him, and that I was aiding in the mockery of his people. He feels as though Italian Americans are already not taken seriously by both other Americans and Mainland Italians, are stereotyped, and that show made things worse and made them a laughing-stock around the world; I was being disrespectful for even considering asking him to watch the doc with me (knowing how much he hates it), and he then asked how would I feel if he wanted to watch a show that showed people of my ethnicity acting badly.\n\nI answered truthfully, and said \"It bothers me to see people of my ethnicity acting abhorrently, but I'd be a hypocrite to say that I don't watch trash-tv shows with exactly that, because sometimes I do, and so do you. You sometimes wanted to watch those shows (containing people of _my_ ethnicity acting embarrassing) with me, and it wasn't ever a problem then because you didn't relate in that way, so why is this so different?\". \n\nThis response upset him more, but it was true. I did watch shows with people who look like me acting badly (as did he), because it was mindless entertainment and nothing more. Yes, it's damaging to our image but I tended not to internalize it as much, so I felt he was being a hypocrite.\n\n  He felt as though I have no respect for him and what he said. He thinks I do not value how the show makes him feel, and he got extremely upset/hurt by the entire interaction. On the same note, I also feel as though he was a bit tone-deaf in acknowledging _my_ response to him (where I reminded him that the same thing happens in reverse, but I never made a big deal about it), and I thought he outgrew his hatred for the show, so a doc would be different.", "created_utc": 1699362124, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ptsgl/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_watch_a_doc_about_a/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m just curious: \n\nWhy did you feel so strongly that you wanted him to watch the documentary with you? What good were you hoping would come from him watching it? You brought out the big guns to try and get him to watch it when you knew he wouldn\u2019t want to, so you must have had a good reason - what was it? I don\u2019t think you were trying to be mean.

We _always_ watched whatever Dad wanted to watch. Sometimes we could ask, and if it was something Dad was interested in, sure! But if not, tough shit. So I can commiserate with your situation.\n\nAs a tv/movie buff, watching a documentary about the making of a show is very different from watching the _actual_ show. It explains the characters, the ideas, the sets, the casting, the stories, the locations, costuming, hair and makeup (depending on the series), all that good shit. It's like the difference between watching a medical drama and then watching a video of the _actual_ operation. Yeah, they're covering the same topic, but in very different ways. \n\nSure, your husband doesn't have to like every show you like. But if you're _always_ watching shit that he wants, and never/rarely watching what you want, unless he's Jewish and you're forcing him to watch a N@zi propaganda movie or similar, he can suck it up. Or, or, or, and here's a wild idea, _he can go do something else entirely._ Read a book, use the computer, stream something on his own phone/tablet, play a hand of patience (as he clearly needs practice), go for a walk, call his mom, play with cat, _be an adult_. \n\nMy parents are now in their 70s, they've been married for over 50 years, and Dad _still_, _to this day_, gets huffy when Mom asks to watch an episode of one of _her_ shows. He'll put it on, but he'll disengage and as soon as it's over, he'll immediately change it whatever _he_ wants to watch. \n\nAnd for the 'second tv' brigade, not everyone can afford a second tv (especially in this economy), and in my parents case, my mom's eyesight is so bad that she literally has to sit in one specific spot in order to be able to see even a _little_ of the screen. \n\nSo, NTA.", "NTA. If it's the show most of us are probably guessing, it's just a fiction TV show. I don't understand why anyone would be embarrassed by how the characters on a fake show act. I don't see it as being any different than being embarrassed by a show or a movie where the bad guy was white. It doesn't make sense to me. I'm also Italian American. I only worry about my own actions since that is all I can control. I don't understand being embarrassed by what someone else does.

You could have asked him to watch any other show you like, so why did you have to go with this one? You cannot complain that you only watch what he likes if  when it's your time to choose, you are not able to respect him.\nAlso, you said that you have no problem watching shows that are disrespectful to your ethnicity.

The way you\u2019re trying to shoehorn in this \u201cI never get to choose what we watch\u201d also smells like BS.\n\nIf that was the issue, there are a million better ways to deal with it than this. I wouldn\u2019t want my partner to feel that way, if they expressed that I was hogging the selections, I\u2019d absolutely want to adjust to address the discrepancy and make time for their interests on tv - but if they approached it this dishonestly - or tried to force me to watch something I wasn\u2019t comfortable with just to punish or torment me for it (although who can say what\u2019s motivating your nastiness) - I\u2019d instead be re-evaluating my relationship with such a petty, immature person. \n\nIt\u2019s very natural to want to lie and push past people\u2019s boundaries and consent to get what you want - but we all need to take ownership and hold ourselves accountable when it comes to being considerate of others, so we grow out of such behaviours.

Same scenario with the show/documentary. YTA big time for that.", "YTA.  I have a pretty good idea of what the show is and the analogy to your ethnicity doesn't hold up.  That show (about his ethnicity) was held up as an example of the new serious drama and it was so impactful that years later they've made a documentary about it.  It doesn't match the \"trash TV shows(your words)\" about your ethnicity.  More to the point, it isn't just about his ethnicity; it kind of depicts his Entire culture in one specific way.\n\nThen shoehorning the issue of not getting to pick the show you want into this issue is kind of manipulative.  If he felt as strongly about the show back then, why would that have changed now.  Is there really nothing else you could have watched? He might be TA for that reason, but then that issue should've been addressed differently.\n\nAnd then....to watch a documentary about a show you hate??  Documentaries about a show are strictly fan fare.  Literally, the only people who want to watch a documentary about a long cancelled fiction series are the die hard fans.  Even if it wasn't offensive to him from the start, it's kind of mean to make someone watch that kind of show.\n\n  It almost sounds like you wanted to make him miserable as a little revenge for never getting to pick the show.  It's hard to believe you wouldn't know better.\n\nMoreover, you've got no right to judge what he finds offensive.  He has his reasons and common sense dictates you don't force a person to watch shows they find offensive.  The point about your ethnicity is moot here because nobody, in this scenario, is offended.

If you have a problem with always watching shows he wants, have that conversation instead. Tell him you want to pick things to watch too (that don\u2019t bother him an excessive amount, like any other show). You can\u2019t bring up a problem you let slide in an argument to win the argument when you don\u2019t discuss it beforehand. And if it bothers you to watch shows about people that look like you behaving badly, talk about that too wayyyy before this argument. It\u2019s not a tool you use to gain the upper hand. And if you never say anything then it isn\u2019t valid to bring up at that moment.\n\nAnd why do you want to watch it with him if it bothers him? I don\u2019t know about you, but I generally don\u2019t get a kick out of making people I love watch things that make them uncomfortable. If you desperately want to see it, watch it by yourself one day when he isn\u2019t around. If he tells you you can\u2019t see it at all, that\u2019s messed up, but he didn\u2019t. \n\nAnd lastly your attitude in general is just really not it. You snuck it in to do it? \u201cHey watch this with me and promise now OOPS it\u2019s something you don\u2019t like I\u2019m so surprised hehe\u201d really?

It\u2019s not like he just saw something he didn\u2019t like when he was 5 and he\u2019s grown now, something about the show obviously bothers him and the portrayal of people like him does. It\u2019s not unreasonable or something anyone has to \u201coutgrow\u201d.\n\nAgain, if you want to watch more things you like that\u2019s fine! You both deserve equal time. But you also have to watch things with that time that don\u2019t actively make your partner super uncomfortable (and he shouldn\u2019t watch what makes you uncomfortable too). But you have to say these things beforehand, not during a fight to try and force him to watch the thing he hates at that time instead. If it was pretty much anything else I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have agreed to watch it with you (like he did when he promised, sounds reasonable enough to me). And if you don\u2019t like watching shows that show you in a bad light, be honest and tell him you feel the same way about them that he feels about his show. If that doesn\u2019t bother you as much as him, I\u2019m glad because life is less stressful that way, but your experience does not have to be his experience and he is not doing anything wrong by being hurt by it. If he *made* you watch the shows you don\u2019t like and got mad if you didn\u2019t after you expressly told him it bothers you, he shouldn\u2019t make you watch it and if he did he would also be an AH.\n\n(Edit: read the comment that says he guilt trips you into watching things he wants. This is awful behavior. He sucks for this. That\u2019s a terrible thing to do to your partner. You still are TA for what you did, he\u2019s just also TA.

There's a certain show that he hates with a passion, because it depicts Italian Americans in a negative light, but I used to love the show.\n\n  I've known that my husband hates this show since we met, but I thought he outgrew his disliking for it. The reason it came up again is because a documentary was made about this show, **and I really just wanted to watch the documentary** with him. Why? Because we almost always watch what he wants to. I maybe got excited and wanted to choose what we watched since he often did. I asked him if I could pick something, and made him swear that he would watch it with me, he agreed without knowing.\n\nHe saw what it was, and that's where it went left. He immediately recanted, which annoyed me because the rare time I wanted to choose (regardless of what it was), it became a problem. **I wasn't asking to watch the show, only a doc**. I was hoping he could make a compromise.\n\n  We got into an argument: _My_ point of view was- that we always watch what he wants, and I wanted him to compromise on one thing for me and never again would I ask him to watch anything related to that show.\n\n_His_ point of view was- I was not being respectful of him, and that I was aiding in the mockery of his people. He feels as though Italian Americans are already not taken seriously by both other Americans and Mainland Italians, are stereotyped, and that show made things worse and made them a laughing-stock around the world; I was being disrespectful for even considering asking him to watch the doc with me (knowing how much he hates it), and he then asked how would I feel if he wanted to watch a show that showed people of my ethnicity acting badly.\n\nI answered truthfully, and said \"It bothers me to see people of my ethnicity acting abhorrently, but I'd be a hypocrite to say that I don't watch trash-tv shows with exactly that, because sometimes I do, and so do you. You sometimes wanted to watch those shows (containing people of _my_ ethnicity acting embarrassing) with me, and it wasn't ever a problem then because you didn't relate in that way, so why is this so different?\". \n\nThis response upset him more, but it was true. I did watch shows with people who look like me acting badly (as did he), because it was mindless entertainment and nothing more. Yes, it's damaging to our image but I tended not to internalize it as much, so I felt he was being a hypocrite.\n\n  He felt as though I have no respect for him and what he said. He thinks I do not value how the show makes him feel, and he got extremely upset/hurt by the entire interaction. On the same note, I also feel as though he was a bit tone-deaf in acknowledging _my_ response to him (where I reminded him that the same thing happens in reverse, but I never made a big deal about it), and I thought he outgrew his hatred for the show, so a doc would be different.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you said they did bug you and he still wanted to make you watch them, then he'd be a hypocrite.", "I think folks have already covered this specific incident, but it sounds like watching those other shows/not getting voice in what you watch bugs you a lot & maybe that dynamic is one worth talking about with him outside of this specific choice.\n\nLike what you did isn't great, but trying to address this dynamic where you watch stuff you don't like regularly makes sense", "YTA He's not being a hypocrite because the negative stereotypes don't bother you.

I can't really think of any major mainstream character that is unequivocally represented in a positive way. The closest is Joey from Friends, but even in his case when he goes full Italian-American he's terrible. \n\nI personally don't really care enough to be bothered by this (also, I'm not Italian-American) but I can see why your husband might, so saying that you watch shows with people looking like you being bad it's a bit of a moot point, when there aren't any good depictions of Italian-Americans to juxtaposed.", "YTA but at the same time I can\u2019t really bash you since I love to clown Italian Americans especially the ones from the bronx", "YTA.
