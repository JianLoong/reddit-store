I mean I already think you are completely in the right for trying to hold them to their word, but this just makes it so much more shitty. I hope they realize they are being awful by reneging on a financial promise you were likely banking on. \n\nWhat makes it worse is that they\u2019ve reduced your relative to nothing more than a financial gain.", "Talk to a lawyer about whether you have a case to force them to pay (not likely if nothing is in writing, but worth checking just in case).

Just because you have control of the money doesn't mean you can put it wherever you want.  You are the executor because you have to put it where they wanted it, and if you don't...  Oh yeah, the courts can be compelled to smack the ever living bejeezus out of you."]}
