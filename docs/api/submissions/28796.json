This clarifies the situation for me.  These people have concocted a pack of lies to destroy the friendships of the young people involved, because they are losing their hold over them now that they are young adults.  They're off the wall nuts.  \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if there is a pattern of them making things up, and saying them so often that they believe it themselves.\n\nNTA"]}
