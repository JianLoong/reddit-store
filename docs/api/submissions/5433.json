What a sweet request and what an honor for you! The bride gets to choose and she chose you. We read so many horror stories about step siblings in here, I\u2019m so happy to read a heartwarming one.", "These ridiculous rules need to be thrown out.

Fuck them.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\n\nThere's no rule it has to be a parental figure that walks your sister down the aisle.\n\n\nThe rule is that people decide who they want to join them for their wedding. Your sister chose you.\n\n\nI'm assuming that if either of her father figures were better father figures, she'd have picked one of them. She didn't. That's not on you, it's on them.

It's great she has you instead.", "Sorry autocorrect messed up my explanation comment", "NTA. -  her wedding, her choice.

Simple as that.", "So two people who treat her like shit are fighting over a prize neither of them has earnt?\n\nF\\*ck 'em.\n\nEnjoy your role, make sure that you and your sister give her fathers the brightest and happiest of beaming smiles as you process past them and have a great time at the wedding.\n\nThere are so many step-family horror stories on this sub, it makes a refreshing change to read such a post as yours.\n\nYou are NTA, Nina is NTA but, from their reactions, it is clear why she wants neither of her fathers to walk her down the aisle.\n\nHave a great time!", "NTA. She can ask Bozo the Clown to walk her down the aisle, it's HER wedding. You can tell the so-called adults who are whining like toddlers to get over themselves. Don't they want your sister to be HAPPY on her wedding day?", "NTA. That is a beautiful request, and it is entirely her decision to make, and no one else\u2019s. At my wedding a few months ago, my wife and I walked each other down the aisle instead of her dad, and he was completely fine with it. Nothing against him, we just didn\u2019t want to have a traditional ceremony.", "NTA- it\u2019s the brides choice.  Obviously neither man stepped up as a Dad for her. \n\nI read these stories on Reddit about these men who have  neglected their child and then expect to walk them down the aisle.  You rip what you sow.", "NTA. Much as it's hard for some people to understand or accept, it's the bride who gets to decide and this she has done. It sounds like you're thrilled to bits and I love so much that she has chosen you, you must have a fantastic relationship. Hugs to you both.", "> she doesn't have a good relationship with either of them\n\nRemind them of that. They don't get the honor to walk her down the aisle because of that. NTA", "NTA at all. At our last family wedding, our cousin's 13-year-old son walked her down the aisle and then shared a giant hug with his imminent stepdad at the altar - it was so lovely and I don't think there was anyone there who didn't tear up a little bit. It may not be traditional, but it's what your stepsister wants and that's what matters.", "NTA. I\u2019m always amazed by people who don\u2019t put in the work to build a good relationship, then get pissed when they don\u2019t get treated like the loving parent. Sounds like your step sister picked the right guy for the role.", "NTA but stand firm with backing what the ride wants", "NTA\n\nIn fact this isn't even your decision to make - it is completely Nina's choice who she wants walking with her. If Nina works prefer you over her biological or step father then that is her decision to make.\n\nWill there be potentially fallout over this decision? Maybe, but it is not your position to mitigate that, but Nina's to decide if she accepts it or not.", "It is a honour to be the person (not necessarily a man) who walks a bride down the aisle. The bride gets to choose that person. It is not a default role. And it doesn't matter their age! (Seriously WTF?)\n\nIt's wonderful you have such a great relationship with your step-sister. \n\nNTA", "Nta. And be proud that she wants you", "Thank you", "Yeah I see. The problem is (I said it in another comment) that I don't want drama around my sister's wedding and if the fathers won't show up because of this... I forgot to mention that we're from a conservative area where wedding traditions and rules are \"set in stone\"", "I don't want to edit the post just yet but I probably should've mentioned that we're from a very conservative place where people take these made up \"wedding etiquette rules\" way too seriously", "Well the thing is that I don't want conflict during Nina's day, and I fear that some of our family members will probably threaten to not show up because of this.\n\nYeah we have a complicated family to say the least", "Let your step sister make her own decisions about her wedding, don't try to make them for her. Go talk to her. Tell her about the drama and ask her what she wants to do. If she still wants you to walk her down the isle regardless of who decides not to come then do it. And you can tell anyone who asks that you simply are following your step sisters wishes on her wedding day. Trying to decide this for her is insulting af. (It's giving off \"the little lady doesn't understand what she's doing here\" vibes)", "Just talk to your sister. Be honest -- you want to support her, but you don't need to be this role if it causes drama and okay if she's changed her mind. If she still wants you to do it, that's that.", "Perhaps she chose OP to walk her down the aisle to avoid choosing between her step-father and bio-father.  \n\nAs an aside, my asshole father refused to attend my 20-year old sister\u2019s wedding so I walked her down the aisle at 18.  I did that because that\u2019s what my sister wanted.  Do what your (step) sister wants.  NTA.", "Wouldn't that be a good thing then? Family members who are getting so worked up because of a ridiculous tradition of a father giving away his child to her husband don't sound like people that will be missed.", "Thank god someone understands how condescending it is to make other peoples decisions for them.\n.\n\nI do wonder if OP is worried it will damage his relationship with his parents? Sad that they are being mean.", "I agree - the tradition is stupid and sexist.", "NTA.  Her wedding, her decision.  It won't look ridiculous, it will look like the two of you have a beautiful, supportive relationship.", "I think it's great. One of the fathers (step father) was going to be excluded anyway. It was a lose/lose proposition for her having to choose one of them over the other. Might as well choose the person she really wants to walk her down the aisle. Does you also get the first dance before the fathers do? Lol.", "NTA and if she wants cookie monster to walk her down the aisle, so be it. Its her and her partners wedding. They dont require permission from anyone.", "NTA.  Her wedding, her rules.  The parents are more concerned with how it looks and what people will say than asking themselves what they did so wrong that their daughter had excluded them and replaced them with you.  Ignore them and help your sister have the day of her dreams.", "NTA. Obviously she feels you're better suited to the role."]}
