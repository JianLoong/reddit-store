Literally grew up together including them being only 3 days older than I am. Alex got engaged several months ago and the wedding is the weekend before Halloween. I love his fiance, Kelly (30F) she\u2019s a beautiful human. Adam started dating a girl a few weeks ago, Jordan (28F). Jordan is the definition of spoiled brat. Only child who has never been told no and quite obnoxious about daddy\u2019s money.\n\nAlex and Kelly have their wedding planned already and are just waiting for the day to arrive. Ever since Jordan came into the picture she\u2019s been trying to insert herself into the wedding. I\u2019m currently 6 months pregnant with my third and final kid. My other two littles will be ring bearers and my husband and I are both in the wedding party. Jordan has apparently pulled Kelly aside more than a few times asking to replace me as a bridesmaid so I don\u2019t \u201cruin the aesthetic\u201d of the wedding. Kelly declines every time because we\u2019re basically family at this point.\n\nKelly has told me each time she\u2019s done this and spoken to both Alex and Adam. Alex as her fiance has taken her side, but Adam is staying neutral at best, avoidant at worst. My husband and I had both couples over last night for a chill dinner. Jordan immediately upon seeing said I look like a beached whale. So 6 months pregnant, not exactly small but I\u2019m size 6 when not pregnant. I was livid. I told her at some point my belly would go away but she was stuck with her ugly personality and kicked her out of my house.\n\nKelly, Alex and my husband all think I was within my right to throw her out, even if what I said wasn\u2019t exactly nice. Jordan did some more name calling and yelling before dragging Adam by the arm out of the house. I told him he could stay if he wanted and she called me a \u201cboyfriend stealing bitch.\u201d Doesn\u2019t make sense but ok. Today Adam texted me saying I took a low blow and needed to apologize for being as asshole to Jordan. I don\u2019t feel like apologizing, but am curious, was I out of line.", "created_utc": 1697845621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cp1kz/aita_for_throwing_my_friends_girlfriend_out_of_my/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s also obvious that she said that so she can be in the wedding.", "This is verging on a validation post, that\u2019s how NTA you are. That was a brutal riposte that Jordan will be thinking about for years if not the rest of her life. Reminds me of Churchill\u2019s rejoinder to the MP who told him that he was too drunk.\n\n>Winston, you are drunk, and what\u2019s more you are disgustingly drunk.\n\n>Bessie, my dear, you are ugly, and what\u2019s more, you are disgustingly ugly. But tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be disgustingly ugly.", "NTA if she can\u2019t take it she shouldn\u2019t dish it out. Tell Adam she needs to apologize first because you were just responding to her hate filled comment.", "NTA, and good for you.", "NTA.", "NTA.  She tried to usurp your place in your friend's wedding.  She insulted you in your own house after you invited her over.  She tried to stab you in the back, & insulted you and disrespected your hospitality.  How are those not low blows?  You owe her no apology, in fact she should be apologizing to you.  Adam is spineless if he thinks how she treated you is ok.", "NTA. As mentioned before, you could tell Alex you're sorry you couldn't allow her behavior to continue, but this is on her.", "NTA. Adam needs to look at it like this, if someone came to his house and called his girl fat, would he expect his gf to apologize after kicking them out of her home? Maybe Alex needs to sit his brother down and explain how shitty her behavior has been to the other women.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nF that noise. Adam is choosing to endorse her shitty behavior.", "NTA. She was out of line especially since it was at your house. My jaw dropped at ugly personality but honestly I might\u2019ve responded the same way. Adam is just defending his girlfriend but you don\u2019t need to apologize.", "It is on her to apologize, not on you.\n\nCalling a pregnant woman a beached whale... I kind of wonder what she *expected* to happen. \n\nI kind of wonder if Adam has a thing for you. It might give some more context to her \"boyfriend-stealing\" comment and also why she might be being so horrible to you. What she did was unacceptable no matter the reason, but just curious if that might be the case.\n\nNTA.", "[removed]", "NTA. Adam is a doormat and Jordan is an unhinged, entitled brat.", "NTA. You could apologize to Adam for the uncomfortable situation, but only specifically in such a way like \"I'm sorry I couldn't get along with her for your sake; I value your company but I won't tolerate being insulted in my own home.\" \n\nHowever, I'd prioritize NOT implying any apology whatsoever for standing up for yourself and throwing her out. If you can't express your disappointment in losing his company and making things uncomfortable with him without also implying that you're sorry for throwing her out or sorry for what you said to her, then you don't need to apologize at all. Apologizing for the situation is more to soothe the burn and potentially help him see that you're not just making a point; you actually care about spending time with him and wanted to make it work. \n\nThe facts of the situation, as you present them, all put you in the right. It's possible you went overboard in vocal volume, or were more unkind than you \"needed\" to be, but I wouldn't apologize for that. You don't have to assert yourself at the perfect volume/tone. They might be mad you used a clever quip to get the point across, but they'll just have to get over that.", "NTA. Your description of her was spot on therefore you did not hit below the belt.  Now if she had some physical flaw that you insulted, which you did not, then that would be below the belt.  Most snotty people just can\u2019t handle having a mirror put in their face.  I hope she doesn\u2019t last long.", "NTA.  \n\nJordan is obviously trying to replace you with her.  Not even a little bit okay.  \n\nTell Adam that you love him and you want to be happy with him and Jordan, but he needs to take a step back and look at the *facts* of the situation.  The facts here are that Jordan is trying to replace you in the wedding, and came to your house and did a VERY 'low blow' insulting your pregnant body.  \n\nSo if she wants to give you a REAL GENUINE apology for trying to kick you out of the wedding, for overstepping into your friendship with Kelly, and for insulting your body while a guest in your own home, you'll consider apologizing to her for your comment.  Until then, as far as you're concerned, the less you see her the better.  \n\nAnd while you know she's his partner, you suggest he try to mentally step back- imagine that this wasn't someone he loved but just like two random people he knows.  One tries to get the other kicked out of a wedding and, while a guest in that person's home, insults their pregnant body.  Who would he say is 'wrong' there?  It's a rhetorical question you don't want him to answer, just think about.", "NTA. You know who is? Adam, for choosing not to defend his twin brothers fiance and his lifetime friend, but instead for a girl he met a few weeks ago.", "Calling you a beached whale wasn\u2019t a low blow? Her demanding she replace you wasn\u2019t a low blow? There\u2019s an asshole here and an apology owed but you are NTA and don\u2019t owe her anything.", "NTA.  Only thing I can think of is that Adam is thinking with the wrong part of his anatomy. However if it is a long term thing and you want to keep Adam as a friend, then you may want to see if you can come to some sort of truce with Jordan. She may be unaware that you know she has gone out of her way to undermine you with Kelly, so from her perspective your reaction was over the top.", "Isn't it fun when assholes are rude to you, giving you the perfect opportunity to be rude back?\n\nNTA. She had it coming.", "NTA, Jordan is spoiled and pushy about being kelly\u2019s bridesmaid and somehow got offended when she called a woman fat who isn\u2019t and is pregnant. Not even up for discussion.", "NTA. It sounds to me like your friend is blinded by the relationship and whatever Jordan provides him in that relationship. Adam can be told that calling you a \u201cbeached whale\u201d is a step too far, especially when one is a guest in someone else\u2019s home. He might love her or just like her a lot, but Jordan is responsible for facing the consequences of her actions, and it\u2019s unacceptable to expect you to endure insulting behavior in your own home.", "Given everything she has done to show that she views you with nothing but contempt, I would say that telling her \"I'll lose my belly but you won't lose that ugly personality\" was telling her the truth and putting her in her place.  And she most certainly doesn't deserve the honor of being at your house, especially when you're spending time with your friends that feel like siblings to you. NTA.", "NTA \n\nBut, if you think you'll need to save the friendship, you may need to apologize to Adam in maybe a backhanded way? I absolutely can't stand apologies like I'm suggesting here but it might be necessary in order to save the friendship, even if Jordan isn't around for very much longer. \n\nMaybe say something like this: \"Hey, Adam, sorry about the other night. The pregnancy hormones make women more vulnerable to insults, especially when we're dissed for gaining the necessary baby weight.\"\n\nWorth a shot? If not, then let it lie. You may not be missing much.", "Nta you need to explain to Adam how him letting someone insult you is disrespectful to your friendship and if he cannot see that perhaps the friendship is not what you thought it was. You can\u2019t hate her but then excuse Adam for letting this happen. He\u2019s your friend, she isn\u2019t. \n\nRe iterate all she has done and then let him know, you will not engage with a person like her and be done with it", "NTA\nSounds like Adam is picking her side even though you say he\u2019s neutral. Who calls someone pregnant a beached whale? Like?", "NTA. WTF is wrong with Adam?", "NTA - girls like this go their whole lives thinking that daddy\u2019s money is going to make people like them or be the excuse for her bad behavior. If I was the bride, I would tell her fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother that I don\u2019t want her at the wedding because she just sounds like an obnoxious bratty AH.", "Sorry, if a guest walked into my house and immediately insulted me, I\u2019d invite them to leave, too. NTA, but Adam owes everyone she\u2019s been an AH to an apology. No one is obligated to be kind or polite in the face of unkindness and rudeness.", "Adam is backing a girl he's only been dating for **a few weeks**?\n\nYou are NTA but Adam sure is, and color-blind as well if he cannot see the red flag parade this girl is. Trying to insinuate herself into a wedding after **a few weeks**!", "Jordan must be really great at ... things that don't require personality.", "Nta you need to explain to Adam how him letting someone insult you is disrespectful to your friendship and if he cannot see that perhaps the friendship is not what you thought it was.
