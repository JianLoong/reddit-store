Why Ron turned down Evan's offer? Lol. NTA it will be a circus to have all 4 by yourself. Also there are the grandparents, why can't they take care of their grandchildren? TAs everywhere, grandparents come second after parents.", "Sounds like he had options or could have got a babysitter so NTA", "NTA You have a toddler, an infant, and a husband recovering surgery. Your hands are full. Plus, it was a weeknight! Theirs was too big an ask. Also, they told on you to Mom and Dad? They wanted to get you in trouble? Please.", "NTA. He can go with the sibling who offered to babysit - Evan - or hire a sitter. You are not his only option. You don't owe him babysitting.", "Three toddler/preschoolers and a infant is a lot for one person. Considering your husband is recovering from a surgery, right now just isn't a good time, and your brother should understand that. What's wrong with leaving them with the other brother? I don't get it... that would make a lot more sense. NTA. You can return the favor when your husband is well enough to help out.", "NTA\n\n2 threenagers, a 2 year old, and a 6 month old baby is a zoo.  And one of the zookeepers is recovering from major surgery that limits his mobility.  So long as you do return the favor of childcare when circumstances are better, you are not an AH for recognizing that this is too much for you to handle without your husband's help. \n\nThere are plenty of people out there who do not have their own young kids/partners who are recovering from knee surgery who will provide childcare.  Many of them will even come to your house!  An example of one such person is your older brother Evan who even made the offer!  It's not your fault \"Ron\" will only use you for some reason.", "NTA, four kids under the age of three and husband recovering from knee surgery! Not just no, but *heck* no!\n\nThey did not have to miss their date night. Your other brother offered to sit or they could hire a babysitter.", "NTA you your your hands full. Tell your parents they should have done it", "You could return the favor on the weekend. It\u2019s just one night. But only when your husband is fit to help you. That is a situation you are in the moment. He is gonna have to wait. Or he can accept Evan. You are NTA", "NTA\n\nreturning the favour is an option when it works for you...he doesn't get to demand when it happens.\n.\n\nYou are also looking after husband....and I would not do 4 kids by myself either.", "NTA - just because your husband is recovering from surgery & can't help out.  They should be understanding about that. \n\nIn general, if someone else is watching your kids, you better return the favor if they ask.", "NTA. I feel like you\u2019re not saying \u201cno, not ever\u201d, just \u201cunder the circumstances, no\u201d. It\u2019s pretty entitled of your brother to expect so much on a week night given your husbands condition and your baby.", "NTA\n\nWhy didn\u2019t your parents watch them? Why didn\u2019t Ron actually HIRE a babysitter? I\u2019m guessing that if your DH were more mobile, you would have, but 3 toddlers, an infant and a DH in pain? Nah.", "NTA \n\nI think you are not TA on this occasion as your husband is recovering. However, if you accept them babysitting your kids you should expect to return the favour, even if their kids are badly behaved.", "if you continue to have him watch your kids, then absolutely YTA.  it sounds like you are going through quite a bit, but if he (or his wife) are watching your kids (are you paying them to do so?) then that def makes you an AH.", "He watches your kid, but you won\u2019t watch his?
