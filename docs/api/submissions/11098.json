He can go with the sibling who offered to babysit - Evan - or hire a sitter. You are not his only option. You don't owe him babysitting.", "Three toddler/preschoolers and a infant is a lot for one person. Considering your husband is recovering from a surgery, right now just isn't a good time, and your brother should understand that. What's wrong with leaving them with the other brother?

And one of the zookeepers is recovering from major surgery that limits his mobility.  So long as you do return the favor of childcare when circumstances are better, you are not an AH for recognizing that this is too much for you to handle without your husband's help. \n\nThere are plenty of people out there who do not have their own young kids/partners who are recovering from knee surgery who will provide childcare.  Many of them will even come to your house!  An example of one such person is your older brother Evan who even made the offer!

When he did you a favor, it was at a time that was convenient for him. When you return it, you get to decide when it\u2019s good timing for you. Which is not when your husband just had knee surgery.

It's ridiculous that \"Ron\" and your parents think you could possibly take on two more kids, especially when \"Ron\" and his wife are clearly not teaching them social skills.  I've had surgery on both knees.  I wouldn't want those kids anywhere near me.  I'd be terrified they'd run into my knee or jump on it or something.  That's the last thing you and your husband need.\n\nYour brother and SIL must not have wanted to go out all that badly.  I mean, \"Ron\" turned \"Evan\" down with no explanation whatsoever.  I'm guessing he's babysat your 3y old on occasion with no problems.  \n\nHere's an even better idea.  They're going out with two couples from their \"parenting group.\"  Why don't \"Ron\" and SIL ask around.  Surely someone in the group could recommend a reliable sitter.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02how are you going to plan a date then ask your family member to babysit?
