My wife says I'm asking her to \"mask\".", "selftext": "[here is the original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bx2pa/aita_my_wife_says_im_asking_her_to_mask/)\n\nokay so it turns out that I was a little bit of an AH. Like nothing wild but we had a good talk.\n\nHere is what she said to me: being a teacher is hard. Being a teacher with untreated ADHD is even harder. She said she spends all day trying to contain her brain from doing what it naturally does, which is veer off in random directions that may or may not be relevant to a given conversation.\n\nSo she does that all day. And she literally looks forward to coming home so she DOESN'T have to do that. Me bringing it up in the context of how we interact at night hurt her feelings because us-interacting-time is her space where she can just let her brain be her brain. Is \"masking\" the right term there? idk, she apologized for using it because she saw it on social media and thought it fit but it might not.\n\nshe felt bad for dominating the conversation, though, because she's not a monster. And she says she lashed out because she felt bad, but also didn't want to lose access to the time of the day in which she is not fighting with her own brain.\n\nWe decided to use advice I received here in amitheasshole: I will go first when we talk at the end of the night. If I regularly go \"over time\" then we will start using a phone timer to make sure everyone has time to talk. And she will try to work more interaction into her stories so my role isn't just saying mmhmm yeah mmhmm over and over.\n\nThank you for the advice, we are using it and we are confident that it will work.", "created_utc": 1698255028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ga86t/update_aita_my_wife_says_im_asking_her_to_mask/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Is treating her ADHD not an option? I think you've got a good compromise for your original issue, but I found myself to have further personal growth once I got mine treated. And it doesn't always mean getting on medication, I and others have had a lot of success with behavioral therapy (although my therapist thinks my \"thought trees\" is more of a cPTSD symptom)\n\nI related to your wife a lot in the first post because I also would *seriously* digress in personal conversations, hence I nicknamed my habit \"thought trees\": where the trunk is the topic but all the branches were side comments/digressions\n\nNAH and it sounds like y'all have good communication channels", "That's nice and you seem like a good husband but also she should really get treated. It won't change who she is, it'll just make her life EASIER. Speaking from experience.", "How wonderful that you are able to speak to each other about such topics so calmly. \n\nHer days sound very hard. However, her being untreated is her choice. She doesn\u2019t get to use up all her self control at work and then just \u201cblahhhhhh\u201d once home. \n\nI\u2019m a special ed teacher so A) I know how tough teaching is and also I frequently have students who are in the exact boat as your wife. They work so hard during the school day (yay! We are so proud!) but then at home it is quite difficult, because they have nothing left. And that makes for many unhappy people in the family, and frankly a family held hostage by the dysregulation of one person. So we work as a team- school staff, medical providers, therapists, family- to find ways to support regulation and growth so that life is not so stressful for everyone. Good luck to you both, you seem like a really loving and committed couple.", "Good on you both for working on a solution.", ">Being a teacher with untreated ADHD is even harder.\n\nAnd whose fault is it that she's untreated? Is she even seeking treatment? No sympathy at all toward someone who uses her diagnosis to steamroll others while not getting treatment.", "Something my partner and I do that might be good if you guys continue to struggle with this (we\u2019re both ND), is take turns sharing first each night. We don\u2019t do it perfectly like \u201cI share tonight, you share tomorrow\u201d but we try to be conscious of who went first most recently, so the other person can have more time soon. This works better for us than trying to time our stories. So it\u2019s just a thought that might help!", "I 100% agree. My life got better with treatment. I can be a much better partner. I've had some trouble with my prescription this summer so I've had to white knuckle it through life more. Harder for me and for everyone else. Treatment is such a boon.", "\u201cNot having access to medication, understanding doctors, & the cost of diagnosis is a choice\u201d sure is cute", "As a teacher, you should also be aware of how terrible the health insurance is for teachers, as well as how terrible the pay is.", "When I'm paying more than $4 a day for the privilege of medicating my brain into a societally acceptable state (that's $4.15 a day after all of the manufacturer support programs I have availed myself of), you can *say* that being untreated is a choice... but you know what else worsens my ADHD symptoms... not having enough money for food.\n\nAnd that's after years of having had medical and mental health providers dismiss me, being on endless waitlists and having to fight tooth, nail and wallet just to get a diagnosis that wasn't \"anxiety probably, lol\".\n\nI'm happy that the families you support have access to a multidisciplinary team who are on their side, but please keep your judgements to yourself if you don't know the journey someone's had to go through to even be at the point where they can say, \"Spouse, please make accommodations for my untreated ADHD.\"", "Medication cost money.\n\nRegular visits to a prescriber cost money. \n\nNot all medications work the same for everyone.\n\nNot everyone can take medications that work for them due to other health concerns or interactions with other medications. \n\nThere is notably a massive months-long shortage of many ADHD medications. \n\nMedications wear off.", "You have no idea what her treatment is. You don't know if she's taking meds (you know they... wear off... right?). You don't know if she's in therapy. You don't know if she's tried meds and had bad reactions to them. You don't know if she's incapable of taking anything because of another health issue. You don't know if she is trying to use medication but can't afford them or is being fucked over by the meds shortage going on.\n\nYou know absolutely nothing about this woman.", "Will you be paying the thousands of dollars it costs to get diagnosed with ADHD as an adult then?", "Treatment doesnt work for everyone. I have untreated adhd because none of the medication available here worked.", "yeah lol even with insurance and a coupon my adhd meds rn cost $300+ a month. this is a valid point to bring up.", "Yikes! Sorry, that really sucks. Makes me grateful that I'm *only* paying what I do."]}
