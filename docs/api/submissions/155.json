He and I were disagreeing a lot this entire Halloween day for multiple reasons. I arrived at his house after we both calmed down and we were just having a conversation about what was going on. I was mostly quiet today because of this. As we were just having small talk his sister (21) has a dog that took a hair clip and when he tried to get it back the dog attacked him. The dog bit him pretty badly. His sister was comforting the dog and he told her that she should be trying to help him and not the dog which caused an argument. His mom steps in and tells him to calm down and just wash his hands. He then started tearing up because everyone blamed him for getting bit which caused his mom to blow up even more.\nShe told him to \" man up \" and called him names and then said \" stop crying over dumbass little b!tches too and be a man\". I felt extremely uncomfortable witnessing this but I ignored the comments just assuming it was out of anger. We both stepped in the bathroom to wash his hand and he apologized repeatedly and cried even more. I told him it's fine, families argue all the time. But then his mom called us out of the bathroom and started screaming at me. She said her daughter (12) witnessed everything and she's crying and how it's my fault that this all happened and how I need to leave her house for being disrespectful. She called me a b!tch multiple times and told me to break up with him or go outside to find someone else to act disrespectful towards. She also insisted that I am the reason their family has been arguing more because he just so happens to be angrier more often now than before and that I am not the girl for him and that he needs to leave me. I was quiet the entire time this was happening. My boyfriend was yelling at her to stop the whole time and that it wasn't her business what we argued about and she should just leave it to us to figure out our relationship. His older sister (26) went to grab her and tell her to calm down which she slightly did. As she walked away she was still calling me names and saying how much she dislikes me and then said \" go the f!ck home Goodnight \" . He walked me out the house still crying, and we talked about possibly breaking up. He told meit's best if I stop coming over and we just go to my house or somewhere else to avoid further issues. I'm not sure if AITA but his sister (21) that I am friends with also agreed with her mom and told me I was wrong for being disrespectful in their home. Also this isn't the first time his mom has picked an argument with me. I never respond back actually, instead I always apologize for even upsetting her in any way. I have told him to talk to his mom and sort things out with his entire family before he decides to invite me over (which I will not be going to).\nEdit: the arguments were through text mostly, in person it was whispering.", "created_utc": 1667275077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiy464/aita_for_being_disrespectful_to_my_mil/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had to stop and re-read when you said he started crying at the start. *Dogs won't bite unless they are defending someone/something or have been hit by someone and/or feel threatened,* so it's weird how you described the dog just bit him for getting a hair tie... his sister was right to comfort the dog\n\n1. It calmed the dog down so it wouldn't nip again\n\n2. If it did bite because it felt it was protecting his sister, this would show the dog everything is ok\n\n3. Last thing you want to do when an animal is upset and has bitten someone/something, is yell scream and shout at it, would definitely scare the dog and provoke it.\n\nHis mother sounds like a piece of work with how she treated you verbally, but I can't say much when you said he discussed possibly breaking up with you because of his mothers' toxicity. \n\nMy advice: you're young and have a **very** long life ahead of you still. If this is how a relationship with him shows respect, look elsewhere. It's good when men show emotions and feel comfortable crying in front of someone they love... but it shouldn't be easily triggered", "Honestly I knew my friend would choose family over me but it still sucked to hear it but thank you we\u2019ll both try our best to avoid further issues with his mom in the future :)", "She said me and him arguing in general is considered disrespectful", "NTA, she sounds like she has some serious issues. You should stop going over there and avoid her as much as possible. Try to support your boyfriend, it must be hard dealing with a mother like that.", "Were you guys arguing in her house? Was any of the arguing loud?", "Thank you I\u2019ll try my best to avoid it honestly", "It was through text and no actually it was whispering mostly?", "She sounds crazy, so I am going to say NTA."]}
