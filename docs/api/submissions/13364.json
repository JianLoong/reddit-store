Esty and I didn\u2019t know that the other existed until 5 months ago when I had to go to the hospital for stitches. We share a dad and he came in just as she was discharging me \u2013 my mum was with me. Our surname is common. My mum didn\u2019t even know that he had an older daughter.\n\nSince finding out, I have wanted to know more about my sister. I\u2019ve always wanted a sibling but I\u2019m an only child. I could have done with a big sister guiding me and it turns out that I had one all along. All my dad has said is that her late mum turned her against him. He refuses to talk about her, but I did find out that they\u2019ve had no contact since she was about 16. I found Esty on FB and Insta so I reached out to her. She didn\u2019t answer my first couple of messages on FB, but she only responded after I started liking some pictures on her Insta as its public. When she responded she asked that I stopped liking her pictures, she has since made that account private and blocked me. I responded with asking her questions as there were pictures of her and her partner, and her kids. I wanted to know more about my niblings and about her. Esty responded telling me to leave her alone as she wasn\u2019t interested in forging a relationship with dad or \u2018the spawn of Satan\u2019. I was offended at this and started asking her what dad had done for her to be so hostile because he was nothing but nice to me and mum. Esty told me once more to stop messaging her and to leave her alone. She then blocked me.\n\nOn my way home from my job at the weekend, I dropped by the hospital where she works to see if she was there, to see if we could talk. Even if just for a minute. Esty saw me as she was leaving and got mad. I told her that I only wanted a minute to talk to her so I could find out more about my sister. She told me that I was just like dad and that I needed to leave her alone as she had no interest in forging a relationship with me. She told me that if I turned up again when I didn\u2019t need treatment she would be getting the receptionist to call security and have me removed. When I got home, I mentioned that I saw Esty to my parents but that she had threatened to call security. Mum told me that Esty maybe just needed time and I shouldn\u2019t have turned up at her work but dad thinks I did the right thing as Esty was being rude by pushing me away.\n\nAITA for turning up at my sister\u2019s work?\n\nEdit: I received a message this morning from my uncle (Dad's older brother who dad isn't close with). He had seen this post. Those of you who guessed that Dad left Esty and her mum for mine, were wrong. Apparently Dad wasn't nice to Esty and her mum, but it got worse after an accident when Esty was 13 which resulted in her losing a lot of her hearing and having to wear hearing aids. My uncle said that he had heard my dad refer to Esty as defective a few times because she was deaf. Esty's mum put her into private therapy to help her come to terms with what had happened and to help get be able to communicate again. Dad tried several times to remove this saying that Esty didn't deserve it. The following year, Dad went to prison for a year and when he was in prison her mum filed for divorce. They moved away. Dad and Esty used to keep in touch via letters (her's went to my uncle's because her mum didn't want him to know where they were), but when she turned 16 she stopped after Dad wrote her a letter telling her that he wanted her to keep away from him as my mum was expecting me and he didn't want 'her defectiveness to rub off on the new baby'. \n\nI didn't know my dad could be so cruel. Esty seems lovely, but now I get why she doesn't want contact. I wish I had left her alone. I didn't want to know this about my dad.", "created_utc": 1679961880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1245wzf/aita_for_turning_up_at_my_sisters_work_after_she/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The FIRST thing people need in any kind of relationship is safety (both physical and emotional), and by completely ignoring very clear boundaries, you have done some damage.\n\nOh, and your dad thinks she was rude to push you away? THAT'S HER CHOICE. I guess you were raised by a father who ignores boundaries, so maybe you think that's normal, but IT'S NOT. It's not your right to decide that anyone else is rude for setting boundaries.\n\nYour dad is the wrong person to listen to, and it makes perfect sense that your sister compared you to him.\n\nYou have probably got a lot of lessons from your childhood to unlearn as you grow up.

You are old enough to realize that stalking someone who has repeatedly told you to stop is wrong.  You could find yourself in legal trouble with a restraining order against you if you do not stop immediately.\n\nI understand you want a relationship with your older sister.

Not to mention you made some very questionable and immature decisions that ultimately led to you stalking someone. \n\nSpeaking from my own personal experience here. My mother had me at 17 and raised me on her own. My sperm donor ran off when he realized she was pregnant. I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s a high probability that I have other siblings and family, but I have no desire to ever be in contact with them. This adult man took advantage of my mom, a literal child, then skipped town. I\u2019m the byproduct of that. My mom has always tried her hardest to provide for me. It wasn\u2019t perfect, I had a nightmare of a stepfather, but I digress. I want nothing to do with my biological father, his family, or any of his offspring. If I ever had the displeasure of being contacted by one of them, I\u2019d immediately ask them to leave me alone and block them. I want nothing to do with a family I\u2019ve never known, especially now that I\u2019m in my 30s with my own family. I don\u2019t need the headache of that nonsense. \n\nLikewise, your sister has chosen to not make contact with her father or his new family. I understand you want to connect, but the decision to reciprocate is hers to make. You can\u2019t just show up at her job and force a relationship when one isn\u2019t wanted. I think she was a little harsh towards you if you aren\u2019t embellishing\u2026but if I had to guess, there\u2019s some unresolved trauma rearing its ugly head there. And you did ambush her at work. Respect your sister\u2019s wishes. Accept that you won\u2019t be able to forge a relationship that isn\u2019t wanted, and resign yourself to the fact that your father did something she can\u2019t forgive.

YTA.\n\nI\u2019m also curious as to why your dad kept this to himself for so long. This romanticized fantasy of having an older sister in your life is not reality. She\u2019s a stranger and she\u2019s asked you to leave her alone. All I see in your post is consideration for what YOU want. Esty\u2019s feelings have been repeatedly dismissed by you. You\u2019re lucky she doesn\u2019t get a restraining order.", "The dad\u2019s opinion indicates that he\u2019s a boundary-stomper who doesn\u2019t care what Esty wants.

Maybe dad has other children out there who would be happy to be siblings with OP?\n\nYTA, OP. Maybe eventually Esty will want to learn more about you, if she does she'll contact you then. You're skating dangerously close to getting a restraining order if you continue to contact someone who has been clear that she does not want to be contacted by you, and going to her place of work is absolutely out of line. Biologically you two are related, but you don't have a relationship. Her children aren't your nieces and nephews beyond the genetic component. I completely understand wanting to know your half sister, but she doesn't want to know you. This is one of those 'two yeses or one no' situations. If she doesn't want to know you that's it, there's nothing else to do and trying to reason with her is inappropriate. \n\nAlso Esty clearly works in urgent care or an ER. She's stressed, she's busy.

She may have just found out about an affair or they split ways and the dad just knocked someone up immediately after.", "Contacting her on social media, email, text, whatever is one thing - sure, reach out to try to connect. But if she says no, respect that. Showing up at her work??? At a HOSPITAL??? After she has already clearly said no? Absolutely not. You were way over the line, and you\u2019ve likely damaged a chance to connect.", ">I\u2019m also curious as to why your dad kept this to himself for so long\n\nSounds like OP thinks dad is great and completely relies on his opinion for morality issues, I'm guessing if half sister's experience with dad had been relayed to OP's mom when OP was younger OP would have a very different view of the father. Says a lot that mom is the voice of reason when dealing with her daughter stalking the daughter she didn't know her husband had, while OP thinks there are no issues with it as long as dad is supportive", "All very true! I sincerely hope OP leaves the sister alone. I get how painful this must be but OP needs to learn no means no.

Your comment was unhelpful and you keep saying that you're just doing this or that, when in reality you're framing your response in a terrible way. Being called out on that sort of thing happens all the time here, sweet pea.\n\nHon, no one is suggesting that OP shouldn't be curious. Of course OP is curious, but once she was blocked and told \"no\" she needed to stop trying to make contact. She was made aware at that point that she was not welcome and continued stalking the woman anyway. \n\nMuffin, whether the OP meant harm or not, she caused it. Just as if I were to accidentally step on your foot: I would have harmed you even though I wouldn't have meant to. Precious, do you understand how that happens? How someone can have the best of intentions and still hurt someone? That someone's intentions don't excuse the impact of their actions? It's a hard thing to understand, buttercup, but I'm sure you can do it.\n\nBabe, being empathetic doesn't just mean supporting one side of a story, or dividing the story into good and bad, because life is not so rigid. Being empathetic means recognizing the emotions and feelings someone has and validating those feelings, without casting anyone as a villain or hero and without supporting the actions.

Leave her alone.", "Dear, do the math. Your dad and her mom were probably in a relationship when he met your mother and started dating. You're 16, she's 33. She stopped talking to him at 16.

That alone makes him a deadbeat and absolutely not someone whose advice you should be taking on how to handle this. Given the timing it\u2019s also likely that he had an affair with your mother and left Esty and her mother to start your family, or at the very least he abandoned his daughter once he had a new one on the way.\nNow on to your behaviour. Reaching out is one thing, but you completely trampled her boundaries. She ignored your messages, which made her feelings clear enough that you should have left her alone. When she *asked* you to leave her alone you ignored her wishes and asked invasive questions that are honestly none of your business. Esty had every right to respond to this with hostility. To then go and show up at her work is *beyond* inappropriate - she would be entitled to have you arrested. This is harassment.

I'm sorry you aren't getting that hallmark beautiful moment you seem to be craving with the sister you've always wanted.  But you could have started this whole thing differently, more kindly, and with more understanding and patience.  By saying something more along the lines of, I'm sorry you don't know me, and I'm not expecting anything, I'm just hoping to get to know you.  I understand if you don't want to know me because of our shared father, but we don't have to talk about him at all.  I honestly just want to get to know more about you and your life if and when you're ready.  We can even just keep messaging via Facebook or emails if that is your preference, or however you feel most comfortable.  Then just leave it in her court to ponder.\n\nYou might have heard something from her eventually by going at this in a different way.  But you came at her like a wrecking ball, so hard and determined, that it more than likely scared her off.  And your inability to take no for an answer is a problem.  You may need to seek some counseling to help you understand boundaries.  Because she has the right to say no, I don't want to get to know you or have you know me.

For example, why did your father keep his first child a secret? And why does he refuse to talk about it and only say his ex turned his child against him. Is your mother ok with him having kept this too? It's possible there was some kind of domestic violence or sexual assault involved here. Honestly, calling your father Satan is not generally something people do lightly.", "Isn\u2019t this a Grey\u2019s Anatomy episode? \n\n\nEither way, can\u2019t force a relationship.

It is both terrible parenting, and honestly criminally negligent, to knowingly allow your child to do something which could land them in jail.\n\nYour mom is acting correctly by telling you to stop.  She should be telling you MUCH more explicitly, but I don't know how much of that being underplayed is her and how much is your description of the situation.\n\nYour dad is not acting correctly.  Your dad is, in fact, acting like a huge asshole, and again arguably a criminal, by encouraging you to keep committing a crime.  It is 100% more sketchy for him to do so, because the crime you're committing is harassing his estranged daughter.  It seems like, if anything, he is encouraging you to continue because he benefits from it.  Either because he thinks he can punish her for treating him like \"Satan\" by using you as a proxy to harass her, or because he thinks he can extort something out of her by having you try to drag her into a relationship.  Both are grotesque behaviors, and should be huge red flags to you as to which set of advice you should be following.  \n\nDo you think it's a good thing that your father is encouraging you to do something that could land you in jail?\n\nLeave her alone.", "She repeatedly asked you to leave her alone, and you repeatedly ignore her request, then ask if YTA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, YTA.

So you probably got the relationship she always wanted but will never have.  So you represent a lot of pain and anguish, and she doesn\u2019t want to be reminded of that every time she sees you.
