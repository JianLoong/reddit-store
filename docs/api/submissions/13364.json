Esty and I didn\u2019t know that the other existed until 5 months ago when I had to go to the hospital for stitches. We share a dad and he came in just as she was discharging me \u2013 my mum was with me. Our surname is common. My mum didn\u2019t even know that he had an older daughter.\n\nSince finding out, I have wanted to know more about my sister. I\u2019ve always wanted a sibling but I\u2019m an only child. I could have done with a big sister guiding me and it turns out that I had one all along. All my dad has said is that her late mum turned her against him. He refuses to talk about her, but I did find out that they\u2019ve had no contact since she was about 16. I found Esty on FB and Insta so I reached out to her. She didn\u2019t answer my first couple of messages on FB, but she only responded after I started liking some pictures on her Insta as its public. When she responded she asked that I stopped liking her pictures, she has since made that account private and blocked me. I responded with asking her questions as there were pictures of her and her partner, and her kids. I wanted to know more about my niblings and about her. Esty responded telling me to leave her alone as she wasn\u2019t interested in forging a relationship with dad or \u2018the spawn of Satan\u2019. I was offended at this and started asking her what dad had done for her to be so hostile because he was nothing but nice to me and mum. Esty told me once more to stop messaging her and to leave her alone. She then blocked me.\n\nOn my way home from my job at the weekend, I dropped by the hospital where she works to see if she was there, to see if we could talk. Even if just for a minute. Esty saw me as she was leaving and got mad. I told her that I only wanted a minute to talk to her so I could find out more about my sister. She told me that I was just like dad and that I needed to leave her alone as she had no interest in forging a relationship with me. She told me that if I turned up again when I didn\u2019t need treatment she would be getting the receptionist to call security and have me removed. When I got home, I mentioned that I saw Esty to my parents but that she had threatened to call security. Mum told me that Esty maybe just needed time and I shouldn\u2019t have turned up at her work but dad thinks I did the right thing as Esty was being rude by pushing me away.\n\nAITA for turning up at my sister\u2019s work?\n\nEdit: I received a message this morning from my uncle (Dad's older brother who dad isn't close with). He had seen this post. Those of you who guessed that Dad left Esty and her mum for mine, were wrong. Apparently Dad wasn't nice to Esty and her mum, but it got worse after an accident when Esty was 13 which resulted in her losing a lot of her hearing and having to wear hearing aids. My uncle said that he had heard my dad refer to Esty as defective a few times because she was deaf. Esty's mum put her into private therapy to help her come to terms with what had happened and to help get be able to communicate again. Dad tried several times to remove this saying that Esty didn't deserve it. The following year, Dad went to prison for a year and when he was in prison her mum filed for divorce. They moved away. Dad and Esty used to keep in touch via letters (her's went to my uncle's because her mum didn't want him to know where they were), but when she turned 16 she stopped after Dad wrote her a letter telling her that he wanted her to keep away from him as my mum was expecting me and he didn't want 'her defectiveness to rub off on the new baby'. \n\nI didn't know my dad could be so cruel. Esty seems lovely, but now I get why she doesn't want contact. I wish I had left her alone. I didn't want to know this about my dad.", "created_utc": 1679961880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1245wzf/aita_for_turning_up_at_my_sisters_work_after_she/", "score": 530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The FIRST thing people need in any kind of relationship is safety (both physical and emotional), and by completely ignoring very clear boundaries, you have done some damage.\n\nOh, and your dad thinks she was rude to push you away? THAT'S HER CHOICE. I guess you were raised by a father who ignores boundaries, so maybe you think that's normal, but IT'S NOT. It's not your right to decide that anyone else is rude for setting boundaries.\n\nYour dad is the wrong person to listen to, and it makes perfect sense that your sister compared you to him.\n\nYou have probably got a lot of lessons from your childhood to unlearn as you grow up.

The word for what you're doing is stalking. This woman is a complete stranger to you, no matter that you share genes.

You are old enough to realize that stalking someone who has repeatedly told you to stop is wrong.  You could find yourself in legal trouble with a restraining order against you if you do not stop immediately.\n\nI understand you want a relationship with your older sister.

Not to mention you made some very questionable and immature decisions that ultimately led to you stalking someone. \n\nSpeaking from my own personal experience here. My mother had me at 17 and raised me on her own. My sperm donor ran off when he realized she was pregnant. I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s a high probability that I have other siblings and family, but I have no desire to ever be in contact with them. This adult man took advantage of my mom, a literal child, then skipped town. I\u2019m the byproduct of that. My mom has always tried her hardest to provide for me. It wasn\u2019t perfect, I had a nightmare of a stepfather, but I digress. I want nothing to do with my biological father, his family, or any of his offspring. If I ever had the displeasure of being contacted by one of them, I\u2019d immediately ask them to leave me alone and block them. I want nothing to do with a family I\u2019ve never known, especially now that I\u2019m in my 30s with my own family. I don\u2019t need the headache of that nonsense. \n\nLikewise, your sister has chosen to not make contact with her father or his new family. I understand you want to connect, but the decision to reciprocate is hers to make. You can\u2019t just show up at her job and force a relationship when one isn\u2019t wanted. I think she was a little harsh towards you if you aren\u2019t embellishing\u2026but if I had to guess, there\u2019s some unresolved trauma rearing its ugly head there. And you did ambush her at work. Respect your sister\u2019s wishes. Accept that you won\u2019t be able to forge a relationship that isn\u2019t wanted, and resign yourself to the fact that your father did something she can\u2019t forgive.

YTA.\n\nI\u2019m also curious as to why your dad kept this to himself for so long. This romanticized fantasy of having an older sister in your life is not reality. She\u2019s a stranger and she\u2019s asked you to leave her alone. All I see in your post is consideration for what YOU want. Esty\u2019s feelings have been repeatedly dismissed by you. You\u2019re lucky she doesn\u2019t get a restraining order.", "The dad\u2019s opinion indicates that he\u2019s a boundary-stomper who doesn\u2019t care what Esty wants.

Maybe dad has other children out there who would be happy to be siblings with OP?\n\nYTA, OP. Maybe eventually Esty will want to learn more about you, if she does she'll contact you then. You're skating dangerously close to getting a restraining order if you continue to contact someone who has been clear that she does not want to be contacted by you, and going to her place of work is absolutely out of line. Biologically you two are related, but you don't have a relationship. Her children aren't your nieces and nephews beyond the genetic component. I completely understand wanting to know your half sister, but she doesn't want to know you. This is one of those 'two yeses or one no' situations. If she doesn't want to know you that's it, there's nothing else to do and trying to reason with her is inappropriate. \n\nAlso Esty clearly works in urgent care or an ER. She's stressed, she's busy.

You should NEVER show up to where someone works.", "She is clearly isn't interested, so you need to let her go. \nFind friends that will want to guide you in life, you don't need there to be blood just for the sake of it.", ">I didn't know my dad could be so cruel. Esty seems lovely, but now I get why she doesn't want contact. I wish I had left her alone. I didn't want to know this about my dad.\n\nMaybe it's best that you learned this. You deserved to know the truth. Now, you won't be blindsided if he ever ends up treating you the same way. It also taught you a very valuable lesson that people aren't always what they seem and that you shouldn't judge people for wanting distance from their own family because you might not know how they were treated.", "YTA - So you are 16 and you don't know that NO means no? Why do you think you are so entitled to her time when she has asked you and repeatedly told you to leave her alone. Just because you wanted a sister doesn't mean she has to be that person for you. I am going to tell you are hard truth that it seems  your parents never taught you. Your wants do not out weigh any one else's. It doesn't matter that you are only 16 you are old enough to know that you cannot have your way every time and that it is high time that you learn to respect others. time to grow up a little bit and quit stalking this poor woman.", "I know you wish you didn't know, but...it's probably good you do.

Does \"in sickness and in health\" only apply when it's going to be him?\n\nYou stalked a woman, and you shouldn't have done that. At most, you *might* be able to ask your uncle to pass along an apology, but **that is it**.\n\nThis poor woman has been abandoned and traumatized by your father. You're fortunate, so far, that things have been good between you, but please take his opinions and advice with a big grain of salt from now on. YTA\n\nEdit to add: the fact his ex wife waited until he was safely tucked away in prison to divorce him and carefully guarded their location screams abuse victim to me. Just another thought. Be careful.", "Not only that, but since you seem to have trouble understanding this part, stalking and harassmebt are CRIMES. \n\nI read your edit and am glad, for you,that you got the abswers you wanted.

It doesn't matter what her reasons are. It has nothing to do with you.  Stop making this about you. she is not your family, they are not your nibblings. accept it and move on before you become a stalker with legal troubles.
