Sure maybe it\u2019s lame excuses, but sounds like neither of you care to continue a relationship", "NTA, BUT\n\nIf so many people decide to ghost you on your wedding or find lame excuses on short notice- there is usually a reason. We don't know this reason and if it is on them or on you. They may have thought, quietly ghosting you was a kind of \"damage controlled\" punishment, or whatever. If this is justified or not is not on us (or you for that matter) to decide. They chose how they want to react towards you. But putting them under pressure may change their mind.\n\nIf you choose to publicly call THEM out- they may feel pressured to disclose their reasoning just as publicly. Depending on said reason, it may harm YOUR reputation more than ghosting you damaged THEIRS.", "NTA but I wouldn't bother to be honest. \n\nI'd move on without them. They've made it clear about what they think of you and your wife. So It's probably not going to change anything either way.", "INFO Does your wife want you to? Have you discussed it with her?", "YTA if anyone should call them out it should be your wife. There is no need for you to do or say anything here especially if your wife hasn't asked you too. Also what is the benefit for calling them out. If they don't want a relationship just don't initiate any contact and it should take care of itself.", "It sounds deserved, but would it help the situation at all? They say blood is thicker than water, but I don\u2019t believe it. Enjoy the new family you 2 are creating and let the loose ends go. Sounds like you\u2019d both be happier without them. Take the high road and don\u2019t BTA. But keep this in your pocket.", "Yes, YWBTA.  They don't have to attend and it's not your side of the family.  Your wife would likely not appreciate you charging in here.", "Will you cause more drama in doing so? Yes. Will your wife be unhappy about that? Only you know the answer.\n\nNTA. But, its unlikely this will end well, so remember that part.", "NTA,\n\nNo point calling them out just cut ties and leave it at that. I understand the need and want to call them out well but it just ain't worth the time and stress.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Either your wife is estranged or they just don't care,  either way it is your wife's family, she should be the one to address it if really desired.
