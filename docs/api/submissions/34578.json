Then you noted you spent 300 bucks on daughter, but after the backtracking, the believability of that drops.\n\nYou got daughter clothes, books, and perfume, which unless she actually asked for those things, sounds like there might be some form of sexism going on (i.e. videogames for boys, perfume for girls).\n\nYou are more than aware that your daughter shows a keen interest in gaming from the amount of time she silently sits beside her brother, watching him game, and you didn't like, even consider getting her some sort of console? If you really had a 300 dollar budget for her, you could have gotten her the Nintendo Switch Mini. \n\nAnd why are you calling her jealous and greedy after all of this? Shes a FOURTEEN year old that is REACTING to the way you are treating her. You're still her parent, any jealousy or greed she's had has likely been instilled into her by your parenting behaviors. \n\nNot to mention, over all of this, your son also has a PC? What the heck does your daughter have? Clothes and perfumes? Does she even use the perfumes? Are you trying to groom her to be what you envision a 14 year old girl to be, or are you actually listening to your daughter when she's expressing herself? I'm inclined to believe that you're not hearing her given that you've not once mentioned what she actually asked for. \n\nYTA", "yta if you can\u2019t afford 2 ps5s and your daughter likes gaming why didn\u2019t you get Xbox series s\u2019s lmao 2 of them cost around the same as one ps5 it kinda seems like your ignoring your daughters feelings and brushing it off as \u201cselfish\u201d if anything your 17 year old son should be more willing to share as he can just get a job and buy his own you know to show maturity, you need to sit down and actually talk with your kids because this is not it, in my house hold if the oldest got a gift they would share it with the youngest and buy their own, it\u2019s how the ps2 was shared until my brother got his own, you def need to step off of Reddit and read a parenting book or something because that sounds like a bad sibling dynamic", "I really hope this was written by the son lol because surely you can't be so tone deaf.

If you can't see how that is completely unfair, you need more than just your eyes checked. If you could afford the $500+ for one child, you better darn well spend an equal amount on the other!

This said, you kind of should have expected it. We are 4 siblings in my family and consoles and PCs have always been given as family gifts, and we'd take turns or play together, which also teaches boundaries but also teamplay. This is a good moment to teach her but also to suggest your son that rules don't have to be so strict and that generosity is nice. When he's done playing or is out of the house, why is he not willing to borrow it to her sister?\n\nIf you want to enforce this separate gifting philosophy, that's fine, but you need to be careful about giving your daughter something similar/she loves as much, and make sure you don't fall in gender traps if she likes similar things to her brother because it will enhance her frustration. So you can explain it's his PS5 as much as her xx is hers and she doesn't have to share it with him. If she wants to use his PS5, she borrows him her XX.

Meanwhile, women that I know in my life who are games tell me over and over again their stories of wanting to play games but that men ostracize them as soon they get into the space, they're berated as soon as men in games hear their voices if they have mics, or if they have female avatars they just get bombarded by sexualized messages. A lot of women have dealt with this by either masking their gendered online presence by just turning off their mics or using avatars that aren't women, or they go the route of \"being one of the boys\" of trying to take space and sometimes, unfortunately, belittling other women to be \"one of the boys\", as one friend myself put it herself.\n\nAnd yeah, the very thing you're doing is kind of reinforcing that thing that I've seen dozen of examples of. I also used to work in schools and the way that even adults snuff out or question girls' interest in games is so disheartening, while for boys it's just seen as \"part of who they are\". I applaud the girls and women who overcome this inane societal pressure to avoid games, but I despise that the culture that tries to remove or shame girls from engaging the wonderful world of what I think gaming could be. And yes, women are more represented in the mobile gaming market, which first of all I don't really see an issue with, but it also does go hand in hand with girls not really given the opportunity to have consoles by themselves.\n\nThe PS5 is an insanely expensive and powerful device. If you have two kids and your daughter has expressed an interest in it, why not let her engage? If by all means it is what you said that she \"only wants what she can't have because she's greedy\", she'll get bored within a week (I also think it's odd that we don't really question boys' tendency to get bored of 'boyish interests' quickly). If not, both of your kids now have access to an extremely poweful device where both can surely find the kind of game that suits them, and could spark an equal interest for them to maybe pursue something in the field of tech.", "YTA \nYOU KNOW WHY \nThis is going impact your daughter's future behaviour and your relationship so better be careful now", "I see a child going no contact with you in the future and it's not your son.

They put the cake there and left, and when I tried to ask them to spend some time with me, they said \"we bought you the cake\". I grew up resenting them so much. Abusive parents always give excuses and blame their children for anything. For fuck's sake, your daughter is 14, why do you tell strangers she is very greedy?

I worked at Target in electronics for extra cash for a few years while the switch was never in the shelves and then well after. This was a fairly affluent area so I saw a lot of people buying each kid equitable amounts of gifts, so to each their own. \n\nPart of the job was asking questions about how the system was being used. If it was handheld, I was pretty understanding if they had the cash but it was the ones who kept them docked that always had some perplexing answer. Docked when the boy is playing but he takes it to his room so his sister doesn\u2019t play and beat his records. The sister was going to get the lite so she can play in the living room instead of watching her brother play. Parents bought it as a joint birthday gift because they thought the kids (i discovered at this point that they were fraternal twins, because I\u2019m now invested) would share but the brother took it for himself and instead of trying to see if he would share he was getting the girl the lite version. She was the one who asked for the switch to dock using the TV when the brother wanted a PS4 and had a flat screen in his room. I\u2019m already positive this dude was a jackass and we were slow so I kept going. They would not use Nintendo online and pretty exclusively get played mariokart or smash bros, or splatoon 2. When he found out the brother would have the primary console and would have to repurchase games digitally or let the sister use the primary console, he said she might just have to save up to get the games because it was ridiculous buying it twice (I didn\u2019t disagree but I could think of a few solutions that involved telling his son to suck it up). \n\nAt this point I\u2019m not asking questions to try to help him decide on what to get but I want to know more because I feel like the purchase has been proven to be not well thought out. He then added that they got the full one because she tends to drop things so it made more sense for hers to get docked and stay there. And yet here we were. I asked if he wanted a case for it since it would be handheld and those are harder to insure and he declined the case and insurance. \n\nA week later he tried to return it very clearly smashed and it didn\u2019t go well. I asked if she dropped it and she said the brother smashed it because she wouldn\u2019t let him borrow the lite (???) for the day so he could bring it to school (???? couldn\u2019t bring the regular switch?) and then smashed the regular switch when the dad said they would now have to share (no real punishment). I\u2019m wondering now if daughter actually drops things or if they have a golden boy who smashes any nice thing she has that he can\u2019t have even if he has the more valuable thing. \n\nat the end of the conversation he bought a PS4 for the son because that was what he wanted to begin with and the possessiveness must have been due to that. Before he left he said the sister can get her switch for Christmas (it was APRIL) if she had learned to share by then, but she wasn\u2019t getting the car he had planned on getting each of them for their next birthday. I thought the entire time they had to be ten or under but nope. That was the worst and illogical exchange I ever had over a switch and I hope the daughter had gone NC by now, but the parents buying two or three PS4s because their kids \u201cwouldn\u2019t\u201d share were extremely common too.

They told me nothing is wrong with you. You just need to practice on focusing more and you\u2019re a teenager. Teenagers are never happy and you\u2019re anxious every morning bec you don\u2019t like going to school. Luckily I was still able to graduate with my 1995 class.

I could finally breathe and actually had a smile on my face for the first time after many years. He wrote me out prescriptions for all three I was diagnosed with. As soon as my session was done I called my parents and told them, remember me telling y\u2019all how I felt and I thought something was wrong with me back in high school? They responded back by saying yes. I said, good glad y\u2019all remember that. I say that, bec I have just been prescribed anxiety, depression and adhd meds. Just think if you two would have taken me seriously when I was 14, I would have graduated high somewhere between the top or middle half of my class. Since yall didn\u2019t listen to me I didn\u2019t graduate at the top or middle. Instead my ranking was dead last. They apologized profusely and said that they should have listened to me.

But it created a pattern of him being the one to ask for the newest stuff.\n\nLooking back, we were never taught to share. We each had our own Gameboy, eventually our own PCs, and only I was interested in dad's clunky PS1. Our first truly shared console was the GameCube. It was a hand me down, so mom was able to afford also getting a PS2 for Christmas. I don't remember if it was \"for\" anyone specifically, but I gravitated towards the GameCube while he played a bit of both but more PS2. So there was this notion of \"the Playstation is his but the Nintendo is ours\".\n\nThings started to get worse with the Gameboy SP. I had no idea it had come out, but my brother got one right away. The backlit screen was a complete game changer compared to my wormlight, but when my parents figured out that this \"new system\" wasn't actually required to play any new games like every other upgrade, they refused to get me one, even though I played handheld way more than he did. My brother ate up my jealousy.\n\nThen he got the Xbox 360. This was the first console that was 100% his. Mom didn't like how loud he and his friends got playing Halo or COD, so she converted her barely used office into his **personal** gaming room. His 360 was kept in there, while we got a Wii for the family room. I eventually got to move the PS2 and GameCube to my bedroom, but I was the only one who enjoyed replaying the same old games while he kept getting new stuff. At first, he let me play Viva Pinata on the 360, but soon he hated the idea of me even being in \"his\" space. Sometimes I would be \"allowed\" to watch him play GTA or Bully, but I was too annoying so eventually he stopped letting me watch. I had to sneak in there if I wanted to play either myself. It felt like karma every time that thing got the red ring of death.\n\nWhat really ticked me off was when he got a PS3. I didn't like most of the games for Xbox anyway so I didn't complain too much, but the PS3 was an *amazing* console with tons of exclusives I wanted, kept in the family room because mom had just gotten a newer, nicer TV in there, and yet still I wasn't allowed to play.

BEFORE 3 she still \"shared\" with me via me watching beside her and holding an unplugged controller \"helping\" her. I started being able to properly play sonic and bubsy alone by time I was 4 without her constant help.

Hope she goes NC and builds a beautiful life without them", "Honestly, it sounds more like it was written by the son who is annoyed at listening to his sister want to play the PS5 and is justifying her as greedy because she supposedly got \"gifts\" too.

It's a family thing.", "I was very into gaming (playing and programming) at an early age. And as much as my mom favored my brother, they bought a family Sega as a way for us to bond. I get that that is not how things are now, but as they couldn't afford two, the one they did buy should have been a family gift.\n\nOur cats will never not know gaming as well. ;)", "Yes.

I live in a low level hoarder house, and I'm afraid to go outside.", "I'm 47 and didn't start treating my ADHD until the last decade or so, and my quality of life has improved leaps and bounds. To the degree that one day I had an absolute crying breakdown because I could have been living like this my whole life, if anyone had noticed and done something. Take that example however you'd like, it's just my experience. \n\nAnother experience I share is having kids with ADHD. One presented enough symptomology to get a diagnosis before starting school. The other didn't, but seemed to definitely have some things going on. We live in a school district with tons of resources, so when the teachers said he was doing well enough and not to worry about treatment, I listened. I shouldn't have! \n\nNow he is an adult and it turns out he has ADHD *and* dyslexia. But it's very difficult to find offices that evaluate adults, and it took over a year and a half to get him an appointment. \n\nSo one thing that I would say is, if your gut is telling you your child might be diagnosable, listen to your gut even if the teachers tell you they're fine. The worst that happens is you spend some time at some appointments and are told your kid is fine.", "I struggled really badly through my undergrad.

(And some of the complications even became interesting memories if I'm being honest. It wasn't anything terrible, and our dad had us sort it out between ourselves as much as possible with a list of ground rules for guidance.

It really helps with focus and not wandering off task for a lot of ADHD people, myself included.  \n\n\nMaking yourself take frequent breaks and splitting tasks up via a to-do list. It helps with not getting overwhelmed and avoiding the 'hyperfocusing on a task until I burn out' pitfall.\n\nThere's more but brain be tired so I can't think of any atm. Hopefully those two help, though.

Totally feel your pain", "Exactly. Like when did buying a game console end up being just for one kid? \n\nWhen my parents got us video game consoles, they were \"family consoles\" and maybe a few peripherals would be gifted to one kid specifically. Like a limited edition controller or something. \n\nI remember one time where I got a game that only I wanted, so it was given to me specifically. I still let my brothers play it whenever they wanted, they just couldn't take the cartridge/disc to their friends house or anything."]}
