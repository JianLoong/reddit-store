{"id": 1536, "submission_id": "ymsl6p", "title": "AITA for making my bf pay for expensive bath products even though he can\u2019t afford them?", "selftext": "I (24F) and have been dating my bf (29M) for a year and half and have been living together for 6 months. \n\nI have a well paying job but my bf is looking for a phd position so is working part-time delivering medicines and volunteering at the university. When we moved in together we agreed to put 50% of our salaries into a joint account for joint expenses like rent and groceries and the rest 50% into our personal accounts. Since I make thrice as much as him I have more \u2018fun money\u2019 but it also means I\u2019m contributing a lot more to our joint account. \n\nOne thing I like to treat myself with is body bath products from this really expensive brand. I pay for them using my personal account and buy less expensive products for my boyfriend using our joint account. Recently, I started smelling these products on my bf (they have a strong distinct smell) so I asked him if he used them. He said he only uses them a few times a month so I let it go as that\u2019s fine. However I started smelling them on him all the time and also realised I\u2019m running out way quicker than usual. So I confronted him and he admitted that he prefers my products over his so he uses them daily. I said no problem but I\u2019ll be paying from them using our joint account from now on. Well, he freaked out. He said he can\u2019t afford them and since I have more money in my personal account anyways I can afford it. I however think it\u2019s unfair as I\u2019m already paying so much towards our joint account that I would like to use my personal money for my own things and savings. Also, it\u2019s not like I asked him to contribute more than he does towards the joint account, we can afford these products together after our other expenses. It will just cut through a bit from our joint savings. \n\nWe got into a huge fight and he\u2019s saying that I\u2019m financially abusing him. He got our friends involved and they\u2019re split. They think I should be considerate of his feelings as I make a lot more than him and can easily afford the products on my own. Now he has stopped using the products as protest and I feel terrible.\n\nETA: Since the comments are mixed, I want to give a bit more information. \n1. My boyfriend is looking for his phd in a field with very limited opportunities (like archeology) whereas I work in a very high demand field (think AI). So we always knew I would be making more money than him and we agreed that there will be some things that I can afford while he can\u2019t. So I make a point to get him nice gifts and take him out for expensive dinners every once in a while. \n2. They aren\u2019t just any bath products. I use Dr Barbara Strum or Molten Brown products. They can be very expensive. \n3. My job is very demanding so I unwind by taking baths so it\u2019s something important to me. I snapped when he used one of my favourite bath bombs that\u2019s hard to find and is expensive. \n4. We also equally divide household chores so it\u2019s not like I bring in more money so I can relax more at home.", "created_utc": 1667651355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymsl6p/aita_for_making_my_bf_pay_for_expensive_bath/", "score": 1093, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's the one who started just using your products every day without asking after saying he only used them rarely, and he's the one who decided by himself without telling you that you should be 100% subsidizing his use of your personal luxury items.\n\nHe doesn't need these things. They are a personal indulgence, which is why they weren't part of the shared household budget and you paid for them out of your personal money. If he wants to indulge he should at the very least ask; and if he wants to make luxury products his every day experience then he can pay for them. It's not like the alternative is scrubbing himself with thistles picked from the side of the road. He just doesn't get to smell extra nice every day for free.\n\n*edited to fix brain fart.", "NTA. You use the joint account for things you both use. If he wants equal access to the products, he should contribute some to it. Especially since you said you can afford it from the joint account. And you were okay with it when it was a few times a month. You've been super tolerant.", "NTA but I really don't think his issue starts and stops at toiletries... If he's upset enough to cry financial abuse (which this is decidedly *not*, btw), there's something more going on.\n\nIs it possible he resents you making more than him? It may be a good idea to have another talk about finances, because if this imbalance is going to keep causing issues you need to find a solution before it festers.", "NTA\n\nPlus I feel that most of the ESH and YTA commenters are reading it wrong.\n\nYou're not \"charging him for bath products.\"\n\nYou're just saying that since the bath products are a *joint expense* (since both of you are using them, not just you), the cost should come out of the *shared account*\u2014to which you're already contributing more than he is (sounds like around 75/25). \n\nThat's absolutely fine!", "NTA. Next, he is gonna be taking your car because it\u2019s nicer? Or your phone? If you choose to financially support him while he pursues his phd, it should be on your terms. If he thinks that\u2019s beneath him, he can find a new sugar mamma. Choosing higher education often comes with low income for a while, so he should be prepared to live the low-income life that comes with it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s an investment.", "NTA. In those 6 months you have been living together, you are building your very well necessary ground rules for coexistence. Couples need their personal space and things too. But your BF is using your stuff, liying about how much he uses it, and doesn't want to fairly pay for it. I don't think that is a good sign in financial and personal aspects.", "NTA. The fact that he doesn\u2019t think he should have to pay even a fraction of the cost of the stuff he uses is a huge issue. Claiming you\u2019re financially abusing him while you foot the majority of the bills is completely unreasonable and he is a mooch. If/when he starts earning a comparable salary, he will probably continue to be the selfish and greedy person he has revealed himself to be.", "Technically if you're putting more in the joint account would that not mean you're paying for majority of these products? Technically now\n\nBut on the serious note, if he wants to use them then obviously he's got to pay for them so NTA\n\nYou reap the seeds you sow as they say", "NTA. Household products come from the joint account. I don\u2019t understand what the issue is.", "NTA \n\nA couple of things:\nI think it would be a very good idea for you and your boyfriend to sit down and try to have a conversation about this without it escalating, and I think you really should talk about what he meant when he said that you\u2019re financially abusing him.\nBecause you\u2019re not! I see it more and more that people are throwing around words like that without the true meaning behind it, and I don\u2019t understand why he thinks that.\nYou\u2019re in fact paying for two thirds of his products and for all of your products so I don\u2019t understand how he could come to the conclusion that you\u2019re financially abusing him.\n\nI don\u2019t know you guys or your relationship, but it sounds like there might be underlying issues, maybe he feels resentful because you earn more and are able to spend more, and knows this will go on until he has his Phd? Maybe you feel resentful because you contribute more to the household expenses? I don\u2019t want answers obviously, but I think it would be a good idea for both of you to sit down and talk about your finances again and just tell the other person how you feel", "NTA. If they are products used by both, the household account should take care of it. Shouldn't be a problem since you can enjoy the products together. I don't think he knows what financial abuse is.", "NTA. If he can use them, he can cough up some money for them, aka from the joint account", "NTA, you're not obligated to help your BF live beyond his means. You both contribute to your household expenses and these products are outside of that category. Either he pays up or stops using them.", "NTA. He turned the good bath stuff into a joint expense by using them all the time. The household budget just went up, so you both contribute more. No reason to fuss unless he's an entitled brat. You already contribute 75% of the household expenses to support him in his pursuit of higher education. Not paying more when he unilaterally increases the household expenses is taking advantage of you, regardless of why. He has to decide which he wants more, the products or his fun money.", "NTA. Molton Brown is expensive AF.", "NTA.  Things that both of you use should be paid from the joint account.  You are already paying 3X more than he is into the joint account and he wants more?  Who is abusing who here?", "NTA Lol not paying for luxury items is not financial abuse... WTH", "NTA, it\u2019s only fair that you both pay for the products if he\u2019s going to use half. It was not tit for tat, you didn\u2019t mind him using SOME but it\u2019s another thing if he wants to use them all the time. Also as another user pointed out, if you\u2019re putting half of your salary into the account you\u2019re already paying more, how is this abuse?", "NTA. He\u2019s not being financially abused. If anything, he\u2019s using you since you\u2019re pretty much subsidizing his living expenses. He\u2019s being beyond unreasonable here.", "NTA. If he wants to use them jointly then they become a joint expense, it is not very difficult for him to obtain his own toiletries and hygienic products If replacing yours isn't in the budget", "NTA if he wanna use the more expensive stuff he could have asked when he knew they were more expensive \n\nMigth get his phd position (idk know what it is exactly not from the us) so he can ask if he can pay you back not just expect you to pay for it alone for 2 people", "NTA \n\nIt was agreed upon that finances would be split and both would add in 50% for joint expenses.

The joint account is for joint expenses. He turned them into a joint expense when he started using them every day.", "NTA and cut the dead weight, he sounds exhausting to live with. Why do this to yourself when you're a perfectly capable woman?", "NTA but one indicator of abuse, in this case manipulation couples with the silent treatment, is someone doing something unreasonable and accusing you of being the abuser. Read up on DARVO and take a step back and really think about your relationship and whether or not there are similar instances of this kind of behavior.", "NTA - the two of you really need a serious discussion if he\u2019s pulling out the financial abuse card.\n\nIf your able to afford them, treat yourself all you want.\nBoyfriend is literally stealing your products and is now calling foul for you wanting it to come from joint money and not your separate account.\n\nThis will be coming up more and more in the future.  You can afford it, so you need to pay for it.\n\nUnless you want to start being treated as an ATM, you need to nip this now.\n\nIs he really looking for a position or is he going to pull that I can\u2019t find anything that\u2019s worthy so you can just pay for everything while he plays.", "NTA\n\nMy husband and I do share some products \u2026like I absolutely know when he\u2019s using my stuff. The better point is that he also buys some of it or keeps our shared stuff stocked. Your bf wants to use your luxury products simply because they are already there.\n\n\nHowever. \n\nBarbara Sturm is *goooood* shit. I\u2019d be fucking appalled at my husband for using that. It\u2019s cute he thinks he can hijack your products and understand what he\u2019s doing. I bet he\u2019s wearing actives outside without sunblock. That\u2019ll catch up to him.", "NTA. If he can't afford to repay you, he shouldn't be touching them. He's using YOUR expensive product after you've already designated some for him. \n\nTell him when he starts making more money he can buy his own.", "Nta.  If he is using them all the time then buy from joint account.  You are contributing more to the joint account anyway.", "NTA because you don't want to pay for your boyfriend to use expensive products, and you shouldn't have to if you don't want to. And did he really call it financial abuse? Like, seriously? That's ridiculous.\n\nAlso, \"he has stopped using the products as protest\". That's just LOL. It's literally what you wanted so how is it a protest? Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. He didn't think that one through.\n\nHowever, you do sound a bit transactional about your relationship, and like you have maybe built up some resentment about the financial split. I don't think you are as ok with the current set-up as you claim to be. As you are not married and are co-mingling finances to a certain extent, you might want to get to the bottom of this issue.", "I think you should just drop the joint account and just have your personal ones. You can still split rent, bills etc with personal accounts, if he wants bath products then he should just buy his own, or atleast contribute a percentage of his money to the bath products you buy so you're sharing the product and the price. NTA", "I think if he is going to be this petty I n this think is this really the mad you want to be with.\n\nNta", "NTA If he wants to use specific products he cam buy them himself. Personal care items are not part of shared expenses", "NTA. You need to reconsider your whole financial setup and whether or not you want to keep financially supporting a man 5 years your senior who doesn\u2019t want to pay a fair share of shared household products.", "This sub is filled with older men dating women in their early 20s and financially mooching off them in indefensible ways. You're like the 5th post I've seen in a month. You are NTA but the financial abuse is flowing the other way. He is deliberately raising your expenses to cut into your independence from him. You don't say what kind of PhD he's getting but will he even eventually make enough money to balance this out, and how long will you have to put up with this inequity before that happens?  \n\nA previous poster with a bf just like yours actually put a lockbox under the sink and hid her products in there.  The other posters, whose boyfriends were usually spending their money by inviting all their friends out for free meals and then forgetting their wallets at home, forcing the younger women to pay for all the food, all got their asses dumped. \n\nYou could stop buying expensive products for a while, or keep them at work and apply them when you get to the office.

He\u2019s trying to take advantage of you. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my little lady for 8 years, lived together the last 5, and personally, I think y\u2019all are doing the joint account wrong. Both people should contribute equal amounts, not equal percentages. \n\nIf he only puts in $50, then you should only put in $50. His money is not worth more than yours because he has less of it. That\u2019s not how society works. \n\nAs for the shampoo, if you paid for it with personal funds and asked him not to use it, he ought to be an adult about it and stop using products he can\u2019t afford, especially since he refuses to pay half for it. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t matter if he will be a doctor. If he is bad with money now, he will be bad with money then.", "NAH\n\n\nThis isn't really about bath products,  it's about money and who has more.

Period.\n\nI understand his frustration and envy, trust me. I was raised, not wealthy but certainly upper middle class, with access to lots of nice things, and I am now amongst the poorest economic class in my country thanks to having become severely disabled and living on meagre disability benefits. It was an incredibly difficult lesson to learn, having to live within very different means and give up almost any and all nice things. Suddenly \"luxuries\" were not Jo Malone perfumes but being able to buy myself some nicer food from the grocery store, LOL. But that is reality, and that's what your boyfriend needs to learn: that we would ALL - every one of us - love to have luxurious things, but at some points in our lives some of us cannot afford them. \n\nAnd sometimes we live with people who can, and far from being \"financially abused\", I'd say he is incredibly lucky to have a partner who is loving and generous enough to say, \"Hey, I'm okay if you want to treat yourself OCCASIONALLY with my nice things.\" And that you buy him nice things on special occasions. But he is your boyfriend, not your life partner, and your finances are not commingled, and he is not ENTITLED to the luxuries that you buy to treat yourself.

Even though I was technically working full-time, I was still able to make time to look for jobs I was eligible for and apply for them. I also did other things to save money or earn extra money, like participate in focus groups for cash and get my hair cut for free by hairstylists in training.

It\u2019s a slippery slope when someone starts justifying why they shouldn\u2019t have to pay their share especially when it involves living beyond their means.

Currently, the joint account is paying for his bath products. If you\u2019re getting the cheapest possible without being useless, you\u2019re likely spending $5 on an item like body wash. That means with him putting in 25% of the overall budget, he\u2019s \u201cpaying\u201d $1.25 for that bottle. \n\nNow, you referenced a couple of brands. Milton Brown\u2019s body washes are around $35. For a bottle like that, he\u2019d be \u201cpaying\u201d $8.75. If that kind of amount breaks the bank for him, then he needs to find a better job immediately, without seeking his dream job. \n\nI doubt that you\u2019re having to buy every item each month, so these products are likely something like $50-75 of the overall budget. That\u2019s not financial abuse and if he likes the products, then why pitch a fight? Since it\u2019s so low stakes, I\u2019d consider this a big issue that he\u2019s throwing such a hard fit. Consider it a big red flag for future finances. \n\nI would keep the stuff that you buy specifically for you in your budget but also express to him that this basket/cupboard/stocking from Christmas is for you and you alone because they\u2019re treats for you and you will be expecting him to ask about using them before using them and to replace things he uses. He\u2019s welcome to make his own little collection of stuff and you\u2019d be happy to help him find things he likes based on the stuff you like. Maybe he decides to go with a different brand that\u2019s cheaper, and you can help him out with that so that he finds similar things. \n\nBut I think the biggest thing would be to write down what gets bought when (if you share them from now on) and show him how much it really is each month and how much of \u201chis\u201d money would go to it.
