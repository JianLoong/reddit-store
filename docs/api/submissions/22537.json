Anyway someone made the comment that he could be my kid and he ran with it. So for over a month I have been dealing with him calling me \"father\", \"daddy\" and other names.

My boss has even gotten into calling me his dad, though not very often. It is driving me crazy.\n\n\nNow to the part where I may be the AH. If he wants me to be his \"daddy\" I will be. One morning before the daily safety meeting he started up with his bullshit and so I finally publicly accepted that he was in face my son. Then described how he came about, in front of everybody. I explained how I had too many beers one night and went to taco bell.

No mother carried him. No mother cared for him. The existence he has came from only me, beer, and a culinary mistake. \n\n\nNow everyone is calling him taco bell, or as I said earlier the Buthole Messiah. He asked me to stop and I told him I couldn't deny my child anymore. He doesn't talk to me much anymore, but I really don't care. My boss asked me to stop this, as if I could at this point. I asked him where he was the whole time I protested, he didn't say anything. \n\n\nAnyway,  I await your judgment, am I the AH for bringing the Buthole Messiah into this world?", "created_utc": 1689652792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152nlmq/aitah_for_explaining_how_my_son_came_into_being/", "score": 631, "replies": ["NTA\n\nThis is amazing.
