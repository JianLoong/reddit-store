I understand the thrust of her joke, as I also have a \u201cweird\u201d sense of humor, but your grandmother is the asshole. It\u2019s not because she made the joke, but because she stands by it after it caused upset, and apparently plans to keep it up. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a weird sense of humor- hell, there\u2019s not even really anything weird about it given how many people have one- but that doesn\u2019t mean everybody else should have to be exposed to it if it\u2019s hurtful for them. And in that we find your grandmother\u2019s fault: ribbing isn\u2019t good for people who are hurt by it.\n\nWithout passing judgment on your dad (as nobody should stay in a failed marriage once it has jumped the shark), five kids from two ex-wives is a rather formidable track record for any prospective partner. Your dad\u2019s wife likely had to overcome some degree of fear or at least misgiving before deciding to marry him, and it was likely an intense bit of soul searching. Some people cope with fear by deriving humor from potential tragedy, and others don\u2019t. There needs to be space in the world for both of those types of people, and for those us with the former proclivity, that means recognizing when people of the latter proclivity aren\u2019t into it and respecting their boundaries. Apologize to your dad\u2019s wife, and perhaps even talk to your grandmother about letting this go because it\u2019s obviously a sensitive subject.", "I hope you won't mind your dad looking for a 4th wife after this little stunt", "NTA. It was a harmless joke. She probably took it as your family seeing her as disposable when you were really just making fun of your dad. I would\u2019ve been slightly offended that it was a \u201cwhen\u201d and not an \u201cif\u201d but not enough to leave the room.", "NTA. She's insecure. It was just a joke.", "She was offended, so if you care about her you would apologize because that wasn't your intent.\n\nIf your intent WAS to offend her, and you just wanted to be mean, then yeah YTA\n\nJust because it's funny between you and grandma doesn't mean it's funny to other people involved.", "YTA, and your grandmother. A joke is only funny if the butt of the joke also finds it funny. You both persisted after it became clear that she didn\u2019t like it.", "Ima go out on a limb here and say that compliments referencing one\u2019s impending single motherhood aren\u2019t all that likely to land. There are other ways to tell your DIL that you like her better than your son without joking about something she\u2019s probably lost sleep over already.", "NTA the next wife might find it funny.", "Nta. You and your grandma are hilarious and probably got that woman on the path she needs for when it happens to her.", "NTA I don't think you had any bad intentions, but I'm wondering if you struck a nerve of insecurity - how could she not worry a bit that he'll ditch her with young kids too, he's done it twice before?\n\nIf you feel bad about it and have a good relationship with her, you could always say \"I'm sorry if that made you uncomfortable, grandma and I joke like that but we didn't mean to make you feel upset.\"", "NTA  Is your dad's wife pregnant now or is she trying? This could account for her reaction, worried that she might have a girl.", "She is the mother of this man\u2019s third set of children, so she is well aware of what his previous families look like. She can\u2019t be mad at people for pointing out his pattern, although I do not think it was a great taste.\n\nNTA - She seems to be pretty upset at the truth? It can be a horrible thing to say, but it can also be factual. Both can be true.", "NTA If she's not aware of your father's track record she lives in a hole. She could have responded with something along the lines of our with the old and in with the new or well everyone deserves an upgrade. Bottom line is this could have been all out hostility so tbh just move on.", "NTA. You and your Grandma have good insight and a wonderful inside joke about your father's serial monogamy. Never lose the humor,life gets bleak sometimes without it. Also,I bet the joke is really closer to the mark that you both realize. Long life to your grandma-she sounds like a really fun lady.", "NTA.\n\nI expected a vulgar joke including juicy sex details, lol...\n\nThese are actually brilliant (brutally honest, but brilliant). Your grandma sounds like a fun lady.\n\nIf she hasn't caught up on your Dad leaving two wife's after getting them both pregnant more than once... than that's her problem.\n\nObviously you could decide to apologise that you made her uncomfortable (not necessarily for what you said) if it makes you feel better and you like her otherwise.", "Yeah, a little YTA. The jokes were funny and no harm was intended and it was all aimed at your father. \n\nAt some point, you have to be able to joke about a guy like your father - otherwise, you would scream at him and ask her why she married and had kids w/ a guy w/ that kind of history.\n\nOn the other hand, she has to be uncomfortable about his past and probably doesn't have the distance you and your grandma have to \"appreciate\" the humor. The \"My Son/Dad, am I right?\" jokes were likely making light of a huge fear that also, let's be honest, has a high probability of happening. Unfortunately, you also don't know what is happening in their relationship right now either.\n\nYeah, she went into the relationship w/ eyes open, but she has a kid now, is getting older and the marriage hasn't been in the honeymoon phase or quite awhile, so she HAS to be worried in some part of her brain that he is getting ready to move on to a newer model.  Making lite of his awful behavior tword his wives is probably not a joke she can see the humor in at this stage of the relationship.\n\nOnce you saw she was uncomfortable, you should have stopped.", "Obviously YTA the jokes are pretty funny but do you really have to ask why the woman wont find the prospect of her divorce funny? Read the room", "Your grandmother made a joke that didn't land and made her uncomfortable. That's not what you did, despite your title.\n\nYou doubled down on the joke *after* it had made her uncomfortable. Then your grandmother went back in for another barb.\n\nHer initial joke could be innocent, but the doubling down makes you and grandma YTA.", "YTA. Jokes are meant to be funny. What the heck is funny about what you said? You sound like a 5 year old.", "Yeah, YTA. You and grandma both. When she was noticeably uncomfortable,  you doubled down instead of backing down. \n\nJokes are only funny when the person you're joking about is laughing too", "ESH I guess but this is so low stakes. You guys saw she was uncomfortable with the first joke and decided to keep making similar ones. I find the jokes inoffensive but I'm not in the position your stepmom is. This is *not* a huge issue. Just apologize and move on.", "YTA for keeping it going when she clearly wasn't comfortable with the subject", "You became the asshole when you noticed her discomfort and kept going - keep the cruel jokes between you and granny next time or better yet, just stop commenting on other people's marriages. YTA", "YTA, of course.\n\nWhat's the joke?  Where's the part she was supposed to laugh at?  \"You married a mysogynist that will leave you the moment you produce an offspring of the wrong gender, haha, it's funny.  No, no, you don't get it, he's only with you because your a baby factory, har har har.\"", "Making a joke and someone being uncomfortable does not make you TA. What makes YTA is that you kept going despite that. The moment you were aware she didn't like the joke you should have let up, especially since it probably seemed like you were making the joke at her expense. Apologize for pushing it too far.", "YTA, after the first time it was obvious these weren't jokes to her so you and your grandma should have dropped it, instead you tripled down.", "Nta.", "YTA. That\u2019s a shitty and terrible joke. You also may have ruined his marriage.", "YTA.\n\nWhile I think these jokes are perfectly fine, and quite funny, your dad's wife clearly does not agree.\n\nJokes are a matter of audience. This audience was not right for that joke.\n\nWhere it verges into asshole territory, though, is when the wife expressed her distaste for that kind of joke, and then you and your grandma doubled down and kept saying them.\n\nAnd then when the wife removed herself from that situation, your grandma decided to make this her fault with that \"too sensitive\" line.", "NTA\n\nBut please come back and update us when your dad is onto wifey #4.", "NAH or ESH. This is a clash of expectations and conversational styles. Talk it through with her (and gesture toward an apology) once tempers have died down. I can say that that joke would have made me uncomfortable if I were in her position. And while, on close inspection, the target of the joke is your dad, who's more in-bounds for rough humor, it wouldn't feel that way to her. It would feel threatening. I do think it's on you to make amends, but I wouldn't call anyone here an AH.", "While not asshole territory, it certainly is in poor taste. \n\nDefinitely apologize to your stepmom for the foot-in-the-mouth moment.", "Not enough information.  It sounds like you really don't know your stepmother that well based on her reaction to your joke.  If that is so, it was probably a tasteless joke that shouldn't have been made.  It is best to apologize and let her know that you meant no ill will nor that her marriage was in danger.", "NTA.  You were not even joking about her, you were joking about your dad.  She is being offended over something that is not even about her.", "Your jokes were legit funny. NTA.", "NTA \n\nBut She really turned a blind eye to the red flags & still married your dad.", "NTA and your grandmother is hilarious.", "NAH something tells me that is current wife has already seen this pattern and it makes her feel insecure. You simply voiced those insecurities and let others know that they see what she sees. However, I can see how others talking about your marriage would be upsetting. It's not necessarily an asshole thing to point out patterns but she's not wrong for feeling offended by it either.", "You guys are hilarious, your grandmother sounds like a riot. NTA", "Both your remarks and those of your grandmother seem to indicate some resentment towards your father and his latest wife picked up on it. It doesn't make you (or your grandmother) a bad person. Just be aware of it.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have married a man with a pattern of knocking women up and leaving once he\u2019s a few kids deep. Must have one hell of a job though to afford child support.", "NAH\n\nYou spoke truth.  She was shocked and disturbed to see herself as part of a trend rather than as a new and different relationship with him.\n\nYour grandmother definitely pushed it a bit far though.  Since wife3 wasn't laughing she should have dropped it instead of trying to force a hard truth into a joke.", "Right? She married a man who had FIVE kids, and divorced their moms while the kids were toddlers TWICE. If you can't see the writing on that wall maybe don't marry Nick Cannon ffs", "I was legit wondering if OP is my half sibling\n\nOP your dads name Dan?", "If she hadn\u2019t picked up on that track record already then\u2026", "I don't think so, but I wouldn't necessarily be the first person to find out.", "He\u2019s probably working on it already.", "This.

All these people saying \u201cOmg the jokes were funny!\u201d have to be the least funny people on the planet.

If she knew this going in, she should not be surprised.\n\nBaby daddy is still a big asshole, though.", "OP's dad needs to step it up if he's going to catch Nick!", "Part of me wonders if she was somehow never told the timing of the earlier divorces and she had no idea that the youngest for each of the previous marriages were so young when he initiated proceedings. Especially if there's a decent gap between the first set and the second set, and the youngest sister is now 8+.\n\nThat would not be a nice way to get that bit of insight into someone you've already married and gotten involved with your kid. But that would 100% not be on OP or grandma, as they would have no reason to think this was a secret.", "Well, all you have to do is have a distance. Don't let everything get under your skin, because you gain nothing from it.\n\n\n\nI agree it could hurt her somehow, but I wouldn't say OP is AH either. Some people like dark humor, some like to joke about stuff like that. \n\n\n\nI will also mention that leaving like she did is not appropriate either. She is not 5 years old. She can also use words. \"I'm not comfortable with such jokes\". Also, she should work on her confidence.
