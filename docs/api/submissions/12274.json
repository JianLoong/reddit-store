She married a man who has zero issues leaving women with infants and starting again with someone else. It's going to be a joke at some point by the kiddos.", "NTA - You were just pointing a coincidence and cracked a little joke, no harm intended, specially at your father\u2019s wife, because she doesn\u2019t have daughters.\n\nYou followed you granny\u2019s joke and she even landed another one. \n\nApologize to your father\u2019s wife, she took the wrong way, but you are not an AH because of that.", "NTA. I think you made her paranoid now. Your jokes clearly showed that your dad has a track record in getting his wives pregnant then leaving them.", "NTA.\n\nTbh I expected worse jokes. She should stop being so sensitive for sure... joke about keeping her instead of your dad. How can this can make you uncomfortable when literally this joke is compliment.", "NTA if you apologize.\nYTA if you don't at least try to mend things with her.\n\nHumor is subjective and you obviously don't have a close enough relationship with her to joke about such things, yet.\n\nEdit: You saw her reaction, she didn't find it funny and are now asking strangers on the internet if it was OK to do that to her. Because you don't want to be person that hurt her. You did though, not really in am AH kind of way.\n\nFor making the joke, NTA. For not trying to mend things after obviously inflicting harm. YTA", "There may be something deeper that bothers her with your jokes. NTA for just making the joke but NGL I think it\u2019s mean if people keeping making jokes despite already knowing it makes someone uncomf (even worse if they say something along the lines of \u201ccan\u2019t you take a joke\u201d).", "You and your grandmother are TA for continuing to make these comments after it was clear that your dad\u2019s wife was uncomfortable. It\u2019s not a joke if it\u2019s hurting her feelings.\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to marry someone with a history of divorce, and yeah, she may be a little sensitive about that type of humor.

I understand the thrust of her joke, as I also have a \u201cweird\u201d sense of humor, but your grandmother is the asshole. It\u2019s not because she made the joke, but because she stands by it after it caused upset, and apparently plans to keep it up. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a weird sense of humor- hell, there\u2019s not even really anything weird about it given how many people have one- but that doesn\u2019t mean everybody else should have to be exposed to it if it\u2019s hurtful for them. And in that we find your grandmother\u2019s fault: ribbing isn\u2019t good for people who are hurt by it.\n\nWithout passing judgment on your dad (as nobody should stay in a failed marriage once it has jumped the shark), five kids from two ex-wives is a rather formidable track record for any prospective partner. Your dad\u2019s wife likely had to overcome some degree of fear or at least misgiving before deciding to marry him, and it was likely an intense bit of soul searching. Some people cope with fear by deriving humor from potential tragedy, and others don\u2019t. There needs to be space in the world for both of those types of people, and for those us with the former proclivity, that means recognizing when people of the latter proclivity aren\u2019t into it and respecting their boundaries. Apologize to your dad\u2019s wife, and perhaps even talk to your grandmother about letting this go because it\u2019s obviously a sensitive subject.", "I hope you won't mind your dad looking for a 4th wife after this little stunt", "NTA. It was a harmless joke. She probably took it as your family seeing her as disposable when you were really just making fun of your dad. I would\u2019ve been slightly offended that it was a \u201cwhen\u201d and not an \u201cif\u201d but not enough to leave the room.", "NTA. She's insecure. It was just a joke.", "She was offended, so if you care about her you would apologize because that wasn't your intent.\n\nIf your intent WAS to offend her, and you just wanted to be mean, then yeah YTA\n\nJust because it's funny between you and grandma doesn't mean it's funny to other people involved.", "YTA, and your grandmother. A joke is only funny if the butt of the joke also finds it funny. You both persisted after it became clear that she didn\u2019t like it.", "Ima go out on a limb here and say that compliments referencing one\u2019s impending single motherhood aren\u2019t all that likely to land. There are other ways to tell your DIL that you like her better than your son without joking about something she\u2019s probably lost sleep over already."]}
