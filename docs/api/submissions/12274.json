I understand the thrust of her joke, as I also have a \u201cweird\u201d sense of humor, but your grandmother is the asshole. It\u2019s not because she made the joke, but because she stands by it after it caused upset, and apparently plans to keep it up. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a weird sense of humor- hell, there\u2019s not even really anything weird about it given how many people have one- but that doesn\u2019t mean everybody else should have to be exposed to it if it\u2019s hurtful for them. And in that we find your grandmother\u2019s fault: ribbing isn\u2019t good for people who are hurt by it.\n\nWithout passing judgment on your dad (as nobody should stay in a failed marriage once it has jumped the shark), five kids from two ex-wives is a rather formidable track record for any prospective partner. Your dad\u2019s wife likely had to overcome some degree of fear or at least misgiving before deciding to marry him, and it was likely an intense bit of soul searching. Some people cope with fear by deriving humor from potential tragedy, and others don\u2019t. There needs to be space in the world for both of those types of people, and for those us with the former proclivity, that means recognizing when people of the latter proclivity aren\u2019t into it and respecting their boundaries.

Long life to your grandma-she sounds like a really fun lady.", "NTA.\n\nI expected a vulgar joke including juicy sex details, lol...\n\nThese are actually brilliant (brutally honest, but brilliant). Your grandma sounds like a fun lady.\n\nIf she hasn't caught up on your Dad leaving two wife's after getting them both pregnant more than once... than that's her problem.\n\nObviously you could decide to apologise that you made her uncomfortable (not necessarily for what you said) if it makes you feel better and you like her otherwise.", "Yeah, a little YTA. The jokes were funny and no harm was intended and it was all aimed at your father. \n\nAt some point, you have to be able to joke about a guy like your father - otherwise, you would scream at him and ask her why she married and had kids w/ a guy w/ that kind of history.\n\nOn the other hand, she has to be uncomfortable about his past and probably doesn't have the distance you and your grandma have to \"appreciate\" the humor. The \"My Son/Dad, am I right?\" jokes were likely making light of a huge fear that also, let's be honest, has a high probability of happening. Unfortunately, you also don't know what is happening in their relationship right now either.\n\nYeah, she went into the relationship w/ eyes open, but she has a kid now, is getting older and the marriage hasn't been in the honeymoon phase or quite awhile, so she HAS to be worried in some part of her brain that he is getting ready to move on to a newer model.  Making lite of his awful behavior tword his wives is probably not a joke she can see the humor in at this stage of the relationship.\n\nOnce you saw she was uncomfortable, you should have stopped.", "Obviously YTA the jokes are pretty funny but do you really have to ask why the woman wont find the prospect of her divorce funny?

But words really *aren't* the only method of communication.
