Along with getting better, it also comes with me getting back into baking. I loved to bake as a kid but couldn't for a long time as just looking at baked goods made me want to throw up. But I've now started baking again, a lot.\r  \n\r  \nThe thing is it's not uncommon for me to eat very little or none of what I bake. At first, I was worried it was annoying and wasteful but my family assured me that they don't mind and that having fresh brownies or cake or bread is nice to have.\r  \n\r  \nNow my sister is overweight, and so are our parents. We were raised with no portion control or anything, and if it wasn't for my ED, I would probably be overweight as well. Due to my sister\u2019s lack of impulse control, most things I bake will be gone in a day. Brownies and cakes will barely last until lunchtime. Despite this, I continued to bake as it's really helping me and my disgust towards food in general.\r  \n\r  \nThis all came to a head last week. My sister had a doctor's appointment and came back in tears, she was now classified as obese and her doctor had recommended she limit the food she eats. She came into the kitchen and saw some cake and bread I had cooling and flipped out on me. She said that this is all my fault, that im doing this on purpose so I can be \u201cthe skinny one\u201d and that I only bake unhealthy things (which isn't true, I do bake healthy things but it\u2019s still pastry and card heavy\u2026.bc it's baking) and don't eat any so she will eat more just so she gets fat.\r  \n\r  \nThis just isn't true, due to my baking our parents have stopped buying store-bought bread and snacks, which she would normally eat all of. Her weight has been going up for a while so I don't think any of this is my fault. But she is insistent that it is and when I point out that im not forcing her to eat two trays of brownies before 12 she broke down. My parents sent me to my room. And when I came down to get something for dinner, all the stuff I had baked that day was gone, it had been two hours and two loaves of bread and a 10\u2019 cake was gone.\r  \n\r  \nThis is kinda a what do I do and AITA?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1691157372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15i0s0q/aita_for_purposely_trying_to_make_my_sister_fat/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Work on your healthy food relationships by helping each other.", "Can you donate the baked goods perhaps?", "NTA. But I think your parents need to get y\u2019all into some sort of therapy, seems like there is some very unhealthy attitudes towards food in your households and they need to be addressed from a professional pov.", "NAH. I wonder if perhaps your sister is suffering from binge eating disorder. It\u2019s similar psychologically to an addiction. You have a right to pursue your hobbies, but I can imagine her frustration if she\u2019s trapped in a mental illness with some huge triggers in the house. Something you could do relatively quickly is buy a safe, even a cheap one. Your sister can be restricted from the baked goods if she feels that she needs to be. Long term, she needs therapy.", "People with active eating disorders often do this.  Bake and cook for others and not eat any. It's a control issue that can partner with anorexia or exercise bulimia. The sister sounds like she has binge eating disorder, which is very real and painful too. \nEveryone here needs help with their unhealthy relationship to food. \n\nPlease get help individually or as a family. Is anyone in therapy?", "NAH. It sounds like your sister also has some disordered eating habits. The coping mechanism you've found that helps you, makes her life a lot harder. I know first hand what it feels like to be unable to stop yourself from eating - it fucking sucks. It sounds like she probably needs professional help (from a dietician or therapist with understanding of EDs, not a regular physician who will call her obese and tell her to lose some weight with no support).\n\nThere may be a compromise to be found that accommodates BOTH of your mental and physical needs. You and your sister both need to come to this from a place of love and understanding to find a solution that works. \n\nMaybe you still bake what you want, but bring it to your bedroom to cool so it isn't sitting out in the kitchen unattended. Maybe you make plans to sell or donate the majority of what you bake, so it is off limits to family. Maybe you only bake when sister isn't home and put the food in an opaque container for storage. Maybe you start baking a lot of raisin bread if sister hates raisins. Maybe you start baking at a friend or grandparent's house instead of at home.\n\nThere's lots of options, SHE needs to work on self control but also figure out what triggers her to overeat (which you have no control over or fault in), but YOU should try to accommodate her triggers while still being able to bake.", "NTA, you're not purposely getting to do anything to her. \n\nIF you like to bake,  you like to bake.   She doesn't have to eat everything in front of her. \n\nHowever, it sounds like everyone in your family has EDs of some sort.   Perhaps you, as a family, can take some healthy eating classes and you can find more challenging recipes to encourage healthy eating.", "Im the asshole.. when I read ED.. the only condition that came to mind was Erectile Dysfunction... You mean bulimia or anorexia...", "My friend had an ED and she used to cook/bake elaborate meals and cakes all the time. She barely touched them herself. We were talking about it recently and she said it was a form of her testing her control and will-power. \n\nNow, maybe you genuinely enjoy baking. That's cool. Did you receive any support for your ED? Did you know binge eating is also an ED? If that were my sister and she was struggling with any addiction, I wouldn't be flaunting whatever she had a problem with in her face all the time. Maybe you could show her a bit of support. You're not eating it anyway so maybe take a break and give her the opportunity to try to better her eating habits without the temptation of baking smells wafting through the house.", "I am not giving a judgment, but I do not think you are the only one in the house with disordered eating. It sounds like your sister may be struggling with binge eating and honestly having large amounts of baked good readily available at all times is not good for her if that is the case.", "NTA \u2014 but compromise on this one. Bake and give it to friends. Sell it, but don\u2019t keep it in the house. Just stop feeding them. It\u2019s not on you to control them.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister is responsible for self-control. But by your own admission your entire family struggles with self-control/weight management, and you bake daily without eating any yourself, and specifically leaving it for your family to eat.\n\nYour sister shouldn't be blaming you, but at the same time it's like collecting beer bottles you don't drink when you live with alcoholics and asking them to drink it for you. You're definitely making the situation worse. \n\nI'm also concerned about the implications of recovering from an eating disorder and making food you will not consume. But I'm no expert, so I won't comment on that any further. I could ask however: why baking? Why is baking your hobby? And if this hobby cannot be substituted, could you immediately air out the kitchen and drop off the baked goods at a friend's house or at school?", "NTA. As you said, you are not forcing her to eat an entire tray of brownies. It's on her to just have 1 or 2. But maybe she is struggling with a binge ED. That being said is there something else you could do with your baked good instead? Give them to friends or co-workers? Or is there a food pantry in your community that you could donate them to? I don't feel like you should have to give up baking just because of your family's eating habits.", "NAH.  You like to bake, your sister and family probably shouldn't be eating baked goods.\n\nDonate the food to a shelter or food bank.", "NTA.

You're right, nobody's forcing her to eat, but maybe she doesn't want to be like this but can't help it (it's like telling someone with anorexia, you've got food available, nobody's forcing you to starve, and obviously it's more complicated than that.)\n\nI think it'd be a shame if you stopped baking, but clearly it's triggering for your sister and I'm sure you understand how difficult that can be, since you've had your own struggles with food.\n\nHave you considered baking healthier recipes, and smaller batches? That way, you're being considerate of your sister but you don't have to give up your hobby.", "Do you know that your sister may actually be suffering under an ED as well, just with a lack of impuls control and overeating?\n\nI would suggest you offer up your baking skills to somewhere outside your house, to help your family while still helping yourself", "NAH. It sounds like everybody in your family has an unhealthy relationship with food.\n\n- Your sister binge eating 2 trays of of brownies before noon is NOT normal behaviour and the fact that she is not being able to control herself is not either. I think your sister needs professional help with that, just like you did with your diagnosed eating disorder.\n- Two or three adults eating two loafs of bread and a cake within 2 hours is also not normal.\n\nBoth your parents did you and your sister a big disfavour by not addressing their own food related issues. You grew up with their unhealthy example. Now you AND your sister both experience the consequences of that, physically and mentally, each in their own way.", "NTA. I think your sister may have some sort of eating disorder as well. Perhaps you could donate some or all of the baked goods or possibly sell them? Maybe pack them in a storage container and only leave a few portion out ?", "1. NTA\n2. Cooking for other is a sign of some EDs\n3. It sounds like there is deeper control issue in the family dynamic that food is involved in if both children have an ED - agree that family therapy may be useful\n4. You are 19 and your parents are sending you to your room? (see 3) wtf", "The sister has no self control so OP is the one who has to give his stuff away? It's not his problem to manager her food issues as well as his own! That could easily just add more stress onto him about baking - like, say he keeps it one time, he could start stressing over the fact he didn't donate it, or something similar (EDs aren't logical). It's entirely his sister's issue, she needs to sort herself out, he doesn't need to do anything.", "That's a great idea!  Bake what you want and donate to a homeless shelter or women's shelter.

Getting comfortable preparing food again can be one of the steps towards recovery, sometimes people have had their ED so long they don't understand what a proper meal constitutes, and preparing food is a way to learn this. The next step would be to start eating the food of course, but doing this before someone's comfortable could result in a relapse.", "Binge eating isn't logical either. This is both his and his sister's issue so long as they live in the same household.\n\nMy solution was trying to address that his joy (making food) and her pain (eating food) could be resolved for both while they live together by donating the food and finding more long term therapy solutions for both parties to have healthier relationships with food.\n\nAnother solution? just move out he at least is an adult.", ">The sister has no self control so OP is the one who has to give his stuff away?\n\nOP is giving his stuff away regardless. He says he doesn't really eat the stuff he makes.", "Only one of them is old enough to move out, so his sister has a lot less leeway in how to manage hers. OP doesn't eat what he bakes, so donating or tossing it would be a nice compromise.", "I would to a certain extent agree other than that what's being prepared here is brownies and cakes, not e.g. a salad or a stir fry.\n\nThe point being that OP is preparing large quantities of unhealthy foods that she herself won't eat knowing that her entire family has obesity problems. Doesn't change the fact that if the sister wanted to lose weight, she would make steps towards achieving that goal. Whence ESH, because there's very simple changes both people could make to respect each other's respective EDs. \n\nI feel like if this were alcohol everyone would agree they both suck: one person is responsible for lacking self control, the other for purposefully leaving large quantities of alcohol they themselves don't even drink. The excuse that she'd just go out and buy it is isn't the point. The point is OP supplying someone she knows has no self control around brownies.", "I'm not disagreeing with you, just offering an explanation why baking is useful to someone recovering from an ED. Usually people with a restrictive eating disorder have a list of \"safe\" foods which they ate during their ED, which usually includes salad and might include stir frys, so prepping these isn't really challenging the disordered mindset. High calorie foods can literally be scary to people with an ED, so cooking with these foods helps overcome that fear and get used to them again. It's similar to the analogy you made with alcohol, except buying alcohol doesn't help anyone whereas baking is helping him. I agree with you that a compromise would be the best solution (I went with NAH but that's just like the optimistic version of ESH.)\n\nEdit: I'm not a professional, but struggled with an ED in the past and I'm just going off the advice I got back then", "Thanks! It's a pickle all around!"]}
