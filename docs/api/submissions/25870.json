We plan on having about 40 guests, mostly from his side as I only have one living relative whereas he comes from a large family.\n\nI set up a wedding website last night and on it I gave our Registry with a link to our Wishlist from an online store for inspiration. The Wishlist had a whole bunch of household items (kettles, toasters etc) ranging in price, with all of them coming in at under $50. The cheapest item on it was a set of ceramic measuring spoons at $15, the most expensive was a porcelain dinner set at $49.\n\nWhen I asked my partner to look through everything on the website, he told me that his extended family members won't be expecting to give us any gifts at our wedding. He said that at most we might get a bottle of wine from somebody (I don't drink alcohol), but that we would not get anything from his aunts, uncles, cousins etc so doing a Registry is \"a bit much\" given nobody is going to look at it.\n\nI was absolutely shocked - I think it is the height of bad manners to attend a party (whether it's a wedding or a birthday or whatnot) and not bring a gift of some sort. I cannot imagine going to an event someone has organised for me - eating a three course meal they've paid for, dancing to a DJ they've paid for, drinking the drinks they've paid for - and not even bothering to buy them a $15 kettle. I think it's extremely entitled and lacking in any class.\n\nI know that if someone came to the wedding and did not give a gift, I would find it deeply disrespectful and it would sour the whole event for me. So, I told him that if any of his relatives could not be bothered to bring a gift to the wedding then I would rather they not attend at all. I told him I'm not happy paying to entertain someone who can't even show the good manners to offer a token \"thank you\" on the day. For me it's not about the gifts - we already have a perfectly fine toaster etc - it's about the principle of showing thanks for time, money, effort etc spent on giving everyone a good time.\n\nMy partner thinks I am overreacting and acting like a diva bride, that it is perfectly fine for his relatives to give us nothing on our wedding day and that I need to stop getting my ideas on what weddings look like from social media.\n\nTo be clear, his relatives are all local so there are no associated costs (travel, accommodation etc) to attending the wedding. They have a spare couple of dollars to buy a measuring jug or whatever. Our wedding - while small - will see all guests receive a free three course meal, drinks, disco and ride home at the end of the night. So, they will all be fully looked after.\n\nAITA for telling my partner that if his extended family have no intention of giving us a gift at our wedding then I would rather they don't attend?\n\nEDIT: The wedding is entirely self-funded. We are both in our 30s with careers. I wanted us to elope with our parents but he wanted us to have a \"proper\" wedding.", "created_utc": 1693418763, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165m0nr/aita_for_uninviting_my_partners_family_from_our/", "score": 981, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, you would be TA if you uninvite your partner's entire family on the basis he doesn't think they will not get you anything - you might as well not get married as I'd be amazed if your new marriage could survive the drama and grief you and your new husband would get.

Are you getting married for the gifts, or for the man you have chosen to spend the rest of your life with?

You have chosen this to be your hill and I fear that you will not make it out.", "YTA - Wow. Okay, yes - it is customary to give a gift when you attend a wedding. But your reaction is way over the top. Wedding are celebrations, not transactions. \n\nYou should be inviting people to your wedding because you want them to be a part of this important milestone in your life. Not because you want a new toaster. \n\nYour guests are not responsible for the fact that you are providing a three course meal and DJ. You are choosing those things and inviting people to enjoy them with you in celebration of your wedding. \n\nI can understand why you were surprised when your partner shared this information with you.

Whilst everyone always says gifts are not an expectation I would never dream of showing up to someone\u2019s wedding without a gift.

The point of a wedding is to show everyone how much you and your partner love each other, and to let your extended friends / family / various people you care about to celebrate that with you. If people choose to give you stuff to help with that celebration, well that's just added sprinkles on the cupcake. I couldn't imagine asking for specific items from our friends and family in exchange for attendance.\n\nGranted the last wedding we went to I did make a small gift to commemorate the occasion, but it was just a daft cutesy memento of the event, not something that the individuals could cheerfully buy from any shop as and when they found the need for it.", "YTA, time to not get married into this family if your expectation is they owe you a gift.", "YTA. The ever growing entitlement of people getting married when it comes to gifts is getting out of hand, particularly when you're in your 30s and not just starting out your life together.

Why would no gifts be expected from these family members. Is this a cultural thing. Can they not afford it. If they had a wedding would they expect gifts from you?", "YTA\n\nRather than dictating what you think is good manners, or classy, or whatever other word you want to use, you could talk to your fiance, and understand why it doesn't appear normal to give wedding gifts in his family. I'll agree with you that your expectations are the general norm, but apparently none of his family has the same assumptions. Have you tried to understand why?", "ESH   \n\nAnd this is a little weird.

First off, why would you put a toaster on a registry if you didn't want a toaster and think the one you have is perfectly fine? Second, if you straight-up uninvite people from a wedding because they might not bring gifts ***then yes it is absolutely about the gifts***. \n\nI'll say it again: you don't uninvite people for not bringing gifts if you don't care about the gifts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt any rate, as other people have said, since it quite obviously *is* about the gifts, why not just elope then throw a party?

Gifts should be an afterthought, not your primary focus. \n\nEveryone ought to grow up a bit here.", "I get both your points.  I would scale down immediately.   If they don't bring a gift or cash for the couple, why are you working so hard to ensure a good time?\n\nFrom his perspective.....why is that? Are they that way about everything? Birthdays? Holidays? Or just weddings?\n\nTotally possible to meet in the middle on this. I'm more curious about why his family can't even ve arsed to get cards.  Wtf is that?", "YTA You are choosing to spend all that money on YOUR wedding. Expecting and demanding gifts is also entitlement.", "YTA.  How are they the \"entitled\" ones when you're demanding gifts of items you admit you already have? Technically (not saying I agree with it, but technically), it's the \"height of bad manners\" to have a wedding website with a link to your registry.", "NAH.\n\nIt's good to have expectations and traditions laid out now, rather than later on. You are following tradition, your partner is advising you that his family will not follow that.\n\nSerious question - given how this has affected your mood, do you even want a formal ceremony/reception at this point? You might be happier to just have a very intimate ceremony  with only the closest relatives and a nice dinner with them afterwards, rather than going to any trouble of throwing a big event.", "Yta.  Gifts are nice but it's not a necessity.  You'll be setting yourself up for a possibly rough life with them if you don't invite them to the wedding.", "YTA.  A wedding invite is NOT an invoice. A gift is nice but not an admission fee. Climb down off your entitled horse, apologize to your fianc\u00e9 and realize that not everyone acts the same.", "NTA. If it was more 50:50 with the invitations then I might be inclined to go with N A H - but given you guys are only paying for a bigger event to accommodate his family then this does just seem\u2026 off. \n\nIt\u2019s good that it\u2019s been flushed out before the wedding though. Is this the only \u201cphilosophy of life\u201d item that you guys haven\u2019t already discussed in advance?\n\nHopefully the big ones - children, budgeting, pensions, religion, politics, ethics, etc - have already been discussed.\n\nImportant question to ask him though: what other aspects of life does he consider it normal for him to fully fund for his family, while getting nothing in return?  Are you ok with that list of things?", "Invoking a \u201clack of class\u201d when you want to disinvite the grooms family over not getting $15 kettle is beyond ironic.

They sound like a bunch of freeloaders.", "YTA. A wedding invitation is NOT an invoice. You invite people as your guests, meaning you want them there and feed and entertain them on your dime, without expecting to collect tribute from them. Your partner has the right attitude.

Having a Registry list is nice, but a handmade candle holder, made with love, is just as nice (yes, one of our guests made a Fairy House tea-light holder which is still on display 26 years later - most of the other gifts are long gone, broken, used up or just replaced through normal usage).", "Yta a wedding is not a ticketed event where the ticket is a gift.", "Here's a wild take- Does he actually know this? My husband really didn't know much about weddings and may have thought the same thing. I think it would be odd for people to not bring anything. If this is in the US, it is customary and I haven't heard of a situation where no one brings a gift/card. However, YTA for making it about the gifts. Would it be weird? Yes but that's not the purpose of the event. They don't owe you anything, you invited them.", "YTA. It is the height of bad manners to make invitations to a social event contingent on the gift one expects to receive (or not).\n\nAlso, you and your fianc\u00e9 seem to think no physical gift = no gift, whereas in many social circles people do not bring a physical gift to a wedding but they do gift a card with a monetary gift enclosed.", "> For me it's not about the gifts - we already have a perfectly fine toaster etc - it's about the principle of showing thanks for time,\n\nYTA. Of course it's about the gifts.", "YTA - do you know why it isn't customary for his family to get wedding gifts?  And honestly, does he really know what his family is going to do?  Frankly, some men are clueless.  And with registries shipping directly to the recipient, gifts are often not carted to the ceremony.  He may not have seen the behind-the-scenes gift exchanges at previous weddings.  Or his family may have a previously determined rule that they forego wedding gifts.  But you should pay for the ceremony and reception that makes you happy and helps you celebrate your union.  The gifts are something you shouldn't count on, but if you get any, you can appreciate and enjoy.", "YTA if you wanted gifts, buy them and elope. Stop your nonsense.", "I agree with the partner, you're overreacting. You're throwing a party to celebrate your wedding, not to entice others to bring a gift. He tried to manage your expectations by warning you they probably wouldn't bring a gift. What are you going to do, require them to bring a gift? Like no gift, no access? What if they double down and nobody comes.... would that be better than having a nice wedding party where people have fun and you celebrate your union? And you want them to buy stuff you already have. Why? If you unvite them now, because you think they won't bring a gift, definitely YTA. It's showing you're materialistic and don't consider someone's heartfelt attention at this party for you and your husband 'worth it'. I wonder how far this materialistic side goes and if you equate love with financial gain. Are you marrying your partner for money as well? Or because you actually like him for who he is, not how much he makes. I think you should think about your priorities. What is love to you?", "Think about all the money you will save not having to buy gifts for his side of the family.", "YTA, you are acting like a diva.

It's customary to give wedding gifts, and it seems like a reasonable registry. Weddings, even small ones, aren't run of the mill parties, and even simple ones are expensive.\n\nEdit: even in poorer cultures, if they don't give a gift they'll usually contribute time/skills to the event. This isn't a BBQ, it's a wedding. And assuming it's American given the dollar sign.", "YTA yes its customary to bring a gift to say congradulations but its not set in stone that it works that way.

Especially when the bride and groom are covering all wedding costs.

We plan on having about 40 guests, mostly from his side as I only have one living relative whereas he comes from a large family.\r  \n\r  \nI set up a wedding website last night and on it I gave our Registry with a link to our Wishlist from an online store for inspiration. The Wishlist had a whole bunch of household items (kettles, toasters etc) ranging in price, with all of them coming in at under $50. The cheapest item on it was a set of ceramic measuring spoons at $15, the most expensive was a porcelain dinner set at $49.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I asked my partner to look through everything on the website, he told me that his extended family members won't be expecting to give us any gifts at our wedding.

It\u2019s about your people coming together to support the newlyweds in their community as they begin their new lives together! \n\nThat\u2019s why all the gifts are stuff like *\u201ckitchen sets, toasters, sofa covers\u201d* it comes from the fact that many newlyweds have not been completely financially stable, or they just straight up dont have items to \u201cstart a home with\u201d. So their community member\u2019s band together (esp ones already married) to donate personal items, buy, or make things to help the new couple get started. It\u2019s also a way of giving them best wishes for the new life they\u2019re starting. \n\nThat\u2019s also why many families have items that have been passed down for generations. Those items were passed down during weddings. \n\nIt\u2019s also where the tradition of *\u201dgifting bridal jewelry\u201d*  comes from. The idea is that women for most of history havent had access to money, so the women in the community would donate silver but mostly gold jewelry to the bride in case her partner mistreats her, she can sell the jewelry and have a better chance of escaping an abusive relationship. \n\nObviously things aren\u2019t exactly the same as they used to, but i feel like wedding gifts are still a very powerful tradition that represents the love and well wishes of the couples community. It\u2019s a display of support that symbolizes your people will be there for you on this new journey, you\u2019re not doing it alone, a piece of your loved ones literally live inside your home. If you feel overwhelmed and dont know what to do, you can look in every corner if your home and see all the people who are willing to help you out. \n\nTraditions are what connect us to our past, present, and future.

Plus theres the added bonus of not having to pretend weddings are about \u2018celebrating a couple\u2019 instead of the money grabs they\u2019ve become.", "Good etiquette means overlooking poor manners in others.  OP's planned preemptive strike is the height of foolishness and bad manners.", "That explains everything!!! Of course his family is British. Give up now - they are generally unable to deal with common societal norms. Bringing a gift to a wedding is literally the norm in every country, but I would completely expect to be disappointed by the British side if I married my partner (he's British).\n\nI got invited to a wedding here once, put a bit of money into an envelope as a gift. We get there and discover that the ceremony and food had been reserved for a few \"closer family\" guests, and the invitation we got amounted to... Hearing music play? There was no buffet, no free drinks. We got to eat a tiny piece of cake though! We were so befuddled, hadn't eaten in advance of course, ended up having to go to a pizza shop for dinner as no food was even served on the premises. After that time, I expect to be disappointed by British weddings as standard, and possibly shall not bring gifts anymore even though I think it's the height of rudeness not to.\n\nLong story short, it's possible his extended family is expecting to not receive any food or drinks, or to have to pay for it, or to be fed crisps from Tesco rather than an actual meal. With that in mind, of course they wouldn't bring gifts. \nAlso wedding registries are apparently not a thing here - I find them very helpful as I have no idea what to get people most of the time, but people here think it's weird to \"ask for gifts\". Only to then literally point blank ask their close family \"what do you want\" at Christmas and buying what they say. How's that any different, I'd like to have it explained. \n\nDon't get me wrong I love Britons but some of the customs make me lose hope. I'm Italian so I know what a proper wedding looks like - I also have been living in the UK long enough that I have a more \"nuanced\" view of these things, but there are limits. Some people will call them cultural differences, I call it being tight.\n\nThat being said, OP don't uninvite the family! Simply adjust the offering accordingly, to a level you're comfortable with. Also remember that when they go low you should go higher, don't stoop to their level and make them pay for food. But you may want to limit drinking to one free drink (also if they're Britons there's every chance they'll get absolutely hammered) or none, and forget about the gifts. Enjoy their company for who they are, and try not to be petty. On the plus side, when the cousins get married you get to not buy them gifts! Also prepare to possibly pay for your food as well though. *Sighs*", "Back in the 70s most people would not have their kids wearing pink yes, but that\u2019s literally not my point and you know that.\n\nMy point is, it would be considered very rude to give kids pink back then. \n\nSo what are you even arguing?", "Are you kidding me?\n\nBack then if you were to ever give somebody something pink for a boy to wear for a baby shower (or in general) it was considered very rude.", "Really?  Because i remember '89 being very Barbiesque for boys and men", "There's a difference between dressing a bit in pink, and giving a pink outfit as a present for a baby.\n\nIt would still generally be considered weird to give pink or otherwise girly clothes for a male baby shower.", "When we got married we specifically said we wanted cash to fund spending money on our honeymoon. We didn't need household goods or anything as we had been living together for four years by the time we were getting married.

Who does this? Who \"uninvites\" future family over a gift? Why don't you just charge everyone for the meal and charge an admission fee?

Well if he wants you to have a \u2018proper\u2019 wedding inform him that absolutely includes gifts from the guests as a token of appreciate for the invite to your special day and also your new life together.

I would do your registry, have a big party with his family and see how things go.  Some people are brought up to bring gifts to parties, some are not.  Try and have fun on your big day.  You will likely learn a lot about his family at any rate and that can only be useful.", "That's so bizarre to me, where I live no one would even dream of attending a wedding without bringing a gift (usually it's money), hell sometimes we even send gifts while not attending. I mean it may sound kind of \"assholeish\" to uninvite someone for not bringing a gift but here it is considered beyond rude to go to a wedding without bringing a gift (btw a bottle of wine would be HIGHLY inappropriate) and I've never even heard of someone doing that.

I completely agree that it's very bad manners to not give a gift at a wedding.  You're not being entitled at all since all the gifts in the registry are sensible and affordable to most people. It's not about you wanting to get gifts, as some people on here are suggesting.  It's about the fact that the family should want to wish you well and show their support for your marriage by giving you a small home-related gift.    It's no different to turning up at someone's birthday party without a present for them.  It's just rude.", "ESH\n\nYou're not giving them a party, you are getting married. It's your celebration, not an obligation for them to attend. Maybe it's where I'm from, but I think it's rude to tell people what gifts you're looking to get. Not getting a gift isn't a deal-breaker, it's just rude.\n\nAlso, if I was invited to a wedding, it'd be a prerogative to get a gift. A register may not be necessary but it's common etiquette to bring something nice. Hell, we bring gifts for simple dinners and birthdays, so why not the wedding of a loved one?", "I think we come from backgrounds or experiences where we both agree that you MUST bring a gift to a wedding.

For his family is not something they do, she has to accept that. It sounds like the only reason she agreed to the wedding was because of the gifts.

By the late 1800s, it was a common practice to have all the wedding presents out on display at the wedding reception or breakfast, so the idea of not having wedding gifts at the reception is a new one, likely tied to the fact that people are no longer frequently having receptions out of homes, therefore making it more inconvenient to have to tote bulky presents about"]}
