We plan on having about 40 guests, mostly from his side as I only have one living relative whereas he comes from a large family.\n\nI set up a wedding website last night and on it I gave our Registry with a link to our Wishlist from an online store for inspiration. The Wishlist had a whole bunch of household items (kettles, toasters etc) ranging in price, with all of them coming in at under $50. The cheapest item on it was a set of ceramic measuring spoons at $15, the most expensive was a porcelain dinner set at $49.\n\nWhen I asked my partner to look through everything on the website, he told me that his extended family members won't be expecting to give us any gifts at our wedding. He said that at most we might get a bottle of wine from somebody (I don't drink alcohol), but that we would not get anything from his aunts, uncles, cousins etc so doing a Registry is \"a bit much\" given nobody is going to look at it.\n\nI was absolutely shocked - I think it is the height of bad manners to attend a party (whether it's a wedding or a birthday or whatnot) and not bring a gift of some sort. I cannot imagine going to an event someone has organised for me - eating a three course meal they've paid for, dancing to a DJ they've paid for, drinking the drinks they've paid for - and not even bothering to buy them a $15 kettle. I think it's extremely entitled and lacking in any class.\n\nI know that if someone came to the wedding and did not give a gift, I would find it deeply disrespectful and it would sour the whole event for me. So, I told him that if any of his relatives could not be bothered to bring a gift to the wedding then I would rather they not attend at all. I told him I'm not happy paying to entertain someone who can't even show the good manners to offer a token \"thank you\" on the day. For me it's not about the gifts - we already have a perfectly fine toaster etc - it's about the principle of showing thanks for time, money, effort etc spent on giving everyone a good time.\n\nMy partner thinks I am overreacting and acting like a diva bride, that it is perfectly fine for his relatives to give us nothing on our wedding day and that I need to stop getting my ideas on what weddings look like from social media.\n\nTo be clear, his relatives are all local so there are no associated costs (travel, accommodation etc) to attending the wedding. They have a spare couple of dollars to buy a measuring jug or whatever. Our wedding - while small - will see all guests receive a free three course meal, drinks, disco and ride home at the end of the night. So, they will all be fully looked after.\n\nAITA for telling my partner that if his extended family have no intention of giving us a gift at our wedding then I would rather they don't attend?  \n\n\nEDIT: The wedding is entirely self-funded. Nobody apart from my partner and I are contributing anything toward the costs of the wedding.

However, you would be TA if you uninvite your partner's entire family on the basis he doesn't think they will not get you anything - you might as well not get married as I'd be amazed if your new marriage could survive the drama and grief you and your new husband would get.

But your reaction is way over the top. Wedding are celebrations, not transactions. \n\nYou should be inviting people to your wedding because you want them to be a part of this important milestone in your life. Not because you want a new toaster. \n\nYour guests are not responsible for the fact that you are providing a three course meal and DJ.

The point of a wedding is to show everyone how much you and your partner love each other, and to let your extended friends / family / various people you care about to celebrate that with you. If people choose to give you stuff to help with that celebration, well that's just added sprinkles on the cupcake. I couldn't imagine asking for specific items from our friends and family in exchange for attendance.\n\nGranted the last wedding we went to I did make a small gift to commemorate the occasion, but it was just a daft cutesy memento of the event, not something that the individuals could cheerfully buy from any shop as and when they found the need for it.", "YTA, time to not get married into this family if your expectation is they owe you a gift.", "YTA. The ever growing entitlement of people getting married when it comes to gifts is getting out of hand, particularly when you're in your 30s and not just starting out your life together.

Second, if you straight-up uninvite people from a wedding because they might not bring gifts ***then yes it is absolutely about the gifts***. \n\nI'll say it again: you don't uninvite people for not bringing gifts if you don't care about the gifts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt any rate, as other people have said, since it quite obviously *is* about the gifts, why not just elope then throw a party?

You are following tradition, your partner is advising you that his family will not follow that.\n\nSerious question - given how this has affected your mood, do you even want a formal ceremony/reception at this point? You might be happier to just have a very intimate ceremony  with only the closest relatives and a nice dinner with them afterwards, rather than going to any trouble of throwing a big event.", "Yta.  Gifts are nice but it's not a necessity.  You'll be setting yourself up for a possibly rough life with them if you don't invite them to the wedding.", "YTA.  A wedding invite is NOT an invoice.

They sound like a bunch of freeloaders.", "YTA. A wedding invitation is NOT an invoice.

Yes but that's not the purpose of the event. They don't owe you anything, you invited them.", "YTA. It is the height of bad manners to make invitations to a social event contingent on the gift one expects to receive (or not).\n\nAlso, you and your fianc\u00e9 seem to think no physical gift = no gift, whereas in many social circles people do not bring a physical gift to a wedding but they do gift a card with a monetary gift enclosed.", "> For me it's not about the gifts - we already have a perfectly fine toaster etc - it's about the principle of showing thanks for time,\n\nYTA.

Frankly, some men are clueless.  And with registries shipping directly to the recipient, gifts are often not carted to the ceremony.  He may not have seen the behind-the-scenes gift exchanges at previous weddings.  Or his family may have a previously determined rule that they forego wedding gifts.  But you should pay for the ceremony and reception that makes you happy and helps you celebrate your union.  The gifts are something you shouldn't count on, but if you get any, you can appreciate and enjoy.", "YTA if you wanted gifts, buy them and elope. Stop your nonsense.", "I agree with the partner, you're overreacting. You're throwing a party to celebrate your wedding, not to entice others to bring a gift. He tried to manage your expectations by warning you they probably wouldn't bring a gift. What are you going to do, require them to bring a gift? Like no gift, no access? What if they double down and nobody comes.... would that be better than having a nice wedding party where people have fun and you celebrate your union? And you want them to buy stuff you already have. Why? If you unvite them now, because you think they won't bring a gift, definitely YTA. It's showing you're materialistic and don't consider someone's heartfelt attention at this party for you and your husband 'worth it'. I wonder how far this materialistic side goes and if you equate love with financial gain. Are you marrying your partner for money as well?

What is love to you?", "Think about all the money you will save not having to buy gifts for his side of the family.", "YTA, you are acting like a diva.

Weddings, even small ones, aren't run of the mill parties, and even simple ones are expensive.\n\nEdit: even in poorer cultures, if they don't give a gift they'll usually contribute time/skills to the event.

The Wishlist had a whole bunch of household items (kettles, toasters etc) ranging in price, with all of them coming in at under $50. The cheapest item on it was a set of ceramic measuring spoons at $15, the most expensive was a porcelain dinner set at $49.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I asked my partner to look through everything on the website, he told me that his extended family members won't be expecting to give us any gifts at our wedding.

I cannot imagine going to an event someone has organised for me - eating a three course meal they've paid for, dancing to a DJ they've paid for, drinking the drinks they've paid for - and not even bothering to buy them a $15 kettle.
