It's been a range of her stealing my food, breaking/ruining my stuff, v@ping in the space when I have asked her not to (on many, many occasions) and not doing any part in cleaning for the entire time we have been here. However, the most reoccurring issue has been her taking phone calls in the room. \n\nPlease note that there is a private kitchen/living room and bathroom in our space, as well as lounges with couches that would be empty at this time of night. There are other places she could go to take these phone calls and still be comfortable.\n\nSince the first night, she stays on phone calls ALL DAY with her boyfriend. While mildly annoying, it would be bearable if it wasn't also ALL NIGHT as well. When I mean all night, I mean until about 6am. I have asked her since the second or third day to not do this. I told her if she needs to take the phone calls, she should go into the kitchen. \n\nShe continues to do it, and every time I ask her to stop, she tells me that she will and continues to do it anyway. She doesn't even wear airpods, and I can hear not just her, but also the person on the other end of the phone. \n\nI can't sleep and I have an important job interview today. I felt overwhelmed, tired, and sick of this behavior and so I just broke down and asked her why she was so inconsiderate. I told her to grow up and act like an adult, and I shouldn't have to sacrifice my sleep and mental wellbeing for her phone calls. I told her that I'm paying the same amount as she is for this space and that her comfort isn't more important than mine.\n\nShe told me that I was trying to manipulate her with and she shouldn't be \"stuck\" in the kitchen for 24 hours a day when her back hurts. I told her that I don't care if her back hurts and that she can get off the call if it's really that bad. \n\nAITA for telling her this?
