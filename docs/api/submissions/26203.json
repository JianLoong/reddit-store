I'm not privy to y'all's exact situation obviously but even with an easy kid and support from family and whatnot it can't have been easy to do it at that age, all the while I imagine all of her friends were doing college applications and spring breaks. To basically irreversibly tie yourself down to one thing for the rest of your life when you're still a teen is bound to leave space for some \"what if\" that can easily turn into resentment, and that's not incompatible with loving your kid and the life you have now.\nEither this or she is just one of those people who can't fathom happiness outside of children.\nIn both cases tho she needs to back the fuck off.", "In this day and age, when we're not medieval peasants in need of more arms for the farms or nobles in need of an heir and when our lifespan is much longer and financial stability comes much later and usually after either studying or gaining years if working experience, no, it's not normal to have kids so young and shouldn't be encouraged. Or, I guess it's normal in the sense that it happens, and in most cases (not all) that's a pity and the consequence of a mistake. I could care less about what people did through human history, we also used to die form the cold but you don't see people doing that anymore because thankfully we advanced.\nI'm sure there are cases of young people that are perfectly equipped for a kid at that age and maybe they even sought that out because they had the means to do so, good for them. But lets not pretend most cases of 18 y.o. mothers are like that. If you seriously think being pregnant before 20 in 2023 while living with your parents and before even having any idea of what adult life actually entails (even without a kid) is something to be celebrated, then I seriously pity any minor that could end up in your care.\nEDIT I should specify this is a western world perspective, I'm aware it works differently in many other places, but that's usually because the local cultural norms make it more feasible (ex. multi-generational living when you have an actual village to help you take care of the child). Still doesn't appeal to me personally, but I can see how it's more common and sustainable in those cases.", "I bet.

To me, 30 is young to be having kids lol, I wish more young people understood that most people aren\u2019t really adults until 25-27, and 30 is totally a great time to start a family vs 20.", "Lol you realize having kids young was normal until like the 1990s right?  You think thats the stone age? And in plenty of other cultures still is, and its not all about society biologically speaking people often have kids young on purpose  because that's when your fertility is in its prime which DOES affect how healthy and close to their genetic potential your kid turns out to be and that's also when your body is most regenerative if you are worried about the effects its going to have on appearance doing it before ur late 20s basically prevents most of that from being permanent because your bodies cells are still healing faster than their dying until your late 20s", "congrats for making choices for yourself and not letting sis push you around. she decides for her, you decide for you. nta.", "For Americans I believe they say college to mean what we would call university", "I think she\u2019s jealous of the fact that you aren\u2019t saddled with a kiddo and she is", "Yeah. We was all very supportive of my sister and I myself was excited/ still am excited to be an aunt. I learn new things from that kid everyday\ud83e\udd23. But it is nice to have \"freedom\" at my age, as much as i thought i wanted a child when i fell pregnant I look back and think i don't actually want one. I'm in no way shape or form glad I miscarried it was/ still is a hard time but I want to live my young adulthood before I even think about children again", "PS I am so very sorry for your loss, can't imagine how hard it must have been", "To me it's the sheer impossibility to back down, like you can't just give the kid away (not without some major emotional implication at the very least) so your life will pretty much revolve around them one way or the other forever. And to be making that decision without a fully developed frontal cortex at least? Before even having a concept of what working and living on your own, let alone with a baby, means? Uff. I'm 27 and single with partial support from my parents and even then I still get flabbergasted at how _hard_ and expensive everything is, especially right now.\nAbout the \"body bounce back\" stuff, let me preface this by saying that I'm childfree to the point I will tear my uterus out with a rusty fork before I have a kid, and partly because I couldn't deal with the body horror that comes with it. But if I were to imagine having one, and basing on what I heard the long term effects can be, I'd have it later because the least amount of years I risk living without a functioning bladder the better \ud83d\ude02", "So was smoking indoors but we moved past that luckily. And you're forgetting the rampant sexism that made it so common, were not completely past that still but we progressed a bit at least. Plus, find me a place where the economy stayed the same as it was in the 80's and maybe we can talk. And I addressed the culture part in my edit.", "In the US, they are interchangeable - although there are differences. You can go to Harvard College, but Harvard is actually multiple schools and Harvard is but one of the schools that makes up Harvard University.\n\nIn the UK, colleges are a bit different - they make up the university, but they are something of a cross between a sorority/fraternity, college, and an academic focus. Or thus it was explained when I looked into pursuing my postgraduate studies over in the UK. Which is another term which differs. In the US they are considered graduate studies while in the UK they are post-graduate studies.\n\nI am far from an expert though.", "I understand that so much", "It's okay im healing slowly", "I'll agree that the economy makes it morre difficult now but dont act like it's because of some kind of social progress, it's literally just because people can't afford to start a family at the ideal age and that's not ok that's not progress lol", "\"We moved passed that\" did you ignore the part where I said it's still the most biologically ideal age to have kids either way, your social justice doesnt change the fact that egg count drops dramatically in the 30s and its not sexist to acknowledge and be aware of that", "It's partly that and partly because of people and especially women realizing there's more to life than just breeding and having more options overall. Women can work and have something other than a family and are not forced to rely on a man and the wife-and-mother status for their stability anymore and, surprise surprise, most of them are choosing not to do so. And when they do choose to do it, they know they have more time to complete the things that they want to first and choose a suitable partner without throwing themselves at the first dude that comes their way because there's way less societal pressure for the to do so.", "Did you ignore the part where I said I don't give a fuck? Biology is the most common thing to use to justify bringing back situations of inequality and discrimination. The Evolution of the medical field allowed us to have kids safely after 30 just as it allowed us to not die from a paper cut and we should take full advantage of that. And don't act like most people in the western world from the last couple of generations didn't come from 30+ parents ant turned out perfectly fine. And since we're speaking biology, sperm quality is also significantly worse after 40 so if you're going to use it to justify your glorification of teen pregnancies at least do it both ways.", "I mean yea it's easy to make an unintelligent argument when you simply don't give a fuck I suppose", "Modern medicine isn't powerful enough to change when your fertility peaks which is 18-25, no you dont need to be that young to safely have kids anymore but you clearly don't know how genetics work, kids who are had to a young mother are on average better looking, more athletic and healthier overall as in less likley to have health or mental issues, and have higher iq, because guess what...more eggs to choose from, not rocket science", "Way to focus on the provocative part of the comment and ignore literally everything else I say, talk about an unintelligent argument \ud83d\udc4d", "Guess we're all sick weak and on the brink of extinction and just didn't realize it then, you should go on the news or something and point that out.\nAnd, again, if you're going to hide behind biology at least do it properly and address the low quality of sperm after 40 then, because this is starting to smell less like a biological concern and more like a sexist one with every comment, to absolutely no one's surprise."]}
