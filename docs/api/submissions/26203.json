Your sister needs to stop making you having/not having kids about her. That's a personal decision that has jack shit to do with her.", "Second post today asking if OP is an AH for not wanting to have children for the sake of a family member's notions. In what realm would you be an AH here?", "NTA and you are technically still a teenager.  You have your whole life ahead of you.  Why is she rushing you?", "NTA\n\nThis kind of behavior wouldn't be okay at any age, but you're 18 and this is ridiculous. Your sister sounds like she is trying to secondhand baby trap you and it's very weird.", "NTA. Your body, your choice.", "You do not owe your sister the title of \"auntie\", especially while still so young.  One way to silence her nagging might be to inform her, very calmly but clearly, that every time she mentions wanting a niece or nephew it makes you even more determined NOT to have a child.  If that doesn't work, enlist a sympathetic family member to have the same discussion with her.", "NTA - Honestly that she's asking an 18 year old that is crazy to me. Like your life is just starting and you should already have a baby? me thinks not. Even if you wanted children she shouldn't be rushing you. And also it's gross that she knows that less than a year ago you miscarried and she's still asking this.", "NTA, your sister is\u2026 having BBC a baby so young and in this economy\u2026 and the trauma you\u2019ve already experienced\u2026 you just live your life how YOU want to", "NTA. Pregnancy only gets harder. The first two months were easy.", "NTA. Sis needs to step back.", "You are NTA but your sister is! You're 18 why is she asking that of you and putting pressure on you. Such inappropriate behavior. Ask her why she is so desperate for you to have children at such a young age. Who knows what the future holds you and your boyfriend may not be endgame. \n\nTell her to have more children if she wants another child around. Something really isn't right about how she is acting towards you.", "Nta", "Let her be upset.\n\nAlso don't tell people what you guys want. \\*Why she gotta know for?\\*  \nJust because your baby isn't here doesnt mean you didn't have it and it's still a space you can take. Or not take. Whatever you want.  \nAnd you are probably sick and tired of people telling you to be ok your own way but that really is what they want for you.\n\nBut it starts with not oversharing. Contrary to popular belief, you should keep that wall right up. You are walking wounded and you need to worry about shelter and not having people dump stress on you. Can you do that?\n\nTelling her to back all the way off was a great start.", "Let her be upset. Not your problem.\n\nShe is more than welcome to mind her own business in the future.

I'm assuming you never demanded she have a kid so you could be an aunt. You're 18. Even if you did decide to have children, you're still young. Plenty of time for that IF it's something you ever change your mind about. Most importantly, you're going through something she obviously doesn't seem to understand. She needs to back off and give you the space you need to process, grieve and mentally heal. She is TA, not you.", "NTA. This is just bizarre I mean considering you had a miscarriage it\u2019s a pretty insensitive thing to do anyway but then really weird when you\u2019re only 18, I kind of feel the overwhelming majority of 18 year olds do not want children at that age. Guessing she wants a playmate for her kid.", "NTA. Not even a little. \n\nNot only are you only 18, which just makes this even worse in my opinion, but you\u2019re not obligated to \u201cgive\u201d her a niece/nephew. \n\nHer \u201cmaking\u201d you an aunt is completely irrelevant. It\u2019s a child ffs. You should only have them if YOU want them. Literally no one else\u2019s opinion matters here.", "Nta she kept pushing it. You're not obligated to have children to satisfy other people, even though many people act like we are. Lots of people don't want kids - there's a whole childfree thread!", "NTA.  It's none of her business.  I'm sorry for what you went through.", "Asking for a niece or nephew???  You\u2019re still a teenager!!!  If or when you decide to have children, it should be your choice and on your timetable. But hopefully not while your a teenager.  That said, I\u2019m so sorry you had to experience a miscarriage. \n\nNTA", "NTA it's up to when or if you have kids, I wouldn't feel pressured into it", "NTA. I would have lost it too.", "NTA.    It\u2019s absolutely none of her business, and it\u2019s completely out of line for her to try and nag you into creating a human that you don\u2019t want to do so that her kid has a cousin to play with and she can call herself an auntie.", "You're absolutely not TA ,considering the fact that you're so young and already went trough a misscarriege which will put damage on even the strongest individuals.It's your decision if you want kids or not she can't tell you what to do.And about you being an auntie a her not well you didn't ask for it it was her choice so you've done no weong.Stay strong and don't let her get to you, it's your life and choice afterall!", "Good god, you are a teenager FFS! NTA. Let her sulk.", "NTA.. you have every right to not want children", "NTA..you are literally 18, still a teenager. In some countries, you can't even drink yet. If you have pet, put a dress or shirt in it and \"say, here's your niece/nephew\". That shut up my dad when he bugged me about grandchildren for yrs..sent him a pic of my cats in baby clothes.", "NTA\n\nI seriously hate people who try and pressure other people into having kids. \n\nIt's your decision, not hers. It's completely unreasonable for her to force the issue and try and guilt you into it. Sorry that you got pregnant, even when trying not to. It might be wise to double down on birth control.", "NTA agreed, but: Op isn\u2018t \u201enot sure about\u2026\u201c, she is sure about not going to have a child and that\u2018s perfectly fine. Second: \u201e[so] don\u2019t get pregnant\u201c  is, especially consodering the circumstances, kind of an insensitive way to say \u201emake your own choices\u201c. no offense, but i find these distinctions very important.", "Probably sick of seeing her sister untethered and being able to enjoy freedom in her young adulthood.", "Not that weird; op\u2019s sister probably envies op\u2019s freedom and would like to put an end to it.\n\nForgot to say: NTA", "This is SUPER subjective. I ended up in the hospital multiple times during the first two months (which continued throughout the pregnancy and lead to a premature birth at 33 weeks).", "I agree the two months of pregnancy I went through were horrible and also the constant worry of is everything okay.", "Your ancedote doesn't really contradict the claim that pregnancy gets harder.", "Pregnancy is so hard! Thankfully everything worked out okay for me at the end (minus the HG and funneling/shortened cervix) but I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone who didn\u2019t want children. I\u2019m not much older than you, OP (I\u2019m 21) but I would say not wanting children is your decision. Your sister needs to back off. If you decide in the future that you do want children, that\u2019s wonderful, but if you never want them & that is what is perfect for you (as you know yourself better than anyone else), who has the right to accost you about it?", "The point of what I was saying was that the entire pregnancy was hell. The first two months weren\u2019t any easier than the five months that followed. They were just different kinds of hell, with some of the same kinds remaining. Regardless, the comment directed towards OP came across as incredibly demeaning to her experience (& the pain associated with it) which is decidedly not okay.", "yeah. I'm so sorry you had to go through that though I hope you and your child are doing well", "It\u2019s all good! He is just about 4 months old now & huge & happy (minus teething \ud83e\udee3)"]}
