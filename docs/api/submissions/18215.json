I talked to family about mortgages, when we\u2019d be ready etc. I texted this to fianc\u00e9 who was working.I saw a house up for sale that was perfect.

Not only had he been lying to me, but we\u2019re never going to be approved for a mortgage when it\u2019s clear he\u2019s always gambling. I feel betrayed. He has been snippy with me for ages.

After things calmed down he stormed out at 3am bc I said it would have been nice to live in that house, cause I liked the sunroom.

He came by last night to pick up clothes and we talked. We need time apart, but he said that he will be single forever if not with me, and if I could change how I speak, he would love to still be together. Apparently I make him a better person. I was set up for a future with him but he will always be an addict. He had alcohol issues in the past too and I\u2019m not sure I can handle it.

This isn\u2019t a single incident with an objective person who\u2019s right and wrong, this is an entire relationship, a betrayal, a compulsion, dysfunctional relational dynamics, the whole nine yards.

If he is saying your relationship can save him, he's either deliberately being manipulative or he's an idiot.\n\nThe \"you need to change the way you speak to me\" is typical controlling behavior. If you raise an issue about a relationship with someone, and every time it gets turned into, \"you need to apologize to me because\", then it is an abusive controlling dynamic. Don't let go of what you need to talk about - his alcohol addiction and his newly revealed gambling addiction. He's clearly going to try to shift the focus onto anything else, because that is what addicts do. If he can't talk about it and accept that he has a problem, and he needs help, then he's going to remain an addict for some time to come.\n\nI suggest you accept that the relationship is over. You will need more than just his declaration that he is \"better\" to go back.", "NTA.\n\nMy heart aches for you. I'm the widow of an alcoholic, and even though he was sober from alcohol for most of our 27y marriage, his behavior as an addict was a constant problem between us.  He would steal my medication and then gaslight me about it. When I caught him with my meds, he made me feel like it was my fault. I was going crazy, wondering if he was right and somehow I was to blame, because in most other areas he was a great father and husband. \n\n Our house was repossessed because he wasn't paying the mortgage and didn't tell me. To this day I have no idea where that money went. \n\nEven though we both made ok salaries and lived modestly with little or no debt, he was constantly mooching off of his parents for things like preschool tuition, winter coats, DVDs, video games. And every time his extended family wanted to all go out to eat, he would get his parents to pay for our family's meals.  \n\nThat mooching caused major problems with my relationship with my in-laws. I have no idea what he was saying to his family, but they have always blamed me for the constant mooching. I would beg him not to ask his family to pay our expenses, and he would remind me of our marital agreement that he would handle matters with his family and I would handle matters with my family. So I would butt out. When he died during the pandemic, his family all cut off me and our kids the day of the funeral.  We still don't know precisely why. But I can guess.\n\n*My point is: partnering with an addict has major repercussions in ways you could never predict.*  I loved my husband. But if I had known some of the things he did, I would've insisted on ongoing therapy throughout our marriage before agreeing to marry him.\n\n*Your bf is trying to change the narrative to make his major problems be your fault.*  There is absolutely no way that anyone could confront him with his lies in a way that he would like. You are not to blame.\n\nDo you really want to be with someone whose default is to never accept blame fully, without saying, \"I'm sorry,  but you...[fill in the blank with whatever made-up fault of yours he would say lessened his responsibility].\" He may constantly try to guilt trip and manipulate you, and blame you to your face and behind your back anytime he gets caught by someone while he's facing the natural repercussions of his addiction.  Do you want to change all of your life goals so that you can pay for the consequences of his actions alongside him? Do you want to spend your life perpetually wondering if he's lying to you?\n\nIf you keep financially supporting him, all you are doing is helping him escape consequences that might otherwise cause him to break this cycle. He must \u2014 on his own \u2014 make the extremely difficult commitment to beat his addiction. And then to actively, consistently, eternally get up each morning and decide not to give in each time he is tempted, all throughout the day, like it's his own version of Groundhog Day.\n\nDon't let him make this about you. Call his bluff and stick to your guns. He needs to conquer this addiction on his own. You can't do it for him.  If he conquers the addiction for a few years, then \"maybe*, with ongoing therapy, you could make an informed decision to date again. Or maybe you'll find that you prefer a partner who will walk by your side as an equal rather than expecting you to carry them. \n\nSo very sorry for the long response. Good luck.\n\nETA:  It is not your responsibility to make him a better person. It's his job to do all of the hard work necessary to Make Himself a better man, for himself.", "NTA RUN this guy will only keep dragging you down. He wasted 6 years of your life with his lies. Don\u2019t give him one more minute", "NTA.  He exploded because he had to confront his addictions, which is a common event for people struggling with these issues.  I would put some major breaks on this relationship until he gets help to deal with his issues.\n\nIf you both decide to stick together, jumping into major financial investments like a house or marriage should be put on hold.  He's throwing major abuser vibes with his bit about how is outburst was all OP's fault.  Figuring out where the addict ends and the abusive AH begins is something OP needs to find out if they really want to stick with this dude.", "NTA. Save yourself and end the relationship.

He's a) trying to guilt trip you into staying with him and b) telling you that you are the one who has to change, not him, like your response to his addiction is a bigger problem than his addiction and c) trying to make you responsible for dealing with his problems. Do you want the weight of his addiction on your shoulders for the rest of your life?", "NTA he's an abusive addict.", "NTA. He's angry with YOU?

His snippiness. Blaming you for starting arguments and how you talk to him. Blaming you for being manipulative for making an innocent comment about the sunroom.  Emotional abuse by saying he will be single forever without you - this is him saying his happiness is *only* dependent on you.  \n\nI have been happy and unhappy over the years and one thing I have learned in my singleton times is that a person has to be happy and content in their lives and love themselves **before** they can find happiness, contentment and love in a relationship.  Being in a relationship is the *icing on the cake* of an already happy and contented life, finding love outside of yourself is a bonus of life and can't be found without inner love", "NTA you have to figure out if you want to deal with an addict for the rest of your life", "No, trust can't be rebuilt. Go to Al-Anon or gambler-anon, break up and start your life. NTA", "NTA. Your fiance is not going to magically change. He needs to choose that, and stay on that path for himself.

He sounds like a manipulative asshole. Go find someone better.", "Run far and run fast! NTA just get away from him. He's traded one addiction for another.  And he treats you badly because of his addiction.  You won't be able to fix him! You won't have a good life with him.", "NTA.

And you 2 may not be compatible.", "I said the thing about being single forever and got married a year after she left me. Just words", "NTA. Marrying this man will be the biggest mistake of your life.", "addicts while in the middle of addiction will constantly lie. personally, i would never be able to trust him until he's gotten proof of being clean/stable for a long time, and i would never marry him until i am certain there are no and will be no surprise debts i suddenly have to pay 50% of. you can love someone and not trust them, and honestly you should be giving this to a counselor of some kind, not reddit.\n\ngood luck", "Nta. You'd be doing yourself a favor by not getting married to this man. Find someone who you can actually trust, and who won't ruin your life with addiction.", "NTA. Your fiance is manipulative. He's a liar. He's a gambling addict. He insulted you when you confronted him on his lies. Do not ever merge your finances with his. He will gamble all your money away. He says all this crap to you to make you feel guilty and get you to stay but he didn't say he would stop gambling. He didn't apologize for lying or insulting you. Do not marry him. You will never be financially stable as long as you're with him.", "I was together with gambling addict and his money problems and no will to go rehab broke us apart. From something serious as gambling you need atleast one year worth of time without gambling before you can start to even think to trust the other person again. Also your fianc\u00e9's way to blame you is normal to addicts who can't see that the problems is them not you. It is always easier to blame other one and escape to bad habits.", "NTA- That sounds like he's projecting all of his fears about gambling on to you and problems with you.\n\nYour life would not be perfect if your voice changed and you spoken a different tone.  Your life would be different if he didn't gamble away all of his money.\n\nHe's trying to make this not about losing all of his money on gambling and trying to make this all your fault somehow.\n\nBut he can't do that.\n\nYou know you do not have a future with him. You know that right?\n\nIf you get married, you'll be tying down your financial information to his.", "My sister is a counsellor working with gambling addicts. What I\u2019ve learned from her is that you should not tie yourself to him. Once you\u2019re married, his debts will become your debts and he can bury you in a financial hope it could take you years to get out of. \n\nIf he\u2019s admitted he\u2019s an addict then he needs to be seeking help. This is a journey you can take for him or with him. He needs to make the changes himself. OP, move on and find someone who can meet you at your level and has the same goals as you. This man has a lot of work to do on himself before he\u2019ll be ready for that.", "I always look for comments like these in such serious situations - you're 100% correct", "\"I'm a gambling addict, but if you don't do exactly as I say, I'll get worse and it will all be your fault.\"\n\nHis actions are his responsibility and his alone. OP can't change him, he can only change himself.\n\nOP, he's already betrayed you and screwed up your future. He's shown you who he is - are you paying attention?", "The question you need to ask is - he said he will always be an addict. This is true, but it does not mean he will always gamble. Is he intending to give it up and seek help? Because if he had no intention of stopping I would say get off the train before it crashes, because it may not be straight away, but it will crash eventually. \n\nIf he accepts he needs help and wants to change, he has a lot to do to show you he is worthy of your trust, and working through this process of stopping will give you the milestones that you need to decide whether the relationship is rebuildable. A good start would be therapy and GA meetings. \n\nAlso a red flag for me is the \u2018if you can change how you speak he\u2019d be with you\u2019. You need to address that. The issue is not how you speak, it\u2019s his gambling addiction. Do not let him victimise himself and make you out as the bad guy here, this is what makes me worry he\u2019s not going to change."]}
