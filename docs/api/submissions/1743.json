Why spend gifts on an adult when they clearly don't appreciate it?\n\nIf it were me, I would still get her something because she is your step daughter and your husband's daughter, and I can imagine getting her nothing would cause tension or strain that isn't needed in your relationship, but I would absolutely not spend that much money on it.

If she's only showing up for the presents, then a cheap gift for a year or two will probably prevent her from even bothering to show up. I think going from one extreme to another is a horrible way to handle the situation, personally.", "Soft ESH. I think there is a lot of middle ground between 1k and nothing.

Do not plan to exchange gifts with her.\n\nExpecting her to show up with a lovely, thoughtful gift - or ANY gift for that matter - is futile at this point since you\u2019ve replied to others that you\u2019ve addressed this with her multiple times. Set a rule that you can live with regardless of if she still shows up empty handed.\n\nETA in my family, when you turn 21 you stop receiving gifts from all aunts/uncles/grandparents, and you start participating in secret Santa that is themed on a 3 year rotation: something that you make (DIY gifts), something that you bake (homemade treats), and something that they\u2019ll hate (gag gift).

To top it off she\u2019s not even appreciative. \n\nYour husband may have created this problem by going overboard but you allowed it too. You may not have raised her but you went along. I don\u2019t think you wanting to not get her anything is wrong. It\u2019s actually about time.  She\u2019s 24 now and time her naughty behavior stop being rewarded. \n\nI would let her know that going forward Christmas will look different.

When my step kids (who lived with us full time) didn\u2019t acknowledge either their Dad or I at Christmas, I sat them down and let them know how we felt.  Every year the kids went to visit their bio-mom at Christmas\u2026never a gift or a card for either one of us, and some years they didn\u2019t even bother to call and wish us a happy holiday. whether we celebrated at our house before or after Christmas, they seemed to have this esoteric conversation amongst themselves about their Mom and how much they love her\u2014meanwhile this was our Christmas with them And we felt ignored and unappreciated.  I told them how much this hurt their Dad (I didn\u2019t even bring up my feelings)\u2014especially after we spend a lot of time and effort curating gifts we knew they would love.  Despite being young adults at that point, they had no idea they had even been overlooking us.  Christmas has been wonderful since then.", "ESH but you and your husband less so. Stop all OTT gifts. She gets one gift under $100 for each gift giving occasion or you do the charity \u201cthis is in your name\u201d gift. \nBe prepared for backlash and an escalation of her behaviour. \nIf she complains about that level of gift giving, then she gets nothing.\nYou\u2019re a cash cow to her.", "YWBTA.  Yeah, she is an A H, but that doesnt mean you should be one too.  Purposefully not getting her a gift is just asking for her not to show up at all, and intentionally stirring things up within the family in an immature way.  I am guessing that her dad and siblings do not want to intentionally ice her out of your holiday festivities. \n\nMaybe get her a smaller, less-expensive gift next time, and talk to her about spending more time or expressing her gratitude to her father.", "YTA. Because - you are not using your big-person words and are instead passively-aggressively trying to send her a message. This will only accomplish her getting upset. THEN, you will still have to explain yourself, and by then the message you tried to send her will be soured.\n\nMy advice would be to first talk to her in some capacity. Either tell her the truth, how you're both hurt that she only shows up to collect her booty and makes you guys feel used. OR, tell her you guys aren't doing gifts this year for whatever reason (you feel it's too materialistic, you want to do a gift-free holiday just one year, etc.) and see how she's reacts.", "ESH for not talking about this like adults and for letting it go this long.\n\nYour husband should be the one addressing it.

Maybe you should just tell her you aren't doing Christmas anymore, and since she has never thanked either of you for gifts, you've decided to skip giving them all together.  Or better yet, give her one of those \"a tree has been planted in your name\" or \"a charitable contribution has been made in your name\".  Tell her you both decided gifts should be given to appreciative recipients.  \n\nAlso, change the locks on your house and don't give her a key.  Then find a hotel with a nice Christmas brunch and leave the house.  When she calls, send it to voicemail.", "NTA", "NTA. Tell her the new tradition is pajamas and no gifts. Ask her if she wants to be included. You and your hubby can exchange gifts alone.", "ESH. She was raised that way. By the man you\u2019re married to.", "NTA. From the moment it became obvious she's a gold digger type, I'd have just a nice post card for her every xmas wrapped into a nice paper :) With something sweet like \"Love you, merry xmas!\" in there.\n\nHere it is - a sign of attention worth exactly the amount of attention received. Or something nonsensical 'throw-away-gift' that people who dont really know each other exchange. She's acting like a stranger anyway, so she gets a stranger treatment.", "NTA BUTTTT. \nDude have you communicated these feelings to her or are you just ranting on reddit but never bothered to mention these issues to her? It might be nice to have a conversation rather than expecting her to read your mind. \n\nIs she the greatest giftgiver? No. But maybe she thinks you don\u2019t care since you never bring it up or discuss what you were hoping for as a gift. Give her a hint! The bf probably did and he got what he asked for while you got zilch. \n\nI will never understand people who are presumably in their 40s bashing a 24 yo for doing something they don\u2019t like while also having the communication skills of pubescent tweens.", "NTA. I am nearly 50 years old and still send my mother a thank you card every year because I want her to know I appreciate her and her efforts. She doesn't expect them, but I know they make her happy. I was raised to be grateful and appreciative. Why hasn't your husband talked to her?", "NTA \u2014 It seems like father needs to explain to daughter that she isn\u2019t a child anymore. That as an adult she\u2019s expected to show up for Christmas with thoughtful gifts for everyone. Most people are broke at 24. My family got lots of paperbacks when I was in my early 20s, but they were well considered paperbacks.", "Talk to the kid about this situation about what you have noticed. I'm going to say esh because it doesn't sound like this concern has been communicated yet", "NTA\n\nHer behaviour is extremely entitled and I think you should get her exactly what she's been getting your all these years: absolutely fuck all.", "This is the most gracious way to possibly handle this. Dear Abby level. Leaves no room for her to complain without being obviously entitled, you spend the same amount of money but actually do something good with it (and honestly take the tax write off, you deserve it!)", "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund\n[The Human Fund](https://festivusweb.com/festivus-the-human-fund.php)", "This would make a point, but it\u2019s also highly passive-aggressive and potentially alienating. If this were some random cousin, that would be one thing, but it\u2019s their daughter. Passive-aggressive gotchas IMO do not make for good parenting or stronger relationships. Wouldn\u2019t a best first step involve honest and straightforward communication?", "Funny advice from you when you're tasteless trash from the thrift shop.", "I know someone who did something similar. Only they got an empty iPhone box from someone and put the gift in the box before wrapping it up. Made a real impact \ud83d\ude02", "I used it to gift my dad and his (I think) third wife for their wedding. He and I had a tricky relationship, I had met her three times due to living in different countries and it was a very small wedding. I had no idea what to gift two almost strangers and figured it would be at least an icebreaker. Also I got outbid on a frog mariarchi band on Ebay\u2026\n\nIt was a spectacular gift. I had not realised until it was unwrapped to show the little toy goats that there was a 30 year age gap and it was taken as a dig at \u2018the old goat\u2019 remarrying. Dilemma: agree he\u2019s a dirty old man since the previous wedding was to a 22 year old while he was 50 or admit that due to her heavy smoking his new wife looked 30 years older?\n\nHer family had farming connections and her BIL is a sheep farmer and he got drunk and started slagging off goats as \u2018foreign\u2019 and \u2018too sleek, not enough wool.\u2019 The weirdest family fight ever.\n\nAnd then I ended up estranged from my dad because things went downhill from an already low bar. I had no idea that when they say the family who gets the goats writes to you to explain the change it makes, this carries on through the actual human grandkids and the goat grand-grand-grand-grand kids keep writing. It\u2019s been 17 years and still the goats keep in touch. I do not. \n\nThe charity actually once advertised for jobs for people to write the animal letters and as a writer I was going to apply but realised there was no way I could get through an interview without howling laughing at this accidental endless shade by goats and sound like an absolute hot mess. Instead I enjoy still supporting them with money and imagining my dad\u2019s rage at yet another goat update. Tbf he sends me Christmas cards reminding me that me being born ruined his life so goat chat rather goat shit is me being mature in return\u2026\n\nAnyone using Heifer International who would not like to be so petty, they do have timed package. I was on dial up so rushed my purchase and accidentally caused goat mayhem. I love the org but have to admit the goats are the most mature party involved in my case.\n\nI regret *nothing*. Especially my golden boy brother bullying me on the day to get in on the gift having not bothered and then getting totally blindsided by Goatgate and going mad that I duped him.", "Llama drama", "This is hilarious! I would love to write silly shit!", "I love this."]}
