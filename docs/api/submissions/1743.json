Why spend gifts on an adult when they clearly don't appreciate it?\n\nIf it were me, I would still get her something because she is your step daughter and your husband's daughter, and I can imagine getting her nothing would cause tension or strain that isn't needed in your relationship, but I would absolutely not spend that much money on it.

If she's only showing up for the presents, then a cheap gift for a year or two will probably prevent her from even bothering to show up. I think going from one extreme to another is a horrible way to handle the situation, personally.", "Soft ESH. I think there is a lot of middle ground between 1k and nothing.

Do not plan to exchange gifts with her.\n\nExpecting her to show up with a lovely, thoughtful gift - or ANY gift for that matter - is futile at this point since you\u2019ve replied to others that you\u2019ve addressed this with her multiple times. Set a rule that you can live with regardless of if she still shows up empty handed.\n\nETA in my family, when you turn 21 you stop receiving gifts from all aunts/uncles/grandparents, and you start participating in secret Santa that is themed on a 3 year rotation: something that you make (DIY gifts), something that you bake (homemade treats), and something that they\u2019ll hate (gag gift).

To top it off she\u2019s not even appreciative. \n\nYour husband may have created this problem by going overboard but you allowed it too. You may not have raised her but you went along. I don\u2019t think you wanting to not get her anything is wrong. It\u2019s actually about time.  She\u2019s 24 now and time her naughty behavior stop being rewarded. \n\nI would let her know that going forward Christmas will look different.

When my step kids (who lived with us full time) didn\u2019t acknowledge either their Dad or I at Christmas, I sat them down and let them know how we felt.  Every year the kids went to visit their bio-mom at Christmas\u2026never a gift or a card for either one of us, and some years they didn\u2019t even bother to call and wish us a happy holiday. whether we celebrated at our house before or after Christmas, they seemed to have this esoteric conversation amongst themselves about their Mom and how much they love her\u2014meanwhile this was our Christmas with them And we felt ignored and unappreciated.  I told them how much this hurt their Dad (I didn\u2019t even bring up my feelings)\u2014especially after we spend a lot of time and effort curating gifts we knew they would love.  Despite being young adults at that point, they had no idea they had even been overlooking us.  Christmas has been wonderful since then.", "ESH but you and your husband less so. Stop all OTT gifts. She gets one gift under $100 for each gift giving occasion or you do the charity \u201cthis is in your name\u201d gift. \nBe prepared for backlash and an escalation of her behaviour. \nIf she complains about that level of gift giving, then she gets nothing.\nYou\u2019re a cash cow to her.", "YWBTA.  Yeah, she is an A H, but that doesnt mean you should be one too.  Purposefully not getting her a gift is just asking for her not to show up at all, and intentionally stirring things up within the family in an immature way.  I am guessing that her dad and siblings do not want to intentionally ice her out of your holiday festivities. \n\nMaybe get her a smaller, less-expensive gift next time, and talk to her about spending more time or expressing her gratitude to her father.", "YTA. Because - you are not using your big-person words and are instead passively-aggressively trying to send her a message. This will only accomplish her getting upset. THEN, you will still have to explain yourself, and by then the message you tried to send her will be soured.\n\nMy advice would be to first talk to her in some capacity. Either tell her the truth, how you're both hurt that she only shows up to collect her booty and makes you guys feel used. OR, tell her you guys aren't doing gifts this year for whatever reason (you feel it's too materialistic, you want to do a gift-free holiday just one year, etc.) and see how she's reacts.", "ESH for not talking about this like adults and for letting it go this long.\n\nYour husband should be the one addressing it.

Maybe spend $100 instead of $500-1000?", "You would NBTA, as long as your Husband is the one who does this.  It's his daughter, he's partially the reason she acts this way, because he's allowed it.  He has to be the one to stop this behavior.  She's an adult, she should really know better by now anyway.", "NTA but you should have a conversation with her and let her know the change in plans.  Communication is key in relationships.", "NTA- You're under no obligation to donate, but I promise you there are tons of families this who would appreciate even a meal.\n\nNot saying you should stop giving her gifts, but truthfully with that attitude and behavior for years, I'd rather make a donation in her name to someone that appreciates it.", "NTA", "Get her something useful but inexpensive like socks or slippers.", "Why don\u2019t y\u2019all start a new Christmas tradition and go on a trip? That way y\u2019all can explore and experience new places and don\u2019t have to deal with her being inconsiderate. It would be fun to pick somewhere new each year.", "NTA but don't be petty like that. Just come out and tell her you aren't getting her anything. Do it before she comes to the house. My guess is she won't show up and you will have a drama-free Christmas morning.\n\nIf she does freak out and go NC, you got your present right there!", "NTA - but there seems like a better option to try before yours\u2026why don\u2019t you just talk to her and tell her your issue?", "NTA but tell her you\u2019re not exchanging gifts this year. Ten bucks days she won\u2019t show up.", "I would stop with the gifts but I would say something before, like we've decided to donate to charity instead of doing gifts this year. You can adopt a family for the holidays at lots of local orgs. If she knows no gifts are in store for her she probably won't show up.\n\nI stopped birthday gifts after 18. For Christmas I used to send the adult skids pajamas, socks, candy, homemade cookies, and a nice check. They barely acknowledged it, so now I just send a check. Less work for me and it's what they really want anyway. Our son will be home from college and will have a few small things to open but mainly cash.", "NTA. She is an adult so she shouldnt be expecting gifts and should also know not to be so ungrateful. You arent obligated to gift her anything.", "Start by scaling way back this year for both her birthday and Xmas. One gift and $20 in a card. Next year, one gift. See how she responds", "I don't see anywhere in your post that she demands expensive presents, or that you talked to her about your issues, or what your husband thinks.  \nI may be projecting my culture, but in my country most young people spend several hours with parents on Christmas to honor tradition and give some affection, then fuck off to a real party with their peers.  \nHer father basically started new family with you when she was almost adult.  \nMaybe she just doesn't want to intrude to your family celebration, but still fulfills smth that connects her as a child to her father, like tearing into presents.  \nMaybe try buying her 20 dollar plushie and she'll still be happy.", "I would honestly plan a trip for the 2 of you and let her know that you are doing something different this year.   I would give her a gift in the $50 to $100 range and have her father talk to her about her behavior.", "NAH I get the impulse to be petty, but it\u2019s her dad that set these expectations. It\u2019s he who should have a discussion with her about how Christmas will look going forward", "Give her a Kiva gift certificate & stocking stuffers. Kiva does microloans. Kiva is the bomb.

She\u2019s 24 now so it\u2019s time she learned there is no Santa.", "YTA - why bc you\u2019re teaching her this is okay. How about you and the husband communicate with her. If she still doesn\u2019t get it then  sure. But don\u2019t do that as your first method of action imo.", "Hmmm ... I have typed and started over a few times. My immediate family has more than they will ever need. So every year for Christmas I would support a charity in the family name as a present to all from  my Mom and I. It made Mom very happy.", "\"A Donation Has Been Made in Your Name to the Human Fund Card...Money for People\"", "Just to clarify, the gift exchange and dinner is just her dad and I. Neither of us have family near by. So ot was us giving her gifts and doing our exchange, and her just opening presents. Then her dad and I watch movies and make dinner. \n\nIt would only be the 3 of us", "Oh, she has litterally told us what she wants, which tent to be expensive gifts. \n\nOne year I gave her a fitbit and she litterally Google it, told me how much is costed, and than gave it away because she wanted a better one.", "Its not our first method. He has talked to her every year", "My 12 Year old nephew decided on his own that one way gifting was not done anymore. His gifts are cheap but ridiculously well thought through. He may be a bit precocious, but by the time you leave high school you should be aware", "I think this is a valid point. If dad has set this up to be her normal expectation of the holiday it\u2019s an ESH for me.", "She\u2019s a 24yr old adult.

One of the best days EVER.", "Has he ever spoken to her about this?", "If he is down for it then definitely don't get the entitled princess anything. If she asks \"where's my gift?\" You can respond with \"where's our card?\"", "You should tell her the plan in advance and see if she shows up, knowing that there won't be a gift. That tells you everything you need to know. If she gets upset, ask her why she expects gifts given to her, but she doesn't reciprocate.  NTA"]}
