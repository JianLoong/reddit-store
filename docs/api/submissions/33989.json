{"id": 33989, "submission_id": "18tola9", "title": "WIBTA for calling out a colleague for taking a box of shared Christmas treats home for himself?", "selftext": "For background: I am a full time employee at a well known online retailer. The employees at my site range from warehouse workers up to senior leadership. We also work with external vendors/contractors, who are in our building daily. \n\nWe have seen an increase in employee thefts within the building (nearly all of these thefts involve the warehouse workers). Usually it's taking from another worker (food, jackets, headphones, etc.) or it can involve taking from the company's assets (food/drinks from our vending area, company swag, etc.). I work in HR, so it's my job to investigate these incidents with our security team, and take disciplinary action, as warranted.\n\nThat said: one of our contractors brought a giant box of chocolate Christmas candies (something like 5 lbs.) into the office for the employees to share. Said contractor approached many of us to let us know that they brought the candy in, where they left it, and to help ourselves. \n\nI went over to the location where the contractor left the box, and it wasn't there. I started asking around, and no one else had seen it.\n\nAfter asking everyone in the office, my next step was to consider that, perhaps, a warehouse worker had taken the candy. This isn't only an issue of taking the candy, but would also imply that a warehouse worker entered a restricted area that contains sensitive data, a terminable offense.\n\nI got with our security team to review camera footage to determine if we could pin down where this candy went, and who may have gained access to the office.\n\nWe found out the culprit: it was the most senior leader of the building, who makes more than twice what I do, and 5x as much as most of our employees. Not only did this person walk out with the box, they made an effort to conceal it in their backpack.\n\nWhen approached, they said they, \"took the box home to split the candy up into individual baggies to hand out to the employees.\"\n\nSo, wait, you took a gift from someone else, and decided you were going to regift it? Doesn't even make sense, and was an obvious lie.\n\nThey took it and thought no one would notice, and morale in the office has kind of been affected, because who does that? It's not because they took candy, but because they took the gift of a much lower-paid contractor before it could be shared with anyone else, and then lied about it.\n\nThe other employees in our office are pissed at the sense of entitlement and disrespect, but are largely urging me to let it go, especially since this person is more senior.\n\nI disagree - I think this person needs to know that their selfish action affected a lot of people, is unbecoming of a leader, and took time out of our day to \"investigate.\"\n\nI'm not trying to get them fired, or even receive some type of official discipline, but I want them to know that we all know they took it, and that they're setting a bad example. \n\nWIBTA?\n\nTL;DR\nSenior leader took office Christmas gift home, then lied about it. I want to confront them, but coworkers think I should let it go.", "created_utc": 1703860835, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tola9/wibta_for_calling_out_a_colleague_for_taking_a/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The greedy entitled glutton high ranking thief needs to be called out.", "YWNBTAH Hiwever, it\u2019s not smart to keep pursuing this. This person has already been approached so they know they\u2019ve been \u201cfound out\u201d already. They are very likely embarrassed and they must guess  that word got out and everyone knows it was them, and that no one believes their lies.  \n\nYou can\u2019t further punish someone above you and I don\u2019t see what\u2019s to gain by pursuing this.", "NTA. And frankly, I think he should be fired.", "INFO: \n\nDid they in fact bring baggies of candy back for everyone? \n\nI completely understand your righteous indignation and I do believe the same rules should apply to everyone.\n\nBut there are three things to consider: Did this high-ranking employee understand he won\u2019t be able to do this again without getting caught? If so, the problem is solved for the future without further action.\n\nSecond, is this person in a position to hurt you or make your job more difficult? This is always a consideration when considering a range of options.\n\nThird, what does your supervisor say? When in doubt get input from above.\n\nA subtler way to handle it would be to have the thief in for done counseling to let them know that while they meant well, with all the recent thefts going on, this seemed like just another theft, hurt morale, and put them \u201cunfairly\u201d under suspicion as responsible for the other thefts, and that the better thing would have been to leave the vendor gift there for people to help themselves to as customary. You have to find that fine line of just a hint for unctuousness so they are left wondering if you know they were lying but also letting them know that if they do it again there will be consequences and their reputation will be ruined in addition.", "Fair or not, reprimanding senior leaders is a sticky and messy  issue.

Also it\u2019s good that it was a high ranking so you realise that it\u2019s not only the lowly warehouse workers that might steal stuff.", "YWNBTA but surely you have a policy that covers this type of thing of theft from colleagues, accepting gifts, how they are shared, where they are put so that they are available to everyone etc. this is HRs job so it really should exist already (especially as colleagues have had their own stuff get stolen). \nIf you work with trade unions they can assist you with their input on policies of this nature because, clearly, there is concern about other stuff being taken and obviously some unconscious bias about it being warehouse workers that do all the bad behaviour...! \nSounds like there needs to be a culture shift at your workplace", "NTA.  If he accessed a sensitive area that he didn't have permission to be in, this seems pretty cut and dried.  I would run this by your manager because if you don't follow policy, it will come back on you.", "I'd ot only report them, but I'd also tell the person who brought it in.

The final straw for me was the holiday season of 2016. \n\nThe luncheon was a catered event. Also employees were given money to buy dishes from their favorite restaurants as well. \n\nAn employee stole an entire tray of meat that was warming up in a conference room. Nurses, doctors and other employees from different departments kept getting in line for food (I work in a medical facility). The supervisor in charge of the event kept pushing back the start of the event because he was waiting for his dry-ass roast to show up.

Not only that, they need to be disciplined for it. Are you going to accept theft just because the thief is a well-paid senior employee? That is kind of an AH move on your part. I wouldn't really do a whole lot to protect this persons job either. Who knows who they are going to steal from the next time, or who they've stolen from in the past?

Yes, there could be repercussions from management if you pursue this further ... but you are already seeing repercussions in employee morale and the level of trust that the rest of the employees have in the HR process (I wouldn't feel comfortable reporting a manager for sexual harassment, for example, if I knew that the HR team did nothing when they had concrete evidence of a manager stealing a gift while they're firing warehouse workers over lower-value thefts).", "Well, did they bring the candies back, divied up in individual bags for the whole works site?
