My girlfriend is triggered I want to take her to Japan.", "selftext": "Just to paint the picture I was engaged to a Japanese girl over 6 years ago. I traveled for work at the time and had met her while over there. \n\nThings ended up not working out and we split and we don\u2019t talk anymore. I believe she lives in LA and is happily remarried now. (I\u2019m genuinely happy for her and her husband.)\n\nHowever, having spent a considerable amount of time bouncing back and forth between Tokyo & the states throughout the duration of that relationship (5 years) I really grew to love the city and culture. Yes. I grew up being a\nnerd but I don\u2019t care about any of that, just more the city itself. I\u2019d learnt a good amount of the language while being there and had plans to return and travel to Osaka prior to the COVID shutting everything down. Full transparency, when it did shut everything down. I took two online courses just for fun to keep improving during the pandemic. If you don\u2019t use it, you lost it being my thought. \n\nFast forward to the present, I\u2019ve been happily dating someone going on 2 years and for the most part it\u2019s been great. We just moved in together and she\u2019s genuinely a wonderful partner. I consider myself really lucky but there\u2019s just one thing that\u2019s been a repeated point of contention.. \n\nShe\u2019s completely triggered (yelling type of angry) anytime Japan is mentioned. Whether it\u2019s a food vlog, lofi, car spec, etc it\u2019ll typically turn into her throwing a bunch of accusations about how I\u2019m fucking obsessed and starts bringing up my ex. \n\nHaving spent years learning the language, I really try to be respectful to my girlfriend\u2019s insecurities and I just do maybe 10-15min a day (not even) with a DuoLingo like app. It\u2019ll always be in the other room and with headphones. \n\nLast week, I found out I have to go back over to Osaka for work and will have a week afterwards to stay on holiday if I wanted. My initial reaction was excitement and offered to buy her a ticket to come join. She\u2019s been receptive to the idea but it feels like a time bomb.. \n\nIn case it needs to be said, Tokyo is MASSIVE. Osaka is like going to Chicago having dated someone in NYC. One person does not define an entire country. If this was NYC would you not want to go because I lived there years ago and dated someone?\n\nI\u2019ve tried being emphatic explaining how I\u2019d love to bring her there and make new memories but she says I\u2019ll just be thinking of my ex and that she hates the fact I\u2019ve already been there.\n\nI just want to go eat good food with her and have a great vacation with her.

It's not about the person you met there. \n\nShe very obviously has a lot of personal insecurities to work through. What it comes down to, are you willing to be her emotional punching bag, missing out on something you may not get to do again in your lifetime? Or is it best to part ways and be able to enjoy yourself in Osaka without the anxiety of her blowing up at you for no reason? \n\nRegardless of what you choose, she is going to likely need a mental health professional to help work through these insecurities, and it may take you walking away for her to acknowledge these issues for herself.", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend needs therapy. Anyone who is triggered by the mere existence of Japan is not thinking clearly. You have been together for TWO YEARS and she is still this insecure about your ex. That's a bad sign.", "Why do these posts start off so flowery? I love her so much I am so lucky but this one thing they do that is completely UNHINGED. Why doesn\u2019t she get some help because that\u2019s way too much insecurity. You live together and you want to bring her to Japan! She got you!

My stepfather was in the Navy many years ago, from another country. They used to go to Hawaii a lot. Of course they got it to mischief over there but he loved the experience of Hawaii.  He married my mum in 1982. He would talk about his desire to go back to Hawaii and my mother would do exactly the same thing as your gf and accused him of bring obsessed with the women he no doubt met over there. He really wanted her to experience Hawaii. \n\nHe never got to go back there. He's in his 80s now and literally a week and a half ago, he was hearing about my adventures which he loves, and fondly talking about male locals he met in Hawaii, and how hospitable the people were and was very bitter about what mum did. \n\nI know your gf. You need to decide how much you're willing to sacrifice to be with her. I can assure you, she is unhinged.", "NTA. What, are you supposed to avoid the entire country for as long as you two are together? How ridiculous", "Your girl is insecure. You need to consider 5 years from now; when you\u2019re married & have 3 kids-can you handle her STILL getting this riled up?", "NTA...she needs to conquer her insecurities. Hopefully she takes this chance. This will likely be a defining moment in your relationship.", "NTA, she really needs to address her insecurities with a professional. So right now, she is inclined to join (but you just fear another crisis)?", "NTA but you need to reconsider the relationship. She is so jealous that she is upset that you like a country and a culture. I agree with the other commenter who said you probably chatted about your ex a lot, but this isn't really your fault. Those is a serious character flaw. \nDo you want to be 50 and remembering when you used to visit Japan and speak Japanese, but your gf made you stop because she was jealous of your ex? Do you see how stupid that sounds?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBreak up. She is negatively impacting your life and your job with her unreasonable jealousy.", "If you're gf is \"triggered\" to the point of throwing tantrums, then you're NOT lucky. You're a babysitter to an immature woman.\nWe all have a past. We all have past relationships. The operative word being PAST. She, however cannot move on from yours. Either she deals with it and grows up or your relationship is doomed.\nNTA but your gf is a massive immature AH.", "NTA - your girlfriend, as people have already pointed out, might be struggling with some mental health issues which cause her to experience an unhealthy and unresonable amount of jealousy. Try directing her towards getting the help she needs. Good luck!", "Probably spoke too much about your ex and gave the wrong impression that the ex is still in the forefront of your mind. Or that you have some nostalgia longing for what was. Maybe that\u2019s on you? Or maybe you are in denial even.", "NTA \n\n>I really try to be respectful to my girlfriend's insecurities \n\nUmm why?", "YTA.

As long as you don't accidentally give off the impression that you're somehow hung up on her and/or fetishize Japanese women, she's got nothing to be so jealous of.

We actually got engaged out there on my first trip.

Maybe I'm oblivious or something, but I read half of these AITA relationship posts thinking, why would anyone stay with someone who behaves like this??
