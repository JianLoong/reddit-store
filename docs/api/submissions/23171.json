Cuz usually issues like this don't just resolve themselves. They get better for a bit then bad again and round and round the carousel you go.

You need to stop assuming you know how her ADHD affects her and work together as a couple to figure out a way to support her. ADHD cleaning hacks can be a game changer for many.

On the one hand, your girlfriend probably should be more considerate of the environment for the benefit of both of your mental well-being. Obviously, you both have different standards for living and cleaning the household, which should be addressed and boundaries set as well as expectations and division of chores, bills, etc.\n\nThough reading the post, however, it seems in my opinion that you are purely focusing on how things affected you and not really seeing from her perspective that she also struggles with her own neurological issues. Clearly, if she's not practicing healthier habits, he is having some sort of issue in her own way. You are expecting her to be accommodating to you, but what have you done to accommodate her. What percentage of chores do you do around the home?\n\nGive and take are important in a relationship as well as communication and compromise. I feel like it's time for you both to talk and see if you can find a way to tap into those qualities.\n\nSide note: I feel like the explanation of adhd to someone who you stated also has it is kind of obnoxious in a manspaining type of way.....", "NTA - if you've had conversations about this and it hasn't improved over time, it's never likely to consistently.by the sounds of it, home management and chores are fairly equally separated into tasks you each prefer.\n\nYes, I understand ND can make day-to-day life at home quite the challenge (especially if you have a taxing job that takes it out of you mentally or physically), but there are so many ways to gain support if some side effects of this are negatively impacting your spouse. \n\nFor instance: setting up direct debits so you're not paying bills late, setting yourself a 5 minute timer and just do what you can for 5 minutes (this one can be hard to get your head around, perfectionism can make it hard to start a task you know you can't finish right now), setting up a bin with a lid next to the bed etc", "Ok ha my partner sounds like you and I sound like your partner. That\u2019s a tad weird. But my executive disfunction is crazy. My partner however like you needs clean and tidy. I have doom piles. I am extremely aware my behaviours linked to my adhd affect his mental health. When my adhd is being over dramatic (meaning extreme executive disfunction combined with my ptsd I need to be a burrito) I communicate it with him. He helps me find a place to start. Something small. Like he will ask me to pick up my dirty clothes and throw them in the machine. He will hang them or put them in the dryer and fold them. One doom pile down. In exchange I work harder in the more public areas of the house to keep my doom piles out of sight. He knows when I\u2019m crashing coz the cleaning is the first thing to go. BUT we have an unspoken agreement. I will clean for both of us (he works more hours than me) but I will clean to a level I can cope with. Any thing extra he does. Ie he doesn\u2019t like crap accumulating on top of the fridge (I can be very blind to it) so he cleans it off once a month. It\u2019s rarely looked at as his mess vs my mess. It\u2019s our mess. Tissues were a learning curb I absolutely leave tissues random places. I\u2019m a work in progress but I\u2019m also aware of ny faults. Sounds like your gf likes to simply ignore how it makes you feel. Where as I\u2019m constantly trying to keep a balance as I\u2019d my partner. He lets little things go, I do a little extra when I can. We help each other", "Which part did I assume how her adhd effects her? (The adhd paralysis and sensory overload was regarding myself). She has cleaning apps, hacks, reminders, chalk board in the kitchen, a smart watch to help with reminders. Not sure what else I can do outside of these things. Suggestions definitely appreciated! I'd love to not nag anymore, although I do require a level of tidy and hygiene to function personally.", "We have discussed boundaries around cleaning, made a fair division of household chores and bills which accommodate jobs each of us prefers or has a dislike to. Example I hate laundry but am happy doing all of the gardening and floors. I'm not sure how I haven't been accommodating of they are split equally, and I generally do more of the organisational jobs like food shopping, bills, Pet care as she struggles with these.\n\nIt wasn't an explanation of adhd to her, it was how these things impact me. She doesn't deal with sensory overload much if at all, compared to me (auDHD) so I felt it best to make her aware of this and the paralysis. Also I'm not a man, so condescending if anything.", "I\u2019m not saying you are a bad person for nagging. I also called you NTA because i very much get the frustration you are in. I am saying it clearly isn\u2019t working. Which should be evident by the fact that you\u2019ve had to do it for three months. Nagging can actually trigger executive dysfunction. But, by all means keep doing what you are doing because it is clearly working so well.", "A piling system organization that can appear as clutter and usually is unique to the individual is often a common symptom of adulthood adhd. As I'm sure you know. As well as how the more pressure you put on someone to focus on any given task can and will, in most cases, be the cession to any productivity coming from the anxious individual and is therefor an ineffective way to motivate them.\n\nMaybe throughout time, you have learned better and more effective coping skills. However, it seems your gf is still struggling to find one's for herself. Maybe get together again and talk about how you both. As a team, you can find ways to motivate and teach each other. For example, do chores at the same time every day together make it fun and rewarding as well as a bonding time.", "I asked for suggestions, which you didnt offer, so clearly I don't want to keep doing the same things as I'm fully aware it isn't working. You didn't clarify what part I assumed her adhd symptoms?", "Hire a cleaning service and stop fighting. That's the solution you are looking for.", "I\u2019ll admit I misinterpreted your \u201cI understand she has ADHD as do I\u201d which did come off as you assuming that because you both have it you understand exactly what she suffers with.

But, the nagging isn\u2019t working and you both need to work on other ways to help you both thrive.

And being in a relationship with a person who wasn\u2019t there yet was extremely exhausting for both of us), the book gives insight from both their perspective and sometimes I\u2019d find a chapter where I\u2019m more like a wife, another one I\u2019d feel more organised hence more understanding of the husband. And it gives you the answers. It\u2019s obviously what works for them but it\u2019s an answer and even if not everything applies to you, at least you guys tried. Cause yeah, it\u2019s gonna take two for this to work.", "YTA - Because you keep nagging when you know full well that it's not working. It's quite ridiculous to keep doing something that annoys **the person you love most on this planet** when you already *know* it's not the method that works.", "NTA.\n\nI get how ADHD impacts these things (having it myself), but nagging won\u2019t help. \n\nI recommend you both sitting down and come up with a checklist system that works for both of you to manoeuvre these tasks so you\u2019re both comfortable. \n\nGetting used to a fixed schedule should help. And motivating each other.", "Tobacco in the bedroom?  Ew.\n\nLook, you can't change other people's behavior, only your own.  So you have to let her know that you can't live in filth, and you need her help to keep the place clean.  She can either make the effort, or she can tell you that she won't, through word or through deed.  If she won't, you can't make her.  All you can do is decide if it's enough of a problem that you need to step away from the relationship.", "NTA. I would be unwilling to live in an environment like this and have to treat my partner like a child. You need to decide what your dealbreakers in life are and act accordingly.", "NTA\n\nSure, with ADHD, things are going to be missed or ignored, but that's why you remind her.  At some point, she has to actually do what she needs to.   \n\nWe have a superintendent constantly whining how everybody is harassing him and telling him he doesn't do his job properly.  Dude, can't seem to understand if things got done properly, they wouldn't say it.", "You have too many animals for that small of a space. It\u2019s cruel to the animals to not keep the environment clean.

Full stop.\n\nIt was a word popularized in this context for pretty much the sole purpose of vilifying the person expecting chores to be done and excusing lazy partners.\n\nI am a woman with ADHD and I was like this as a teen and young adult. I would make excuse after excuse. Don\u2019t let her get away with it. She\u2019s not broken. If I didn\u2019t literally lose people and privileges in life because of my lazy ass behaviour, I never would have changed it. That\u2019s the bare truth of the matter.\n\nBluntly, my parents were chumps. They complained and begged me to change but they never followed through with any consequences so I never gave a shit. I knew I could get away with it. I thought they were being picky. \n\nI didn\u2019t do anything to change it until a boyfriend I really loved basically went \u201cfuck this, you\u2019re lazy\u201d and left me over it. \n\n> For example, down her side of the bed its covered with tobacco, dirty tissues, dirty clothes. \n\nThis is not you being picky, this is disgusting and unhygienic. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to live like an animal, don\u2019t live like one. Do yourself a favour and actually leave. If she\u2019s ever going to change, she\u2019ll change so you\u2019ll come back. Or at least she\u2019ll learn a lesson for the next person. If she doesn\u2019t change, she was never going to and you would have lived like that forever.", "Almost 4 years, and you are right, this has been an ongoing issue and the article another user shared kind of sums it up perfectly. I think ultimately we are incompatible if she can't hear me.", "This did give me a good laugh!!

I've recently followed them on Instagram and they're great. Plus the added benefit of a neurotypical perspective is interesting to get as well.", "The relational empathy sentence?", "Yes, I believe they took it to mean that you were making a logical leap.  \"She has ADHD, I have ADHD, therefore, we manifest ADHD the same way.\"\n\nBy the way, what you're calling 'relational empathy' can be a two-edged sword.  Unless you've actually asked her 'does your ADHD make executive functioning difficult?' and received an affirmative answer, deciding on her behalf that it does is contraindicated.  No matter what issues she has, it's still on her to manage and deal with them, and if she has other issues, assuming that it's what you think it is means the actual issue doesn't get addressed or accommodated or taken into account."]}
