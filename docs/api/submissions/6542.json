Her school, workplace etc are a few hours drive from here. I own an apartment around that area, so we're letting H stay there. I don't charge her any rent.\n\nMy sister (40) lost her job last year and works at a new place, which pays much lower. She lives with her boyfriend and my 14 yo niece, and they're struggling with the rent. They like extravagance so this is hard on an entire family.\n\nI want to offer the apartment to my sister's family to stay in, since they're 3 people who actually need it. They're onboard with this and we've talked to H, that obviously it won't be immediately and we'll give her some time to find another place, so my sister can stay there.\n\nH got upset and said if she really has to move, and it's going to be hard. I offered to help her find somewhere, but said that this is our decision. My wife isn't happy with this and said I'm being unfair to H.\n\nEdit: the extravagance comment doesn't mean they're not living within their means, obviously they've cut down now. Just wanted to clarify because telling me to just tell my sister to no be extravagant isn't really helpful when it's already been done.

Assuming that I take OP\u2019s edit at face value (they\u2019re no longer living extravagantly, so the statement was reflecting that they lived within their means, but could afford a decent lifestyle before their current hardship). \n\nOne one hand, you have a single mother, her 14 year old daughter and her boyfriend. I\u2019m filling some imaginary details to make my point. \n\nLet\u2019s say OP\u2019s sister made $100K/year, boyfriend made $20K/year and they comfortably lived in a home where they could afford their $3000 mortgage, their 2 cars, 3 cell phones, home cable and Internet, daughters activities, clothes, food, some dinners out, and 1 week of vacation and 2 weekends away/year. I think that would fit the bill of extravagance - Nice house with more bedrooms than they needed, daughter gets piano lessons and horseback riding lessons, they\u2019re able to afford decent clothes and shoes\u2026.your typical upper middle class existence. \n\nNow OP\u2019s sister loses her job, so they are hemmoraging money from their savings because they still have to pay the mortgage and they still have to buy clothes for niece when she grows out of/wears out her current clothing. They still have to pay their car loans, their car insurance, their cell phones, their cable/internet (locked into a contract), they still need to be able to afford lunch money for niece, and to pay for school field trips. They\u2019ve cut out all vacations, they don\u2019t buy clothing for themselves anymore, they almost never eat out - all extravagances have already been cut. For the first month or two they continue with horseback riding and piano lessons because they think they\u2019ll be back on their feet soon. \n\nBut then OP\u2019s sister is only able to get a job making $50K/year. It\u2019s pretty impossible to cut out $50K worth of \u201cextravagance\u201d immediately. So horseback and piano lessons stop. They cut out cable, but their savings have dwindled and they can\u2019t make up the difference. So now they have to sell their house, they both still need their cars to get to their jobs, so they can\u2019t sell the cars. There\u2019s only so much they can cut. They need to move into an apartment but rent prices are high and their credit has been damaged because they couldn\u2019t pay their medical bills and they paid the mortgage late a few times because they had no other option. \n\nOn the other side you have stepdaughter whose only expenses are food, clothing, internet and entertainment for herself. Her parents still pay her car insurance and she\u2019s still on their cell phone plan, so she has relatively low fixed monthly costs and her parents have been letting her live rent free in a 2 bedroom apartment. \n\nWouldn\u2019t it make more sense for stepdaughter to move into a shared apartment with roommates like most 22 year olds do? Or move him and live with her parents like many 22 year olds do? Yeah she\u2019s not going to love it, but she was getting an incredibly sweet deal at a very young age and she\u2019ll be fine.\n\nOP\u2019s sister is raising a 14 year old, not fucking cheap! She wants to be able to give her daughter a normal high school experience even if it\u2019s vastly different from their previous lifestyle. They want to make sure she can at least still go on the band trip and out to an occasional movie with friends. OP\u2019s sister still has to pay for her car and car insurance so she can get to work, and they still need to have cell phones. And the big one, they still need to be able to afford medical care. \n\nA single mom to a 14 year old has fuck ton more expenses than a 22 year old who is still primarily supported by her parents and could fairly easily move home or into a roommate situation like most 22 year olds. \n\nSo looking at income doesn\u2019t make any sense unless you\u2019re also looking at expenses and necessities. \n\nI say OP is NTA for wanting to help his single mother sister and his neice.

Additionally, you are forcing her to incur major expenses (security deposit, rent, utilities, renter\u2019s insurance, perhaps furniture for a new place if you own the apartment furnishings) with very little notice. This was also an arrangement that she probably considered unlikely to change for the duration of her gap year, so I doubt she has sufficient savings to cover these sudden new expenses. Unless you offered to subsidize your stepdaughter\u2019s move and its associated costs YTA.\n\nETA: she\u2019s also in the middle of a gap year\u2014 I doubt she\u2019ll find many places that will rent to her for less than a year.", "YTA.\n\nYou're breaking your word and failing to honor your commitment to your step-child, who has a single income, and can't be in school because of health problems.  If you were a man of your word,  you would't be doing this.\n\nNot only is your behavior dishonorable, it's breathtakingly rejecting of this young girl.\n\nLet the two extravagant adults with a work history and no health problems support themselves and their child.", "YTA absolutely think you\u2019re wrong for doing that.", "NTA. I don't understand why you made the comment about extravagance if they've stopped living that way. But since you've made the correction, this my vote. It's your house, you can do whatever you want. Your step daughter isn't in school, so she can work full time and find a roommate. Your sis has a child who is a minor and can't work.", "NTA she\u2019s 22 she chose to take a year off h knew she would lose her housing if u own the apt h is living in u have every right to ask her to leave it will make people mad but that\u2019s on them not you", "Nta", "NTA in my opinion, your sister is in need and your step daughter seems fit to fend for herself, it's your department so you can do with your property whatever you want. Your wife is just upset because it will cause some bother to her daughter but it's not like you're throwing her on the street without any help.", "NTA - they have a child and family and you have offered to help your step daughter find another place. Had you just kicked her out with no warning or help it would be a total YTA. \n\nEither way, it\u2019s unpleasant but I understand why your sister and her family take priority.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister, her husband and minor child need help. You ate in a position to help them\n\nYour step daughter is 20 and is no longer in school, for whatever reason, and is staying rent free in the apartment. \n\nOf course you should help your sister. You SD will either need to go back to school, pay her own rent or come home.", "NTA\nBecause it\u2019s your place and you can do whatever you want to do! TIU get to decide! Your sister and her situation takes precedence over a child w/o any real need or aspirations. \nIf H and her mother and or the entire family complains then they should pay for her a place to live or offer to put H up!", "NTA. You offered to help your adult stepdaughter find a place to live. Your sister and family need help. I get it, being 22 and not in college is hard but it\u2019s also time to move out and start your life. I would likely do the same if it involved my preteen niece being homeless. Your stepdaughter can find roommates.", "NTa\n\nKnown step-daughter for less than 10yrs, we know they been married for 5, but not how long they let. Step-daughter is 22, or sister who op known her entire life, has a daughter, his niece. easy choose", "**NTA**. The responses here are WILD. \n\nYou're under no obligation to give your ADULT step-daughter a free apartment. If you're choosing to use it to help your family, it's up to you to decide who needs it the most. And frankly, given that your sister and husband have a minor that they're taking care of? I would have chosen them too. \n\nYes, finding a place to live is hard. Welcome to the world of everyone who doesn't get a free apartment handed to them by their parents.", "It\u2019s your place do what you want either way you\u2019re helping someone and giving them a free place to live so absolute NTA I think you taking into account that your niece is a minor and needs the stability is very considerate and your step daughter is a full blown adult who can take care of herself.", "NTA\n\nTime for the stepdaughter to put on her big girl pants and stand on her own two feet.", "NTA \nMakes sense to me. \n\nLet the daughter live with you and your sister with family in the apartment.\n\nThe daughter is not yet finished with her education and need your help, but your own sister need the flat more, especially with a minor.", "NTA. You can\u2019t extend this exceptional generosity to everyone you love, so people are calling you an asshole? Whether you carry the practicality challenged sister and her family, or the dropout stepdaughter, you\u2019re still a nicer than average guy. Hell, rent the place to a paying tenant and give all the spoiled relatives a little temporary stipend. Some people will figure shit out when and only when they no longer have a choice.", "Nta. She's 22. She can support her own needs.", "NTA", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. There is a minor involved here, and the sister needs the place more than H. H can move back home until she goes back to college. Plus, it is OPs job lace and he can decide who he wants to live there.", "I thought NTA at first but immediately to YTA as soon as i read \n\n> They like extravagance so this is hard on an entire family.\n\n... thats your sisters family's problem then. Have fun being homeless as long as you have your rolex and luis vuitton", "The daughter came out of college because she's having health problems. We don't know if she can fend for herself right now.

They had an agreement that he broke out of the blue, plus he doesn't want to find out what her health problem is so it must be more or less serious.", "And get a cheaper place to rent somewhere else", "I agree. Every time I read a comment of his that includes info not in the original post, he just seems more like an AH.", "There's even better statement in that post:\n\n> but said that this is our decision.\n\nand then:\n\n> My wife isn't happy with this and said I'm being unfair to H.\n\nSo who is included in the \"our\" decision? Definitely not the wife nor step-daughter it seems.", "His step daughter can live at home with her parents or move in with roommates (as most 22 year olds do). Health problems don\u2019t entitle a 22 year old to live rent free in a 2 bedroom apartment by herself for an unspecified amount of time. \n\nSometimes circumstances change and the sweet deal you had goes away. It doesn\u2019t make OP a monster.", "She is his step-daughter, and in a lot of cases it's super inappropriate to call a step-daughter just your daughter, we see it on this sub constantly. Obviously there's issues here, but saying she's his step-daughter isn't making some big point or diminishing their relationship, someone being a \"step\" is not inherently denigrating them.", "You don't break an agreement with someone who has health issues, who is working to pay for their recovery and needs a place, let alone for two working adults who want an extravagant lifestyle, the OP himself admits they live extravagantly, they should learn to lower their lifestyle for the sake of the minor, not the OP who didn't consult anything with his wife.", "Little column A, little column B.", "Marrying a woman with a 17 year old child isn't agreeing to pay for their college and give them an apartment for free. Do you think she considers him her dad? I very much doubt it, and rightfully so since literally no 17 year olds would. I don't see where he told her he could have it for a whole year. He was already nice to let her stay there for free as long as he did. There is literally nothing wrong with him wanting to help his niece he's known her whole life, just because her parents are irresponsible doesn't mean he shouldn't help. Its absolutely insane to call him an extreme asshole here. Grow up.", "No one is saying he is obligated to give anyone an apartment for free. What they're saying is that he is an AH because he (1) offered the apartment on his own, (2) told H she could live in it for 1 year.\n\nHim reneging on his offer after she accepted it is what makes him TA.\n\nOther reasons OP TA:\nNot discussing with wife.\nGiving H an absurdly short amount of time to find other appropriate accommodations (he characterizes it as plenty but apparently it's 2-3 weeks - THAT IS NOT PLENTY).", "Not even petty. I feel like that's a reasonable compromise. If it was OP's bio daughter he'd probably suggest it.", "If you are petty (and I don't think you are), you are nowhere near as petty as OP."]}
