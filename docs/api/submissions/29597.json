My older sister (22) has been dating her boyfriend (21M) for three months now. He\u2019s been sleeping over at our apartment ever since they started dating, but the frequency of the sleepovers have been increasing over the past few weeks.\n\nOur apartment isn\u2019t tiny, but it\u2019s small enough that we all share a bathroom. The room doesn\u2019t have air conditioning and only has one window that doesn\u2019t really let a draft through. When you shower, the room steams up a ton, so my whole life we\u2019ve just either left the door ajar or opened the door fully as soon as we stepped out of the shower and did the rest of our bathroom stuff.\n\nThe very first time my sisters boyfriend slept over, I was getting ready to go to bed in the bathroom and had the door closed, but unlocked. I was taking off my boxershorts when he walked into the bathroom. He immediately apologized, closed the door and we never spoke about it again.\n\nWell, last week I thought I was home alone and was taking a shower in the afternoon with the door ajar, as always. After I was done, I opened the bathroom door and continued with my routine (lotion, face cream, stuff like that) and noticed that my sister had come home during my shower.\n\nWhen I was done, I walked into the kitchen to find my sister and her boyfriend having an argument. I didn\u2019t want to intrude, so I left and soon heard the front door fall closed. \n\nIn the evening I made dinner for our family and while I was cooking my other sister (20) came and talked to me. Apparently, our oldest sister and her boyfriend argument was about me and \u201emy\u201c showering habits. He thinks it\u2019s disgusting that I shower with the door ajar and feels uncomfortable with me using the bathroom in my own house.\n\nThis shocked me, because from the way our bathroom is set up, you can\u2019t even see the shower from outside of the door. I went to my other sister and asked her if this was true, and she refused to talk to me.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if I was the only one that showered like this. We all do. I\u2019m just the only one taking showers in the afternoon/evening when her boyfriend is usually there, because that\u2019s when I come home from hockey practice.\n\nSo, AITA for not completely closing the bathroom door while I shower?", "created_utc": 1698181326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fn94u/aita_for_not_closing_the_door_while_showering/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like your older sister handled her bf as appropriate and didn't involve you because it wasn't really any of your business at that point.\n\nAnyways, to the question you're asking us to judge, no you're NTA because as you said that's what your family has been doing your entire life. Your sister explained that to her bf, presumably, and moved on with her life without feeling the need to tattle to you about it (which is a quite mature response on her part). \n\nYTA for feeling the need to goto your sister after she had already handled her situation, and your other sister is also an asshole for spreading gossip and trying to create drama.\n\n\"What other people think of me is none of my business\"", "Nope your good his problem sounds like some closet case stuff that he\u2019s not comfortable with and should seek therapy for.

Showering with the door open when u know you live with other people seems disrespectful. Just close the door bro.", "YTA imo. It sounds like there are now 6 adults sharing one bathroom, which is bound to cause issues. But showering with the door open in an apartment with 6 adults is definitely weird. Maybe your family is used to it, but it is totally fair that someone else will be uncomfortable. Just close the door while you shower, then leave it open for the steam to clear once you\u2019re done.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
