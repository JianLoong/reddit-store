My older sister (22) has been dating her boyfriend (21M) for three months now. He\u2019s been sleeping over at our apartment ever since they started dating, but the frequency of the sleepovers have been increasing over the past few weeks.\n\nOur apartment isn\u2019t tiny, but it\u2019s small enough that we all share a bathroom. The room doesn\u2019t have air conditioning and only has one window that doesn\u2019t really let a draft through. When you shower, the room steams up a ton, so my whole life we\u2019ve just either left the door ajar or opened the door fully as soon as we stepped out of the shower and did the rest of our bathroom stuff.\n\nThe very first time my sisters boyfriend slept over, I was getting ready to go to bed in the bathroom and had the door closed, but unlocked. I was taking off my boxershorts when he walked into the bathroom. He immediately apologized, closed the door and we never spoke about it again.\n\nWell, last week I thought I was home alone and was taking a shower in the afternoon with the door ajar, as always. After I was done, I opened the bathroom door and continued with my routine (lotion, face cream, stuff like that) and noticed that my sister had come home during my shower.\n\nWhen I was done, I walked into the kitchen to find my sister and her boyfriend having an argument. I didn\u2019t want to intrude, so I left and soon heard the front door fall closed. \n\nIn the evening I made dinner for our family and while I was cooking my other sister (20) came and talked to me. Apparently, our oldest sister and her boyfriend argument was about me and \u201emy\u201c showering habits. He thinks it\u2019s disgusting that I shower with the door ajar and feels uncomfortable with me using the bathroom in my own house.\n\nThis shocked me, because from the way our bathroom is set up, you can\u2019t even see the shower from outside of the door. I went to my other sister and asked her if this was true, and she refused to talk to me.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if I was the only one that showered like this. We all do. I\u2019m just the only one taking showers in the afternoon/evening when her boyfriend is usually there, because that\u2019s when I come home from hockey practice.\n\nSo, AITA for not completely closing the bathroom door while I shower?", "created_utc": 1698181326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fn94u/aita_for_not_closing_the_door_while_showering/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
