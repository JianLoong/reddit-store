I've always been mildly uncomfortable with it just due to a variety of features about the whole thing. For starters the man is as young as I am and he basically now lives in my former room growing up. I don't say anything about it as its their life and they can live it as they like but, and I'll be completely honest here, all of it sort of discomforts me. Nevertheless, I have my own life and I still love them and I try not to think of that in any capacity. They are happy and that's good for them.\n\nWith that background out of the way. I am getting married soon and I wanted my parents to be there ofc. They were happy for me and it was great. Then my SO and I got to arranging everything for the wedding and we eventually began arranging the seating. I wanted to run my seating plan by my parents as they know some people better so I emailed it to them and asked them to look it over. They looked it over and then they called me that I had missed a seat for Dave (fake name for their significant other). I told them I didn't think Dave would be coming. They said they would be all coming and I said I'm not sure if its a good idea. I try to tip-toe to gently tell them to not bring Dave but they were insistent, so I was frank with them. I told them I was uncomfortable with Dave coming and I wanted to share my special day with them, not Dave. I tried to explain why I didn't think it was appropriate.\n\nAt this point, things took a turn for the worse. We had a back and forth which basically devolved into a fight. Eventually, they basically said they'd much rather just not come if they couldn't come as a couple. I, in a moment of anger, then said \"great, then don't come\" in a passive aggressive tone.\n\nI haven't talked to my parents since then. In a way I feel like they've changed so much from when I was young. I still love them and I still wanted them to come but all of this is just not how I imagined my wedding going. It's their life to live but this is my wedding. Its supposed to be about me and my SO surrounded by people we cherish. Dave and I have no relationship. He is a stranger to me and, respectfully, I genuinely am completely fine with that.\n\nI want them to come but if they want to bring Dave, I much rather they just don't. I love them but I don't want Dave there.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: We're not doing a +1 system. The wedding is only people we love and cherish and their families that we love and cherish.

It is completely normal for people t see their parents as a constant and most of the people who do will get upset/confused if the structure changes. Such as like a divorce would still upset many people who don't even live with their parents anymore and have families of their own and it seems illogical they should be upset about a thing that influences them so minimally at that point. But because parents represent a constant, safe space and home for them in their subconscious, they get thrown out of balance by the change and that just means they had a good enough relationship with their parents to consider them the one solid point in their life. Now this is adding a person instead of breaking up two, but the principle stays the same, it is a change to the fundament of OPs mental safe space and it makes him very uncomfortable hence he chose to distance himself from the source of the change. You should not blame him for that.\n\nThen you need to add the factor of Dave being the same age as OP and living in his old room and that's just plainly icky.

This is probably gonna end up downvoted to hell, but here I go~ \n\nI think some people are wanting to blindly validate all poly relationships, and make it seem like OP and the NTAers feel that way because they aren\u2019t accepting of poly relationships.

I\u2019m not saying this situation is an example of that, I don\u2019t think we have enough info to say one way or the other. Just if you want people to validate poly relationships, then you need to acknowledge the POSSIBILITY that not all of them are healthy, the same way not all monogamous relationships are healthy. Imagine if the parents had gotten a divorce, and one of them re married someone OP\u2019s age that moved in to OP\u2019s childhood room and that wasn\u2019t that close to OP. Would you tell OP they\u2019re wrong for feeling uncomfortable with the relationship?\n\nLike it\u2019s very true you can\u2019t choose who you love. But OP can\u2019t choose who their parents are. Yes the parents are allowed to have their own lives. But parents also need to understand, just because your child is a grown adult, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a parent anymore. The older your child gets, it might not be as hands on or as time consuming as it once was. And the parents should absolutely do what makes them happy and what\u2019s right for their relationship. \n\nBut you are still your child\u2019s parents, and there will still be times when you should put your child\u2019s comforts before your own, and expect nothing in return from them. Because at the end of the day, they didn\u2019t ask to be born, they didn\u2019t ask for you to be their parents or raise them or provide for them. You decided to do all that for them. They owe you nothing in return because you decided to do all that, not them. And your new relationship, with a new person who you chose to be with and chose to be with you, should not come before your relationship with your child who had no say in their relationship with you.\n\nOP isn\u2019t saying they don\u2019t want Dave to come because they would be embarrassed or because they\u2019re trying to shame their parents. They aren\u2019t telling them to end things with Dave because they\u2019re uncomfortable. They haven\u2019t even brought up the relationship to their parents before, because they know that\u2019s not for them to decide. They\u2019re asking, for one of the most important days of their lives, to only be surrounded with people who know them and love them and not with a stranger.

Otoh, if you were invited to a family event but then told that your partner wasn't welcome because someone disapproves of your relationship would you be happy about it?\n\nI don't think anybody is being unreasonable here. I think you probably do need to do some processing about your parents' relationship though, it sounds like you have some quite strong feelings about it which you're trying to handwave away.", "YTA. Hear me out. Everyone can relate but only because it\u2019s hard to accept that three people form a serious family unit.\n\nHowever, it seems they do. Then situation is not different from inviting anyone else without their partner. I understand that society isn\u2019t very accepting to such, and it seems you personally aren\u2019t acceptive either. However if we were talking about a gay couple answers would be different.\n\nHypocrisy. Think about it.", "NTA. But be honest with yourself. Reading your comments, you aren't comfortable with your parents being poly and that is fair enough. You don't say how many people are aware of situation and it would be hard to have your parents come out as poly at your wedding. Same as declaring any engagement.\n\nBut you are making a choice Though it is one I think your parents are unfair forcing you into. Accept their relationship or lose them. Dave, I think, is more a symbol of them moving away from you than a person in your mind. He isn't close to you so doesn't need to be at your wedding except that he is in a relationship with your parents. And may be around for a long time. \n\nI don't think you are wrong for making this choice but  be honest about why. Is it worry about being upstage, shame, jealousy about being replaced by someone same age as you in house or what?", "NTA, I guess.  \n\nBut \u2026 it\u2019s not unusual for the couple\u2019s parents (especially the bride\u2019s parents) to feel that they have a small number of close friends that they really would like to come to their child\u2019s wedding, and that it would be very embarrassing if they couldn\u2019t come.  \n\nEspecially in cultures where the parents are actually paying for the wedding, or at least have some hosting duties in relation to it. \n\nWhether it\u2019s your mother\u2019s lifelong best friend from school, or your parents\u2019 lover, I think the gracious thing to do would be to let your parents have a couple of people of their own choosing on the guest list.", "NTA probably only because it is your wedding, BUT it's not like they'll be having relations on the dinner table they just want a person they consider an important part of their life with them...", "YTA\n\n\nYou can choose not to have them thier and theu can choose not to come. \n\n\nIf you were lgbt then they could choose not to accept it the same way.", "I'm trying to think of this in another way.mm What if parents split up and had a Same sex partner who was OP'S  age.. would not inviting that partner be okay as well? \nNot saying that OP is wrong, but are the parents really wrong in not wanting to attend without their significant other? or am I missing something here ?", "YTA. When did people become so prejudiced and judgmental? Everyone believes in personal freedom until someone uses that freedom to be different. We don't have to all enter polycules ourselves but we do need to be tolerant and understanding of people's different needs and preferences. If you love your parents, you should support them in their relationship decisions. That seems like a no-brainer to me.\n\nI feel that most of the responses here are a disgust response from prudish, judgemental people and it's no different to people justifying their homophobia with their own personal feelings of disgust. Nobody likes to think about their parents as sexual beings but part of becoming an adult is being able to see your parents as human beings with their own needs and desires.\n\nTl;dr: Everyone should be free to love who they choose, and they shouldn't have to hide their love just because of the judgement of others.", "Soft ESH, but your parents more so.\n\nThey are in a relationship with someone else who they love and shouldn\u2019t be forced to pick and choose between their partner and you. So, I think you are wrong for giving them an ultimatum.\n\nBut I also believe that they are wrong in trying to force you to allow their partner to attend the wedding for a couple reasons. Firstly, based off your post, it seems not many people in your family are aware they are polyamorous. It seems like they want to use your wedding to \u201cshow off\u201d their relationship, which is wrong. Secondly, if you are indeed unfamiliar with their partner and not giving guests plus ones, I think you are simply treating your parents like other guests, which is not wrong.", "INFO: they're in a polycule relationship, but only with one other person?

It doesn't make a difference in the judgement on its face, but I think it's important in terms of what OP understands about their parents' relationship, which could affect the judgement.)\n\nA lot of weddings have a \"freebie\" list for parents to add a certain number of friends they want at the wedding. Sometimes they are people you barely know, but it's important to your parents that those people are at important family moments of theirs. Maybe their new life partner could fall under that section for them. You don't have to include him in the ceremony, and you can discuss with your parents ahead of time how much you want or don't want him included, but you must keep in mind that *they consider him family* just as much as one of your parents would likely consider a long time partner after they've been divorced.\n\nIt is, first and foremost, your special moment, and therefore your decision, but please consider that this is also their special moment, and while they can't dictate or act entitled about what you decide, it would be considerate, living, and are the very least, polite, for you to allow them to share it with the person whom they love quite a bit less than you, but still pretty high up there...

Heck no What it comes down to is realising they see this person as more important than their child and his wedding day. They see the whole wedding as about them and their toy. So the question is do you want to be miserable in your wedding day being made uncomfortable by this person being there knowing he\u2019s getting introduced to all your friends and brides family. Feeling more and more uncomfortable on the day that\u2019s supposed to be your happiest and about you, bride and those you love. All whilst knowing you are going through ruining your wedding for parents who don\u2019t even care about you nor your wedding.\n\nThis is reason to walk away from the relationship for most.

Personally I\u2019d rather be sad they missed the wedding than be uncomfortable and stress all the run up to the day and then more so for the whole wedding itself.I\u2019ve been here my husbands family turned our wedding into there\u2019s. They paid nothing and demanded everything. It was argument after argument and strained things between my fianc\u00e9 as no matter how we compromised it had to be exactly what they wanted and then they demand more. It got ridiculous and when they demanded someone they hate and hadn\u2019t seen in decades since their own wedding, after complaining repeatedly how they were forced to have these people at their wedding. We who wanted a smallish wedding and they had forced a huge wedding were to also pay for these people to come. Hell no. Since we refused this one thing as even my fianc\u00e9 who had been trained to let them have anything said no way. They refused to come to the wedding cut us off and banned ALL HIS FAMILY from coming on threat of hell if they do.\n\nI felt awful but my fianc\u00e9 was relieved and happy. We set about cutting down the wedding and changing it back to what us two wanted. He reached out a couple of months before the wedding (18 months after the incident) to say they could still come. Their response was his mum wouldn\u2019t have time to get a dress. Of course his family was still banned as well. On the day I checked in how he was and he admitted he was happy and fully knew if they came it would have been hell and he would have been anxious the whole led up and on the day.

If someone close to you tells you they are sleeping with someone, you don't ask for a facetime to get to know them or text an introduction, it's on your friend to set the tone for how integrated they want you and their new partner to be.", "[In case you get curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/vwkyoz/oop_has_to_deal_with_her_mother_dressing_up_as/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)", "Oh poor soul.

Which is not even possible in all places.", "Lol.\n\nOp\u2019s parents are disrespecting their child. When they decided to open up their marriage (the foundation of Op\u2019s family) for sexual gratification with a kid Op\u2019s age - they didn\u2019t ask Op if it made them uncomfortable. They put themselves first.", "Sure!! There\u2019s definitely people who would explain it better than me. I\u2019ll do my best!\n\nJust a note: triads are actually made up of multiple separate relationships between dyads. A&B, B&C, A&C. Each of those relationships requires individual attention and nurturing. \nSome people happen to end up in a triad that works, usually they\u2019re not closed to other dating. In a closed triad the three people involved are expected not to date outside the triad. \n\nIt is when people specifically want a closed triad that problems arise most often. \n\nAs you\u2019ve noticed there\u2019s a power imbalance between the previously established dyad and the newer party. In this case they\u2019re married, and have been for a very long time it seems. So they have legal protection enshrining their relationship and property. They\u2019re much more likely to prioritize that dyad over any other, because it\u2019s an expensive pain in the ass to divorce someone. \n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s pretty fucked up to require someone who dates you to also date (and fuck) your existing partner(s). That\u2019s just deeply unethical. What happens if Dave wants to end things with only one of them? What if one dyad wants to have sex without the third person there? Will that be supported? Not usually. ETA: I mean not usually if the dyad in question is Dave & either of OPs parents. You can bet the married dyad is almost certainly still being intimate just them wo Dave. \n\nDave has moved into a house he doesn\u2019t own. If he\u2019s paying rent they\u2019re now not just his partners but his landlords. He is either paying them money for a house they\u2019ve already paid off, or paying into a home he has no ownership of. That\u2019s a dicey position. \n\nIf this is a closed triad, Dave is being excluded from the possibility of ever having his own deeply enmeshed relationships with anyone. He\u2019s just treated as a guest in their relationship. \n\nWhen you get divorced you can sell the house and divide the money. If you\u2019re common law there\u2019s protections. If Dave needs to leave, is he going to be financially supported in that? Unlikely. \n\n[Unicorns R Us](https://www.unicorns-r-us.com/) does a good job explaining why the polyam community openly rejects closed triads. \n\nEnd note that \u201cunicorn\u201d has a different connotation in polyamory than other kinds of ENM. If you just want to have a three way, finding \u201cunicorns\u201d who are enthusiastic isn\u2019t unethical.", "Idk, I don\u2019t think not inviting someone he doesn\u2019t know to the wedding is the same as forcing them to choose. It\u2019s a wedding, not all of them have plus ones, and I don\u2019t think every wedding that doesn\u2019t give people +1s is monstrous. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re so hung up on him not respecting them. Yeah, he makes that clear, he barely tries to hide it. I wouldn\u2019t. If my parents were in this situation I, again, wouldn\u2019t feel safe around them.\n\nHow does not inviting anyone to my wedding day they can\u2019t do what they want with their rooms?", "Please re-read the post.", "What? It says right in the post. But okay change the goalposts then.", "Absolutely, this will end terribly for both sides. It's now, probably, a no-win situation.", "Oh, I can almost guarantee that no one is coming out of this situation happy at this point, barring a huge compromise from one side or the other.", "Oof! Not this argument think it is. That's pretty crappy that it is okay for OTHERS, but not for your parents.", "This man is 27 years old. This is hardly that.", "Redditors cheering when their dad fucks their sisters 19 year old bestie", "Y'all the only ones, maybe they're your sock", "Why the fuck would a parent ask their kid's permission to date someone?!", "Look at OP's comment history. \"Sure and they can pick between me or dave. Its their choice to make. If they love him more then fine and that's that.\" That's an ultimatum.\n\n> If my parents were in this situation I, again, wouldn\u2019t feel safe around them.\n\nThen why would you be inviting them to your wedding at all? OP is close enough to their parents that they're going over seating charts with them, and yet they haven't bothered to get to know Dave at all.", "Eh I think the parents will ultimately regret choosing the 27 year old they\u2019ve barely known for a year over their only son more. \n\nTheirs an obvious compromise here and it\u2019s not OP having someone they do not feel comfortable around coming to their freaking wedding.", "That\u2019s not necessary true. You yourself said kids leave the nest. Sometimes that means limited or NC between a child and their parents. And both side live their lives happily", "OP wants their PARENTS at their wedding, on the grounds that they're their parents, raised them, and have a close bond with them. Dave did not raise them and they have no bond. Plus, it's absolutely obvious that when your parent(s) date someone your age, whether it's your mom, your dad or both, it's extremely uncomfortable (don't get me started on the boyfriend living in your childhood bedroom???) and not something you want to have to deal with at your wedding. OP not wanting Dave present doesn't have so much to do with polyamory rather than with the fact that \n- he's a stranger,\n- the relationship is honestly creepy (and it would be the same if OP's parents were divorced and Dave was the boyfriend of only one of their parents).\nHow is that so hard to get?", "It is. \n\nTheir child is the man\u2019s age. I wouldn\u2019t feel safe if my parents started dating/sleeping with people my age. Legal adulthood doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s normal to have a partner your child\u2019s age, and I think just about anyone, or most people, get uncomfortable or feel unsafe in that situation.", "The same age as their child. Nd have him sleep in her childhood bedroom making it even creepier. That's disgusting. I'd immediately wonder if they were looking at my friends growing up looking for AP.", "It\u2019s only a year old! That\u2019s barely getting to know a person", "OP is pretty clearly juggling his feelings of lack of safety and disgust at his parents fucking people his age \ud83e\udd2ealongside societal expectations of parent relationships. He doesn\u2019t sound too beat up about it, so I guess he decided that the lack of safety and discomfort won out \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say a kid should get to know their parents partner that is their age. That\u2019s deeply uncomfortable and I think the parents absolutely need to respect that; they\u2019re acting pretty gross about his valid feelings on the matter.", "So you're saying a parents personal relationships is more important than their relationship with their children?", "Right?  There are really some braindead and creepy takes on this. \n\nDave is the same age as OP and even stays in their childhood room.... just weird. Lot to unpack in those few facts alone about the situation,  let alone all of the things unsaid about the situation.", "You can get uncomfortable and still not act like an asshole tho. Be as uncomfortable as you want.", "You are an asshole if you cannot be cordial with your family's significant others. You don't have to get close to them, you don't have to like them, but OP's parents clearly consider Dave their family so it is rude to not respect that. OP is allowing their disgust about Dave's age and polyamory to mess up their relationship with their parents. They need to learn how to tolerate being around Dave during family functions, which a wedding is usually considered.", "I was judging it on Dave having moved in with OP's parents, them making the assumption that Dave was coming (treating themselves as a throuple and indicating that Dave would like to come), and saying they'd rather not come if Dave isn't welcome. If I had to guess, they feel OP is being disrepectful of Dave and their relationship with him."]}
