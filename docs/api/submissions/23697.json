I've always been mildly uncomfortable with it just due to a variety of features about the whole thing. For starters the man is as young as I am and he basically now lives in my former room growing up. I don't say anything about it as its their life and they can live it as they like but, and I'll be completely honest here, all of it sort of discomforts me. Nevertheless, I have my own life and I still love them and I try not to think of that in any capacity. They are happy and that's good for them.\n\nWith that background out of the way. I am getting married soon and I wanted my parents to be there ofc. They were happy for me and it was great. Then my SO and I got to arranging everything for the wedding and we eventually began arranging the seating. I wanted to run my seating plan by my parents as they know some people better so I emailed it to them and asked them to look it over. They looked it over and then they called me that I had missed a seat for Dave (fake name for their significant other). I told them I didn't think Dave would be coming. They said they would be all coming and I said I'm not sure if its a good idea. I try to tip-toe to gently tell them to not bring Dave but they were insistent, so I was frank with them. I told them I was uncomfortable with Dave coming and I wanted to share my special day with them, not Dave. I tried to explain why I didn't think it was appropriate.\n\nAt this point, things took a turn for the worse. We had a back and forth which basically devolved into a fight. Eventually, they basically said they'd much rather just not come if they couldn't come as a couple. I, in a moment of anger, then said \"great, then don't come\" in a passive aggressive tone.\n\nI haven't talked to my parents since then. In a way I feel like they've changed so much from when I was young. I still love them and I still wanted them to come but all of this is just not how I imagined my wedding going. It's their life to live but this is my wedding. Its supposed to be about me and my SO surrounded by people we cherish. Dave and I have no relationship. He is a stranger to me and, respectfully, I genuinely am completely fine with that.\n\nI want them to come but if they want to bring Dave, I much rather they just don't. I love them but I don't want Dave there.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: We're not doing a +1 system. The wedding is only people we love and cherish and their families that we love and cherish.

It is completely normal for people t see their parents as a constant and most of the people who do will get upset/confused if the structure changes. Such as like a divorce would still upset many people who don't even live with their parents anymore and have families of their own and it seems illogical they should be upset about a thing that influences them so minimally at that point. But because parents represent a constant, safe space and home for them in their subconscious, they get thrown out of balance by the change and that just means they had a good enough relationship with their parents to consider them the one solid point in their life. Now this is adding a person instead of breaking up two, but the principle stays the same, it is a change to the fundament of OPs mental safe space and it makes him very uncomfortable hence he chose to distance himself from the source of the change. You should not blame him for that.\n\nThen you need to add the factor of Dave being the same age as OP and living in his old room and that's just plainly icky.

This is probably gonna end up downvoted to hell, but here I go~ \n\nI think some people are wanting to blindly validate all poly relationships, and make it seem like OP and the NTAers feel that way because they aren\u2019t accepting of poly relationships.

I\u2019m not saying this situation is an example of that, I don\u2019t think we have enough info to say one way or the other. Just if you want people to validate poly relationships, then you need to acknowledge the POSSIBILITY that not all of them are healthy, the same way not all monogamous relationships are healthy. Imagine if the parents had gotten a divorce, and one of them re married someone OP\u2019s age that moved in to OP\u2019s childhood room and that wasn\u2019t that close to OP. Would you tell OP they\u2019re wrong for feeling uncomfortable with the relationship?\n\nLike it\u2019s very true you can\u2019t choose who you love. But OP can\u2019t choose who their parents are. Yes the parents are allowed to have their own lives. But parents also need to understand, just because your child is a grown adult, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a parent anymore. The older your child gets, it might not be as hands on or as time consuming as it once was. And the parents should absolutely do what makes them happy and what\u2019s right for their relationship. \n\nBut you are still your child\u2019s parents, and there will still be times when you should put your child\u2019s comforts before your own, and expect nothing in return from them. Because at the end of the day, they didn\u2019t ask to be born, they didn\u2019t ask for you to be their parents or raise them or provide for them. You decided to do all that for them. They owe you nothing in return because you decided to do all that, not them. And your new relationship, with a new person who you chose to be with and chose to be with you, should not come before your relationship with your child who had no say in their relationship with you.\n\nOP isn\u2019t saying they don\u2019t want Dave to come because they would be embarrassed or because they\u2019re trying to shame their parents. They aren\u2019t telling them to end things with Dave because they\u2019re uncomfortable. They haven\u2019t even brought up the relationship to their parents before, because they know that\u2019s not for them to decide. They\u2019re asking, for one of the most important days of their lives, to only be surrounded with people who know them and love them and not with a stranger.

Otoh, if you were invited to a family event but then told that your partner wasn't welcome because someone disapproves of your relationship would you be happy about it?\n\nI don't think anybody is being unreasonable here. I think you probably do need to do some processing about your parents' relationship though, it sounds like you have some quite strong feelings about it which you're trying to handwave away.", "YTA. Hear me out. Everyone can relate but only because it\u2019s hard to accept that three people form a serious family unit.\n\nHowever, it seems they do. Then situation is not different from inviting anyone else without their partner. I understand that society isn\u2019t very accepting to such, and it seems you personally aren\u2019t acceptive either. However if we were talking about a gay couple answers would be different.\n\nHypocrisy. Think about it.", "NTA. But be honest with yourself. Reading your comments, you aren't comfortable with your parents being poly and that is fair enough. You don't say how many people are aware of situation and it would be hard to have your parents come out as poly at your wedding. Same as declaring any engagement.\n\nBut you are making a choice Though it is one I think your parents are unfair forcing you into. Accept their relationship or lose them. Dave, I think, is more a symbol of them moving away from you than a person in your mind. He isn't close to you so doesn't need to be at your wedding except that he is in a relationship with your parents. And may be around for a long time. \n\nI don't think you are wrong for making this choice but  be honest about why. Is it worry about being upstage, shame, jealousy about being replaced by someone same age as you in house or what?", "NTA, I guess.  \n\nBut \u2026 it\u2019s not unusual for the couple\u2019s parents (especially the bride\u2019s parents) to feel that they have a small number of close friends that they really would like to come to their child\u2019s wedding, and that it would be very embarrassing if they couldn\u2019t come.  \n\nEspecially in cultures where the parents are actually paying for the wedding, or at least have some hosting duties in relation to it. \n\nWhether it\u2019s your mother\u2019s lifelong best friend from school, or your parents\u2019 lover, I think the gracious thing to do would be to let your parents have a couple of people of their own choosing on the guest list.", "NTA probably only because it is your wedding, BUT it's not like they'll be having relations on the dinner table they just want a person they consider an important part of their life with them...", "YTA\n\n\nYou can choose not to have them thier and theu can choose not to come. \n\n\nIf you were lgbt then they could choose not to accept it the same way.", "I'm trying to think of this in another way.mm What if parents split up and had a Same sex partner who was OP'S  age.. would not inviting that partner be okay as well? \nNot saying that OP is wrong, but are the parents really wrong in not wanting to attend without their significant other? or am I missing something here ?", "YTA. When did people become so prejudiced and judgmental? Everyone believes in personal freedom until someone uses that freedom to be different. We don't have to all enter polycules ourselves but we do need to be tolerant and understanding of people's different needs and preferences. If you love your parents, you should support them in their relationship decisions. That seems like a no-brainer to me.\n\nI feel that most of the responses here are a disgust response from prudish, judgemental people and it's no different to people justifying their homophobia with their own personal feelings of disgust. Nobody likes to think about their parents as sexual beings but part of becoming an adult is being able to see your parents as human beings with their own needs and desires.\n\nTl;dr: Everyone should be free to love who they choose, and they shouldn't have to hide their love just because of the judgement of others.", "Soft ESH, but your parents more so.\n\nThey are in a relationship with someone else who they love and shouldn\u2019t be forced to pick and choose between their partner and you. So, I think you are wrong for giving them an ultimatum.\n\nBut I also believe that they are wrong in trying to force you to allow their partner to attend the wedding for a couple reasons. Firstly, based off your post, it seems not many people in your family are aware they are polyamorous. It seems like they want to use your wedding to \u201cshow off\u201d their relationship, which is wrong. Secondly, if you are indeed unfamiliar with their partner and not giving guests plus ones, I think you are simply treating your parents like other guests, which is not wrong.", "INFO: they're in a polycule relationship, but only with one other person?

It doesn't make a difference in the judgement on its face, but I think it's important in terms of what OP understands about their parents' relationship, which could affect the judgement.)\n\nA lot of weddings have a \"freebie\" list for parents to add a certain number of friends they want at the wedding. Sometimes they are people you barely know, but it's important to your parents that those people are at important family moments of theirs. Maybe their new life partner could fall under that section for them. You don't have to include him in the ceremony, and you can discuss with your parents ahead of time how much you want or don't want him included, but you must keep in mind that *they consider him family* just as much as one of your parents would likely consider a long time partner after they've been divorced.\n\nIt is, first and foremost, your special moment, and therefore your decision, but please consider that this is also their special moment, and while they can't dictate or act entitled about what you decide, it would be considerate, living, and are the very least, polite, for you to allow them to share it with the person whom they love quite a bit less than you, but still pretty high up there...

Feeling more and more uncomfortable on the day that\u2019s supposed to be your happiest and about you, bride and those you love. All whilst knowing you are going through ruining your wedding for parents who don\u2019t even care about you nor your wedding.\n\nThis is reason to walk away from the relationship for most.

They paid nothing and demanded everything. It was argument after argument and strained things between my fianc\u00e9 as no matter how we compromised it had to be exactly what they wanted and then they demand more. It got ridiculous and when they demanded someone they hate and hadn\u2019t seen in decades since their own wedding, after complaining repeatedly how they were forced to have these people at their wedding. We who wanted a smallish wedding and they had forced a huge wedding were to also pay for these people to come. Hell no. Since we refused this one thing as even my fianc\u00e9 who had been trained to let them have anything said no way. They refused to come to the wedding cut us off and banned ALL HIS FAMILY from coming on threat of hell if they do.\n\nI felt awful but my fianc\u00e9 was relieved and happy. We set about cutting down the wedding and changing it back to what us two wanted. He reached out a couple of months before the wedding (18 months after the incident) to say they could still come. Their response was his mum wouldn\u2019t have time to get a dress. Of course his family was still banned as well. On the day I checked in how he was and he admitted he was happy and fully knew if they came it would have been hell and he would have been anxious the whole led up and on the day.

I\u2019ll do my best!\n\nJust a note: triads are actually made up of multiple separate relationships between dyads. A&B, B&C, A&C. Each of those relationships requires individual attention and nurturing. \nSome people happen to end up in a triad that works, usually they\u2019re not closed to other dating. In a closed triad the three people involved are expected not to date outside the triad. \n\nIt is when people specifically want a closed triad that problems arise most often. \n\nAs you\u2019ve noticed there\u2019s a power imbalance between the previously established dyad and the newer party. In this case they\u2019re married, and have been for a very long time it seems. So they have legal protection enshrining their relationship and property. They\u2019re much more likely to prioritize that dyad over any other, because it\u2019s an expensive pain in the ass to divorce someone. \n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s pretty fucked up to require someone who dates you to also date (and fuck) your existing partner(s). That\u2019s just deeply unethical. What happens if Dave wants to end things with only one of them? What if one dyad wants to have sex without the third person there? Will that be supported? Not usually. ETA: I mean not usually if the dyad in question is Dave & either of OPs parents. You can bet the married dyad is almost certainly still being intimate just them wo Dave. \n\nDave has moved into a house he doesn\u2019t own. If he\u2019s paying rent they\u2019re now not just his partners but his landlords. He is either paying them money for a house they\u2019ve already paid off, or paying into a home he has no ownership of. That\u2019s a dicey position. \n\nIf this is a closed triad, Dave is being excluded from the possibility of ever having his own deeply enmeshed relationships with anyone. He\u2019s just treated as a guest in their relationship. \n\nWhen you get divorced you can sell the house and divide the money. If you\u2019re common law there\u2019s protections. If Dave needs to leave, is he going to be financially supported in that? Unlikely. \n\n[Unicorns R Us](https://www.unicorns-r-us.com/) does a good job explaining why the polyam community openly rejects closed triads. \n\nEnd note that \u201cunicorn\u201d has a different connotation in polyamory than other kinds of ENM.

My parents having a third would give me the ick. \n\nMy parents having a third that is my age would make me vomit.", "A British insult.", "You made me choke on my breakfast thanks for the laugh.", "Yep, I support minimum karma/account age for some subs that need to maintain legitimacy but it does make things tricky if you have a more pressing question.", "I see what you did there!", "Maybe mom need to go from suck to blow", "Also, what if the polyamorous group were, say, five people instead of three? Now everyone has to invite all of them everywhere? The logistics just get difficult.", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t want to spend my wedding day explaining who the strange young guy is that\u2019s dancing with my mom and dad. And it\u2019s going to be the focus of conversation and gossip. There\u2019s a reality here that most people are not going to be accepting of \u201calternative\u201d relationships.", "Exactly. Plus what if they break up? Then OP\u2019s stuck with pictures of an important day in his life of someone he didn\u2019t even want there in the first place.", "I read it like religious defensiveness. You RESPECT their views or you are rejecting them personally.", "This is a symptom of a larger issue. The authority structure of parenting can\u2019t coexist with the length of our relationships with our parents. \n\nOther animals get out of the nest and leave their parents, because their parents are not viable mates. \n\nIt also ruins establishing your own authority to anybody who is dependent on you (children)\n\nWhat\u2019s it like when your manager at work tells you one thing, but then that guys boss comes by and tells you the opposite? You don\u2019t know what to do, and the power structure crumbles.", ":D", "It\u2019s funny, mom didn\u2019t look Druish.", "That's why I raised the possibility that the other parent may be going along with it for some reason. My mother was severely mentally ill, and my father went to extraordinary lengths to make it look as if everything was \"normal.\" People do this kind of thing all the time. (We all know, for example, that in actually *abusive* relationships, the victim will often construct narratives to explain why this is normal, or what they deserve, etc.)\n\nSo it's not impossible that one parent's dementia has led to inappropriate, hyper-sexualized behavior, and the other has rationalized it in terms of a normally consensual polyamorous relationship.\n\nBut *of course* it's impossible for me or anyone else to diagnose this at a distance, especially given the limited information we have about the parents from the OP. I'm just suggesting it as something OP may want to think about, if it makes sense of the situation -- because it seems pretty evident to me that the parents' behavior is far beyond what is healthy.", "> Not the time. Not that place. Not the occasion.\n\nThis is it for me. Besides, if they wanted a relationship between Davis and OP, the wedding is not the place to start either.", "That is just gross. Very selfish. OP is NTA", "That would be as inappropriate as proposing at somebody else\u2019s wedding or announcing a pregnancy. Trying to steal their show on their important day. This is not the time or place for the parents to have a coming out party.", "This is the way. OP need to tell his parents their new fuck buddy can come to the wedding but he's going to be truthful about him being the same age as the OP, living in OP's old room and he does all off OP's old chores ( or whatever parents admit to when he asks) and gets taken out on outings/dates similar to how his parents spoiled him as a child with the only difference being they both have sex with the son replacement. \n\nOP should tell them that if they want to \"come out\" at his wedding then he'll make sure everyone understands the kink dynamic going on, how it makes him feel to be replaced by someone they fuck and how the parents wanted to parade around their new boy toy so badly they threatened to not come to their own son's wedding unless it could also being a coming out attention fest for them. \n\nSee what the parents have to say to that. They're already not coming so what difference does it make?", "I had the same thought... they move in someone their sons age into his childhood bedroom then pick him over their actual son and his wedding... but also they have sex with him.\n\nDude... dude.", "IKR?  We're bored now that our son moved out.  Let's get another one around the same age and set him up in son's room.  But this time, let's get one we can fuck.  Just the thought process is truly disturbing, much less poor OP having to even let those thought flash through his head.  Who needs that shit at your wedding?", "Omg y'all. These comments. I'm sitting in a full, doctor's office waiting room and am now laughing hysterically. And now everyone around me is staring like I'm crazy. Thanks.", "Exactly.", "Not to mention OP's SO family. I usually hate all the US American fuss about the \"thunder\", and their \"special day\", etc... but certainly a wedding is not a coming out/scandalize family and in laws party.", "Just what we need another Druish princess. Thanks mom.", "Fuuucckk I remember that series of posts. It fucked her up bad and led to a lot of self destructive behavior.", "Oh, he pays the rent alright!", "Same... It really creeped me out.", "\u201cThat which has not occurred since time immemorial. The young woman did not fart on her husband\u2019s lap.\u201d\n\nThat is the oldest recorded joke in the world. It\u2019s so old, its structure doesn\u2019t even make sense to us anymore. But we can still tell it\u2019s creepy sex pervert stuff. You\u2019re right. \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit: That is the oldest *complete* joke. Older than that is an incomplete one where only the punchline could be recovered: \u201ca withered penis.\u201d Staying pervy.", "That's what I'm wondering, does Dave even _want_ to go? \n\nLet's take the OPs parents at the fair value and say they have a full equal and fair thruple, no weird power dynamics or anything (probably hard given the relative lengths of time between the the two \"sets\" of relationships, but not impossible). Given that, how often is a partner/SO dragged to something they don't really want to go to because that what a comprises in a relationship is: doing something occasionally because your partner wants to even though you'd rather sit at home and read. I can see Dave, much rather just having a night in that night.", "\"Oh, they rent me their spare room in exchange for, um, 'chores.'\"", "It could be something stupidly boring. People are.\n\nDad lost ability to maintain erection/is asexual and now is perfectly content with snuggles and a younger dude to fill the sexual role.", "They're not making a sandwich with Youngblood in the middle? Because that was my thought.", "Mom could be pegging them both. My mind went there  \ud83e\udd23", "Dave could be the \u201cLucky Pierre\u201d", "OP is gonna need some bleach, a time machine or therapy", "Whole new meaning to a \"love train\"", "If you woke up halfway into your mom and your dad was halfway into you which way you moving to get out?", ">They see him as a full and equal part of their relationship.\n\nWho OP has no relationship with whatsoever and doesn't want to.", "im just gonna say that parents shouldn\u2019t entertain relationships with people their children\u2019s age, or near that age. it\u2019s gross af.", "That doesn't mean that OP has to.", "These people really have no respect for their kids and family.", "Then they should have addressed their child\u2019s unease with their partner before this. They should have been clear that they hoped their child would see Dave as family and listened to OP\u2019s concerns.\n\nJust as even adult kids have feelings about parents new partners post divorce etc.. If the parents haven\u2019t done to work to establish the relationship and facilitate bridge building with the new partners then they can\u2019t be shocked that that relationship doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nYes the parent\u2019s relationship is valid, but OP\u2019s seating chart isn\u2019t the time to suddenly force their child to express a family relationship with Dave that they don\u2019t actually feel.", "Thank you! He lives in the house with them-they are a throuple. NTA because it\u2019s your wedding but reducing it to just a sex act because you\u2019re uncomfortable with someone else\u2019s lifestyle is a little AH-ish", "Legally, he's a fuck buddy who sleeps in a child's room.", "Why can I so easily imagine what this outfit looks like?", "Actually they're all wearing hot dog fingers and sticking them in each other's multiverses", "Dave is young, maybe he can manage it.", "HOOOOly shit.\n\nOr HOLEy shit?", "This might be the best label I've ever seen. As someone in the kink community I am 100% stealing this.", "The Principle of Penetration. \n\nFather of fapping \n\nChief of the Cleveland", "Exactly. Who cares how the parents see him? This isn't their vow renewal. It's their son's wedding. Their son is in charge of who is invited.", "The living in OP's old bedroom part is where it gets icky for me. The rest of it, okay, whatever, have fun. But a guy your kid's age living in your kid's old bedroom that you both have sex with is...unsettling.", "And who actually lives in their child's former bedroom.", "That's the thing that the parents aren't understanding.

And this person they ha e a relationship is not a parent to OP.", "Dave is not invited to the wedding\u2026period. OP has already stated his discomfort with Dave. Why would his parents argue this?", "It is OP\u2018s wedding, even if they invited their brother and didn\u2019t like the brothers wife and said that she can\u2019t come, it would be 100% appropriate. It is completely up to the bride and groom as to who they feel comfortable having to celebrate at their wedding! In this case, OP doesn\u2019t have a problem with them doing their thing, OP has a problem with the fact that the person they chose is OP\u2019s age! Also, OP does not have a relationship with this person, but the parents are trying to force one, and it\u2019s gross.\n\nNTA", "well the third in this story is the fuckable replacement of OP so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb sucks for Dave, but get an age appropriate relationship. this is heebie jeebie city. the desirability of having him around is in the negatives.", "The third person is close in age as OP, parents sound like groomers. It's creepy.", "If it was a genuine 3rd person that would be different. But they sleep in childs room, same age as their child. This is not a full and equal partner, mum and dad it seems have their own room and call on young guy rather than get out a battery operated aid.
