All I know is that it's a terrible financial decision, and I'm tired of these antics of his and that he needs to get a real job or go to college. \n\nSo I told him if he buys that truck, it's going to be the last straw for me.

I understand that he\u2019s living under your roof, but you\u2019re really leaving out a lot of details. He obviously needs a vehicle for work or even finding a job you consider \u201ca real job\u201d. How\u2019s he supposed to do it without decent transportation? Oh mighty one?   Your wife has a point  I\u2019m thinking. Edited for spelling", "YTA because I don't understand why you're so angry at your son.\n\nWhy do you even care if he buys the truck? It sounds like he'll be paying for it himself. And you don't say that you're giving him money all the time. Only that he doesn't pay rent. So if he buys the truck and then can't make the payments or something, that'll be on him, not you. And if he's buying the car for his work, that counts as a business expense.\n\nTaking an old sawmill, fixing it up, and selling lumber doesn't sound \"dumb.\" to me. Why isn't that a \"real job\"?\n\nYou say you don't trust him, but you seem to hate him so much, I wouldn't trust you either. It's clear you have no idea what his real financial situation is.", "YTA on this one.  A $35k new truck is probably pretty low end.  If he has legitimate needs of hauling for his business that has been succeeding enough for him to get approved to buy such a truck, there's no reason not to get one.  \n\nRealistically a used truck for like $20k that can afford to get beat up a little is probably a better option here,  but you're being very unsupportive and with how you don't approve of his work, you probably don't have a great finger on the pulse of how his business is going.\n\n3 years is a significant period of time for someone his age, and while dropping out of school can be easily frowned upon, he sounds resourceful and dedicated.", "INFO: Does he pay rent?\nAnd how do you have any idea what\u2019s in his bank account? I mean, if you have access to it, of course that\u2019s not where he\u2019s putting the money.", "Sorry YTA\n\nIt sounds like your son has made his own little business by himself, but it's a business you don't approve of. \n\nYour son is 19 not 29, so I'd say he's not doing bad if he's making his own money his way. \n\nI saw in the comments you aren't charging him rent. If he's not making enough $$ to support himself then you can show him by charging him rent. Look up the surrounding area and see what a room goes for. If you want to be nice let him know rent will be at a market rate in 6 months, but for now pay half. If he's making enough money to support himself he will see that and maybe he will.move out on his own- which is better for your relationship. If he realizes he _cannot_ support himself maybe he will go to college or get a \"real\" job. Either way he can come to the conclusion himself.\n\nBest of luck OP!", "YTA. I don't even believe this is real. You are mad he runs his own sawmill, and he needs to make a legitimate business purchase? This is written like someone is trying to write a smarmy 80's villan who is mad his kid wants to work with his hands instead of going into the family finance business. If he can get a loan for it without your help, or if he can pay cash, it's nunya.\n\nI teach high school chemistry. If he can buy a 35k truck outright, he is doing a damn sight better than I am with my masters. If I had listened to my heart instead of my shortsighted mother, I would be making gobs of money as an electrician without loan debt. If you are real- BOOO.", "YTA. You sound like someone who looks down on trades. \n\nI don't even know if you like your son. Your entire post seems like you hate him. \n\nHe's making money, he refurbished an old saw mill and is selling the lumbar. I wouldn't trust you with my money either if you were my parent..\n\nIf he has the money he can buy the truck. If he doesn't have the money, a job, decent credit he won't get a loan for the car and then no worry. \n\nYour son sounds like he's doing ok for dropping out. Instead of discouraging you could be encouraging. Let's get your GED, look into a trade of that's what he wants.", "Info: is having a 'screwing match' with your son the best way to handle this?", "YTA. Your replies to people just confirm it. 35k is on the lower end for a truck. You keep saying he doesn't have a job.. but he's buying land, taking the wood and selling the lumber, and then reselling the land. It sounds like you can't let go of how you would do things. You need to accept that your son is his own person. You are missing out on who he is because you're stuck in your disappointment that's he's different than how you would do things", "YTA (although honestly this sounds like the kid posting from what he sees as the Dad\u2019s point of view). If he has enough to buy the truck, and thinks it\u2019s a good investment, then there\u2019s no reason not to. Let him keep living with you until he can afford to move out. With how much you dislike him and act like an AH toward him, I\u2019m sure he wants to move out as soon as possible.", "I just bought a used car for that amount. It's not extravagant; it's something most people need, especially if they're trying to run a small business. In any case, he's 19 and old enough to make his own decisions. Instead of calling him names, calling his friends names, and treating him with utter contempt, why not be neutral or (gasp) helpful? You obviously do not respect him or love him, so he'd probably be better off moving out. But yeah, you're definitely the asshole here.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, he probably has a personal bank account he uses.

WAAAAHHHHHH It\u2019s REALLY hard having ADHD and if he started his own little business then that\u2019s actually fucking amazing. I HAVE ADHD never graduated college and all my ideas of making money haven\u2019t succeeded yet. If you knew anything about ADHD you would know it\u2019s normal for us to have fixations and then get bored of them. Maybe you should work on your relationship with your son but first work on all the resentment you have towards him. Then why don\u2019t you research ADHD and quit being such a prick?

Also some self awareness with your ahole character would make that character more realistic. Most people are not this oblivious. Always fact check your details even in fiction. Details matter.

It is a \"real job\" and I'm sure he's making money hand over fist right now. He must be in high demand. \n\nHave you seen the price of lumber lately? Call up a contractor and try to find one who can get a renovation started sooner than 12-15 months out. \n\nYour son has found a way to adapt his environment to his ADHD. He gets to make his own hours, gets to work with his hands, and runs his own successful business!\n\nWhat a good parent would be worried about is if he's got this all set up legally. If he's doing well enough to buy the truck outright, and he's been keeping his money in cash that sounds a little concerning. He's going to run into issues if he's got no reported income but is dropping $35k in cash on a vehicle. \n\nHe should have an LLC, bank account, liability insurance, an accountant to help him file his taxes, etc. He should be buying the truck through the business. You don't need to have any kind of access or control to his business funds but you should offer him guidance and support rather than trying to force him into a box that's always going to feel suffocating. \n\nAnd if he fails? College is always there! Failure isn't the end of the world, it's just another opportunity to find something that fits. Maybe if you stop pushing, he'll be interested in starting business classes at the local community college to help boost his own business", "Well, charge him rent then. Why are you starting with the nuclear option?\n\nAnd of course he\u2019s not using the bank account. Why would he put his money where you can see it, and potentially withdraw it?", "Of course he doesn't use the one you can monitor.

He's also insistent that he has 35k on hand to buy it outright", "Definitely agree with you on this! Medicine is not for everyone.

I was convinced he was selling drugs a few months ago from his behavior and neat total lack of communication.", "So you don't believe anything your son says,  but it sounds like there are no previous lies to base your assumptions on.  He probably barely lives with you because his parents don't believe a word he says.  Can't blame the kid.  I hope the kids gets his truck and tells you to shove your assumptions about him.", "INFO\nWhy are you so angry?  This kid has gumption and there are plenty of older people that could learn a thing or two from your son.", "YTA for trying to dictate what he spends his money on. That\u2019s not your problem nor is it your choice, and he probably has a bank account you don\u2019t have access to because he\u2019s an adult and he should have a personal account. I had a personal account at 17 (when I moved out for school) and an account my parents had access to for depositing money into in case of emergency. I never deposited into the joint account because my parents don\u2019t need to know how much I made. They just needed to know that I was making enough to not need to ask them for emergency money and they were happy enough with knowing I was well off enough to not need help. That isn\u2019t unreasonable. And also, running his own business IS A JOB. He\u2019s self employed, what don\u2019t you understand about that concept? That\u2019s actually likely to be serving him better financially than his peers who are probably working jobs in retail or fast food for minimum wage while racking up student loan debt. You should be proud of his motivation to do things on his own, especially considering having ADHD! Self management is especially hard for those of us with the issues that come along with having ADHD and the fact that he feels successful and confident in his earnings is something to celebrate, not criticize simply because he isn\u2019t adhering to a standard 9-5 or didn\u2019t rack up college debt to find his niche. \n\nHowever honestly I\u2019m gonna say N T A for the more minor part of this, which seems to be you wanting him to move out over the fact that he doesn\u2019t want or need to listen to your (albeit misinformed) advice- if he can afford to pay outright for a brand new 35k vehicle on top of frivolous spending and buying land, realtor fees, etc. he can presumably afford to live on his own. If he does truly have the money for it I think you\u2019re well within your right to say \u201cyou can obviously make enough to support yourself if you are confident in making this decision, so I think it\u2019s time for you to start looking for your own place to live.\u201d But framing it as \u201cif you spend your money the way you want to I\u2019m kicking you out\u201d is an AH move despite it being a reasonable conclusion to make from his apparent earnings and spending habits. If you\u2019re not charging him rent and also paying to feed him and he\u2019s saved up, it\u2019s likely because he hasn\u2019t had any living expenses, and if he HAS been paying to live with you then he should be more than capable of moving out.\n\nAnd frankly, with the hostile relationship you seem to have with him, I think suggesting him moving out to make some space would be a good thing. You seem stressed about his proximity while not being able to parent him like a child anymore. He\u2019s probably stressed about having parents looming and trying to dictate his situation. I didn\u2019t even have those issues with my relationship with my parents, and moving out has greatly improved our relationship. If you want to have a relationship with him moving forward it seems like getting out of each other\u2019s space so you don\u2019t feel as much need to control and he feels less need to defend himself or hide things in his own home would be best for both of you.", "How exactly do you think he\u2019s going to get a 35k truck without proving he\u2019s able to pay for said vehicle?

His investment of 500 bucks for the sawmill and maybe a couple hundred more to fix it up could reasonably be explained with saving from that endeavor. And if he diligently reinvested into his business to the point that, again according to OP himself, he has enough he can buy relatively cheap wooded land, extract the available lumber from it and sell it for profit, and then sell the land on, lather, rinse, repeat then there's nothing \"suddenly\" or inexplicable about him having monetary assets.\n\nAnd who says it's \"all in cash\"? It's not in an account his parents opened for him back in the day, aka the one they would have access to. That doesn't mean it's not in *any* account that he might have opened himself once he was 18.", "Ah, so you're the type who thinks you have to go to college for a good job.", "All those degrees and still a dumbass. Your perfect proof to show just because you finish school doesn\u2019t make you smart. Kid sounds like he\u2019s doing fine and just hates you. \n\n\nYTA for being exhausting.", "So you know nothing about the world your son is entering? \n\nLet me tell you, he sounds great. 35K Toyota instead of a super expensive new Ford means he\u2019s not just being frivolous. It sounds like he\u2019s enterprising and already making money at 19.\n\nJust charge him rent and let him choose stay or go but why would you be involved with his choice of car?", "But you had a kid at age 23? Hmmm.", "So if your son grew his business to make a comparable income, would you respect him then? Is it the fact you don't know how much he's making or the fact you don't seem to respect people who don't have post secondary education?", "You are highly disappointed in your son and his choices, and you are continuing to push him away by trying to force him to be what you want him to be. He isn\u2019t you and he isn\u2019t going to be you, ever.

Many trades require certifications and/or diplomas from trade schools. The trade schools require you to be in high school, have a diploma, or something called a general education diploma. Many jobs require you to have a high school diploma or general education diploma as well.", "In my state it is against the law to just stop going to school when you are 16.", "Yeah sorry, my spelling is embarrassingly bad for a 40 year old man and I'm responding so quickly I'm not proof reading enough. Lol", "Then what? Would the cops just come to your house and arrest you for that?"]}
