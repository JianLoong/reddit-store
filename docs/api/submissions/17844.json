How do you know he can't afford the truck?", "YTA. \n\nYou don't know how much your son makes or what exactly he does but it is obvious that he is making good money and is in fact working. Why do you assume he doesn't have a real job? It may not fit into your box for employment but it is seemingly successful. \n\nIt might be better for him to find his own place and to simply not speak to you any further.", "INFO!!\n\nIs he making good money? HAS he saved it up? Or are you on some big power trip because he didn\u2019t consult you or get your permission? I understand that he\u2019s living under your roof, but you\u2019re really leaving out a lot of details. He obviously needs a vehicle for work or even finding a job you consider \u201ca real job\u201d. How\u2019s he supposed to do it without decent transportation? Oh mighty one?   Your wife has a point  I\u2019m thinking. Edited for spelling", "YTA because I don't understand why you're so angry at your son.\n\nWhy do you even care if he buys the truck? It sounds like he'll be paying for it himself. And you don't say that you're giving him money all the time. Only that he doesn't pay rent. So if he buys the truck and then can't make the payments or something, that'll be on him, not you. And if he's buying the car for his work, that counts as a business expense.\n\nTaking an old sawmill, fixing it up, and selling lumber doesn't sound \"dumb.\" to me. Why isn't that a \"real job\"?\n\nYou say you don't trust him, but you seem to hate him so much, I wouldn't trust you either. It's clear you have no idea what his real financial situation is.", "YTA on this one.  A $35k new truck is probably pretty low end.  If he has legitimate needs of hauling for his business that has been succeeding enough for him to get approved to buy such a truck, there's no reason not to get one.  \n\nRealistically a used truck for like $20k that can afford to get beat up a little is probably a better option here,  but you're being very unsupportive and with how you don't approve of his work, you probably don't have a great finger on the pulse of how his business is going.\n\n3 years is a significant period of time for someone his age, and while dropping out of school can be easily frowned upon, he sounds resourceful and dedicated.", "INFO: Does he pay rent?\nAnd how do you have any idea what\u2019s in his bank account? I mean, if you have access to it, of course that\u2019s not where he\u2019s putting the money.", "Sorry YTA\n\nIt sounds like your son has made his own little business by himself, but it's a business you don't approve of. \n\nYour son is 19 not 29, so I'd say he's not doing bad if he's making his own money his way. \n\nI saw in the comments you aren't charging him rent. If he's not making enough $$ to support himself then you can show him by charging him rent. Look up the surrounding area and see what a room goes for. If you want to be nice let him know rent will be at a market rate in 6 months, but for now pay half. If he's making enough money to support himself he will see that and maybe he will.move out on his own- which is better for your relationship. If he realizes he _cannot_ support himself maybe he will go to college or get a \"real\" job. Either way he can come to the conclusion himself.\n\nBest of luck OP!", "YTA. I don't even believe this is real. You are mad he runs his own sawmill, and he needs to make a legitimate business purchase? This is written like someone is trying to write a smarmy 80's villan who is mad his kid wants to work with his hands instead of going into the family finance business. If he can get a loan for it without your help, or if he can pay cash, it's nunya.\n\nI teach high school chemistry. If he can buy a 35k truck outright, he is doing a damn sight better than I am with my masters. If I had listened to my heart instead of my shortsighted mother, I would be making gobs of money as an electrician without loan debt. If you are real- BOOO.", "YTA. You sound like someone who looks down on trades. \n\nI don't even know if you like your son. Your entire post seems like you hate him. \n\nHe's making money, he refurbished an old saw mill and is selling the lumbar. I wouldn't trust you with my money either if you were my parent..\n\nIf he has the money he can buy the truck. If he doesn't have the money, a job, decent credit he won't get a loan for the car and then no worry. \n\nYour son sounds like he's doing ok for dropping out. Instead of discouraging you could be encouraging. Let's get your GED, look into a trade of that's what he wants.", "Info: is having a 'screwing match' with your son the best way to handle this?", "YTA. Your replies to people just confirm it. 35k is on the lower end for a truck. You keep saying he doesn't have a job.. but he's buying land, taking the wood and selling the lumber, and then reselling the land. It sounds like you can't let go of how you would do things. You need to accept that your son is his own person. You are missing out on who he is because you're stuck in your disappointment that's he's different than how you would do things", "YTA (although honestly this sounds like the kid posting from what he sees as the Dad\u2019s point of view). If he has enough to buy the truck, and thinks it\u2019s a good investment, then there\u2019s no reason not to. Let him keep living with you until he can afford to move out. With how much you dislike him and act like an AH toward him, I\u2019m sure he wants to move out as soon as possible.", "I just bought a used car for that amount. It's not extravagent; it's something most people need, especially if they're trying to run a small business. In any case, he's 19 and old enough to make his own decisions. Instead of calling him names, calling his friends names, and treating him with utter contempt, why not be neutral or (gasp) helpful? You obviously do not respect him or love him, so he'd probably be better off moving out. But yeah, you're definitely the asshole here.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, he probably has a personal bank account he uses. He makes profit of the wood he sells and probably makes even more from the land he sells after hes done with the wood. I wouldnt trust my parents either if they were like you", "YTA I read some of ur comments. You talk badly about ur ADHD son who is making his own money but not using a joint bank account with you. WAAAAHHHHHH It\u2019s REALLY hard having ADHD and if he started his own little business then that\u2019s actually fucking amazing. I HAVE ADHD never graduated college and all my ideas of making money haven\u2019t succeeded yet. If you knew anything about ADHD you would know it\u2019s normal for us to have fixations and then get bored of them. Maybe you should work on your relationship with your son but first work on all the resentment you have towards him. Then why don\u2019t you research ADHD and quit being such a prick? Do you even know your son or understand him?? Honestly with how you speak about him I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t trust you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s pretty entrepreneurial.", "Yta, geez and you wonder why he doesn't show you anything", "YTA\n\n$35K for a truck, especially one necessary for work which probably needs a specific towing/hauling capacity is not outlandish- a good GMC diesel will run you $65K at least! He sounds responsible and he\u2019s not asking for your help financially so what\u2019s the issue? You jealous he\u2019ll have a nicer rig than you? I have a 15yo daughter and I\u2019d be so proud if she started her own business and was this enterprising at 18! So again.

Frankly every detail in this is just too over the top. The Dad is too obviously wrong. Unless you are currently in middle school this is a poor attempt at creative writing.\n\n If you are in middle school, be more subtle. The ahole doesn't have to be obviously satan. Also some self awareness with your ahole character would make that character more realistic. Most people are not this oblivious. Always fact check your details even in fiction. Details matter. The little detail about dropping out of highschool ruined the believability of this story. Finally, always proofread.

Tough love time", "NTA. If he is doing so well he can clearly make it on his own...right?", "YTA.  Unless your kid is asking you to co-sign or otherwise subsidize their purchase, it's none of your business.     \n\n\nFeel free to start charging nominal rent, if it makes you feel better, but stay out of his business decisions.", "YTA. This seems like a very strange thing to be upset about on your side. He\u2019s planning to buy a vehicle, and will be paying for it himself. You don\u2019t think he has the money anyway (why do you believe this?), so if that\u2019s true he won\u2019t even be getting it, so you\u2019re just ranting over his wish for the vehicle. If you want him to use his money toward household expenses/rent to start living like an adult, you sure can, but flipping out over him spending his own money doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nI would hide my money from you, too, based on your responses and disdain for his entrepreneurship.", "YTA so he's making a living but because he's not doing what you want he deserves to be kicked out, of course he's making money but he's an adult you don't have to see his bank account, i'm betting he's more successful than you even without his highschool diploma and that keeps you up at night", "YTA.

If he has the money, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. But if he can afford that, he can afford to pay rent. It\u2019s up to you whether he pays rent to you or to someone else.

NTA and time for him to move out if he has the money for the truck then he has the money to live on his own.  Your relationship would likely improve if he moves out.", "Info:\n\nWhere the fuck do you think he's getting the money then? You just randomly don't believe him yet he keeps producing the money.

You don\u2019t seem great tbh.", "If he has a successful saw mill, then encourage him to register truck as a business expense as he is using it for hauling.

Ur so out of touch with reality.

Plus, color me stupid, but he\u2019s actually buying land, selling the wood, and selling the land At possibly top prices.. so he\u2019s definitely making money if he\u2019s telling the truth. .. the thing is, you have no idea nor the communication skills to actually discuss it with him without dragging him for everything he says or does. I wouldn\u2019t trust you either.", "He doesn\u2019t need to show it to you, just the car dealership. This is a transaction between them.

Why make it a thing?", "Why should he trust you when you clearly don't trust him?", "A quality truck to use for work? Absolutely. $35k is low end.", "As someone with  ADHD. Medication does not work for everyone. The first one I tried made my head feel heavy and foggy.  Sometimes medication just isn't the answer. He is running his own business clearly with ADHD and a hs drop out. He's doing ok.\n\nEdit words", "Your son's current profession sounds perfect for someone with ADHD! It is a \"real job\" and I'm sure he's making money hand over fist right now. He must be in high demand. \n\nHave you seen the price of lumber lately? Call up a contractor and try to find one who can get a renovation started sooner than 12-15 months out. \n\nYour son has found a way to adapt his environment to his ADHD. He gets to make his own hours, gets to work with his hands, and runs his own successful business!\n\nWhat a good parent would be worried about is if he's got this all set up legally. If he's doing well enough to buy the truck outright, and he's been keeping his money in cash that sounds a little concerning. He's going to run into issues if he's got no reported income but is dropping $35k in cash on a vehicle. \n\nHe should have an LLC, bank account, liability insurance, an accountant to help him file his taxes, etc. He should be buying the truck through the business. You don't need to have any kind of access or control to his business funds but you should offer him guidance and support rather than trying to force him into a box that's always going to feel suffocating. \n\nAnd if he fails? College is always there! Failure isn't the end of the world, it's just another opportunity to find something that fits. Maybe if you stop pushing, he'll be interested in starting business classes at the local community college to help boost his own business", "Well, charge him rent then. Why are you starting with the nuclear option?\n\nAnd of course he\u2019s not using the bank account. Why would he put his money where you can see it, and potentially withdraw it?", "Of course he doesn't use the one you can monitor.  Cause you're an AH and your son obviously knows that.", "Where do you live?", "Was a thought I had. But equally likely he has learnt to hide income from his judgemental parents.", "The kid started off collecting firewood to sell.  That sounds like business sense to me.  Maybe that's the kid's aptitude.  Some people are really good at seeing potential and running businesses.", "Well he's insistent that I don't go to the dealer with him. That's why. He's also insistent that he has 35k on hand to buy it outright", "Definitely agree with you on this! Medicine is not for everyone. I had to use a med for ADHD/ADD that was actually for high blood pressure because the stimulants made me exhausted and sick. OP, YTA hardcore.", "Yeah, this seems the obvious thing to do - make him pay a fair rent for the area. Everything else is up to him. I'm not surprised he's not using the joint bank account.", "Alaska", "Why are you so insistent that your son's a liar? Why don't you believe him?", "So what\u2019s gonna happen? He goes and gets it or doesn\u2019t. Why start an argument over it.", "And fair rent is for a room\u2014not trying to compare it to an apartment.", "Because I haven't seen any proof that he has the money he says, and he spends so much time around town just fucking off with his friends that I have a really hard time believing he's working.\n\nHe also only barely lives with us, regularly not coming home from friends couch surfing for days. I was convinced he was selling drugs a few months ago from his behavior and neat total lack of communication.", "So you don't believe anything your son says,  but it sounds like there are no previous lies to base your assumptions on.  He probably barely lives with you because his parents don't believe a word he says.  Can't blame the kid.  I hope the kids gets his truck and tells you to shove your assumptions about him."]}
