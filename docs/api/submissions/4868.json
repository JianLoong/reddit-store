At 7 months she's probably babbling more than actually referencing your mother as \"mama\" in a meaningful way. Also when they learn a new sound or word they apply it to everything at first. My toddler has called a bird and a TV \"Daddy\" today.", "It will change to their own special (gma) word. 7 month olds have no idea. It\u2019s just an easy common first word. Your mom understands this I\u2019m sure, my boys called most women \u201cmama\u201d originally. It makes you feel terrible but it\u2019s more than normal. Just start calling \u201cgma\u201d by that when in front of your daughter and it goes away. You probably call your mother a form of that word and they mimic you.", "So my kids 8, and sometimes he\u2019ll call me his step dads name. Sometimes he\u2019ll say mama instinctively. Depends on where he just was most recently. Chill out.", "Soft YTA \n\nBaby is mimicking sounds at this point, she\u2019s not doing it to hurt you and neither is your mom. \n\nThis sounds more like insecurity because you\u2019re away at work and school. You\u2019re only 7 months postpartum so you\u2019re probably extra sensitive right now.", "YTA at twelve months babies are doing well if they can say mama and dada to the right parents. At seven months your baby is babbling and to have done it for a few months? I call bull. I don't think that this is real.", "NTA what your mom said is not true, your daughter is simply getting use to names and pronouns. My kid called every man in my fam dad and every woman mom for a few weeks as she started to talk, we all needed to correct her so she could recognize the name.\n\nYour baby knows Yaya, so your mom has probably been teaching her to say mama instead of Yaya", "NTA. This is the first of many boundaries a parent can end up drawing over the course of their kiddos life. But first things first. You ARE caring for your child by going to school. You are basically planting your families future. And right now that looks like 10+ hour days, but just wait until it starts to bloom. \n\nAs for your mom, just calmly tell her that it hurts your feelings, and that even if she disagrees it is still true and that you'd like for her to refer to herself as Yaya.", "NAH, baby doesn\u2019t know and mum means well.

It's a reasonable request. I can see your mom's point of view that she takes care of the baby so it's normal for her to get the \"mama\" thing confused. That said, your mom could be saying \"I'm Yaya, silly baby!\", for example, before responding to what your baby wants. Kids confuse names a LOT (my 8yo calls me Dad and her sister's name a lot still), but there's no reason to go along with it.", "sorry, not to judge but your mom is 71?? she had you at 52??? goddamn that\u2019s crazy", "NTA, and maybe even NAH.

While I'm honored to fill that space in her life we still have to correct her to call me Uncle instead, and she's getting better all the time.\n\nNow is the time to correct this with your daughter because it will be harder to do as time goes by.  So you do need to ask that your mom correct your daughter, and make sure your mom is using the correct name when referring to herself around your daughter.", "YTA. \nI get that it must hurt, and it probably feeds into some insecurities you have about having to be gone so much, but remember its just a baby and its grandma bonding. You would hurt far more if they werent bonding, and you need to not step in their way.\n\nMy mom raised me in similar circumstances, and I am so grateful for my mom letting my grandma and grandpa bond with me.

Try to express that it hurts your feelings, you appreciate your mom's help and you wish you could be at home to be with your daughter, etc., but you're her mom, and as a mom herself, your mom should understand what a special thing that is. You're in the right, but if you come out guns ablazing at your mom, it won't go well I'm sure.", "ESH\n\nYour mom should try to help your daughter a little bit. It's early on though, so it's not going to sink in for awhile. As your daughter gets older, she'll start saying the right names to the right people. Your mom should, as a grandparent and just being a good helper, try to help your daughter understand she is not her mama, even though it is too early to really matter. It just sets a good precedent.\n\nYou should try to understand that your daughter is 7 months old and doesn't really understand what the word means to you. She says mama but to her it's just one of the words she says that always gets a reaction or praise. The kiddo doesn't know what it really means to anyone besides her. When she gets older, she will understand who is mom and who is grandma a lot better. \n\nYour bf is really validating you and your feelings, which is nice, and he probably does agree with you. \n\nFWIW, we had a hell of a time adjusting to the mom and dad names around grandparents. I would call my wife \"mom\" so our daughter knows who I'm talking to, but then my mom would answer. It gets confusing for the kiddos.", "NTA\n\nThat's a hard situation. I think it's a little weird that your mom is trying to claim motherhood and it seems pretty reasonable for you to ask her to go by nana, yaya, grandma, or whatever she likes. I hope your husband will support you and correct not your mom, but your daughter. Your'e probably not going to change your mom.\n\nKeep in mind that your daughter will start to figure things up on her own as she grows up. You might just have to live with it until she does.

When my grandson began to say mama, dads, etc I made it crystal clear that I\u2019m grandma. He calls me mama & I say, \u201cno, I\u2019m nonna. Say nonna.\u201d Your mom sounds like mine where she tried to displace me in my eldest child\u2019s life. Nip it in the bud.", "Time to take care of your own child. Or put her in daycare.", "Nta. But neither is gma! my 11 month old calls everyone mama, thats how you know he wants something! \n\nYou can talk to gma and tell her it makes you feel upset. Communication is always good! But you shouldn't expect it to change because baby won't understand anyways lol.", "NTA \n\nChildren don\u2019t call anyone anything without having been taught to do so. The fact that she started to call your mother mama means that \u2018someone\u2019 has been telling her to do so. \n\nThis might go further then your mother not correcting her, she might actually be teaching her to do so", "NTA You absolutely would not be out of line, but something tells me your mother won't listen to you.  What a selfish woman.\n\nAm not sure why your mother has a say in your daughter's daycare.  If you want the \"mama\" issue to stop, changing that situation might be a good place to start.", "Soft YTA. You mom takes care of your baby while you study.\n\nI get that it hurts you, but you need to suck it up. You baby is too young to understand what's going on, and you will have to get use to your kid showing love to other people.", "NTA. She had her chance to be called \"Mama\" when she raised you. Your baby's father is right: put her in her place. She is Yaya, NOT Mama. YOU are Mama.\n\nAlso, \"she didn't want her in infant daycare\". Who the fuck cares what SHE wants? Did your daughter come out of her body? No? Then she gets no say.\n\nYour mother is showing you the strings attached to taking care of your daughter. She is treating her like her do-over baby. Time to nip that shit in the bud, because it only *starts* with letting her call her \"mama\". Next thing you know, she's choosing your baby's first Christmas ornament, birthday outfit, etc., then she's training your kid to respect her over you, the *actual* mother.\n\nDon't believe me? r/JUSTNOMIL is full of stories with this exact pattern.\n\nPut your kid in daycare. The monetary costs are less than the costs of undoing the damage your mother could cause with undermining your parenting.", "NAH\n\nYou are completely within your right to feel sad or frustrated because your baby does not call you mama but rather tells your mother. However, your mother is not completely wrong either, sometimes babies say mom or dad who takes care of them the most and sees them with that paternal or maternal figure. Your baby doesn't do it on purpose. Do you spend little time with your baby? \n\nI recommend that you try to get your baby to call her yaya again instead of mama.", "NTA. I babysit a babbling baby three days a week who is constantly just making sounds that mean nothing yet. When he gets on a \u201cmamamama\u201d kick, I tell him mama loves him and will be back soon as a way to reinforce what that means. You might also consider baby sign language? As a side note, my mother is Yaya for my kids. :)", "Wow, seriously YTA.\n\nThe kid is 7 months old. She literally doesn't know differently and is responding to stimulus.

Your Mother Is Coaching Her. Kids don't just call whoever takes care of them mom. Kids use the words they are taught to use. If you had the baby nc wamted to be called godzilla and you and your partner always refered to you as godzilla your child would call you godzilla. Working at a daycare my managerwas chewed out by a parent for teaching a kid to call her sister sissy by saying things like do you miss sissy? Lets go get sissy, are you exited to see sissy later? Did you have a good weekend with sissy? All day at home your mother is saying to your daughger things like Mama loves you, Mama made lunch, do you wanna come cuddle Mama. YOUR MOTHER IS COACHING HER.", "YWNBTA. Babies learn the words they are taught, with the associations that are re-enforced for them. Mama isn't some magical word we're all born knowing. Yaya is teaching the baby that she is mama, and you have every right to be very upset by that when you are still in the picture and involved.", "Let me ask you something op. When you ask your mom not to respond to your baby and it has negatives effects on her, and trust me it will. What will you do then??\n\nIs being called mama more important than your baby's needs being met? Is being called mama more important than your baby being secure and happy? You mother ignoring your child isnt going to produce the results you want. If she's calling her mama because she think that's her mom, then suddenly mama stop responding, mama stop looking at her etc what then? Do you think she's going to crawl to you and calll you mama after that? No she won't. \n\nThere are other ways to get what you want and telling your mom not to respond is not it! \n\n1- see if you can cut your hours one day a week and spend that extra time with your daughter, I'm not saying you don't but it will help\n\n2- when you're home, both you and your mom should refer to you as mama. When she says mama and you're there let your mom point to you and say \"there's mama\".\n\n3- talk to your mother about the way you feel, a 7 month old is not going to automatically switch to calling you mama. All she's gonna know is that the person she calls mama is no longer her safe place. \n\n4- whenever you hear her say \"mama\" respond. Say yes here I am, say yes baby I'm right here. Go pick her up and say here's mama etc. \n\nLike I said there are many ways to do this without it having negative effects on the child. And she is what's most important here.\n\nN T A for feeling the way you feel, I understand that it hurts.

Do NOT ask your mother to stop responding to your baby - that would be cruel and counterproductive.\n\nThis \u201cproblem\u201d will soon go away on it\u2019s own as your baby\u2019s fine motor skills develop.  Some sounds are simply easier for baby to pronounce than other sounds, and the letter M is one of the easiest ones, along with B and P.  If you and your mother consistently use the \u201ccorrect\u201d names, then your baby will too as her language skills improve.  \n\nThe best way to help baby continue to develop her language is to talk to her a LOT.  It is also CRUCIAL that she receives lots of positive reinforcement whenever she babbles and tries to talk.  Praise her efforts, EVEN when she uses the wrong word.  Look at her and smile while you narrate what she is doing and what she wants.  \u201cBaby is crawling toward YaYa!  Does baby want YaYa?  Yes, she does!  Crawl toward YaYa!  Good girl!  Here\u2019s YaYa!  Whee!\u201d  \n\nBaby is not quite old enough to point, but you, your mom and baby can still play the \u201cwhere is\u201d game together.  \u201cBaby, where is YaYa?\u201d  (Wait for baby to look at YaYa.) \u201cYay!  There\u2019s YaYa!  You found YaYa!  Now where is MaMa, Baby Girl?\u201d  (Baby looks and smiles at you.)  \u201cThat\u2019s right, Mama\u2019s right here and she loves you!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve got this, OP.  Feel free to vent, and maybe check out Reddit \u201cmomforaminute\u201d when you need encouragement.", "WNBTA\n\nIt's early. \n\nRemind your mother.\n\nEvery. Single.

My 2 year old calls random strangers Papa.

She will know that you are her mom :)", "NTA. Baby is only 7 months old and this can change in the next few months, however your mom seems to be enjoying having her grandbaby refer to her as Mama a little too much from the description. My cousins and I used to call my grandma Mama when we were toddlers, we spent lots of time with my grandparents regularly. My grandmother sat us down and told us she was not our mother, and she was wonderful about it. We understood and that was that. When baby is a little older, they can have this explained in a nurturing/loving way. However, I still feel your mother should not be encouraging it. Your mother should also respect that boundary and be thankful that she has a daughter still going to school and working towards a bright future for herself and her grandbaby. She can enjoy being there for the both of you but imo, she needs to respect that you are the mother and she is the grandma! Point blank!", "I get why you\u2019re upset. But rest assured. Everyone is momma. Don\u2019t fret. She\u2019ll grow out of it eventually. And I do mean eveeeentuuuaaallly lol.

I have brought this up to my wife numerous times, they do it public and around my kids. One time my youngest called his grandpa \u201cDad\u201d because all his cousins were doing it. I quickly corrected him right in front my FIL. \u201c I am your dad , he is your abuelito.\u201d And I looked at my FIL so he would understand. There is only one Dad in my house for my kids.

It was a very important title. Only important people were called mom. \n\nI would say your mom needs to correct her, like when she says mama your mom should say Yaya is here!

Nice that she\u2019s watching your baby, but it\u2019s coming at an emotion cost for you.

I wonder whether grandma and mom is doing that or if grandma is also referring to herself as mama. I wonder because of what grandma said about the caregiver automatically being mama.

Is it possible that your daughter sees your mom as the umbrella person taking care of both of you?\n\nDo an audit. Do you do every feeding when you\u2019re home with baby? Do you respond to every nighttime waking? Every fall and scrape? Do you do every bath and bedtime?\n\nI\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t.

This may not at all become a situation, and in the best of circumstances, your child gets the benefit of multiple family members providing love and care.

She knew mama to be a woman who takes care of her and as others have said was just mimicking sounds at that point. She actually use to get quite frustrated and would even throw tantrums if I corrected her. While she is getting more advanced in her speech now, I try to correct her every time, but if she\u2019s running up to me while angry or sad with arms out yelling Mama, sometimes I just have to pick my battles and let mama go.
