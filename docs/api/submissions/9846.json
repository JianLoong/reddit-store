I am well aware of these and therefore tend to keep our interactions private.   I still love him and I have developed a system to keep him from fucking me over.  \n\nWhen my fiance asked me to marry him I said yes.  And then I went and privately told my dad about it.  We had a nice dinner with my fiance and that was that.  \n\nMy FMIL wanted to have an engagement party.  I was fine with it.  I just requested that she not invite my father.   I explained that we had a strained relationship and that I preferred to keep him at a distance.  She agreed.  \n\nI guess she thought she knew better than me.  She wanted to \"fix\" our relationship and the first step.was inviting him to her home for a party with alcohol.  \n\nWhen I met my dad for dinner I specifically chose a restaurant that didn't have a liquor license. And we went right after work.  His car has a breathalyzer built in to make it start.   I know what would happen otherwise. \n\nWhen I saw my dad there my stomach flipped.  I asked her what was going on and she said that a good daughter would want her dad there on this important day.  I asked her to please make him leave.  She said I was being rude.   I went over to my dad and asked him to leave.   He promised to behave.  He was so happy to be invited.  \n\nI told my fiance that I might need to leave in a hurry and he had to come with me when I left.  He knows the whole story.  He agreed.  \n\nMy father was fine at the beginning.  Then wine came around.  I glared at him and shook my head no.  He took some.  Then more. Then more.  \n\nHe started getting \"happy\". That doesn't last.  After dinner there were drinks.  As soon as I heard him raise his voice I asked my fiance to leave.  I faked a stomach problem and we left.  \n\nThe least embarrassing thing he did was piss himself and puke on the lawn.  \n\nMy FMIL is furious.  She said that we should have told her that my father has a drinking problem.  I said that it wouldn't have been a problem if she hadn't lied to my face about not inviting him.  \n\nMy father is humiliated that he did this.  I am just numb.  \n\nMy uncle has no problem controlling my dad. He is a cop and he has come to several events with my dad where he kept him from drinking.  My older brothers wedding for example.  \n\nBut he lives in another city.  He would have been at the wedding.  I'm just angry that she lied and I'm embarrassed and I'm venting here because I need someone to tell me I'm not the asshole for not wanting to tell people my father is like this.", "created_utc": 1676294399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11182dr/aita_for_letting_my_father_cause_a_huge_scene_at/", "score": 1751, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bottom line you told her not to, she has no excuse to be mad at you.", "NTA, it was none of your FMIL's business why you were strained with your father. She butted into something that was none of her business and is now blaming you for the fallout.

I hate when people try to force people to make up or assume inviting them to an event will magically make the relationship better.

Your future husband needs to sit her down and explain the situation and request that from now on she respect your wishes regarding your family and your wedding events. He needs to step up. I honestly believe you would be better off with a \u201cno contact\u201d policy with your father; but that\u2019s up to you.", "NTA but your MIL should be begging for forgiveness.

Only thing you could have done is tell your fmil about the drinking problem BUT that, as you pointed out, wouldn't have been a problem if she hadn't lied.\n\nYour father is TA for drinking even when you told him not to, and though your fmil was well-intentioned she is also TA", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to keep private family matters to yourself.

You said you didn\u2019t want him at the party. She said she wouldn\u2019t invite him. That should have been the end of the story.

Had she been honest about her intentions, then maybe you'd have seen fit to privately share that he has a drinking problem.

No, why then because someone shares dna should someone have to put up with abuse - that is what your dad is an abuser = not just of alcohol.

Try to involve her from time to time and keep putting up boundaries if she is chaosing. OR no shame in setting hard and fast boundaries.

You left your own party with an excuse instead of calling out lame behavior by adults who are supposed to be your parents. Those aren't boundaries. A boundary is like \"If you choose to drink tonight, I will leave immediately.\" A boundary is like, \"I asked you to not invite my dad and you agreed and then went behind my back to invite him.

It\u2019s absolutely a boundary. And actually a pretty amazing one for an adult child of an alcoholic. Calling someone out is not wrong, but it is not a boundary. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing about \u201ccalling out.\u201d If someone cares about about you and respects you but hurts you anyway because humans are clumsy, you don\u2019t call them out, you have a genuine conversation where you talk and listen. If someone tramples all over you by doing what you\u2019ve explicitly asked them not to do, you absent yourself from their presence and note that they\u2019ve shown you who they are. (People can change, people make mistakes sure, but the calling out remains unnecessary: they either are immediately mortified and apologetic, or the distance is all you need.)\n\nYou can absent yourself as confrontationally or non-confrontationally as feels right to you. \u201cOh HELL no!\u201d or \u201cI just remembered it\u2019s time to wash the dog!\u201d are both badass and both legit and both good ways to enforce boundaries.

I am going to take away and we can try and play with it again tomorrow.\" It makes it clear for my 2 year old that the \"punishment\" is actually a natural consequence resulting from behavior they chose. If I just swoop in and take it away without explanation, no learning is going to happen for my 2 year old. They won't be able to link their behavior with an undesirable consequence and their sole takeaway will be \"mom is mean.\" It seems like \"fixer\" FMIL hasn't had much pushback ever and probably steamrolls her whole family this way.\n\nI think dad is probably something of a lost cause and maybe FMIL is too, but I think a statement like the one I proposed is not a \"call out,\" as you say, it's a statement linking FMIL's actions with a natural consequence. For sure, leave by whatever means you need in order to regain a sense of safety, but FMIL now blames dad, FDIL, but clearly not herself. It's a breeding ground for resentment and tension for (if all goes well) the rest of her life. IDK. I feel like it would be worth a shot, because certainly this story won't be an isolated event.", "Honestly, having a 2 and 4 year old helped me a lot. It helped me understand why punishments don't work in the long run, why clear and consistent expectations set everyone up for success, and how my kids' worst behavior and my most hair-pully moments come when I have not held boundaries appropriately and compassionately. High expectations, high support to reach them.\n\nA lot harder to do with adults, though, especially when they're the adults that traumatized you as a kid."]}
