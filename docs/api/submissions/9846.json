I still love him and I have developed a system to keep him from fucking me over.  \n\nWhen my fiance asked me to marry him I said yes.  And then I went and privately told my dad about it.  We had a nice dinner with my fiance and that was that.  \n\nMy FMIL wanted to have an engagement party.  I was fine with it.  I just requested that she not invite my father.   I explained that we had a strained relationship and that I preferred to keep him at a distance.  She agreed.  \n\nI guess she thought she knew better than me.  She wanted to \"fix\" our relationship and the first step.was inviting him to her home for a party with alcohol.  \n\nWhen I met my dad for dinner I specifically chose a restaurant that didn't have a liquor license. And we went right after work.  His car has a breathalyzer built in to make it start.   I know what would happen otherwise. \n\nWhen I saw my dad there my stomach flipped.  I asked her what was going on and she said that a good daughter would want her dad there on this important day.  I asked her to please make him leave.  She said I was being rude.   I went over to my dad and asked him to leave.   He promised to behave.  He was so happy to be invited.  \n\nI told my fiance that I might need to leave in a hurry and he had to come with me when I left.  He knows the whole story.  He agreed.  \n\nMy father was fine at the beginning.  Then wine came around.  I glared at him and shook my head no.  He took some.  Then more. Then more.  \n\nHe started getting \"happy\". That doesn't last.  After dinner there were drinks.  As soon as I heard him raise his voice I asked my fiance to leave.  I faked a stomach problem and we left.  \n\nThe least embarrassing thing he did was piss himself and puke on the lawn.  \n\nMy FMIL is furious.  She said that we should have told her that my father has a drinking problem.  I said that it wouldn't have been a problem if she hadn't lied to my face about not inviting him.  \n\nMy father is humiliated that he did this.  I am just numb.  \n\nMy uncle has no problem controlling my dad. He is a cop and he has come to several events with my dad where he kept him from drinking.  My older brothers wedding for example.  \n\nBut he lives in another city.  He would have been at the wedding.  I'm just angry that she lied and I'm embarrassed and I'm venting here because I need someone to tell me I'm not the asshole for not wanting to tell people my father is like this.", "created_utc": 1676294399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11182dr/aita_for_letting_my_father_cause_a_huge_scene_at/", "score": 330, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your future husband needs to sit her down and explain the situation and request that from now on she respect your wishes regarding your family and your wedding events. He needs to step up.

Only thing you could have done is tell your fmil about the drinking problem BUT that, as you pointed out, wouldn't have been a problem if she hadn't lied.\n\nYour father is TA for drinking even when you told him not to, and though your fmil was well-intentioned she is also TA", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to keep private family matters to yourself.

OPs relationship and struggles with her father are her business and if she doesn\u2019t want to go around to everyone telling them her father is a belligerent alcoholic she doesn\u2019t have to. and honestly, she was right not to because MIL is clearly untrustworthy. This is 100% on MIL. SHE wanted to through the party, SHE promised to not invite the father, SHE decided she knew OP\u2019s needs better than her, SHE invited the father behind OPs back and sprung it on her at the party. It must be incredibly taxing to have a close relative like this, OP needs to take care of her own emotional needs. Hopefully MIL learned a lesson about sticking her nose in other peoples business.\n\nOP you are NTA is is completely reasonable to not want to divulge to people your father has this problem. You take care of you.", "they don\u2019t need to know the reason. bottom line, she requested that her father not be invited and they did it anyway \n\nshe\u2019s not the ah here", "Their strained relationship is likely the product of more than just him being an alcoholic... For instance he doesn't learn his lesson (see interlock), doesn't mitigate harm or risk to himself or others (see interlock), doesn't prioritize his kids or show up for them... It's not just the drinking that has likely strained their relationship.", "I might have if she hadn't promised not to invite him.", "Nope FMIL should've just listened. She didn't, and lied, and was rightfully embarrassed.", "I completely disagree. No, she didn't need that information. What if the reason wasn't alcoholism, which is bad enough as it is, but what if it was abuse etc, would OP have to divulge all then? FMIL shouldn't have interfered in the first place.", "Why did she need to know?  He wasn't supposed to be there.", "Her dads alcoholism was none of mil business. She fafo and learned to abide bt dil,s wishes or get a nasty surprise.", "OP had no responsibility to divulge that information, and MIL had no right to demand to be told.\n\nMIL is TA for doing the \u201cI know what\u2019s best\u201d bullshit.", ">And she's right. You could have told her this when you asked her to make him leave.\n\nWhy should she have had to? OP told her not to invite him in the first place. MIL didn't liaten to that, so why would she have listened to OP then? Also, if MIL wants to disrespect someone else's boundaries, she can deal with the consequences. She's responsible for the guests she invites to her house.", "i foresee a future where FMIL will believe she knows better then OP and try to have her (FMIL) way every single time. I hope FH has a shiny backbone to deal with his mom.", "Like I said she thought she was doing something good, obviously overstepped, found out why OP told her not to, then got pissed at OP for not telling her. This isn't about adult children, OP is the adult child in this situation. It's the parents that are the problem.", "So giving CPR means nothing unless they survive? Why even try, unless you're 100% sure of the outcome.", "Yeah same if I was organising a party for someone I care about and they asked me not to invite someone because of a strained relationship I would not invite that person. Far too many people seem to believe they know better than the person whose life they are interfering with.", "The only reason why I say come clean with it.  My step-dad is a major, violent alcoholic.  When he drinks, he is the fun, awesome person in front of everyone  else, but when we get home, he beat the crap out of my mother.  Religiously.  She chose him over my sister and I.  This cycle continued and continued. Therefore, we would always let everyone know.  Yes, it is her right to keep it private.  However, in my experience, it worked better to explain the issue.  I'm just giving a different perspective.", "All of these are major symptoms of alcoholism and dependency.", "There are a lot of things that need to happen. One you need to tell FMIL she needs to earn your trust again.  Letting her think she did nothing wrong will only bode poorly for the future \nTwo. Fiance needs to get on that page. If he isn't already.\nThree. I think you need a new system for handling your dad. It only works in situations you control and I'm sorry but you won't control all situations.\n\nYou are definitely not the asshole but for your own sake please do these things.", "I absolutely understand that.  My thought was that, if she knew the full extent of his habitual drunken madness, she may have chosen not to invite him.  Perhaps she had no clue of the enormity of the potential for the celebration to end like this.", "Doesn\u2019t change the fact that he was there. She made a decision to \u201chelp\u201d by interfering. That was not a great decision. She wasn\u2019t trying to embarrass you, your fianc\u00e9, your Dad. She just didn\u2019t have enough information to make a thoughtful decision. Once he was in her home the responsibility was yours to either control your father or tell her what was going on. Was that fair, no. But it is what it is. You can hold her accountable for disrespecting your request but other than that... I think everyone made mistakes here. Mistakes happen. Learn from them & then move on.", "Let\u2019s hope she also has an iron fist, to rule over the situation with", "I just said adult children do not need to justify to people why their parents are not in their lives. OP is the adult child and should not have had to tel fmil any extra I go or had to justify why her father was not invited. When an adult says no, people need to take Jonas an answer. I\u2019m not sure you read what I wrote. At no point was mil doing anything nice or can justify her intentions. Going against and adult who says \u201cdo not invite my parent to this important event\u201d is not doing something with good intentions. What she was doing was pushy and selfish from the beginning.", "Apples and oranges. These two things are not the same and can't be compared.", "I'm really sorry that happened to you. I hope you're in a much better phase of your life now. Our opinions are always formed from our experiences, it just seems our mechanisms for dealing with things are different - my comments weren't meant to invalidate your experience. I'm nc with my Dad now, but I don't bother to explain my feelings or reasons to anyone anymore, the times that I have would just re- traumatize me and it takes ages for me to get back to being me again, so as far as I'm concerned no one needs to know, the clear boundaries I set should be respected, as I would respect others.", "Yup they are but alcoholism isn't the only problem in their relationship. The impact of alcoholism and his history that influences his belligerent drunkenness a absolutely are contributing factors. Rarely are there not contextual factors in substance misuse especially when the price of substance use is very high.\n\nThere are so many people who struggle with drinking. And there are so many people who consider themselves casual drinkers when they definitely are not. There is no mistaking his drinking as casual and he as not and does not appear to be considering reducing his use or his risks... And that does make him an AH. He is responsible for his actions even if he has a medical condition (which substance use disorder is). \n\nThe OP has developed a whole 'system to keep him from fucking me over'... And that's about a lot of shit.", "Chances are, FMIL would have decided OP was exaggerating the problem, and invited him anyway.", "It shouldn\u2019t matter why she didn\u2019t want him there. She didn\u2019t want him there. FMIL massively overstepped and then had the nerve to place the blame elsewhere when it blew up in her face.", "People who are willing to stomp boundaries for their ideas of \"faaaaaaaamily\" don't care about the reasons for the boundaries they stomp. OP telling FMIL a reason wouldn't have changed anything, and no part of this is OP's fault. NTA", "OP didn't want to invite him, that's reason enough. MIL doesn't need to know the ins and out of their relationship.\n\nShe should trust that if OP didn't want her father there it was for good reason.", "It is not on OP in the slightest. FMIL made that decision BEHIND THEIR BACK, AGAINST THEIR WISHES. No way that's on OP. You don't need more info when someone says not to invite someone. Just don't. I would have told FMIL good luck and bounced before the wine. Op is not her father's keeper. That's on him and the person who disrespectfully invited him", "The problem with that is it wasn't her decision to make.", "> She just didn\u2019t have enough information to make a thoughtful decision.\n\nYes she did. She was asked not to invite him and agreed to that. That was all the information needed.", "I am in a lot better place and phase now.  I did the sane nc with my mom, step-dad and their daughter they had together.  Sometimes you just grow away from toxic people.  \nI agree with you on the boundaries.  I guess my sister and I NEEDED everyone's help growing up and even after to ensure they wouldn't give him alcohol ever so that is why we chose to tell it.", "Absolutely.  I lived through it for years.  The behaviors they exhibit while they are using become the reality of who they are when they are not using.  My step-dad could apologize his face off the next day for beating my mother, but it never changed our opinion of how terrible a person he is.  My mother died two years ago.  He tried to hug me at her funeral.  There was no way in hell that man was touching me.", "I'm so sorry you experienced all of that. It's freaking horrible. I wouldn't expect you to disclose that information to anyone who has already promised they won't invite him to your celebrations.", "I've just always been open about it. I think that was part of the strength that I found from it.  These issues were his issues.  As embarrassing as it was to tell, I wanted people to know why I didn't want him around...and if he did come around...NO ALCOHOL!!!  They did help to protect my sister and i...and of course our mother...by listening.  \nAs I said though, in this situation for OP, I don't think they are an AH.  I just have a different experience.", "Legit and respected."]}
