I am well aware of these and therefore tend to keep our interactions private.   I still love him and I have developed a system to keep him from fucking me over.  \n\nWhen my fiance asked me to marry him I said yes.  And then I went and privately told my dad about it.  We had a nice dinner with my fiance and that was that.  \n\nMy FMIL wanted to have an engagement party.  I was fine with it.  I just requested that she not invite my father.   I explained that we had a strained relationship and that I preferred to keep him at a distance.  She agreed.  \n\nI guess she thought she knew better than me.  She wanted to \"fix\" our relationship and the first step.was inviting him to her home for a party with alcohol.  \n\nWhen I met my dad for dinner I specifically chose a restaurant that didn't have a liquor license. And we went right after work.  His car has a breathalyzer built in to make it start.   I know what would happen otherwise. \n\nWhen I saw my dad there my stomach flipped.  I asked her what was going on and she said that a good daughter would want her dad there on this important day.  I asked her to please make him leave.  She said I was being rude.   I went over to my dad and asked him to leave.   He promised to behave.  He was so happy to be invited.  \n\nI told my fiance that I might need to leave in a hurry and he had to come with me when I left.  He knows the whole story.  He agreed.  \n\nMy father was fine at the beginning.  Then wine came around.  I glared at him and shook my head no.  He took some.  Then more. Then more.  \n\nHe started getting \"happy\". That doesn't last.  After dinner there were drinks.  As soon as I heard him raise his voice I asked my fiance to leave.  I faked a stomach problem and we left.  \n\nThe least embarrassing thing he did was piss himself and puke on the lawn.  \n\nMy FMIL is furious.  She said that we should have told her that my father has a drinking problem.  I said that it wouldn't have been a problem if she hadn't lied to my face about not inviting him.  \n\nMy father is humiliated that he did this.  I am just numb.  \n\nMy uncle has no problem controlling my dad. He is a cop and he has come to several events with my dad where he kept him from drinking.  My older brothers wedding for example.  \n\nBut he lives in another city.  He would have been at the wedding.  I'm just angry that she lied and I'm embarrassed and I'm venting here because I need someone to tell me I'm not the asshole for not wanting to tell people my father is like this.", "created_utc": 1676294399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11182dr/aita_for_letting_my_father_cause_a_huge_scene_at/", "score": 8324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your future husband needs to sit her down and explain the situation and request that from now on she respect your wishes regarding your family and your wedding events. He needs to step up.

Only thing you could have done is tell your fmil about the drinking problem BUT that, as you pointed out, wouldn't have been a problem if she hadn't lied.\n\nYour father is TA for drinking even when you told him not to, and though your fmil was well-intentioned she is also TA", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to keep private family matters to yourself.

We had a strained relationship when I was in high school (really most of my life), and I invited him to my high school graduation with the condition that he not drink that day for the ceremony (a 2-3 hr affair pretty early in the day) and for the whole visit (2 days total). \n\nHe promised, though was openly grumpy about it because he \"doesn't have a problem.\" Yeah, he showed up drunk anyway and was extremely embarrassing the entire time. \n\nI always wondered what would happen when I got married, if I'd allow him to walk me down the aisle, if I even wanted him there at all, because no one would babysit him like your uncle would. It sounds bad, but I think the universe did me a mercy in him dying before it happened so I never had to have that war with myself. \n\nAnyway, I wish you luck. Your FMIL found out why, and I wouldn't be apologetic about it no matter what.

But instead she just went and did what she wanted.\n\nI am so sorry. \n\nHere look -- there's a lot to be said for treating substance abuse as a *disease*, as a health problem. Think of another illness or disability that causes people to lose control -- an epileptic having a seizure for instance, or an autistic person screaming from sensory overload. You describe (loosely) your father's behavior and I see 1. someone who lacks control due to illness and 2. who was optimistically hoping he *wouldn't* lose control this time, because he's been taught to see it as a character defect that he *should* be able to control and not an illness that he can manage with adequate support. Ideally he would have recognized his limits and not expected himself to be able to behave well around alcohol. He didn't. It is what it is.\n\nAnd I can tell there's a *whole lot* of repeated horrible experiences throughout your life that you're not mentioning here.\n\nThis is not your fault.

I do think MIL is getting a pass if she's not made aware of the real reason OP left  (i.e. you messed up, Ma, and this is what you get). A person who \"fixes\" to such a ridiculous level has likely gone unchecked with this sort of thing for a long time. I am only saying this is a chance to set a new tone or get trampled for years to come.\n\n**Edited to ask**: I am genuinely curious about the difference between teaching people how to treat you and \"parenting\" them. I feel like if you don't name the behavior that was upsetting or over the line and give it a consequence, there are only two options: that person will continue doing as they were and you will eventually have to learn to eat it because they're your MIL and (possibly) grandma to your kids OR 2) that person will continue on and you cut them off, which also seems non-ideal.\n\nWhen my dad was in in-home hospice, I was trying to deal with my mom's own medical issues (she was inpatient with sepsis) and parenting a 1 year old and 3 year old. My dad would bark a request (he was only semi-mobile), my 3 year old was tearing the place apart and my 1 year old was wailing. That trip I (41f) taught my dad (71m) to say \"thank you\" when I brought him things. Like, WTF? How did he make it this far with no pleases and no thank yous. You could say I was parenting him, but I will say, he never forgot after that and it made the whole situation a modicum more pleasant. \n\nIf we don't teach people how to treat us, do we just discard all the people when they disappoint us? I definitely do this with friendships because at some point the effort just isn't worth it, but I guess with family stuff the drive to make it work better than it worked before seems higher to me.", "Honestly it doesn't even need to be some kind of extreme trauma, alcoholism can be genetic.\nIt's an insidious thing that often builds up slowly over time and all of a sudden you find yourself dependent on alcohol.\nThere is a good reason alcoholism is classified as a disease now, because it very much is one.\n\nEven people who manage to recover still struggle with it. I have met people with decades of sobriety who still avoid any situation where alcohol is involved, because when you have the disease It's not a matter of \"boundary setting\" or self-control. It's a fight for your life. As soon as an alcoholic gets one drink in all logic and reason goes out the window. Your brain will give you all sorts of excuses and tell all sorts of lies to get you to drink more.\n\nI applaud OP for handling things the way that she does. Her father is not her responsibility to control. She clearly understands his alcoholism and knows that the only way to have a reasonable time with him is to be in an alcohol-free environment.\n\nEven if she told him something along the lines of \"If you have a drink I'm leaving.\" That probably wouldn't have accomplished anything, he has a disease he's not a misbehaving child. The only way he'll ever be close to normal is if he gets help. Recovery is possible but it is *extremely* difficult and requires constant vigilance. No one can force you to recover either, it has to be 100% of her father's own will in order for it to work.\n\nI get that it can be hard for normal people with no experience with alcoholism/alcoholics to understand. I think part of the problem is how much we throw around the word \"addicted\" now-a-days when what we really mean is \"I really love this thing.\"\n\nEdit: just in case someone reads this and decides they want to get sober, please seek medical help. Detoxing from alcohol after a long period of abuse is dangerous and can be deadly if you try to do it on your own. A safe detox requires a doctor's supervision and careful administration of certain drugs to prevent severe complications.", "I don\u2019t think they meant that the person was a lost cause, but that your one thousandth heartfelt \u201cyou really hurt my feelings\u201d convo with a person in the throes of addiction is not gonna be useful. The person with the addiction has to decide to change and treatment has to be available. \n\nIn another relationship, where both people have the capacity to listen to each other, good communication can be more useful. Telling someone that they hurt you could actually change the relationship.", "You're glad you're not in my family? Rad, me too. \n\nThe way I talked about trying to break a cycle of intergenerational trauma in my own family by treating my kids like people seems to have really triggered something in you. \n\nWe literally said the same things in our posts, but you started with a truly horrible thing about my own person family. You don't know shit about me or my relationship to my parents or my children. My dad endured horrible trauma also-- a sibling that died, one who died by suicide, witnessing DV to the point of near death several times, an alcoholic dad, countless beatings, corporal punishment in an all boys Episcopalian school, extreme poverty, undiagnosed learning disability etc. \n\nI actually never wrote my dad off and continued to build a relationship with him and teach him--literally step-by-step-- how to treat my children. I held his hand and played him his favorite song on his death bed, having done copious therapy and EMDR to process the pain he inflicted on me when I was a child. It took me a long time to be able to hold both the hard life he survived *and the fact that I was a child who deserved a better father.* Being able to carry all of that is probably the most Herculean task of a lifetime, and it allowed me to tell the scared little girl inside of me that she was ok and I got her now. That, in turn, allowed me to be open to creating a new future with him when I had made a really black and white boundary decades before.  \n\nMaybe sit with the thing that triggered you for a second, rather than lobbing a personal insult at someone.

I feel like instead of op having to be the one to confront the MIL about this, her fianc\u00e9  should have stepped up and dealt with his own mother stomping his wife\u2019s boundaries.\n\nI\u2019m getting narcissist vibes from her disrespect, cruelty, superiority, and lack of accountability/empathy/boundaries, and I\u2019m guessing this is neither the first nor last time op has to deal with this overbearing woman and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s washing his hands of it.", "It doesn\u2019t even seem like they\u2019re *estranged*.

You left your own party with an excuse instead of calling out lame behavior by adults who are supposed to be your parents. Those aren't boundaries. A boundary is like \"If you choose to drink tonight, I will leave immediately.\" A boundary is like, \"I asked you to not invite my dad and you agreed and then went behind my back to invite him. I am going to leave now. I will be so sorry to miss this party. Thank you for putting together what looks like a lovely dinner. Lets chat tomorrow.\"\n\nFurthermore, \"calling them out\", while viscerally satisfying, usually does no good. You can make the argument that someone sensitive to and capable of feeling shamed or embarassed by being called out probably would be the same type of person to not do something like this.\n\nPeople like this who feel they \"know better than you\" on how your life should run or what is right or not are either clueless, or completely *don't give a fuck* about your boundaries or your admonitions or call-outs--therefore, it's a worthless endeavor to do so if the object is to shame them into better behavior, or merely to make them feel bad. \n\nThey are either too clueless, or to hard-headed to do so.", "Agree. At some point you learn to remove yourself from the influence of an alcoholic because no amount if calling out changes anything.  OP has learnt not to engage because it's clearly futile. Sometimes you have to detach to protect yourself. Yay for fiancee for supporting without question.", "Given MIL already crossed the line inviting dad, OP could have gotten in MIL's face and said, \"When this blows up you WILL admit it's all your doing, right?

She had to clean up after the consequences of her own behaviour, and now she understands that OP is a good daughter with justification for keeping her father at arm's length.", "I think the fact that he supported op in handling the situation the way she felt most comfortable is probably more important, in this instance, than what he said to his mom. Which, tbh, in his position I\u2019d probably at least open that conversation privately since OP clearly had already had a large stressor dropped on her with no warning without FMIL and husband arguing about it- it\u2019d be nice to know what exactly he said, but I don\u2019t think it affects the verdict.", "By the gods, I *really* want the answer to this.", "It is definitely a difficult situation and I'm glad to see responses with this much nuance. Imo, it's impossible to really say what \"should\" be done in these situations because it's all so individual and it's really up to the individual to determine whether they want to try to work on these things while knowing that it might not work or despite the obstacles. Nothing is really \"reasonable\" or \"unreasonable\" because the answer is that it's all kind of \"unreasonable\" to have to teach grown people how not to be assholes. We can talk all day about how people \"should\" know better, \"should\" be more well adjusted, \"should\" not be an asshole, but at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is whether or not you can and want to put in the effort despite the pain and frustration that will come. \n\nI think it's a common mistake to place too much emphasis on the outcome, on the idea that people will be able to change and be better, because I think you never really can know the future like that, even when all signs might want to lead you to a conclusion. People are pretty fucking absurd, and someone you think will never change might become a great person and someone you trust might betray you. Imo, the only way to truly move forward without regret is to accept whatever outcomes that might come right off the bat, and decide whether you want to give it a shot anyways even if it's all a waste of time. To see all of this clearly as a leap of faith where you want to try your best is the only healthy way to keep going and not become burdened by disappointments, resentment, and distorted views of the world.\n\nSo yeah, with people I generally go, I'll give it my best to give them the benefit of the doubt for as long as I can. But I also accept myself as a human being and not a saint, so I know that I have my limits and that they're just my limits, not anything innately \"reasonable\" or \"justifiable\". I don't see people I walk away from or dislike as irredeemable, and I don't try to rationalize the people who I keep trying to interact with as being inherently worthier. It's defs something I struggle with sometimes, cause man I find a lot of people frustrating af lol, but I think any other perspective could take me down authoritarian/controlling/self-aggrandizing roads that are very common but that I'd rather steer clear of if I can.", "lots of disingenuous relationship forcing attempts in AITA these days."]}
