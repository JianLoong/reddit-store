Sarah got married five years ago, Adam got married four years ago.  Sarah and her husband Joey (38M) have been trying for kids since they got married but got delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, and they are now going through IVF.  Adam and his wife Clarissa (32F) put off having kids for a couple of years while Adam was in med school, but then started trying for kids.  It's been really hard for Sarah and Joey to have kids, and there've been several complications, but things are now back on track.  However, due to the length of time it's taking, Sarah is becoming more and more depressed.  We're trying to support her, but there's only so much we can do.  The doctors haven't told her she can't have kids, but it's getting less and less likely as she grows older.\n\nAdam and Clarissa recently found out that they're expecting a child, much to their (and our) excitement.  However, they're hesitating about how to tell Sarah.  Adam really looks up to his older sister - they're very close, as my wife and I worked a lot when they were younger and my kids only had each other for a while.  Adam didn't want to cause his sister more emotional distress, but he wanted to tell her before Clarissa became very pregnant.  Adam decided to just call Sarah and tell her directly, and from what he told us later, she did not take it well... at all.  She wished him a perfunctory 'congratulations', and has been incommunicado since then.  We tried to respect her privacy while she processed this, but eventually I had had enough.  Adam's upset that his sister isn't happy for him, Clarissa is hurt that her sister-in-law isn't supportive, and my wife misses her daughter.  \n\nEventually I called Sarah, got her voicemail, and left her a very angry message telling her that even if she can't have kids, she should be happy for her brother and that she can at least be an aunt.  Sarah sent me one angry text message with a lot of expletives and told me not to contact her again.  When I showed this to my wife, she got upset at me and said that I should've worded the text nicer, but I said that infertility isn't an excuse for rude behavior.\n\nSo, AITA for this text and my attitude towards my daughter?", "created_utc": 1694109556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cm5vf/aita_for_a_text_message_i_sent_to_my_potentially/", "score": 3634, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can understand talking to her but you were very much so not empathetic and your execution was terrible. She is probably processing a lot, getting older, being infertile (potentially), and trying to be happy for her brother. I am sure deep down she is happy for him. She is probably mad at herself for not being as supportive as she wants to be.\n\nIt isn't something you will really ever understand, you have two kids.", "YTA\n\n>she did not take it well... at all. She wished him a perfunctory 'congratulations', and has been incommunicado since then. \n\nShe took it just fine. She wished them congratulations and went to process her feelings by herself without projecting them at her brother. You want something unreasonable from her - she's not obliged to get excited or not be sad..", "\u201cWe tried to respect her privacy while she processed this\u201d.   What does that mean.  You left her alone, didn\u2019t call?  Or you reached out here and there, asked if there was anything we could help with. \n\nBecause she can\u2019t get pregnant. Then brother gets pregnant and suddenly no one is calling her. She may have asked her brother for time, but did she ask it from you?  Did she ask for time from your wife?  \n\nIf the first time you reach out to her after knowing she got the news it to yell at her, YTA. \n\nNot being able to get pregnant can be a lot like a miscarriage. Coming to terms with not being a mom. Coming to terms with never feeling a baby move inside you. Coming to terms with the picture you have in your head will never be. And now she is coming to terms with her brother getting his happily ever after. That you and your wife will get your happily ever after with grandkids that aren\u2019t hers. That while she might be a part of that picture it will be more of a spectator role than active participant. \n\nThere is a lot of hurt involved. The feeling your body betrayed you. Questioning why not you when everyone else can finally get pregnant and you can\u2019t. If there have been fertility treatments, the money you wasted that you\u2019ll never get back.\nIt\u2019s a grieving process and it takes time. And the fact that you yelled at her that other people\u2019s feelings are more important than her mental health. Congratulations you just threw more guilt and shame and feeling of inadequacy into that pile. \n\nDid I mention YTA!", ">even if she can't have kids, she should be happy for her brother and that she can at least be an aunt.\n\n\nOoooh boy.  You really should have minded your own business.  Cause this statement is amazingly tone deaf.\n\nYTA.", "Gee I don\u2019t know why yelling at her didn\u2019t work /s YTA. There are kind ways to help and then there is what you did. You could have said \u201cWe understand this is hard for you but we miss you. Please stop by\u201d and then you could have a KIND conversation with her in person about asking if she thinks she can be around the baby and offer any support including attending therapy with her. You made it worse.", "Your daughter is having a difficult time trying to conceive. For YEARS..\n\nAnd at a time when it'll be more and more likely that she'll NEVER conceive, without even really trying her brother and SIL are expecting.\n\nShe's grieving, she's depressed, and for her own mental sanity she took herself away from it all to come to terms with this on her own.\n\n*<Adam's upset that his sister isn't happy for him, Clarissa is hurt that her sister-in-law isn't supportive, and my wife misses her daughter.>*\n\nAnd instead of respecting your daughter's space, you decided that HER feelings are NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL compared to the feelings of the happy expecting couple and future grandma.\n\nINFO: How are your daughter's feelings \"rude behavior\"?\n\nWasn't it rude of you to blatantly ignore her feelings and calling her out for not accepting she can't have kids (INFO ; Was the \"can't have kids\" already medically confirmed?) and not be chearing with the rest of the family?\n\nLooking forwards to your REDDIT post asking us how to FIX this.\n\nAnswer: No idea, that was a truly awful, inconsiderate and sh\\*tty thing you did....\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYour wife was right to get upset at you.\n\nWay to kick a person when they're down.", "YTA. You should have kept out of it. You're playing favorites.", "YTA.  When you called her, you should have shown compassion to your daughter by saying you know her brother told her that they were expecting, that you love her, and if she wants to talk, you are there for her.  Instead, you bulldozed in and yelled at her.  Why would you even do that?", "OP you know you are, why even ask, YTA.  \n\nInfertility is painful for women who are experiencing it.  It hurts to see others have babies and they still don't.  I just can't imagine why you would think yelling at your adult depressed daughter would do anything to help.  \n\nLook, I was your daughter in law, I had six babies total, I started younger, it was easy for me.  My sister-in-law worked on her career and married in her 40s, she wanted a child, she became pregnant, and I became pregnant at the same time, sadly she miscarried.  I have a child the same age Her's would have been.  She was polite to us at family gatherings for a while but never the same.  To make it worse, I became pregnant AGAIN a few years later.  I didn't want to tell her at all, I felt bad.  When she found out it was full no contact, not just for her but she got my mother-in-law and my other sister-in-law to also go no contact.  It crushed my husband at the time.  about ten years later, mother-in-law died, and the funeral was the first time they met my youngest son.  Obviously, mother-in-law never met him, they didn't even know he was a boy.   The damage was done already, and we still stayed very low contact with them to this day.  They showed up for a couple of my kid's graduations.  I think my children (now adults) go see them on occasion, but it's still just casually polite.  Nothing like the super close family we were.  My youngest kids don't remember their grandma on that side, my older kids barely remember her.\n\nYou may have damaged this beyond repair, but you need to send your daughter flowers and beg forgiveness, before you never see her again.", "YTA. I get what you were going for, and your instincts to try to talk to Sarah weren't horrible, but you went about it in an incredibly rude way.\n\nYou left her an angry voicemail message? Why? Did you think that would accomplish anything besides hurting her more?", "Oh my. YTA.\n\nYou don't get to decide when and how someone else processes their grief! Are you serious? That was so sadly insensitive as a parent. You owe her some massive apologies. I don't know if you can ever make this right, but you better start groveling now. You showed a complete lack of empathy for someone you claim you love.", "Yta  100%", "YTA you made things worse!!!", "YTA. Don\u2019t have meaningful conversations with your kids about sensitive topics over text.", "Big YTA.  Your daughter is obviously struggling hard with this and instead of being supportive you attack her for being depressed.", "Edit to add: YTA You are right infertility is not an excuse for bad behaviour so why did you send that text (edit: sorry voicemail) ? Do you send newly grieving widows texts/voicemail saying that they are being selfish in not rejoicing in marriages and should expect to share the husband?\n\nYour daughter is barren. She wants to have children and can't. She is grieving the ability to have a child, watch them grow up, go to school, graduate, move out, a whole host of milestones. She is likely feeling influenced by the societal pressure that is woman must have baby and feeling a failure. Her perception of self has been rocked. \n\nShe didn't scream at them. She didn't try to make it about herself. She congratulated them and then withdrew to process it all. I am sorry your brother and SIL wants their sister to be joyful but they have the rest of the family to share with. Why don't they have the grace to drop what they want from your daughter and give her what she needs? Peace to come to terms with her loss. \n\nAnd you wade into this rawness saying she needs to put it all behind her. I mean she might be allowed to play with her sister's baby. That's good enough isn't it?", "YTA. This news hit so close to home for your daughter, and put into her face what she might never be able to have. Instead of giving her time to get used to the news, you decided that you\u2019d rather berate her, piling more on her head in what\u2019s clearly a difficult time. Your response to your wife that \u201cinfertility is no excuse for rude behavior,\u201d you proved that you don\u2019t actually have any compassion for what she\u2019s been going through. She\u2019s absolutely right to go NC, because you proved that she can\u2019t actually rely on your support when the going gets tough. You are absolutely TA here.", "Oooh boy.  Massive YTA.  Look, I understand your wanting to talk to your daughter about this, and you want Adam to feel that his sister's happy for him and Clarissa, but this isn't the kind of thing you can force.  Sarah's going through a profoundly painful process where her younger brother is going to have a kid before her, and she's facing the possibility that she won't have any biological kids of her own.  She's going to need time to cope with this.  The best you can do is to continually let her know that you're there to support her.  \n\nAlso, being an aunt isn't the same thing as being a mother.  All it means is that there's a constant reminder that her brother had a kid and she hasn't (yet, hopefully).", "YTA. I agree that Sarah should not have been upset with her brother or cut him off since he didn't do anything wrong. You nonetheless skipped dozens of steps and went straight to berating her when common sense would tell you to start off asking how she's doing and sensing her time from there.", "Yta. Very obviously. Why is everyone mad at her for not immediately being happy. You are not entitled to her support as soon as you want it. Let her take time. If her brother and sil want her support isn't it normal then they should also support her by giving her time to adjust. She may have fertility issues or even her husband can have fertility issues. But you were quick to blame her for something she has no control over and something that already hurts her. Not the actions of a father who loves his daughter. I would go NC if my dad ever did this to me.", "YTA - So your daughter is struggling with fertility, she didn't react to the news of her SILs pregnancy with enough exhilaration for you, and she's been taking time to sort herself out. \n\nAnd instead of being sympathetic and offering her support when she's probably feeling like even more of a failure, you decided the best course of action was to leave her \"a very angry message\" that rubs it in her face that she can't be a mom but her SIL can, and as a consolation prize, she can spend time with everyone else's kids.  \n\nDad of the year right here folks!! (And since it's very clear that you don't understand nuance, I want to point out that the dad of the year comment was me being sarcastic.)", "Wait, did you leave her a voice mail or did you text her? Because your post is ambiguous.\n\nEither way, YTA all the way. You can't dictate Sarah's emotional reaction to the news. You told her how she should feel, and that's just wrong. Your wife was missing her, and now you've thrown up a huge obstacle to Sarah reconciling with your wife and with Adam just through your interference.\n\nThe only way to handle such a delicate situation is to be understanding and accepting of her and her feelings and be careful not to rub her face in Adam's good fortune. You missed that mark by a really long distance.", "YTA.  Honestly, you don\u2019t get to tell Sarah how to feel.", "YTA - being an insensitive buttinski isn't an excuse for rude behavior either.\n\nManaging your adult son's relationship with your adult daughter is not your business.   You should have tried harder at respecting her privacy.    \n\nYour angry message was unwarranted, counterproductive and stupid and you should apologize.   What right do you have to even be angry?", "YTA not just for how you worded the text, but why you sent it in the first place.\n\n>Adam's upset that his sister isn't happy for him, Clarissa is hurt that her sister-in-law isn't supportive, and my wife misses her daughter.\n\nYour daughter is spending tens of thousands of dollars and putting her body through who knows what to have a child, but you only see how it is affecting everyone else.\n\n>even if she can't have kids, she should be happy for her brother and that she can at least be an aunt.\n\nBy saying this, you\u2019re basically demanding that she accept something that\u2019s not decided yet. There may come a time when she needs to accept that she won\u2019t have a child, but not on your schedule.\n\nSo the end result is you basically told her to accept she won\u2019t have kids and instead focus on being an aunt to her brother\u2019s child. And given that you make sure to throw in the detail about med school, I would not be surprised if this was not the first time she was asked to do something like that.", "YTA. a complete YTA. what did you expect from her? an over the top congratulatory celebration? she\u2019s hurting and grieving. not only has she been trying for years, she\u2019s getting IVF treatments. do you know how much couples, especially women, have to sacrifice during these treatments? the medications, the injections, the appointments? everything is timed, it becomes consuming and she is suffering. instead of asking her how she is doing and supporting her with understanding, you criticize her because she didn\u2019t welcome the news like YOU wanted her too. read the damn room. you really jacked this up. don\u2019t be surprised if your relationship with your daughter never recovers. your insensitivity and lack of empathy shit all over it.", "YTA I was in your daughters shoes. I hated being around pregnant people and ended up being fine around babies. My dad was sad about it but he also knew he couldn\u2019t force me to be happy for my brother. I just felt grief and shame. Also how the f do you expect her to control her emotions when you clearly can\u2019t control your own anger?", "Yta,  she was fine, she said congratulation, she took sometime.   \n\nYou inserted yourself angrily into a situation that was in need of kindness and that was none of your business.    You owe a huge apology", "YTA YTA YTA\n\nI was in the same shoes as your daughter. My husband and I tried for kids for years. Tests, IVF, you name it. It takes its emotional toll on you and your partner. Nieces and nephews were born one after the other while my husband and I struggled. We took a step back from the family. We needed it.\n\nWe still went to family functions. We still fawned over our nieces and nephews. But when we needed space, we took it.

And it's your fault.", "YTA in the strongest possible terms. As an infertile person who has had four failed rounds of ivf, finding out close family members are pregnant is honestly one of the most crushing things me and my partner experience in our life now. All the trauma and hurt and grief resurfaces each and every time. You don\u2019t know, because you successfully had children. It is utterly soul destroying.\n\nPlease, please give your daughter the time and space she needs and respect her feelings in a devastating situation. She will be happy for her brother in her own way, but this is something she is going to find incredibly hard and that is not her fault. As her parent you should be supporting her in any way you can, not berating her.", "I am in this exact same position so I can explain to you. I am around Sarah\u2019s age and my husband and I have infertility issues for 3 years now. Around 3 years ago, my husband\u2019a brother (who is also around Adam\u2019s age) called us to let us know that he and his wife were expecting. We wished them well but I can tell you how broken I was inside. Infertility trauma has been shown by research to be as stressful as cancer or HIV. Often it\u2019s hard to see from the outside. You feel fragile and confused. You want to be happy for close people around you that get pregnant easily but it feels like a competition for no reason. It feels unfair that you came make sense of your journey or why you are being punished thus. With no end in sight, uncertainty looming large, not knowing when you will be triggered, exhausted from the meds, stressed abt every appointment and the bad news that follows - it\u2019s one of horrible roller coaster ride. \n\nAround the time my husband\u2019s sister in law delivered - I went into depression. Husbands parents were glowing at the prospect of the new grandchild. It made me sick to my stomach. I try to do the right thing in every situation but here I was at clash with my own value system. The resentment was strong. I couldn\u2019t even properly connect with the child till she was 1. Now that she is 1.5, we took a 2 week trip to spend time with her and we love her. I have made efforts for the sake of my husband to establish harmony and love. But if his parents had force joy on us, I would have cut my ties with everyone. I 100% understand Sarah\u2019s position. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s always best to give pregnancy announcements by text. Esp if you know they are going through infertility. Do not put them in a spot and force them to face their conflicting emotions with you on the phone. Everyone (except Sarah and Joey) are the assholes here. Just let the woman be and let her grieve for as long as she needs.

You seem to want to force her to not feel a certain way? Which is controlling and bizarre.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be frustrated with the situation, but your anger was the opposite of what you should have done\n\nIf you want an option for a better response, you could have said something like: \u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to overstep or meddle into your personal business, but I wanted to extend some love and support. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably feeling a certain way about your brothers news. Of course you don\u2019t have to tell us about any of that if you don\u2019t want to.

Those feelings should come from a place of compassion and understanding. If you feel frustration and anger, perhaps try to look at the situation differently or wait until you feel calmer to communicate", "YTA and big time! Yikes, no wonder your daughter doesn\u2019t want to talk to you! Your son and his wife\u2019s feelings aren\u2019t more important than your daughter\u2019s feelings. While yes, your son was disappointed that his sister wasn\u2019t \u201chappy enough,\u201d for him, she did send along some congratulations. Texting those congratulations was probably easier for her over text because of how sad she must\u2019ve been feeling, but that\u2019s good that she still sent them. \n\nAnd now, because your daughter isn\u2019t on your timeline you do an angry voicemail?! Why in the world would you think that was a good idea!? Your daughter is a person with her own feelings and her own timeline for processing information, don\u2019t rush it. \n\nBy the way: having feelings isn\u2019t \u201crude behavior,\u201d it\u2019s called being a human being!", "YTA - A million percent.

You have no idea what she's going through because you got to have something she may never have. You're not supportive at all because you berated her for being upset. It's hard for her because her brother gets to have everything she wants. What do you want her to do, throw a freaking party? You're being extremely selfish and nasty and you should be ashamed of yourself. You have no idea how hard it is to know that what so many other people get to have will never be an option for you because you didn't have to go through that. But I did. And now your daughter is too. At least now she knows how awful you are so she'll know better than to turn to you for support since you're too selfish to give it.", "YTA congrats on making her feel worse. she can't force herself to be genuinely happy but she was civil with her brother. then you come along and rather than talk to her like an adult and see if she's okay, you went to instant asshole. so yes YTA for your crappy attitude", "YTA.

You're right she's handling badly and should be happy for her sibling.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID....she tried to disengage and you forced her hand. Why couldn't you give her the time she needs to process? She's probably thinking of years of watching her sibling's child grow up while her own womb remains empty. It's very heart breaking and you're all so self centered about this.\n\nCan't you just be happy for your grandchild that is on its way instead of rubbing your daughter's nose in her pain?

Did you really think being angry at her was going to help? Did it occur to you that she needs time to deal with this?

Sarah got married five years ago, Adam got married four years ago.  Sarah and her husband Joey (38M) have been trying for kids since they got married but got delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, and they are now going through IVF.  Adam and his wife Clarissa (32F) put off having kids for a couple of years while Adam was in med school, but then started trying for kids.  It's been really hard for Sarah and Joey to have kids, and there've been several complications, but things are now back on track.  However, due to the length of time it's taking, Sarah is becoming more and more depressed.  We're trying to support her, but there's only so much we can do.  The doctors haven't told her she can't have kids, but it's getting less and less likely as she grows older.\n\nAdam and Clarissa recently found out that they're expecting a child, much to their (and our) excitement.  However, they're hesitating about how to tell Sarah.  Adam really looks up to his older sister - they're very close, as my wife and I worked a lot when they were younger and my kids only had each other for a while.  Adam didn't want to cause his sister more emotional distress, but he wanted to tell her before Clarissa became very pregnant.  Adam decided to just call Sarah and tell her directly, and from what he told us later, she did not take it well... at all.  She wished him a perfunctory 'congratulations', and has been incommunicado since then.  We tried to respect her privacy while she processed this, but eventually I had had enough.  Adam's upset that his sister isn't happy for him, Clarissa is hurt that her sister-in-law isn't supportive, and my wife misses her daughter.  \n\nEventually I called Sarah, got her voicemail, and left her a very angry message telling her that even if she can't have kids, she should be happy for her brother and that she can at least be an aunt.  Sarah sent me one angry text message with a lot of expletives and told me not to contact her again.  When I showed this to my wife, she got upset at me and said that I should've worded the text nicer, but I said that infertility isn't an excuse for rude behavior.\n\nSo, AITA for this text and my attitude towards my daughter?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

By lashing out at her you have caused her more pain. I would apologise to her and then give her time.

You may not appreciate how Sarah is handling her SIL's pregnancy, but you have no right to be ***angry*** about it! \n\nThink it through, given her state of mind, did you really think that leaving such a message would help the situation?  Or was it just more important for you to blow up at her, regardless of the consequences, because you were annoyed at her behavior?  \n\nYou have no idea what your daughter is going through, OP, and you were judgmental and mean.  The hormones your daughter is taking can affect her personality,and cause depression, the whole process can be exhausting, and physically painful, you have no idea.  \n\nYou aren't right in this situation.  Anger is also an inappropriate response to infertility, Dad.  I would beg your daughter for forgiveness in person if I were you.  If she won't see you, maybe your wife should call your daughter's husband if she isn't responding to her directly and offer support to them both.", "YTA!  You seem to be expecting her to do cartwheels and that is just unrealistic. You have no idea the emotional trauma going through ivf can create.   The sight of a child can create a deeper depression in women and you want her to be excited?", "absolutely YTA. this was not for you to step in on. you should have left your daughter alone to process, no matter how long it took. you majorly overstepped and sounds like it cost you your relationship. you need to apologize and accept when she continues to not want contact.", "Sometimes it just takes an outsider's point of view.", "I hadn't thought about it from this perspective. \n\nThank you internet stranger", "Exactly. It took me 10 years and 3 rounds of IVF to have my son. In the meantime, friends and family were reproducing all over the shop!

She was never rude, she never projected her feelings on anyone, she just needed space. It\u2019s not easy hearing others are pregnant while you\u2019ve been so desperately longing for it. It\u2019s ridiculous to expect her to be a saint and solely be happy and not understand her other feelings. If you were going to address it you should\u2019ve done it at least somewhat nicely?

Its also about how you identify as a person and where you see yourself within your little world. Your daughter is grieving for everything she hoped she would have. The fact she is close to her brother adds to this grief as she would have had some vague thoughts or well thought out daydreams about raising her child with their cousin. \n\nThis is so totally rubbish for her. \n\nI\u2019ve been there. Its like a physical hurt. She will get closure when the process (whether they stop at ivf or go on to other routes is included in this) is over, no matter what the outcome, but this experience may have changed her for good. \n\nAlso be aware that IVF puts a huge strain on relationships.

No. But that's something she needs to work through on her own time and with a therapist. It's not something that she can just \"get over\" at the drop of a hat because you say so.", "Yes.  YTA.  Trying to force someone to feel a certain way when they don't because it's \"right\" is an AH move.  Sarah is jealous and resentful and that's how she feels and it's not up to YOU to tell her to get over it.  Not sure why her SiL needs her support when she likely had a lot of other people around.", "YTA. You're gonna get raked over the coals for this one bucko. Get the popcorn.", "YTA - dude cmon.. that\u2019s so messed up to say to someone. She can be happy and sad at the same time.

See this same shit with my in laws.

I never understand what goes through peoples minds like yours", "YTA", "YTA for making me read this lame ass ragebait. Did you even try? On the very slim near nonexistent chance this is real, I hope your daughter never speaks to you again and leaves y'all to rot. Why is everyone upset at her for not being supportive? Are you all this emotionally constipated and ignorant? I feel horrible for your daughter if she's real.", "YTA- Jesus Christ", "YTA. She wished him congratulations and she was trying to process it. Instead of giving her the space to deal with her emotions, considering how long and hard they have tried to have a kid, you texted her angry words. Also, she is 38. She has a good chance of having kids, though she seems to be struggling.", "YTA. Genuinely absurd that you wouldn't see that.", "Major YTA. You know that two things can be true at the same time, right? She can be happy for her brother and sad for herself. There's nothing wrong with that. You're totally wrong for getting angry at her for feeling her feelings. You really  should have minded your business and not left that voicemail.\n\nAnd how heartless to tell her \"at least you'll get to be an aunt\". Like she should be happy with a consolation prize if she doesn't get to have a baby of her own.", "It took me 6yrs, multiple losses and multiple rounds of IVF to get pregnant. She just needed time. That\u2019s all. Yta", "Wow. YTA. A HUGE AH. As a dude, even I can't fathom that you wouldn't understand this.\n\nIs your daughter fat? Call her that too just to twist the knife a little.

Just check in on her and say that you were all concerned. She may have opened up about her feelings after some time. Attacking her and demanding she act a certain way wasn\u2019t the right call. She wasn\u2019t rude. She said congrats then wanted space to process things. You all should have just given her some time.", "YTA. She was polite to her brother and wished him congratulations. She's now taking the time to process her feelings. She hasn't done anything wrong or objectionable to sane people. If you're daughter had instead been openly upset and working through her feelings, you'd probably call her an AH too, for \"ruining\" everyone's joy with her inconvenient grief/anger/whatever.

Do literally 5 minutes of research on infertility and you\u2019d have known how to handle it but for the future - a) text the news or email; and b) don\u2019t be the person that says \u201cAT LEAST YOU\u2019RE AN AUNT\u201d like that means anything to people in the throes of infertility.", "YTA She told him congrats, right?

You have to be considerate to her feelings and how difficult it is as a woman who\u2019s trying to but cant get pregnant. \n\ni could see if she said \u201chow dare you have kids when you know i can\u2019t\u201d but she congratulated them. How can u not see she\u2019s hurt? i would go no contact too i don\u2019t blame her.", "YTA. Your daughter gave a normal response and needs some time. Supporting her is not leaving angry and insensitive voice messages.", "you\u2019re a giant asshole who doesn\u2019t deserve to have grandchildren. if you can\u2019t even love your own kids correctly, why on earth do you think you deserve grandchildren in your life?", "YTA for leaving an angry voicemail. Why did you do that? She said congratulations, she then stepped back so everyone could be happy while she took care of her emotions. You could have been there for her but you picked the low road.", "YTA: I think all of you could have been more understanding of how this news was hard\nfor Sarah to hear and respected her need for space to process her feelings, but you especially are TA. You essentially threw her potential inability to have kids in her face.", "YTA. Your daughter is hurting!! She did fine with the news.  She needs her space. She deserves to be comforted, respected and loved by a caring family. She deserves it as much as her brother deserves a hearty congratulations and support for the wonderful life changes that are coming.  You feel way short.", "YTA 1000%!\n\nYour daughter didn't act out. She didn't turn this into something about herself. She congratulated them and took the time to process that she needs. Infertility is painful, lonely, and full of emotion. It doesn't matter if you're surrounded by a million people going through a similar thing or not. It is lonely. It is hard. It makes both your daughter and son in law feel as if they've failed in ways they can't describe. The hormones and side effects of fertility treatments are excruciating. Their world is in upset and all you did was make them feel worse. They know that other people can still have babies and can be congratulatory about it, but deep inside they are grieving with each announcement. \n\nNobody talks about how hard infertility is when you're younger. You grow up just thinking \"oh yeah, I'll get married and have some kids and it'll be great!\" Then you start trying to have kids and it doesn't happen. It's a gut punch. You feel it's something everybody should be able to do easily. But it's not easy for a lot of people. And if it didn't happen to you, it's easy for you not to get what it's like. The lack of empathy is disgusting.", "YTA. Your poor daughter is trying to process a lot. Her life isn't perhaps panning out as she had anticipated, and there is a nervousness about the future and potential grief at what might not be. I am sure she will be pleased for her brother, but that might take time. She may be feeling jealous, and probably a bit of \"when will it be my turn\". \n\nI can remember trying so hard to be happy for friends who broke the news of their pregnancies to be happy for them, but I felt so incredibly sad for me at the same time. That is a lot of emotional load to try and work with. \n\nThen you waltz in and try and offer up second prize of being an aunt, being incredibly insensitive. If she doesn't go no contact with you for a while, she's a bigger person than me.\n\nInfertility isn't an excuse for YOUR poor behaviour. Do better by your daughter.", "If infertility isn\u2019t an excuse for rude behavior, what\u2019s your excuse for rude behavior? YTA", "oh..big YTA. the daughter didn't do anything to anybody, she congratulated her brother and then distanced herself most likely out of grief to make sure she didn't lash out..and you react like this? abhorrent", "Her reaction was fine and normal for someone who\u2019s going through what she\u2019s going through. She was taking the time she needed, and you stepped in and behaves like a complete boor. You owe her a huge apology. YTA", "YTA. We get it. You don\u2019t care about your daughter. You want her as a prop to perform functions such as \u201chappy offspring\u201d and \u201cexcited sister\u201d. \n\nSorry that it\u2019s so annoying she went through a traumatic experience.", "YTA seems insufficient. There needs to be a level beyond asshole for people like you. Giga asshole or something. \n\nApologize profusely and then back off for a long, long time.", "YTA\n\nShe needs time, she wasn't rude, but what you did might make he want to reconsider talking to anyone in the family. Talk about entitled.", "YTA \n\nYou got angry and decided to rip someone a new asshole instead of just sitting down and having a calm discussion with her about the situation. \n\nYou say that infertility isn\u2019t an excuse for rude, but yet you decided the perceived rudeness of one child to another justified you being rude. Can you comprehend the hypocrisy? Is it possible your knee jerk reaction is to always accuse and yell? I don\u2019t blame her for going no contact.", "YTA.  That was waaay out line.  She doesn't have to be excited for someone else when she is struggling.  She didn't flip out on him, she said congratulations and took some time to process.  You sound super callous right now.", "YTA \u201cinfertility isn\u2019t an excuse for rude behavior\u201d Good on her for giving you expletives. Give your daughter space, in that I mean don\u2019t speak to her again unless she initiates a conversation on her own terms.", "\"...that she can at least be an aunt\". Are you actually for real? On what planet do you think that's some consolation?? I take that back, clearly you put no though towards how your daughter is feeling at all. This is from a very proud auntie that FINALLY got my own baby this year, YTA, YTA, YTA.", "YTA why did you put yourself in the middle of that situation? Let them work it out themselves. Did you really think she was going to celebrate?? If I was you I would apologize. And I wouldn't send it in an email. You really overstepped.", "YTA Sorry, it's not that she's not happy for her brother, she's just so sad for herself. My younger sister told me about her pregnancy the week my first iui failed, I cried for 24 hours, I'm not exaggerating. I was watching everyone around me have babies and I didn't know if I would ever be a mother. The grief is like nothing else I've experienced. \n\nWhat your daughter needs is understanding from her parents, acknowledgement of her pain, and resources. Support groups, money, a listening ear, and a hug.", "YTA. She wasn\u2019t been cruel to Adam or anyone for that matter. Infertility is an extremely difficult thing and she was processing in her own way. \n\nI have a close friend whose struggles similarly and I\u2019ve been super sensitive about baby related topics with her since I got pregnant, I let her come to me about it. If she\u2019s unable to be a support to me through my pregnancy the way she otherwise would, I totally understand and do not hold it against her. I know she\u2019s happy for me but I also understand it\u2019s a sore subject. \n\nYour daughter is feeling you\u2019re supporting your son\u2019s needs over hers and the fact that she\u2019s already depressed just adds insult to injury. \n\nAlso, leaving an angry message is totally inappropriate and unproductive. What did you think you were going to solve with that?

I personally wouldn't just from what you wrote here.", "Ehhh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry but I have little empathy for women who can\u2019t get pregnant and take it out on the others around them who can and expect everyone to be apart of their pity party. (I am a mom who suffered many many miscarriages in my journey to have kids). Not just that, everyone tells them it\u2019s ok and justified. I had plenty of friends get pregnant and have healthy babies between my miscarriages but that didn\u2019t discourage my joy for them. Do we have a right to be sad, sure, do we have a right to lash out on others or throw emotional tantrums (silent treatments)? Nope. \n\nAs a parent calling and yelling at her was a dick move, you should have called to talk, be a shoulder to cry on, and also be a source of wisdom. (YTA)", "YTA.

What in the world led you to believe that an angry voicemail is the way to communicate with a depressed person?!", "Your daughter is going through a difficult and lonely journey. It is incredibly hard to deal with infertility, especially when everyone around you makes it seem so easy. She's struggling emotionally and you just absolutely broke her heart. It took my husband & I over 12 years to conceive, doctors had eventually told us it wasn't going to happen. My parents never stopped having faith in me and I couldn't imagine them ever being as cruel as you are. The yearning to be a mother is an indescribable pain. YTA for adding to her heartbreak!!!  She would have came around in her own time. Now she may never....", "YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. I think everyone else\u2019s comments pretty much summarize everything.", "Wow. WOW. Yeah, YTA and so is your wife - \u201cshould have worded it nicer\u201d?! WTF. NO. Your daughter has had problems conceiving and is now doing IVF; even IF she is doing hormone-free IVF, her emotions are bouncing all over the place. Instead of giving her time and space to process and deal with her emotions, you tried to force her to do it *your way.* Guess what? Neither you nor your wife get to dictate how other people process their trauma.

Your message makes it sound like all that matters is pleasing everyone else. I never told anyone, but I cried (alone) when my brother and his wife announced their pregnancy.

NTAH.", "YTA for your harsh wording, but you do have a point. Ghosting your sibling (and family) with whom you're actually close with when your sibling has the great news of pregnancy... That can be seen as selfish and kind of a dick move, but understandable in the context of her grief. She distanced herself from the situation instead of creating any drama and sometimes that's all you can ask of people. But yeah let's not pretend she wasn't selfish there also. Usually close people are there to share the joy with their loved ones and she didn't even damn try. The rest of you had right to feel upset about her reaction, but yeah, the way you handled it was just bad.\n\nThis is one of those cases where the whole reddit seems to take one aggressive side, but OP you weren't THAT bad or THAT wrong.

You just ruined your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA\n\nAs someone who went through similar fertility struggles to your daughter, I would say her behaviour is totally normal. To manage a congratulations and then removing herself from the situation may have been all she could manage at that time. It certainly was the only thing I could manage when friends announced their pregnancies. One time we were out, a friend announced a pregnancy in a group, I congratulated her and then went out and sat in my car and just sobbed. \n\nThe kindest thing a friend did for me was to announce her pregnancy via text message to me, saying something like 'I wanted to tell you this way so that you could process it in your own time and cry if you needed to without having to pretend to be happy for me'.

She knew that while you can be happy for someone else it is SUCH a devastating topic that you can so easily go over the edge into tears and grief for your own situation.\n\nHow could her own family not know that???

Like your daughter, my name is Sarah. Like your daughter, I tried for years to conceive including going through fertility treatments. I dreamed of being a mom my whole life. To say I wanted a child more than anything would be an understatement. I started trying at 28 and gave up at 39 after exhausting all of my options. I am now 46 and am just now getting to a place where I am not devastated by the loss of this dream. \n\nGiven that you and your wife were able to have Sarah and Adam, you have no ability to understand what she is going through. Not being able to have a child when you want one so badly is the greatest grief I think a person can experience, short of actually losing a child.\n\nSarah handled this as well as anyone could be expected to. She congratulated Adam, excused herself from the call, and retreated to process her own feelings. Those feelings may include her own grief combined with happiness for her brother and his wife, and a plethora of other feelings that take time to process and work through. Instead of giving her the time and space she needed to navigate these complex emotions, you called her and left her an angry voicemail, in which you weaponized her fertility issues, in an attempt to guilt her into responding in a manner you feel is appropriate.

You got to experience the joy of having two babies, watching them grow and raising them, and feeling the joy of being a parent. You have no clue what it is like for her to keep trying whilst growing ever more terrified that she will never get to have that joy. Ask you wife how she felt when you kids moved and kicked in the womb. Remember when you first saw them. Remember all those firsts you got to experience. She is now realising that not only may she never get to have that, but that her brother is, and she is wondering why their issues were resolved whilst she is still childless. She's wondering if it's her fault, and she's trying to figure out how she's going to cope with seeing her sister-in-law pregnant and watching her brother with a newborn when she's so desperate for those things.\n\nShe said congratulations, but that wasn't good enough for you and your son and DIL. Nope, she's not allowed to take time to process her feelings and figure things out. She needs to be the right amount of happy for you all, and the fact that she isn't throwing a parade for her brother means that she isn't happy for him, according to you three.

Consider that the excitement and happiness the rest of you are feeling at your son and DIL's pregnancy is not in the slightest bit comparable in scale to your \"yeah it kinda sucks\" regarding your daughter's infertility. Your \"yeah it kinda sucks\" doesn't interfere or conflict at all with the happiness. If your son and daughter are really as close as you say they are, then your daughter is dealing with both of those sets of feelings on the same scale as just your excitement. *Of course* she needs time to process that, learn how to separate them and be able to be present in her brother's life without being weighed down by the heartache in hers.

Your kids are adults and as they grow older, their relationship is going to change. It may be disappointing to you if in the future they aren't as close as they used to be, but that's for them to decide. Your son handled the situation fine, as the news should have come from him, and should have happened before it became a cornerstone of every conversation (as it is wont to do with the pregnancy of the first child and grandchild). Your daughter would have likely come around in her own time. All that was required of you was to be there for your son and his family, and be there for your daughter and hers in the way that they each needed.", "YTA \n\nYou totally invalidated her feelings. You, your wife, your son should be more empathetic towards Sarah. She did congratulate her brother but that wasn\u2019t enough for YOU.

It took me three years to get pregnant and while I was never able to get pregnant again, I count myself lucky. There\u2019s a whole host of emotions that go with infertility and it\u2019s not something you can brush off. \n\nIn case it\u2019s not clear enough for you\u2026YTA big time.

Man, you know most people don't fall all over themselves because someone gets pregnant.", "I can't think of a worse way to handle this. That was so unnecessarily cruel. You sound like you have some real anger issues and don't know how to manage your emotions. Seek help. YTA.", "Wowza YTA and a big one. If you had let her grieve in peace (and yes, it\u2019s grief) she would have eventually warmed up. Now your relationship with her if forever ruined. I hope you are happy.", "YTA. Is this a joke? You yelled at her? She didn\u2019t stoop that low in her pain when she got the news. If she has to be happy for her brother, required by you, then by hod, her brother had better be grieving for you. And you too. And you too.", "YTA!!! She said congratulations! She is happy for her brother but very upset for herself at the same time. you should have stayed out of it. Good Luck getting your daughter back. She doesn't owe you or anyone else an emotion that isn't real. Let her be", "You\u2019re a massive asshole. She congratulated them and was happy for them. She can be happy for them and still be sad for herself. She can be jealous and angry while still being happy for them. There are a lot of complex emotions that come a long with infertility. She obviously needs some time away so she can process everything. That\u2019s okay. What\u2019s absolutely not okay was your selfish reaction. If I was struggling to conceive and got a message like that from my father, that would be enough to end the relationship. So again, to reiterate, you\u2019re an asshole.", "YTA \n\nSigh. People are allowed to distance themselves to heal. Not having kids feels like the death of a dream. I lost the ability to have kids (kind of, it will be hard and expensive) to fibroids. \n\nI don't rain on anyone's parade, I congratulate. But I won't be a regular part of the showers or all the baby talk. I'm not there yet, and that's ok.

Telling someone \"you shouldn't be upset\" isn't exactly helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"she can at least be an aunt\"\n\nDid she ever say she *wouldn't* be an aunt?  I don't understand where this even came from.  The child isn't even close to being born yet and you're accusing her of not being an aunt to this unborn child already???", "YTA. You jumped to a conclusion that your daughter was infertile when that might not be true at all. It could be her partner that is infertile. Or maybe neither of them are infertile and it is just taking time because of their age. You shouldn't have gotten involved. This was none of your business.", "YTA. You don't get to decide what timeline other people process their emotions on. Your daughter is grieving and isolated herself in order not to hurt you all during her grief. Then, you took it upon yourself to get angry that she didn't have the response YOU wanted her to have so that YOU would get the feelings YOU wanted. You may have just ended your relationship with your daughter permanently with that little stunt.", "Wait, infertility is no excuse to be rude, but butting into your kids drama is? Yes, YTA.

I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re injecting yourself into this situation at all. Sarah is a grown adult with her own agency. It\u2019s not your place AT ALL to tell Sarah how to feel or how to act.", "YTA. Your daughter said congratulations and then was taking the time she needed to process her difficult emotions. You, as the parent, need to support both your children. It is possible to hold excitement and not for your son while also holding space for empathy and understanding for your daughter, and not trying to force her to feel emotions she is not yet ready to feel.

Don't you think you owe your daughter Sarah an apology?\n\nYup YTA.", "YTA: She congratulated him and then basically excused herself to get control of her feelings. She did exactly the right thing. You did not need to insert yourself into the middle of things and stir things up. \n\nShe probably is happy for them. It just takes a while to get past feeling even more sad for herself. She\u2019s absolutely right not to be processing all of that right in their faces. It\u2019s hard for everyone. \n\nI\u2019ve never been so relieved in all my life as the first time someone I loved told me they were pregnant and I was happier for them than I was sad for myself. Hopefully with time and patience your daughter will get to a place where she feels that way too, but it has to come from inside her. Until then, the best she can do is not burden others with how she\u2019s feeling and that\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to do.\n\nETA: Being an aunt is a special role and wonderful in its own right, but it is NOT a substitute for having your own child, nor is it a consolation prize.", "YTA. She congratulated him, and then needed space to process. Maybe she didn't talk to anyone after because she didn't want to say anything rude while she worked through her feelings. You should have told her you're there for her when she's ready to talk, and then left her alone to work through her feelings.", "YTA. \n\nYou have no idea what it is like to ride the emotional roller coaster every damn month, hoping and praying that THIS month will be the month only to be devastated and wrung out when it doesn't happen, again. Or what it's like when everyone around you gets pregnant, sometimes without even trying, and you can't. \n\nMy husband and I struggled with infertility for 15 years before we finally gave up, and by that point, I was deep into depression and self-loathing. When I started having suicide fantasies, I realized I needed professional help. \n\nI have been in your daughter's shoes when a close family member gets pregnant and you're hit with the conflicting emotions of being happy for them, but hating yourself even more because you can't. \n\nYou need to tell your daughter that no matter what, you love and support her. That it's okay for her to feel heartsick, it's okay to take time to process. Don't pressure her to go to a baby shower, don't hand her a newborn and tell her how great she looks holding a baby, and don't judge her when she avoids \"baby things.\" She probably needs to avoid baby things to keep herself together. \n\nI'll tell you what my therapist told me: the grief you feel from infertility is very similar to the grief of losing a loved one. Your heart doesn't know the difference. She is grieving the loss of \"family\" and dealing with the fear that her dream of being a mother may never happen, and she is likely blaming herself and feeling like a failure. You're kicking her while she's down. \n\nDo better.", "You are TA here. Congratulations to Adam and Clarissa. \n\nWhile I appreciate that Adam was trying to be respectful of Sarah\u2019s feelings \u2014 and good for him \u2014and it sounds like he tried to do it in a loving way, her initial response doesn\u2019t mean that she isn\u2019t happy for Adam and Clarissa. She might have simply been in a great deal of pain over her own issues. For you, your wife, Adam, or Clarissa to expect Sarah to get over it in your timeframe. No matter what you think or feel that is what you\u2019re doing. By expecting Sarah to work out her own, possibly very traumatic, experiences around trying to get pregnant and carry a child to term in whatever period of time you all feel is reasonable you\u2019re telling Sarah that she isn\u2019t entitled to grieve her own losses because it\u2019s interfering with Adam and Clarissa\u2019s happiness. And no matter what your intent, dollars to donuts days that is what Sarah is hearing. \n\nShould Sarah let this tear her life apart? Of course not! Eventually Sarah May need to speak to a therapist about this to get help processing it and moving on with her life. But, again, no matter how much you love Sarah you don\u2019t get to determine when that is.

It's really beyond disgusting and gross that his situation is perceived as everyone being \"wronged\" by a lack of positive attention.\n\nYou didn't think for second as father that perhaps you should have reached out in support of your daughter. You're \"enough is enough\" attitude is so entitled and backwards, like enough what? Enough not being super positive and supportive of this situation, enough bringing us down with your very real issues??\n\nThe text you sent wouldn't be out of place on an abusive forum.

I wanted to too, so so so so badly. I didn't want to be a downer to the joy but not becoming pregnant hurt SO much. Hormonally she is a mess due to IVF and their joint entire future (a family with her husband) is on the line. That also includes never becoming a grandparent.

Stopped speaking to me for months on end, each time we got pregnant. \n\nLater a sibling got pregnant and somehow everyone was excited for them. Polar opposite reactions.\n\nOf course I was excited for them, and I love our nieces and nephews. But that wound gets reopened every time I see how differently we were treated.

If she\u2019s on hormones to try and conceive, she\u2019s already a mess thanks to those. Now she sees her brother and SIL getting something she desperately wants. She can be sad for herself and love them at the same time. You picked favorites when you did that and best fix that or she\u2019ll remember it forever, I guarantee it.\n\nETA: support your kids where they are when they\u2019re there.

Heck, when one of my coworkers I was casually friends with became pregnant with twins, she made sure to take me aside and tell me privately because she knew I was having trouble.

They should be judged for their behavior. My SIL refused to look at me for six months and barely spoke to me when I was pregnant. And it got worse from there. She still doesn\u2019t think she did anything wrong because she \u201cwas in pain\u201d. You don\u2019t get to be toxic to other people because you\u2019re in pain.\n\nOf course, she was totally fine with her brother becoming a father. Only I, the woman, was the problem. And misogyny shouldn\u2019t be tolerated either and 100% people should be judged for it.", "And you never really fit in.  Ever.", "Exactly.", "Well, the comment they were replying to *literally* said it was unfair. We're really just seeing \"half empty\" vs. \"half full\" responses to infertility.", "Exactly. This is man who has two healthy children telling his daughter how she should feel about possibly never having a child. Let her be sad about her own situation and don't fucking yell at her because her response wasn't \"ideal\" from your own perspective. Grow some empathy.", "Comment should be stickied.", "This is just the best comment. Having gone through this shitty journey of infertility too, I couldn\u2019t of worded it better.", "She said congratulations. That is all that is required. Expecting that unhappy family members fake emotions so that other family members can feel good is an unreasonable demand.", "She may have been close to coming to terms with it and the voice mail set her back. OP may never know \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Hugs.", "I am so sorry. I hope things get easier and the sadness gets more gentle.", "And when I was struggling with infertility and grieving a miscarriage I was happy for others while also protecting my own heart and skipping events that were hard\u2026 there\u2019s no one right way.", "When I was struggling through infertility, I could not do baby showers, it was too painful. \nPeople do what they can.", "\\*offers internet hug\\*", "So sorry for your loss :(", "No problem! I was just trying to shed light on the angle I thought they were going for. It can definitely be hard to have trouble deciphering things on Reddit in particular. Easy to do!\ud83d\ude0a", "Ah! I see. Yes, agreed. I misunderstood your comment initially, my apologies. Thanks for the follow up clarification, it is appreciated and I agree with you! I hope you have a good day. :)", "I misunderstood what you were getting at as well & I shouldn\u2019t have as I\u2019m usually the one to point out such differences.  But for whatever reason, I hadn\u2019t thought of this from that angle.  But you\u2019re exactly right!", "EXACTLY what I was thinking.", "Nothing says stellar parent like \"my wife and I worked a lot so they only had each other for awhile\". I knew it was only going to get worse from there.", "I'm trying to look at this like \"Oh he didn't know how to handle this situation and just managed it poorly,\" but that would apply if he left a loving voicemail message, where he expressed concern for both his children. That would be ill-advised (just let her feel her feelings here) but understandable. Yelling at your child because she's maturely addressing her feelings at not being able to conceive yet and not taking it out on her brother who conceived easily? I don't think I can even give him a \"you tried\" sticker here - he didn't.", "Right! It\u2019s 100% effective", "It's stereotypical emotionally immature boomer parenting.\n\nI wonder all the time what  \"greatest generation\" parenting looked like given how emotionally stunted the boomers are.", "My parents did this all the time", "Never. How could you miss the sarcasm?", "Sending love your way, internet stranger. You\u2019re so strong, supporting your friends and family while shouldering that pain. I hope you thrive despite the pain", "We had a very similar story. Tried for a couple of years. Went into fertility treatments. Nothing worked. Meanwhile my younger sisters were having babies, my friends were having babies. Babies were being hurt by their parents in our family. It was horrible. \n\nI\u2019m now thirty years out from when we realized it probably was t going to happen. I will admit I still hear horror stories on the news about hurt kids and feel a loss because some people don\u2019t deserve children. But the pain is less often. We have had a great life without children. We travel around the US. We enjoy our quiet life. It gets easier. (Until your friends start having grandkids!)", "That\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t remove yourself from their lives. Wife and I are going through the same thing, likely can\u2019t have kids. It\u2019s hard, but the thought of pretty much removing ourselves from peoples lives because they\u2019re getting what we aren\u2019t is crazy to me.", "Avoiding someone isn\u2019t toxic behavior. \n\nGrieving parents avoiding children\u2019s parties, for example, are not being toxic. They\u2019re retreating. \n\nGrieving people can be depressed, withdrawn, bitter, morose, in a fog, easy to anger, in denial\u2026 It hits people in different ways. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your SIL said anything unkind to you. Just avoided you a bit during your pregnancy. \n\nSome women have breakdowns of serious mental health crisis, grappling with acceptance. Some commit suicide. Some become alcoholics. All she did was be quiet, not talk much, and not come around much, and you\u2019re acting like it was a vile attack. That\u2019s so sad. \n\nOP\u2019s daughter said nothing vile. She sounded tight when she offered congratulations, and then she retreated into her cave. Only his daughter knows what emotions she experienced in that moment. \n\nShe was condemned. \n\nThat\u2019s a great way to lose that relationship.", "So if you think she did something wrong, just what did she do wrong? \n\nNot looking at you enough? Not speaking enough to you enough?", "Judge not lest ye be judged\u2026.", "I'm currently experiencing infertility and now taking a break from TTC after my 3rd miscarriage sent me into a downward spiral of anxiety and health anxiety. \n\nA lot of people I know are announcing their pregnancies and I'll congratulate them and then keep my distance for a short while. My heart aches for OPs daughter, I hope she has a good support network.", "Exactly.", "Yes, no one right way, which is what a bunch of people here don't seem to get.", "Yes! Over my 7+ years of IVF struggles I threw baby showers and celebrated with people and I also withdrew and avoided. It was about where I was in a given time and how that other person was. A friend who posted on every IG post I made, \"oh, are you pregnant?!\" Cut. The ones who acted normal and didn't try to be cute detectives, they were good. Toxic positivity, nope. It's all about figuring out what you can and can't handle. \n\nAlso, with a dad like that, no wonder she's distant and protecting her heart.", "I've never struggled with infertility, but I lost my first baby at 40 weeks. Baby showers are still (12 years later) very difficult for me, especially showers for baby girls as my baby was my first daughter. I still duck out early sometimes because it's very painful. Grief never goes away, and like you said, people do what they can, 5 days or 5 decades even after the fact.", "I skipped having a baby shower with my son after 15 years of infertility because even my own baby shower would have been painful. Until someone has been in the exact same situation, you can\u2019t tell them how to handle their own grief.", "Thanks!  :)", "My brothers tell me happy mom's day every yr bc of this. Our parents routinely abandoned us (gone for days at a time)", "Keep D's want time, your attention - not things and no paremrs", "Boomers seriously cannot fucking handle when their kids have emotions that they don\u2019t want them to have. It\u2019s absolutely wild.", "It's generational trauma. It's a whole lineage of emotional immaturity and poor parenting. They behave in ways that were modeled by their parents or how they learned to survive their parents' behavior. It ends when someone makes a conscious decision to change.", "Mad Men does a great job portraying this - a lot of the parents are just like the stories my dad (boomer) tells about his family. Absolutely zero emotional intelligence, and the kids suffer for it.", "That\u2019s a very good point.  Greatest in some regards, not so much in others.", "I suggest you read the thread before posting \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like your SIL said anything unkind to you\u201d.", "I had no issue with her avoiding me and expected it. What happened was that if  we were sitting across from each other she would obviously look over my head or to the side. If we came across another in a hallway she would look anywhere but at me. If I asked her anything, \u201cWould you like some potatoes\u201d she\u2019d respond as abruptly and rudely as possible, while making it obvious that she wasn\u2019t looking at me, if she didn\u2019t simply ignore me. She later did this to our SIL as well.\n\nMy bigger problem is how she acted after I gave birth (cursing me out while I was hooked to IVs) and her response when she learned our daughter was dying (posting a picture of her BFF\u2019s kid and refusing to reach out in support in any way). Daughter did end up pulling through, but we did not know that at the time, to the point of picking out a gravesite.\n\nShe was also ableist about my daughter\u2019s subsequent disabilities, and there was a clear element of misogyny in that her toxic behaviors were only directed at our other SIL and myself, but never at her brothers (the fathers). She does not believe this behavior was wrong and was astonished when it effected her relationships, as prior to my SIL and I putting our feet down her family had bent over backwards to accommodate her in everything because she was childless. \n\nMost of what you said doesn\u2019t apply to her. She has no fertility problems. Her husband is sterile and they believe it is morally wrong to use a sperm donor. Ironically, he has always been better about the situation than she.", "Not looking at me at all for over six months each time I was pregnant and doing the same to our other SIL. Cursing me out while I was hooked to IVs for \u201cstealing\u201d her chance to have the first male or female grandchild. Responding to being told our daughter was dying by posting a picture of her friend\u2019s baby and not reaching out when our daughter was dying. Being incredibly ableist toward my daughter and other disabled children. The inherent misogyny of only being upset at our other SIL and me, but never at her brothers. \n\nAmong many other things. \n\nShe has also never apologized for most of this, and she still doesn\u2019t really think anything she did was wrong.\n\nBy \u2018not looking\u2019 I mean that if I was in front of her she\u2019d look to the side. If she had to speak to me she looked away while doing so and was as short as possible. Have you ever intentionally not looked at someone because you were upset at them? That\u2019s what she did from the moment she found out I was expecting until after I gave birth. And she did it to our other SIL too.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "My boomer mom is like this with my kids (16 months and just-turned-5) and it drives me NUTS. Like sorry your response to tears is yelling, you psycho.", "I am sorry for the loss of your daughter.", "The other stuff could possibly be forgotten eventually but the attitude about your child possibly dying would take pretty much an act of God Himself for me to get past. That is absolutely indefensible. She should be on her face begging forgiveness for that \ud83d\ude21", "Thank you. Thankfully she did end up surviving, albeit severely disabled. It was a terrifying few weeks; we went from \u201cpick out a gravesite, she\u2019s going to die tonight\u201d to \u201cshe\u2019s a vegetable, consider taking her off life support\u201d to \u201cshe\u2019s going to live and we have no clue how functional she\u2019ll be.\u201d"]}
