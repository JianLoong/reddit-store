Sarah got married five years ago, Adam got married four years ago.  Sarah and her husband Joey (38M) have been trying for kids since they got married but got delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, and they are now going through IVF.  Adam and his wife Clarissa (32F) put off having kids for a couple of years while Adam was in med school, but then started trying for kids.  It's been really hard for Sarah and Joey to have kids, and there've been several complications, but things are now back on track.  However, due to the length of time it's taking, Sarah is becoming more and more depressed.  We're trying to support her, but there's only so much we can do.  The doctors haven't told her she can't have kids, but it's getting less and less likely as she grows older.\n\nAdam and Clarissa recently found out that they're expecting a child, much to their (and our) excitement.  However, they're hesitating about how to tell Sarah.  Adam really looks up to his older sister - they're very close, as my wife and I worked a lot when they were younger and my kids only had each other for a while.  Adam didn't want to cause his sister more emotional distress, but he wanted to tell her before Clarissa became very pregnant.  Adam decided to just call Sarah and tell her directly, and from what he told us later, she did not take it well... at all.  She wished him a perfunctory 'congratulations', and has been incommunicado since then.  We tried to respect her privacy while she processed this, but eventually I had had enough.  Adam's upset that his sister isn't happy for him, Clarissa is hurt that her sister-in-law isn't supportive, and my wife misses her daughter.  \n\nEventually I called Sarah, got her voicemail, and left her a very angry message telling her that even if she can't have kids, she should be happy for her brother and that she can at least be an aunt.  Sarah sent me one angry text message with a lot of expletives and told me not to contact her again.  When I showed this to my wife, she got upset at me and said that I should've worded the text nicer, but I said that infertility isn't an excuse for rude behavior.\n\nSo, AITA for this text and my attitude towards my daughter?", "created_utc": 1694109556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cm5vf/aita_for_a_text_message_i_sent_to_my_potentially/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can understand talking to her but you were very much so not empathetic and your execution was terrible. She is probably processing a lot, getting older, being infertile (potentially), and trying to be happy for her brother. I am sure deep down she is happy for him. She is probably mad at herself for not being as supportive as she wants to be.\n\nIt isn't something you will really ever understand, you have two kids.", "YTA\n\n>she did not take it well... at all. She wished him a perfunctory 'congratulations', and has been incommunicado since then. \n\nShe took it just fine. She wished them congratulations and went to process her feelings by herself without projecting them at her brother. You want something unreasonable from her - she's not obliged to get excited or not be sad..", "\u201cWe tried to respect her privacy while she processed this\u201d.   What does that mean.  You left her alone, didn\u2019t call?  Or you reached out here and there, asked if there was anything we could help with. \n\nBecause she can\u2019t get pregnant. Then brother gets pregnant and suddenly no one is calling her. She may have asked her brother for time, but did she ask it from you?  Did she ask for time from your wife?  \n\nIf the first time you reach out to her after knowing she got the news it to yell at her, YTA. \n\nNot being able to get pregnant can be a lot like a miscarriage. Coming to terms with not being a mom. Coming to terms with never feeling a baby move inside you. Coming to terms with the picture you have in your head will never be. And now she is coming to terms with her brother getting his happily ever after. That you and your wife will get your happily ever after with grandkids that aren\u2019t hers. That while she might be a part of that picture it will be more of a spectator role than active participant. \n\nThere is a lot of hurt involved. The feeling your body betrayed you. Questioning why not you when everyone else can finally get pregnant and you can\u2019t. If there have been fertility treatments, the money you wasted that you\u2019ll never get back.\nIt\u2019s a grieving process and it takes time. And the fact that you yelled at her that other people\u2019s feelings are more important than her mental health. Congratulations you just threw more guilt and shame and feeling of inadequacy into that pile. \n\nDid I mention YTA!", ">even if she can't have kids, she should be happy for her brother and that she can at least be an aunt.\n\n\nOoooh boy.  You really should have minded your own business.  Cause this statement is amazingly tone deaf.\n\nYTA.", "Gee I don\u2019t know why yelling at her didn\u2019t work /s YTA. There are kind ways to help and then there is what you did. You could have said \u201cWe understand this is hard for you but we miss you. Please stop by\u201d and then you could have a KIND conversation with her in person about asking if she thinks she can be around the baby and offer any support including attending therapy with her. You made it worse.", "Your daughter is having a difficult time trying to conceive. For YEARS..\n\nAnd at a time when it'll be more and more likely that she'll NEVER conceive, without even really trying her brother and SIL are expecting.\n\nShe's grieving, she's depressed, and for her own mental sanity she took herself away from it all to come to terms with this on her own.\n\n*<Adam's upset that his sister isn't happy for him, Clarissa is hurt that her sister-in-law isn't supportive, and my wife misses her daughter.>*\n\nAnd instead of respecting your daughter's space, you decided that HER feelings are NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL compared to the feelings of the happy expecting couple and future grandma.\n\nINFO: How are your daughter's feelings \"rude behavior\"?\n\nWasn't it rude of you to blatantly ignore her feelings and calling her out for not accepting she can't have kids (INFO ; Was the \"can't have kids\" already medically confirmed?) and not be chearing with the rest of the family?\n\nLooking forwards to your REDDIT post asking us how to FIX this.\n\nAnswer: No idea, that was a truly awful, inconsiderate and sh\\*tty thing you did....\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYour wife was right to get upset at you.\n\nWay to kick a person when they're down.", "YTA. You should have kept out of it. You're playing favorites.", "YTA.  When you called her, you should have shown compassion to your daughter by saying you know her brother told her that they were expecting, that you love her, and if she wants to talk, you are there for her.  Instead, you bulldozed in and yelled at her.  Why would you even do that?", "OP you know you are, why even ask, YTA.  \n\nInfertility is painful for women who are experiencing it.  It hurts to see others have babies and they still don't.  I just can't imagine why you would think yelling at your adult depressed daughter would do anything to help.  \n\nLook, I was your daughter in law, I had six babies total, I started younger, it was easy for me.  My sister-in-law worked on her career and married in her 40s, she wanted a child, she became pregnant, and I became pregnant at the same time, sadly she miscarried.  I have a child the same age Her's would have been.  She was polite to us at family gatherings for a while but never the same.  To make it worse, I became pregnant AGAIN a few years later.  I didn't want to tell her at all, I felt bad.  When she found out it was full no contact, not just for her but she got my mother-in-law and my other sister-in-law to also go no contact.  It crushed my husband at the time.  about ten years later, mother-in-law died, and the funeral was the first time they met my youngest son.  Obviously, mother-in-law never met him, they didn't even know he was a boy.   The damage was done already, and we still stayed very low contact with them to this day.  They showed up for a couple of my kid's graduations.  I think my children (now adults) go see them on occasion, but it's still just casually polite.  Nothing like the super close family we were.  My youngest kids don't remember their grandma on that side, my older kids barely remember her.\n\nYou may have damaged this beyond repair, but you need to send your daughter flowers and beg forgiveness, before you never see her again.", "YTA. I get what you were going for, and your instincts to try to talk to Sarah weren't horrible, but you went about it in an incredibly rude way.\n\nYou left her an angry voicemail message? Why? Did you think that would accomplish anything besides hurting her more?", "Oh my. YTA.\n\nYou don't get to decide when and how someone else processes their grief! Are you serious? That was so sadly insensitive as a parent. You owe her some massive apologies. I don't know if you can ever make this right, but you better start groveling now. You showed a complete lack of empathy for someone you claim you love.", "Yta  100%", "YTA you made things worse!!!", "YTA. Don\u2019t have meaningful conversations with your kids about sensitive topics over text.", "Big YTA.  Your daughter is obviously struggling hard with this and instead of being supportive you attack her for being depressed.", "Edit to add: YTA You are right infertility is not an excuse for bad behaviour so why did you send that text (edit: sorry voicemail) ? Do you send newly grieving widows texts/voicemail saying that they are being selfish in not rejoicing in marriages and should expect to share the husband?\n\nYour daughter is barren. She wants to have children and can't. She is grieving the ability to have a child, watch them grow up, go to school, graduate, move out, a whole host of milestones. She is likely feeling influenced by the societal pressure that is woman must have baby and feeling a failure. Her perception of self has been rocked. \n\nShe didn't scream at them. She didn't try to make it about herself. She congratulated them and then withdrew to process it all. I am sorry your brother and SIL wants their sister to be joyful but they have the rest of the family to share with. Why don't they have the grace to drop what they want from your daughter and give her what she needs? Peace to come to terms with her loss. \n\nAnd you wade into this rawness saying she needs to put it all behind her. I mean she might be allowed to play with her sister's baby. That's good enough isn't it?", "YTA. This news hit so close to home for your daughter, and put into her face what she might never be able to have. Instead of giving her time to get used to the news, you decided that you\u2019d rather berate her, piling more on her head in what\u2019s clearly a difficult time. Your response to your wife that \u201cinfertility is no excuse for rude behavior,\u201d you proved that you don\u2019t actually have any compassion for what she\u2019s been going through. She\u2019s absolutely right to go NC, because you proved that she can\u2019t actually rely on your support when the going gets tough. You are absolutely TA here.", "Oooh boy.  Massive YTA.  Look, I understand your wanting to talk to your daughter about this, and you want Adam to feel that his sister's happy for him and Clarissa, but this isn't the kind of thing you can force.  Sarah's going through a profoundly painful process where her younger brother is going to have a kid before her, and she's facing the possibility that she won't have any biological kids of her own.  She's going to need time to cope with this.  The best you can do is to continually let her know that you're there to support her.  \n\nAlso, being an aunt isn't the same thing as being a mother.  All it means is that there's a constant reminder that her brother had a kid and she hasn't (yet, hopefully).", "YTA. I agree that Sarah should not have been upset with her brother or cut him off since he didn't do anything wrong. You nonetheless skipped dozens of steps and went straight to berating her when common sense would tell you to start off asking how she's doing and sensing her time from there.", "Yta. Very obviously. Why is everyone mad at her for not immediately being happy. You are not entitled to her support as soon as you want it. Let her take time. If her brother and sil want her support isn't it normal then they should also support her by giving her time to adjust. She may have fertility issues or even her husband can have fertility issues. But you were quick to blame her for something she has no control over and something that already hurts her. Not the actions of a father who loves his daughter. I would go NC if my dad ever did this to me.", "YTA - So your daughter is struggling with fertility, she didn't react to the news of her SILs pregnancy with enough exhilaration for you, and she's been taking time to sort herself out. \n\nAnd instead of being sympathetic and offering her support when she's probably feeling like even more of a failure, you decided the best course of action was to leave her \"a very angry message\" that rubs it in her face that she can't be a mom but her SIL can, and as a consolation prize, she can spend time with everyone else's kids.  \n\nDad of the year right here folks!! (And since it's very clear that you don't understand nuance, I want to point out that the dad of the year comment was me being sarcastic.)", "Wait, did you leave her a voice mail or did you text her? Because your post is ambiguous.\n\nEither way, YTA all the way. You can't dictate Sarah's emotional reaction to the news. You told her how she should feel, and that's just wrong. Your wife was missing her, and now you've thrown up a huge obstacle to Sarah reconciling with your wife and with Adam just through your interference.\n\nThe only way to handle such a delicate situation is to be understanding and accepting of her and her feelings and be careful not to rub her face in Adam's good fortune. You missed that mark by a really long distance.", "YTA.  Honestly, you don\u2019t get to tell Sarah how to feel.", "YTA - being an insensitive buttinski isn't an excuse for rude behavior either.\n\nManaging your adult son's relationship with your adult daughter is not your business.   You should have tried harder at respecting her privacy.    \n\nYour angry message was unwarranted, counterproductive and stupid and you should apologize.   What right do you have to even be angry?", "YTA not just for how you worded the text, but why you sent it in the first place.\n\n>Adam's upset that his sister isn't happy for him, Clarissa is hurt that her sister-in-law isn't supportive, and my wife misses her daughter.\n\nYour daughter is spending tens of thousands of dollars and putting her body through who knows what to have a child, but you only see how it is affecting everyone else.\n\n>even if she can't have kids, she should be happy for her brother and that she can at least be an aunt.\n\nBy saying this, you\u2019re basically demanding that she accept something that\u2019s not decided yet. There may come a time when she needs to accept that she won\u2019t have a child, but not on your schedule.\n\nSo the end result is you basically told her to accept she won\u2019t have kids and instead focus on being an aunt to her brother\u2019s child. And given that you make sure to throw in the detail about med school, I would not be surprised if this was not the first time she was asked to do something like that.", "YTA. a complete YTA. what did you expect from her? an over the top congratulatory celebration? she\u2019s hurting and grieving. not only has she been trying for years, she\u2019s getting IVF treatments. do you know how much couples, especially women, have to sacrifice during these treatments? the medications, the injections, the appointments? everything is timed, it becomes consuming and she is suffering. instead of asking her how she is doing and supporting her with understanding, you criticize her because she didn\u2019t welcome the news like YOU wanted her too. read the damn room. you really jacked this up. don\u2019t be surprised if your relationship with your daughter never recovers. your insensitivity and lack of empathy shit all over it.", "YTA I was in your daughters shoes. I hated being around pregnant people and ended up being fine around babies. My dad was sad about it but he also knew he couldn\u2019t force me to be happy for my brother. I just felt grief and shame. Also how the f do you expect her to control her emotions when you clearly can\u2019t control your own anger?", "Yta,  she was fine, she said congratulation, she took sometime.   \n\nYou inserted yourself angrily into a situation that was in need of kindness and that was none of your business.    You owe a huge apology", "YTA YTA YTA\n\nI was in the same shoes as your daughter. My husband and I tried for kids for years. Tests, IVF, you name it. It takes its emotional toll on you and your partner. Nieces and nephews were born one after the other while my husband and I struggled. We took a step back from the family. We needed it.\n\nWe still went to family functions. We still fawned over our nieces and nephews. But when we needed space, we took it.

And it's your fault.", "YTA in the strongest possible terms. As an infertile person who has had four failed rounds of ivf, finding out close family members are pregnant is honestly one of the most crushing things me and my partner experience in our life now. All the trauma and hurt and grief resurfaces each and every time. You don\u2019t know, because you successfully had children. It is utterly soul destroying.\n\nPlease, please give your daughter the time and space she needs and respect her feelings in a devastating situation. She will be happy for her brother in her own way, but this is something she is going to find incredibly hard and that is not her fault. As her parent you should be supporting her in any way you can, not berating her.", "I am in this exact same position so I can explain to you. I am around Sarah\u2019s age and my husband and I have infertility issues for 3 years now. Around 3 years ago, my husband\u2019a brother (who is also around Adam\u2019s age) called us to let us know that he and his wife were expecting. We wished them well but I can tell you how broken I was inside. Infertility trauma has been shown by research to be as stressful as cancer or HIV. Often it\u2019s hard to see from the outside. You feel fragile and confused. You want to be happy for close people around you that get pregnant easily but it feels like a competition for no reason. It feels unfair that you came make sense of your journey or why you are being punished thus. With no end in sight, uncertainty looming large, not knowing when you will be triggered, exhausted from the meds, stressed abt every appointment and the bad news that follows - it\u2019s one of horrible roller coaster ride. \n\nAround the time my husband\u2019s sister in law delivered - I went into depression. Husbands parents were glowing at the prospect of the new grandchild. It made me sick to my stomach. I try to do the right thing in every situation but here I was at clash with my own value system. The resentment was strong. I couldn\u2019t even properly connect with the child till she was 1. Now that she is 1.5, we took a 2 week trip to spend time with her and we love her. I have made efforts for the sake of my husband to establish harmony and love. But if his parents had force joy on us, I would have cut my ties with everyone. I 100% understand Sarah\u2019s position. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s always best to give pregnancy announcements by text. Esp if you know they are going through infertility. Do not put them in a spot and force them to face their conflicting emotions with you on the phone. Everyone (except Sarah and Joey) are the assholes here. Just let the woman be and let her grieve for as long as she needs.

You seem to want to force her to not feel a certain way? Which is controlling and bizarre.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be frustrated with the situation, but your anger was the opposite of what you should have done\n\nIf you want an option for a better response, you could have said something like: \u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to overstep or meddle into your personal business, but I wanted to extend some love and support. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably feeling a certain way about your brothers news. Of course you don\u2019t have to tell us about any of that if you don\u2019t want to.

Those feelings should come from a place of compassion and understanding. If you feel frustration and anger, perhaps try to look at the situation differently or wait until you feel calmer to communicate", "YTA and big time! Yikes, no wonder your daughter doesn\u2019t want to talk to you! Your son and his wife\u2019s feelings aren\u2019t more important than your daughter\u2019s feelings. While yes, your son was disappointed that his sister wasn\u2019t \u201chappy enough,\u201d for him, she did send along some congratulations. Texting those congratulations was probably easier for her over text because of how sad she must\u2019ve been feeling, but that\u2019s good that she still sent them. \n\nAnd now, because your daughter isn\u2019t on your timeline you do an angry voicemail?! Why in the world would you think that was a good idea!? Your daughter is a person with her own feelings and her own timeline for processing information, don\u2019t rush it. \n\nBy the way: having feelings isn\u2019t \u201crude behavior,\u201d it\u2019s called being a human being!", "YTA - A million percent.

It's hard for her because her brother gets to have everything she wants. What do you want her to do, throw a freaking party? You're being extremely selfish and nasty and you should be ashamed of yourself. You have no idea how hard it is to know that what so many other people get to have will never be an option for you because you didn't have to go through that. But I did. And now your daughter is too. At least now she knows how awful you are so she'll know better than to turn to you for support since you're too selfish to give it.", "YTA congrats on making her feel worse. she can't force herself to be genuinely happy but she was civil with her brother. then you come along and rather than talk to her like an adult and see if she's okay, you went to instant asshole. so yes YTA for your crappy attitude", "YTA.

You're right she's handling badly and should be happy for her sibling.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID....she tried to disengage and you forced her hand. Why couldn't you give her the time she needs to process? She's probably thinking of years of watching her sibling's child grow up while her own womb remains empty. It's very heart breaking and you're all so self centered about this.\n\nCan't you just be happy for your grandchild that is on its way instead of rubbing your daughter's nose in her pain?

Did you really think being angry at her was going to help? Did it occur to you that she needs time to deal with this?

Sarah got married five years ago, Adam got married four years ago.  Sarah and her husband Joey (38M) have been trying for kids since they got married but got delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, and they are now going through IVF.  Adam and his wife Clarissa (32F) put off having kids for a couple of years while Adam was in med school, but then started trying for kids.  It's been really hard for Sarah and Joey to have kids, and there've been several complications, but things are now back on track.  However, due to the length of time it's taking, Sarah is becoming more and more depressed.  We're trying to support her, but there's only so much we can do.  The doctors haven't told her she can't have kids, but it's getting less and less likely as she grows older.\n\nAdam and Clarissa recently found out that they're expecting a child, much to their (and our) excitement.  However, they're hesitating about how to tell Sarah.  Adam really looks up to his older sister - they're very close, as my wife and I worked a lot when they were younger and my kids only had each other for a while.  Adam didn't want to cause his sister more emotional distress, but he wanted to tell her before Clarissa became very pregnant.  Adam decided to just call Sarah and tell her directly, and from what he told us later, she did not take it well... at all.  She wished him a perfunctory 'congratulations', and has been incommunicado since then.  We tried to respect her privacy while she processed this, but eventually I had had enough.  Adam's upset that his sister isn't happy for him, Clarissa is hurt that her sister-in-law isn't supportive, and my wife misses her daughter.  \n\nEventually I called Sarah, got her voicemail, and left her a very angry message telling her that even if she can't have kids, she should be happy for her brother and that she can at least be an aunt.  Sarah sent me one angry text message with a lot of expletives and told me not to contact her again.  When I showed this to my wife, she got upset at me and said that I should've worded the text nicer, but I said that infertility isn't an excuse for rude behavior.\n\nSo, AITA for this text and my attitude towards my daughter?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "A soft YTA\nShe's old enough to know better.\nHowever, when dealing with infertility it's such a deep seated emotional trauma for many woman on many levels that while you telling her to shape up isn't wrong...it was the entirely wrong thing to do.\nApologize, tell her you love her (because you do right?), and ask her how you can make amends because all you truely want is your family to be happy together.\nBe the bigger person", "ESH because some things said were insensitive but someone needed to tell Sarah to get over herself. Being infertile doesn\u2019t give you a reason to be B. If she can spend money on IVF she can spend money to foster to adopt.", "YTA but then so is Sarah.  Her inability to have kids is absolutely no excuse for not being happy for her brother.  You should have just said nothing.  I would be willing to bet if Sarah does eventually get pregnant, she would be furious if her brother is not excited for her.  She can't have it both ways.", "NTA. You were absolutely right.", "INFO: Do you think your parents would be proud of the way you are treating your daughter? Is this cruelty the way they raised you to be?", "YTA... no need to elaborate.", "So you left your daughter a voicemail message but your wife says you should have worded your \"text\" message nicer and you are asking if YTA based on this \"text\"?\n\nNice try with the ragebait, but remember to keep your story straight for your next creative writing exercise.\n\nOh, and YTA.", "YTA - why would you be angry with her? Sure, she maybe could have handled it better but she\u2019s going through something really hard. Why did you think getting angry was going to achieve? She probably feels worse now.", "Sorry OP, you handled this terribly. I have an awful habit of seeing both sides of the story. I understand you are upset that your daughter couldn\u2019t be happy for her brother but, see it from her perspective- the news would\u2019ve cut deep and she was hurt. By lashing out at her you have caused her more pain. I would apologise to her and then give her time. She will hopefully come around to the idea of being an aunty, but that does not smooth over the fact that she isn\u2019t yet a mother. Be considerate of her feelings.", "YTA.  Do you actually want a continuing relationship with Sarah?  Because you're destroying any chances of that happening in the future.", "YTA, this is spilling a lot of my personal stuff but as someone who was told we would need fertility treatments and IVF possibly to get pregnant I understand sarah 100% its so hard seeing people have babies, get pregnant, and all of that without getting extremely depressed or upset, it sucks, you don't want to feel like that but you just do. I bet you never truly supported her by your reaction to her probably just trying to process and actually be happy while also grieving too. unrelated but now we are expecting our baby girl as a surprise and I am sending sarah all the baby dust and hopefully she will cut ya'll off when she does get pregnant.", "YTA\n\nAs  someone who had 10 miscarriages along with IVF and everything in between I can tell you right now I wouldn't speak to you again... Or even botjer turning up to your funeral.", "YTA\n\nMassive, massive asshole.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t even your business - *you\u2019re* not having the child, your son is. I really can\u2019t fathom why you thought it was\n\n1) anything to do with you and therefore your place to mend any bridges (read: interfere)\n\n2) a good or reasonable idea to give your daughter, ya know, the person that *is* your child, abuse over it", "YTA.\n\nI lost my parents when I was in my 30s, I lost my husband when I was 47\u2014and I *still* rate infertility as one of the hardest, most painful things I've been through in my life. \"She should be happy for her brother and that she can at least be an aunt\" is so blisteringly insensitive, I can't even.\n\nI know that infertility revealed an ugly jealousy within myself that I wish I'd never seen. Had someone exploded at me the way you lashed out at Sarah, that hardly would have helped.", "YTA. \n\nShe congratulate her brother and then, Im assuming, she went processing this news and the fact she isnt pregnant and maybe will never be. It is a lot for someone who has a dream of become a parent to ear this news. \n\nYou cant possibly believe that a >depressed< woman, who have been trying to have kids for years, would react in a different way! Actually, sometimes this womens react in a very bad way! But she didnt! She respect the news her brother gave her, and when the time is right Im sure she will step up and talk to him! \n\nWhile her brother can be sad, you were way over the line!! Instead of reaching to her and ask her how is she doing hersfelf and with the news, you attacked her!!! Instead of helper her process this, you made it worse!! She wasnt rude, you were!", "YTA. She took time to herself to process her feelings. You did not need to get involved.", "YTA\n\nI don't know what you thought you might achieve over berating your daughter and throwing her infertility in her face. If you were my dad, I wouldn't talk to you for a very, very long time. \n\nPeople are so worried about their own picture of perfection, do you even care about your kids feelings?", "YTA - I'm glad you're not my parent.", "YTA why in the hell are you meddling in your children business? They are in their 30\u2019s. Sounds like she took it fine and is taking time to process. She\u2019s not making a huge deal out of it and even said congrats. You on the other hand couldn\u2019t help yourself. Good job on making it way worse. She can\u2019t even process without her nosy helicopter parent inserting themselves in tho this. I\u2019m sure her getting chewed out by one of her parents helped her get over it. Keep going and don\u2019t be surprised if she doesn\u2019t talk to you either.", "YTA. I don't want any kids, and even I can clearly see how the news would distress Sarah enough to the point where she'd need some time to herself.\n\nInstead of granting her that time, you decided to blow up on her, rubbing her infertility in her face.", "YTA - I wouldn\u2019t wish 5 years of infertility on anyone. It\u2019s 60 months of scheduled and highly orchestrated relations with your spouse, of wondering whether a weird feeling or pain was a pregnancy symptom or the effects of fertility medication, and of getting so desperate you start trying all the weird sh!t peddled on fertility subs. \nYes, she should be happy for her brother, but I\u2019m not sure what you want if \u201ccongratulations\u201d wasn\u2019t good enough. What kind of support does the sister-in-law actually need? Certainly SIL can understand girl talk over the joy& difficulty of pregnancy would be excruciating for Sarah, or is Sarah the only one who has to put her own feelings away for everyone else?\nYou kicked your daughter when she was at her lowest. I\u2019m gonna guess it wasn\u2019t the first time.", "It sounds like she responded fine?  Congratulated them and tried to handle her complex feelings without interfering with anyone else\u2019s excitement by keeping to herself. She was probably very happy for them but struggling with feelings of failure and jealousy. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect her to not experience negative emotions. Treating her as if she did something hurtful for having private feelings and taunting her for her inability to become pregnant so far was obviously a poor choice. Of course YTA.", "You've got to be kidding.  Of course YTA, what kind of mother are you?", "YTA\n\nIf infertility is no excuse to be rude, what's your excuse for being an asshole? You called up your daughter and left her an angry voicemail for what? Because she hadn't gotten over her feelings fast enough? She wasn't being rude, but you sure as hell were. Even your wife, who you pretend is the aggrieved party here, thinks you're an asshole. Oh, and Adam and Clarissa are likely upset because they feel they hurt Sarah (unintentionally of course) with the news. Your genius response was to hurt her intentionally to solve an issue that literally had nothing to do with you. Get a clue, man.", "YTA.  Your children are grown and can figure out their relationship without your interference.  I'm sorry for Sarah's fertility issues and happy for your new grandchild.  You can feel both at the same time.", "YTA. Your daughter was polite and retreated to process on her own. She didn't make herself the center of attention. \n\nInstead of being supportive and bringing her back in gently you reacted with completely unwarranted anger. \n\nIf I was her I'd cut you off at least for a good while.", "Of course YTA.\n\nYour daughter isn\u2019t being mean. She is going through a very difficult thing emotionally. I\u2019m sure she is happy for her brother, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t deeply painful for her.\n\nYou should have minded your own fucking business. Shame on you.", "YTA. Showing anger to a daughter who is grieving is really insensitive. Favor the boy child much?", "YTA. ***Why*** would you leave her an angry voicemail?!!  You may not appreciate how Sarah is handling her SIL's pregnancy, but you have no right to be ***angry*** about it! \n\nThink it through, given her state of mind, did you really think that leaving such a message would help the situation?  Or was it just more important for you to blow up at her, regardless of the consequences, because you were annoyed at her behavior?  \n\nYou have no idea what your daughter is going through, OP, and you were judgmental and mean.  The hormones your daughter is taking can affect her personality,and cause depression, the whole process can be exhausting, and physically painful, you have no idea.  \n\nYou aren't right in this situation.  Anger is also an inappropriate response to infertility, Dad.  I would beg your daughter for forgiveness in person if I were you.  If she won't see you, maybe your wife should call your daughter's husband if she isn't responding to her directly and offer support to them both.", "YTA!  You seem to be expecting her to do cartwheels and that is just unrealistic. You have no idea the emotional trauma going through ivf can create.   The sight of a child can create a deeper depression in women and you want her to be excited?", "absolutely YTA. this was not for you to step in on. you should have left your daughter alone to process, no matter how long it took. you majorly overstepped and sounds like it cost you your relationship. you need to apologize and accept when she continues to not want contact.", "Sometimes it just takes an outsider's point of view.", "I hadn't thought about it from this perspective. \n\nThank you internet stranger", "Exactly. It took me 10 years and 3 rounds of IVF to have my son. In the meantime, friends and family were reproducing all over the shop! Hearing yet another person is pregnant while you\u2019re still not is immeasurably hard, and so totally unfair. OP\u2019s daughter reacted in the best way she could - she congratulated them, then went off quietly to grieve. All you\u2019ve managed to do, OP, is push her even further away, further into her grief, and she feels like you don\u2019t support her, or that you expect her to just get over her fertility. She can\u2019t do that. She told you she needs time, give her that. But don\u2019t leave her alone completely, either you or your wife should contact her to let her know that you do understand, and that you\u2019re there for her.\n\nI get that your intentions were good, but the delivery was way off. YTA.", "This is the way \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "This is really perfectly said. Thank you. As someone who has been there it is nearly impossible to convey to others what you are thinking, feeling, experiencing. I had a massive meltdown when my sister ADOPTED another child and I still had none. It hits you hard and in weird ways and can lurk for ages and pop out unexpectedly.", "Tell her brother to put a damper on his happiness and be sad for her, and you\u2019ll see how ridiculous it is.", "that's not why he's TA, personally i find it easier to have conversations over text because i can pause to collect my thoughts. telling his daughter to just get over possible infertility instantly is why he's TA, regardless of medium.", "She likely took time to process the news. If someone else's happy occasion makes you upset for any reason (like reminding her she likely can't have that in this case), taking time off to process by yourself can be a good thing. That way she doesn't put her feelings onto her brother, which would likely put a damper on his happiness. \n\nSure, she could've explained better, but she probably IS upset - not at her brother, but at her situation. That is perfectly understandable, and yelling at her won't change that.", "she probably needed time to process", "I think he left her a voicemail and then his daughter replied by text (not sure 100% though)", "She didn\u2019t do anything wrong though. She told her brother congratulations and instead of distracting from their happy occasion she took time for herself. There is nothing wrong with having feelings especially when she is not detracting from her brother", "That\u2019s just it.  Grief has no rules and can pop out at the worst times.  I\u2019m sorry for your\u2026it sucks that there is no real word for this as it\u2019s technically not a loss, but it is in so many ways. You\u2019re not alone.", "So you don\u2019t consider yourself A H? I do. Grief still makes A Hs", "Yeah. People seem to think it\u2019s ok to be raging B for being infertile and spending money on IVF. Instead of being happy for brother Sarah made it about herself.", "And how long to let deplorable having continue because of grief. Have none of you actually been to a therapist?", "This.  She didn't cut him off permanently. She just needed some space to process while everyone else was celebrating the happy news. It's really hard to be happy when someone close to you has gotten the one thing you've been desperate for and can't have. She doesn't want to take that away from her brother, so she's keeping her distance until it settles down.\n\nAnd here comes Dad, telling her to suck it up and be happy that *someone* in this family has finally managed to get pregnant."]}
