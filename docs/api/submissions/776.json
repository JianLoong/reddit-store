So after that she finally got her stuff which took her even longer. Than she sat down and yelled who said that and i said it was me.And after that she just started yelling at me and telling me if i wanted to go outside with her.Which i said no because if i get in an altercation i get suspended and kicked out of my college classes.After that she kept in with her yelling match . I told i didn\u2019t care it was her birthday and she got even madder. Later on the bus ride she started calling me and my friend (were Mexican btw) racism remarks and  and that\u2019s we were a couple of s***s kept going on about how were dirty Mexican b****s  and i just didn\u2019t respond because i care about my future. I still don\u2019t know why she took it so far.
