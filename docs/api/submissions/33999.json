I was carrying our child, and she was pushing the trolley, with me a couple of steps in front of her.

Seeing my wife behind this woman, I motioned for her to come around since I was ahead and ready to start unloading our items and checking out.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where things took a turn. The woman behind me got upset and accused me of cutting in line, arguing that she should be first because my trolley wasn't with me; it was behind her. Ordinarily, I might have let it slide, but her accusatory attitude rubbed me the wrong way. Despite having no particular urgency, her tone prompted me to stand my ground.\r  \n\r  \nI explained to her that I had joined the queue before her, and since my wife and I were together, our collective position took priority. She countered, insisting that the physical location of the trolley mattered more, claiming I couldn't hold the spot for someone else. Our exchange continued with the same arguments until she eventually gave up and moved to another queue.\r  \n\r  \nTo the best of my knowledge, the UK follows a \"first come, first serve\" rule for queuing, and I believe that by bringing my wife to my position, I wasn't violating any norms.

Your wife wasn't right behind you, or the other woman wouldn't have been there. She was right. Like, I guess you would be okay if you're in a line up for something and some people arrive late and jump in front because those are their friends and they're together. No. Back of the line.", "YTA. Using your logic, you could come into the grocery store and stand in line while your wife shops, and she\u2019s still entitled to cut in front of others when she\u2019s ready to join you.", "Yeah, YTA. She's right. If you'd had the cart and your wife joined you, or if you didn't have a cart and only a few items, I'd be in your side, but your wife had the cart, so you were a queue jumper here.

I've had people bum rush to get line for no reason just for my partner in front to turn around n grab our cart. Some people will disagree and some won't.

Either way I still leave with my groceries lol.", "If this woman slipped in between you and your wife quickly, all that was required was for your wife to say \"excuse me I'm with him\". However it sounds like you and your wife may not have been close as you didn't even realise she wasn't behind you for a short time. And she stood there in line behind this woman for a while before you eventually said something. This woman likely choose your line thinking the only person in front of her is a guy with a couple items. Now your changing the script and asking her to let a whole cart full of food cut in front. I would agree with her that people can't stand in line saving space for a cart while their partner is shopping. Sounds like YTA.", "YTA - It's one thing to have someone pop out of the line and grab one or two things to go with an already full cart in a way that won't meaningfully change the amount of time it takes you to check out. Getting in line with a couple of things and then having someone else cut the line with a cart full is a seriously rude and entitled move.", "Also in the uk.

And it sounds like you were rude as well, so YTA x 3 at least.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t cut. You were walking together and it sounds like this lady snaked in between you. I assume you\u2019re paying (or you\u2019re jointly paying) for the groceries. This woman can bugger off", "YTA.  You can't save a space in a grocery queue. You get the position available when you AND your cart arrive. The person behind you was in front of your groceries. You were just the a-hole trying to cheat.\n\nWhat is the matter with you? How entitled can you get?  You should have learned to wait your turn when you were in kindergarten. Everyone around you saw you as the AH you are.  I wonder how else you express this entitlement in public.

We choose our checkout based on how many/full the trolleys in front of us are. Honestly think you just need to consider how you'd feel in the woman's position, maybe passing on a checkout that would have been quicker had you known upfront.", "YTA you weren\u2019t \u201cfirst come first serve\u201d bc your stuff wasn\u2019t there.

If you'd had the trolley and your wife was collecting a few bits, that would be a different matter but you can't just reserve a spot when  you don't even have your shopping with you. You were wrong.", "YTA. Sounds like she just called you our on your shit and you just didn't want to hear it.", "This seems crazy to me. You were together with your wife and a woman stood behind you because your wife was a couple of *seconds* behind you. This is a simple misunderstanding that she blew out of proportions. You weren't cutting in line, you were just taking a spot for both you and your wife. I was in that woman's shoes a couple of times and while it's a little annoying Im not crazy to blow my lid over waiting extra three minutes in a queue. NTA I live in UK for a couple of years for reference.", "You basically stood in a parking spot while your wife was still down the parking lot lane.", "Nothing more to add other than YTA.", "YTA, and in the UK I believe you have earned a disapproving round of tutting from all and sundry.", "NTA\n\nSending one of the kids to stand in line while mom was shopping was normal when I was growing up and we were shopping during busy times.  At times my husband and I will both pick a line and the ones that moves fastest is the one we checkout in.", "YTA. You were first with your items and could have been served by yourself. The other person was behind you and was next. Then your wife got in line with the cart and would have been next. You told your wife to cut the line. Rude. Thisbalso would have been rude in America (and presumably Canada) if that's where you're from.\n\nIf you guys had been in opposite spots, and the person with a thing or two added some items to the cart, that would have been fine (assuming 1 transaction)", "I\u2019m going with YTA as it is much easier to move without a cart. You moved ahead to get in line because of this. It is no different when people get in line for rides at a theme park and have one person que for the entire group. Then have everyone else jump the line. If you are separated from your group in a line, the person furthest back is where everyone meets up. The only real exception is if someone needs to step out of line to use the restroom (especially a small child). Baring something like that, you were being rude.", "YTA", "In the circumstances YTA\n\nIf I joined a queue thinking someone had a couple of items & then they let someone in with an entire cart I'd be ticked off too.\n\nYou don't get to save a spot in a supermarket queue which is what you did here.", "Sorry, she\u2019s right. You cut the line. It\u2019s one thing for someone to go grab an item they forgot while their flatly member waits in line with the cart, but you saved a spot in line with no groceries at all. And then waved your wife\u2019s whole cart around her whole cart. That\u2019s obnoxious. She was right to call you out on it. Even your title indicates that you tried to gaslight her. \n\nEveryone in the world picks their grocery line based on how much groceries the people in front of them have. So you majorly inconvenienced this woman. \n\nYTA", "I agree, OP ought to have made sure his wife was beside him when he joined the queue at the checkout. His logic is as daft as someone expecting to be able to save a space in a carpark, it doesn't work that way. First come, first served. It really is that simple.", "Yep. I had this happen to me just yesterday. A man with a small transaction was checking out so I got into line behind him, as opposed to the line with three people, thinking I would be outta there faster. Unfortunately for me, both his wife and son kept coming back with additional grocery items and adding them to the man's transaction. \n\nIt's sucky when people do this, although are no rules about it. If the man in front of me, or if OP, had informed the people behind him in line that he had a much larger order, I would've been grateful and could've acted accordingly.\n\nI agree that, while OP didn't do anything \"wrong\" according to the strict rules, he was, indeed, an asshole.", "I don\u2019t think you read it correctly.

She didn't have to right off the bat be accusatory of cutting and whatnot. People don't have to let you go ahead of them just because you have less stuff. Is it kind to do? Absolutely it's not required though. Maybe lines do work differently there, idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f first come, first serve is generally how it works though in my experience", "A woman was in line in front of me and let in her friend with another hugely full cart.
