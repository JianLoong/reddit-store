She\u2019s in the wrong!", "INFO to clarify for my tired brain: when you said \u201cthe woman behind me\u201d in the second paragraph, do you mean the one behind you *after* you let the other woman past? And did you join the queue without realising your wife wasn\u2019t right behind you? \n\nA lot of the comments seem to be from Americans, so I think it could come down to cultural differences. Here in Australia, what you did wouldn\u2019t be a huge issue if you didn\u2019t realise your wife wasn\u2019t directly behind you. AFAIK we\u2019re quite similar with etiquette as the UK. It\u2019s not like you waited in a long queue and held your spot for ages while your wife continued to shop. Some people might be iffy about it if they\u2019re in a mood, but I don\u2019t think it would escalate to this point. \n\nThis has happened to me before when I\u2019ve been with my mum. She didn\u2019t realise I wasn\u2019t with her as I got stuck behind people standing in the middle of the walkway to the checkouts and I couldn\u2019t get past.

Having the trolley is the line marker.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t have the items that you needed to pay for, your wife did, and thus her position is what matters. You essentially did that thing assholes do where one person stands in a parking spot and saves it for their spouse driving the car - though grocery store thing is much less douchey imo. I don\u2019t think what you did is terrible and you should be chewed out for it (personally I would have never gotten mad at someone for their spouse cutting me in line - it\u2019s not that big a deal) but you were definitely in the wrong.", "You and your partner hadn\u2019t completed your shopping by the time the other person was in the queue. *You* cut the line. YTA", "I'm in the US so I can only speak for my country, but here when someone is in line/holding a place in line , it counts. It sucks sometimes for those in the back when you're like , \"oh cool , they only have one item \" & then someone they're with comes with a huge ass cart , but as you said , first come first served. No sense whining about it ( although I might quietly groan or roll my eyes). Edit to add: I especially expect it of couples although I also see people who aren't couples but still came together  doing it. I'm not going to fight them over it. Now if some random person comes out of nowhere & cuts in front then I speak up.", "YTA. I love that the comments are unanimously YTA even though you tried to paint it as a family issue with your child. Come on. She may have had children at home and grocery shopped on her own. You sir... Are an ASSHOLE HERE!", "Agree sounds like YTA. The cart  trolley) dictates the line  position.", "Sorry but YTA. That scenario only works in your favor if your wife has 1 or 2 items. For a full trolley to cut the line, it's more like you tried to 'reserve' a spot in line by standing there, which is extremely rude. 1 or 2 items does not add to the delay of the people behind you. A full trolly certainly does. You exceeded the acceptable tolerances for cutting in line. Accept your judgement and stop being like that.", "YTA \n\nIt is first come first serve... you, and what items you personally had with you were first, then the lady behind you was next. Your wife was the third to come and should be the third to be served. Not that difficult to understand. \n\nLike imagine you're in line for entry somewhere when suddenly the person in front of you is joined by a dozen other people and argues they're allowed to cut you because their group counts \"collectively.\" You'd be rightly pissed.", "I could see this situation making a good Seinfeld episode. I\u2019m going to go with YTA though. She likely picked that register since there wasn\u2019t anyone with a bunch of items. I\u2019m sure it was annoying to suddenly realize you waved your wife with a full cart", "YTA, your cart wasn't there first. You cut the line and you are the person everyone hates in line.", "Haha I will run right over them", "OP is definitely an AH", "He was only \"a couple of steps ahead\".  That's still together.", "The way other folks in the comments are reacting, it's like the wife was in the next store over and OP + baby were staking their claim.\n\nBut if I read the post right, what actually happened is that OP was just ahead of his wife, who had the cart, got in line, turned back and another lady had cut in front of the wife with her trolley, not realizing OP and his wife were together. She then took it out on OP when he tried to bring his wife back to him. \n\nUnfortunately, this happens with me and my husband all the time when we grocery shop. We get separated because people are super pushy near the register. I had a lady on Christmas Eve give me the nastiest look because I nipped over to the next register to grab some candy for my husband. He was in line about to unload the trolley, so all I was doing was joining him once more with the item he wanted. But the lady glared at me like I was committing murder.\n\nThe main thing we do is make sure whoever has the cart is in front and is the one picking the line.\n\nBut in this case, I'd go with an ESH. I don't think it was intentional, but someone needed to give and the easier person to move at this point was OP. In the amount of time they spent bickering, both trolleys could have easily gotten through the line.", "Or send him ahead with the cart to get started while you pick up the last items.", "That doesn't make any sense. He was in line first, and he and his wife were paying together. He is NTA at all.", "This happens sometimes to me too or the other way around. No one cares. Though, usually the person with the cart is usually the one waiting in line while the other person runs around to grab stuff lol. Once I got in line behind someone and their cart and then the rest of their group came up with another cartful of groceries. No big deal. I either continue to wait in line or look for a shorter line.", "What was he unloading? His baby? Wife had the cart. OP had the baby. OP essentially ran ahead to save a spot with nothing worth checking out, cutting off the other lady.", "Saw something similar that might put it in perspective for OP.  I was at the supermarket and saw a shopper with multiple family members send one member to 3 different lines.  The shopper with the cart jumped in with the member who was closest to the checkout when they arrived with their cart.  It was totally intentional and a dick move holding and then taking the best spot in front of a number of shoppers who lined up with their carts to respectfully wait their turn.  OP might have unintentionally cut, but the result was the same.  Most people wouldn't say anything, as it's also not really cool to get pissed and confront people about such trivial things in public.  That doesn't mean OP wasn't in the wrong as they seem to think.\n\nOP YTA.", "Exactly this!", "This is the key point, OP. You got to the queue first because you didn\u2019t have your groceries with you. That\u2019s like trying to save a parking space in a busy shopping center. Run around, find a spot, stand there and save it until your spouse can park the car. Would you do that? YTA", "Agreed! It makes perfect sense when shopping as a couple to have one person go get in line while the other finishes up. They aren't shopping as individuals, they are shopping as a couple, it's not like they are paying on separate transactions.", "Agree - this is a grocery line, everyone needs to get a grip. Imagine arguing with a young family with a little kid that you should go first because you managed to squeeze in between them. \n\nTIL exactly how serious Brits are about the sacred queue \ud83d\ude06", "The way I read it, he thought his wife was right behind him and didn't notice she was a little further behind, in which case the shopping was done and they were just a few paces apart. People can get pushy at checkouts.", "I love how confident he\u2019s on his position \ud83e\udd23\n\nIF you are making the line before your shopping partner, YOU wait with the trolley. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with the extra shopping partner grabbing one or two things while you make the line WITH trolley and your partner comes with a bag of potatoes and milk. But to stand with nothing and then have her push over the trolley is a dick move.", "I hate it when people do this! Once a person left their very full cart in line to hold their spot while they kept shopping. The rest of the line moved on so I moved in front of the cart. I was also buying exactly one item. \n\nShe came back and started yelling at me about cutting in line. Like, dude, I am not slowing you down!  You can\u2019t just park your cart in line.", "Well, when there are a lot of people in the store I see people doing this.", "That's a bit much.", "Wow, judgemental much? He made a mistake and it was at the other lady's expense, unfortunately.  But jeez, you don't have to go full out on him and assume he is always an AH.", "YTA because you each have your own carts full of food and you each got in line seperately, so you weren't really shopping together. So the lady was right, you let your wife do a \"chat and cut\" which is really not okay.  Either you jump back to her with your cart or you each check out seperately in the line.", "Do you realize that not everyone on Reddit is American, and that they might not be using American English?", "I once had a family ask if they could go ahead of us because they were really there first, it was just that the attendant had questions about their youngest's height.  I had seen the discussion as I entered the line, so I said \"Sure\" and let them by.  Ten minutes later they had 5 more people come through the line to cut in front of us because they \"had to get snacks.\"  That's what this guy would be like.", "They were walking to the queue together, and he was a few steps in front. It is obvious that the other Woman cut his Wife off somewhere along the way. He wasn't just standing there and waiting while his Wife shopped.\n\nNTA", "Idk about the car space comparison. Those people are always wrong. Those are people trying to claim a space for a car when there is another car already about to park. If they were holding up the line and cashier waiting for the cart to get there, then yes absolutely the same but here it\u2019s more a soft YTA since most people pick their lines from how long they appear. \n\nAlso seems like OP only \u2018fought\u2019 back because he perceived the woman as giving him attitude. If I think someone is being an ass in how they talk to me, then I will 100% inconvenience them in spite. Def wrong to do but at that point I don\u2019t really care about being an asshole so if that was the type of sass he was getting I don\u2019t think he should let this bother him", "This happened to me, a woman was stood in the only spare car parking space in the car park, \u201csaving it\u201d for her husband who was nowhere to be seen.\n\nI just carried on reversing into the spot so she had to move. She was screeching at me the whole time.", "He had no idea how far she was behind him.\n\n\"As I joined the checkout line, I turned back to locate my wife and noticed another woman with her trolley behind me.\"", "Yeah people are acting like he stood in line while his wife finished shopping or something (which IS an AH move, I will never think it\u2019s okay to just keep adding items, don\u2019t go to the checkout until you\u2019re done even for just a couple items but this seems to bother people less here when I think that\u2019s so much more rude???) or that he sprinted ahead and she took another ten minutes to get there when she was just a bit slower than he was unknowingly and the other lady swooped in. There wasn\u2019t like a huge significant time frame between when he got in line and she caught up\n\nSome people are saying the wife should\u2019ve said \u201cI\u2019m with him excuse me\u201d as a compromise and I don\u2019t have a problem with that, but if we\u2019re being honest most of the YTA commenters and this lady sound as if that wouldn\u2019t have been allowed either because \u201che was saving the spot\u201d\n\nBut I do think OP made it into a bigger fight than it needed to be.", "Paying together is irrelevant. They weren't walking together, and they weren't in the queue together. She was behind the other woman. At the back of the queue. \n\n\nIf OP wanted to check out with his wife, he should have gone back to her instead of 'promoting' her in front of someone who was there first.", "This happens in Costco all the time, and I get it because that line gets long. And if I\u2019m by myself sucks for me but I wouldn\u2019t cry because some else sent their husband or older kid to save a spot in line.", "Right it's such a small thing for me. It's funny usually women will try and push me with my child in cart rushing to the line.", "Thanks I read it wrong I thought he said he was ahead of her unloading items but he said he was ahead of her \u2018ready to\u2019 unload items.", "I saw a family doing this the other day too! It was super weird & all the lines were short already so it seemed extra unnecessary. I hope this doesn't become some sort of weird \"checkout hack\".", "Fair point. I might\u2019ve misread it. \n\nBut he might\u2019ve over-exaggerated how nearby his wife was (to make himself seem like less of an AH)\n\nHonestly, I\u2019d have to see the store\u2019s security footage to be able to decide for sure \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo I\u2019ll withdraw my YTA in exchange for an ESH (unless someone has that footage? lol)", "\u201cJudgmental much\u201d like yeah\u2026 that\u2019s literally the whole point \ud83d\ude02", "Do you realize that OP said \"line\" several times in his post, then switched to \"queue?\"", "It is not obvious.", "Sounds like his wife needs to wake up and pay attention if that happened so easily and the husband didn\u2019t notice until the lady had been there for at least some time however", "She was behind the woman, but he was in front of the women, and they are a single unit because they are paying together. \n\nIt perfect makes sense when shopping together as a couple for one person to go hold a place in line while the other finishes up.

We can never be sure unless someone gives us the tapes!!!", "For all you know it happened right before he queued. The fact of the matter is he was there first, and his Wife was right there as well. How or when the Woman cut his Wife off is beside the point.", "I don't agree. I think we must come from different cultures. I would find it extremely rude and selfish for someone to be holding a place in the queue like that.\n\n\nI'm guessing you and OP must be American because this sort of behaviour is absolutely beyond the pale and would be frowned upon in the UK.

It's just not the done thing in a civilised society.", "Where exactly in the world would this make perfect sense? If you don\u2019t have the trolley then you don\u2019t get into line, there is no such thing as saving a space in a supermarket queue.
