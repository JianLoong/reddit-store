They\u2019re both in elementary school and the schools here are tougher than their old one. The older one is barely passing and there\u2019s good chance the youngest might be held back this year. I want to set them up for success but we\u2019re having an argument about how much input I have.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t push the kids and when they bring home bad grades, she tells them they should do better but doesn\u2019t show them how. Her entire family does not place an emphasis on education. Consequently, every single one of them have jobs that do not pay well. Her parents and all of her aunts and uncles are working well into their 70s and 80s because they can\u2019t afford to retire. They also have this weird thing where if someone does something well, like get good grades, everyone else will accuse them of thinking they\u2019re better than the rest of the family. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before.\n\nMy family push each other to do well in school and because of that, everyone have comfortable careers. My parents retired in their 50s and I\u2019m on the same trajectory. We have a familial agreement where we\u2019ll send each other\u2019s kids to certain people to be tutored. For example, everyone send their kids to me with biology and chemistry problems because those are my specialty. They all send their kids to my cousin Jane to learn how to study because that\u2019s what she teaches. \n\nI started to take my step kids to Jane so she can teach them the basics of how to study efficiently and effectively. It\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t handle and we go twice a week for an hour at a time. At first my fianc\u00e9e agreed but earlier in the week she said I was pushing the kids too hard. I don\u2019t think I am but our conversation turned into an argument. I argued that they need to learn how to study and they need good grades in order to get into good careers. She argued that grades doesn\u2019t matter to which I pointed out my company doesn\u2019t even interview college graduates with GPAs below a 3.5. In the heat of the moment, I pointed out that her parents are working at minimum wage jobs in their 70s because they thought grades weren\u2019t important either.\n\nNow she\u2019s sleeping in the main bedroom while I\u2019m waking up in the guest bedroom.

My family sees hard work as meaning something and desk jobs as pretentious. Since they are not your kids, you and your fiance need to be on the same page.

Do you realise that this is going to be how she will want to parent those children, too? You'll be fighting each other over this constantly. These are the very important conversations you need to have, now. Do not marry her until you come to an agreement about it.\n\nBut frankly, I doubt you'll reach an agreement. Not with attitudes towards education that are SO far apart. And if I were you, I would find your fianc\u00e9es attitude to be supremely unattractive.

There is a real educational crisis currently, with students not prepared academically or emotionally to get through school, but that's another issue.\n\nHowever, you should ask your fiance why she said you were pushing her kids too hard.

You should have talked it out before denying that you were pushing them, and then attacking her parents.\n\nSo YTA for what you said about your fiance's parents.  Some things may be true, but don't need to be thrown in someone's face.  Now she thinks you think you are judging them as inferior due to their lack of education, and she's offended.\n\nOP, before you and your fiance get married, and especially if you plan to have children of your own, maybe some premarital counseling is in order.  You two appear to have different values when it comes to education and what a \"successful\" life looks like.

It's just ... cruel.", "> Other people think working minimum wage at 70 is success.\n\nWorking minimum wage at age 70 now is very different from working minimum wage 50 years ago. By the time those kids are adults, there's a high likelihood that minimum wage will have degraded even MORE relative to cost of living. There will no longer be even the *slightest* shred of justification to argue that it's anything even resembling \"success,\" because they will be doomed to poverty and suffering. There's a high likelihood that they won't even make it to 70, because life expectancy in the US for the impoverished is now going *down* and nobody is doing anything to reverse that trend.\n\nIf your definition of \"success\" involves consigning children to endless suffering with no escape for their entire lives, then I think it's not a very good definition. Poverty fundamentally changes people's bodies. It's destructive on a basic biological level. And you would never say, \"well, my definition of success is people not having food to eat or a place to live or access to medical care.\" \n\nThey don't need to go to college or work a 9-5. There are plenty of definitions of \"success\" that don't involve those things. People can learn trades, or start businesses, or find other work with opportunity for monetary advancement that ISN'T minimum wage. There's no reason to draw this false dichotomy between the college-to-corporate pipeline and wages that are literally insufficient for sustaining life; there are SO many options between those two things. Plenty of jobs that involve manual labor still pay way more than minimum wage.\n\nIn order to have anything except that worst-case scenario, these kids DO need SOME tools to help them escape the horror that is being ground under the boot heel of capitalism, inescapably, for the rest of their lives. Minimum wage at 70 means a lifetime of suffering and that is NOBODY'S definition of success. If anyone legitimately thinks that their children should NEVER make more than minimum wage, and thus should never have enough food and should never have health care and should always be one unexpected bill away from homelessness, then those people are assholes, and you cannot say N A H.\n\nNow, if you had said \"Other people think working a different kind of job that still makes enough money to be able to eat, live, get health care, and not be driven to an early grave is success,\" I would have agreed with you about the N A H. But that's not what you said.", "Kids often times do not know when they need help and in this case, it\u2019s irrelevant if they want his help.\n\nElementary school is easy and no one should be barely passing or be held back.

They require a 3.5 GPA for new grads because they don\u2019t have a solid background in the industry. The thinking is that college is easy and if you can\u2019t maintain a high B average in college, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to be able to quickly absorb all of the new info and be productive. They train and mentor new grads but no one here has the time to hold their hands and baby them.", "I\u2019m sorry about your friend. \nWith that being said, these are elementary school students, and we are talking about 2 hours a week to help them learn independent study habits. He\u2019s giving them the resources to not get burnt out. Imagine being one of those kids, no priority ever set for higher education, but they decide in high school that they want to pursue a college education, but have never been shown the path to get there. Imagine their frustration and struggle that they will face. They will struggle with their self worth, fear for their future and face so much disappointment when they are turned down. This man is simply trying to give them a full toolbox, if they choose to build something with it, that\u2019s their decision.", "Doesn't reddit aita says that if you marry a woman with kids those are your kids too?? How is TA for tutoring the children and wanting them to do good in school??", "Well if the shoe fits...", "True but these kids are struggling in elementary school. If nothing is done to help them, college and trade school will be out of reach for them.", "Its basic crab mentality.", "The reason I ask about their age is in regard to them repeating a grade. Since they just entered this school having them repeat a grade would not be the worst idea. It appears this school is more academically challenging than their last school. How far are they behind their peers? Playing catch up is not an easy task. \n\nIt\u2019s totally relevant in this situation because OP & Mom are not on the same page with academics. If these kids don\u2019t want OP\u2019s help then they are wasting their time because Mom won\u2019t support any efforts. There\u2019s nothing in this post that shows how the kids feel about education.\n\nIt appears this is just a competition between two people/families about the importance of education.", "I grew up in a family where this is the expectation. They wear it as a badge of honor to keep working hard until their bodies literally just can\u2019t take it any more. So they would call working at 70 normal and possibly even celebrate it.", "She doesn't want it, the kids don't want it. Not his place to say, he can suggest only.\n\nHe and She should be on same page, they are not. His way isn't going to happen and only create conflict.", "To be honest, no kids want to do homework."]}
