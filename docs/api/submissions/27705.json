{"id": 27705, "submission_id": "16t6hca", "title": "AITA for refusing to take in my sister's kids after her partner had a stroke so that I can go on my planned vacation?", "selftext": "My sister (30F) called me (26F) yesterday morning to tell me that her partner (45M) had been rushed to the hospital. She was in hysterics and I stayed on the phone with her until she was able to make it to the hospital. She works and her partner stays home with the kids (I do believe he's on some sort of disability/unemployment benefit though). Together they have three kids who are 7, 5, and 2.\n\nHere's some background on me and my sister...we had actually not spoken for almost an entire year before her most recent call to me. We have a really strained relationship starting from our childhood, which was exacerbated by our parents. I'll be honest in saying that my parents always favored me and labeled my sister as a \"problem child.\" Since her teens, she's been involved with heavy drug use and partying. She graduated high school, but dropped out of community college. Our strict, traditional Asian parents shunned her from their lives after she dropped out of college. They effectively disowned her and pretend that they never had an older daughter. My parents haven't spoken a word to her in almost a decade and they have never met their grandchildren.\n\nFor the last decade, I've tried to maintain a positive relationship with my sister, but she's betrayed my trust too many times to count. Borrowing money and never returning it, stealing my items and pawning/selling them, bringing me into unnecessary drama in her life, etc. To be honest, I've been trying to distance myself from her for the last 3-4 years since she's caused me nothing but pain, stress, and suffering.\n\nThen last night, she called me again to let me know that her partner had suffered a severe stroke and had emergency surgery. The doctors say they are still very unsure of his prognosis. She then begged me to take in her children for the time being, saying how she can't afford any childcare and that she'll lose both her jobs if she's forced to stay with the children.\n\nNow here's the thing, me and my boyfriend's five-year anniversary is coming up. We've already bought tickets, requested PTO, and made accommodations for a two-week trip to Europe starting from this Friday. The total trip, including airfare, costed us $18,000, most of which is non-refundable.\n\nI told my sister I'd call her back and let her know after I spoke with my boyfriend. He said it was my choice completely. I decided that I wanted to go on our anniversary trip, which I had been looking forward to for a full year.\n\nI called my sister back and told her that I couldn't because of our trip. She started sobbing over the phone and lashed out at me, calling me cruel and selfish. She said that we could afford to just rebook our vacation and we didn't need that money back, but she was going to lose her job and her children if she couldn't find someone to take them in.\n\nIt was a really tough conversation, but I stuck with my decision. It's been almost a day since our call and I won't lie, I do feel a lot of guilt.

I said no to taking in my sister's three kids after her partner suffered a stroke. This was because I had a planned vacation to Europe with my boyfriend that I did not want to miss. \n\n2.

The answer is no. NTA\n\nWhile the emergency isn't your sister's fault, burning her bridge with you certainly was. She likely has other people who she could ask for help.\n\nAnd even if you wanted to assist, it would be more effective to pay for a babysitter than to waste the trip. It's not like being a blood relation changes anything since from what you're saying you'd be basically a stranger to the kids anyway. No different from just hiring an actual stranger.", "NTA- normally in this situation, you would be the bad guy. However, with her not talking to you for a year, plus all the past history of drugs, stealing, and drama, I understand the decision you made. She's trying to drop all the consequences of her poor life decisions in your lap, and it's just not fair. I understand the guilt, but she wore you out and used up whatever sisterly feeling you had for her with all her bullshit. Totally overused phrase, but particularly apt here: you can't set yourself on fire to keep other people warm.", "Is there anything you can help with aside from taking her kids? Like others say maybe you could give some assistance for emergency childcare or direct her to crisis support so she can get the care she needs for herself and her kids?\n\nNAH", "If you let those kids in your house, they may never leave. Maybe your sister loses her job and can\u2019t afford rent and asks to move in, too.

Her husband was on some sort of disability before he had the stroke, wouldn't they be eligible for some kind of assistance to help your sister out?", "I'm waffling on N A H, because sister has obviously hurt you to put you in this position.  Ultimately, NTA.\n\nShe can't burn her remaining bridges and expect people to leap over the waters for her.  It's, unfortunately, a product of her own (and your parent's) doing.\n\nDue to husband's medical status, could you perhaps assist her with finding social services to help her as a compromise?  I don't know if there are things like childcare assistance where you are.  Maybe finding her information while she focuses on her husband would help.\n\nA sad situation all around.", "NTA. Are you supposed to take care of these children indefinitely? I would go on the trip and I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty. You are not responsible for your sister\u2019s choices nor are you responsible for her children.", "If she can't afford childcare for a few weeks, how will she pay you back $18,000 plus compensate 2 weeks of pay to compensate for lost time off? Seems to me like childcare would be cheaper than that by a long shot.\n\nNTA... I think.", "Given your sister's history, do you know if her partner did, in fact, have a stroke? \n\nNTA, but how do you feel about her children? Will it worry you if there are repercussions for them (foster homes, homelessness, missing school, hunger)?\n\nI repeat, NTA. You have no obligation to your sister or her kids. That said, is there anything you can do or want to do to help?", "NTA, she went up shit creek without a paddle (granted, through no fault of her own, hubby's stroke) and then calls you after a year of not speaking because of stealing from you and expects you to drop everything to help her out? Yeah, that's not how that works. I suggest she asks her in-laws to help instead while you enjoy the life you planned in that year.\n\nEdited to correct the medical condition.", "Maybe you could help with childcare costs? NAH", "NTA holy shit that's a lot non refundable amount! And y'all have almost no relationship at all. Why should you drop your plans for someone who's not important to you?", ">stealing my items \n\nThis is plenty of cause to never have anything to do with her again.  NTA.", "NAH\n\nYournsister had a hard time growing up, yes partially to her own choices but if your parents are that strict and they even disowned her for dropping out of college. You sister has a history of being abused. It is no excuse for her behavior towards you with the lying and the cheating mind you. \nShe works 2 jobs to support her husband on disability and her 2 kids. Then the husband has a major Healthcare to the point where he might die. She could lose everything, her partner, her jobs and then her kids due to not having any money. I understand that she is desperate and I can't fault her for asking. She is in shock and grieving.\n\nI also understand you OP. Your sister hasn't been a good person in your life and you are hardly ever in contact. Besides 18.000 is a lot of money and I can imagine you don't have a money tree somewhere. That said, you're probably also not that close to your niblings. \n\nIs there anything else you can do? Help her call services (before your holiday) and see what can be set up with compensation and insurance so she can focus on her partner. \nIf you have the have the money  can you help pay for (licensed) childcare? Or see what the options are. Call the kids schools, maybe their teachers have ideas or resources for these situations.", "She hasn\u2019t been enough of a part in your life for you to give up that kind of money and consideration. NTA", "NTA. Go on your trip. If you\u2019re feeling guilty, you could help pay for childcare. If you loan the money, don\u2019t expect it back though.", "Possibly controversial but... NAH \n\nIt's unfortunate but her life is literally burning down around her. She hasn't maintained her support system and she is finding she doesn't have anywhere to turn. I've been there. I am NC with my family and Hubs doesn't have one. I have fallen flat on my ass because my life blew up and I didn't have anywhere to turn.", "NTA. I am pretty sure that NC is the next step. As they're not your kids, you have every right to reaffirm that it's not your responsibility. You're not selfless, you simply have had your own plans and they have conflicted in the way with their kids somehow. However, i can absolutely understand how you feel guilty considering that her husband has had a medical emergency.", "I'm going NTA\nYou're not close, she's burned you before, you had plans in place that would've cost you substantial money to cancel.\nI've spent countless amounts of time and money to help people that wouldn't bother to cross the street to piss on me if I was on fire. It took me years to realize that. Call me an asshole, fine. Don't rearrange your life for people that only call you when they're desperate. They won't be there for you if you're in dire need.", "She can take paid family leave or FMLA and won\u2019t lose her job.", "NTA. It sounds like boundaries are necessary in this relationship, and you have every right to keep those boundaries.", "Sister needs to file for fmla asap. Get husbands docs to sign off. Her jobs have to hold her spot (as long as she meets the requirements). \n\nI feel bad for her, but she burned a lot of bridges and now wants help.", "There is no \"past\" drug use if she's still actively doing all of those things. I'd bet money she is still actively using. I'd bet more money her partner is also using. Stop giving your sister any sort of cash asap.", "Your sister should have planned for this.  She reproduced with a much older guy with health problems.  Duh.", "You spent $18k of your money, you would be a fool to loose the money invested into a trip and not go.", "As someone who took on 3 of my sister's children, supposedly for a couple of weeks, don't do it! \nGo on your trip, if you help, keep everything at arm's length. Pay people directly if you chose to help with childcare. \nI had my own 2 children, then had her 3 as well for two years. It cost me thousands (I was supposedly doing it for the money -there was none but she told everyone there was) and I was accused of favouritism etc after she took them back.\nNever again", "NTA.  The hospital probably has a social worker for her to speak to.  It's just not your responsibility especially since she's NC for a year.  What happens if he ends up with terrible neuro damage and disabled or dies?  You'll have the kids and then be expected to be a full-time babysitter.  Don't do it.", "NTA. You need to live your life. That\u2019s a shit situation for her but what would she do if you had work too?", "NTA- But please but travel insurance. Your trip is costing $18,000.00 and you didn\u2019t insure that. For your own safety. Next time get travel insurance.", "That\u2019s a tough situation all the way around. I would say you\u2019re NTA but I can also understand why you feel guilty. Nobody wants to see their family in that type of situation. \n\nHave you tried calling the places you say are non refundable and see if they have some kind of medical emergency credit or rescheduling policy? \n\nI hope things improve for you and your sister.", "NTA- I understand why you feel guilty, but what are you supposed to do with 3 children (that likely barely know you) all of a sudden? Not even considering your trip, this arrangement seems indefinite. \n\nIf you can help financially, maybe you can help with daycare?\n\nShe needs to see if she can make some arrangements with her job.", "NTA. But can you pay for childcare for her?  Directly to the caregiver?  She is pitiful.", "Nta. She has made life choices. Now, those choices are conspiring against her. Enjoy your trip. Don't answer her calls or texts while gone. See what you can do to help after the trip.", "NTA.  You haven't spoken in over a year, and before that wasn't great either.", "NTA. It\u2019s really hard to set boundaries, especially with people who push them. You\u2019ve been looking forward to your trip for a year. She can ask her boyfriend\u2019s family to help out.", "NTA. It\u2019s really hard to set boundaries, especially with people who push them. You\u2019ve been looking forward to your trip for a year. She can ask her boyfriend\u2019s family to help out.", "NTA\n\nYou haven\u2019t spoken to her in a year. Would she have ever called if she didn\u2019t need help? You can only do so much for a person until you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t put your life on hold for her. Ask yourself this: if you needed help, would she help? Could you count on her?", "NTA but if she does lose her jobs expect more calls but looking for money this time.", "NTA. Your relationship with your sister has always been problematic. This is nothing new. Vacations are important for health. You have invested a good amount of money. Your decision also effects your bf. Your sister doesn\u2019t know what the ramifications of her situation will be. Perhaps it\u2019s time to go no contact. Don\u2019t let this ruin your vacation.", "Her poor planning is not your emergency. It\u2019s not always easy to rearrange plans, especially when others are involved and past experience shows her life is a circus. Do not let anyone guilt trip you into stretching yourself thin. Do what you can, when you can but know that sometimes you have to use tough love, or you will be left in a hole.", "NTA. And your parents should be the ones to keep the kids, not you.  I know you said they disowned her, but those are still their grandchildren.", "Under the circumstances, NTA.", "NTA", "What about your parents???? That\u2019s who can help her. She doesn\u2019t have any friends?", "NTA but if you can afford it, I would offer to help fund a sitter. Not all of it but some since she\u2019s broken your trust. It sucks because the kids are innocent but at the same time so are you in this situation due to her choices.", "Are you in the US? She can get FMLA for this to protect her job for a few months at least.", "NTA. It is too bad that her life decisions lead her to have to call a sibling after a year of silence. She has no one else nearby to take the kids. Who knows when she will take the children back. If ever. Those kids aren't your responsibility even if you were super close.", "NTA. You are not responsible. You don't even speak to her! In my eyes she is the one with the delusional gall to ask! She is the WHOLE A.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA. She should be protected under FMLA.", "NTA. Her history with you is enough to turn this down.", "NTA. Not your responsibility", "NTA but not because of the exact question you posed in the title. Your nta because this could potentially and very likely will be an altering event for her spouse and at the very least he isn\u2019t going to be able to watch the children while she works for some time. It doesn\u2019t sound like she has considered this and given some of the history you provided, I sort of feel like she will take advantage of you \u201cwatching\u201d the kids and it will be more like you \u201ctook the kids in\u201d. And she will come and go, showing up infrequently to get them and without notice to drop them off, all the while paying you nothing for child care costs, of course.", "NTA but also - your sister should talk to the hospital social worker. In some areas, there's something called a Crisis Nursery, which takes in kids (up to 18, usually) on a short term basis while their families are going through something where they're unable to be properly cared for. This seems like a good solution here.", "NTA. With the previous issues and non refundable trip, you have every right not to cancel. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty after everything she has done to you.  \n\nI would make sure your house is secure.  You need security cameras and someone actually watching your house.  You don\u2019t know what she may pull since she knows you won\u2019t be home.", "Your sister obviously has other relationships and attachments she has made in her life without you. It is time for her to call on those friendships now - not leave her kids with a stranger they hardly know. \n\nNTA", "Being a recovering addict and from a family of heavy drug use. I've seen some really awful shit. I've seen people make up the most heartbreaking stories, all for them to be false. I am 8 years sober. Got pregnant with my daughter almost two months after getting clean. \n\nMy mother would lie to me constantly. Saying she had cancer,  car needed fixing, the kids needed food and were starving. I got my siblings out of there. 2 are with me now and the youngest just went to college. Our mom died last year from sepsis. After her and step dad abandoned the entire family and lived on the streets for 4 years. \n\nYou should ask what hospital, call or go there to see if he is in fact there and his condition. For all you know is they are still using, haven't paid rent and are being evicted and she needs to pawn the kids off on you. Yes I've seen things like that happen, addicts will lie and say anything to pull your heartstrings to get what they want. It's worth checking. She could be telling the truth. But even if she is you aren't close to her and you don't even really know her kids. I'd help by maybe paying for a week or two of childcare, if I could. But her kids aren't your responsibility and with her history I would have some serious hesitation.", "You aren't under any obligation to take in her kids.

Your sister broke your trust too many times, so you really have no reason to believe her latest story. It\u2019s possible she wants to dump her kids on you fully so she can be free of responsibility. It\u2019s possible her husband didn\u2019t have a heart attack and she made it up to cause drama or guilt you into giving her free labor. \n\nGo no-contact. She\u2019s choosing, in adulthood, to be a user. You can choose to stop being used.", "I was going to say that you're TA, but $18,000 down the drain? Nope, never mind. NTA.", "NTA, but you could offer to help pay for childcare if you are able to do so. You don't owe it to her, but who knows where those children will end up.", "NTA but if you wanted to help her it would be cheaper for you to hire a babysitter for her or pay for daycare for however long your trip is. It\u2019s probably $3,000 for daycare for three children for one month.\n\nThough the 7 and 5 year old should be in school, so really just would need a Nanny or babysitter for evenings and the daycare for the youngest?", "Youre not obliged to take on other peoples kids. NTA.", "Are you kidding me She only called you bcz she immediately realized she has a childcare crisis.  NTA. Have a great anniversary trip. Hope you're going someplace extra special. Make your home really secure while you're gone in case of shenanigans.", "NTA. It\u2019s time to fully distance yourself, she\u2019s been using you, based on your description. Go on your trip and do not feel bad.", " NTA enjoy your holiday.\n\nDon\u2019t answer her calls while you are on it, or block her number and put an email redirect while you are away and filter her emails into a junk file.", "She can take fmla and be on short term disability if she has it.", "NTA. Ur sister is being so over dramatic. If she loses a few days of work, that will suck for the month. However, most places of work are pretty understanding when it comes to family emergencies.

And I feel bad for the kids that because their dad had a stroke they might go hungry. Maybe like help her pay for a sitter for a few weeks?", "Wow, most people really have absolutely no empathy on this sub. Answers like these are why this sub is so ridiculed elsewhere. \n\nCome on, the sister was abused by her parents growing up, then disowned for dropping out of college. Of course, that can very well lead to mental problems that can turn into drug use. But it sounds like she is pretty responsible now, working two jobs and taking care of three kids and a husband on disability. But sure, let's all just make all kinds of horrible assumptions about her, like she would abandon her children first chance she gets. And of course, it's all her own fault for not having a support system, WHEN HER PARENTS DISOWNED HER FOR A RIDICULOUS REASON?  Wow, just wow. She probably also caused her husband's stroke, inflation, and the war in Ukraine, now that we're at it, and she clearly deserves to suffer /s.\n\nThe number of people on here writing that she made her own shitty choices, and therefore, she deserves no sympathy in a situation she has absolutely no control over, is really horrifying. \n\nI am not saying OP is an asshole for not cancelling her trip, but neither is the sister for asking. And the right thing to do here is to offer sympathy and support to the extent that OP is capable of without comprising her own well-being, mental or otherwise.\n\nThe sister has previously done some bad things, sure. Sounds like it has been a direct result of the shitty parents' behaviour, and OP has probably gotten a lot more help from the parents to set up her life than the sister ever got, but of course the sister shouldn't have stolen from OP. She sucks for that, but that does not mean that she deserves to be in this horrible situation, and she has now only asked for help because it really is life or death. She is not begging for money to buy heroin. People on here must lead really hard lives to be this full of hatred and judgement.", "Go on your trip.\n\nYour sister is an adult and responsible for developing other options.", "You could maybe pay for 2 weeks of childcare. But I wouldn't want that money back. This is the most  human thing you could do for her and have some empathy, but also caring about the kids a bit. She needs you, but this is all you could do for her.", "NAH. You're obviously not an asshole to be cautious and not wasting 18k and PTO. But shes also not an asshole for coming to you for help. Yes its wromg she stole from you in the past but it sounds like your parents have failed her. It would be nice if you helped with daycare costs or paid for a babysitter tho.\n\nI am surprised your parents are cruel enough to abandon their grandchildren... Honestly the easiest option is your parents stop being petty and judgmental and put it aside for the wellbeing of their grandkids. Its either she leaves them alone or they go homeless... They actually hate her so much they feel no pity for their baby grandkids? Just because she went to a community college and partied??", "Keeping the kids out of foster care should be a priority. As many others have stated, you could pay a daycare provider directly to achieve that.\n\nHe'll be out of commission for months and if she doesn't work, they'll be homeless.

She was in hysterics and I stayed on the phone with her until she was able to make it to the hospital. She works and her partner stays home with the kids (I do believe he's on some sort of disability/unemployment benefit though). Together they have three kids who are 7, 5, and 2. \n\nHere's some background on me and my sister...we had actually not spoken for almost an entire year since her most recent call to me. We have a really strained relationship starting from our childhood, which was exacerbated by our parents. I'll be honest in saying that my parents always favored me and labeled my sister as a \"problem child.\" Since her teens, she's been involved with heavy drug use and partying. She graduated high school, but dropped out of community college. Our strict, traditional Asian parents shunned her from their lives after she dropped out of college. They effectively disowned her and pretend that they never had an older daughter. My parents haven't spoken a word to her in almost a decade and they have never met their grandchildren. \n\nFor the last decade, I've tried to maintain a positive relationship with my sister, but she's betrayed my trust too many times to count. Borrowing money and never returning it, stealing my items and pawning/selling them, bringing me into unnecessary drama in her life, etc. To be honest, I've been trying to distance myself from her for the last 3-4 years since she's caused me nothing but pain, stress, and suffering. \n\nThen last night, she called me again to let me know that her partner had suffered a severe stroke and had emergency surgery. The doctors say they are still very unsure of his prognosis. She then begged me to take in her children for the time being, saying how she can't afford any childcare and that she'll lose both her jobs if she's forced to stay with the children. \n\nNow here's the thing, me and my boyfriend's five-year anniversary is coming up. We've already bought tickets, requested PTO, and made accommodations for a two-week trip to Europe starting from this Friday. The total trip, including airfare, costed us $18,000, most of which is non-refundable. \n\nI told my sister I'd call her back and let her know after I spoke with my boyfriend. He said it was my choice completely. I decided that I wanted to go on our anniversary trip, which I had been looking forward to for a full year. \n\nI called my sister back and told her that I couldn't because of our trip. She started sobbing over the phone and lashed out at me, calling me cruel and selfish. She said that we could afford to just rebook our vacation and we didn't need that money back, but she was going to lose her job and her children if she couldn't find someone to take them in. \n\nIt was a really tough conversation, but I stuck with my decision. It's been almost a day since our call and I won't lie, I do feel a lot of guilt. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your sister is reaping the consequences of her past actions. Yes, it is sad that her kids are also suffering the brunt but that is karma to you. Why didn't she ask your parents?

Let them know how she reached out and it broke your heart to say no. Beg them to help on her behalf. Call them out if you have to and at least give them some brutal truths that you have been more than willing to be here.

She sent me pictures of him in the hospital and pictures of his CTs/MRIs. I do feel horrible for her, but at the same time, it's really tough for me to find the willpower to wire her money directly given that she's stolen thousands of dollars from me in the past. But again, we are definitely looking into finding a sitter and paying the sitter directly.\n\nTo end\u2014I will be going on the vacation. It's great to have the added support of my lovely boyfriend regarding my decision. I'm hoping he never sees this post since he doesn't use reddit, but another big reason I wanted to go on this trip is because I have a sneaking suspicion that he might propose. :,)", "Offering to pay to cover a sitter was my thought too. It sounds like OP would have the money and would solve the problem. Most likely the sister would be able to get help if she was able to pay decently. \n\nPossibly just throwing the money away, if the hesitation on this involves taking money previously to be used on drugs, I understand OP. Doesn't make you the bad person here. But it is a solution that gets you your vacation and helps her care for her partner and children.", "If OP can manage it, offering to pay for a babysitter is the right call here, I think.", "This is when she has to find out about community resources. What she's asking is too much. If you were close emotionally or physically to the kids, it might be different but she has no long-term plan except for you. She needs to talk to social services and the hospital to find out what resources are available to her. NTA", ">No different from just hiring an actual stranger.\n\nThis is kind of a crazy thing to say. From the perspective of the adults, hiring a total stranger and having them in your home and around your children, alone, is a *hugely* different scenario from hiring family.", "She sounds like the kind of person that pops out of nowhere whenever she needs something and then disappears after she gets it.", "I had to watch my best friend and her children lose 2 dads. I was friends with their bio-dad, and did whatever I could for her when he died. Later, she married my brother, who was my best friend, and sh3 became my SIL. My brother adopted the kids as his own. Then we lost him too. Now she and I are co-moms. I love them more than anything. I would do literally anything for them. \n\nI also have a terrible, entitled, racist, nasty sister. We never got along, and we have very little contact. If she called me out of no where with her husband dying, I could feel empathy for her, but she wouldn't appreciate it. I also would not cancel my trip\nIf no one else could take in her 4 kids for awhile, I'd offer to pitch in for a sitter, if I could. \n\nIt's okay to have empathy. Empathy should never be used as a weapon against you. Your sister is upset, and that is expected. But she is guilt tripping you into being her free baby sitter. Your SO is willing to cancel the trip if you want to. That is a person who loves you and appreciates your empathy. He is your priority. Guilt should never be the only connection you have with someone else, even family.", "I gotta say this is one of the ones I\u2019m the MOST conflicted in. There is NO good answer. \n\nIt\u2019s times like these families really NEED to step up for each other but also her sister sounds like a shit sister and if OP is anything like me 18k is a once in a decade or two possibility for a trip so to waste it is unimaginable.", "I disagree. It\u2019s her choice, she wouldn\u2019t be an AH either way.", "Why doesn\u2019t she have any support friends or other family during a time of crisis? Because she\u2019s incapable of creating a supportive environment by helping others. 18k plans you can\u2019t walk away from, you\u2019ve created your own healthy relationship. If she has no one else it\u2019s not your doing or your burden.", "I don\u2019t know that this situation is a \u201cnormally she would be the bad guy\u201d. for me if I have a 18k trip I would not have stayed even if I did talk to my sister often. She should book other childcare, contact other family members, maybe OP could have helped with paying for that. I am not saying Op shouldn\u2019t/couldnt help but I don\u2019t really see many scenarios where OP is TA here.", "There wouldn\u2019t be a situation where refusing to take the kids would be wrong.", "Normally, this would make you an AH. Given however, the burned bridges, the terrible behavior, and the poor life decisions, the most I\u2019d probably offer is pitching in for childcare. \n\nAnything else would set a potentially dangerous precedent, honestly the pitching in already sets a precedent. \n\nNTA", "But in this specific situation, the sister isn't trying to drop everything on OPs lap. This is an emergency and a tragedy. I think it's NAH", "Lol I guess you can consider her choice of husband a bad life choice. And I'm not sure how his health was before given that he was on disability but no one really chooses for their husband to have a stroke. That was just an unfortunate dice roll. Regardless of anyone's past deeds, it shouldn't mean they somehow deserve such a cosmic kick in the balls and the added heart-wrenching pain of being absolutely alone. No one deserves that. But yes I definitely agree with that last idiom. I just imagine no matter what decision the consequences weigh heavy.", "I\u2019ve never heard that phrase.", "At least op knows after this she will never have a relationship with her sister ever again", "NTA. \n\nIf you were feeling generous you could pay for an agency nanny for a couple of weeks while she sorts something out, then remove yourself from the situation.", "NAH. \n\nHear me out. No OP is not an AH. Clearly. \n\nBut everyone is taking into account the sister\u2019s past history as an addict, thief, drama mama. Fine.\n\nBut then if you take into account her *recent* history, then also take into account *the entire* back story. \n\nSis was disowned, parents made her the scapegoat, Op was golden child, sis was essentially emotionally abused and thrown away. \n\nIt\u2019s not like her drug use and downward spiral came out of nowhere. \n\nSo if her unreliable BS and drama are relevant to the judgement, then so should her backstory be relevant. \n\nOP is not an AH but there\u2019s a good reason she feels guilty and hopefully those kids don\u2019t go into the system. That would be tragic. \n\nThe parents are the true villains here.", "So you mean, normally op would be the bad guy for not wanting to throw 18.000$ into the lake?", "Agreed. Regardless of past history, of course sister would ask in this situation. OP also has a right to say no. That being said...things will be infinitely worse if sister loses both her jobs. I'd probably want to do something to make sure that doesn't happen. I mean, there's the wellbeing of three kids to consider , as well.", "That also feels like adulting by proxy. Sometimes there are just consequences. People who create crisis\u2019 won\u2019t stop.", "Yup. NAH. I can't understand these people who say that encourages OP to just abandon two children just because of the fault of their mother. \n\nThere should be something else that can be done to help them. If OP is not willing to give money for a babysitter for a while, then the sister should be open to the idea of having help from their mother. \n\nJust helping the sister until she gets aid from the government or any other entity will be a big help. As someone else said in this thread, the sister losing her jobs and children is infinitely worse and might put the sister in a place where she can never get back up from. \n\nMost of us advocate to be good to the homeless but when one is right in front of you at the verge of being that, you'd rather ignore? Do it for the kids, at least.\n\nFinally, it's unfair that this responsibility falls on OP's lap. That's true. But life isn't always fair, and people should just really strive to be a good person despite off that.", "Yeah, I honestly really worry about that too. Plus, me and my boyfriend live in an apartment in the city and we're about a four-hour drive from her place. Not even sure how I would begin to take care of a 5-year-old and a 2-year-old. I've also never even met her youngest children, only the oldest maybe 1-2 times so I'm not close with them at all.", "This is an excellent point. The brother in law may take months to recover and she will expect you to drop everything and watch the kids during that time.", "Yeah, his disability isn\u2019t going to be taken away while he\u2019s in the hospital in rehab. Assuming he makes it. And the children will get death benefits from Social Security if he doesn\u2019t. In the meantime, the sister may also qualify for other welfare style benefits, like food stamps, and possibly rental assistance and childcare vouchers", "If he needs a caretaker she could see if the state would pay her to be his. Im not positive if they do temporary or not.", "Based on the sister's answer (\"you can afford it\") I don't think she ever was planning on paying OP back.", "This. Heavily questioning the stroke, and completely positive there's still a drug use problem.", "Or she can go to work and take the 2 kids to school and the 1 daycare if she's so worried about losing her job, while visiting the hubby in the evenings.", "Ask her to arrange for a childcare and make payments directly to the provider.\nThis is a tough situation but NAH is the best response here.", "Why? The way I see it, all the shit she stole from OP and sold IS his contribution to childcare costs.", "When she already owes OP money, not to mention the stealing? Absolutely not.", "This is the way.", "NAH. I feel the same way. While IP\u2019s sister has not done anything to desserve her help- she\u2019s in a very sad situation. I also can\u2019t fault OP for not wanting to put her own life on hold. \n\nAs others have suggested, perhaps getting her in touch with a family crisis organization would CNN e a step in the right direction.", "Yep, whatever issues I may have with my sister, it\u2019s my sister. I have a similar issue where she has been deemed a bit of a disappointment by my father (our mom passed away), and she can be distant or cut us off temporarily. But, we love each other and whatever way I could, I\u2019d help. \n\nHere, I agree that it could get complicated in terms of how long the help goes on. \n\nBut at least with helping her seek help while she\u2019s in this time of grief, that can be done. And setting a temporary babysitting fund paid to the sitter while the sister arranges a more permanent solution.", "If OP were to pay for child care, they need to set a time limit or monetary limit in advance for how long they will cover the cost, that way sister can't say the rug is being pulled out from under her if OP hits their limit and needs/wants to stop paying.", "Not OP\u2019s responsibility.

Only directly to licensed caregiver.", "Happy Cake Day\ud83c\udf70", "See, I don't really think the children will get taken away. Depending on where they live, she may be able to get a family emergency leave of absence. Yeah, she may not get paid, but idk why the kids would be taken away unless there are some other serious issues we have not been told.", "No, there is absolutely nothing for her to feel guilt. They are not close. If they had been more in each other's life, then that might be different, but they weren't. It's not her fault for what happens with the children. The moment the first one was born, the sister should have made emergency plans. Hell, hubby and I do that for our pets...surely children deserve the same.", "She's entitled??? It is a medical emergency", "I agree with you & am amazed at everyone justifying OP.  If this had been sister posting, everyone would call OP the AH.  This is along the lines I was thinking.  \n1.  I have had little to no relationship with my sister for 15 years, but I would not be able to abandon her (or her kids) in a similar situation\u2026.and she lives 2000 miles from me.\n2.  Why would you plan a big trip without travel insurance?  What if it was one of your parents who had the stroke?  My husband and I travel frequently & always purchase it\u2026and have used it.\n3.  The sister is not asking her to help so that she can sit by husbands bed\u2026she needs to have childcare to WORK.  Disability for husband is not going to keep a roof over their heads.

However, everyone overlooks the fact that there is a daycare crisis in this country.  It would take a miracle to find instant daycare for one kid, let alone 3.  Plus, she works 2 jobs\u2026probably 12 hours a day, try finding daycare for that.\n5.  The kids!  Their father, who is their primary caregiver, is in the hospital.

People are absolutely more comfortable with family watching their children as opposed to a stranger.", "That's what I was thinking. She sounds like the kind of person that would leave the kids with OP indefinitely and not cover their expenses.", "Do you mean runs off somewhere that is not at the hospital with her husband? Or do you mean runs off to the hospital and doesn\u2019t come back for days?", "What makes you say that?", "Got a feeling ain't nothing wrong with the husband tho", "This was my first thought as well,  she would drop off the kids, then ghost them.", "That\u2019s ridiculous. Sometimes you guys go way overboard with your comments. Just because she used to be addicted to drugs doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s true in any way. And OP admitted their parents always favored her over her sister as the \u201cperfect\n\u201c child\u2026 it\u2019s no wonder she got into drugs. And OP decides to distance herself AFTER her sister gets clean and starts a family? Whatever. It\u2019s an excuse to not feel guilty and get everyone on her side. Which, whatever. I don\u2019t care that she doesn\u2019t want to not go on her expensive vacation to help her sister but I do care that people are making wild accusations based on that. \n\nDo you feel better, OP? Having a bunch of strangers trash your sister to make you feel less guilty\u2026. Just own it. You don\u2019t want to miss your lavish vacation. Period. I would have more respect for you if you admitted it without the rest of the excuses.", "If she's such a shitty person and can't deal with them she could just leave them with the husband, or give them up to CPS herself, no need for the shenanigans here. But it's easy to check if someone is in hospital or not.", "It would be even more as OP works so would have to find and pay for childcare which is usually both stressful and expensive", "First thing that crossed my mind.", "I was also wondering if sister knew about the vacation and is trying to scam her to cancel for a break from the kids.", "Not hard to call hospital and ask for condition of whatever his name is saying you're family or asking if you can contact sister who should be at said hospital.", "Bro, 18k? \n\nI'd rather take out a loan for a few thousand to pay for emergency childcare for a few weeks than eat 18k and miss a trip to Europe. My ass is *gone.*\n\nNo way, no how, I am losing 18k. I'd rather pay for childcare with someone else. Peace.", "But is she even capable of caring for the kids? She\u2019s childfree, full-time job, I seriously doubt her home is kid-friendly. And how much time off work is she supposed to take to stay home with the kids? Plus she lives 4 hours away from where the kids go to school. \n\nThis simply isn\u2019t a rational solution at all. The most OP could really do is help arrange and pay for childcare in the sister\u2019s town (again, FOUR HOURS AWAY). The oldest kids still have to go to school and the youngest needs all-day care, indefinitely. They need a real plan, not a panicked stupid scheme that makes zero sense.", "I wouldn't think twice to step up it not for the trip. In fact, I've done it several times, no questions asked. I've even canceled a vacation when my FIL had a heart attack. But eating $18K for a sister who steals from me is a whole other ballgame.", "Refusing to take the kids is always a perfectly acceptable response.", "I like it. Lol at my downvotes for admitting I\u2019ve never heard something. \n\nI\u2019ll take them. There\u2019s no shame in learning something new and publicly acknowledging it was something you\u2019d never heard before.", "I get all that. \nSo does the person who\u2019s had things stolen from her and has been LC NC set aside 18k plans because her sister has no coping mechanisms or ancillary support? \nI don\u2019t think so. Will OP have guilt? Hopefully not so much that she\u2019d set her own needs and life aside.", "Pay for the childcare directly........who knows what the sister would do with the money if given it directly", "Don\u2019t send her money directly.", "Hundred thousand of perfectly happy kids are daily handed over to the strangers (babysitters, nannies, daycare providers, kindergarten teachers, school teachers). You know, people have to work, not everybody can afford the luxury of staying home with their children until they are teenagers.", "You are having a big lapse of basic common sense. \n\nFirst of all- private childcare exists. When people hire Nannies, which they do\u2026 all the time, that\u2019s basically handing kids over to a stranger. \n\nAs for an \u201cundetermined amount of time\u201d yeah, no. How about \u201cuntil OP gets home from work\u201d.", "Yeah no what? Explain?", "Many qualified child care providers undergo extensive testing and searches to ensure they are safe to leave your kids with, family members, however, do not.\nMost cases of child abuse are at the hands of relatives, not trained childcare specialists", "Why? She specifically does not want a relationship with the sister.", "Yes, but nothing indicates the sister even tried to find an alternative before demanding OP provide the solution.", "Yes a timeline is also a great option in this case.", "That's the best solution in my view: pay for child care, but make it clear that it's for a limited period only, 2-3 weeks max. This should give her enough time to care for her partner and arrange ongoing support if he needs longer rehabilitation. Don't let her get comfy on gifted money.", "Oh my god they got the gender wrong who cares", "People in desperate situations.  I'm not saying OP should do it, and the fact she seemingly doesn't have anyone else to turn to is almost certainly her own fault, I'm just saying this could just as easily be absolute desperation rather than entitlement.", "You literally implied that my boyfriend should leave me to find someone \"with the same commitment to/empathy for family and children who are being tossed like baggage\". How is that not rude?", ">You say your sister steals...I am not understanding why you don't just give her money so she doesn't need to.\n\nbecause she steals from ME. lmao", "Yuck! Im sorry you have such and entitled and ungrateful sister. My guess is, she wants what she wants and no explanation could ever change her mind. Because you watched one nibling, you are in the list of people she can harass for babysitting. Your circumstances and which child you watched are irrelevant.\n\nI have a nibling who was asking everyone in the family, everyone she was tangentially related to, and family friends for money (because she wanted money). Her criteria was \u201cI\u2019ve met them, so I can ask them\u201d.", "That jumped out at me too. She wasn't asking for childcare, she was asking OP to take the kids.", "Runs off and never comes back until she needs something else. She might go to the hospital first but I have seen the good and bad with stroke recovery and OP says \"BIL\" might already have medical issues which leads me to believe there is a chance he won't recover from this enough to look after their kids which will essentially leave everyone in the current situation permanently", "Spoken like someone who\u2019s never had a night of babysitting turn into a week/month before. I\u2019d never say that\u2019s definitely happening here, I don\u2019t know these people, but\u2026 it does happen, unfortunately. And it\u2019s almost always an addict who \u201closes track of time\u201d.", "The sister hasn't  reached to repair any of the many bridges she burned,so I doubt she has changed much.", "I agree that those comments are a little over the top. However, it doesn't change the situation where OP is four hours away from the sister. This means the kids would need to change schools if the care become long term. It also means either OP or her husband would need to be a stay at home parent for the younger kids. Four hours away also mean it is an 8 hours roundtrip to allow the sister to visit her kids, which means if this become long term, the sister will be barely be able to see her kids. That would not be great to the kids who would feel abandoned by both mom and dad. \n\nPractically, OP and her husband are not the right people to take on the kids. Sister should look for someone local to her who can take that on.", "[removed]", "It is hard to do that nowadays. Medical information shouldn\u2019t be given out to others.", "I think this response makes sense, assist with childcare.", "You definitely need more upvotes, why doesn't OP's sister have some sort of alternative childcare that doesn't involve calling her sister who lives 4 hours away who she hasn't spoken to in a YEAR??", "Considering OP is four hour drive away from her sister, even without a pending trip, it is a huge ask. Four hours away means the older kids would need to change schools, and the younger kids would need either OP or her husband to be a SAHP. It also means OP and her husband will be effectively raising the kids as either side making 8 hour round trips for the sister to see the kids is impractical at the very least.", "Thank you!", "Where did I say to give up any of the holiday? You can give advice and direction and not suddenly lose a holiday.", "This is the best solution.", "I agree", "Most of the professions you\u2019ve listed need some kind of training to be able to work with children. OP states she has no clue how to look after the little ones. \n\nThose professions are also paid to do that and give the kids back at the end of the day. OPs sister has proven she can\u2019t be trusted and has burnt bridges - it\u2019s not really just about a working parent in an emergency.", "Yes, but to be fair, these children are being dropped off for overnight stay for an indeterminate amount of time, during a very stressful situation. It's not calling a babysitter to come over for a few hours. I don't have kids, but I'm pretty sure that's a very different scenario.", "Daycare while one goes to work during the day is different than taking them continuously for a week or two.", "It's an Australian way of saying no. Yeah I hear what your saying, but no.", "The entitlement came in when she called OP names for refusing.", "Ok, I see what you are trying to say. Still, the sister has repeatedly slapped the OP in the face. I wouldn't even know where I would dig to find the audacity to ask this of someone I had borrowed money I never intended to pay back and stolen from, much less to call them selfish for not wanting to lose $18,000 to help me out. I would ask literally anyone else, but I guess I have integrity and would never steal anything or borrow without paying it back in the first place.\n\nEdited for clarity", "Hmm. You asked if you were an AH.\n\nYou were answered.", "You can't steal what's given freely ...", "Gotcha, I read some other comments after I asked that had the same idea and elaborated a bit so I figured this would be it.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong about stroke recovery. My partner had a series of small-ish strokes about 10 years ago, it was the scariest time in my life.", "Bot", "I understand it.   \nI just mean that \"handing kids to the strangers\" is very common and normal practice. Trained and ressourceful, but still strangers.", "Americans do this too", "I didn't ask for your judgement on my relationship with my boyfriend, which is what you so condescendingly provided. :)", "The worst I have seen was my grandfather, he had a stroke but insisted on remaining independent two weeks after he demanded to go back home (he had been staying with family) my uncle went to do his daily check in and found him passed out in the backyard (middle of summer in QLD Australia). He had no memory of how he got there or why he was in the backyard. He wasn't allowed to live alone after that, no one would hear his arguments and this was after his first stroke.\n\nHad a family friend recover better and have had to bury another family friend but that wasn't just a stroke.", "Yep, with someone this selfish the urge to drop everything and start over somewhere else without these \"burdens\" could be pretty tempting.", "When you ask if YATA you are asking for judgment.\n\nThis is Reddit.", "I\u2019m so sorry. That incident with your grandfather must have been so scary! Older people can be so stubborn it defies all reasoning sometimes. And I\u2019m so sorry you lost a friend, and very happy you got to keep another. \n\nAbout a decade ago, partner went for a standard eye exam to get a new prescription one early afternoon. Everything was going well, no issues. Then the optician used some kind of machine that lets you look into the eye, and apparently also part of the brain, where he discovered a clot. Partner was immediately rushed to hospital. He phoned me from there as I was home. He had already had several strokes, but they were basically asymptomatic. \n\nOver the next six months, he had several more, many of which were not asymptomatic. It affected his speech. Sometimes he couldn\u2019t speak at all, other times he would slur his words, and sometimes he would use words, but in a way that made no sense. \u201cWhat would you like for dinner\u201d became \u201chow ladle prince broom juggler\u201d. \n\nA couple of times he woke up and didn\u2019t know who I was, because in his mind he was 20 years old again, and he didn\u2019t meet me until he was 28.\n\nThankfully, he made a full recovery, at least as far as I or anyone else can tell, though he swears he lost a few IQ points. If he did, he\u2019s the only one who perceives it.\n\nHe still has the clot that was discovered at the optician\u2019s that day. It was so \u201cstuck\u201d (pardon that excessive medical jargon :p) that the doctors said it would be riskier trying to dislodge it, and new blood vessels had formed around it so its removal wasn\u2019t strictly necessary anymore. Though he was advised to give up roller coasters and head banging. \n\nIt was 11 years ago that the blood clot was first discovered. Go to your eye tests, people! Who knew those things can save lives?", "Nah BS. You created a strawman and now you're doubling down.\n\nYou want to welcome kinds into your home you have never met for a family member who stole from you and hasn't spoken to you in a year? Then you're an idiot, not a saint.", "The friend who recovered better was having on the phone when it happened. My best friend was 16 and only had her learners permit, drove her mum and younger siblings to the drs and the drs called the ambulance, friend just panicked but knew she needed medical help. When they eventually got back home my friend realises she had forgotten to turn the stove off before leaving the house and the eggs she had been cooking for lunch had exploded and she had to scape them off the roof. \n\nHer mum has had a few more in the last decade and a half and now can't remember much.", "That is terrifying. I sometimes have similar symptoms from migraines and it always worries me that I'd not be able to identify a stroke. I haven't had half my face drop, though I know people with migraines that cause that too, but I lose the ability to speak until I take my meds & they kick in or I can't stand up etc. I often end up losing words or use a word that is totally wrong.\nI've had a bunch of head scans over the years for one reason or another so I assume they'd have even able to tell if I had been having strokes.\nI assume it's just migraines and brain fog from low blood pressure, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and a bunch of other health problems. I have definitely lost IQ points after decades of daily migraines, low blood pressure & brain fog. I can barely carry on a conversation these days. If itvs not the aphasia itvs just losing track of what I was saying or struggling to concentrate on reading. It sucks. I have finally got on a preventative migraine medication that means the actual migraines are now more like 4 or 5 a month rather than pretty much every day though so that's amazing progress after nearly 30 years. \n\nMy friend who also has migraines and EDS went to the hospital because of such horrific head pain and they did some tests and sent her home. She didn't get better so she went to a different hospital and they said shevd been having mini strokes, had had about 15 of them and had been having them at the time she was in the other hospital. That's my local hospital so that gives me a lot of confidence too.\n\nThankfully she's mostly recovered. Terrifying though.", "I did not say I would. \n\nI would definitely not leave, though, if I could help in crisis. Find a shelter, get her committed, etc.\n And, I know from IRL experience (similar but not circumstances) that most EU hotels/car rd talks/even some EU air carriers will hold pre-paid and deposits for a year. I faced a slightly higher bill 4 years ago. The delayed trip was incredible, and a troubled person and offspring received help. I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s a win-win.", "Goodness gracious, your poor friend. 16?! I didn\u2019t know how to handle my partner\u2019s already diagnosed strokes, and I was 23! How incredibly scary!", "Unfortunately these are the consequences OP\u2019s sister gets to face for burning bridges by repeatedly breaking her trust."]}
