{"id": 27705, "submission_id": "16t6hca", "title": "AITA for refusing to take in my sister's kids after her partner had a stroke so that I can go on my planned vacation?", "selftext": "My sister (30F) called me (26F) yesterday morning to tell me that her partner (45M) had been rushed to the hospital. She was in hysterics and I stayed on the phone with her until she was able to make it to the hospital. She works and her partner stays home with the kids (I do believe he's on some sort of disability/unemployment benefit though). Together they have three kids who are 7, 5, and 2.\n\nHere's some background on me and my sister...we had actually not spoken for almost an entire year before her most recent call to me. We have a really strained relationship starting from our childhood, which was exacerbated by our parents. I'll be honest in saying that my parents always favored me and labeled my sister as a \"problem child.\" Since her teens, she's been involved with heavy drug use and partying. She graduated high school, but dropped out of community college. Our strict, traditional Asian parents shunned her from their lives after she dropped out of college. They effectively disowned her and pretend that they never had an older daughter. My parents haven't spoken a word to her in almost a decade and they have never met their grandchildren.\n\nFor the last decade, I've tried to maintain a positive relationship with my sister, but she's betrayed my trust too many times to count. Borrowing money and never returning it, stealing my items and pawning/selling them, bringing me into unnecessary drama in her life, etc. To be honest, I've been trying to distance myself from her for the last 3-4 years since she's caused me nothing but pain, stress, and suffering.\n\nThen last night, she called me again to let me know that her partner had suffered a severe stroke and had emergency surgery. The doctors say they are still very unsure of his prognosis. She then begged me to take in her children for the time being, saying how she can't afford any childcare and that she'll lose both her jobs if she's forced to stay with the children.\n\nNow here's the thing, me and my boyfriend's five-year anniversary is coming up. We've already bought tickets, requested PTO, and made accommodations for a two-week trip to Europe starting from this Friday. The total trip, including airfare, costed us $18,000, most of which is non-refundable.\n\nI told my sister I'd call her back and let her know after I spoke with my boyfriend. He said it was my choice completely. I decided that I wanted to go on our anniversary trip, which I had been looking forward to for a full year.\n\nI called my sister back and told her that I couldn't because of our trip. She started sobbing over the phone and lashed out at me, calling me cruel and selfish. She said that we could afford to just rebook our vacation and we didn't need that money back, but she was going to lose her job and her children if she couldn't find someone to take them in.\n\nIt was a really tough conversation, but I stuck with my decision. It's been almost a day since our call and I won't lie, I do feel a lot of guilt.

I said no to taking in my sister's three kids after her partner suffered a stroke. This was because I had a planned vacation to Europe with my boyfriend that I did not want to miss. \n\n2.

The answer is no. NTA\n\nWhile the emergency isn't your sister's fault, burning her bridge with you certainly was. She likely has other people who she could ask for help.\n\nAnd even if you wanted to assist, it would be more effective to pay for a babysitter than to waste the trip. It's not like being a blood relation changes anything since from what you're saying you'd be basically a stranger to the kids anyway. No different from just hiring an actual stranger.", "NTA- normally in this situation, you would be the bad guy. However, with her not talking to you for a year, plus all the past history of drugs, stealing, and drama, I understand the decision you made. She's trying to drop all the consequences of her poor life decisions in your lap, and it's just not fair. I understand the guilt, but she wore you out and used up whatever sisterly feeling you had for her with all her bullshit. Totally overused phrase, but particularly apt here: you can't set yourself on fire to keep other people warm.", "Is there anything you can help with aside from taking her kids? Like others say maybe you could give some assistance for emergency childcare or direct her to crisis support so she can get the care she needs for herself and her kids?\n\nNAH", "If you let those kids in your house, they may never leave. Maybe your sister loses her job and can\u2019t afford rent and asks to move in, too.

Her husband was on some sort of disability before he had the stroke, wouldn't they be eligible for some kind of assistance to help your sister out?", "I'm waffling on N A H, because sister has obviously hurt you to put you in this position.  Ultimately, NTA.\n\nShe can't burn her remaining bridges and expect people to leap over the waters for her.  It's, unfortunately, a product of her own (and your parent's) doing.\n\nDue to husband's medical status, could you perhaps assist her with finding social services to help her as a compromise?  I don't know if there are things like childcare assistance where you are.  Maybe finding her information while she focuses on her husband would help.\n\nA sad situation all around.", "NTA. Are you supposed to take care of these children indefinitely? I would go on the trip and I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty. You are not responsible for your sister\u2019s choices nor are you responsible for her children.", "If she can't afford childcare for a few weeks, how will she pay you back $18,000 plus compensate 2 weeks of pay to compensate for lost time off? Seems to me like childcare would be cheaper than that by a long shot.\n\nNTA... I think.", "Given your sister's history, do you know if her partner did, in fact, have a stroke? \n\nNTA, but how do you feel about her children? Will it worry you if there are repercussions for them (foster homes, homelessness, missing school, hunger)?\n\nI repeat, NTA. You have no obligation to your sister or her kids. That said, is there anything you can do or want to do to help?", "NTA, she went up shit creek without a paddle (granted, through no fault of her own, hubby's stroke) and then calls you after a year of not speaking because of stealing from you and expects you to drop everything to help her out? Yeah, that's not how that works. I suggest she asks her in-laws to help instead while you enjoy the life you planned in that year.\n\nEdited to correct the medical condition.", "Maybe you could help with childcare costs? NAH", "NTA holy shit that's a lot non refundable amount! And y'all have almost no relationship at all. Why should you drop your plans for someone who's not important to you?", ">stealing my items \n\nThis is plenty of cause to never have anything to do with her again.  NTA.", "NAH\n\nYournsister had a hard time growing up, yes partially to her own choices but if your parents are that strict and they even disowned her for dropping out of college. You sister has a history of being abused. It is no excuse for her behavior towards you with the lying and the cheating mind you. \nShe works 2 jobs to support her husband on disability and her 2 kids. Then the husband has a major Healthcare to the point where he might die. She could lose everything, her partner, her jobs and then her kids due to not having any money. I understand that she is desperate and I can't fault her for asking. She is in shock and grieving.\n\nI also understand you OP. Your sister hasn't been a good person in your life and you are hardly ever in contact. Besides 18.000 is a lot of money and I can imagine you don't have a money tree somewhere. That said, you're probably also not that close to your niblings. \n\nIs there anything else you can do? Help her call services (before your holiday) and see what can be set up with compensation and insurance so she can focus on her partner. \nIf you have the have the money  can you help pay for (licensed) childcare? Or see what the options are. Call the kids schools, maybe their teachers have ideas or resources for these situations.", "She hasn\u2019t been enough of a part in your life for you to give up that kind of money and consideration. NTA", "NTA. Go on your trip. If you\u2019re feeling guilty, you could help pay for childcare. If you loan the money, don\u2019t expect it back though.", "Possibly controversial but... NAH \n\nIt's unfortunate but her life is literally burning down around her. She hasn't maintained her support system and she is finding she doesn't have anywhere to turn. I've been there. I am NC with my family and Hubs doesn't have one. I have fallen flat on my ass because my life blew up and I didn't have anywhere to turn.", "NTA. I am pretty sure that NC is the next step. As they're not your kids, you have every right to reaffirm that it's not your responsibility. You're not selfless, you simply have had your own plans and they have conflicted in the way with their kids somehow. However, i can absolutely understand how you feel guilty considering that her husband has had a medical emergency.", "I'm going NTA\nYou're not close, she's burned you before, you had plans in place that would've cost you substantial money to cancel.\nI've spent countless amounts of time and money to help people that wouldn't bother to cross the street to piss on me if I was on fire. It took me years to realize that. Call me an asshole, fine. Don't rearrange your life for people that only call you when they're desperate. They won't be there for you if you're in dire need.", "She can take paid family leave or FMLA and won\u2019t lose her job.", "NTA. It sounds like boundaries are necessary in this relationship, and you have every right to keep those boundaries.", "Sister needs to file for fmla asap. Get husbands docs to sign off. Her jobs have to hold her spot (as long as she meets the requirements). \n\nI feel bad for her, but she burned a lot of bridges and now wants help.", "There is no \"past\" drug use if she's still actively doing all of those things. I'd bet money she is still actively using. I'd bet more money her partner is also using. Stop giving your sister any sort of cash asap.", "Your sister should have planned for this.  She reproduced with a much older guy with health problems.  Duh.", "You spent $18k of your money, you would be a fool to loose the money invested into a trip and not go.", "As someone who took on 3 of my sister's children, supposedly for a couple of weeks, don't do it! \nGo on your trip, if you help, keep everything at arm's length. Pay people directly if you chose to help with childcare. \nI had my own 2 children, then had her 3 as well for two years. It cost me thousands (I was supposedly doing it for the money -there was none but she told everyone there was) and I was accused of favouritism etc after she took them back.\nNever again", "NTA.  The hospital probably has a social worker for her to speak to.  It's just not your responsibility especially since she's NC for a year.  What happens if he ends up with terrible neuro damage and disabled or dies?  You'll have the kids and then be expected to be a full-time babysitter.  Don't do it.", "NTA. You need to live your life. That\u2019s a shit situation for her but what would she do if you had work too?", "NTA- But please but travel insurance. Your trip is costing $18,000.00 and you didn\u2019t insure that. For your own safety. Next time get travel insurance.", "That\u2019s a tough situation all the way around. I would say you\u2019re NTA but I can also understand why you feel guilty. Nobody wants to see their family in that type of situation. \n\nHave you tried calling the places you say are non refundable and see if they have some kind of medical emergency credit or rescheduling policy? \n\nI hope things improve for you and your sister.", "NTA- I understand why you feel guilty, but what are you supposed to do with 3 children (that likely barely know you) all of a sudden? Not even considering your trip, this arrangement seems indefinite. \n\nIf you can help financially, maybe you can help with daycare?\n\nShe needs to see if she can make some arrangements with her job.", "NTA. But can you pay for childcare for her?  Directly to the caregiver?  She is pitiful.", "Nta. She has made life choices. Now, those choices are conspiring against her. Enjoy your trip. Don't answer her calls or texts while gone. See what you can do to help after the trip.", "NTA.  You haven't spoken in over a year, and before that wasn't great either.", "NTA. It\u2019s really hard to set boundaries, especially with people who push them. You\u2019ve been looking forward to your trip for a year. She can ask her boyfriend\u2019s family to help out.", "NTA. It\u2019s really hard to set boundaries, especially with people who push them. You\u2019ve been looking forward to your trip for a year. She can ask her boyfriend\u2019s family to help out.", "NTA\n\nYou haven\u2019t spoken to her in a year. Would she have ever called if she didn\u2019t need help? You can only do so much for a person until you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t put your life on hold for her. Ask yourself this: if you needed help, would she help? Could you count on her?", "NTA but if she does lose her jobs expect more calls but looking for money this time.", "NTA. Your relationship with your sister has always been problematic. This is nothing new. Vacations are important for health. You have invested a good amount of money. Your decision also effects your bf. Your sister doesn\u2019t know what the ramifications of her situation will be. Perhaps it\u2019s time to go no contact. Don\u2019t let this ruin your vacation.", "Her poor planning is not your emergency. It\u2019s not always easy to rearrange plans, especially when others are involved and past experience shows her life is a circus. Do not let anyone guilt trip you into stretching yourself thin. Do what you can, when you can but know that sometimes you have to use tough love, or you will be left in a hole.", "NTA. And your parents should be the ones to keep the kids, not you.  I know you said they disowned her, but those are still their grandchildren.", "Under the circumstances, NTA.", "NTA", "What about your parents???? That\u2019s who can help her. She doesn\u2019t have any friends?", "NTA but if you can afford it, I would offer to help fund a sitter. Not all of it but some since she\u2019s broken your trust. It sucks because the kids are innocent but at the same time so are you in this situation due to her choices.", "Are you in the US? She can get FMLA for this to protect her job for a few months at least.", "NTA. It is too bad that her life decisions lead her to have to call a sibling after a year of silence. She has no one else nearby to take the kids. Who knows when she will take the children back. If ever. Those kids aren't your responsibility even if you were super close.", "NTA. You are not responsible. You don't even speak to her! In my eyes she is the one with the delusional gall to ask! She is the WHOLE A.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA. She should be protected under FMLA.", "NTA. Her history with you is enough to turn this down.", "NTA. Not your responsibility", "NTA but not because of the exact question you posed in the title. Your nta because this could potentially and very likely will be an altering event for her spouse and at the very least he isn\u2019t going to be able to watch the children while she works for some time. It doesn\u2019t sound like she has considered this and given some of the history you provided, I sort of feel like she will take advantage of you \u201cwatching\u201d the kids and it will be more like you \u201ctook the kids in\u201d. And she will come and go, showing up infrequently to get them and without notice to drop them off, all the while paying you nothing for child care costs, of course.", "NTA but also - your sister should talk to the hospital social worker. In some areas, there's something called a Crisis Nursery, which takes in kids (up to 18, usually) on a short term basis while their families are going through something where they're unable to be properly cared for. This seems like a good solution here.", "NTA. With the previous issues and non refundable trip, you have every right not to cancel. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty after everything she has done to you.  \n\nI would make sure your house is secure.  You need security cameras and someone actually watching your house.  You don\u2019t know what she may pull since she knows you won\u2019t be home.", "Your sister obviously has other relationships and attachments she has made in her life without you. It is time for her to call on those friendships now - not leave her kids with a stranger they hardly know. \n\nNTA", "Being a recovering addict and from a family of heavy drug use. I've seen some really awful shit. I've seen people make up the most heartbreaking stories, all for them to be false. I am 8 years sober. Got pregnant with my daughter almost two months after getting clean. \n\nMy mother would lie to me constantly. Saying she had cancer,  car needed fixing, the kids needed food and were starving. I got my siblings out of there. 2 are with me now and the youngest just went to college. Our mom died last year from sepsis. After her and step dad abandoned the entire family and lived on the streets for 4 years. \n\nYou should ask what hospital, call or go there to see if he is in fact there and his condition. For all you know is they are still using, haven't paid rent and are being evicted and she needs to pawn the kids off on you. Yes I've seen things like that happen, addicts will lie and say anything to pull your heartstrings to get what they want. It's worth checking. She could be telling the truth. But even if she is you aren't close to her and you don't even really know her kids. I'd help by maybe paying for a week or two of childcare, if I could. But her kids aren't your responsibility and with her history I would have some serious hesitation.", "You aren't under any obligation to take in her kids.

Your sister broke your trust too many times, so you really have no reason to believe her latest story. It\u2019s possible she wants to dump her kids on you fully so she can be free of responsibility. It\u2019s possible her husband didn\u2019t have a heart attack and she made it up to cause drama or guilt you into giving her free labor. \n\nGo no-contact. She\u2019s choosing, in adulthood, to be a user. You can choose to stop being used.", "I was going to say that you're TA, but $18,000 down the drain? Nope, never mind.

You don't owe it to her, but who knows where those children will end up.", "NTA but if you wanted to help her it would be cheaper for you to hire a babysitter for her or pay for daycare for however long your trip is. It\u2019s probably $3,000 for daycare for three children for one month.\n\nThough the 7 and 5 year old should be in school, so really just would need a Nanny or babysitter for evenings and the daycare for the youngest?", "Youre not obliged to take on other peoples kids. NTA.", "Are you kidding me She only called you bcz she immediately realized she has a childcare crisis.  NTA. Have a great anniversary trip. Hope you're going someplace extra special. Make your home really secure while you're gone in case of shenanigans.", "NTA. It\u2019s time to fully distance yourself, she\u2019s been using you, based on your description. Go on your trip and do not feel bad.", " NTA enjoy your holiday.\n\nDon\u2019t answer her calls while you are on it, or block her number and put an email redirect while you are away and filter her emails into a junk file.", "She can take fmla and be on short term disability if she has it.", "NTA. Ur sister is being so over dramatic. If she loses a few days of work, that will suck for the month. However, most places of work are pretty understanding when it comes to family emergencies.

And I feel bad for the kids that because their dad had a stroke they might go hungry. Maybe like help her pay for a sitter for a few weeks?", "Wow, most people really have absolutely no empathy on this sub. Answers like these are why this sub is so ridiculed elsewhere. \n\nCome on, the sister was abused by her parents growing up, then disowned for dropping out of college. Of course, that can very well lead to mental problems that can turn into drug use. But it sounds like she is pretty responsible now, working two jobs and taking care of three kids and a husband on disability. But sure, let's all just make all kinds of horrible assumptions about her, like she would abandon her children first chance she gets. And of course, it's all her own fault for not having a support system, WHEN HER PARENTS DISOWNED HER FOR A RIDICULOUS REASON?  Wow, just wow. She probably also caused her husband's stroke, inflation, and the war in Ukraine, now that we're at it, and she clearly deserves to suffer /s.\n\nThe number of people on here writing that she made her own shitty choices, and therefore, she deserves no sympathy in a situation she has absolutely no control over, is really horrifying. \n\nI am not saying OP is an asshole for not cancelling her trip, but neither is the sister for asking. And the right thing to do here is to offer sympathy and support to the extent that OP is capable of without comprising her own well-being, mental or otherwise.\n\nThe sister has previously done some bad things, sure. Sounds like it has been a direct result of the shitty parents' behaviour, and OP has probably gotten a lot more help from the parents to set up her life than the sister ever got, but of course the sister shouldn't have stolen from OP. She sucks for that, but that does not mean that she deserves to be in this horrible situation, and she has now only asked for help because it really is life or death. She is not begging for money to buy heroin. People on here must lead really hard lives to be this full of hatred and judgement.", "Go on your trip.\n\nYour sister is an adult and responsible for developing other options.", "You could maybe pay for 2 weeks of childcare. But I wouldn't want that money back. This is the most  human thing you could do for her and have some empathy, but also caring about the kids a bit. She needs you, but this is all you could do for her.", "NAH. You're obviously not an asshole to be cautious and not wasting 18k and PTO. But shes also not an asshole for coming to you for help. Yes its wromg she stole from you in the past but it sounds like your parents have failed her. It would be nice if you helped with daycare costs or paid for a babysitter tho.\n\nI am surprised your parents are cruel enough to abandon their grandchildren... Honestly the easiest option is your parents stop being petty and judgmental and put it aside for the wellbeing of their grandkids. Its either she leaves them alone or they go homeless... They actually hate her so much they feel no pity for their baby grandkids? Just because she went to a community college and partied??", "Keeping the kids out of foster care should be a priority. As many others have stated, you could pay a daycare provider directly to achieve that.\n\nHe'll be out of commission for months and if she doesn't work, they'll be homeless.

She was in hysterics and I stayed on the phone with her until she was able to make it to the hospital. She works and her partner stays home with the kids (I do believe he's on some sort of disability/unemployment benefit though). Together they have three kids who are 7, 5, and 2. \n\nHere's some background on me and my sister...we had actually not spoken for almost an entire year since her most recent call to me. We have a really strained relationship starting from our childhood, which was exacerbated by our parents. I'll be honest in saying that my parents always favored me and labeled my sister as a \"problem child.\" Since her teens, she's been involved with heavy drug use and partying. She graduated high school, but dropped out of community college. Our strict, traditional Asian parents shunned her from their lives after she dropped out of college. They effectively disowned her and pretend that they never had an older daughter. My parents haven't spoken a word to her in almost a decade and they have never met their grandchildren. \n\nFor the last decade, I've tried to maintain a positive relationship with my sister, but she's betrayed my trust too many times to count. Borrowing money and never returning it, stealing my items and pawning/selling them, bringing me into unnecessary drama in her life, etc. To be honest, I've been trying to distance myself from her for the last 3-4 years since she's caused me nothing but pain, stress, and suffering. \n\nThen last night, she called me again to let me know that her partner had suffered a severe stroke and had emergency surgery. The doctors say they are still very unsure of his prognosis. She then begged me to take in her children for the time being, saying how she can't afford any childcare and that she'll lose both her jobs if she's forced to stay with the children. \n\nNow here's the thing, me and my boyfriend's five-year anniversary is coming up. We've already bought tickets, requested PTO, and made accommodations for a two-week trip to Europe starting from this Friday. The total trip, including airfare, costed us $18,000, most of which is non-refundable. \n\nI told my sister I'd call her back and let her know after I spoke with my boyfriend. He said it was my choice completely. I decided that I wanted to go on our anniversary trip, which I had been looking forward to for a full year. \n\nI called my sister back and told her that I couldn't because of our trip. She started sobbing over the phone and lashed out at me, calling me cruel and selfish. She said that we could afford to just rebook our vacation and we didn't need that money back, but she was going to lose her job and her children if she couldn't find someone to take them in. \n\nIt was a really tough conversation, but I stuck with my decision. It's been almost a day since our call and I won't lie, I do feel a lot of guilt. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also, I assume you have a job (you said you took PTO for this trip) so how are you expected to look after these kids when you have a job yourself.", "NTA.  She should call someone else.  Pay a babysitter.", "I\u2019m wondering if he even had a stroke?  Sorry but she seems very good at running game.  This is a hard situation.  All I can say is imo your not at fault whatever you decide and it\u2019s kinda strange for her to expect help after you\u2019re the only one she\u2019s got, yet she plays you too.  No NTA", "NTA.  It's not your problem, and she painted her way into this corner by being an asshole to you for *years* \nMorally, I CAN see why this is bothering you, but you're really in the clear on this.  Go enjoy your vacation, and do yourself a favor and keep her blocked for the duration of it, there's no reason to let this be on your mind while you're away.\nFrankly, this is something your parents should be flexible about regarding just taking care of the kids, they haven't done anything to disappoint their grandparents!", "NTA. Your sister is reaping the consequences of her past actions. Yes, it is sad that her kids are also suffering the brunt but that is karma to you. Why didn't she ask your parents? If she was desperate enough, then she could approach them. I am sure that she could find a way and that you are not her only lifeline. How presumptive of her to say \"oh you don't really need that money\" as if she is fully aware of your finances. She chose her life, she wanted to be a bad girl so live out your bad life.", "NTA but how about getting your parents involved. They may have beef with their daughter but maybe they will step up for their grandchildren.", "NTA\n\nYou girls have been estranged for various reasons. Based on the reasons you've given, you should've gone no contact years ago.", "Nta. My wife is in the hospital right now. We have had friends and family watching the kids while I go stay with her.  We have a support system because we aren't a holes.\n\nAlso,  she can apply for fmla and her jobs shouldn't be able to fire her without risking a lawsuit.", "First of all NTA. Also, does your sister live in the United States, and if so, do you know how long she has been at her jobs? If it\u2019s been over a year, she should be covered under FMLA and her jobs wouldn\u2019t be at risk. Also, she should still be getting her husbands disability pay while he is in the hospital? \n\nBasically, I\u2019m just saying that there are other options for her besides the easiest thing she thinks of, which is using you, again. It would be one thing if you were close with your sister and her kids. To hear that you haven\u2019t even met 2 of her 3 kids. \n\nBy dropping your own plans and helping her out, you are just continuing to enable her.

Those children are the sisters responsibility. No OP.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure why you told her you would think about it / discuss with your boyfriend since that got her hopes up and made it sound like it was an option.\n\nYou just need to tell her that you will be out of the country and surely she has friends who can help.", "Unfortunately this is what happens when you burn bridges.\n\nNTA for not wanting to take her kids in. I feel awful for her in this situation, but you gotta think about yourself sometimes. I\u2019m assuming you and your boyfriend have jobs? How is that going to work with a two year old in the house? And you live four hours away from them apparently, so how are the other two getting to school?", "NTA but, if you don't want to feel guilty, her stated reason is she can't afford childcare, and you could give her some money to cover it.  Definitely don't take the kids in, it's highly unlikely you have space for 3 children or availability to watch them full time.", "NTA. Temporary babysitter/nanny is far cheaper than missing your vacation if you want to help them out. I'd set an amount you are comfortable giving first before discussing with her.

You had put a lot of time and money into this trip, NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf you want to help her, perhaps give her some money towards paying for childcare.  That would cost less than what you would lose from the nonrefundable trip fees, and you would not have to give up your long awaited vacation.", "NTA\u2014 you\u2019re allowed to say no.", "Nta doesn\u2019t she have any other support network?

Whilst I have huge empathy for the difficult situation your sister is in, I suspect from the history you\u2019ve given that if you give her an inch she will take a mile. \n\nYou\u2019re not close, and she should have other support networks that should step in here, if she doesn\u2019t, that in itself is a red flag.", "NTA. Enjoy your trip. Happy anniversary", "NTA.\nMaybe help pay some child care and possibly have a private conversation with your parents to let them know the situation, telling them that she doesn't know you're contacting them about her situation.

My mom went this route when step dad had a series of strokes. If husband is on disability then they will pay her to be his caretaker after taking a few hours of classes to become certified. \n\nIf she is worried about rent or mortgage payments, calling 221 can connect her with various programs that will assist with emergency rental & mortgage assistance.\n\nMore than likely she is too overwhelmed presently to research these things, so a showing of help via calling around and securing accurate information and contact numbers for places that can help her in these ways that you can then present to her while not being what she asked for or is focused on wanting from you, would still be helpful and kind.", "NTA", "For a trip like that you should've gotten travel insurance. That said NTA, I would've gone on the trip as well even with travel insurance. She hasn't talked to you in a year, she clearly has burnt many bridges. You take those kids they may not leave. Help pay for childcare temporarily if you feel so inclined but that's about it.", "NTA but offering to cover the cost of childcare for two weeks would be really kind and an olive branch to your sister in her time of need.

I started out like \u201cehhhh well, you probably could\u2019ve canceled it in this situation\u201d but the more I read the more drastically my opinion changed.

Besides, who normally looked after the children if both her and her partner work?", "NTA. The fact that she has nobody else to turn to but a sister who has been estranged for a year is telling of the kind of person she is.

Demanding such a thing (which your sister is doing) after the way she has treated you is an asshole thing though a major disaster like the one she's going through makes it a bit more understandable.\n\nChoosing to prioritise the major investment you have made to your anniversary trip is understandable as is reluctance to take the three kids for an indefinite period of time.

She's stolen, taken, and broken your trust.  She's abused your kindness and your generosity.

While I can't relate to your background I still have a feeling that your parents still keep her at the back of their mind. 10 years is a long time and I believe a true honest plea from you will help with making sure her children are looked after. Let them know how she reached out and it broke your heart to say no. Beg them to help on her behalf. Call them out if you have to and at least give them some brutal truths that you have been more than willing to be here. At least that way it can ebb a little at the guilt because you honestly aren't the only person that should be feeling it.

I do feel horrible for her, but at the same time, it's really tough for me to find the willpower to wire her money directly given that she's stolen thousands of dollars from me in the past. But again, we are definitely looking into finding a sitter and paying the sitter directly.\n\nTo end\u2014I will be going on the vacation. It's great to have the added support of my lovely boyfriend regarding my decision. I'm hoping he never sees this post since he doesn't use reddit, but another big reason I wanted to go on this trip is because I have a sneaking suspicion that he might propose. :,)", "Offering to pay to cover a sitter was my thought too. It sounds like OP would have the money and would solve the problem. Most likely the sister would be able to get help if she was able to pay decently. \n\nPossibly just throwing the money away, if the hesitation on this involves taking money previously to be used on drugs, I understand OP. Doesn't make you the bad person here. But it is a solution that gets you your vacation and helps her care for her partner and children.", "If OP can manage it, offering to pay for a babysitter is the right call here, I think.", "This is when she has to find out about community resources. What she's asking is too much. If you were close emotionally or physically to the kids, it might be different but she has no long-term plan except for you. She needs to talk to social services and the hospital to find out what resources are available to her.

From the perspective of the adults, hiring a total stranger and having them in your home and around your children, alone, is a *hugely* different scenario from hiring family.", "She sounds like the kind of person that pops out of nowhere whenever she needs something and then disappears after she gets it.", "I had to watch my best friend and her children lose 2 dads. I was friends with their bio-dad, and did whatever I could for her when he died. Later, she married my brother, who was my best friend, and sh3 became my SIL. My brother adopted the kids as his own. Then we lost him too. Now she and I are co-moms. I love them more than anything. I would do literally anything for them. \n\nI also have a terrible, entitled, racist, nasty sister. We never got along, and we have very little contact. If she called me out of no where with her husband dying, I could feel empathy for her, but she wouldn't appreciate it. I also would not cancel my trip\nIf no one else could take in her 4 kids for awhile, I'd offer to pitch in for a sitter, if I could. \n\nIt's okay to have empathy. Empathy should never be used as a weapon against you. Your sister is upset, and that is expected. But she is guilt tripping you into being her free baby sitter. Your SO is willing to cancel the trip if you want to. That is a person who loves you and appreciates your empathy. He is your priority. Guilt should never be the only connection you have with someone else, even family.", "I gotta say this is one of the ones I\u2019m the MOST conflicted in. There is NO good answer. \n\nIt\u2019s times like these families really NEED to step up for each other but also her sister sounds like a shit sister and if OP is anything like me 18k is a once in a decade or two possibility for a trip so to waste it is unimaginable.", "I disagree. It\u2019s her choice, she wouldn\u2019t be an AH either way.", "Why doesn\u2019t she have any support friends or other family during a time of crisis? Because she\u2019s incapable of creating a supportive environment by helping others. 18k plans you can\u2019t walk away from, you\u2019ve created your own healthy relationship.

No OP is not an AH. Clearly. \n\nBut everyone is taking into account the sister\u2019s past history as an addict, thief, drama mama. Fine.\n\nBut then if you take into account her *recent* history, then also take into account *the entire* back story. \n\nSis was disowned, parents made her the scapegoat, Op was golden child, sis was essentially emotionally abused and thrown away. \n\nIt\u2019s not like her drug use and downward spiral came out of nowhere. \n\nSo if her unreliable BS and drama are relevant to the judgement, then so should her backstory be relevant. \n\nOP is not an AH but there\u2019s a good reason she feels guilty and hopefully those kids don\u2019t go into the system. That would be tragic. \n\nThe parents are the true villains here.", "So you mean, normally op would be the bad guy for not wanting to throw 18.000$ into the lake?", "Agreed. Regardless of past history, of course sister would ask in this situation. OP also has a right to say no. That being said...things will be infinitely worse if sister loses both her jobs. I'd probably want to do something to make sure that doesn't happen. I mean, there's the wellbeing of three kids to consider , as well.", "That also feels like adulting by proxy. Sometimes there are just consequences. People who create crisis\u2019 won\u2019t stop.", "Yup. NAH. I can't understand these people who say that encourages OP to just abandon two children just because of the fault of their mother. \n\nThere should be something else that can be done to help them. If OP is not willing to give money for a babysitter for a while, then the sister should be open to the idea of having help from their mother. \n\nJust helping the sister until she gets aid from the government or any other entity will be a big help. As someone else said in this thread, the sister losing her jobs and children is infinitely worse and might put the sister in a place where she can never get back up from. \n\nMost of us advocate to be good to the homeless but when one is right in front of you at the verge of being that, you'd rather ignore? Do it for the kids, at least.\n\nFinally, it's unfair that this responsibility falls on OP's lap. That's true. But life isn't always fair, and people should just really strive to be a good person despite off that.", "Yeah, I honestly really worry about that too. Plus, me and my boyfriend live in an apartment in the city and we're about a four-hour drive from her place. Not even sure how I would begin to take care of a 5-year-old and a 2-year-old. I've also never even met her youngest children, only the oldest maybe 1-2 times so I'm not close with them at all.", "This is an excellent point.

Absolutely not.", "This is the way.", "NAH. I feel the same way. While IP\u2019s sister has not done anything to desserve her help- she\u2019s in a very sad situation.

They are not close. If they had been more in each other's life, then that might be different, but they weren't. It's not her fault for what happens with the children.

It is a medical emergency", "I agree with you & am amazed at everyone justifying OP.  If this had been sister posting, everyone would call OP the AH.  This is along the lines I was thinking.  \n1.  I have had little to no relationship with my sister for 15 years, but I would not be able to abandon her (or her kids) in a similar situation\u2026.and she lives 2000 miles from me.\n2.  Why would you plan a big trip without travel insurance?  What if it was one of your parents who had the stroke?  My husband and I travel frequently & always purchase it\u2026and have used it.\n3.

And OP decides to distance herself AFTER her sister gets clean and starts a family? Whatever. It\u2019s an excuse to not feel guilty and get everyone on her side. Which, whatever. I don\u2019t care that she doesn\u2019t want to not go on her expensive vacation to help her sister but I do care that people are making wild accusations based on that. \n\nDo you feel better, OP?

The most OP could really do is help arrange and pay for childcare in the sister\u2019s town (again, FOUR HOURS AWAY).

Four hours away also mean it is an 8 hours roundtrip to allow the sister to visit her kids, which means if this become long term, the sister will be barely be able to see her kids.

Four hours away means the older kids would need to change schools, and the younger kids would need either OP or her husband to be a SAHP.

Everything was going well, no issues. Then the optician used some kind of machine that lets you look into the eye, and apparently also part of the brain, where he discovered a clot. Partner was immediately rushed to hospital. He phoned me from there as I was home. He had already had several strokes, but they were basically asymptomatic. \n\nOver the next six months, he had several more, many of which were not asymptomatic. It affected his speech.

If he did, he\u2019s the only one who perceives it.\n\nHe still has the clot that was discovered at the optician\u2019s that day. It was so \u201cstuck\u201d (pardon that excessive medical jargon :p) that the doctors said it would be riskier trying to dislodge it, and new blood vessels had formed around it so its removal wasn\u2019t strictly necessary anymore.

As someone who is also Asian and was raised by very traditional Asian parents, I know what it\u2019s like. Except it\u2019s a bit different for me. My sister was always favored by my mom. My mom had always blamed me for my bio dad leaving. My sister is older. The reason my bio dad left was because I was a girl and he wanted a boy. \n\nGrowing up, my sister would steal and skip school. She was arrested a few times as a teen for shoplifting. Her grades were average. But she did household chores. I was a straight A Honor student. I\u2019ve never been in trouble with the law. Not only did I do household chores, I even had a job in addition to extracurricular activities at school. But I was still the black sheep of the family. Growing up perpetually being told you\u2019re not wanted and getting anger directed at you only because the other child was favored, it was traumatic. My stepdad was also abusive and I\u2019d get the brunt of it. Because of that trauma and several additional traumas in my life, I do have issues creating a social circle. I have major trust issues. I avoid people and talking to people. I avoid any situation that can put me in an uncomfortable position. Therefore, if I\u2019m not at work then I\u2019m at home. \n\nI\u2019m a scientist so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m a loser who hasn\u2019t accomplished anything in life. \n\nI occasionally check in with my mom but she still makes it clear that she doesn\u2019t give a damn about me. When she calls, it\u2019s only to check on my daughter. And she let me know she only calls me to check in on my daughter. When I need help, I\u2019ll ask for help. But that rarely happens and it\u2019s only when I\u2019m desperate because I will suck up my pride for the sake of my daughter. However, my mom says I never check in to make sure she\u2019s okay. She tells people I only reach out when I need something.\n\nMy point is, there\u2019s always two sides to a story. Emotional abuse takes a huge toll on a person. And since you did mention that you\u2019ve always been favored, it leads me to think that your sister was acting out to get attention. When you\u2019re neglected by your parents and made to feel unwanted and unworthy, attention is attention whether it\u2019s bad or good.\n\nSo I\u2019ll story at that.

OP made it clear that her parents favored her and scapegoated older sister.

Typically in that family dynamic OP is framed as \"more worthy\" of opportunity which is a mind-fuck because all children are equally deserving of love. It puts OP in the position to either: self-sabotage because of guilt, have crazy sense of entitlement, or create a wicked co-dependent siblingship in adulthood.  \n\nOP: You arent equipped to fix your sisters situation. It is absolutely tragic. You deserve the vacation you planned, and you deserve to be happy about it. All of these things are true at the same time!! Honestly I think you should seek therapy if you havent already, especially if youre planning on building forever with your boyfriend. I was also the favorite and I got married while my brother was in jail. It sucks but its also not your situation to 'fix'.  \n\n**Idea:** if money isnt an issue, do you have any coworkers with kids who could recommend a nanny/babysitter?

I was feeling lightheaded when I'd walk from my car to my office. Thought it might be my blood pressure medicine not working any more but planned to make an appointment with my regular gp. In the meantime I went to a yearly eye exam and the optometrist sent me directly (no waiting for an appointment) to a retina doctor. He examines me and sends me directly to the ER with an order to take spinal fluid to relieve pressure in my brain and eyes. Turns out this saved me from an immanent stroke. I had cranial hypertension. Never heard of it until that day.\n\nThe lightheadedness I experienced was indeed due to my blood pressure medication not working anymore (this was confirmed with a next day appointment the retina doctor scheduled for me with a cardiologist).

As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware since you\u2019re chronically ill as well, sometimes doctors see a young person and assume nothing can be acutely wrong as long as they\u2019re not actively bleeding or coding. It sucks. I\u2019m glad your friend went to a different hospital! It\u2019s so easy to convince yourself nothing serious can be wrong if doctors have dismissed you. They\u2019d know, right?
