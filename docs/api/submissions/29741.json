But between them traveling together, spending a lot of time together, and now her wanting them to dress as a couple\u2026 are you absolutely sure there\u2019s nothing else going on?", "NTA. This does seem weird. My bet is that she has a thing for your husband or at least likes the idea of having a 'work husband' and is bad at boundaries.

Matching costumes - Yikes!  It's creepy and your feelings are completely rational. \n\nNot to mention is a really stupid career move.

Why do you have a problem with them wearing matching costumes if you're confident there's nothing between them?

I think for me, what some people aren\u2019t getting is that the optics of matching boy/girl costumes are usually reserved for romantic couples (which isn\u2019t to say that\u2019s always the case, but it\u2019s most common). Even if they went as Weird Barbie and Allen, it\u2019s still essentially a couples\u2019 costume.

As it is, it sounds like they\u2019ve just got quite a strong platonic friendship, which is something to be admired really.

You missed the funny bit, of course I understood", "This comment intentionally walks past a lot of context in the post. You\u2019re taking one segment and going \u201cthis isn\u2019t suspicious for my life so this isn\u2019t sus for you\u201d. The costume bit, in addition to everything else, makes the whole picture sus - not the little bit you\u2019re focused on.", "Get your head out of the sand.", "Yes it would *definitely* look sus if 2 guys or w/e insisted doing all of this stuff together lmao. I get the point that you're trying to make, but two women/men, that aren't even coworkers but boss/subordinate frequently going away together and even dressing up as a couple doesn't scream platonic work relationship. Especially if you don't know that the wife is there all the time.", "This comment comes off as being intentionally dense to the rest of the context. There\u2019s a lot more in the post that makes this situation as a whole sus.", "Nah man my neck is all the way out and stuck that way", "Yes bc the entire affair is predicated on a FUCKING COSTUME! Do you even hear your own thoughts you're typing? It's more than idiotic.", "Because some people are incredibly dense in certain realms of social dynamics and problem solving.", "The wife isn't coming to the party... He wants to dress up for it...your comment should go in the garbage.", "Ya I\u2019m not an insecure girlfriend but if my boyfriend told me he was gonna go dress in a couples costume with another girl I would count it as complete disrespect. And I know for 100% he would not be comfortable if I did it with another guy. Ya going out with his friends is fine, a group costume is fine but a bloody couples costume is so far passed the line", "And you\u2019re disregarding OPs comments.", "Disagree. It's the kind of thing that could totally delight their co workers because its unexpected. And the movie disputes Barbie and Ken as a couple. Just saying.", "OP herself doesn't even feel threatened. It's only people in this sub that respond with things as: He's cheating!", "oh yeah and one must have have zero involvement in brainstorming for any activities one\u2019s spouse partakes in solo, I completely forgot... you know you can plan stuff alongside your partner even if your partner won\u2019t be participating? Some might even find it fun to help their partner plan a costume for a party. That kind of engagement is the default in my house", "You're not putting yourself in the wife's shoes either. Your judging based on your little fuck boy bf and making claims. She goes with this man on work trips and he wants them with him as often as possible. Either he doesn't care about his chance to cheat being blown up by his wife coming along at any opportunity, OR and this is gonna sound crazy, HES NOT SNEAKING AROUND AT ALL.", "I\u2019ve seen the movie and still disagree. There\u2019s a whole context of Ken and Barbie being a couple, it\u2019s a popular couple\u2019s costume, there is an undertone very present. \n\nIt\u2019s just plain weird to purposefully seek to do that with a coworker you aren\u2019t involved with and who is actively married to someone else. I\u2019m not accusing cheating, I am accusing weird.", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d jump to cheating - I just think it\u2019s a weird emotional boundary to cross with someone you just work with. I don\u2019t assume infidelity, but I do see the weird.", "If my gf/wife was choosing my shit out of insecurity of appearance, when there's not a single other issue, I'm not going to take their option as valid. You're saying just use the excuse of her helping him to make it seem normal. That's literally the shit people do to cover up abusive relationships, coming up with reasonable excuses to make it seem like it isn't the spouse telling you what to do.", "Lol my \u201cfuck boy bf\u201d has respect for me and isn\u2019t clueless so would never do this or even dream of doing it. Wife clearly has a problem with it or wouldn\u2019t be here ya dope. It isn\u2019t even about cheating its about respect. You just don\u2019t do a couples outfit with someone that isn\u2019t your partner. Op clearly feels the same or wouldn\u2019t have wrote this bloody post. I don\u2019t think the husband would cheat either, I think ops husband is clueless and the co worker is taking complete advantage of that what made him an asshole was after the fact wife told him he wasn\u2019t comfortable so his compromise was to inform the whole team. Husband is just clueless which makes him an ass. Sounds like you\u2019re pretty clueless too", "You fucked up by giving anyone on Reddit more than 2 chances to prove to you they aren't capable of critical thinking.", "Especially when it's your boss", "Maybe not you, but just read the comments. It's horrific.\n\nAbout crossing boundaries: who decides on those boundaries? Apparently it's not a boundary crossed for OP's husband and the employee. And maybe the context of their office is that the familiarity between them is considered normal. I believe that these two adults can make a good judgement on whether it is appropriate within their context. Of course OP can give her views on that and warn her husband, but ultimately, it's his choice.", "So the husband couldn't do a ken vs ken costume competition or even a woody and Jessie/bo peep costume collab with his best male friend at the office?"]}
