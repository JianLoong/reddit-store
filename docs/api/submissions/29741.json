But between them traveling together, spending a lot of time together, and now her wanting them to dress as a couple\u2026 are you absolutely sure there\u2019s nothing else going on?", "NTA. This does seem weird. My bet is that she has a thing for your husband or at least likes the idea of having a 'work husband' and is bad at boundaries.

Why do you have a problem with them wearing matching costumes if you're confident there's nothing between them?

I think for me, what some people aren\u2019t getting is that the optics of matching boy/girl costumes are usually reserved for romantic couples (which isn\u2019t to say that\u2019s always the case, but it\u2019s most common). Even if they went as Weird Barbie and Allen, it\u2019s still essentially a couples\u2019 costume.

It starts to look like sexual harrassment (at very least) in the work place, and whether just perceived or not, can cause HR in large corporations to let someone like your husband go, whether he's guilty or not, just based on what they might consider poor choices he makes , and potential legal ramifications.

Just consider if this is in your thoughts at all because it can affect how you phrase your concerns to him and how he views them if there have been discussions about this in the past. Sometimes it\u2019s not what you say but how you say it is my point. And he needs to hear it. It looks bad. \n\nAnd in a corporate environment, sometimes the appearance of impropriety is more important for team moral, career advancement, and the gossip mill than the reality. And this is especially true for direct superiors/subordinates that are close, travel, and spend private time together in AND out of the office. Sometimes it is innocent but looks bad. And this is because a lot of the time it starts innocent but after spending that much time together, it doesn\u2019t end that way and everyone has seen it happen (or done it themselves).  \n\nIf there isn\u2019t a formal theme then asking the team, or better yet, talking to the team about a theme is a great team building activity. This is because it became a team activity. But announcing \u201cthis is what your two bosses are doing and we are dressing up like a famous boyfriend and girlfriend\u201d is a bad idea. It just looks bad and leads malicious people to make assumptions. And you are right to point this out. PLUS the boss should not be trying to win a costume competition meant for the rank and file employees. It\u2019s taking something from them which you should NEVER do. And it\u2019s tacky. \n\nThen as a lawyer, I have to say that companies are terrified of employment law claims, especially sexual harassment. Defending and settling them is incredibly expensive. Think $50k-$100k in fees and costs for iffy claims and more for solid ones. So if a problematic relationship appears to exist from the company perspective, they will either split the them up, write them up and punish them both, or find a reason or invent one to fire your husband as the superior in the \u201crelationship\u201d.

People need to open their eyes on work-wife/work-husband. It\u2019s not usually as innocent as the parties involved make it out to be. At least one has inappropriate intentions if not both", "You\u2019re making excuses for others to blur the lines of what\u2019s appropriate. \u201cWork-wife\u201d is certainly not an innocent thing. Every single ex boyfriend I have had, as well as other men I knew, that had a \u201cwork-wife\u201d, absolutely crossed the line with physicality with that person. It starts as harmless yet questionable flirting. And becomes so much more.

It\u2019s all very dubious and a very slippery slope to condone. \n\nAlso, in terms of two managers wearing matching costumes\u2026 even if they aren\u2019t having a physical relationship, it is absolutely in poor taste, and will generate rumors among the staff. This is terrible on so many levels. OP\u2019s husband is prospective Barbie\u2019s BOSS.  Not sure how you can\u2019t see how messed up it is that she wants to wear matching costumes. Matching costumes are for couples, especially when those matching costumes are couples themselves. Not sure why you don\u2019t see this. Would you find Morticia and Gomez to be similarly appropriate? Sid and Nancy? Miss Piggy and Kermit? The Joker and Harley Quin? Marilyn Monroe and JFK? Hugh Hefner and a Playboy Bunny? Just throwing these out there to help you see why it\u2019s inappropriate.\n\nAnd the husband\u2019s solution\u2026 emailing his team to also wear matching costumes, now looks like he is trying to get the team to cover up an affair.

It\u2019s just a costume that people are reading into wayyy too much. I would be chill and help out with edgy Ken\u2019s makeup lol. Also people are conveniently leaving out that Barbie rejects Ken throughout the movie and they both accept being friends in the end, so idk why people aren\u2019t viewing it through that angle.

About the Barbie and Ken outfit idea it is relevant to know who suggested it. If it was the female coworker there's something there (not saying she's trying anything, but at least she might have a one sided crush and your husband should be aware and start to be more careful and try to let her down subtly at first and firmly if that doesn't work). If it was your husband's idea and he just didn't think it through, then she probably agreed because he is technically her boss and also if they're close she might have thought \"it's a little weird, but ok, I trust him\" and just gone with it. In that case your husband should apologize to her for putting her in a situation where her reputation might suffer too and say that he never thought of romantic entanglement and how he just values her as a co-worker and friend.

He must be Barbie, and she must be Ken.", "Say your husband truly is not interested in her because you've stated that you feel safe in the relationship, that does not mean his coworker feels the same.

They\u2019re symbols meant to represent a life where women can be anything they want.", "What's next - gotta lie to the wife about where the boss and work-wife are?", "That\u2019s fair, but the suggestion that she overstepped an implied boundary that he had, on a very sensitive topic mind you, could easily introduce an air of needing to step on eggshells where there needn\u2019t be one. \n\nIf him and her are perfectly content with their professional dynamic besides this one single thing - a relatively harmless thing - then in husband\u2019s mind, he\u2019d need to ask himself if it\u2019s really worth potentially damaging his workplace comfort - something he needs to deal with on a daily basis, just to placate OP on something that she really has nothing to do with. \n\nAgain, this is assuming that both OP\u2019s husband and the other manager are acting appropriately in other regards, which we\u2019ve been given no reason not to believe (despite Reddit\u2019s tendency to way overshoot the landing and jump to wild conclusions to validate their own personal feelings). If there\u2019s additional information we\u2019re not privy to, that the female manager has acted inappropriately, then setting a boundary would be more appropriate. \n\nAs it stands these are two professionals who work closely together and are friends. It\u2019s not a new relationship where the husband needs to reign in a woman and let her know what is an is not appropriate.", "Seriously. I\u2019ve ended up with people being so miserable and back stabbing to me, that at this point I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m the problem. Like I\u2019m cursed to bring out the worst in people, so I distance myself from the few friends that are awesome, bc I don\u2019t want whatever is in my air to bring that out in them. They\u2019re so amazing and if they turned out like the majority, that would just be kind of heartbreaking. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how some people will take advantage of the trust someone great has in them. And then pride themselves on it, or like you mentioned, flip the blame bc,\u201dwell you should have been suspicious.\u201d", "You could say any boundary is \u201ccontrolling.\u201d \n\nThe question is whether the boundary is reasonable. This one definitely is.", "I can see your point but to me that's a them problem. There's always gonna be gossip regardless what you do and gossip is irrelevant imo. With that being said, after I had time to think about it I realized I'm coming from a place of privilege that that's just not something I have to think about with my job and never has been or will be. If my life had taken a different path and given me different experiences then my opinion may have been much different though", "Yup. I have an ex-friend who warms up to other women\u2019s husbands/boyfriends and acts like it\u2019s no big deal if they cross the line with her bc she is also friends with the wife. Whenever the wife/gf eventually finds out, they are obviously not okay with it.", "The group costume concept came after the fact. And if the group doesn't all do it it them it reverts back to being a couples costume. It may have been influenced by the movie, but in the cultural, sociological mindset of the world Ken and barbie are a defacto couple. Mary might have well suggested they dress as bride amd groom as far as the optics go.", "All these people you keep arguing with have told you over and over they are NOT assuming he is having an affair, they believe OP when they say he isn't. They are saying that people at work based on the couples costume, the being close and traveling together, and then the email to then try to include others to cover up the couples costume, will absolutely ASSUME they ARE having one, no matter what the truth is. Idk y it is so hard for you to understand, esp since you think people here are jumping to conclusions do you honestly think people at work won't? It's human fricken nature to do that. There is prob already rumors regardless of the truth because people LOVE to gossip. The truth that he isn't cheating isn't the point at all of this. The wife knows people will gossip and it makes her uncomfortable and husband ignored her concerns, or rather, made it worse when he tried to fix it.", "He could have just said the truth \"no we're not a couple and it's not appropriate for a boss and his employee to dress like we are.\"", "of course yeah! Just saying that when people say \u2018oh I didn\u2019t want to make it awkward\u2019 in response to situations like OP\u2019s, they\u2019re somehow forgetting that the world\u2019s most socially acceptable and completely normal excuse is having a spouse that you already have plans with. I understand being nonconfrontational and trying not to make a workplace weird but also I don\u2019t know anyone who I\u2019d consider normal who would give someone grief for being like, in this case, \u2018oh my wife and I already planned to go shopping for a costume and we\u2019re making a day of it, you should definitely go as Barbie though, that\u2019s cool!\u2019", "You\u2019re saying I\u2019ve suggested \u2018my wife and I are working on a costume on the weekend\u2019 as cover for \u2018my wife is abusively telling me how to dress\u2019? that\u2019s not what my comment says; I\u2019m suggesting that if someone came up to me in my workplace and was like \u2018hey married coworker, let\u2019s do a couples costume\u2019, the most socially acceptable way to get out of it if I knew my partner would think it would be weird would be to just say \u2018hey nah my wife and I already planned to brainstorm ideas together for it this weekend, thanks for the suggestion though\u2019 (or saying some version of it later I found out that they were uncomfortable) as a way to deflect.\n\nIf you and your partner are fine with it that\u2019s cool, I wouldn\u2019t be and neither are a number of other people in this comment section, and gently taking your partner\u2019s feelings and reactions into account is often perfectly healthy and not a symptom of abusive relationships\u2026 do I really need to list out every possible nuance to this situation? Yes it *can* be a sign of insecurity, yes it *can* be a sign of controlling behaviour, etc, but in an otherwise healthy relationship there is so truly nothing wrong with being like \u2018okay my partner has a weird feeling about this so I\u2019m going to put their feelings above my coworker\u2019s\u2019. Obviously\u2026"]}
