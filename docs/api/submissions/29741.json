I\u2019m married and no way would I be comfortable with my husband doing this with another woman. Ken and Barbie are a couple. They\u2019re essentially \u201cplaying\u201d a couple for Halloween.\n\nAsk him if he\u2019s cool with you playing a single woman and going out on Halloween dressed as a bachelorette. If he is having a hard time understanding the optics of this maybe that will get through to him.", "She should be weird Barbie and he can be Allen.", "Ya that's weird. Does your husband have other direct reports, other than this woman? If yes, then this type of behavior shows pretty clear favoritism. \n\nAlso, Ken was like... desperately chasing Barbie. it's a weird look for a boss to wear the costume of someone desperately romantically chasing his direct report. NTA & also does this company have an HR department?", "NTA. Matching Ken and Barbie costumes with a coworker, especially when he's her boss, just screams \"bad optics\" for all to see. You're not even invited to the party and they're planning on going as an iconic couple? Your husband's \"fix\" isn't fixing anything; it's just spreading the awkwardness around.", "NTA. But between them traveling together, spending a lot of time together, and now her wanting them to dress as a couple\u2026 are you absolutely sure there\u2019s nothing else going on?", "NTA. This does seem weird. My bet is that the boss has a thing for your husband or at least likes the idea of having a 'work husband' and is bad at boundaries. Husband can be clueless, or mostly clueless and enjoys the attention. If he's actually cheating, he's doing it in the most stupid way possible, but that doesn't discount the possibility. Because people are often stupid.", "Uhhh, obviously NTA but what\u2019s your guy doing? That\u2019s weird. I mean fr.", "The movie had several of BFF Ken and Barbs where was no romance.  They could dress as one of those pairs-like her being the science one.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be romantic, that was part of the point", "NAH\n\nI definitely don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for being uncomfortable and explaining your concerns to him (I would be too) but it doesn\u2019t sound like he or the employee are actively being AHs either, especially since the employee was transparent with you directly from the start about the costumes. Sounds like your husband was trying to fix it with his email but went about it the wrong way. I\u2019d sit him down and have another conversation with him about it and see how that goes\n\nI do firmly agree it\u2019s a bad idea for him to dress as Ken and his direct report to dress as Barbie\u2026 Maybe show him this thread if he\u2019s receptive to that and needs an outside perspective", "NTA\n\nOh boy, this is taking work-wife to the next level. Matching costumes - Yikes!  It's creepy and your feelings are completely rational. \n\nNot to mention is a really stupid career move. Manager of the smaller office showing up at the corporate event in a couples costume with a direct report? That is just announcing to people he has poor judgment. Not to mention there has to be at least one person on their team who is totally uncomfortable with this whole situation. This is a big mess that is just waiting to blow up.", "NTA because I think it\u2019s fine that you weren\u2019t into this and expressed that. And his way of handling it wasn\u2019t too slick. \nThat being said I don\u2019t think I\u2019d care a ton if my husband did this with a coworker. As long as you\u2019re confident nothings\u2019 going on. Although the whole boss dynamic does have an extra level of sketch for sure.", "Wtf? NTA", "NTA \n\nI find it bizarre that your husband doesn't see a problem with this. I wouldn't do a couples costume with anyone but my wife. There are plenty of other options for co-workers who want a theme.", "NTA\n\nI will say that he tried to fix the situation, but I feel like you should have offered a better solution (that he match with a male coworker). Any costume that required male/female matching would have created an issue.", "NAH. Me and the coworker who assists me got stuck being Mr and Mrs potato head for a mandatory themed work party. His wife was much more amused than we were. It could easily just be fun.", "Has your husband not seen the movie? Does he not realize Ken in the film is mostly about desperately wanting Barbie to love him and that he is nothing without her?\n\nYou are 100% correct on the optics. This looks really, really BAD.", "NAH - I can see your point of view that people could misunderstand the matching costumes but equally you are confident there's nothing going on there so a matching costume shouldn't really be a big deal. \n\nI think your husbands email is an attempt to make you more comfortable by making it a group costume for the whole office but just terribly worded.", "NAH, but I'm a little confused. Why do you have a problem with them wearing matching costumes if you're confident there's nothing between them? Especially now that the movie has come out, where it is explicitly stated that Ken and Barbie are not a couple, not in love, and don't even end up in the same universe.", "This sub is weird.  There was a post a couple weeks ago where everyone said the husband was TA for not wanting his wife to go on a nude camping trip with her male friends and all sleeping in the same tent, because it's her body and she can show it to whoever she wants.\n\nThen there's this post, where everyone says OP is not TA and this husband is up to something with Ken/Barbie Halloween costumes.\n\nIs it just an anti-male thing?", "[deleted]", "This post was a roller coaster because at first I thought you were being ridiculous but then I changed my mind because I understand the optics but then I changed it again because he solved the problem by asking the whole team to go in on the theme.\n\nI don\u2019t think you are an ah but I think if the whole team goes in on it then the optics problem is gone.", "Well, at least hey didn't ask you to be Midge. \n\nSeriously, maybe you're not as confident and trusting as you think, so maybe that's what you should be thinking about.", "Stage a mixup with the costumes and have him go as the Jager bomber", "I'd ask him to check with HR about the perceptions and if they had no objections... neither would I.\n\nNAH", "NTA. Your jealousy seems to be warranted. It is not a good look and I would think HR could get involved at some point given the lack of boundary this direct report has with your husband. Clearly, your husband is acting willfully oblivious and he is part of the problem.", "NTA.  And why on earth does an office, a place of business, feel the need to act like children and don costumes for a holiday that might have had meaning at one point but is now nothing but a way for candy and costume manufacturers to get a head start on Xmas revenue.  This whole idea is ridiculous.", "NTA - This is quickly going to become an emotional affair if it isn\u2019t already and then a physical affair if it isn\u2019t already.

Is there anything else going on? Hmm.", "NTA. Ken and Barbie are a romantic couple. It would be different if the entire staff dressed up as Power Rangers or something, but the couples costume is weird and inappropriate.\n\nAlso, while your husband my not be interested in employee, she may be interested in him. Advise your husband to be very mindful of and measure his relationship with her. It\u2019s weird that your husband doesn\u2019t feel comfortable just telling her no.

I understand you feeling like it would look weird, but it also sounds like it was innocent in spirit. People are oddly insecure in the comments.

Boundaries?? even if nothing is going on, wtf??", "This made me laugh out loud :) thank you for the solidarity", "I even had problems with my boyfriend having matching skins in a videogame with his female co-player (what do you call people you play videogames with), matching costumes I would most definitely be suspicious that there was something going on behind my back.", "if someone dresses as Freddy Krueger for Halloween, do you perceive them as having a real life desire to murder people", "Great compromise.", "This right here.

I travel with him too because it\u2019s fun and I can do my job from anywhere. He spends all his free time with me and our kids.

They're now going to feel obligated to participate in the weird team costume to hide the weird couple's costume this woman already initiated. He also didn't bother talking to OP before sending this email, he basically completely ignored her concerns and just decided he was going to do it anyway", "Well, personally, some people in my office opt to dress up for Halloween - just because it\u2019s fun.  They like having fun.  Work here is often hard, so a little optional cheerfulness is good.  Around a fifth of our staff dress up yearly.\n\nDo you not know any geeks?  Cosplay is a hobby for rather a lot of people.  And far more folks enjoy a simple Halloween costume.\n\nCostumes at work I know about this year - a nudibranch, a rosy maple moth, an Ent (amazing, he 3D printed and modded chunks of his costume), the Great Pumpkin (likes to hand out candy to coworkers), a wood elf, a TRex, and Indiana Jones.  Including a hand painted golden idol but minus the bullwhip, no weapons allowed in my workplace.

Maybe she\u2019s interested in your husband and this matching costume idea is a way to show her interest. I agree with you, the optics are bad, and he made it worse.
