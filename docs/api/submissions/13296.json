{"id": 13296, "submission_id": "123ftxt", "title": "AITA For Asking My Husband to Include Our Children When Spending Time with His Estranged Son?", "selftext": "   I am a 45-year-old woman who has been married to my husband, Fred, for 20 years. We have four children, including my 24-year-old stepson, James. When Fred and I first met, he was still married to James' mother, Lily. We fell in love, but we didn't do anything physical until after their divorce was final.\n   \nI met James when he was five years old, and over the almost 20 years that I have known him, he has never liked me. Despite my best efforts to build a relationship with him, he has never shown any interest in getting to know me or his siblings.\n   \nWhen James turned 18, he left home, and while he would occasionally call and spend time with Fred, he would never do so with me or our children. Recently, I asked Fred to include our children when he spends time with James, but James has not spoken to him since.\n   \nNow, my mother-in-law, who has always favored Lily over me, has called me and accused me of being the AH for hurting James and Fred's relationship \"even further.\"\n  \n I understand that my request may have hurt James' feelings, but after almost two decades of trying to build a relationship with him, I feel that I have exhausted all other options. I love my husband and our children, and I want them to feel included and valued in our family. It's not fair for James to exclude them from his life with Fred simply because he has a strained relationship with me.\n   \nI believe that it's important for families to come together and support one another, especially during difficult times. James is a part of our family, and I want him to know that he is welcome to spend time with us, but not at the expense of my children's feelings or our family dynamic.\n  \n I understand that James may be hurt, but I hope that he can see that our family is important to us, and that we want him to be a part of it.", "created_utc": 1679903919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123ftxt/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_include_our/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had an emotional affair with a married man which lead to the break down of his marriage and his son wasn't happy about it?

If family was that important to you, why have you destroyed one ?", "You could literally be my Sons stepmother ! She speaks like this. She constantly inserts herself and tells EVERYONE what she wants and what she is feeling. \n\nAs a result, my son (who is now 20) has almost no contact with his father. \n\nAnytime he arranges to see his Dad or tries to make plans with him, his stepmother will insert herself and try get involved with the plans and try change things so that she has the last say in everything. She will send my son messages trying to change a plan him and his Dad have made. \nMy ex's family all dislike her, as she does the same thing with them as well and is constantly trying to tell people how awful my son is. My son went from spending half his time with his Dad to only going once a month, then when he turned 16, he stopped going all together. This caused his family to grow further apart from his wife. \nThere is probably a reason they prefer his ex! \n\nYou are harming your husbands relationship with his child.

Fred has spent more time with you and your kids than he did James. Fred has every right to see his kid one on one. And James has every right to not want to be bothered by you or your kids.

This may not be true, but im sure his dad falling in love with another woman didnt help his first marriage. At 5 years old your step son put 2 and 2 together, that is, things went wrong when you showed up. He doesnt want a relationship with you because he kept the chip on his shoulder.\n\nAs far as hes concerned, his half siblings are fruits of  that situation which he doesnt care for. You cant force this. \n\nThe most likely scenario? You pressure your husband into taking your kids with him, then James sees them and says nah, have fun with your family and leaves.\n\nThis is not an easy situation for anyone, but you applying pressure for no good reason is giving James a good reason to hate you", "YTA. He's 24, leave him the hell alone.", "Yeah, family is clearly important to you\u2026.

You are the reason he didn't have a complete family growing up.\n\nIt's his choice to not want to know you or your kids. Don't be TA and force a relationship between you all.

If you think that your marriage to his father makes you a family you are just delusional, you married his father not him, you're not blood related, he owes you nothing, he has every right not to see you and your children as part of his family and it was clear right away about this especially since he knows about you're emotional affair with his dad (you may have even started dating after the divorce but the feelings between you both preceded this and it's because of those feelings that his father left his mother, so in his eyes you are and always will be the one who destroyed his family no matter how hard you try or how nice you are towards him and honestly he has every right to feel that way). The only thing you can do is respect his boundaries and stop with this attitude because it will make you hated even more by him (right now you sounds like the classic step-mom that wants all the attention for her and her kids), If you want your children to spend time with their father, make sure they do it when he's not visiting.\n\nP.S: i'm sorry if i made some grammar mistakes but english is  not my primary language", "Y\n\nT\n\nA", "This was exhausting\u2026 YTA", "YTA\n\nJames knows full well that you\u2019re the reason his father left his mother.

We have four children, including my 24-year-old stepson, James. When Fred and I first met, he was still married to James' mother, Lily. We fell in love, but we didn't do anything physical until after their divorce was final.\n   I met James when he was five years old, and over the almost 20 years that I have known him, he has never liked me. Despite my best efforts to build a relationship with him, he has never shown any interest in getting to know me or his siblings.\n   When James turned 18, he left home, and while he would occasionally call and spend time with Fred, he would never do so with me or our children. Recently, I asked Fred to include our children when he spends time with James, but James has not spoken to him since.\n   Now, my mother-in-law, who has always favored Lily over me, has called me and accused me of being the AH for hurting James and Fred's relationship \"even further.\"\n   I understand that my request may have hurt James' feelings, but after almost two decades of trying to build a relationship with him, I feel that I have exhausted all other options. I love my husband and our children, and I want them to feel included and valued in our family. It's not fair for James to exclude them from his life with Fred simply because he has a strained relationship with me.\n   I believe that it's important for families to come together and support one another, especially during difficult times. James is a part of our family, and I want him to know that he is welcome to spend time with us, but not at the expense of my children's feelings or our family dynamic.\n   I understand that James may be hurt, but I hope that he can see that our family is important to us, and that we want him to be a part of it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He didn\u2019t worship you or your children so you finished off what little relationship he had with his dad. Are you proud of yourself yet?\n\nThe fact is it\u2019s not your kids fault, however they grew up having the life your stepson should have if you and his father had not destroyed it. So I get why he doesn\u2019t want walking talking constant reminder of the life he missed out on.\n\nfyi no wonder your mil favors your husbands ex. She feels ashamed her son would abandon his family for you. And your mil probably sees you as the home wrecker just like your stepson does. That why she doesn\u2019t like you and favors his ex and your stepson.\n\nYou can\u2019t force a relationship between your stepson and your children. Your stepson will only hate you more. He will also resent and hate them even more. Does it suck your kids are paying for yours and your husbands actions? Yep but in life the things we do sometimes affect our children.\n\nMake no mistake because you waited until after his divorce to be physical you still had an affair.

Do you just lie so much you can't see how obvious you are anymore?", "So the divorce had nothing to do with his feelings towards you and vice versa?

You get that right?", "Thank you. My son is really good, he is at university and thriving. He is a very good kid, has never been in any trouble or caused any issues. His stepmother constantly tries to tell people he is rude and spoilt. My son tries to keep a relationship with his Dad, but it's very limited, and he doesn't support our son in any way..

No one who actually cares about a child would do that to them.", "The husband pursued a relationship outside his marriage. From what interpret from op is that he needs to divorce first if he wants that. That's not a homewrecker.\nIt's the husband who is in the relationship, he is the one that decided to leave and enter a different one.\nI have a hard time believing that OP willingly and with purpose went in to destroy an already existing relationship.\n\nWe tend to blame those outside for the decisions by those inside a relationship", "i must ask, why are the men never called homewreckers? I mean, he is the one that was married after all", "100%", "You\u2019re just the sad lady who is banging his dad. YTA, leave this situation alone for the good of your husband and James.", "He did. Lily and we had shared custody", "And I would bet it's \"wife\"", "A ONS would be purely physical and about ego, an emotional affair would be more relating to you not meeting your partners needs.

Is she hoping to destroy the relationship with James to get him out the picture and keep her husband for her own little family? \n\nI would hope not, as thats vile, but people never cease to amaze", "Jup, 100%.\n\nI will add to say that, OP, you can't force someone to be a part of your family or any type of relationship for that matter. Quite the contrary, it will make them run for the hills even harder and faster. Which is exactly what you're doing by making the demand you are.\n\nJames has indicated, time and time again, that he doesn't want to have anything to do with you or his half siblings. To him, you and them are just a giant reminder of how his world was upended when his dad divorced his mom. I'm taking a wild guess here, but I doubt you've been gracious in your efforts to \"build a relationship\" with him for 2 decades. I'm guessing it has been only on your terms, with little regard for his needs.\n\nAnd you know what, even if you have been gracious and everything anyone could ever hope for in a good step parent, if he rejects you, that's it. End of story. It's his prerogative to decide he doesn't want to be close to you and your family. Sucks for you, but he doesn't owe you anything. It's probably already painful enough to keep in touch with his father.\n\nHave some empathy, take your distance and limit your interactions to politeness. If you're lucky, your relationship with James will stabilize and normalize. But I don't think you can hope for anything more than the situation you're in right now.\n\nI'll be 37 (F) next week. My relationship with both my biological parents is strained at best, no contact at worst, because of how badly they handled their new families vs me.

She lives in a world where it isn't even possible for her to make a mistake.", "Not to mention that it'll hurt her kids too, James doesn't want anything to do with them so she's setting the kids up for rejection regularly. It's just selfishness compounded. This isn't something that she can just sweep under the rug, she can't use her kids as meat shields to interfere with her husband's relationship with his eldest. It's so brutal. Her kids grew up with a full time dad, James didn't. If James didn't resent the situation earlier then he sure as shit would now.", "No, OP said there was nothing physical until the divorce.
