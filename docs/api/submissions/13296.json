{"id": 13296, "submission_id": "123ftxt", "title": "AITA For Asking My Husband to Include Our Children When Spending Time with His Estranged Son?", "selftext": "   I am a 45-year-old woman who has been married to my husband, Fred, for 20 years. We have four children, including my 24-year-old stepson, James. When Fred and I first met, he was still married to James' mother, Lily. We fell in love, but we didn't do anything physical until after their divorce was final.\n   \nI met James when he was five years old, and over the almost 20 years that I have known him, he has never liked me. Despite my best efforts to build a relationship with him, he has never shown any interest in getting to know me or his siblings.\n   \nWhen James turned 18, he left home, and while he would occasionally call and spend time with Fred, he would never do so with me or our children. Recently, I asked Fred to include our children when he spends time with James, but James has not spoken to him since.\n   \nNow, my mother-in-law, who has always favored Lily over me, has called me and accused me of being the AH for hurting James and Fred's relationship \"even further.\"\n  \n I understand that my request may have hurt James' feelings, but after almost two decades of trying to build a relationship with him, I feel that I have exhausted all other options. I love my husband and our children, and I want them to feel included and valued in our family. It's not fair for James to exclude them from his life with Fred simply because he has a strained relationship with me.\n   \nI believe that it's important for families to come together and support one another, especially during difficult times. James is a part of our family, and I want him to know that he is welcome to spend time with us, but not at the expense of my children's feelings or our family dynamic.\n  \n I understand that James may be hurt, but I hope that he can see that our family is important to us, and that we want him to be a part of it.", "created_utc": 1679903919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123ftxt/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_include_our/", "score": 8513, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had an emotional affair with a married man which lead to the break down of his marriage and his son wasn't happy about it?

My son went from spending half his time with his Dad to only going once a month, then when he turned 16, he stopped going all together. This caused his family to grow further apart from his wife. \nThere is probably a reason they prefer his ex! \n\nYou are harming your husbands relationship with his child.

This may not be true, but im sure his dad falling in love with another woman didnt help his first marriage.

He doesnt want a relationship with you because he kept the chip on his shoulder.\n\nAs far as hes concerned, his half siblings are fruits of  that situation which he doesnt care for. You cant force this. \n\nThe most likely scenario? You pressure your husband into taking your kids with him, then James sees them and says nah, have fun with your family and leaves.\n\nThis is not an easy situation for anyone, but you applying pressure for no good reason is giving James a good reason to hate you", "YTA. He's 24, leave him the hell alone.", "Yeah, family is clearly important to you\u2026.

If you think that your marriage to his father makes you a family you are just delusional, you married his father not him, you're not blood related, he owes you nothing, he has every right not to see you and your children as part of his family and it was clear right away about this especially since he knows about you're emotional affair with his dad (you may have even started dating after the divorce but the feelings between you both preceded this and it's because of those feelings that his father left his mother, so in his eyes you are and always will be the one who destroyed his family no matter how hard you try or how nice you are towards him and honestly he has every right to feel that way). The only thing you can do is respect his boundaries and stop with this attitude because it will make you hated even more by him (right now you sounds like the classic step-mom that wants all the attention for her and her kids), If you want your children to spend time with their father, make sure they do it when he's not visiting.\n\nP.S: i'm sorry if i made some grammar mistakes but english is  not my primary language", "Y\n\nT\n\nA", "This was exhausting\u2026 YTA", "YTA\n\nJames knows full well that you\u2019re the reason his father left his mother.

We have four children, including my 24-year-old stepson, James. When Fred and I first met, he was still married to James' mother, Lily. We fell in love, but we didn't do anything physical until after their divorce was final.\n   I met James when he was five years old, and over the almost 20 years that I have known him, he has never liked me. Despite my best efforts to build a relationship with him, he has never shown any interest in getting to know me or his siblings.\n   When James turned 18, he left home, and while he would occasionally call and spend time with Fred, he would never do so with me or our children. Recently, I asked Fred to include our children when he spends time with James, but James has not spoken to him since.\n   Now, my mother-in-law, who has always favored Lily over me, has called me and accused me of being the AH for hurting James and Fred's relationship \"even further.\"\n   I understand that my request may have hurt James' feelings, but after almost two decades of trying to build a relationship with him, I feel that I have exhausted all other options. I love my husband and our children, and I want them to feel included and valued in our family. It's not fair for James to exclude them from his life with Fred simply because he has a strained relationship with me.\n   I believe that it's important for families to come together and support one another, especially during difficult times. James is a part of our family, and I want him to know that he is welcome to spend time with us, but not at the expense of my children's feelings or our family dynamic.\n   I understand that James may be hurt, but I hope that he can see that our family is important to us, and that we want him to be a part of it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He's \"apart of the family\", but \"not at the expense of my children\"??

Is he somehow causing harm or danger to their lives??\n\n>I understand that James may be hurt, but I hope that he can see that our family is important to us, and that we want him to be a part of it.\n\nAgain: OP is making the distinction that James is not actually apart of the family. \"Our family is important to us\" implies the HE should be important to OP, but she clearly makes it about her children, and James is an afterthought.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if James and Fred are still talking/meeting up.

I had a weird gut feeling about their friendship, which I expressed to him, but he reassured me nothing was going on, which I (sort of) believed. When we separated, he moved in with her and as far as I know they're still together. I'm OK with it now, it's been several years and I've gone to therapy to work through what happened, but at the time it was incredibly painful. I was angry and I felt like an idiot for believing him all those months. It made me question almost everything in my relationship with him. For me, it was the prolonged, calculated, intentional betrayal that made it so painful. A one night stand, I could chalk that up to a heat of the moment thing. But MONTHS of lying?! That's intentional, and it stings.\n\nYTA, OP. Not just for this BS emotional affair, but for damaging your sons relationship with his son. Have you stopped to consider how James might be feeling?

It's possible he would have divorced Lily regardless of whether OP was in the picture (or else, wouldn't have divorced her, but their marriage would have continued to degrade over time and become resentful). \n\nThat isn't to say that it's somehow Lily's fault - your relationship being in a bad place is not an excuse for any kind of cheating, and if OP's husband's marriage was failing he should have been working on that, not running around with another woman, physical or no. But I've never seen a cheating situation happen in a healthy relationship where both partners are present for each other. \n\nJust a diff perspective.
