Our mother who has been married to our father for 18 years is finally falling out of love and separating with him. My younger sister believes this is because she is a lesbian. I never understood how my sister got that idea, our mom has never been in a relationship with anyone other than our dad. Definitely not a woman at that. She has never expressed any attraction to a woman nor shown any romantic affection towards her female friends. I think it's pretty obvious that our mom is indeed not a lesbian but my sister refuses to believe that.\nWhen she first spilled the theory she had of our mom being gay I thought she was joking and trolling me, but no. She genuinely thinks our mother is a lesbian and has romantic and sexual attractions to women. The more this debate continued with me and my sister the more she felt hurt that I didn't agree with her. How could I though? She argues with her reasonings being that our mom has never dated anyone other than our dad, but they were highschool sweethearts and my mom moved countries before that so how would she have experience before my dad? I thought our debates about the theory was jokes and debates out of pure boredom. But, my sister continued being so defensive of her idea. It's hard to believe SHE believes this. By the time I started realizing she isn't joking I was getting frustrated by her insistent remarks of this conspiracy and how disrespectful she was being towards my mom and her actual decision to leave our dad. So, earlier this week when she repeated this for the millionth time, I couldn't hold back my laughter alongside a remark of frustration. I straight up told her 'our mom isn't a lesbian'. I didn't know this would hurt her pride so much to the point she stormed out of the living room? I knew it was rude to laugh and interrupt her as she was speaking but seriously, I can't contain it any longer. While she was speaking I couldn't stop thinking about how disrespectful she was being with our mother and her decision, how dumb this whole thing even was, AND how half-assed her reasonings behind her debate was. It genuinely all seemed like a joke, but now, she hasn't talked to me in two days.\nWhen I try talking to her she ignores me completely and when I pick her up from school she doesn't look at my direction of the car.

Mom doesn't love dad anymore is not an easy thing to grasp at that age. Sure it's none of her business and if she really wants to know she should just ask instead of gossiping about it. It sounds like she's not coping so well with how tightly she's holding on to this strange unfounded belief. \n\nMaybe try asking how she's really doing. Be a good big brother.", "NTA. I'm guessing your little sister spends a lot of time on Tumblr though.", "ESH.\n\nWhy don't you kids just ask your mom and settle this once and for all?\n\nAnd how is it disrespectful to your mother if someone thinks she is a lesbian? Are you saying that lesbians deserve less respect compared to other people?", "ESH (as in both you and your sister). Stop gossiping about your mother.", "Does she know the real reason they are divorcing? Could she be trying to gauge how you all would react to a gay family member? \n\nI don't think your an asshole for disagreeing but for laughing makes you a bit of a jerk. Without further information I can't make a solid decision but I'm going to go with YTA but only for laughing at her.", "NAH yet but borderline Y.T.A. for how you're handling this.\n\n1. It sounds like neither you or your sister knows for sure.\n2. Your sister is 14 and having a hard time processing this, and you're laughing at her. Be the bigger person and show her patience and kindness.\n3. You keep saying \"how disrespectful she was being,\" but what's disrespectful about it? There's nothing wrong with being gay if indeed she is.", "I don't know who's the asshole here but this is bizarre lmfao", "I'm going yo withhold judgement. Talk to your mom and ask whether are actually divorcing.\n\nMore than likely your sister is just trying to understand something that she doesn't fully get. Possibly she is lesbian and you are being pretry rude about the idea of your mom being one so your sister feels hurt.\n\nReally this just needs family discussion not the internet.", "ESH. Talk to your parents. Tell them that your sister is having an incredibly hard time dealing with the divorce and probably needs therapy. \n\nYour sister is probably struggling with the fact that two people she loves aren\u2019t good for each other. That\u2019s a hard concept for a lot of people, but especially kids. She is using this as a coping mechanism. You can\u2019t really smash through coping mechanisms, you usually need to ease out of them.", "mmm.. nta. your sister needs to realize that she\u2019s not always right \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd18 the lgbtq is just a figment of her imagination and she should definitely talk to yo momma about it.. #scary\u2026.", "NAH: Talk to your mom together and hopefully she will have an age appropriate explanation for why she is ending the marriage.", "NTA reality sucks", "ESH (except your mother) \n\nThis could be easily settled with a \"Hey mom?\" \n\nAlso maybe consider there's a reason this is so deeply important to her.", "YTA. If your sister is being nonsensical, there\u2019s no sense in trying to argue with her. Engaging is not productive. Just tell her to ask your mom if she\u2019s lesbian FFS.", "Yta\n\nLowkey homophobia", "nta, just stop engaging in this conversation", "NTA. I agree with others that she is most likely trying to rationalize why her parents would divorce, but I do think that since you have clearly shown it bothers you when she postulates your mum is a lesbian that she should stop discussing it with you. You don\u2019t want to have this conversation and she needs to respect that.", "NTA but frankly just leave it at this point. Your sister, for whatever reason, has made up her mind about this and until you guys get an answer or she moves on you're not gonna win this with her but no matter whatever it ends up being she will end up talking to you again on her own time. Perhaps she's projecting and she herself is a lesbian, perhaps she knows more than she's saying, perhaps she seriously misinterpreted something - whatever it is she's dedicated to it. Not trying to be a jerk but as a former 14 year old girl this definitely reads as her reacting just because of the tumult of change happening.", "What were her reasons? You've not given us anything to work with other than how you believe it couldn't be possible.", "NTA but be careful, your unfamiliar-with-complexities-of-relationships sister is probably struggling with why her parents are splitting. Her understanding of love, commitment, and maybe her influence on them is all being rocked", "NTA", "Projection is often a symptom. (/j)", "I feel like op's sister's focus is on mom's sexuality because she can't handle the divorce. She's looking for someone to blame.  And if it's the mom being a lesbian, then it's no one's fault and she can understand it better", "How is this the top voted comment. OP clearly wasn\u2019t pushing any sexuality onto his mum and was just disagreeing with his sister doing so. \nHow on earth does that make him the asshole here.", "Idk if that\u2019s really fair though, is it? It sounds like it\u2019s literally always and only the sister who brings it up. OP at first humored her as they thought it was a joke. \n\nIt also sounds like OP could care less about this and would RATHER not talk or think about it anyways but its the sister who\u2019s so insistent and constantly bringing it up. OP haas been trying to make her stop. \n\nSo I feel your judgement is kind of unfair on OP because you\u2019re implying that he\u2019s the one who\u2019s also always bringing it up and obsessing over it when it\u2019s the exacts opposite. OP came on here to vent about exactly the fact that his lil sister is the one to constantly talk about it\u2026", "Yeah, feel like there is something more to this.", "I think they are saying it\u2019s disrespectful specifically because it somehow undermines moms choice of leaving their father. Notice how every time OP says that she\u2019s disrespecting their mom he specifically also mentions \u201cand her choice/decision\u201d by trying to say their mom is only leaving their dad because she\u2019s gay. \n\nThe sister is probably trying to find a way to explain this entire situation and in her head it\u2019s probably easier to accept her mom actually being gay than to accept the fact that her mom just isn\u2019t in love with her dad anymore. I can see how it\u2019d be easier to accept that your mom still loves your dad but she finally came to terms with being a lesbian so they are divorcing than to just accept the possible fact that they just fell out of love with each other for whatever reason, and it\u2019s easier to think \u201cit\u2019s not just my dad that mom doesn\u2019t want to be with\u2026 she doesn\u2019t want any man\u201d. I believe this is her way of making sense of things while also protecting her own feelings. \n\nHow ever OP sees it differently. They probably don\u2019t realize that lil sis is trying her best to cope and this is her way of dealing with it. OP is also coping with the divorce and all he hears when his sister mentions their mom being a lesbian is that his sister is not respecting or accepting of the simple fact that parents sometimes fall out of love; and that there doesn\u2019t have to be some big underlying reason as to why it happens. \n\nThe way I read this when he mentions his sister not respecting moms decision to divorce dad (again every time OP mention\u2019s disrespecting the mom they ALWAYS right after put \u201cand her CHOICE\u201d) is that OP sees his sister as trying to undermine moms decision to divorce dad by making up a scenario where it can\u2019t be helped on either side for mom and dad because moms actually a lesbian. That way it wouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s fault for why they are divorcing. That way sister can still see her two parents as people who do still love each other but just can\u2019t be with each other and it not really being a choice. \n\nBut like I said OP is also going through this issue and processing everything. Emotions are running very high and the way the two siblings are coping with it is mashing with each other. \n\nI didn\u2019t read anything in OPs post that implied he thought that being a lesbian is actually bad of being called one is disrespectful. I see it as a teenage boy who\u2019s having disagreements with his younger teenage sister during a very difficult time in their lives and he thinks his sisters way of dealing with the situation by claiming their mom is a lesbian is what is disrespectful of their mom\u2019s decision because he personally feels like she\u2019s somehow undermining mom\u2019s decision to leave their father by claiming she must there for be a lesbian.", "There is nothing wrong with being gay. The disrespectful part is her continually speculating on someone else's sexuality behind their backs. A one-off curiosity is fine, but the fact that she keeps bringing up her mother's sexuality in random conversations is absolutely disrespectful.", "It is disrespectful because her mom is going through a whole divorce with their father, and the first way she handles this is by assuming she is a lesbian. I don't get the logic.", "Its not homophobic, its generally rude to assume someones sexuality esp since the mom must be going through a hard time already, likeee? Not everything is homophobia", "Exactly how I read it, well put.", "Exactly, it's rude to assume anyone's sexuality (gay, straight, bi etc) based on no information, especially not from the person themselves. You shouldn't be making up your own ideas about people and projecting it onto them.", "This; it is disrespectful to her mom's choice about the divorce because she could have a thousand other reasons why she's divorcing their dad because it negates both the dad's part in it and her mom's own experience. Not saying he is, but if for instance the dad is a jerk, saying she's a lesbian dismisses that and puts it all on their mom.", "Also op is assuming just as much", "Op makes it sound like her being a lesbian would be a bad thing\n\nThats homophobia", "They aint though? Like im not homophobic and if my little sister kept saying my mom was a lesbian after a divorce i would be upset too. Its annoying and while its not wrong to be gay, having someone like a parent being called something they are not is fustrating. Like id be like \"where tf did u get that idea?\" Also homophobia would be like if the mom turned out to be a lesbian and the son got mad", "He said that saying she is a lesbian is disrespectful\n\nBut fully argued that she is straight\n\n\nThat is a double standard on sexuality \n\nThat is lowkey homophobia", "It is disrespecful to assume someones sexuality is something diffrent from what they have shown. Like if a gay man clearly was gay but had a falling out with his husband...and someone was like \"omg he must be straight and into women now\" doesnt that seem disrespectful asf?", "You are deflecting\nThe issue is OPs homophobic comment\n\nThe sister didn't post an AITA", "??????? \ud83d\ude2d girl okay i aint doing this cause u seem to not understand"]}
