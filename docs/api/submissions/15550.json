She was screaming at you in the street and wants you to apologize to her. Screw that, it's your wedding. If you and your groom don't want her there she shouldn't be there. As for any fallout, that's for other adults to deal with.", "NTA. People need to stop enabling childish behavior like this in adults. Allowing her to still attend would just reinforce that she can behave like a child. It\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure she doesn\u2019t pester her family, and if they back out that\u2019s on them. This is your wedding, don\u2019t let people push you around.", "I mean, she technically uninvited herself! NTA.\nI hope your fianc\u00e9 is ok.", "WTAF???\n\nOf course NTA.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou would never be the AH for making the reasonable choice to uninvite someone that behaved in such a childish manner. It is your wedding day and you should be surrounded by the people that you and your fiance love.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your day.  But maybe talk to her sister first to find out if she\u2019d still go.", "You would NBTA as it is your wedding. I would suggest you talk to your bridesmaid and your family about it to inform them of your decision. It stinks, but are you ok with not having your bridesmaid and the rest of her family attend or is it better to just let the older sister come and ignore her? Hopefully your fiance was ok and whatever the decision you have a wonderful wedding.", "Just say you've decided to have a childfree wedding.  NTA", "NTA. No one needs drama like this. Suggest you talk to your bridesmaid first and advise that you don\u2019t want her sister there and the reasons why. If she hears it first from you, hopefully she will understand and not stop out of the wedding. Actions have consequences and if this woman behaves like this often, nothing will change until people hold her accountable.", "NTA. However in your shoes I would discuss it with your mother. If this will cause tension between your mother and hers, it\u2019s probably not worth it.", "NTA", "Its your wedding, your choice on who to invite. Like wise it is up to individuals to decide if they want to come if the crazy lady is not invited.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe said she wasn\u2019t coming to your wedding. I would simply confirm to her in writing that as she has now RSVPed that she\u2019s not attending, her place has been removed.", "First thing\u2019s first, is your fianc\u00e9 okay and how bad is his injury?\n\nNow to your question.  Your wedding, your choice.  Plus your fianc\u00e9 agrees with you.  Easy answer.\n\nYWNBTA", "Do you want a total meltdown at your wedding by this woman? She sounds unstable.", "NTA. Her family understands that what she did is appalling, I highly doubt they would be pressured into not attending and causing further strain. I don't know why she'd be yelling at you for wanting to leave to check on your fiance, but I guess I don't need to? She is still wrong, lol.\n\nMinimize stress at your wedding. Congratulations!", "NTA A grown woman throwing a temper tantrum like that is pathetic. Uninvite her. The last thing you need or want is that kind of childish drama at your wedding.", "What your mom thinks doesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s your wedding not hers. If you have security at your wedding make sure she isn\u2019t admitted. And since she\u2019s blocked you take someone with you to see her and tell her personally she isn\u2019t welcome. Let the chips fall where they may.. imagine what kind of scene she will pull at your wedding or reception!!", "Her sisters are sick of her behavior too, that's why they apologized for her.", "NTA. Her behavior wasn\u2019t justified and the situation was none of her business.  You were going to check on your injured fianc\u00e9e and that warrants a temper tantrum?  I would be concerned that she would do something at your wedding like this if you don\u2019t apologize sincerely enough.", "NTA.  I was envisioning a twenty year old brat.  Still acting like a toddler at 45!!  This woman is crazy.  If she comes to the wedding, she will drop drama bombs everywhere!!", "NTA - I love it when the trash takes itself out. No further action required. Enjoy your drama-free wedding!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do not invite her, and round up some security so that when she shows up looking to make a scene, she\u2019ll be strongarmed out of there. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I think it needs to be considered that if she acted like this at the bachelorette party, how is she going to act at the wedding?", "When in doubt kick her out.  NTA.", "Those are my thoughts exactly. She\u2019s a 45 year old woman and she NEVER faces consequences for how she treats people and I don\u2019t want to let her win", "Hahaha I love that. Thanks for the laugh.", "He\u2019s ok, he had a bad sprained ankle but it was an ankle that he\u2019s broken in the past so I was worried he\u2019d done some real damage (he probably would have if he wasn\u2019t drunk lol).", "Yeah that\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about too.", "SHE'S 45?!  Omg, you are Sooooo \n\nN T A !!!!", "Make sure your mum conveys to her that her attending your wedding would NOT be supporting your parents. That woman disrespected you and has a tendency to cause a scene. \n\nPerhaps your mum and her sisters can convince her not to attend because things between you are too tense. I think I would try that first and then resort to uninviting her. At least give the sister who is your bridesmaid a heads up first so you can determine whether you need to replace her or have a backup.", "Admirable, but be careful. Those are the types that go nuclear and blow everything to bits.", "I was shocked at her age.", "Which is what I\u2019m afraid of", "if u uninvite which i think u shud do....have someone guard the door in case she still shows up and wants to make a scene.  get some security in case.", "Look into hiring security for the event. When I've looked into it it's been more affordable than I expected. It's not *cheap* but possibly a few hundred dollars for peace of mind on a wedding day."]}
