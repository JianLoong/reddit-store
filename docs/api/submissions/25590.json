All he had to do was keep his dog on a leash and this wouldn't have happened.", "NTA - their dog was out of control and your dog was defending itself. It's an unfortunate situation, but not your fault. If your friendship/happy neighbor relation is really at jeopardy and important to you, I suppose you could make a token gesture, but not doing so doesn't make you TA. Some dogs end up leash aggressive when attacked like yours was, even though they look uninjured.  I hope everyone heals up well.", "NTA - His inability to control his dog, not use a leash, and it attacked inside your garage equals: Not your bill to pay. Infact, there's no indication the neighbor asked you to.", "NTA. The question is how much would you be willing to pay in a good neighbor tax.", "NTA. It wasn't your fault this happened. Your dogs were leashed as they should be and defended themselves from his dog that wasn't leashed. The fault is entirely on your neighbor and the bill should ONLY be covered by him because this could've been prevented if he too had his dog leashed like you did.", "NTA. I agree with you.", "NTA. The neighbors dog fucked around and found out. You owe them nothing.", "NTA at all. I get the good neighbor thing, but depending on how well you know this person, I\u2019d just be worried that he\u2019ll keep taking it further and eventually you giving him money could be construed as admission of guilt", "NTA.  He failed to control his dog, which resulted in his dog getting injured. He's absurdly entitled to ask for you to pay him because his dog attacked yours.  Your dog protected himself and his family.  You could sue your neighbor for emotional distress.  \n\nI would file a police report just to have a record of the event.  This neighbor sounds a bit unhinged.", "NTA it was an unfortunate accident", "Nta ur dog was on a lead his wasn't", "NTA.  His dog was not leashed. Yours were. His dog attacked.  Your dog defended.

Only if you feel comfortable, if you know he wouldn\u2019t do the same, then just leave it. Shit/accidents happens. People aren\u2019t perfect & yes, as much as people like to admit that they are the BEST pet owner, we all make mistakes. \n\nBut again, it\u2019s not your fault, you did everything in the moment as correct as possible therefore there is no requirement for you to financially contribute.
