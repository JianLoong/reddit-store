This ruins many childhoods and sometimes means those kids who had to be parents don't even want kids of their own. Leave right now before your sanity is lost, your parents sound selfish and don't understand what it means to be a parent. NTA", "NTA and I think you need to have a serious conversation with your parents about what their plan is when you eventually move out. You\u2019re 19 and starting to have a life separate from your current home and if the relationship your in now goes anywhere serious then it\u2019s possible you may move out in a year or two. You can\u2019t be with your sister all the time and give her the attention that she currently expects and relies on. Without some sort of exit strategy in place for the support she needs when you\u2019re not available, this just sounds like the set up for a bad situation.", "NTA. You sare a room, BUT obviosly you need some privacity aswell. \nThey are the ones Who are been selfish.\nTell your parents how they Will feell if they have a person with them 24/7. \nEven in they're room. \nA courtain its the minimun. \nIn your position I Will reconsider move out. \nYour sister need grow Up and learn that everyone need space and even if she as problems she is not the center of the universe.", "NTA you\u2019re still in the same room as her you just have a divider for privacy", "NTA but you knew that. Your sister sounds like she is manipulating the situation, too. That makes it very rough.", "OP NTA. At 19, she deserves her own space and she is in college. She really needs her own room. Convert basement or attic space.", "NTA, i\u2019ve suffered from depression and SH for a while, and i never wanted attention from people. Anyways, while caring for her is good the first priority is your own mental health, and if her not giving you personal space impacts it then that\u2019s a problem", "NTA but you know that. You need to move out. Your sisters mental health is not your responsibility especially if it comes at the cost of your own. If she needs constant supervision one of your parents should be sharing a room with her. You are not her parent, her therapist or her doctor. \n\nBeyond that, YOU deserve space, and support.", "NTA- NO, your sister needs to learn how to be on her own. You aren't her keeper and you should not have to be her support person like this.  You need some time on your own and privacy, her needs to do not get to override yours.  She can go share with your parents if they push this issues.", "NTA Ar all", "NTA but your parents sure are. You should never have been made to be your sister\u2019s support person. They\u2019re in for a rude awakening when you move out and they have to actually parent their child.", "NTA\n\nTell her it's the curtain or you are moving out, she can decide which she prefers.", "It depends upon whose side you placed the curtain.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
