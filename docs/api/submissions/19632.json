Kids in their 'terrible twos' have trouble managing their emotions (like your sister) but still eventually learn that their tantrums won't get them anywhere - IF the parents are consistent about upholding boundaries. Sometimes the kids' behavior gets worse before it gets better, but it only gets better by the parent holding the line.\n\nThe extra challenge you have is that your parents (for their own convenience) support your sister's view that you are her emotional support animal. Why? Because that (1) relieves them of the burden of having to deal with sister and (2) makes you the easy scapegoat for any conflict. They don't have to care about you and whether something is right or wrong for you. That is why your parents pretend that your role as a sibling is to take on their parental responsibilities. Well almost. Their parental responsibility was to help your sister learn to deal with her challenges and her emotions. They don't care of sister ever learns to take care of herself because they put you in charge of doing that for her... FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Great alliance the three of them have!\n\nYou can try the same upholding your boundaries with your parents. They might be trainable. But their role as 'the parents' makes it a lot harder for you. You may have to decide if you can possible find a way to live somewhere else - but I realize that may be very tricky if they are paying for some of your college education. I suggest you keep preparing yourself for when and how you extricate yourself from this role in your family and from living with the three of them. That way you will be as close to prepared for that as you can be when you decide it's time to cut them off and be free to truly build your own life. Good wishes to you!", "OP may not be in a position to get out now, but she should have a plan to apply for jobs in a conveniently distant city after graduation.", "This isnt true. Im probably also on the extreme spectrum of more mentally ill. I have PTSD, DID, OCD, Autism, etc. \n\nIts hard. We absolutely do need more support and help than regular or avrage people but what she wants is unreasonable and selfish. She has a reason to want what she wants and a reason for why she acts the way she does but thats not a free pass to cross other peoples boundaries over and over with no consequences. \n\nShe needs to let you habe at least some space. Her mental illness doesn't excuse her not giving it to you. Its a need not a want and she needs to respect and understand that mentally ill or not.", "Here you go. It\u2019s not mutually exclusive and this might even be a form of parentification from the parentals. This is how you drive your kids away. It still won\u2019t be selfish it will be for your own mental health. NTA", "nah you're not, it's one of those acronyms that is used incredibly often by people in the community (so to speak) but if you've never done it or spent time in support groups or whatever why would you know it?", "Probably because they want to dump her on OP.", "NTA\n\nTime to move out asap", "Nta what is sh?", "Ah so she\u2019s learned to weaponise the mental health card and has got away with it. Get out asap OP before you end up full time carer", "Pete Davidson has a really great quote about this. \u201cJust because you\u2019re mentally ill doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to be a jackass.\u201d NTA.", "Probably move one of the younger siblings into the bedroom as the new ESA ...", "NTA, this is a fantastic solution. My sibling and I split our room with a bedsheet we tacked up and a strip of masking tape where the sheet didn\u2019t reach. Space is important.", "nta and I think you need to stick to your guns now before this gets in worse, how long do you have  to live with your sister before you can get your own place or move in with your partner, what about making plans for vacations or are you not allowed to travel to far for spring break because your sister might want you home. You are entitled to privacy, you are entitled to time for yourself and if your parents and sister keep pushing you will end up resenting them both. Eventually you'll reach a breaking point and go no or low contact with them; set your boundaries now and if they refuse to listen or respect those boundaries then assuming you can afford it, move out.", "NTA... Privacy is a natural human NEED. Your parent are being unreasonable.  If they think humans dont need privacy, they should move her into their bedroom. \nThey are sacrificing your needs to fulfill hers because they are doing lazy parenting", "NTA, what sadden me the most is your lack of privacy, it's not normal at your age to share a room, I mean how can you do your own secret stuff without anyone looking.\n\nYour parents are in the wrong, they should share their room with her if they want someone to do it, then maybe they will understand that's a horrible idea", "i don\u2019t\u2026 only in the bathroom or at my partners house \ud83d\udc80 or if my sister has gone to school and i have the day off", "NTA your parents need to handle this.", "NTA", "NTA. As harsh as it may seem, it is not your responsibility to care for you sister, let alone 24/7. You are only 17 years old, and your parents should know better. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting privacy.", "You're mental health will suffer if you don't carve out a space for yourself.\n\nMoving out is likely the only solution sadly since your parents are coddling your sister.", "That's insane, you have the right to have your own privacy, with or without a good reason it doesn't matter\n\nI put a big Ikea shelf in front of my door because the idea that someone enter my room whenever they want and can see me even if I'm just on my computer or playing games irritates me in a way I can't describe, when family ask why I hid like that (insinuating that I probably pleasure myself) it's none of their business, I don't care because it actually give peace to my mind to not feel watched"]}
