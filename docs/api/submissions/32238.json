Your fiance clearly doesn't read fiction for fun. That's fine, but her severe disapproval of it is odd. Most passionate readers love fiction, and that skill is nurtured by allowing the young reader to explore whatever books they wish. No one will grow to enjoy something if they are only allowed to participate according to someone else's taste.\n\n Ask her fiance if she thinks niece should stop eating green beans because Brussel Sprouts are clearly healthier?  This is exactly the weird stance shes taken on reading.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is extremely controlling over her niece's reading material. She's going to drive her away from reading altogether or her niece will start sneaking books to read. \n\nAsk your fianc\u00e9e which option does she want?", "NTA\n\nI agree that all reading is good reading. \n\nBut maybe before y'all tie the knot you should discuss how you wanna raise any kids you plan to have together. Cos it doesn't sound like you are on the same page at the moment.", "NTA. Unless a young person disappears down an absolute rabbithole of muck and violence, all reading is good reading. I think your fianc\u00e9es approach might prove counter productive. I would caution against getting too involved in parenting issues in general. She is your fianc\u00e9e's niece, after all.", "NTA. Fianc\u00e9 needs to lighten up. I\u2019m in my mid-30s raising a 15 yo daughter and I\u2019ve had custody of my 13 yo niece since she was 3. I *love* Harry Potter and encourage my kids to get lost in it. I also allow my fianc\u00e9 to fully engage in parenting my niece alongside me, because it\u2019s *our* home and these are now *our* kids.", "Aita for thinking you shouldn\u2019t marry her?

And my parents didn\u2019t care what I read, so long as it was age-appropriate. I grew up on Peanuts compilations and R.L. Stine. \n\nNow? I\u2019m an editor. I loved reading so much I made it my job. I majored in English and exulted in classics (which I read as a teen, too, knowing what direction I wanted my life to take). Reading for fun leads to reading because you\u2019ve found that learning is fun.

And the way to keep a child or teen reading is to let them read books they enjoy", "nta, your fiance lacks maturity", "NTA you didn't step in / overstep at all you just said she could read your book. Your fiance is being way too controlling as well, like let her read what she wants... Sounds like you are advocating for her best interests. I am 30 and Harry Potter is my favourite book series.", "This doesn't seem appropriate.... Why is she so controlling!? Doesn't seem as tho she views you as her life partner", "NTA. I'm in my 50's and I like YA books, especially one that are really well written and tell an awesome story.  But I also read poorly written, derivitive tripe sometimes, and that's also ok.   I'm concerned that your fiance has some unrealistic expectations around your niece and what she might achieve. What's going to happen if your niece decides that she likes art or music or another subject that is not based in STEM? My husband and I are both have science degrees, and I'm a working scientist. A lot of of my colleagues push their children towards STEM, and that's ok, until it becomes the only acceptable option.  Your niece needs to be able to explore her interests in a supportive environment, and as an adult in her life, it's your job to make sure she gets the chance to do it. If your fiance is telling you that you don't have any say in the decisions around your niece, this is an even bigger problem.  You need to sit down with her and have her lay out exactly what she expects of you in regards to your role in your niece's life.  Her correct attitude is concerning, especially if it's not something she has expressed to you before.", "NTA. If the conversation you wrote is accurate, she's raving. I'm sorry.", "Erm... NTA. Niece is living with you. Asking you to keep Niece away from your books is a bit much. Does your fianc\u00e9 own the house you live in? Because unless it is theirs, I don't see how it is reasonable to ask you to keep your stuff out of the way.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 can decide what is appropriate for the Niece to read. That decision does not involve you. Asking you to enforce her rules, though, would. Then you would be entitled to an opinion. If your fianc\u00e9 doesn't want the Niece reading Harry Potter, get them to take it up with her directly. You answered a simple question accurately - that you don't mind her borrowing your books.\n\nThis may be how your fianc\u00e9 will treat parenting, though. Not wanting your input when you might raise your own in future feels like a red flag to me.", "NTA. All reading is good.  If you run a reading level test on the Harry Potter books, you\u2019ll discover that they are written at a grade 11 / level. I actually did the test when the books came out while I was teaching school.  Maybe give your fianc\u00e9 something really good to read so she will understand the magic that most fiction books I have inside their covers.  Good luck!", "NTA you\u2019re never too old to read Harry Potter what nonsense", "Do. Not. Marry. This. Woman.", "NTA - Your fiancee is extremely controlling towards your niece. And her comment regarding decisions about her is condescending.  For craps, sake, you are engaged to be married, and you will be a parental figure in this girl's life. Your fiancee is utterly disrespecting you here, and may be teaching her niece to do the same. If this has been a pattern of hers, please further discuss what your future marriage will look like.

In 2 years and a bit, your niece won't have to do anything your fiancee says and she's going to LOSE HER SHIT based on what you've written here. If your future wife doesn't like orange, is your niece forbidden from wearing it too? The kid's got to be able to express herself, and how she's going to want to do that is going to vary widely in the next 3-5 years. Fiancee can't make those decisions for the girl, as much as she wants to.
