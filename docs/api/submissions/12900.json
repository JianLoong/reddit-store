I made the decision to drop out of college and work at my family\u2019s business. Thankfully we remained busy with work, and I was able to provide for my gf as well as my newborn son. I spent the better part of that year working 12 hour days 7 days of the week saving up for our upcoming expenses. Her mother and I came to an agreement that it would be best if I lived with my gf\u2019s family because she had a spare room. Of course I paid my fair share of the rent and I tried to explain that it would be best if I bought my own food for my gf and I. Because of my upbringing I\u2019m no stranger to living under someone else\u2019s roof so I tend to be as considerate as possible.  \n\nA couple of weeks into living with her family I began to notice how her siblings (f20 and m16 at the time) treated my gf. My gf was the backbone of her family, her dad was an absentee drunk and my gf was forced to grow up fast and sacrifice her childhood to raise her siblings while her mother worked. I financially supported her the best I could for a year and a half because we agreed it would be best for our son for her not to work yet. Her mother changed her attitude towards our son as soon as he was born, but whenever I asked if she could watch him she would say yes, and when I came back she would be gone. Her siblings on the other hand would leave a mess behind and expect my gf to clean up after them as if they were toddlers themselves. What really got to me was the fact that they would eat our groceries. I would see the same glass of our milk left out on the dinner table for DAYS. Her sister f20 at the time had TWO jobs and would buy all the shoes/clothes and electronics she wanted. She would show it off to my gf who has now been more than a year dependent on me to pull her through financially, but her sister still wouldn\u2019t buy her own groceries. \n\nMy gf\u2019s mother would be gone 2 months at a time and her grown kids became our expense. Nothing was compensated, not even an apology. They were of no help to us at all through the upbringing of my son despite the fact we lived under the same roof for a year and a half. Matter of fact they would openly mock eating our food right in Our faces. They would also scratch my car, and I even suspect it was them that put a nail on 3 of my tires in the SAME WEEK. On some instances I\u2019ve heard them call me names behind my back. My gf breaks down crying remembering that episode in our lives and apologizes on their behalf but that\u2019s not what I want. We moved out and got our own place. What I want from her family is to stay away from my son. I never once limited my gf\u2019s time with her family but this thread doesn\u2019t do Justice to the BS my gf and I endured for more than a year. My gf would like to take my son over to her mom\u2019s house, but I don\u2019t let her because of what happened AITA?", "created_utc": 1679470350, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yawig/aita_for_not_letting_my_gf_f24_take_my_son_to_her/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can you convince her to get some therapy?", "NTA. \n\nHer family doesn't deserve to know your son. Especially her mother. Agreeing to babysit and then taking off. That would be the end for me.

You are 100% right not wanting your son around her family. I understand how she feels and maybe some kind of therapy will help for her to see that. Remember that she grew up in that terrible environment and somehow that\u2019s sort of \u201cnormal\u201d for her.

She\u2019s witnessed it first hand", "Thank you for responding. We do communicate. Her and I are happy together, but her family is just so out there. They are so lazy they are considering giving up their dog because they can\u2019t change their ways. I tell her if that\u2019s so? Then how could I ever have peace of mind when my son is over there? when they don\u2019t even care about their own dog let alone their sister.", "The gf (child's mother) will be there too. The baby will be fine there.", "My gf wants to visit her mother with my son, she recognizes that our son can\u2019t be there alone because they can\u2019t watch him properly. There is so much left unsaid because of the character limit. But let me put it this way. They are trying to get rid of their dog (husky) because they\u2019re too lazy to take care of it. How can I have peace of mind when that\u2019s the kind of people my first born son is around? At the very least they are a bad influence for him", "The gf wants to visit her mother with the baby. They are not on the same side of the debate.", "What do you mean? I literally stated that I don\u2019t limit HER time with her family. I just don\u2019t want my son there because they are bad influences. Can you elaborate?", "What you described suggests they would be negligent. Please do not endanger your child by allowing her to take him there. If she says they have changed, then maybe down the line - *when you child is old enough to communicate how they feel and what is happening to them* - then maybe you could meet up at a cafe or some neutral place to introduce them. \n\nIt is so important that you do not expose your small child to people and situations that you know are not in their best interest. \n\nAll that matters is what is best for your child - not brothers and sisters and parents and their feelings. \n\nBut most importantly - wait until your child is old enough to speak for themselves and communicate verbally. And only with you present. \n\nYour wife unfortunately cannot be trusted to supervise visits. Even if she is in agreement now - sadly, she is the bottom of the totem pole. She has become accustomed to being bossed around and not having any agency with her own family. \n\nKeep on being a great dad and husband! \n\nNTA", "If they still have the dog over there when your son is going I'd def not let the son go over there, if they are too lazy to take care of it, they are too lazy to train it and would indanger your child, that and they've caused a lot of pain to you and your GF so definately not the greatest idea to go there, prehaps bring up the option of of inviting the GF's mother to your place to visit, but that'd be it, I wouldn't let a child around that family, especially if there is an u trained and UNWALKED dog, a dog with pent up energy will 100% be aggressive, especially to u familiar strangers, as a dog owner myself and seeing how friends and neighbours not treated their doggos right but the dog situation definately changes everything\n\n*edit: I hope that dog gets adopted into a new and loving home, doggo deserves WAY better", "Have not read that the gf absolutely does nothing about her family's behaviour and lets them walk all over her?", "The reason why I'm not very hopeful about the GF's mother being present/helpful with the situation if they were to visit the GF's family house is the GF's mother has been absent, she has no experience how to handle children! Idk how old the small child is but she wouldn't be much help, maybe some, but not much, and we don't know how she will react in the conflict, would she side with the horrid GF's siblings? Or would she side with OP and GF? It is uncertain so it's safer to go about it in another way, as I've suggested in replies", "I'm going to go with NAH. I get where you're coming from and want to look out for your son. Your gf clearly has a very unhealthy relationship with her family but it is still her family and it is also her son. If you trust your  gf to be a good mother then you should trust that she will keep your son safe when she takes your son with to visit her family. It's not a great environment and I would be concerned too. But you're putting her in a very tough position here. I feel this is above reddit's pay grade... There is a lot to unpack here and as you've mentioned, there is a lot more to all of this. This is something the 2 of you need to figure out. She needs to hear you out and take your concerns into account. Family is very tricky.", "If ever she leaves your son with her family, ask if she wants your son to be treated the same way they treat her.", "The comment above mine from OP: \n\nWe do talk.. and unfortunately she understands and is okay with that decision. She\u2019s witnessed it first hand\n\nMaybe I misunderstood, it\u2019s worded strangely \ud83d\ude48", "Your \"my son\" all the time is so annoying. You also did this all the time in the posting, even in the title. It is the son of you both, he isn't just YOUR son. You must start seeing him as \"our\" is you want this to work. She is the mother and have the same rights as you. You must try to find compromises.", "Because by forbidding her son, you are putting a strain on her. She will choose to go less so that she doesn't have to keep explaining herself. It's so controlling. Fair enough if you don't want him by himself there but he would be there with someone you're supposed to trust.", "Honestly I never even thought about this. Thank you, I just saw it from the perspective of how they were to us and my son. I mean it can\u2019t get anymore shallow than that", "This person I was replying to said the baby was in serious danger there. How does her letting her family walk all over her.. and, seemingly, not tidying up if she's living there put a baby in serious danger?", "I'm pretty sure he doesn't mean that she's fine with the decision not to allow the child around her family, as its literally the point of the post:\n\n> My gf would like to take my son over to her mom\u2019s house, but I don\u2019t let her because of what happened AITA?", "I understand that. Thank you. But what if I tell you she recognizes this too? That her family has never been good to her or her son? I mean that\u2019s our first born and as a parent you gotta look out for your own children", "No problem, I wish you luck and hope it all works out with your family :)", "The reason I believed the child would be in serious danger is that the siblings especially have shown to have little to no care for things, since I made that when I didn't know about the dog (which 100% makes that place unsafe for the small child) they have damaged the OP's property, the car, etc, and they are showing such horrid behaviours, if things escalated in an arguement, it's not too far fetched to see the siblings of the OP's GF to get violent or potentially put the small child in physcial danger either intentially or accidently, but it would happen, or they'd at least make the small child distressed by causing the GF or the OP feeling tense, tiny humans are very perceptive and pick up on people's emotions, especially their parents, the visit would not be good for that small child, as I suggested to OP maybe the GF's mother could visit OP and GF at their current residence but not at GF'S family's residence, if this makes sense?", "Yeah I see your point. My bad.", "I completely understand your worries, I am also a parent and want to protect my kids from bad influences. However, we cannot always protect them from these kinds of people. At least in this environment it is safer for him because he has his mother (you too, if you visit with her).\n\nYou tell me she recognises this? That's great because it means even more she can cut the shit if she needs to. I know it's hard, take a deep breath and try it. You never know. Maybe she takes him and it is a disaster and she decides she doesn't want to anymore. You get what you want with it being her choice and not her feeling you put this impossible choice on her.", "They're untidy, ate food he bought, and they scratched his car (he didn't even say they intentionally vandalised it, he just suspects that they may have been behind getting nails in his tyres). They sound annoying, but not dangerous.\n\n>if things escalated in an arguement, it's not too far fetched to see the siblings of the OP's GF to get violent or potentially put the small child in physcial danger either intentially or accidently, but it would happen\n\nThere is no discussion of violence at all in the post, so it seems like a pretty major jump without any basis for it. She's not leaving her baby alone with them. Most people stay with their baby during a visit to their family home.", "She recognizes this but my gf isn\u2019t confrontational or willing to put an end to it. She\u2019s shown that to me in the past. There is so much left unsaid because of the character limit but I have my reasons for not visiting them either. They\u2019d love to come over but she doesn\u2019t even let them she\u2019d rather meet them somewhere. For the amount of work she put in for them they never reciprocated that", "INFO: why the fuck are you calling you and your girlfriend's son \"my son\"? It's very confusing the entire time... He's her son too??? Biologically???", ">My gf would like to take my son over to her mom\u2019s house, but I don\u2019t let her because of what happened.\n\nIt does not sound safe for your son to be on that property so I think NTA.", "Wtf does your gf want to go to see people who are that so terrible in the 1st place. You got her out why go back NTA", "NTA, but she's not just your girlfriend, she's the child's mother. And you keep referring to \"my son\" why not \"our son\"??\n\nIf you didn't mention her getting pregnant, the whole story reads like you're a single dad and you have a new gf. Language is important.", "Agreed. I wonder why gf is looking to be part of a family, considering OP talks like the kid isn't even hers.", "Then invite MIL to your house. She will probably be to lazy to come over but at least your trying.\n\nAnd you can conveniently be home in the garage. Quietly supervising."]}
