I made the decision to drop out of college and work at my family\u2019s business. Thankfully we remained busy with work, and I was able to provide for my gf as well as my newborn son. I spent the better part of that year working 12 hour days 7 days of the week saving up for our upcoming expenses.

Of course I paid my fair share of the rent and I tried to explain that it would be best if I bought my own food for my gf and I. Because of my upbringing I\u2019m no stranger to living under someone else\u2019s roof so I tend to be as considerate as possible.  \n\nA couple of weeks into living with her family I began to notice how her siblings (f20 and m16 at the time) treated my gf. My gf was the backbone of her family, her dad was an absentee drunk and my gf was forced to grow up fast and sacrifice her childhood to raise her siblings while her mother worked. I financially supported her the best I could for a year and a half because we agreed it would be best for our son for her not to work yet. Her mother changed her attitude towards our son as soon as he was born, but whenever I asked if she could watch him she would say yes, and when I came back she would be gone. Her siblings on the other hand would leave a mess behind and expect my gf to clean up after them as if they were toddlers themselves. What really got to me was the fact that they would eat our groceries. I would see the same glass of our milk left out on the dinner table for DAYS. Her sister f20 at the time had TWO jobs and would buy all the shoes/clothes and electronics she wanted.

There is so much left unsaid because of the character limit. But let me put it this way. They are trying to get rid of their dog (husky) because they\u2019re too lazy to take care of it.

Idk how old the small child is but she wouldn't be much help, maybe some, but not much, and we don't know how she will react in the conflict, would she side with the horrid GF's siblings?

I get where you're coming from and want to look out for your son. Your gf clearly has a very unhealthy relationship with her family but it is still her family and it is also her son. If you trust your  gf to be a good mother then you should trust that she will keep your son safe when she takes your son with to visit her family. It's not a great environment and I would be concerned too. But you're putting her in a very tough position here. I feel this is above reddit's pay grade... There is a lot to unpack here and as you've mentioned, there is a lot more to all of this. This is something the 2 of you need to figure out. She needs to hear you out and take your concerns into account.

She is the mother and have the same rights as you. You must try to find compromises.", "Because by forbidding her son, you are putting a strain on her.

Thank you. But what if I tell you she recognizes this too? That her family has never been good to her or her son? I mean that\u2019s our first born and as a parent you gotta look out for your own children", "No problem, I wish you luck and hope it all works out with your family :)", "The reason I believed the child would be in serious danger is that the siblings especially have shown to have little to no care for things, since I made that when I didn't know about the dog (which 100% makes that place unsafe for the small child) they have damaged the OP's property, the car, etc, and they are showing such horrid behaviours, if things escalated in an arguement, it's not too far fetched to see the siblings of the OP's GF to get violent or potentially put the small child in physcial danger either intentially or accidently, but it would happen, or they'd at least make the small child distressed by causing the GF or the OP feeling tense, tiny humans are very perceptive and pick up on people's emotions, especially their parents, the visit would not be good for that small child, as I suggested to OP maybe the GF's mother could visit OP and GF at their current residence but not at GF'S family's residence, if this makes sense?", "Yeah I see your point. My bad.", "I completely understand your worries, I am also a parent and want to protect my kids from bad influences. However, we cannot always protect them from these kinds of people. At least in this environment it is safer for him because he has his mother (you too, if you visit with her).\n\nYou tell me she recognises this? That's great because it means even more she can cut the shit if she needs to. I know it's hard, take a deep breath and try it. You never know. Maybe she takes him and it is a disaster and she decides she doesn't want to anymore. You get what you want with it being her choice and not her feeling you put this impossible choice on her.", "They're untidy, ate food he bought, and they scratched his car (he didn't even say they intentionally vandalised it, he just suspects that they may have been behind getting nails in his tyres). They sound annoying, but not dangerous.\n\n>if things escalated in an arguement, it's not too far fetched to see the siblings of the OP's GF to get violent or potentially put the small child in physcial danger either intentially or accidently, but it would happen\n\nThere is no discussion of violence at all in the post, so it seems like a pretty major jump without any basis for it. She's not leaving her baby alone with them. Most people stay with their baby during a visit to their family home.", "She recognizes this but my gf isn\u2019t confrontational or willing to put an end to it. She\u2019s shown that to me in the past. There is so much left unsaid because of the character limit but I have my reasons for not visiting them either. They\u2019d love to come over but she doesn\u2019t even let them she\u2019d rather meet them somewhere.

You got her out why go back NTA", "NTA, but she's not just your girlfriend, she's the child's mother. And you keep referring to \"my son\" why not \"our son\"??\n\nIf you didn't mention her getting pregnant, the whole story reads like you're a single dad and you have a new gf. Language is important.", "Agreed. I wonder why gf is looking to be part of a family, considering OP talks like the kid isn't even hers.", "Then invite MIL to your house. She will probably be to lazy to come over but at least your trying.\n\nAnd you can conveniently be home in the garage. Quietly supervising.", "Sorry for the lack of context I think some more is warranted. My gf completely raised her younger brother because her mom had to work to get them by. She clothed, fed, and watched after her sister as well. They are all 4 years apart. My gf got a job in HS to help pay for things as well as feed them. The moment my gf didn\u2019t have a job they couldn\u2019t even help her out. Not monetarily, not with our son, not in any way, shape, or form. Instead they looked for her to solve every single one of their issues even her own mom.  See, my gf is the kindest person their is and \u2018no\u2019 isn\u2019t in her vocabulary when it comes to her family. They quite frankly, took advantage of that. On top of that her mom would talk sh!T about my family. The only people who REALLY helped my gf, myself, and our son. Despite all this there were times she ignored my concerns because she didn\u2019t want to believe her family was this way. Not even if the evidence was presented in a silver platter. Besides getting in our way we got our own place. And get this, she helps pay for her mom\u2019s mortgage as well as our own. Why? I\u2019m not sure. I think they have no shame asking so much of my gf and not reciprocating that in return. She now apologizes for not doing or saying anything when it all went down. That\u2019s all behind us now, what matters is that we got out. But now they want to come over and have my son visit often, and I have a problem with that because of the aforementioned issues we had with them.", "NTA", "NTA your girlfriend was raised in a neglectful and abusive household. Parentification is a major stress and can cause ongoing problems. I'm really glad she has you to take care of her. Try to encourage her to seek therapy.", "NTA - Record everything your girlfriend says about her mother and siblings without her seeing it, allow small visits for a while as long as you go along, and discreetly record everything that happens in that house, it will help you a lot in a future custody fight .  Record everything they say about you behind your back, hiding if you can.  Because if this marriage ends, for obvious reasons, you can see what environment your son will be raised in and what kind of treatment he will receive, and that his wife will be silent in the face of all the abuse.", "NTA \n\nYour son shouldn't be around them at all.

My gf would get everything done for them. She was the glue that held the family together. And they\u2019re severely dependent on her. So much so they only call to ask her for something. She loves them to death, but I just feel like it\u2019s not reciprocated based on what happened.

This thread hasn\u2019t gone in 100% what they\u2019ve done. Keep in mind it\u2019s been 1.5 years of BS I had to tolerate.  She realizes NOW back then she didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why she has no problem with this decision because she knows what her family has done", "She\u2019s a strong woman. Honestly stronger than myself.

I said if she\u2019s fine with being walked all over then that\u2019s her problem but don\u2019t make our son the same way because quite frankly her family but money in front of our well being. Her family put money in front of my son\u2019s well being and it doesn\u2019t sit well with me. That\u2019s why I limit their visitation", "I think maybe you should stay.  Leaving only incentivizes their bad behaviour, but more importantly, there is a legitimate reason to feel anxious about baby's safety in their presence.  Your GF could step away for a minute to use the bathroom and tragedy strike.\n\nNot saying they are homicidal, but clearly, they have serious issues and the baby separated them from their packmule/payday sister.  I would only trust them after some time and A LOT of evidence that they are getting healthier.\n\nI might be a silly, judgemental old lady on the internet and if you disagree with me, that's perfectly okay.  But maybe pause and consider the possibility that I am not entirely wrong.\n\nGreat book for you to read is \"The Gift of Fear\", by Gavin de Becker.  Lots of \"learn to trust your gut\" advice.", "Correct", "Thank you, this is what I told my wife. I let her know that maybe things could change in the future, but for now this happened not too long ago and I prefer to keep my distance", "Bingo! She has 0 experience handling small children and would even talk to my son as if he were mentally challenged. But as to the violence I seriously doubt it. They\u2019re kind people for the most part.", "I did it to be the bigger person, so my gf can have her time to herself with her family. I don\u2019t want to 100% keep him away. I understand that\u2019s his family regardless and he goes over once a month supervised by his mom. But unfortunately you\u2019re right by himself he isn\u2019t safe there no one there has experience with a small child not even my gf mom", "I really appreciate your comment. Thank you", "He\u2019s my son because I have and will always have his best interest in mind. Even if his own mother doesn\u2019t. Like I\u2019ve stated what her and her family let happened was a lot to take in. And not even all of it could be mentioned because of the character limit. And if we have to separate over this issue then so be it. I will always look after my son", "Sorry it was 3 am and I was sleepy lol but what I meant is ultimately she\u2019s fine with the decision because she saw this first hand as well. But she wishes he could go over often if the situation were different", "Sorry my fault. Ultimately we agreed that once a month is fine. She would like to take him over more often, but she realizes what they\u2019ve done and how they are so she doesn\u2019t take him over.", "NTA, Protect your kid, try getting gf into therapy for those family issues, she needs more boundaries with them. She should not feel responsible for their actions.", "NTA. That would be a terrible environment for your son. Your GF isn't an AH for having trouble disentangling herself from toxic family. The AHs here are her fully grown adult family members who took advantage of you both.", "NTA.  Sounds like I wouldn't let my kid within 10ft. of these people.", "NTA. I have family members that I've kept from my kids. I just don't trust them. If I can't trust you around my kids, you don't get access to my kids. Period.", "NTA gf needs some help realising how toxic her childhood was", "NTA. It\u2019s hard as it\u2019s her family but maybe over time she\u2019ll see how dysfunctional they are.", "OP, consider going to therapy TOGETHER with your GF. Tell her there are things outside of her family you'd like to discuss, along with her family, so you can be the best parents you can to your child. Start out literally talking about this. Discuss your own background. Ask for recommendations on books and programs to better parent your child. Slowly weave in things with the therapist about her family, get the therapist's feedback. Let your GF talk more and more. When your GF is ready, REALLY get into it. Sometimes it takes a long time to work these things out. I know people who went to therapy for anxiety and came out learning about boundaries with their family. It's a process.", "I lived there because I couldn\u2019t bring my son anywhere else until I saved to buy a house. Just because I lived with them doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to let them walk all over me or my son. There\u2019s a difference between not knowing you\u2019re doing messed up things vs willingly and mocking about it. Which is what they did.", "NTA - I second the therapy for your GF but she may not be at the right place mentally yet.  Some things to consider:\n\nGF probably feels extreme loyalty and connection to her siblings. Trauma bonding is a thing and it is intense. \n\nConfronting neglectful abuse from a parent is so tough. You love them, you know they love you and it seems so contradictory that they would do these behaviors.   To you, an outsider,  it\u2019s obvious the behavior is f\u2019ed, to GF it\u2019s what she\u2019s always known, always had to cope with and has learned to work around.  Running On Empty by Jonice Webb is an outstanding book and usually free from the library.   Please give your GF tons and tons of grace and compassion in this department. Still have your boundaries & keep your child safe but as you enforce those boundaries use as much compassion for your GF as humanly possible.  \n\n\nGF likely has not separated herself/her loyalties from her family unit.  BC this kind of abuse really hammers in the loyalty concept as motivation/rationale for her to pick up their slack or tolerate their behavior. She may feel like it would be morally wrong to not \u201cbe there\u201d for them like she always has. Hopefully she can begin to change this thought process for your child.  Child should be #1 priority.\n\nGood luck.  I\u2019m rooting for you both.", "She breaks down crying remembering how shitty they were, but also thinks they can do no wrong?\n\nNTA, keep your kid away from those people and your partner needs therapy.", "Have you asked her is she a mom first or a sister/daughter first? I hate to point this out, but I hope she's not exposing your son to their finaciall and mental abuse.", "How could you both be happy if you're not on the same page???\n\nGet your wife some help. Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, and Toxic Parents are both really good resource books that are pretty cheap if she's afraid of leaving the house/your joined child together.\n\nShe deserves to be a better mom than her mother, without raising her mother's children. \ud83d\ude14 Poor honey.", "She doesn't seem like a bad person, or anything like that, but relationships, no matter how good they are, end, and the top priority must always be your child's well-being.  Have you ever suggested therapy to your girlfriend? She seems to suffer from Stockholm syndrome, and probably has very low self-esteem.", "Now we are.. it took for us to live together for her to realize and come out of her that what her family wasn\u2019t okay. She apologized for the times she didn\u2019t address anything her family did, but that\u2019s behind us. Now I just want them to stay away from my son", "No, quite the opposite she\u2019s the kindest person I know. And you\u2019re right, that\u2019s my angle on the whole thing once my son\u2019s wellbeing was put aside for money of all things I decided it was enough. And you\u2019re right it\u2019s probably that and I suspect it"]}
