The fact that she initiated contact with my sisters ex after they separated because she had a crush on him was also gross. \n\nSince we found out we went no contact with their whole family, who all had begun texting us asking us to give our blessing, to be part of the celebrations and to accept what was happening.\n\nWe continued to ignore them, but as they are family they showed up to extended family events and publicly asked my mum and sister to forgive them.\n\nMy mum and sister basically said \"be happy, live your life, we accept this is happening and we just all need to move on\". \n\nBut for me, I couldn't let it go so easily. So when I bumped into my aunt and cousin at another event, they jumped forward to hug me and I took a step back, and then asked them not to feel so familiar with me. \n\nThey followed me around until I raised my voice and said \"if I had done same to you, you would have never forgiven us. So why is it our responsibility to make you feel better about what you've done? You've made sure that we will never be rid of that man, that he'll be there at every family event. So no, I won't pretend everything is OK.\"\n\nI walked off, and while I don't take back my words, my sister did say to me that I should have just said nothing and let it all go. That she divorced him because he was a horrible man and when they find out, that is terrible enough for them.\n\nThat aunt has now told many people how upset she is, and I'm starting to feel bad about my explosion. Was I the asshole for publicly calling them out like that especially when my sister has taken such a calm approach to it all?\n\nTL;DR my 19 year old cousin is now engaged to my sisters 35 year old ex husband. My cousins family kept asking for forgiveness. My mum and sister gave acceptance of it, but I called out my aunt and cousin in front of a big family gathering.

Even so, we are in England so the age of consent is 16 (which I also am dead again). I guess until she realises he is a creep nothing can be done.", "So he lived with all of you in the family home?
