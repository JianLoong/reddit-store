The fact that she initiated contact with my sisters ex after they separated because she had a crush on him was also gross. \n\nSince we found out we went no contact with their whole family, who all had begun texting us asking us to give our blessing, to be part of the celebrations and to accept what was happening.\n\nWe continued to ignore them, but as they are family they showed up to extended family events and publicly asked my mum and sister to forgive them.\n\nMy mum and sister basically said \"be happy, live your life, we accept this is happening and we just all need to move on\". \n\nBut for me, I couldn't let it go so easily. So when I bumped into my aunt and cousin at another event, they jumped forward to hug me and I took a step back, and then asked them not to feel so familiar with me. \n\nThey followed me around until I raised my voice and said \"if I had done same to you, you would have never forgiven us. So why is it our responsibility to make you feel better about what you've done? You've made sure that we will never be rid of that man, that he'll be there at every family event. So no, I won't pretend everything is OK.\"\n\nI walked off, and while I don't take back my words, my sister did say to me that I should have just said nothing and let it all go. That she divorced him because he was a horrible man and when they find out, that is terrible enough for them.\n\nThat aunt has now told many people how upset she is, and I'm starting to feel bad about my explosion. Was I the asshole for publicly calling them out like that especially when my sister has taken such a calm approach to it all?\n\nTL;DR my 19 year old cousin is now engaged to my sisters 35 year old ex husband. My cousins family kept asking for forgiveness. My mum and sister gave acceptance of it, but I called out my aunt and cousin in front of a big family gathering.

You did what your sister and mom couldn\u2019t do and now they have to live with the reality and shame of what their daughter did.

They want to play happy family sure, but you do not have to participate. What your cousin did was shitty, and they should be thankful that you folks held your thoughts to yourself. They went too far.", "NTA. A reasonable person would find the insistence of your aunt and cousin on EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY GIVING THIS THEIR BLESSING AND MOVING ON a little \u2026 indicative of insecurity. \n\nYour story is an illustration of the deep human desire to enforce social cohesion.", "NTA. Thats some disgusting stuff. Personally, I would back the hell out of it. If they wanna get into that shit whatever I cant do anythig about it but theyre not gonna force me to accept the guy as famil or be expected to be okay in their presence.", "NTA. WHAT YOU SAID NEEDED TO BE SAID. THERE ARE SOME HURTS THAT \u201cI\u2019M SORRY\u201d WILL NOT SWEEP UNDER THE RUG. \n\nRemember THEY SOUGHT YOU out so they got what they came for. \n\nNEVER feel bad about how you feel. \n\nNEVER let someone tell you to get over something that wasn\u2019t done to them. You know what your sister experienced and what your family went through. \n\nWhen people do horrible things there are consequences. At the end of the day, it\u2019s only family that EXPECTS the forgive and forget madness. \n\nWhat your cousin did SAYS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE TYPE OF PERSON SHE IS. That alone is enough of a reason to avoid her.   \n\nNEVER, NEVER, NEVER keep a poisonous snake in your home, they ALWAYS bite. \n\nGoing forward, stay calm and distant.", "NTA- foregoing the creepy age gap, Your cousin is foolish to think this wouldn't jade you guys.", "NTA.

They eventually reconciled but I remained aloof for many years and my IL accepted my stance. And not once did my sister tell me not to feel the way I feel. Your sister might think the high road is ok; sometimes family needs to be taken to task too. You\u2019re NTA and i would\u2019ve done the same thing with ZERO remorse. I am in my 40s now and I have no tolerance for family bs.", "NTA, you said the truth, they just don\u2019t like hearing it. \n\nIt\u2019s not you or your family\u2019s job to ease their guilty conscience and that\u2019s what they are looking for. \n\nI hate when family are made to feel like they need accept horrible behavior just bc they are family. It\u2019s worse and idk why your aunt would be ok with this. I\u2019m sure they will find out first hand though as your sister pointed out.", "NTA and your ex BIL is a predator.

Even if your sister and mother are live and let live, doesn\u2019t mean you have to be. You are entitled to your own feelings and however you want to react. \n\nYou are definitely not an asshole for finding this creepy and having the reaction you did. I\u2019d flame them more publicly on social media if they continued badmouthing me but I\u2019m petty.", "NTA - You love your sister and do not relish her prolonged contact with someone who caused her great unhappiness. You had been avoiding them (which is a very nice way of keeping the peace) and they came up to get in your grill. Turns out there was some fire in your grill. They did not pick up on your subtle approach to setting boundaries, so you had to be more explicit. I may have seen this differently if you had tracked them down to vent.\n\nI have a feeling this family rift will resolve when the cousin finds out for herself what a loser she latched on to. When you all hate the ex-husband, you can be on the same side again.", "NTA, and you are right. She is bringing him right back into the fold. Perhaps you, your mom and sister should decide on a way forward. This could include avoiding family gatherings etc.", "NTA but he's been grooming this child for a while most likely. That her parents don't see anything wrong with this engagement is wild.", "NTA I just could never have sex with someone who screwed my cousin. What if he said things like,  \u201coh, your cousin gives bjs like this\u201d?! Blech. Major creepazoid vibes.", "ESH except your sister and cousin. Your cousin was quite clearly groomed by this man.

Just leave them and the guilt behind you.  Tell sis you understand what she is saying, sorry if she is mad at you, but you will not be apologizing.

So she was 18/19 then. And then yeah this man who is a creepy has persuaded her to get married, and she (who for years has said she just wants to be a house wife) easily said yes to the creepy man.\n\nBut legally, there is nothing anyone can do.

Fucked up yes, but it seems like the cousin reached out first, as an adult,  with romantic intentions.", "Didn't your sister get separated from him two years ago? Wouldn't that make your cousin 17? This man is a predator.", "Yes this is just really fucked up. Sounds like the 19 yr old cousin probably has a naive romanticized notion that this guy will provide her the life of her dreams. Especially a 19yr old that wants to be a housewife. He prob figure she\u2019ll be easy to manipulate and for some reason her family is ok with it."]}
