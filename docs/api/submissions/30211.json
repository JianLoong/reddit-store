She was living at home with her parents, brother, his gf and their child. The house became too crowded and she needed more space. I told her absolutely she could move in with me. \n\nAbout a week ago she was off work and was staying at my place (she hasn\u2019t moved her things in yet) and decided that she wanted to clean up for her move. She spent six hours cleaning my one bedroom apartment. My apartment is not spotless but in no means is it a disaster. The floors could be swept more often, the bathroom could get cleaned on a more regular basis, the dishes may go three days before they get washed. I got home that night and she had rearranged my pantry, bathroom and living room furniture, which was fine with me. \n\nThe fight began when she told me she had done this because she wanted to help me grow, that I live like a disorganized slob, and that I deserve to live in a happy clean home. I took offense to this. I know that I live like a bachelor, and that it could be cleaner but I thought slob was harsh. It boiled down to me asking that if she wanted to make changes that she just check in with me about. She lost her shit. She told me how unfair I was being that she had to check in with me every time she wanted to do something. She said that she did this as her love language and that I was an AH for even challenging her. I retorted with I just want a say with what effects both of us before it becomes her just deciding everything for us. \n\nSo I ask you, dear redditors, AITAH?", "created_utc": 1698971026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mi7p0/aita_when_it_comes_to_my_gf_moving_in/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When did \"this is my love language!!!\" become the new \"you can't set boundaries!!!\"? Don't make up with her. Stay in the fighting mode and don't let her move in, or you'll never get your personal space back. Trust me on this: my husband is a slob, and I go around tidying up the shit out of everything. But he has his own room/mancave, where he does whatever he wants, and I'm not bothered, I just close the door on him. In shared areas, my neatness rules. It won't work for you in a one-bedroom apartment *which is already yours.* Plus I never thought of my preference for neatness as \"helping him grow\" or \"love language\" -- that crap is just insulting. (Dishes should be washed every day though, sorry.)", "NTA - Tell her that you\u2019re reconsidering letting her move in if she\u2019s already this comfortable making these kinds of decisions in your home. The fact that she immediately insulted you and then got angry at you when you asked to be consulted before major changes speaks to some sort of control issue. If she isn\u2019t ready to communicate and compromise, she isn\u2019t ready to cohabitate.", "NTA and that's the first time I've heard love language weaponized. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9send her back", "No, but stop this nonsense before you go any further.

The red flags be waving fast and furious!", "NTA\n\nThat's not her love language; that's her controlling language.\n\nDO NOT let her move in.", "She shouldn't move in just to get away from the crowded house. What is her financial situation like?", "NTA  You and your girlfriend need to set the ground rules before she moves in because it is not okay to move furniture and reorganize a home without everyone who lives there or will live there in agreement. Moving people's belongings around and reorganizing their things is not a \"love language\", it's presumptuous and annoying", "NTA & you won\u2019t be happy if you let her move in\u2026 yet. \n\nShe sounds immature. Which I guess makes sense is she\u2019s been living with mummy & daddy for 30 years. \n\nHas she ever lived independently?\n\nThe best interpretation of her behaviour, is that since she\u2019s never lived as an adult before, she got over-excited & carried away, dreaming about \u201ca her own place she could be in control of\u201d - and she massively screwed up, because she didn\u2019t think that it\u2019s also YOUR place, that you have just as much right (if not more!) to also feel in control of. \n\nPut her move in on pause while you figure out if she just got too excited by the fun of moving in, and is willing to talk like a grown up (and apologise like a grown up!) when she\u2019s had a chance to think about it. \n\nBut if this is her default way of dealing with conflict (she tells you that you are wrong regardless of the facts, refuses to apologise) then you will be miserable with her. \n\nYou need to figure out which it is.", "oh man. Yeah - tell her your love language is for people to respect your boundaries. NTA", "YTA - if you leave dishes unwashed for 3 days, you are indeed a slob.", "NTA.  You two need to have a conversation. She insulted you and told you that she thinks  you are a slob after rearranging your entire house BEFORE she even lives there. You need to sit down and talk about what level of cleanliness is acceptable to each of you, what you expect from each other, and how you are going to resolve your differences.  I would not let her move in until  you have come to a firm agreement on all the topics you need to discuss.  She owes  you an apology.", "Best to resolve this major issue before she moves everything in.", "NTA. Don\u2019t move in with her", "NTA. I agree that she should check in with you before she makes changes. She doesn\u2019t even fully live there yet. Also shouldn\u2019t have called you a disorganized slob. but please - try not to take 3 days to do the dishes \ud83d\ude2d", "You... MIGHT want to consider the moving in together for a minute. I'm not making a judgement (although if pressed I'd lean toward N T A) but I think yall should learn to communicate a bit better before taking that leap.", "NTA.  She is terrifying!  You better maintain control of your house right this minute.  People who have cleaning obsessions are a little f\u2019d up and in my experience they\u2019re absolutely no fun to live with!", "Go to her house rearrange her closet, room see if she likes it.", "3 days before doing the dishes?\n\nMega slob lol", "Hmmmm.... Not washing the dishes for 3 days is definitely veering into slobish behaviour lol. I'd consider that a red flag if I was her.\n\nUltimately NTA. She should've asked first before doing anything.", "YTA. You are mad that she cleaned your house? you are a slob dishes should be washed everyday floor swept everyday. If she spent 6hours cleaning you are indeed a slob and need to grow   you are 32 man  clean up!", "Yeah, I can tell you\u2019re a slob.\n\nYTA", "Ehhhh, you are NTA. She is TA. Here is why. She does not need to call you a slob or be insulting. It sounds like you took her disparaging remarks in stride, do not allow words to trigger you. Women are emotional creatures...listen, be patient, and use words to discuss the issue at hand.\n\nFirst, set some boundaries. Have some areas that are off limits. \n\nI cannot tell you the amount of times I have left my sweatshirt on a kitchen chair and then it disappears into some black hole my wife spun up. I just go with it. She is a tidy woman. She maybe in the wrong for moving it, but I prefer to be happy than right. \n\nTalk to her, compromise when necessary, but I see it as a win win for you. You have someone who cares about you and she will clean your place. \n\nGood luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If it was her love language, she would have just done it and not tried to change you or order you to be different.

Nope out.", "NTA\n\nYou know, it's kind of bold of her to suggest she's helping you learn to \"grow up\" when she literally only moved out of mommy and daddies place because her current boyfriend has an apartment of his own. Between the two of you, mild bachelor mess aside, you're still the more adult person, a measure exemplified by the fact that you maturely asserted a boundary and she screamed back, \"IT'S MY LOVE LANGUAGE\" like that makes it ok.\n\nI really think you should strongly reconsider if it's wise for her to move in. She might be \"cleaner\", but your girlfriend sounds highly socially immature when it comes to cohabitation in a home with someone who isn't family.", "Yta. You're not mad that it\u2019s clean; you\u2019re mad she called you out on being a dirty.", "ESH because you need to wash those dishes and she shouldn\u2019t rearrange the furniture.
