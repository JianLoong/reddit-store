I also then left the group so-as to distance myself from X, because it wouldn\u2019t serve my hope of keeping open communication with my friends without his toxic comments.\n\nAfter this, X then asked to stay at my house in a few weeks so he could attend another one of our mutual friends wedding in December.  \n\nOvercame by his overreaction I texted X and requested an apology.  I also said he could not stay with me until the condition was met and hoped he would meet this requirement, but a week later this has not happened.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to other friends in this chat about X\u2019s behavior and they all think he can be hasty at times, but this leaves me distanced from my friends (who all live 4 hours+ away) and without further recourse.  \n\nThanks for reading and for your input.", "created_utc": 1667578851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym39uq/aita_for_distancing_myself/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The apology would be meaningless anyway.", "If I understand correctly, you posted something on the internet making fun of your friend\u2019s neighbor. When friend pointed out that wasn\u2019t nice, you got offended and quit your friend group. When your friend tried to forget about the whole thing and asked if he could stay with you, you brought it up again and made a big issue about it. Now you are trying to cause bad feelings toward that friend amongst your other friends\u2026and you call HIM toxic?\n\nI just don\u2019t get it. Unless I misunderstand something here, YTA.  Clearly.", "YTA. You make a joke about X's neighbor and X makes a joke about the neighbor's potential reaction... And you're angry about what exactly? Are you worried X will show the neighbor your joke and so you're afraid? Because if not I don't understand why you'd leave the group and demand an apology", "To add - this wouldn\u2019t be the first time this friend has said subtle demeaning comments.  Only the first time I\u2019ve  spoken up about it.", "I know it\u2019s not my job to teach humility but as a friend of 10+ years I felt it best to provide context as to why he wasn\u2019t welcome.", "Thanks for the reply.  To add, the picture was meant to jab at the friends neighbor, but it had been done several times before even by the friend who became hasty.  \n\nI also wasn\u2019t circling the wagons with pitchforks and haven\u2019t asked any friends about this encounter since it happened.  The behavioral talks came from these friends, from earlier than this encounter, unprovoked by me.", "To me it appeared as if he was trying to say something demeaning.  I honestly don\u2019t care if the neighbor saw it because it was a picture of a doll who just looked like his neighbor.", "That is a long time.", "I don't know, it seems as though you are the one who overreacted to a joke and allowed that to abandon a friendship of 10 years.  YTA", "What was demeaning?\n\nI can understand not being comfortable with jokes about violence - does your friend know you don't like this? And if not, why not just privately say you're uncomfortable with it instead of acting like he intentionally meant to hurt you", "IDK - having someone say they are going to cause physical harm to me sounds like a lousy way to continue the joke, but I could be wrong.", "No he doesn\u2019t know that I don\u2019t like to be told someone will cause physical harm to me.  I felt it was common knowledge that most people dislike being told someone will cause physical harm to you.", "I guess it was demeaning because no one likes to be told that they would be hurt by someone else."]}
