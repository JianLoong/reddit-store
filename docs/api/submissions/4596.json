I think now that we are married she tolerates me because she has to but she never makes me feel like family. \n\nWe had gathering with my husbands side of the family the other day and I was talking with his brothers wife, Kate (32F), about general pregnancy and birth stuff (she just had a baby in October). Eventually I asked her if she would join me in the delivery room as she is like a sister to me now and has been very supportive throughout my pregnancy. MIL overheard this conversation and asked if she would be there, to which I responded that I do not feel comfortable. I\u2019m nervous for my first time and I really only want people I trust and feel comfortable with to be there. \n\nMy MIL was NOT happy with this answer and threw a fit. She went directly to my husband and told him that if he didn\u2019t convince me to allow her in, he must not love her. She complained about how it wasn\u2019t fair Kate would be there but she wouldn\u2019t for her own grandchild\u2019s birth.
