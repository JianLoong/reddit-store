Sorry, English is not my first language. \n\nMy boyfriends works from home, but one day a week he goes to the office.

He needs to get up very early and has a pretty loud alarm. It not only awakens me, but then I have to turn off the alarm and give the phone to him. At that point I'm wide awake and can't sleep anymore. I have to get up 1 hour and 15 minutes later.\n\nIf the phone is on his side of the bed it does not disturb my sleep as much and I usually fall back to sleep. We can't switch sides as the path at my side is too small for him. I asked him to buy a power strip so it can charge at his side but he finds this unnecessary.\n\nI asked him to just charge his phone in the evening so it does not disturbs my sleep.

It's a big deal to you. Getting an extension cord isn't unnecessary to you (people suggesting us in the comments, did you read the post? OP he has asked for this already.)\n\nI assume the best intent from people, but this honestly seems like a weird flex, like he wants you to wake up when he wakes up, or he wants you to be responsible for him and somewhere in the mornings.", "NTA. He's being selfish for absolutely no reason, and there's nothing worse than not getting the sleep you need. Just buy an extension lead and put it there.", "NTA, but purchase an extension cord today.", "NTA \n\nThis whole situation is kind of funny. I personally would just buy that cord, they are normally not that expensive, and just take matters into my own hand. This would wind me up so badly. No, I couldn't cope with that x) it is kind of disrespectful of him to undermine you and make you sleep shitty..", "just get a portable charger", "NTA but you should just buy a power strip, don't know why that isn't an option.", "NTA. HTA because he knows this is bothering you and is dismissing it when it's such an easy thing to resolve. That said, it's also easy for you to resolve. Buy the power strip yourself, remind him in the evenings to charge his phone, buy him a cheap alarm clock so he doesn't need to set the phone alarm...", "Buy a powerbank.

It\u2019s not great that he forgets to charge the phone, but if you know it\u2019s going to happen there is no harm in you going to bed early with him to get a good sleep before waking up early. Before you do that, why not set an alarm on his phone to remind him to charge the phone in the evening? \nPressing an alarm button and handing him the phone isn\u2019t the end of the world. He should also be able to plan ahead.", "Esh. This is the kind of nonsense that sinks relationship ships. Buy an extension.

It\u2019s a bigger conversation about how he\u2019s dismissive of your needs and an extension cord isn\u2019t going to fix that.", "Bingo. I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t be singing the same tune if the roles were reversed.", "I think they're suggesting I buy it myself, but like  I said in one of my comments: We have like 6 charges around the house and he's at home the whole day so I don't see the point of spending money if he could just charge his phone the evening before.", "Yeah, I suppose it's not so much about buying the cord, but more about him dismissing my feelings and more important not thinking denying me my sleep is no big deal x.x", "Thats the first steps in the manual how you get a little kid for a husband", "He will forget to charge the powerbank :)", "Thank you for this advice. All things aside, it actually made me laugh out loud.", "Of course not, but we have like 6 charges around the house and he's at home the whole day so I don't see the point of spending money if he could just charge his phone the evening before.", "Are you seriously recommending that somebody change their sleep schedule in order to accommodate a partner who is refusing to just buy an extension cord?", "I already go to sleep very early because of this, but he does not (like maybe 1,5 hours later). He makes a lot of noise (which wakes me up again) so it doesn't really matter because I'm awake late anyway :')", "His phone is too old to be charged wireless. I already said in the post that I asked him to buy an extension cord ( I called it a power strip). We have like 6 charges around the house I don't see the point of spending money tho. \n\nBut like I said in one of the comments: I guess there's more to it. I do everything for him, make sacrifices and feel like I don't get the same input. But whenever I ask for something I need to suck it up and still have to do the thing myself because he thinks it's no big deal/finds it unnecessary.", "Yep, not surprised you are grumpy with him. He is disrespecting you.", "They generally hold enough charge to recharge a phone 2-4 times. And this would reduce the amount of times he would be charging his phone in ways that are inconvenient to you. I guess it depends what the actual problem is - whether it's the disruption of the phone beside you, or the frustration that he can't remember to take care of his own administration stuff.", "So this is the hill you're willing to die on?  \n\nLike he could do it.  He isn't doing it why not buy the extension cord and keep the peace?\n\nI'm sure you have a good reason. \n\nI've seem extension cords at the 99 cents only store.", "Yes. If OP isn\u2019t going to make him buy an extension cable, or just do it themselves, the next thing I\u2019m suggesting is that they go to bed together rather than waking each other up.", "Ugh. He needs to seriously be more considerate! You should just get yourself a new boyfriend based on this comment and others you've made", "Well that's a way bigger situation, and conversation, than when a phone gets charged. You're letting little things get to you because there are bigger things behind them. If it was only about a phone, you'd accept one of the very simple solutions presented here. The fact that you are resistant to that makes clear there are far bigger issues at play.", "I guess there's more to it.

You are all right; there's an easy solution and ESH.", "OK.  That's fair.  But I think that's a far bigger conversation. And maybe one he doesn't realize you guys need to have.  In isolation it seems small but I'm sure it's death by a million cuts.", "Hold up, not so fast. A lot of your posts are about your BF ignoring your needs, and you've been deemed NTA more than once. That should tell you something. I know I'm just a stranger on the internet, but if I may: man or woman, straight or not, whatever culture, religion, age, or anything else - if you're partner shows you no respect, why continue to torment yourself? What are you getting from them that is worth feeling disrespected all the time?", "Yeah, our relationship has been great for the last 4 years. But now that we're having plans of moving in together, a lot of issues started to surface. I must admit I have high standards, but I always try to meet his. I think it's fair to ask he does the same or to BOTH make sacrifices.\n\nOur relationship is great outside of the house and we've been together for 5,5 years so I don't want to give us up yet.\n\nIt's right around the time I found this platform (am I the asshole) hence the many posts.", "I certainly wouldn't presume to give you advice, but...if you've felt the need to make \"many posts\", and have been deemed NTA each time, maybe consider that before you commit to a live-in relationship?", "I know you're all just strangers on the internet, but I wanted some second opinions about all this. I have no one to talk to (except for my mother). After all the NTA's I do indeed really need to think about this. Thanks anyway :)"]}
