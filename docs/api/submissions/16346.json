It\u2019s not great that he forgets to charge the phone, but if you know it\u2019s going to happen there is no harm in you going to bed early with him to get a good sleep before waking up early. Before you do that, why not set an alarm on his phone to remind him to charge the phone in the evening? \nPressing an alarm button and handing him the phone isn\u2019t the end of the world.

He needs to seriously be more considerate! You should just get yourself a new boyfriend based on this comment and others you've made", "Well that's a way bigger situation, and conversation, than when a phone gets charged.

You are all right; there's an easy solution and ESH.", "OK.  That's fair.  But I think that's a far bigger conversation. And maybe one he doesn't realize you guys need to have.  In isolation it seems small but I'm sure it's death by a million cuts.", "Hold up, not so fast. A lot of your posts are about your BF ignoring your needs, and you've been deemed NTA more than once. That should tell you something. I know I'm just a stranger on the internet, but if I may: man or woman, straight or not, whatever culture, religion, age, or anything else - if you're partner shows you no respect, why continue to torment yourself?

But being upset and continuing to do the same thing is\u2026nonsensical.", "I mean clearly, he\u2019s unable or unwilling to do that. Some people can\u2019t struggle with that kind of organization and planning. Maybe he likes using his phone in the evenings. Maybe he just will always forget.\n\nAnd yes, you could buy a power cord yourself. It bothers me that it\u2019s your responsibility to do that, and it bothers me how much she is ignoring your needs.

Happy anniversary gift, for both of you. Take some initiative and be done with this issue.", "NTA. If it's not a big deal to him, then he shouldn't have any issue changing. Clearly it matters to you, so if he cares about you then he should accommodate your request unless he has a compelling reason not to. He's being a selfish lazy asshole.\n\nAlso power strip is a perfectly legit phrase, no need to apologise! If it's just a single socket at the end of a lead, then yeah that's not a strip, but if it's one of the ones with a bunch of sockets then power strip is a totally normal name to call it.", "YATA.\n\nI'm sorry but i have a wonderful  girlfriend that also doesn't need to get up when i do but that women will get up when my alarm goes off.

It worked out really well for years.", "Most people charge their phones at night and why not switch sides of the bed.", "I feel you on this, and love that you expressed honestly that it's not about the cord to you. Most relationship counselors point out it's usually not about the cord, the dishes, whatever the \"symptom\" is.\n\nThat being said, take the opportunity to see if in this case it really is just the cord. By removing that issue with the extension you can relieve that symptom at least and then will see if you're feeling that sense of your feelings being dismissed anywhere else. If it keeps coming up that's what really needs to be addressed.\n\nBut on the Chance he really doesn't mean anything by it and is just forgetful...the new cord should help out a lot. :)"]}
