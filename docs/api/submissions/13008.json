{"id": 13008, "submission_id": "11zq2f6", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter it\u2019s just a dress and she\u2019s being dramatic?", "selftext": "I\u2019m a single dad to 3 daughters. This revolves around my middle, \u201cJuliet\u201d (17F). A few weeks ago, I took her shopping for her prom dress. She picked one that she absolutely loved and she truly looks like a princess.\n\nThen, last week, she was very upset because she saw on Instagram that a classmate (not a friend, but someone in her grade) had bought the same dress, but in a different color. She tried asking the other girl to change and the girl (rightfully) told her no. I was sympathetic and let her vent, also adding that it was a different color so at the very least, it wasn\u2019t too similar.\n\nThe issue is, Juliet has been trash talking the girl for the past week. This is very out of character for her, she\u2019s never been a gossip. But I\u2019ve heard her venting to her friends about it. I let it go because what does venting really matter?\n\nThen I got a call from Juliet\u2019s history teacher saying that she overheard Juliet talking poorly about this girl repeatedly. While the girl is not in the class and there\u2019s no evidence of bullying, she is worried it\u2019ll get there.\n\nI sat Juliet down and said while I understand completely that this is frustrating and I may not get all that comes with dresses and such, this isn\u2019t fair to the other girl. From what it seems, she didn\u2019t purposefully do this to hurt her. I pointed out the different colors. Also offered to take her to return the dress and she could get another if having a unique dress was that important.\n\nJuliet said that she shouldn\u2019t have to get a new dress. She kept trash talking this girl. I finally told her \u201cIt\u2019s a dress. Your feelings are valid but you need to stop being so dramatic and let it go.\u201d This upset her and she left the room in tears. I tried talking to her about it but she stayed in her room.\n\nMy eldest (22F) told me I technically wasn\u2019t wrong but I shouldn\u2019t have said it.\n\nI really try not to be a bumbling dad who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. I learned all stuff related to raising girls, have always made it clear they can come to me for anything, etc. If I need to outsource a problem or they want a woman to talk to, they have their godmother (late wife\u2019s best friend).\n\nWas I the ass here?\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nI want to thank everyone for your feedback and advice. Some of you suggested there is much more going on here and I agreed.\n\nI sat down with Juliet again and said I standby my sentiment, but I also think there has to be more going on. As I said, it\u2019s just a dress and this isn\u2019t like her at all. Some of you suggested perhaps she had prior history with this girl. She said no, they don\u2019t even really talk. They only follow each other on social media because \u201ceveryone follows everyone\u201d. \n\nI pushed more and asked why a dress was so important. She eventually admitted it wasn\u2019t. Then went onto say that she\u2019s felt weird about prom this whole time and her senior year overall. When I asked why, she started crying and said she missed her mom, she wished she was here, etc.\n\nMy wife passed when Juliet was 5 so she never truly had her for any of those big milestones that a girl would have with a mother. Watching her friends go through all these things with their mom reminded her that she doesn\u2019t have one.\n\nI gave her a big hug and held her while she cried. I cried a little myself. I knew that Juliet struggled with her mom\u2019s death but had no clue it was still such an issue.\n\nOnce she calmed down, Juliet insisted that she hadn\u2019t ever said anything to the girl but agreed to apologize for even asking her to change the dress. She also promised to stop talking junk. I told her next time to just talk to me about it. I miss her mom too. When my eldest was going through all these milestones her senior year, I definitely felt that someone was missing and that my wife should be there.\n\nSo crisis is over. I know some said to ban her from going to prom and if she had continued her behavior, I would\u2019ve. But considering she\u2019s going to apologize and is letting it go, I feel that\u2019s an overreaction.", "created_utc": 1679590065, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zq2f6/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_its_just_a_dress_and/", "score": 1331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bullying another student over a prom dress is an AH move.  They aren't even the same color!", "NTA\n\nYou aren't wrong at all, it is just a dress. I really thought this thread would be going somewhere else, but trash talking a girl for buying the same dress in a different color is horrible. And it is a type of bullying if she's doing it to the point where a teacher calls you about it. Honestly I'd tell my child if she kept this up then I'd cancel the prom because it's not that serious at all", "NTA. Being THAT upset about a dress is overly dramatic. Does she do the same thing when someone else is wearing the same jeans/shirt/jacket/shoes as she is? We live in a world where things are mass produced and *shockingly* people end up wearing the same things, sometimes even at the same time! I would hate to see this behavior stay with her through college. It does sound like she is on a boarder of bullying this other girl though. I hope that she doesn't and you offered her multiple options that she turned down. She needed a dose of reality.", "NTA. Your daughter is being super dramatic about something that's nobody's fault. At almost every big event, people are going to be wearing similar things. She needs to just get over it.", "NTA & imo you\u2019ve been nothing but nice about the whole situation. \nYour daughter comes across as a spoilt bully & maybe she isn\u2019t mature enough for Prom!", "NTA.  It sounds like you're doing everything you can, and if you want honesty, my parents wouldn't have been so patient.  They were great growing up, but I probably would have been told if this doesn't stop asap, I'm going to lose (fill in blank).  They weren't big on teachers getting involved with my behavior!", "NTA\n\n17 is way too old to be behaving like a child and having a temper tantrum.  \n\nHow would she feel if the other girl had asked her to buy another dress then trash talked her when she wouldn't?\n\nIn the good old days before the internet she'd have only found out about it when she went to the prom.", "NTA- maybe not the best phrasing but you're trying to give her a reality check. The ongoing bad mouthing of this girl is concerning behaviour of your daughter though. She's 17 not 13 she's too old for this type of behaviour", "NTA, and your oldest is wrong. You are the parent, and you are parenting. Your 17 year old is having an inappropriate tantrum about a very minor issue. If it was a quick meltdown and done, that would be fine. The current behavior is not fine, and you are working with her to deal with it. That's what parenting is.", "NTA. You tried your best, you understand where your daughter is coming from and tried to be reasonable. Unfortunately 17 y/o girls are very....temperamental, to say the least. Imo you handled it the best that you could. She shouldn't have been so upset that she was bullying the other girl over a dress and a teacher had to step in. If that was me, my parents wouldn't have let me go to prom.", "NTA\n\nYour words weren't the best, but at this point,  Juliet needs a wake-up call before it will escalate. With her attitude I wouldn't be suprised if she planned to \"accidentally\" destroy this girl's dress during a prom...", "NTA. The only thing that would make me understand Juliet's perspective a bit more here is if she posted the picture of her dress first. I don't know what it's called, but some groups/schools have a place to post your dress so there are no duplicates. If Juliet had already posted (with the understanding that the dress style was claimed) and the other girl then came in and bought the same dress, I can see why she would be upset. \n\nSince it is so out of character to behave like this and Juliet is refusing to change her dress, I am guessing something like this happened. \n\nNgl, it was much easier when I was younger. If we came in the same dress, we laughed and took a picture on our actual cameras. Sometimes, being old is easier.", "NTA. I raised two daughters. You handled it correctly.", "Nta this is part of patenting. Dresses are MASS produced. If she wants something unique she needs to custom order one.\n\nDegrading someone else bc you both picked the same dress is ridiculous and I think you need to be firm.

You offered to take her to get a different dress, that\u2019s really the best you can do.  There\u2019s nothing she can do to make the other girl not wear the dress, and she\u2019s obviously taking the trash-talking too far if a teacher is calling you about it. You handled it appropriately.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m wondering if this might be about more than just the dress?  Prom is a pretty big milestone for most high schoolers, maybe she is upset about mom not being here for it, but is making it about a dress instead?  Just something to consider.", "NTA but for future reference : from experience, telling a teenager something they think is a big deal is not a big deal is a bad idea, it never goes down well\ud83d\ude02 you would have been better off telling her that she was being a bad person by bad mouthing the other girl", "NTA. Your daughter needs to understand she has control over how she reacts to this situation. Right now she's choosing to be incredibly self-centered and mean. This season on the Bachelor, two contestants were wearing the same dress in different colors on night one. They both thought it was cute and took pictures together. The dress looked great on both of them - they both had great taste! Maybe your daughter could choose to react in a more gracious way - turn lemons into lemonade. Or just avoid the other girl all night? This just sounds really petty for a 17 year old.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter needs to learn sooner rather than later, that the world and everyone else in it, do not revolve around her and her feelings. \n\nThis is an important lesson that all teenagers need to be taught a hell of a lot earlier than 12th grade. \n\nSo many parents teach their kids that they are the most precious amazing person that has ever been born. You are not doing your children any favors by lying to them like that. \n\nThis type of parenting is also the reason we have such a huge problem with so many kids being mean nasty bullys.", "The only thing I'd fault you for is saying her feelings are valid. Being mad at someone because they bought a mass-produced item at a store is not \"valid.\" \n\nIt would be valid if she were upset that she doesn't have a unique dress. (Sort of. Don't buy a dress from a store if you want a unique one that no one else owns, but I guess that's a learnable thing), but not valid to get upset at this other girl. \n\nOtherwise NTA", "NTA but it\u2019s time to teach Juliet that she needs to grow the fuck up. She will get fired for this behavior in the not so near future so maybe you should remove the issue for her. She doesn\u2019t want to be in the same dress as another girl at prom? Ok, problem solved and she doesn\u2019t go! Put your foot down you are not doing her any favors she is old enough to know better than TJ trash talk someone like this and get away with it!", "No, take the dress back.

But I'm glad I didn't have this problem as a teen. I did see other girls get upset over silly stuff like this though.

Just let her vent and cry it out.", "NTA, your daughter needs to get over it asap.", "NTA - I do not know much about fashion, but it seems like most companies produce clothing of the same type in different colors all the time. Given prom is a limited time of the year, the various styles probably are not as varied as most other clothing options, so somebody ending up with the same dress does not seem surprising.", "NTA-I get that she is upset about the dress but trash talking non-stop is not ok. And it's clearly not sooo important because she's not willing to get another one instead.", "NTA. Your daughter is being an age appropriate AH. I never understood the obsession of being \"copied\" there are billions of humans on the planet and how many prom shops? It's bound to happen. Daughter doesn't have her full brain yet so cut her some slack. Hopefully she stops bullying the other girl before she gets prom taken away from her all together!

I once attended an event with a co-worker and she was wearing a very similar dress as the one I had shown her before as my planned attire. We laughed and took photos. But we aren't teenagers.

If it was my daughter I'd tell her to knock it off or she wont be going to any dance.", "NTA if it's at a point that a teacher has reached out to you about it, your daughter crossed a line", "NTA.  Your daughter is old enough to stop stomping her feet and kicking up a fuss like a two-year old in the playground.  I get it - the girl has the same dress but you're right - she didn't do it on purpose.  It was an unfortunate coincidence.  Your daughter expecting her to switch her dress is spoiled and entitled.  If she were mine and kept the trash talk going, she would not have to worry with the dress because she wouldn't be going.", "NTA, She is well old enough to understand to not treat little deals like they\u2019re the end of the world and she definitely should know better than to talk bad about someone even if they provoked her. It\u2019s just a dress in a different color, the girl wasn\u2019t copying her, it was all just a coincidence. Juliet was acting like a 6 year old and besides she\u2019s 17; she\u2019s almost a legal adult. While you could\u2019ve phrased your words a little differently she needs to be called out for her how she\u2019s reacting because that is not normal for her age", "Is the dress your daughter picked out somehow similar (colour, shape, etc) to your late wife's prom dress? Maybe she feels this is a way to feel closer to her mom and feels she's lost even that connection because in her mind her dress isn't \"unique\" anymore?\n\nNTA for how you handled the situation, your daughter shouldn't be trash talking the other girl. But if this is out of character for your daughter she might have some feelings about not having her mom around for an important part of her life.", "NTA whatsoever. Maybe you shouldn't have said \"stop being dramatic\" but... she is being very dramatic. The odds of finding the same dress as someone else aren't low.\n\n\nYou've said this is out of character for her, so I assume there's something else that's causing her to lash out. You mentioned that your wife is deceased (and my condolences), maybe this is related to not having her mother see her in her prom dress?\n\nI don't mean to be an armchair psychologist, but I think you need to dig a little deeper. \n\nIt needs to be clear that the way she is acting is unacceptable and hurtful, but maybe she is having trouble processing some feelings. (again, still not an excuse and she should apologize if the other girl is aware of your daughter's behavior)", "NTA. I don't think this is about the dress at all. Time to have a sit down and ask what's eating her. Lay out that no judgement will be passed and whatever she says during the talk will be handled between you two, not involving the other sisters or boyfriends or whatever. She's got some big feelings about something in her life and the prom dress is a scapegoat. Assure you love her, want to support her, want her to feel happy and confident in all she does, and want her to be excited for prom without holding on to negative emotions. You got this, you're a good dad", "NTA, unless the dress is custom made, it\u2019s likely that several girls will show up in the same dress. They all shop at similar stores and not all of them post on instagram before hand. It\u2019s very common and this even happens with lesser stars who don\u2019t have dresses custom made by the fashion designers.  I would suggest you tell her to be ready for others to show up in the same dress.\n\nWhat would\u2019ve happened if the other girl didn\u2019t post and they unknowingly wore the same dress? It sounds like OP\u2019s daughter might be a bit insecure and thinks the other girl might be wearing it better.", "NTA", "NTA. There was a really pretty girl at my prom who had the same dress as me, color and all. I noticed and started to get upset when one of my teachers saw me and asked why it mattered. I stuttered and couldn't give a real answer so she smiled and said all that matters is that I look amazing. That one comment made my night so much better. \n\nMaybe you could tell your daughter something similar. Why does it matter if another girl has the same dress if your daughter already looks beautiful in hers? Maybe don't put the other girl down by saying your daughter looks better, but at least let your daughter know that regardless of anyone else, SHE will look incredible and that's what she should focus on.", "NAH. It goes without saying that you can\u2019t fix her problem in the manner she wants it fixed, but she was only doing what you taught her to do and coming to you with her problems. She\u2019s an adolescent girl and the occasional irrational problem comes with the terrority. I would draw the line on bullying but if she\u2019s just venting to you privately, all you need to do is be an ear for her to complain to and a shoulder for her to cry on.", "NTA. Your daughter has some choices to make about her behaviour and the dress. She must admit and stop the bullying before she is allowed to celebrate Prom. Then she can keep or return the dress. Maybe her big sister can go along to offer advice about the dress.", "NTA! You are right your daughter is being overdramatic about a dress.", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter is becoming a bully. I'd let her know that if this behavior continues she won't have to worry about matching prom dresses because she wouldn't be going.", "NTA - but there are ways to make her dress different and special, you can take it to a tailor/dressmaker and change certain things, or accessorize it differently (shoes, jewelry, a wrap, etc) can really make the look unique. If things move into a bullying direction you're going to have to impose consequences, and I'd make that clear to her.", "NTA I remember being surprised when a college friend explained that at her school there was a whole system to prevent this from happening  and that the local stores even kept track to avoid selling the same dress to the same school (I\u2019m not sure I believe that last bit, but the message group where people called dibs on dresses seemed plausible). At my school, you wore what you wanted and no one cared about overlap. I have no clue what your daughter\u2019s school is like but I can\u2019t think of anything  about picking a dress that justifies her. All you did was speak to her to say that her behavior was not appropriate - that\u2019s like the absolute minimum a parent can do. So no, NTA", "NTA. I understand her being upset. At least it is a different color.", "Honestly, this is all very out of character for her. She\u2019s never been one to care about fashion. I know sometimes her friends have worn the same outfits. She doesn\u2019t normally buy anything relatively unique. \n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some sort of prom dress culture? Or if something is going on? I know I\u2019m her dad so maybe I\u2019m biased, but this is brand new behavior.", "There's actually a famous picture from the 1940s or 1950s of a society event in NYC where several women showed up in The Exact Same Dress! So, one quirky woman among the herd got them all lined up and they did the conga line throughout the event to celebrate their mutual good taste.\n\nThat's how you handle it - not being the mean girl bully.", "She did post her dress on Instagram but I can buy that maybe the other girl didn\u2019t see it. As they have no history, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d maliciously try to upstage my daughter. Or maybe she didn\u2019t see the big deal behind it?", "If this is a new behavior, then it might be worth having a deeper conversation with her when she is more calm. Even if it is, that does not excuse her behavior in general. Someone having the same dress but in a different color is no reason to bad mouth and/or bully someone else.", "I worked at a bridal shop back in the day. There is a prom dress culture, to the point that dress shops will track which dresses are sold to who, in what color, and at what school. \n\nI\u2019m not saying your daughter is right, but having a unique gown really is a thing.", "I would venture a guess and say this is deeper than the dress? Maybe there are other reasons she has negative feelings about the other girl, and the dress thing just gave her an excuse to act out? Or it might be some completely different stuff going on in her life which gets channelled into this dress/prom situation?", "I'm wondering if she has some sort of prior issue with this girl that you are not aware of? If you're saying this is out of character behaviour I'm inclined to believe there's something more going on that just her wearing the same prom dress", "Maybe it's about a boy? First crush? Still doesn't excuse bullying.  It's probably the end of the world for her, but it is just a dress. \n\nI would warn her that if she continues to vent about the other girl,  she will not be allowed to go to the prom at all. Either she exchanges the dress or keeps the one she has. If she meets up with the other girl at prom wearing the same dress but different colors, I myself would laugh and say \"you have awesome taste.  Love your dress.\" NTA", "It sounds like the other girl didn't see the dress posted, and she wants to wear it, too. \n\nI would ask Juliet why it's upsetting her so much. Let her know you're on her side, but the options are limited as far as what can be done since no one can (or should) force the other girl to get a new dress. The world knows this isn't a big deal, but it is to Juliet. The bottom line is that she needs to know that this is a priority for you because it is important to her. Good luck with everything. I hope it works out.", "Agreed. I also don't think she's right to be mean about it but it *is* way more of a thing than it used to be. It seems like most high schools have a senior prom dress group where everyone posts their dress once they pick it to ensure no one wears the same thing. I can imagine if your daughter is this upset she feels the other girl broke the social code in some way and there was some intention behind it", "There could be. She\u2019s normally not one to shy away from talking to me about things. She\u2019s told me about other incidents.\n\nBut again, I\u2019m her dad. There are things I certainly didn\u2019t tell my parents at 17.", "Looks / size wise how different are the two girls? Could she be thinking that she will look horrible in the dress in comparison? Maybe there is someone she wants to impress?", "It\u2019s been almost a decade since I\u2019ve been a teen girl but that was my first thought. Julie\u2019s worried about being directly compared in a unkind way to the other girl.", "Her feelings stopped being valid when she started blaming the other person for them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad that this girl happened to buy the same dress as me\u201d is valid, because it\u2019s simply expressing her feelings on the situation.\n\nAsking her to change her dress? Craaazy entitled. That girl has no reason or obligation to cater to her, just like your daughter would certainly not have done the same if the situations were reversed. Also if it\u2019s got to the point that the teacher is noticing it\u2026bullying is like already happening. The fact your eldest thought that your response was inappropriate when in fact it was outrageously soft, sort of tells me you\u2019ve likely coddled your daughters too much and they have become spoiled, likely out of some misplaced notion that you need to make for being a single dad and guilt that your daughters had to experience the grief of losing their mother. That does not mean, you need to be soft with them. You can be empathetic while still being *strict* when necessary.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be harsh, the tone just comes across as you always trying to placate them\u2026rather than parent them here. And that\u2019s not good for anybody. My apologizes if this comes across in a bad way though, my heart goes out to you for losing your wife while still having to figure out to raise 3 grieving children. That\u2019s a lot.

And they will, because teenagers, and especially teenager girls, are vicious about these kinds of things. She\u2019s likely trying to stir people up to be ahead of the punch before the event even happens to assuage this.\n\nI would offer to see if you can have alterations done to the dress to make her stand out, or maybe see if you can redirect her attention to other details she can use to feel more confident like getting her hair and makeup done extra special, maybe finding some nice accessories, etc. The challenge here is to not make it seem like you\u2019re rewarding her behavior, rather that you understand where it\u2019s coming from and still disapprove, but ultimately want her to enjoy her special night.\n\nI think you would have more success having your oldest probe the topic a bit first since she may feel more comfortable confiding in another woman, since this is a somewhat uniquely gendered experience and expectation being placed on her. Teenage girls go HARD for their dresses.\n\nNTA.", "NTA it's a mass produced dress. Y T A for raising such a spoiled, entitled bully and making excuses for her.

To be clear, I don\u2019t think you called your daughter dramatic because she\u2019s a girl\u2014you did it because she\u2019s being a dramatic teen.

Inquire about her reasons without shutting them down\u2014yeah, even when you know they suck.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with her at all, but don\u2019t outside dismiss her arguments. She\u2019s a teenager, she won\u2019t listen. Then, ask her, what if the situation was reversed? Would she still feel entitled to also wear the dress? Would she be okay with someone trash talking her?*Would she think someone who would trash talk another person for having good taste, deserved to wear the dress more than the person who was gracious about it?*\n\nRemind her that she not the sole owner of her prom dress any more than she is the sole owner of her name, or her haircut. Point out that it\u2019s not a competition. Ask her, does she want to shine at prom solely because of a specific dress? Or does she want to shine for being who she is while wearing that dress? Make it clear to her that she\u2019s not going to be random girl in this dress: she\u2019s going to be *herself,* and that that\u2019s what matters. And that, if this other girl is also herself in this dress, they can celebrate their good taste together. Part of wanting to be unique, is learning to laugh about it when you\u2019re not quite as unique as you thought. Help her cope with her teenage feelings of trying to assert her individuality, when she shares that with someone else. Try to get at what she wants out of being the only person wearing this dress.\n\nShe also deserves a stern talking to about how she\u2019s been treating this other girl. But even if it seems counterintuitive, handle her feelings first, so that she\u2019ll be receptive to it. Teenagers can and will shut out anything with their hurricane of teenage emotions.\n\nThis is maybe a very personal suggestion, but if your late wife wore a non-custom dress to your wedding, maybe pull out pictures. Point out to Juliet how, your late wife was not the only bride to ever wear that dress, but to you, she still was the most important bride, and that the fact that more dresses existed takes nothing away from the specialness and love. If her older sister is in sorta-functioning-adult-brain territory, you may also want to loop her in, as she\u2019ll also have grown up in the social media era.\n\nI wish you and your daughters (and Juliet\u2019s dress doppelg\u00e4nger) all the best.", "NTA - your daughter is being a bully.  She doesn't own the rights to a dress and doesn't get to dictate what other people wear.  I think you handled it well, but get a female role model to speak with her about it, and explain to your kid that her actions are toxic and will not be tolerated.  I would also consider punishing her if she continues the bullying.", "NTA, and at this point canceling her prom attendance needs to be on the table", "NTA I literally wore the exact same dress as another girl and it was orange sequins, like the last dress you would expect to see once, forget two of them! I didn't even care, I would have gotten a picture with her except my friends told me she looked mad so I just ignored her, I didn't even know who she was.  \n\nSome bridal/dress shops take down your information including your school because they won't sell the same dress to two people (I lived in a city, YMMV), so if that's true for your area I could see her frustration that there was some semblance of a system to prevent such a thing, but even so it doesn't excuse her behavior. Also this stuff is so seasonal half the girls at her prom will all be wearing the same color, it was navy blue when I went to my first prom, it was red the next year, it does not matter and if anyone even notices they won't remember that, they will remember your daughter being awful about it though. I would wonder if there is something more going on with your daughter though. Like is it really about the dress or does she feel inadequate and this was her time to shine? Or does she like the color of the other one better? Is the other girl more well liked or way less popular?  Her behavior isn't okay, but if this is truly unlike her she could probably use some compassion on top of the reality check you already gave her because something bigger might be happening.", "Sorry this is gonna sound all getoffmylawn-y but this is one of those insufferable rich people things: \u201cI can\u2019t have the same dress as anyone else\u201d is right up there with spending what a working class person earns in a month on one prom night, etc. and there\u2019s really no way for you to undo her attitude because it\u2019s endemic thanks to everyone thinking they have to be uNiQuE so they can make a living as an influencer. \n\nNTA - she\u2019s bullying someone over a fucking dress.", "NTA. She\u2019s being an entitled brat. I get being upset for half a second over someone having the same dress in A DIFFERENT COLOR, but it should end there and it should certainly never cross into bullying territory. She is being over dramatic. I\u2019d write the teacher back and tell her to send her to detention/principles office next time she hears it and let that teacher know they have your full support to do so.", "NTA. It's just a dress. The world will not end if two people wear the same dress- not even in the same colour. It's certainly no excuse for her to be a dick to this other young woman about it.", "NTA for the most part.  I'd have advised you to focus less on the \"it's only a dress\" and more on \"I know this is frustrating, but don't take it out on this other girl\" part.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019d better stop bullying this poor girl before the school bans her from prom in any dress. There are only so many prom dress styles and colors. There\u2019s always going to be a chance that someone else is in a similar dress.", "NTA. Just tell you daughter no one will remember what dress she wears when the will all be focused on the asshole underneath it! /jk", "Nta you are correct in your thinking but can you maybe make her a scarf mini jacket ( with arms) or something unique with the dress  ?  Have a professional  dressmaker Apply something she likes on the dress, something meaningful maybe  ( a bit of lace in certain spots or something similar)?\n\n This could solve the problem .\n\nI do get she doesn't want to have the same dress but verbally attacking the schoolmate is not ok.", "You\u2019re doing great dad! She is being unreasonable and you are right to call her out on it. This is not a big deal and she needs to get over it and stop being mean to the other girl.", "NTA. My question is do you think your daughter is afraid that the other girl will look much better in the dress? DO NOT ASK HER THIS! I\u2019m just wondering if that could be it. Since you\u2019ve given her the option to change it but she won\u2019t , maybe this isn\u2019t it. But it really doesn\u2019t make sense for her to be this upset given her options to change it.", "NTA, but I do want to say that no emotion should ever be considered dramatic, nor should reactions caused by these emotions. We are all human and it's important that your daughter knows that what she's saying and believing is hurtful and wrong, but saying its dramatic can be seriously invalidating to her. Maybe it is to you, but she's got her own brain that you've got to pick and find a way to get through to her. What she's doing is shitty. She's being an asshole. But the word \"dramatic\", at least IMO, isn't a good descriptor. She's being an ass. But dramatic? I think no. Again, you're NTA here and are being a good dad by trying to find a compromise and letting her know she's in the wrong.", "NTA. The only mistake you made was to call her, \u201cdramatic.\u201d She isn\u2019t being dramatic, she\u2019s being a bully, and you should tell her so. If it continues, maybe ground her from going to prom at all. Her behavior is horrible.", "NTA It is a mass produced garment.  Thousands have been made and sold and worn by other girls.  Your daughter is being ridiculous.  \n\nI've heard about this claiming a dress thing by teenage girls via group chats.  It very easily turns to bullying if you have a group who agree to it and a group who don't or don't know about the \"dress pact\".   \n\nSo different from when I was in high school, we just accepted that if you bought off the rack, there was going to be at least 2 or 3 other girls there in the same dress.", "NTA. She is being dramatic and a bully. I'm surprised the school is still allowing her to go. I wouldn't trust her to not intentionally ruin this other child's night.", "NTA your daughter is acting as an entitled, selfish B. She is bullying, demeaning and belittling this girl. This behavior is not acceptable and needs to be stopped now before she runs into someone who will put her in her place if you get what I'm saying!?!", "NTA it\u2019s just a dress. It\u2019s even in a different colour. And she\u2019s old enough that you shouldn\u2019t have to coddle her when she\u2019s literally bullying another girl. Geez, if I did even half of this, my mom wouldn\u2019t have let me go to prom at all.", "It's just the prom.  In 20 years she won't give a damn about this.  My prom was mildly amusing at best, but not terribly memorable.  OP's daughter has a lot of years ahead of her, and her life is probably being recorded online for future employers and colleges and graduate schools to see.  Is this dress really the most important thing in the eighty-something years she plans to live, to the exclusion of future relationships, jobs, and education?", "NTA\n\ni would've gone no prom for you.", "Read this after the update was added. Really heartwarming, glad it worked out.", "Yes exactly, NTA. What will she do in the future if she shows up to work and someone happens to be wearing the same outfit? I mean there\u2019s a limited amount of places to shop in an area so someone else buying the same dress is bound to happen. If you are going to get bent out of shape over that then make your own dress or go to Etsy.", "I was around during the days of the internet and only found out about 2 or 3 other girls wearing the same dress as me at homecoming. I wasn't upset about it.", "Please read the update.", "They used to keep a list at the formal shop in town about what girls from which schools bought dresses to prevent duplicates. This was in the 60s. This dress craziness has been going on for a long time.", "You just reminded me of a Facebook group we had called the \u201cplayer haters club\u201d and all the more popular kids would shit talk and bully eachother lmao it was insane. They did have a rule that you couldn\u2019t talk about someone who hadn\u2019t participated so for people like me it was just straight entertainment. School ended up shutting it down anyway but wow I learned a LOT of dirt about my classmates. Was bummed to see it go \ud83d\ude02\n\nETA: NTA you\u2019re doing great dad!", "Just because your high school was like this doesn't mean that everyone else's is.\n\nAlso update proves you wrong.", ">I mean there\u2019s a limited amount of places to shop in an area so someone else buying the same dress is bound to happen\n\nI had 2 or 3 other girls wear the same dress as me to homecoming. At least 1 was the exact same color and everything. I wasn't the least bit upset about it. Just a oh moment.", "INFO:\n\nIs this girl not liked by your daughter/her friend group?  If so,  why?", "Her colleagues might make fun of her for having the same dress. That might be a concern.\n\nNTA \n\nTry to see if a dressmaker can add something your daughter likes to make the dress unique: some embroidery/lace in certain places or a scarf/mini jacket with arms (don't know what it's called in English is just arms and short =long enough to cover the chest but no longer) depending on what model the dress is.", "As someone who had 2 or 3 other girls wear the same dress as me, and 1 of which was the same color even, your NTA. I would never bully a girl for that. And to be clear, that is what your daughter is doing. Bullying doesn't always have to be to the persons face. I would find it hard to believe that this girl hasn't heard what your daughter is saying about her. Imagine how the girl feels being talked about like that? Especially since she didn't do ANYTHING wrong. She needs to STOP this behavior right now or be grounded. Maybe even not allowed to go to prom. She won't be wearing the same dress as the girl then.", "Yeah there\u2019s only going to be so many different prom dresses. Unless you get a custom made dress there\u2019s always going to be a chance of duplicate dresses. I get it\u2019s disappointing but Juliet is going too far.", "I skipped mine to go LARPing. \ud83d\ude00", "Exactly, I get wanting to feel special and wear something unique but if you are shopping at big retailers someone else is bound to like the same dress and buy it. Save this level of drama for your wedding dress where no one else is guaranteed to wear the same dress lol", "I spoke with my daughter and she has no issues with her as a person. They truly barely spoke before then, not because they didn\u2019t like each other, but it\u2019s a big school and they don\u2019t have mutual friends.", "Awesome dad", "Is her friend group pushing her to slam this girl?  Or are the others ganging up on the the other girl?", "Read the update. That\u2019s exactly why she\u2019s still going. At the time of originally posting, it\u2019s because a part of me knew deep down it had to be more than just a stupid dress.", "NTA. Idk if I would let her go to prom with that bully attitude.", "For my prom, a friend, WHO WAS IN MY PROM GROUP, unknowingly bought n wore the EXACT same dress as I did. Very mellow lilac ballgown...", "NTA because I have to give a judgement. I really just wanted to say I saw your update and you sound like a really great dad. If your daughter isn't currently going, grief counseling might be helpful.", "Why do girls/women care what other girls/women are wearing?", "Just read your update.  You are a really good dad.  NAH.", "NTA. Your daughter needs therapy tho. Whatever her reasons were her reaction wasn\u2019t normal and just straight up bullying.", "Good job dad!", "NTA.", "You did good dad. It often isn't what it seems to be.", "Good update, and excellent parenting, dad. You rock.", "intimidate as if the daughter has not said anything to the other girl? I mean, op is NTA but her daughter is not harassing anyone, she doesn't insult her head-on and she doesn't send people to hit her or criticize her xd", "I went to my prom, but it was held in the history of pop museum so my friend and I spent none of our time dancing and we spent all of our time in the music rooms badly playing different instruments.", "you nailed it.", "Post-update:  Congratulations on leveling up your communication skills!", "NTA,\n\nPerhaps let her wear something that was her Mom's to Prom so \"mom is included\" in her milestone.  \n\nAnd if you have a photos of your late wife at her prom maybe have someone combine one of Juliet and her Mom. \n\nGlad you got some good advice here and figured it what the issue was.", "NTA but your update has me teary eyed", "Oh, hugs to you and your family. You are doing a great job, Dad.", "It seems like you\u2019ve gotten all the advice you needed, so OP, I just came here to tell you you\u2019re a great father. That\u2019s it. Thanks for being such a great role model to your daughters.", "No. You sound like an amazing father and man.", "I'm gonna say NTA.\n\nShe's still a teenager. She just needs to have a good time in the dress (which she liked from the beginning).\n\nDoes she have an issue with boys and their suits? Almost every guy wears the same looking suit (pretty similar).", "NTA. I dont understand why having the same dress as someone else is such a problem. Probably no one will notice, except for her friends maybe. Besides, it's no one's fault the fact they had bought the same dress, it's not like the other girl made it on purpose.", "You sound like a great dad!", "Hey. You're a good dad. You're doing a good job. Keep it up.", "NTA. but i seriously feel she is trying to play sympathy card to get away with her wrongdoing.", "NTA but if she keeps bullying that girl you will be", "NTA. It sounds like you did a decent job the first time, got more input, and went back and did a better job the second time. I\u2019m glad your daughter was able to eventually tell you what she was feeling. Hopefully she is using this experience to find better ways to manage her reactions.\n\nSide note: I am so glad my prom days were long before social media. Two of us wore the same dress in different colors, and I said, \u201cWe should take a picture together!\u201d I still think we should have.", "NTA, and you totally win the Dad award.  Well done.  I'm sorry for your loss, and your daughter's.", "Well done dad.", "Suggestion for the edit: Could your older daughter and you get together to pamper your other daughter a bit? Go to the nail salon or hair salon with her. Make her feel like mom is there in spirit.", "I realize it's \"not about the dress\", but maybe a local seamstress could do something to the dress--add some bling to make it literally ONE-of-a-Kind.\n\nIs there anything of your wife's that could be added to it?  Jewelry?  some lace or a blingy belt? something that could bring her MOTHER with her?", "NTA. Thank you for the update; I\u2019m glad you and your daughter got to have a heart to heart.", "Please demonstrate what she did that was bullying.\nThe only thing she said to the other person was to ask her to change her dress. The teacher said there was no bullying", "My kid's school did an IG group for that and I could see multiple colors of the same dress. Wasn't an issue bc it wasn't exact."]}
