The house is solely in my name. I am an only child and since I\u2019ve been born it\u2019s me, my mom and gran (90F) living together. In 2021 my partner (31M) has moved in and has helped a ton in the house, he has fixed what needs to be fixed. \n\nAbout 2 years now my uncle (64M) has been working for a company who is not paying him a salary. The entire family is aware of the situation but we were all told it\u2019s fine, the backpay will be paid by \u201cnext week\u201d and supposedly it\u2019s millions and millions, like I said this has been going on for just under 2 years now. Their house went on auction 3 times this year but luckily it\u2019s not been sold. The 4th time they weren\u2019t as lucky, their house was sold on auction due to them not paying the bond. My mom found out just as they were being evacuated and offered they can come stay with us until they get their millions. I found this out while I was at work. The next day they were in with ALL their belongings, 2 dogs and 2 cats. My mom offered them her room and my gran was moved to one of my aunts. My aunt works in an office, my uncle works from home and my mom is retired. \n\nThey have been in my house for over 3 weeks now. I have never seen someone consume so much coffee and food and doesn\u2019t clean after themselves, me and my partner have to clean the kitchen in the morning before we leave for work, come back after work, cook and still clean up after everyone has eaten. We will be in our room, where we are confined to now, and everyone will walk in to come see what the \u201ckids\u201d are up to. I am extremely frustrated, I am not allowed to say anything or else my mom and aunt are in tears. My uncle is breaking and changing stuff in my house without asking my permission to change it and if I get upset I get told I am being ungrateful. We were told everyday since they moved in that the money will be in the next day, so far nothing has changed. I have 7 rescue dogs of my own, all toy breeds and we make special food for them which includes veggies and brown rice. They have started to give their dogs our dogs food as well now. Nothing is asked, everything is just taken. There\u2019s been no contributions towards the house and I am being made out to be the biggest b*tch in the family now but no one wants to step in and help. My mom is my responsibility and I accept that, I feel looking after people in the family is my plight in life. My cousin also moved in for a year in 2019. My gran had 7 kids and no one wants to help her, so she became my problem as well. \n\nAITA for reacting the way I am currently and just wanting my own space back?", "created_utc": 1672082828, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvuolf/aita_my_moms_brother_and_his_wife_moved_into_my/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who said you aren\u2019t allowed to say anything & who made that person Supreme Commander in your house & your life? The time to say something was when they moved in, & you should have outlined your rules for their staying even one night & gave them a timeline for them to move out. Since that time is past, the next best time is today.  Let them know what they have to do - clean, stop taking your food & coffee, stop changing things around, whatever- and give them a week tops to shape up. As for your mom or whoever crying? Who cares.

You don\u2019t want to create a situation where they can stay for one second longer. \n\nCall a house meeting immediately after that. Tell them you\u2019re giving them notice to move out, and if they\u2019re not out by X date, you\u2019ll evict them. No negotiations on the date. Then give them that notice in writing, based on advice from your lawyer. \n\nTell them until then, you\u2019re creating a chore chart and everyone is going to chip in because you\u2019re sick of cleaning up after them. Point out how embarrassing it is for them to have to be told to clean in a house they\u2019re living in. \nAfter that, stop cleaning up after them. Or dump the dirty dishes in their room. You and your partner will eat off paper plates before you clean one more dish for them. \n\nTell your Uncle to knock off the changes. It\u2019s not his house - he doesn\u2019t have a house. Call him out every time: \u201cI said stop changing things. This is not your home. Stop ruining my home\u201d.

But you really need to stand up for yourself. Talk to your uncle, set a timeline when he HAS to be out, and follow thru no matter what.

You're being scammed.\n\nThis man of 64 years age doesn't have any savings. If he had a salary that would add up to millions (millions - plural!) over the course of two years he should be rolling in savings and investments. At the very least, given his age and supposed earnings, he should have a retirement fund that was sufficiently built up to last him and his wife until they died, which could bridge the financial gap of the loss of one earner's wages. They certainly wouldn't have lost their home due to lack of payment. If their story was true and they had any financial management skills they would have taken preservative measures to ensure that they didn't lose a major asset. They could have put some austerity measures on their lifestyle to lower their cost of living so they could survive on one earners wages, they could have sold their house before it was repossessed so that they didn't lose their equity and worked out a deal with their bank to put a hold on their mortgage payments until it sold.\n\nYou're being scammed. They're going to financially suck you dry and leave your withered husk in whatever pit they dug with all your money that they burned. How many \"next weeks\" are you going to hear before you come to the reality that this money does not exist.\n\nNTA\n\nKick out your uncle and his wife and their menagerie and any other dependents or entourage. Any other family that criticizes you can be told to take him in or take a hike. Sit down with your mom and gran and tell them that it is your home, they are not allowed to invite people to move in and that after this fiasco they now need permission even for overnight guests. If they don't want to live with this boundary they can find somewhere else to live. Your mom might have helped with your deposit but that has not bought her carte-blanche to do as she pleases in your home.\n\nI'm going to say it one more time so that you can act with clear conscious. YOU ARE BEING SCAMMED.", "Yta", "This!\n\nOP, it's a messed situation and maybe you are not used to being confrontational BUT instead of coming here to complain to us, internet strangers, do grow a good strong spine. You will need to evict them and set boundaries with your mother and grandma.
