You need to call a mandatory family meeting IMMEDIATELY and lay down the law. Give them a specific date for moving out and stick to it. Get your locks changed on that day and if they don't get out call the cops. You may hate confrontation but that's what's needed here. No excuses, no negotiations.", ">has been working for a company who is not paying him a salary.\n\nI suspect he's not actually working for any company.", "NTA\n\nI guarantee that they will deflect everything -\n\n1) You: pay some rent, please.  Them: how can you hurt someone in their time of need, what if it was you who needed help\n2) You: Clean up after yourself.  Then: we do, you just must not notice, and you make messes too\n3) You: Please stop stealing our dog's food.  Them: it's not a big deal, it's just dog food scraps and there is enough\n\nThey will not stop.\n\nDrive them to uncle's office and demand his back pay from his employer & 3 months of rent.  That will piss them off but hopefully put things in perspective.  Because the way you phrases it, I think you already know that there's no \"millions & millions\" coming in.  And if the money does come in, who cares?  Peaceful house & life > adjacent family $$$", "NTA\n\nYou need to lay down the law and remind them that under your roof it's your rules, and if they continue to violate them, evict them. Don't make idle threats either, kick them to the curb if they can't abide by the rules of your house.", "Kick their asses out", "You\u2019re being an AH to yourself and your partner by not evicting them.  You need to evict aunt and uncle asap before they\u2019re tenants and you need to go through the courts.", "I can tell from this reponse that you don't own a house and don't understand the first thing about the real estate market. \n\nIt would be ridiculous to sell the house to be rid of the uncle. That's stupid", "I think they might have meant to fib a little bit. Aunt and uncle don't have to know the house isn't actually up for sale. Whatever gets them out.", "Own it and paid it off three months ago.\n\nI understand far more than you do.  Thirty years will do that to you.", "It's probably the salty, broke, sucker uncle of OP, pay them no mind.", "Yes and no.  If in the the US, then there may be state-level eviction laws in play.  Getting them out on their own, could be very, very, very helpful.  Eviction can be messy.  Outright sale can be easier, but even better if they leave willingly.  If you can fake it, good for you.", "Can you imagine the questions that will be asked. That would mean lie after lie after lie. And then when the house isn't sold - what then?\n\nGive them 30 days to get out. It's that simple.", "NTA. Stop being a doormat and grow a spine. Kick those bums out. Let your mother know it's your house and she can't invite people to stay in your house. If she doesn't like it she can move out.", "NTA - time to accept you won\u2019t make everyone happy. Grow a spine and layout rules and what consequences there will be for breaking rules. \n\nMake uncles life less comfortable. For example, locks are cheap. Lock up dog food, lock up coffee, lock up toilet paper, put a locking box on the thermostat. \n\nRight now your uncle thinks his behavior is ok because he thinks he\u2019s in the power position with his promise of cash. Once you assert yourself be prepared for him to tell you that you will receive nothing.", "NTA. Evict them now - especially if you are in a state/nation where after 30 or 60 days in a place they get rights to stay there!!!", "Nta speak to lawyer find out what you need to do to formally get rid of them. Because you live there you may be able to kick them out very quickly.  Call a house meeting - formally tell uncle and aunt they need ro move out by x date, give them whatever documentation you need to. Tell mom and grandma that they may not understand this decision but it is not up for discussion. Ignore tears. If that isn't something they can live with they are free to move out. \n\nOnce the move out date comes, follow through with the eviction if needed. Make sure they fake all belongings and animals. Make sure you get your keys back, maybe get the doors rekeyed. The day after they have moved out sit mom and grandma down. Tell them that whilst they do live there they aren't allowed to invite ANYONE to stay or live there without your explicit permission. Remind them/inform them of general house rules-eveyone cleans up after themselves in a timely manner, other peoples property is respected (not used without permission, treated well etc), knocking on bedroom doors and waiting for a response is required (get a lock for your doors). Privacy is respected.  Etc include whatever you need to to ensure they don't devolve your home into madess again \n\nReread and saw that gran was moved to a different aunts house. Feel free not to move her back if you don't want.", "NTA. \nHow is your mom your responsibility? I'm sorry, but I can't with this. She's an adult. She isn't. We don't breed in this world to have someone take care of us when we're old, or do we? NTA but you seriously need to put boundaries in place. Eviction isn't a bad thing. If your mom gets upset? She's showing her disregard for you and your feelings, and then you should decide. Some family members, even if we absolutely adore them, are toxic and make us miserable.", "NTA... get them out. It will break you relationship. It will be hard on your mom but if she gives a fuss, offer to keep only Grandma. Sooner the better", "NTA Good luck with this, family is complicated.", "NTA- let them know (aunt & uncle) they have 90 days to either come up with back rent from this supposed \u201cmillions\u201d or they\u2019ll have 2 eviction on there records. Let your mother know she can either respect your rules & boundaries or she can leave with them. \n\n\nDon\u2019t forget to voice your reasoning for doing all this beforehand", "Came here to say that", "I have been promised money, and if I do get I\u2019ll be giving it to my mother, to pay off the deposit. But I\u2019m not betting on getting the money. They are extremely hesitant to get lawyers involved in this whole situation. But thank you for the advice, I\u2019ll definitely get this in writing", "THIS should be the top comment!", "Yeah I want to see that contract because I don\u2019t believe it at all and more than that, I don\u2019t think he believes it either. Does he work from (op\u2019s) home? What proof is there of a job? Phone calls? Trips? Emails? Packages? Anything?", "Depending on where she is, she may be able to sell for a huge profit", "But then she needs to get back in the market. And what will happen then? She'll give someone else a huge profit?\n\nIn this market, you really shouldn't sell without a very good reason. And trying to displace an uncle isn't it.", "No.  It's not.  You are obviously ignorant of the eviction process.", "The eviction process varies from place to place. Did the OP say where she lives?"]}
