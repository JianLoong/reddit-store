Our 12 year old biological son, our 8 and 5 year old adopted sons, and our 21 month old foster son. Our 22 year old foster daughter also still lives at home with us and my 19 year old son spent the summer back home after his freshman year of college. (We also have other adult children that don't live at home but not really relevant.)\n\n7 weeks ago, we got a call for an emergency placement of 5 siblings (17f, 12f, 10m, 7f, 6m). We only had 2 spare bedrooms but had enough spare beds in storage to make it work with the girls in one room and the boys in the other.\n\nIt now looks like we are going to be fostering the 5 of them for considerably longer than we thought when they were placed with us. Because of the large age gaps between the girls, having them share more long term isn't really ideal.\n\nWe already moved the boys a few weeks ago. We bought a triple bunk for our 8 and 5 year old's room and moved the 6 year old in with them, and put the 10 year olds bed into our 12 year olds room. This allowed the 17 year old girl to get her own room and the 2 younger girls to share. None of this created any drama and the boys were all more than happy to share rooms with each other.\n\nNow that my 19 year old is going back to college we discussed and eventually agreed on turning his bedroom into a room for our 12 year old girl so she has her own space away from her little sister. He wasn't impressed when I brought up the idea but agreed. However, before he left back for college a few days ago, he got into an argument with my husband complaining it's unfair he's lost his room and that he has nowhere to go when he comes back home now.\n\nMy other adult son also contacted me about the situation to essentially tell me it was a bad idea and that his brother is really upset and just because he's been away for college a year doesn't mean he is ready to lose his spot in the house.\n\nLast year we didn't need the extra space, so his room stayed empty when he was at college. This year it makes no sense to leave a bedroom empty and to make 2 girls 5 years apart in age share a room. He is still welcome home whenever and if things change (eg he drops out) we can rearrange things again. Losing his room is temporary as we don't normally have so many foster kids. When our other kids/grandkids visit they happily use an air mattress in the den or bunk with a sibling and he can do the same on his school breaks. He will most likely have his room back by next summer and if not, we will figure out solutions then. I have explained all this to him but he\u2019s not hearing me.\n\nAITA? I\u2019ve bought new d\u00e9cor etc for the room and plan on decorating and moving our foster daughter in tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1693851015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169za0o/aita_for_giving_my_sons_bedroom_to_our_foster/", "score": 872, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know my parents hosted a 7 year old underprivileged inner city kid for a summer once when I was about 4 through a program called the Fresh Air Fund. Instead of having him sleep on the folding bed from my grandmother's, they gave him MY BED and made me sleep on the fold out mattress for 3 months.

All i remember is him pissing in my bed every night, smearing his shit on the wall next to my bed, hiding his feces filled diapers under my bed, destroying my stuffed animals and eventually him nearly breaking my whole bed and shattering my bedroom window.

Where's he supposed to stay? The bath tub?  You, amongst other shitty things, are placing your bio kids well below all the fosters.   Your son is gone and won't be returning, guaranteed.    And just to be sure of that, completely dismantle his room and re-do it for some stranger.  Ugh.", "YTA your own biological children have to come first!", "I\u2019m torn. I\u2019m a foster parent myself, so I get how desperate the situation for some placements are and how hard it is to turn them down. I think where YTA is in accepting this placement to begin with. You\u2019ve clearly fostered long enough to understand that emergency placements can change to long term in the blink of an eye. Seemingly, there were one or two more kids in this placement than your household really allows when it\u2019s full. If you couldn\u2019t make the existing bedroom situation work, it was probably best to pass on this placement. \n\nAlso, I assume the 19yo also comes home for thanksgiving, winter break, etc, and thus still considers your house his home. At that age, that\u2019s reasonable. And if you redecorate his room, it\u2019s definitely not going to feel like home to him. Also consider that this young man has probably given up a lot of parental attention over the years\u2014it\u2019s the nature of fostering. Just the bare minimum of getting foster children to medical appointments, therapists, and parental visits eats up a Ton of time. He didn\u2019t ask for that, and I think certain allowances have to be made for his boundaries and feelings that maybe I wouldn\u2019t afford a 19yo who hadn\u2019t made those sacrifices. \n\nAs for what you do now? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a clear win-win. Is there another space you could fix up for the girl as a hangout/study space?

Our 12 year old biological son, our 8 and 5 year old adopted sons, and our 21 month old foster son. Our 22 year old foster daughter also still lives at home with us and my 19 year old son spent the summer back home after his freshman year of college. (We also have other adult children that don't live at home but not really relevant.)\n\n\r7 weeks ago, we got a call for an emergency placement of 5 siblings (17f, 12f, 10m, 7f, 6m). We only had 2 spare bedrooms but had enough spare beds in storage to make it work with the girls in one room and the boys in the other. \n\n\rIt now looks like we are going to be fostering the 5 of them for considerably longer than we thought when they were placed with us. Because of the large age gaps between the girls, having them share more long term isn't really ideal. \n\n\rWe already moved the boys a few weeks ago. We bought a triple bunk for our 8 and 5 year old's room and moved the 6 year old in with them, and put the 10 year olds bed into our 12 year olds room. This allowed the 17 year old girl to get her own room and the 2 younger girls to share. None of this created any drama and the boys were all more than happy to share rooms with each other.\n\n\rNow that my 19 year old is going back to college we discussed and eventually agreed on turning his bedroom into a room for our 12 year old girl so she has her own space away from her little sister. He wasn't impressed when I brought up the idea but agreed. However, before he left back for college a few days ago, he got into an argument with my husband complaining it's unfair he's lost his room and that he has nowhere to go when he comes back home now. \n\n\rMy other adult son also contacted me about the situation to essentially tell me it was a bad idea and that his brother is really upset and just because he's been away for college a year doesn't mean he is ready to lose his spot in the house.\n\n\rLast year we didn't need the extra space, so his room stayed empty when he was at college. This year it makes no sense to leave a bedroom empty and to make 2 girls 5 years apart in age share a room. He is still welcome home whenever and if things change (eg he drops out) we can rearrange things again. Losing his room is temporary as we don't normally have so many foster kids. When our other kids/grandkids visit they happily use an air mattress in the den or bunk with a sibling and he can do the same on his school breaks. He will most likely have his room back by next summer and if not, we will figure out solutions then. I have explained all his to him but he\u2019s not hearing me.\r\n\n\rAITA? I\u2019ve bought new d\u00e9cor etc for the room and plan on decorating and moving our foster daughter in tomorrow.\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Be real", "But only the *girls*.\n\nNotice she\u2019s trying to give all the girls their own rooms, but has 5 boys crammed between 2 bedrooms.", "There's home inspections to contend with (at least over here that's the case for foster parents). \n\nOP doesn't mention it either way, but in (almost) none of these stories of reshuffling spaces, I hear about the parents sacrificing their master bedroom... while that could be a good solution for the 6 kids under 10 (depending on the size of the master bedroom).", "The state of the foster system has nothing to do with the motivation for taking kids in.\n\nSome I'm sure have good intentions, but I'd wager more just want the money that comes with it", "They don\u2019t seem to have any interest in being their own son\u2019s parents anymore just because he\u2019s in college \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Or OP is just a really good person not kicking out a kid when they age out.", "They\u2019re choosing her over him just because he went to college", "They're not kicking him out! He's coming back during breaks and he'll have somewhere to stay. There's absolutely no reason to have a perfectly good room sit empty because he's away at college!", "It doesn\u2019t seem to matter whether they can support them or not since they were placed with a family that already had a full house.", "Let alone have the space or the willingness to take in a set of 5!!! siblings so they don't have to be split up and further traumatized!", "My older brother took in two boys.  Free healthcare and about $800 a month per kid.", "Yup. And a lot of student housing straight up shuts down for some of these times. Not mine, thankfully, as I went pretty far away (and I didn't want to go back all that much) but I'm not clear what the son's student housing situation is.", "So why is the 21 year old foster child still living there?", "Op said they are letting a 22yo former foster stay with them ..is that not also an adult?", "They even have a 22f foster \"kid\" living with them. Go figure!", "By that logic, the 22 yr old foster kid needs to get out as well", "Hes their flesh and blood. These temporary foster placements arent. He comes first in every situation involving the two.", "Oh! Gotcha. I thought it was that whole \u201cit\u2019s our money, he\u2019s an adult, he can pay rent if he wants a home\u201d or something.\n\nThanks for correcting me", "That\u2019s a lot.", "This is exactly what I was thinking!", "OP sounds like the spinoff version of \"Hoarders\"\n\nMaybe called \"Borders\"? I'm sure someone much more clever can think of something better\n\nBut yeah, she collects children", "I\u2019m surprised it took so long to find a comment talking about this.", "A 12 year old and a 17 year old are miles apart as far as development goes, in every way. I highly doubt it\u2019s comfortable to share a room with a preteen, never mind a 7 year old child too. They might have stuff like music they enjoy that overlaps, but as far as hobbies and stuff go, there\u2019s a very good chance they are not similar. Never mind that there\u2019s plenty of stuff that a 17 year old would be fine watching or reading or whatever that a 12 year old definitely should not. She deserves some privacy to be able to be the almost-adult she is, not stuck catering to the younger kids.\n\n\nI do think OP should leave the room as intact as possible for the son though. A little decor that\u2019s easily removed, new sheets/duvet and cover/pillows, that sort of thing is fine. Maybe even temporarily hanging some stuff on the walls. Some space for clothes, whether that\u2019s shifting stuff around in a closet or dresser or getting a clothing rack that can temporarily hold stuff. Don\u2019t repaint the room a new \u201cfeminine\u201d color (colors aren\u2019t gendered, I think that\u2019s stupid, but whatever). Stuff like collections/trophies/whatever? Leave those be.", "And their own 12 year old doesn't need those same considerations?", "Their own bio 12yo also lost his own room.\n\nIf you cannot provide for the needs of all of the children, don't take on more children. The foster kids alone would be more than most parents could handle, but they also have another bio kid, two adopted children, and a grown foster daughter. Nobody is getting what they need.", "What about Thanksgiving? Christmas? The odd weekend home? They also moved their s12 yr old son out of his room, so now two foster girls have their own room while the sons lost rooms. And how are her and her husband able to properly care for ten kids at a time. The fosters need extra time, I\u2019m sure, because of what they went thru. Im unconvinced that any of the kids are having their needs met.", "Or cares about the money she makes from the state. i'm surprised they let her house so many kids when it's obvious she doesn't have a adequate  facility.", "I'm sure the 12 & 7 year old are just happy to be in a safe and secure home. Every same sex foster siblings I have taken in have wanted the security of being together.

Most of the comments here are written by people who really shouldn\u2019t judge assholehood.", "They aren't his parents because they are letting someone use his room while he's not even there? That's bs. They have not written their son off at all.\n\nWhen I was in college, I thought it was wonderful that my parents accepted kids that needed help and gave them a temporary safe place. My parents were not foster parents, nor were they the best with my bro and I, but they learned to become more compassionate to the needs of others. It's the fact that they used my room to help offer help that really opened me up to respecting them as good people. When I would come home, I insisted on sleeping on the floor or a couch or whatever.\n\nParents that kick their own children out as soon as the kid is legally an adult are still considered parents, yet these people aren't just because they are temporarily giving these kids an unused room? The 19 yr old needs to learn some compassion and get over the adolescent \"me\" phase. Easier said than done, I know. But maybe if we actually cared about others, this world wouldn't be so shitty and sad. 19 is an age of many changes and personal growth. I will remain optimistic that he will grow out of this phase and contribute to society in a positive way.", "Except her own son of course", "That does not matter. Do not dump on their oldest child in the house just because OP is behaving badly.", "Yeah, he's going to get the totally luxurious air mattress in the living room of the house of 13 people. That's really a place to stay.\n\nHe's kicked out. And the other children's needs are not being met. That's selfish.", "320 hours roughly in 2 weeks. That's what, less than 10$ an hour.", "Oh i see, so we should treat children that arent ours like shit, while reserving space for an adult who doesnt even live here.\n\nWhat a crappy thing to say to a 12 year old girl.", "Okay then tell me, when the son comes back would the girl like to be shifted with a pre teen after living in her own room for a year? Isnt it better to do it from the start to avoid drama later? \nAlso no, i myself am 17 whose friends with many 12-13 year olds both girl and boys, only because our interest matched, also many friends who are my age are friends with people younger and older both. \n\nInterests can be music, games, and yes hobbies too. If the 12 year old is interested in something the 17 year old already knows, she can ask to be teached, which will grow their bonding. 12 year old is the age to get puberty, so she isnt a child completely. And you completey ignored the part of the son being uncomfortable with a younger girl staying in his room for a whole year, and also having to shift because of him which will most likely make the girl dislike OP's son.\nAlso do u really think there will be no changes in the room when living for a long time? Sure they cannot paint the room but shifting everything, from shelves, cabinets, bed sheets, clothes will be troublesome. \nAnd if they leave stuff, like trophies or other items, dont u think the son will feel like now he's living in someone else's room instead of his own room? Also i can bet it that the girl wouldn't leave the room when the son comes back home, and the son will be forced to stay in their parents room with the excuse of \"your only here for a few days\" basically prioritising some else kid over their own child. And if not prevented from the start, it will forever go on", "Which shows that her bio kids are least priority to her. Why get new foster kids, if you can't room existing ones properly?\nOp is kind of an AH.", "Crash on the couch or a temp bed on the floor if you're visiting.\n\nIt isn't \"your home\" anymore, you're an adult", "Yeah, this is what I was thinking, how is she allowed to have this many people in the home?", "> He will most likely have his room back by next summer and if not, we will figure out solutions then.\n\nShe has no intention of kicking him out.", "Multiply by 5\u2026.", "It's not about treating them like shit. They are getting no different treatment than they would receive elsewhere. Bio family comes first always.", "A little bit of inconvenience on his part to help other kids. Wish more people try to share those kinds of values with their kids.\n\nWorld would be a better place.", "You might multiply that by 5 but that's five more mouths you have to feed and those kids probably came with the clothes on their backs which means you're going to have to buy clothes. Don't even think that people providing foster care have money to just throw around. Where I am you can't be a foster parent if you can't prove financial stability first. It's not a money-making venture.", "BIO family comes first, even when they dont need it and someone else does.\n\nYou're ridiculous.\n\nSo if your family said they were hungry, yet someone was starving on the street, you'd say no?\n\nYour arguments are terrible.", "Yes I absolutely would. My family come first. Period. Thats true for almost everybody.\n\nYour arguments arent based in reality."]}
