Our 12 year old biological son, our 8 and 5 year old adopted sons, and our 21 month old foster son. Our 22 year old foster daughter also still lives at home with us and my 19 year old son spent the summer back home after his freshman year of college. (We also have other adult children that don't live at home but not really relevant.)\n\n7 weeks ago, we got a call for an emergency placement of 5 siblings (17f, 12f, 10m, 7f, 6m). We only had 2 spare bedrooms but had enough spare beds in storage to make it work with the girls in one room and the boys in the other.\n\nIt now looks like we are going to be fostering the 5 of them for considerably longer than we thought when they were placed with us. Because of the large age gaps between the girls, having them share more long term isn't really ideal.\n\nWe already moved the boys a few weeks ago. We bought a triple bunk for our 8 and 5 year old's room and moved the 6 year old in with them, and put the 10 year olds bed into our 12 year olds room. This allowed the 17 year old girl to get her own room and the 2 younger girls to share. None of this created any drama and the boys were all more than happy to share rooms with each other.\n\nNow that my 19 year old is going back to college we discussed and eventually agreed on turning his bedroom into a room for our 12 year old girl so she has her own space away from her little sister. He wasn't impressed when I brought up the idea but agreed. However, before he left back for college a few days ago, he got into an argument with my husband complaining it's unfair he's lost his room and that he has nowhere to go when he comes back home now.\n\nMy other adult son also contacted me about the situation to essentially tell me it was a bad idea and that his brother is really upset and just because he's been away for college a year doesn't mean he is ready to lose his spot in the house.\n\nLast year we didn't need the extra space, so his room stayed empty when he was at college. This year it makes no sense to leave a bedroom empty and to make 2 girls 5 years apart in age share a room. He is still welcome home whenever and if things change (eg he drops out) we can rearrange things again. Losing his room is temporary as we don't normally have so many foster kids. When our other kids/grandkids visit they happily use an air mattress in the den or bunk with a sibling and he can do the same on his school breaks. He will most likely have his room back by next summer and if not, we will figure out solutions then. I have explained all this to him but he\u2019s not hearing me.\n\nAITA? I\u2019ve bought new d\u00e9cor etc for the room and plan on decorating and moving our foster daughter in tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1693851015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169za0o/aita_for_giving_my_sons_bedroom_to_our_foster/", "score": 2765, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know my parents hosted a 7 year old underprivileged inner city kid for a summer once when I was about 4 through a program called the Fresh Air Fund. Instead of having him sleep on the folding bed from my grandmother's, they gave him MY BED and made me sleep on the fold out mattress for 3 months. To this day idc how much enrichment my parents thought they were giving this kid. All i remember is him pissing in my bed every night, smearing his shit on the wall next to my bed, hiding his feces filled diapers under my bed, destroying my stuffed animals and eventually him nearly breaking my whole bed and shattering my bedroom window.

Where's he supposed to stay? The bath tub?  You, amongst other shitty things, are placing your bio kids well below all the fosters.   Your son is gone and won't be returning, guaranteed.    And just to be sure of that, completely dismantle his room and re-do it for some stranger.  Ugh.", "YTA your own biological children have to come first!", "I\u2019m torn. I\u2019m a foster parent myself, so I get how desperate the situation for some placements are and how hard it is to turn them down. I think where YTA is in accepting this placement to begin with. You\u2019ve clearly fostered long enough to understand that emergency placements can change to long term in the blink of an eye. Seemingly, there were one or two more kids in this placement than your household really allows when it\u2019s full. If you couldn\u2019t make the existing bedroom situation work, it was probably best to pass on this placement. \n\nAlso, I assume the 19yo also comes home for thanksgiving, winter break, etc, and thus still considers your house his home. At that age, that\u2019s reasonable. And if you redecorate his room, it\u2019s definitely not going to feel like home to him. Also consider that this young man has probably given up a lot of parental attention over the years\u2014it\u2019s the nature of fostering. Just the bare minimum of getting foster children to medical appointments, therapists, and parental visits eats up a Ton of time. He didn\u2019t ask for that, and I think certain allowances have to be made for his boundaries and feelings that maybe I wouldn\u2019t afford a 19yo who hadn\u2019t made those sacrifices. \n\nAs for what you do now? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a clear win-win. Is there another space you could fix up for the girl as a hangout/study space?

Our 12 year old biological son, our 8 and 5 year old adopted sons, and our 21 month old foster son. Our 22 year old foster daughter also still lives at home with us and my 19 year old son spent the summer back home after his freshman year of college. (We also have other adult children that don't live at home but not really relevant.)\n\n\r7 weeks ago, we got a call for an emergency placement of 5 siblings (17f, 12f, 10m, 7f, 6m). We only had 2 spare bedrooms but had enough spare beds in storage to make it work with the girls in one room and the boys in the other. \n\n\rIt now looks like we are going to be fostering the 5 of them for considerably longer than we thought when they were placed with us. Because of the large age gaps between the girls, having them share more long term isn't really ideal. \n\n\rWe already moved the boys a few weeks ago. We bought a triple bunk for our 8 and 5 year old's room and moved the 6 year old in with them, and put the 10 year olds bed into our 12 year olds room. This allowed the 17 year old girl to get her own room and the 2 younger girls to share. None of this created any drama and the boys were all more than happy to share rooms with each other.\n\n\rNow that my 19 year old is going back to college we discussed and eventually agreed on turning his bedroom into a room for our 12 year old girl so she has her own space away from her little sister. He wasn't impressed when I brought up the idea but agreed. However, before he left back for college a few days ago, he got into an argument with my husband complaining it's unfair he's lost his room and that he has nowhere to go when he comes back home now. \n\n\rMy other adult son also contacted me about the situation to essentially tell me it was a bad idea and that his brother is really upset and just because he's been away for college a year doesn't mean he is ready to lose his spot in the house.\n\n\rLast year we didn't need the extra space, so his room stayed empty when he was at college. This year it makes no sense to leave a bedroom empty and to make 2 girls 5 years apart in age share a room. He is still welcome home whenever and if things change (eg he drops out) we can rearrange things again. Losing his room is temporary as we don't normally have so many foster kids. When our other kids/grandkids visit they happily use an air mattress in the den or bunk with a sibling and he can do the same on his school breaks. He will most likely have his room back by next summer and if not, we will figure out solutions then. I have explained all his to him but he\u2019s not hearing me.\r\n\n\rAITA? I\u2019ve bought new d\u00e9cor etc for the room and plan on decorating and moving our foster daughter in tomorrow.\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think this might just be someone with a big heart that can\u2019t see the negative impact this is having on her family.", "It makes me wonder how much he\u2019s had to sacrifice for the never ending barrage of foster kids that seems to come in and out of his house. I feel like if this was the first time he\u2019s been asked to give something up for these other kids he wouldn\u2019t be as upset.  I think OP needs to think about how her bio-kids feel about the current situation.  One or two foster kids would be reasonable, but it sounds like OP has moved in an entire baseball team into a house that is in no way big enough for the amount of kids she\u2019s filled it with.", "In my case, once I left and I was over 18, I was assured I would always have *a bed* but that didn't mean *my* bed. I lived with my parents twice as an adult, at 22 (with siblings) and 35, both under very different circumstances, neither time did I return to my childhood bedroom. NTA.", "Right? I'm 66 and dang I didn't even have my own bed until 7? I clearly  remember my own twin bed while my sisters shared a bed and we all slept in the same room, and my brothers had a bunk bed in a 8 x 10 room, and my folks slept in the other. Finally they enclosed the back porch and made a bedroom", "This family is not abandoning kids the moment they age out. That's a clue that they might be one of the good ones.", "Really bad foster carers don't ask if they are the asshole because they don't care. They are just in it for the money.", "I highly doubt this is the first instance this guy had to give up something for the foster kids.\n\nI think this is the final straw. Look I applaud OP's desire to help and not split up these kids and but they still have an obligation to their bio kids. And it's incredibly important to not let their bio kids feel that they care more about the foster's than them and it's incredibly easy for a kid to feel like that when you start bringing in other kids.\n\nI suspect this is less about the room and more that this kid feels that he doesn't have a place in his parents house or lives. That his parents don't consider him important they make room for these kids but not for him. To put it simply these parents make him feel that they don't care bout him.\n\nAnd imagine growing up hearing that all the time; every instance of wanting your own space, some time with your parents, is met with \"you have it better don't be selfish\". Your basically sending the message that their feelings aren't important.\n\nif this kid was 25 or had at least graduated and had a job I would say he was being unreasonable but a kid is not truly out of the house when they are in college. A dorm is not their home, it's a temporary dwelling.\n\nAlso, most families keep their kid's rooms until they graduate college and/or have a job. Lots of people have posted here where their parents, who didn't even have fosters immediately turned their room into a guest room or got rid of their room when they left for college and it made them feel like their parents were happy to finally be rid of them.", "I'm going to give college boy a bit of a break by saying that if he has routinely experienced being pushed out of the way by foster siblings he may be having an emotional reaction and feel he's losing his place in the family. It's hard for kids in families that foster if they feel like they're being shuffled around or expected to sacrifice for foster siblings - this might be a response to another perceived sacrifice. I'm not saying he's right or it's logical or reasonable - emotional responses often aren't.\n\nI foster, and have been a counselor for foster families. Many of the bio kids have experienced secondary trauma - they've seen some serious shit and been exposed to far more than their parents often recognize. It sounds like in this family the kids are expected to give up their space for foster kids - I doubt this is the first time this has happened. Some kids may be happy with it, others *need* to hold onto that safe space, and she's describing a situation where the foster kids are being prioritized for space. I wonder if college kid has had to give up that safe space in his family a lot in his life and resents it.\n\nSo, yeah. I don't anyone is doing anything wrong here, but the foster parents may want to step back and evaluate if they're able to do this after this sibling group leaves. 13 people in one house, 9 of them under 18, is too many for any pair of parents to manage, no matter how good their intentions.\n\nAnyway, yada yada, family dynamics are super complicated, people can be on opposite sides without anyone being wrong.", "So all 5 kids should stay together would imply they're family yes?  So why would it matter if the 12 yr old and 7 yr old share a room? ESPECIALLY if it was only for a short term period? Since apparently, the 19 yr Olds room would be available again by the end of the college year \n\nOn that note, OP could also make an addition to the house, build another room, or even just put a dividing wall in an existing large room to make 2 rooms to give the kids their privacy.\n\nWhile I understand OPs solution, there were surely various other options available if necessary", "But he may not; thats the thing when you fister and your own child feels pushed out it can be harmful. My classmate in elementary school to highschool had a mom who got talked in to doing foster care for kids with downs; at first it was just one and she was a fine toddler... Then it was suddenly three kids and her husband said I can deal with one or two but with the third it felt like she was pushing her own husband and son away. My classmate started to suffer in school and his Dad said I'm out and took his son and left. (He rented a condo a block over from where they lived) The foster agency found her a roommate to help her keep the kids, because she was doing such a good job, and it was Gods will she keep this up. There divorce took from 4th grade till we were in 8th grade (they ended up not getting a divorce) a judge ordered that Mom couldn't have more then one foster Child; she said that the poor Mom had been abused by the system; \"Oh, You do so well with one, and if you don't take the twins we will have to separate them!\" The twins by this point were going to a semi boarding school the state ran, and the frist kid was returned to her mother. And the latest was a drug baby nightmare who had to have methadone twice a day. The poor baby had a seizure while having a while at a visit with his Mom in Jail, he passed on. And this was 10th grade for us and my classmate hated his Mom at this point for loving every kid but him. She saw my Mom and I at the supermarket and she said, \"I just don't know why he hates me?\" I dropped the bomb on her, he felt unloved because of her putting her hard to care for foster kids frist. In all years that we've been in school together she never asked him why he was mad at her. I will she totally loves him He ended up failing out of college because he just couldn't, handle things and going home to her, always afraid that he'd lost his room to some kid that she had suddenly decided to foster.\n\n He just left. He didn't want to be a part of that life anymore. He's married now and adopted a kid... She's mostly normal, but I asked him why adopt. He said, \"I saw what the kids my Mom kept getting had to look forward to and my Mom never wanted to keep any forever when asked; she just wanted babys not kids who never grow up and have feelings an complex emotions. I wanted to take one who was not a baby and give them a home and loving forever family.\" He then told me him and his wife had just adopted the older sister up their first child. She's 12 and she's been in the system so long she can't even fathom what it's like to have people who will love her forever and not just a pay check or being \"the angel family\".\n\nMy classmate talks to his dad all the time but him and his mom they're never going to have a good relationship; She pushed him out snd apologizing or not she showed her cards.", "Literally just have the 12yo and 7yo share a room? Plenty of people do that every day. Maybe talk to the 19yo about allowing his room to be his room while he's there while also being a \"quiet space\" for the other kids who are sharing rooms, *including his own legal siblings*.\n\nSeriously, he's not advocating for them to be kicked out or even separated, he's sad he's being kicked out. All so that a 12yo doesn't have to face the horrible fate of... sharing a room with her 7yo sister for a time OP describes as temporary. \n\nBut, yes, validate selfishness. It's in his best interest to have a stable place to sleep if something goes wrong- like he catches mono or there's another covid lockdown- and it's in the best interests of the other kids to see they won't also get kicked out as soon as the foster agency calls.", "It's a no no in the US too.", "This was my first thought. Some peope hoard animals. Others, chidren.", "I'm glad you brought this up, because it's worth noting that there's a significant risk of abuse between children who aren't able to be properly supervised. Especially when many of them are teenagers who are essentially strangers to one another.", "Can confirm. I've adopted two through foster care (kinship placements). If I was willing, they would happily have given us more kids even though we had 5 kids under 5. Now that we've seen the need, I don't think we can avoid reopening our home once things are a bit calmer.\n\nI also know many, many foster families. Nearly all of them have 6+ kids. Our state doesn't limit total family size, just the number of foster kids per home. Kids who have already been adopted don't count toward the limit.", "It is when you take in 4-6 at a time.", "Pointing out that there is an easy right answer: 12f and 7f keep sharing.

She got a warning to use the bathroom before she was locked in for the night.", "As an adoptee, the fact that OP didn\u2019t simply say \u201cour three sons, ages 5, 8, and 12\u201d bothered me. OP\u2019s TA for even thinking having 10 kids under one roof is a decent environment. Whether she\u2019s doing it for the money or thinks she is doing it out of love, a chaotic environment based on numbers alone would not seem to a good fit for kids who need and deserve stability and attention.

I\u2019m not making an assumptions, but it\u2019s not at all unheard of for someone like the OP to start out with the best of intentions, but get caught up with being seen as a wonderful, selfless person who helps these poor kids when no one else will. *If* that happens, then it\u2019s *possible* that someone in the OP\u2019s situation could prioritize her need to be (or be seen as) the Angel in the House who selflessly ministers to others at the expense of her own well-being. The problem is that she might get so caught up in helping others that she isn\u2019t aware of the damage she\u2019s causing to her family.", "Even if the motivation was different the situation has become the same.", "Can you elaborate on what you do at Adult Foster Care? Like adults live with you? Or you help them find services? Or what exactly is that, if you don't mind sharing? I have my degree in social work, so that sounds reallllly interesting to me!", "That was my thought too. I knew a boy growing up who lived with foster parents and they supported him and past the age of 18 when they aged out of the system \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6.", "Actually it's not always the case that support ends at 18. At least in my state, you can get support for a foster child up to age 21 or as long as they're in college as long as they were in your home prior to turning 18, you continue to house & provide for them, and they choose to be there. (I think there are also qualifications related to being in a life skills prep course, but not sure of the details as I have only fostered preschoolers.) College tuition is often fully covered at public in-state schools as well. I know a couple of families who didn't formally adopt solely because it gave the teen a better college financial option than they could have provided themselves, and they can do an adult adoption later.\n\n\nBut that said, your point is correct that she is choosing to remain there (assuming she is capable of independent living.) That signifies that OP is doing something right by her.", "Exactly. A lot of people are assuming this is some spoiled kid who demands his parents keep room open for him when there are foster kids who need it more. And I have a feeling that he\u2019s deal with this a lot growing up, having to accommodate different foster kids and share his possessions and his parents\u2019 attention and not get things his peers might have because his parents are also caring for foster kids. His life probably hasn\u2019t been as good as it could have been in order to give a foster kids a better life than they would have had. And people could argue over whether this is good or new for ages.

To have a home cooked meal, because they love their family and miss them. This is often every 6 weeks. Where is this kid going to lay his head? Where will this kid\u2019s parents be as he struggles with mental health issues, gets COVID and is sent home, he may even feel he has to drop out to keep his spot in the family.", "Assuming they are siblings and that's why they needed to be kept together, and also going off OPs comment that the room thing is temporary (son would have it back next summer), what's the big deal about making the 12 and 7 year old share a room for such a temporary accomodation?  They're sisters yeah? And it's, what, a few months?\n\nI mean, I get it sucks, but the boys are all shoved together in their own rooms as well.\n\nOf which, OP has also already gone out and \"bought decor\" for the girls room, and the 19 yr old hadn't even left yet.", "You're taking a very narrow view of this. The kids may be expressing it as they don't want to give up their room, but it's much more likely they are already starved for attention and resources (love, advice, help with homework, quality time, etc) in the home.   To then have five more kids come in, who are absolutely going to be resource hungry, is a nightmare. Imagine FIVE foster kids coming in. Even if they are first-class kids, they are still going to be anxious, scared, untethered. They're going to need so much attention from the parents getting them acclimated to the home, the rules, getting ready for school, etc. And much more likely, they're going to have behavioral problems, possibly health issues - physical and mental - will probably bee attention-seeking (and who could blame them, they are going to want to feel loved after essentially being abandoned), and the list goes on...\n\nThen there sit OP's existing children who have needs of their own watching as their parents get absolutely consumed taking care of these other children. \n\nSimply put ,there is nothing wrong with the current kids not wanting this. Kids deserve to have parents who put their needs first. All OP is gong to accomplish is creating more kids with issues instead of being the heroine to the 5 incoming.", "But mum has the supplies to turn the d\u00e9cor of his room into a girls room.

Knock on wood, we\u2019ll never have another lockdown situation in our lifetimes, but a lot of kids were kicked out of dorms with virtually no notice (leaving some actually homeless) and I\u2019m sure that the ones who had a room waiting for them back home had at least a little less stress and worry in a very unstable time. \n\nAlso, I had to drop classes twice in undergrad. Once for recurring kidney stones (my undergrad had an unreasonable attendance policy) and once for mono. I was still at home with my parents full time since they were horrible people who didn\u2019t foster any kids and just let an *adult* in *college* take up an entire bedroom *and* a bathroom. I also had to drop a third time to when my mom had a stroke. \n\nI think your idea of a quiet room is a good one if he agrees.

Who were the fathers? How was this legal and did this not get the foster program a bunch of red flags?", "That's the rule here. That factors in how many kids are in the home total in addition to foster homes. It's true that they try hard to keep kids together, but nine kids under 18 in one home and two adults who have the home as their permanent residence (school is usually considered the temporary residence, with students having their home counted as a permanent residence) = 13 people living in that home, plus a rotation of other visitors.\n\nI'm a foster parent and a pediatric therapist. OP, I know you probably have the best of intentions, but that is a *lot* of children to try to manage, especially given that many of the children probably are coping with emotional or behavioral issues. I know how hard it is to say, \"I can't and need to prioritize the welfare of the children I have\" when you get that phone call, but it is not possible to give kids the attention they need when you have so many. You're already out of room. I know I would not be allowed to have three children per room if one is a foster kid.", "This was also true for my family. We finished the basement to create more bedrooms, another bathroom, and a TV/game room before accepting a sibling group.", "This seems like a really smart rule. I'm sure there have been emergency times where it feels like this rule is too strict, but generally, I imagine it's to stop a situation like this, where there are too many children in this house to fit and not enough adult management to make sure all the children are properly cared for.", "she did mention they have an adult daughter living in the home. it's quite possible that they had her licensed.", "In England it is a full bedroom per child. No individual bedroom, no foster.", "I work at an Adult Foster Care Home! I\u2019m direct care staff, so I basically read the behavior plans created with social workers and psychologists for each resident and make sure they are following them. Kind of like a guide. I dispense all medications, do safety monitoring checks, assist with everyday tasks, transport residents to events and appointments, and basically just hang around as someone they can talk to about anything they need. My home is an all-women\u2019s home, I take care of 6 people that live there full time. \n\nSome Adult Foster Homes are more like nursing homes. They house disabled adults that have no one else fit to or willing to care for them. Mine is more of a rehabilitation center; our goal is to teach our residents how to be independent to the best of their ability. We receive a majority of our people either from aging out of their previous situation, or from the legal system (oftentimes they have a disability that gets them in trouble, and are deemed unfit for jail/prison). We house them until they are able to move out on their own, or move to an independent-living situation where staff only visits them. So rather than wiping butts (which does happen sometimes), I\u2019m usually just helping them maintain routines and keeping them company. \n\nMy girls are all \u201chigh functioning\u201d if you want to call it that. They have things like schizophrenia, substance abuse disorder, borderline personality disorder, autism, IDD. My oldest is the one who requires the most assistance because she is more like a 3 year old. But the majority of my girls are in their 20s. So my typical day is comforting whoever is feeling down, coloring with everyone, smoking on the back deck, reminding everyone of their chores, and cooking. I really love it a lot, but the hardest part is the stories.", "And striving to give the teenage girls their own room. A cruel foster would wedge them into a closet.", "I'm not saying the OP isn't doing her best - it sounds like her intentions are good but she's falling short on execution - but taking a large sibling group is no indicator of being a good foster parent.", "Yeah, if it was five random foster kids, I would be skeptical, but being siblings, that's much more understandable. It also doesn't sound like it's expected to be a permanent foster-adopt situation, like with the older kids. I mean, yes it sucks for the bio-kid temporarily, like for the holidays and spring break, etc, but this time next year, they probably won't be around. Being a foster kid sucks.", "This is a fair take. If they genuinely thought it was only going to be for an extremely short time period, that changes my opinion quite a bit.", "I couldn't find the words to express it, but yeah, you're spot on with that. OP really shouldn't have taken these 5 kids in, at least not all of them. I get that it's damn near impossible to keep 5 kids together, but OP doesn't have the room, and with all the other children, there's no way the kids in the home already won't be neglected. It also seems like the girls are being favored over the boys that are all getting by with being shoved together. Maybe that's just how I see it, IDK. It's great that she's a kind hearted, but it seems like the other children's concerns don't matter much.", "Look into it? College kids have dorm rooms for a semester at a time and are expected to vacate on breaks and summers. Where is this kid supposed to live at thanksgiving, Christmas and summers?", "That's a great point. It's just a really bad situation.

Once COVID hit they really ramped it up. Investigators came but wouldn't go on the house because of the virus. They were a nightmare to live next to. Boys would climb my fence too get on their roof too the girls bedroom. One time a guy was literally beating a girl up and the mother got mad I called the cops. Told me to mind my business and wouldn't let them in her house. Just disgusting people", "I knew a family growing up that had 9 children - 4 biological, 5 adopted. 4 of the adopted kids were under 4 years old at one point. The girl I was friends with was 11 or 12 at the time and the second oldest child. The oldest child was 16.\n\nInitially they had all these 9 children and two adults in 3 bedroom home. Eventually they moved to a farmhouse, and things got a lot better in terms of space, but it was bad initially. And yeah, it did bad things psychologically to the older kids. My friend had essentially become a mom at 11 years old. She completely lost any and all sense of privacy - the only space she had that was \"hers\" was *maybe* her bed for a very long time. At one point her bedroom had two triple bunkbeds with barely any space between them. Clothing was kept in the garage.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, my friend grew into a really amazing person, but I also think it could've gone the other way. She had a significant portion of childhood stolen from her and was responsible for a lot of childcare, cleaning, and cooking responsibilities. And do you think the parents possibly had enough time to give each child the attention they individually needed? The dad worked full-time, and the mom had health issues.\n\nI know OPs situation is different in some ways, but I agree with you that sometimes you need to learn to say no in favor of the wellbeing of your current children. And don't get me wrong, I both admire people who want to foster, and think the 19 year old is being unrealistic (they're just supposed to not use a room that won't be occupied for basically the next 9-10 months straight when they have that many kids in the house???). But you have to realize when you just don't have the resources to responsibly accept more kids.\n\nEveryone applauded that family I knew for being 'selfless' and frankly it always kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Yes, it's awesome to want to give a home to kids who don't have one. But if they wanted to adopt that many, they probably should've had less biological kids. If they were living on a farm/large home and had multiple adults beyond the parents who enthusiastically wanted to raise these kids, too, it might be a different story. But that is not the case here.\n\nThis ended up being a NOVEL so I don't blame anyone for not reading this lol. I considered just deleting it all, but meh.  \n\n\nETA: Saw another comment saying emergency placements are meant to only be a few days, maybe a week. If that's what OP was expecting (and then things went differently), that does change my opinion quite a bit.", "And the 22 years old *might* be the third licensed adult", "On the one hand, it definitely makes sense from a quality of care standpoint.  On the other, it virtually guarantees that sibling groups larger than 2 or 3 will be inevitably split up.\n\nHonestly, the only real solution is having more families (and especially more families with either one or no children) being willing to foster children.  Even for those who are willing, it's a real ordeal to become verified, and fostering kids is not for the faint of heart.", "That is certainly true, but I think of how I\u2019d have fared if separated from my older sibs and cringe. I would bet those older two kids are fill in parents for the littles. If I were a foster I\u2019d leap burning bushes to keep sibs together.

The 19 year old may not have words to express it, but he may be emotionally needing to be able to come home to his own room with his parents. Will he be in the same space after another year of college? Probably not, and then it wouldn't matter so much to him.  They and he do need to figure out what he's going to do over the summer, because what is tolerable for a couple nights over a holiday weekend is less so if you do it for a couple months on end, and it's easier to work out \"going home with my roommate over the summer\" or \"doing some summer coursework\" ahead of time."]}
