This dress looked nothing like the dress we all liked but I didnt want to make a fuss.\n\nFast forward to now, there is 1 month left till the wedding, the bridesmaids dresses have arrived and the back of the dress is so low that its impossible for me to hide the back of the bra in this dress. I have told the bride that either an additional piece of material will need to be added to the back of the dress to hide my bra or I will have to attend the day in the dress but the bra showing.\n\nI don't want to make her life more difficult but I will not be comfortable not wearing a bra.

Boob tape was one such alternative but I do think they had other stuff as well, I think I saw something like a bra that didn\u2019t even have a back. It was kind of like boob tape but still also a bra but completely backless. The reviews seemed like it was legit as well. I\u2019ll have to look up and find what they were called. \n\nMaybe go ion Amazon and look at different bra alternatives? Go on google and search for the best kind of alternative to bras for women with very large breasts like yourself. They have articles for everything now, especially for us women so I guarantee you could find an article specifically for bra alternatives for large breasted individuals who need some support but have to wear a dress or something that requires you to have no straps or even the back showing. \n\nThey probably have reviews for the different kinds and will recommend the best option for comfort, style, and if it actually works or not. You may have enough time to order a few different options and try them out before the wedding?\n\nOh btw NTA like at all. Neither is bride. She probably forgot about your request for a dress with a bra in all honesty since it\u2019s been a year and she\u2019s got so much on her mind right now. I bet if you\u2019d reach out to her and explain your situation she wouldn\u2019t mind you altering the dress and adding material to the back if that\u2019s what will make you comfortable. You all sound like you\u2019ve got a pretty good friendship and you\u2019ve been amazing about all of the last minute changes! You\u2019re willing to put your comfort aside and even have your bra visible just to not cause an issue for your friends wedding. You are very kind for that but I\u2019d say bride would understand your situation. Maybe y\u2019all can go on Amazon together and look for alternatives and then have a day where you try them all on for her and she gives you her opinion on what she thinks looks best? \n\nWho knows you may even find something you really love wearing that\u2019s comfortable and actually works. It could open up your wardrobe to whole new cute shirts and styles because that cute backless top you loved but would never wear because you couldn\u2019t wear a bra with it, now you can! And you will still have the support your gals need!", "NTA", "NTA I think it\u2019s pretty low maintenance to only ask that your undergarments not be exposed at a gathering. I think some things are compromises - I\u2019m not comfortable wearing sleeveless with my religious past so my friend immediately offered a nice wrap for my arms so she could have the dress she wanted and I still felt modest. Will she let you do that if the dress can\u2019t be altered?", "NTA. I\u2019ve declined being a bridesmaid before for this very reason. I\u2019m a 34G and no outfit is happening without a bra. I even wear a soft one to bed. I feel for you!", "NTA. She knows. You explained the issues a year ago. She's been friends with you probably since before the issues arose (sorry, couldn't resist!) You've made repeated efforts to get a dress she likes that won't have free-range breasts attracting undue attention. You are not the problem.\n\nA piece of matching fabric to cover the bra is probably best/easiest. If not, fabric that matches your skin tone. Speaking as an amply endowed person, she has no grounds to object to either. Especially since she's not telling you what she wants. You are a bridesmaid, not a mind reader.", "NTA. \n\nI think your best option, if it's possible, is to have a piece of fabric sewn across the back of the dress. A good alterations pro can do it in a way that it's not obvious what it's there for. \n\nMy second choice would be to wear a coordinating shawl to cover the back. It could be pinned or tacked (sewing term, no pushpins involved) to the back of the dress, if necessary.\n\nIn either case, your dress will look different than the other bridesmaids, but that doesn't seem to be an issue. I've certainly seen wedding parties where one or more of the dresses has been modified to better suit a member's body.\n\nAlternatively, buy the ugliest bra you can find - extra points for a loud, clashing color - and just let it show. \ud83d\ude1a", "NTA - she needs to be accommodating.

You made your request clear and are entitled to wear a dress that you are comfortable in.", "NTA - I'm a FF and feel your pain.  Extra fabric/a shawl/a stole/a matching bolero would all be options if the bride is willing to compromise. \n\nIf she's adamant, *and you're willing*, and the front of the dress will let you get away with it, you may be able to construct a boob\n-restraint with tape for long enough to survive the ceremony and photos, and then change completely/slip on a bra with a pretty back-band, but it really is a AH move from her to mess the bridesmaids around like this.", "NTA.

I was a 36HH (US sizes) myself (until reduction) and used to work in a bridal shop. It hooks down nearer to the waist so back can be bare and has boning/shaping in front to hold up \"the girls\". They come in a huge variety of sizes and you can typically get the basic style/color without breaking the bank. If you can't find any online I would contact some bridal shops and ask. Don't count on sizing being exact so you will want to try on first. And some cover more back than others.

Her bridesmaids all have very different body types. This dress will be flattering on slim and curvier silhouettes. She put thought into it on her own and showed me the dress, telling me the specific reasons she chose it. She asked all her bridesmaids if we would be comfortable in it, and if any one of us had said no, she had a backup dress in mind.
