And if people don\u2019t support that decision then don\u2019t listen", "I would've wanted to send it all back to the bride and say, 'Sorry, but I can't afford this.  I'll have to bow out of being a bridesmaid.'", "NTA. Bride seems like a piece of work.\nWhen I graduated I used a thing to pull my bra strap down so it wasn't seen. Maybe that's an option if everything else fails? Either way you deserve to wear something you're comfortable in.", "don't they make a strapless bra that is long and low in the back for dresses cut low?  I don't remember what they call it.   Will that work?  Assuming you can find one in your size?", "NTA. I was in a very similar situation and I looked absolutely awful in this dress, everyone actually laughed in the shop when I tried it on. Even the shop owner said this lady cannot wear this. Nope bride was adamant I was wearing it so I bowed out. The bride was paying for dresses (U.K.).", "Honest question from someone who can't comfortably fit into 34DDs anymore but where the hell do you get E cup bras?!
