I was overjoyed and happy to be one. She told us from day one that she didnt care the style of bridesmaid dress we got as she wanted us to all be comfortable in our dresses but she did want it to be either a soft lilac or champagne colour dress. Brilliant we thought! The only request I made to the bride is that I have a dress where I'm able to wear a bra. My bra size is 34H and ive had a child so they arent \"perky\" anymore and considering she wants us all to be comfortable I dont think that's a big ask.\n\nFast forward we go to a wedding dress/bridesmaid dress store and try on dress we all liked and thought suited us, we gave ours sizes as was told by the bride not to be concerned if they didnt fit perfect as they would be custom made to fit. We left the store feeling great.\n\nOver the past year the bride has changed her mind an additional 5 times in regards to the dress, changing it to one colour and we all have to be in the same design dress. Now all the bridesmaids bodies are a range of shapes and sizes. \n\nWe met up again and chose a design we all liked and felt comfortable wearing (including myself as it allowed a bra) and gave the bride our measurements.\n\nA few months later the bride messaged us telling us that the shop she was buying the dresses from now didnt do that particular dress anymore so she made the decision to select a new dress. This dress looked nothing like the dress we all liked but I didnt want to make a fuss.\n\nFast forward to now, there is 1 month left till the wedding, the bridesmaids dresses have arrived and the back of the dress is so low that its impossible for me to hide the back of the bra in this dress. I have told the bride that either an additional piece of material will need to be added to the back of the dress to hide my bra or I will have to attend the day in the dress but the bra showing.\n\nI don't want to make her life more difficult but I will not be comfortable not wearing a bra.  If i knew the dress would be like this from the beginning I would of bowed out of being a bridesmaid.

I\u2019ve also seen bras where the back is translucent.  I wouldn\u2019t stress about it if not. Talk to the dress shop and see if they have any advice.

At least then it will be a smooth strap visible at the back, rather than a clasp.\n\nThere\u2019s something to be said for going bold with a visible bra - that tends to be my approach - so something like this could work. Front clasp, 34H, and a really pretty back - very visible but that can be a lot better in photos etc than an obviously out of place bra strap. \n\n- [lilac 34H front-clasp bra](https://www.bravissimo.com/products/dana-bra-lg242/#lilaclemon-lg242lln)", "NTA\n\nI'm also an always wear a bra person and while I was able to choose a bra-friendly bridesmaid dress, I was worried about the straps shifting and showing so I was able to buy a bra that was the same color (or close enough) to the dress.\n\nMaybe something like that would help make it less noticable?

I am also well endowed and can't stand being in seen in public without a bra! \n\nAnother thing you could consider is sister sizing and alterations to a backless bra- if they go up to a G cup a 36g would be a sister size to a 34h (the cups are the same volume). If the cups fit you can get alter the band-take off an inch at each size so it fits!", "NTA. That sounds like a nightmare. That's why I stuck with \"wear whatever navy blue dress you like.\" I ended up with 2 very beautiful bridesmaids who felt amazing.

If OP was comfortable using those this post wouldn\u2019t exist. She wouldn\u2019t have asked for a bra friendly dress at the beginning. A wedding with less than a month to learn to use it AND get comfortable with is an u reasonable ask. \n\nYour friend knew your needs for you to feel comfortable to participate.
