Pregnancy hormones or not I wouldn\u2019t give you one stick of furniture. You owe your in laws an apology.", "YTA.  Toughen up butter cup.  Being a mom is going to a lot tougher.", "Soft YTA, OP, I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I\u2019m 28 weeks with twins. I\u2019ve had plenty of people tell me how \u201csmall\u201d I look even though I\u2019m dying inside. Or, I feel pretty freaking huge and uncomfortable. Pregnancy is hard, hormones make it harder; but you have to learn to take what others say with a grain of salt. When you do pop, people will notice and comment then too. \n\nI\u2019ll share an example: I had my 28 week scan on Wednesday. Both babies are estimated at around a little over 3 pounds each. I said this to my mom who responded by saying \u201cwow! No wonder you popped!\u201d I brushed it off and moved on. Apologize to your spouse and MIL.", "YTA and yea hormones make you sensitive, after about 2 months if showing you will miss not showing. I was 120lbs when i got pregnant with my first I barely showed until almost 8 month mark then I blew up. Everyone commented how I didn't look that far along and even \"are you sure you're pregnant\" comments. There aren't meant to be hurtful just an observation. You can apologize and let her know you've been sensitive about the subject and why. She will understand.", "NTA it was a pretty rude thing to say.", "NAH. It was probably just your whoremoans causing you to be emotional. It does not seem that MIL had any ill intentions.", "Soft YTA\n\nSorry darling, you overreacted.", "With all the other horrible MILs I have seen on other posts, OP YTA.  She asked how you were doing and probably thought you would be flattered by the bump comment. It was a simple misunderstanding she apologized for and you overreacted. I don\u2019t think it was necessary to say more than what she said.", "YTA\n\nThat comment wasn't offensive at all. I don't know your MIL at all, but I'm 100% sure she didn't mean to offend or hurt your feelings. I think you overreacted, because that's just a general comment people say.", "I\u2019m usually ready to crush MILs, but honestly many people would think they were giving you a compliment when they said such a thing.  I know you are delicate right now, but if you can practice a little emotional generosity, it will make life easier. NAH", "To be fair, a woman's emotional state is all over the place during pregnancy. It could be that she was trying to give you a compliment by saying you don't look very big and you took it the wrong way. This being your first pregnancy, it's hard for you to gauge how things are \"supposed to\" be, but as you said every woman carries differently. I disagree with the poster who said toughen up. It's not a case of you being a wimp or in any way weak, it's just that you took the comment differently than was intended. You're not naive, of course you know motherhood is going to be hard. I think both of you could've handled the situation differently. Perhaps give her a call this weekend to clear the air, and maybe ask her for some advice regarding some aspects of pregnancy you're unsure of. Every woman has different experiences, and they all have something to contribute when you feel overwhelmed by all that's going on in your body. I'm going to say both the AH, to an extent. Well-meaning comments can be taken wrong when our emotions are already crazy.", "I've not been pregnant, being a dude, so  I can't really put myself in your place. But I'm failing to see in an objective sense how what was said is particularly insensitive. You tell us that your bump is not noticeable. She commented that your bump was not noticeable. So in a discussion about pregnancy your MIL identified a physical characteristic of your pregnancy. \n\nShe didn't criticize your diet; she didn't suggest your pregnancy was abnormal in any way. She noted that you don't have much of a bump. You note that too. \n\nIn my opinion, every pregnancy will be a little different; some women will be huge, some not. Assuming everything you're hearing from your health care providers is positive, does the size of your bump at any given point really matter? It's not like you have to 'prove' you're pregnant or that bigger bumps equal better babies... \n\nI gotta go YTA.", "YTA. I mean you are waaaaaay too sensitive.", ">it\u2019s never okay to comment on how someone is carrying their child because you DON\u2019T know how they\u2019re dealing with it. \n\nWhile I would *ordinarily* agree with this, it seems highly illogical that you would be offended by someone telling you that you *don't* look pregnant. And it's not like your MIL made a joke about it; she apologized and told you she didn't mean to hurt you. You definitely overreacted. YTA.", "YTA - It sounds like you\u2019re upset at larger societal issues in regards to pregnant women and just decided your MIL is the scapegoat for your feelings. She said something that upset you, you let her know, and she apologized. I don\u2019t know what else you expected to happen there. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings and insecurities, but you can\u2019t make those feelings someone else\u2019s priority.", "YTA. In the land of insensitive comments about one's pregnant body \"you hardly have a bump\" is breezing om the freeway, never even drifting towards the turn off.\n\nUnless there's more going on with your family/Mil, this is fairly harmless comment from a family member. Unless there's no /r/JUSTNOMIL stuff going on you haven't mentioned, this, makes me feel sorry for your in laws having to walk egg shells around you", "NTA. People need to stop commenting on other people\u2019s bodies. Pregnant or not\u2026", "YTA you completely overreacted and she certainly didn\u2019t mean it as an insult or to hurt you.", "I never wore maternity clothes. I had our kids when I was 5 and 6 months. Very few people even knew I was pregnant. Get over yourself. More important things to think about.", "YTA. Let\u2019s put this down to pregnancy hormones", "YTA.\n\nShe literally complimented you by telling you you're not fat, and you took so much offence to it that you stormed off on Thanksgiving?\n\nJesus Christ. I feel sorry for the father of the baby.", "YTA. You made a big deal out of nothing. It\u2019s not insensitive to say someone isn\u2019t showing..", "YTA- nothing said was harmful or malicious.  Your feelings got hurt oh well!  I would\u2019ve taken it as a compliment that I haven\u2019t gained a bunch of weight being pregnant.", "Why are you upset?  You got offended by a offhand comment. She apologized and your still offended. Like whaaat?", "Gentle YTA.\n\nWhile I agree people shouldn\u2019t comment on your body this was already resolved before you left.\n\nThis is a sensitive issue for you. And while that should be respected your reaction was too big for the transgression.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy!", "Sorry but YTA. Your MIL and husband are acting nonchalant because this was a totally innocuous situation that you ended up blowing out of the water. Yes, it\u2019s insensitive to comment on other people\u2019s bodies, regardless. But the fact that she was saying you were NOT showing would probably be taken well by most people (because a lot of women get insecure about the weight gain from pregnancy), so she might not have expected this would be a sore spot for you. When you told her it bothered you, she apologized. What more was there to do? Grovel at your feet? That seems like an open and closed conflict that was resolved maturely at that point.", "NAH.\n\nJust because you aren't showing, doesn't mean you aren't effected by the pregnancy. So I find it a strange comment to make in the first place. She did apologize after you explained to her the comment hurt you. So that was a good move from your MIL.\n\nLeaving a situation, because you got hurt, is always better then staying and saying something hurtful back. You decided to leave and give your emotion a place. When you go back to your IL, just tell you MIL that you had to leave to give your emotions a place. With hormones you are just more emotional.\n\nNeither of you were an AH. Both of you did the right thing at the time.", "Soft YTA. She made a little comment you didn\u2019t like. You explained to her that you didn\u2019t like it. She said she had no intention of being hurtful and apologized\u2026this sounds like a well handled conflict resolution to me. What else was there to be done?", "Very gentle YTA. I agree it\u2019s not ok to comment on someone\u2019s body. And I have 100% felt what you felt. It may get worse. Since I\u2019ve been 6 months I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m \u201cbig\u201d or \u201chuge\u201d yet I\u2019ve very much been average. My SIL called me a bowling ball the other day (I\u2019m now 9.5 months pregnant).\nYour MIL didn\u2019t mean harm. After you told her she hurt your feelings, you could also tell her to respectfully not comment on your weight. Then hopefully she doesn\u2019t do it again. \nI can\u2019t understand why people can\u2019t keep their comments simple \u201cyou\u2019re looking great!\u201d", "YTA - not for being offended (pregnancy hormones) but for walking out. Sometimes people say things!! MIL didn\u2019t say anything conventionally offensive here, and she apologized. Sounds like she was trying to compliment you. Do you have a history of being offended over small infractions?", "YTA it doesn't sound like she said it maliciously. Not sure why you feel you need a bump to show you are pregnant. You'll have many months where you'll wish the bump will go away and your body would return to normal.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t say anything hurtful. Wait till you start showing, people will comment on your baby bump.", "YTA. Your mother in law wasn't being nasty. You're just overly sensitive. Would you have liked it better if she'd called you a whale?", "YTA you should stay away from social situations if you are this sensitive about what people might say. It would be a nightmare to walk on eggshells around you until you give birth.", "You are letting your insecurities damage family relationships IMO. I don't mean to be harsh because we all have insecurities, but being butt-hurt over an innocent comment from a family member and leaving was rather childish. Am I correct in understanding that your MIL is giving you furniture? Giving you.", "I didn\u2019t show until I was 8 month pregnant! Even then I only looked maybe 5-6 pregnant when I gave birth. Women at my work would occasionally ask me if something was wrong with the baby. It\u2019s rude to comment of pregnant bodies. They are all different and just because you are small doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have a whole a$$ human growing inside of you. When I was tired people would ask me why. What do you mean why?? I have the same crazy hormones and changes happening to me too. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA but I don\u2019t think your mil meant to hurt you. \n\nNTA", "Dramatic, woe-is-me-ish. YTA", "Mild YTA. When I was pregnant with my second child I had no bump, when he was born I took him to pick my older son up from school and a few of the mothers asked me who\u2019s baby it was. They were shocked to hear he was mine because \u201c you didn\u2019t look pregnant, was it a surprise when he was born ?\u201d. I had to say that I knew I was pregnant but had no bump.", "YTA", "Soft YTA. You're pregnant, so it's a normal comment to make. However, hormones  are at play and tend to being insecurities to the surface.", "YTA...but I mean that as kindly as possible. It's okay to be sensitive, but at the end of the day you have to realize that no harm was meant in a single observation.  You can say, \"I'm really sensitive about that actually.\" These are family members, not random people on the street.", "Soft YTA - I've been pregnant 3 times and can totally relate to feelings of anxiety and insecurity over comments made about my body. It is inappropriate to comment on a woman's body and how she's carrying while pregnant. But on the other hand, this was a very minor infraction. It was not intentionally to hurt you. You let your hormones take over and made a mountain out of a molehill. Perhaps you should have taken the opportunity to sit down with your MIL later that day and explain.\n\nI've had friends who didn't show very quickly get insecure about how the baby is growing. This may be whats triggering you. If that's the case, open communication would have been best.", "YTA Says this 8 month preggo. That was not an offensive or mean statement at all. Everyone comments on baby bumps. And then she apologized! Wtf else did you want her to do! For real, what EXACTLY did you want her to do? Just stand there after already apologizing and what? Continue apologizing until the end of time? What?", "YTA - I came here expecting to be on your side. However, I think that you are just being sensitive because of hormones or something. And she did apologize as soon as you told her that it bothered you. So I think leaving was def an AH move.", "YTA. If someone says something that clearly isn't meant as any kind of insult, then yes, it is rude to act like it's the end of the world. Who cares if you don't show as much as other women? Every body and every pregnancy is different. Letting yourself get caught up in comparing yourself to others is only going to hurt *you,* and as you can see, it's going to cause issues with other people who don't mean any harm. If you want to be sensitive go ahead, but keep it inside your head when it's obvious that no offense was intended. That's a skill that's part of being an adult.", "Very gentle YTA.\n\nI\u2019m currently 24 weeks pregnant. Like you, I only have a noticeable bump with certain clothes. I\u2019ve received countless comments on how \u201cgood\u201d I look and how I\u2019m barely showing. Do I wish my bump was a bit bigger? Sometimes. But I know that most times, people are saying it because they think it\u2019s admirable in some weird way. Hormones have you all over the place when pregnant, but that doesn\u2019t make it acceptable to ruin a holiday over it.\n\nRegardless, I know they don\u2019t mean any harm. You can gauge whether a person says something with malicious intent. I doubt that your MIL had ill intent considering she was letting you all take a gander at their storage unit. You owe them an apology for overreacting, especially since she did apologize. She was probably confused.", "YTA", "She did apologize, but then walked off while I was still visibly upset. She didn\u2019t try to understand why I was upset in the first place, and that\u2019s why I left. Because I felt like it was pointless to argue.", "yeah, i can see op getting miffed, but to be *so* offended that she needed to leave is an overreaction.", "Whoremoans??? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, i know people shouldn't generally remark on other people's bodies, but this comment seemed quite harmless. \n\nFrom what I can tell OP seemed to think MiL was commenting on her weight, like 'oh, you can't see the baby bump bc of the fat'. That's not what she said and I think OP's own insecurities are making her hear it that way.", "I agree with the judgement and made the same one myself, but I did want to clear something up. It is valid to be upset by comments about NOT showing as much as others. Usually it's related to a fear about the baby's development. \n\nI've made this mistake with friends who were much smaller than me. I assumed it was a compliment until they told me their baby was measuring small for gestational age and they were sick with worry over their body not providing what the baby needed to grow. It really opened my eyes to another side of things, as I've always been that woman who gets told *\"Are you sure it isn't twins?\"* so I assumed smaller pregnant women had it easy.", "I expected her to be more concerned about why I was upset to begin with, instead of basically saying \u201csorry, I didn\u2019t mean it like that\u201d and walking off. Her apology didn\u2019t feel sincere.", "It\u2019s insensitive to comment on someone\u2019s body regardless of wether they are pregnant or not.", "Having a noticeable bump from your child growing inside you, and gaining weight are 2 completely different things.", "It\u2019s not a sense of wanting to have a bump to show I\u2019m pregnant per say, I feel like with how far along I am, I want something to show for it. I\u2019m 6 months pregnant, and other women just as far along as me look completely different. I know that it\u2019s normal, but it doesn\u2019t make me not wish I were carrying differently.", "And how big/small it is. If its twins and are you sure cos of its size... then the unwanted touching of said bump...", "I know this is a sore spot for you, and i understand that. But if that's the harshest thing being said to you you are still having a good time. This is my second pregnancy and people have just flat out called me names or really insulted me to my face. And did not apologize after.\n\nI don't understand why you would want to argue with her about why you are still upset. I'm sorry to be so blunt but this is more of a you problem then it is a insult of your mil.", "It was pointless to argue, because you're wrong.", "She said something that wasn't a big deal and she apologized, but she didn't grovel enough.", "The difference here is that your friend explained her concerns to you without freaking out and storming off like OP did. Her reaction was way over the top and out of line.", "Thank you for the info. I wouldn't have correlated the two.", "So you\u2019re upset that her level of remorse did not match your level of hurt. Her apology sounds perfectly valid unless she flipped you off as she strolled off towards the horizon. This is something you need to let go if this isn\u2019t some micro aggression from a larger issue with the in laws. They seem supportive and are giving you free stuff, why are you digging in so much?", "Your MIL is NOT from the generation of don't comment on anyone's body. TBH, I'm an elder millennial and my generation is not of the don't comment. Your MILs generation? I'm guessing probably Gen X? Even late boomer or early millennial are in the same boat. Her generation was told to hate, loathe, and fear fat. Fat on bodies, fat in food. Pregnant women hated being pregnant because their bellies growing made them feel FAT, if their ankles and feet swelled they felt FAT. They were jealous of women who didn't show or had tiny bumps. To them, telling a woman she isn't or is barely showing is like a compliment, like telling someone they look like they have lost weight. Your MIL was probably really confused and caught off guard if you haven't had any conversations with her about how self conscious you are about your lack of showing. Sometimes your hormones while pregnant will make you overreact to the smallest of things. This is one of those times.", "You're blowing this way out of proportion. She apologised, but you wanted a deep conversation dwelling into your feelings and insecurities, and your MIL wasn't there for that. For the level of offense in comment, her level of apology was appropriate.", "I agree with that, and I was ready to be on your side, but from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most asshole thing she could have said, this was at a 2 or 3. I do think you over reacted.", "So, are you mad at how your body is  carrying the baby? Sister, you need to grow up and get over being offended over non-issues. When your mother-in-law tells you that you look like Miss Piggy when you are 7 months pregnant then you will have a legit complaint.", "Being told you don\u2019t look pregnant is not an insult.  Sometimes people who carry extra weight prior to being pregnant don\u2019t show as much as a thinner person.  You\u2019re being overly sensitive.", "I didn\u2019t have a bump till I was 34 weeks, you overreacted and just seem overall like an unpleasant person to deal with YTA get over yourself", "It sounds like the issue isn't what your MIL said, it's your personal feelings about your current shape. She unintentionally hit a raw spot. I understand where you're coming from, but what she said was pretty normal and she apologized.", "So your baby is probaly up your back so its just how you are holding the baby and no one is wrong for saying your not showing not everyone does.", "I didn\u2019t \u201cpop\u201d until late into my pregnancy and it was overnight. I\u2019ve also known women who are taller pregnant with their third child in less than five years that never really showed where most women would really be showing on the third pregnancy. One friend that has had two in three years looked very pregnant the whole pregnancy and you can only imagine the comments she received about how big she was - her daughter is so petite. \n\nEveryone is different in how they carry their pregnancy. I\u2019m sure you look beautiful and radiant. Don\u2019t let how you wear your pregnancy bring you down. The fact you are pregnant and you and your baby are healthy is most important. Enjoy this time and ball up the comments and throwing them away."]}
