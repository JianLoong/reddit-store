You\u2019re not communicating the issue to your fianc\u00e9 very well and jumping to the last resort. The issue is that his brother is openly flirting with you and trying to seduce you away from him. This is wildly inappropriate and makes sense why you would be uncomfortable, but you need to deal with it, not just pretend you can send his brother away.\n\nTell fianc\u00e9 that he needs to tell his brother to cut it out. That he is not allowed to invite himself over (if it happens again, lock the door and tell him it\u2019s too late to come in but you\u2019ll call him a taxi) and should not even hint at having feelings for you. Fianc\u00e9 needs to be the person dealing with this, and if he doesn\u2019t see it as a big deal you should not marry him.\n\nYou\u2019re marrying a man who is SIGNIFICANTLY older than you. He is supposed to be more mature than you. If he can\u2019t be your advocate in this case, I would worry that he\u2019s one of those older men who get together with younger women who match their maturity level better (ie, refusing to grow up). Which would mean you\u2019ll outgrow him in 3-5 years. Consider this a test of his adulthood: will he do what\u2019s mature for your sake or will he do what\u2019s easy?", "INFO: Your fianc\u00e9's brother hits on you every week and you've never told him?", "NTA but Girllll!

Dude has been walking into YOUR home where YOU live, and you\u2019re just opening the door and letting him right in. And then when you talk to your husband about it and he minimizes, you go from zero to break-up in like 2 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you\u201d shouldn\u2019t be the answer you jump toward if you\u2019re not just looking for excuses to leave anyway.", "Why does this man have a key to your place?

You\u2019ve been hiding all the things BIL has been doing and saying, and then you threw this at your fianc\u00e9 as a fait accompli without all the context.  It was the point where you hit your limit.  But you had already long blown by the point where you should have been raising your concerns, so I\u2019ll spell it out.  This is your fianc\u00e9s problem.  Anytime your BIL contacts you, texts you, says anything inappropriate or concerning you should tell your fianc\u00e9.  Put it in a text so he can read it over and over.  You should never let the BIL in the house when the fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t there.  Period.  Instead of letting him stay and sober up, you should have booted him head first into an UBER and texted your fianc\u00e9 (with photos).   Your BIL is deliberately doing these things when your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t around, and you need to cut that sh** off.   If you do all that and your fianc\u00e9 still doesn\u2019t support you, then he\u2019s TAH.  \n\nSide note: are you absolutely sure you want to marry a guy who is that much older?

If you are thinking of canceling the wedding all because he wants his brother (who you didn't bother telling him about until NOW) at the wedding, then maybe you know you shouldn't be going through with it. The man is 16 years your senior. That's a few years shy of doubling your age.", "NTA, but in your fianc\u00e9s defense, this probably seems very out of the blue because you didn\u2019t tell him of all the behavior leading up to this most recent event. You need to sit down and tell him everything.", "NTA - but this sounds like a very bizarre dynamic. Why does the brother have easy access to your home? He has a home of his own and is using your place as his, clubhouse? I guess. It also sounds like there is some jealousy going on, the brother is either interested in you or is upset that his brother is no longer going to be single. I just don\u2019t know. YOu need to communicate better with your fiance and frankly, cut off access to your home to your BIL.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve told your fiance what was going on from the beginning.

To him, his brother is just upset or jealous he\u2019s getting engaged and he probably believes with time the idea will sink in and it\u2019ll blow over. This is more common than you can imagine. When I got engaged, my fianc\u00e9s cousin was upset because she\u2019s much older than him and single, making her the last one left that isn\u2019t in a relationship. Later on she got excited about the wedding. \n\nFrom what you\u2019ve written, it sounds like the future BIL has a thing for you. Which is not okay. \n\nInstead of going from zero to 100, try talking to your husband.", "ESH - you can\u2019t expect your fianc\u00e9 to have an understanding of his brothers behavior if you downplay it, you need to stop letting him barge his way into your house and you shouldn\u2019t threaten to break up with someone if you don\u2019t mean it", "ESH.    \n\n\nYou are too immature to get married to anyone.

The brother should not be coming over when your fiance is not there.

Minor asshole for not taking your concerns more seriously.", "NTA but clearly the brother has feelings for you. Either that or he hates you for taking his bro away from him.

In the blink of an eye, you went from not wanting to tell your fianc\u00e9 about his brother\u2019s behavior to threatening to call off the wedding if he invited his brother.

The dynamic his brother has with you is utterly creepy, & your fianc\u00e9 should be a lot more concerned about it. Given the fact that he just basically told you he's okay with his brother making you exceedingly uncomfortable in your own home whenever he feels like doing it, I'd be rethinking the wedding on other grounds than just whether his brother is invited or not. Like, do you *really* want to spend your life with a guy who just brushes off *anyone* acting like that toward you with a 'Ha ha, what a card! Well, that's just how he is.'", "Girl, don\u2019t marry this guy. You\u2019re still a baby. I\u2019ve dated guys older than me, from 4 years to 12 years. The guy 12 years older than me was a bunch of red flags (I was 22, he was 34), and when we broke up, he would call and leave me childish voicemails calling me horrible names. He even got his new girlfriend\u2019s 2 year old to say something inappropriate and laughed about it in the voicemail. They want someone to control. You\u2019re still young. And it\u2019s likely the brother realizes the icky-ness of the situation and is trying to talk sense into you, even if he is going about it the totally wrong way. \n\nESH", "YTA \n\nI was with you until I realized that\n\n1- The brother didn\u2019t actually \u201clet himself in,\u201d you did\n\n2- You felt uncomfortable with the brother, but somehow kept allowing him inside your place when fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t around and then didn\u2019t even put any effort to voice the problems to him\n\n3- You blindsided your fianc\u00e9 with ultimatum without any prior communication concerning this issue\n\nObviously, the brother\u2019s behaviors is unacceptable, but the way you acted was pretty immature and rash", "YTA.\n\nThis is a cumulative issue and you only are telling him the tip of the iceberg. To him, this sounds like his drunk/hungover brother said something dumb out of jealousy. To you, this is a pattern of behavior of him being unsupportive of your relationship and it sounds like you're also alluding to sexual harassment - if you haven't shared that with your fianc\u00e9, why would he automatically kick his brother out of the wedding?\n\nYou're also TA for threatening to cancel a wedding if you don't get your way, which again as far as your fianc\u00e9 knows this is over something small.

It sounds like you and your fianc\u00e9 have some serious communication issues that you need to sort out before you get married. Ultimatums aren\u2019t healthy, expecting him to cut-off his brother isn\u2019t healthy, but it\u2019s not healthy that there are no boundaries for his brother\u2019s behavior either. It\u2019s concerning that you don\u2019t feel empowered to decide who comes into your home, especially when you\u2019re there alone. Also, going for a drive when you\u2019re upset is a fairly immature way to deal with conflict, especially if he doesn\u2019t come back to talk about the issues like adults after he\u2019s calmed down.\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re marrying the right person nobody can \u201cruin\u201d your wedding.

If a mutual friend is rude to you when you're alone and super nice in front of your mutual friend, you know she's aware she's bullying you.
