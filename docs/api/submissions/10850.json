Every once in a while, Amy would spend the night at my house after class (or after a night of drinking) because I lived walking distance from campus and she lived over an hour drive away.\n\nIn January, Amy and I made plans to attend a weekend long school-sponsored conference. The conference wasn\u2019t until March, but it was out of town so we needed to book flights and hotels right away.\n\nTo save money, we booked our flights for 5am the morning of the conference. We booked our flights out of the airport near my house, because that was also the cheapest airport to fly out of. Since Amy lives so far away, we decided that she should spend the night at my house the night before our 5am flight. We booked everything in January.\n\nAs January and February passed, Amy started acting weird. She would get super jealous of me in school; for example, she told me, \u201cthe only reason the men in our group voted for your project proposal is because they think you\u2019re hot.\u201d (Which, tbh, is partially true. I am hot and well-liked in our program, but I\u2019m also very creative and hard-working in group projects.) After several rude/snarky comments toward me, Amy and I got in a huge fight about this particular group project. She ended up quitting our group because she felt that she could do a better project by working alone. She was really mean about it, too, and accused me of being a bully and a sociopath. I started to feel nervous around her, so I stopped engaging her almost completely.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t spoken in over two weeks when it was time to attend the conference. The night before, she texted me to confirm that she will be sleeping at my house. WHAT?! I didn\u2019t realize she was still expecting to stay with me because she had previously accused me of bullying her. And, like, if it were me, I wouldn\u2019t want to touch my aggressor with a ten foot pole, let alone voluntarily sleep at their house. So obviously I said no. After I denied her, she proceeded to tell our classmates that I screwed her over and that I\u2019m a sociopath.\n\nIt definitely sucked for me but I\u2019m trying to understand if it also sucked for her and if I should have done something differently. I didn\u2019t give her a heads up, I just assumed she wouldn\u2019t want to stay with me without communicating my own discomfort surrounding the situation.

Is she like this with everyone?", "NTA. \n\nYou have no obligations to her, especially now that she isn't your friend (for whatever reason, it doesn't matter).\n\nShe lives an hour away from your house and I am guessing the distance to the airport isn't anything crazy either. Many people travel 1-2 hours to reach their nearest airport, so can she.\n\nWhat could have been done differently, from both sides, is to communicate about the logistics of the conference, since you both knew it was coming and that your dynamics changed. You could have told her that she wasn't welcome at your home anymore, and she should have made sure about her way to the airport, way before the night before the flight.\n\nIf I were you, I would stop talking to her and to tell your side of the story to your friends. Let them make their own mind. Apologise for the miscommunication but since she's calling you a bully and sociopath (and doesn't act like a friend anymore), you assumed that the sleepover was cancelled, and that you are not comfortable having someone like that over.", "NTA.  \n\nIt was totally reasonable to assume that the person who just accused you of being a sociopath wouldn't want to sleep at your house.  It was very weird for her to assume that after she called you names, quit your group and ghosted you that you would suddenly be happy to welcome her into your home.  She is not stable.  Give her lots of space.", "NTA. You  don't have to let people stay over at your house if you don't like them.", "YTA. This was a school conference, practically a work event. You can have a falling out with your coworkers and still stay together for a work trip. So you expect her to drive across town at 3 am? Definitely A-holeish. Just be mature about it.", "That\u2019s a good point. She ended up staying with a different friend in the area and we all made it to the conference just fine so it shouldn\u2019t have even been an issue", "I\u2019ve been doing this and it truly works. Being accused of assholery really just made me even less of an asshole haha", "This is good advice. Stay clear of her, and yeah, she sounds stalker creepy.", "Yikes that\u2019s a scary thought", "Ok Amy", "I mean the way you put it, obviously NTA. However, if it were me, I would have told her to make other plans the moment I decided that her comments crossed a line. But I\u2019m traumatized from years of poverty.", "NTA", "This is complicated by the fact that initially, before the fall-out, there had been an agreement that both would stay at the OP's house before the flight. But, \n\n>you expect her to drive across town at 3 am?\n\nIs that so unreasonable? Many times have I got up at 3, 4, 5am to get an early flight or train.", "Good advice, but OP probably also assumed the deal is off (which is also reasonable). Didn't think anyone with common sense would want to still sleep over. But people can sometimes surprise you."]}
