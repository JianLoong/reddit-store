The survey actually showed that in that major city, black people were actually more racist than white people.", "NTA. Racists are racists, no matter what their skin tone is. Be proud of yourself for standing your ground for someone you care for and cares about you. \n\nBut also, your dad seriously needs some credit where credit is due. Throwing away your whole family for someone who isn\u2019t blood related that needed help and being a father for them is an unimaginably difficult decision, which it sounds like it was a decision he didn\u2019t hesitate to make. You and your siblings, especially your brother, are very lucky to have that in their lives.", "NTA! Your family is stuck in a time warp. Their bigotry is rooted in their limited experiences. Thankfully, your brother does indeed have a family that loves him regardless. No need to subject yourselves to nonsense and uncomfortable family visits that result in insults and BS.

Your way was passive-aggressive, and it's a shit way to interact with an old person, whatever the reason. You brought the conflict up too indirectly. Too many times. And too many times without really asking permission. They gave permission for a conflict once, when they proposed to \"correct\" you. They didn't die that day. You had it out. Why did you keep mentioning the estrangement in passing? Trying to continue a conflict because people around you are uncomfortable is wrong, and cruel. You can't change negative feelings quickly. It seems to me that you just don't like your extended family, so I don't really know why you kept visiting them.", "Reassure your brother you are not going back because of him. \n\nYou are not going back because of them\n\nHonestly, being around people who do that kind of stuff is tiring.
