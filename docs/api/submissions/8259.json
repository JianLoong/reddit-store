The problem, and the point of contention for me, is that I wasn't going to the bedroom to get anything. At all. I just got done heating up leftovers for us for dinner, we ate, and I sat down to watch a video I wanted to see. She sits down next to me, frustrated that she forgot her charger in the bedroom, and just asks that question.   \n\nI tell her that I wasn't going to the bedroom, **edit:** *(INFO: she then asks why can't I just help her and get it? I tell her I'm not going to the bedroom at that time) then tell her* the question phrased that way just comes off the same way a backhanded compliment does, and it's more of a demand padded with a question.   \n\nShe personally wanted two things from the bedroom but didn't want to get it herself, so she demand-asks me to get it. When I told her I wasn't going to that side of the house right now and I'm going to watch this video, she huffs and puffs about me making a big deal about just helping her out and doing her a favor.   \n\nWe have a little back and forth about the question, trying to explain both of our points of view. She says it's just her asking for two things at once. I tell her it's not, and if she wants to ask for two things at once, a simple \"hey, would you mind grabbing X and Y from the bedroom for me?\" would suffice as opposed to \"hey, go get X and while you're doing that, can you grab Y?\".   \n\nShe eventually gets frustrated and just goes gets them herself. Before anyone asks, yes I absolutely cater to my girlfriend. More so than she does me, honestly. But the phrasing of the question, the way and timing it was asked, just didn't sit right with me and made me feel like she was demanding me to do it. \n\nI don't know, Reddit.

Her demanding things when you already feel you cater to her more than she to you is not okay. \n\nThis is minor, but I'd definitely have a conversation with her about how the demand vs asking makes you feel.

I personally don't see anything wrong with the question, it just sounds like you didn't want to go get what she wanted from the bedroom, which is fine, you're allowed to say no. Arguing semantics over \"the way she asked\" is super ridiculous. From someone in a very long term relationship, that shit really never matters and is usually a sign that you're holding resentment underneath.

It sounds like she doesn't treat you with a lot of respect, and based on her expectations, she speaks to you like this often.

Did you want the blanket too?\"\n\nPeople are treated the way they allow themselves to be treated.    And from what little I know, it seems like she's used to having you do a lot for her, so she probably assumed you would just get the blanket when you figured she wanted it.   You need to train her how to ask for what she wants in a way that it is not a command or expectation.

Is she behind on the favour total so you have to give her a hard time? 'More than she does so me' sounds pretty resentful.\n\nMost people don't parse every sentence through formal logic, so things that sound roughly the same mean roughly the same things. 'Can you go get the blanket, and when you do go get my charger' is a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the statement. People in couples generally assume that small favours, if asked, are granted, which is the assumption baked into her phrasing. You're not Gottlob fucking Frege. \n\nI'm honestly kind of mad at myself for even parsing this deeply enough to respond. If you want a girlfriend where you play tit-for-tat word games on technicalities, well, that's a life choice I guess. I wouldn't put up with it.", "I'm torn, and first thought Y T A but I'm going with NAH.

And he turns off my TV and the lamp. I've got a good 5 min warning from the time the pills kick in, the time I'm going to fall asleep wherever I land, and usually, that's just enough time for PJs and teeth brushing.   \nTHAT'S a solid marriage. I never asked him to do any of those things. He just realized they need to get done and kindly began taking care of them.   \n\n\nI thank him profusely of course, but I also do a ton for him so it feels quite even in our marriage.", "Yeah me and my partner also just do stuff for each other without asking and *gasp* sometimes neither of us say please and *gasp* even more crazy! Sometimes we'll ask the person who just sat down because the other person is warm in bed. Relationships are about doing things for each other out of love and saying thank you and please is certainly important but the gesture is even more so. To argue about wording when there was no cussing or yelling or angry tone is just.... so strange. Like why fight over something so silly when you could just have a healthy conversation and then just get over it.", "Jesus get over yourself, this is so small potatoes  they didn't demand and this is a normal dynamic for sure for anyone with acts of service as their love language.", "Lmfao you\u2019re telling on yourself as to how you think is okay to behave in relationships. people who have acts of service enjoy for things to be done for them yes. But even as a love language demanding to be served is not a thing that is acceptable. \nYou\u2019re the one who needs to get over yourself if you think your love language is an excuse to treat someone like a servant.", "Bro you can't be serious... demanding is like \"hey you go and get me that blanket right now!\" And yelling and carrying on. That certainly doesn't seem like how his SO was acting and in the scheme of things this fight over semantics is no big deal. If you think this is even remotely a concern to act like the word police in relationships then you seem overly sensitive and I'm sorry for you."]}
