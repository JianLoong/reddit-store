I truly believe that many problems in a relationship can be worked out and forgiven, but the thing that distinguishes what can be fixed with what can't is the willingness of both partners to take the other seriously, to care about what is important to them, and to be humble in working towards a solution. When one partner says 'that's upsetting to me' and the other tries to assert power to get their way - in this case by telling his Mom who he could predict would try to be his enforcer against OP- there is clearly no willingness to try or care for what his partner feels. This is a person who is used to reaching towards whatever advantage he can leverage to get his way in a conflict with his partner. Of course, he may have been raised that way and it's worth several conversations to see if he can gain awareness and seek to change.

My current (2nd) husband expressed that he wanted me to take his name.

You also really need to rethink this relationship if this is the way those 2 are going to act over something as small as this.", "NTA, we had similar convo with my fiance and I wasn't sure whether I wanted to change my name.

Your bf needs to grow up.", "NTA Back when I got married it was certainly most common to take your husband's name. And that was okay. I have missed my maiden name at times but it's actually still there if I wanted to insert into things. I got married before all the big things got attached to my name (college degree, loans, mortgages, publishing articles, etc....) so it wasn't a big deal on having to change things. Now that a lot of women are waiting to marry and have many accomplishments attached to their names, it would be a pain the butt to change. And, many women just don't see the necessity to take their husband's names. My biggest thing would be having the same name as my kids. But even that could be worked out and compromised on maybe. It sounds like you two need to have many more discussions before setting the date. I really advise doing some pre-marital counseling to help. It really does help to get a couple on the same page and to set a good foundation.", "NTA, I never changed my name when I got married for sentimental reasons (but reasons are irrelevant, if you don't want to change your name, don't change it). My husband and I had a discussion about it and he was taken aback at first, but understood my reasons. It had never occurred to him I wouldn't change my name, since that's just something \"people do\".  We discussed it a few times and when it came up with his family, I never had to explain myself, he spoke up for me (I also lucked out with my in laws, but my point being, he acted like a partner not an adversary).\n\nYour name is your name. You get to decide what it is. Keep your name or change it, it's up to you. Your BF is allowed to have feelings about it, but he should recognize that this is a decision you get to make.

Unless you have no credit, no passport, no driver's license, no social security number, unless you have no official identity in your name, changing your last name is a pain in the butt.

It\u2019s not abnormal and frankly I think the assumption that the man is more important and thus his name prevails is patriarchal and gross.", "NTA. At least you are seeing who he is.

Run girl run!!", "NTA - I relate to changing the last name to something I wanted and not wanting to change again if married. She shouldn\u2019t have assumed you would been want their last name and it\u2019s really not her concern anyways. She sounds like a possible pain and he shouldn\u2019t be upset about it either.

Every woman in my family older than me who changed her name told me not to do it, that it wasn't worth it.  I had never intended on changing my name anyway.  My name comes from my grandfather, a Polish immigrant and WW2 veteran, and I'm proud to carry it.  Also, like, it's my name, the one I've carried since birth.  \n\nWhen my husband and I got married we just both kept our own names. The only people who had issues with this were his mother and Gen X sisters (who had taken their respective husbands' names).  Literally no one else cared.  Out of all my married female friends around my age, most kept their own names.  One took her husband's because she associates her given name with her abusive father.  One took her husband's name because she is a bit more \"traditional.\"  One took her wife's name (when in their relationship my friend is more traditionally \"masculine\" and her wife is more traditionally \"feminine\").  Multiple friends have used both names, so Sarah Smith becomes Sarah Smith Jones.\n\nOP can do whatever the hell she wants to.  It's her name.  It seriously boggles the mind that men think women should change our names but they're not willing to do the same.", "I personally don\u2019t really care about changing names that much if she wants to change her name great if she doesn\u2019t also great if we want hyphenated great or I change my name whatever it isn\u2019t that big of a deal just talk about it", "I wonder how you'd feel if you met someone who had the same attitude? Do you both change your name to your spouse's? Basically swapping names?", "Even without this issue it\u2019s just a massive PITA", "This is probably one of the reasons why in Germany your ID HAS to have your maiden name on it.", "everyone has dealbreakers and that's one of mine. we would go our separate ways since we are incompatible."]}
