I knew he was a project manager and that was it. A lot of you are acting like this is some huge detail about your life but for us, we just didn't talk about work. My job does not define me and it didn't define him either. We've shared about our upbringings, our traumas, our struggles, all the experiences we've had, and all the fun hobby stuff we have in common. We knew so much about each other but I guess we skipped a basic one. He had my address but always wanted to stay at his apartment because he's downtown near the bars and I'm in the suburbs. \n\nI didn't deceive him into thinking I was poor. I told him about my weeks spent abroad, my expensive hobbies like 3d printers or woodworking. He's dumb af for not figuring it out sooner. \n\n_____\n\nI (34F) work in support and that's what I tell people. I don't like talking about work so I usually leave it at that and most people don't really ask anything else because then I ask about them. I've been dating a guy (32M) for 5 months who insisted on paying for everything even when I'd genuinely offer. \n\nThis argument started when I invited him to my place for dinner (we usually hang out at his place because he's downtown). He saw that I live alone in a 2000sqft single family house. He asked how I could afford it and I said I bought it so that led to a conversation about what I actually do for work. \n\nTurns out, when I said I work in \"support\" he thought it was some minimum wage call center job and because I told him I usually work 20hr weeks, he assumed I must've been destitute or living paycheck to paycheck. I had no idea anyone would jump to this conclusion..\n\nIn reality, I do chat/email support for a software company and make 160k because it's a highly technical job. The 20hr work weeks is because I was previously a dev and overqualified for the job which means I get my work done pretty quickly. I aim to match the output of my teammates and have no desire to do more. \n\nAnyways, the relationship is over and he's asking for 1k to reimburse him for some of the dinners and trips we went on. If we ended amicably, sure, but he said some really stupid things about how I'm a liar etc. IMO, he's the asshole for assuming so much and he chose to pay for it despite me literally trying to hand him cash.

He shouldn't offer if he isn't able to pay.\n\nIf he thought that was your financial situation he could have inquired.  As long as you didn't outright lie about your finances or make it sound like you couldn't afford these things I don't see it as being an issue in a 5 month relationship. \n\nThat being said, if he was financing multiple expensive trips it would be decent to offer some reimbursement.

I would say you don't owe him for that", "Absolutely do NOT give him any money", "Absolutely without a second thought NTA. You offered to pay in the moment, he declined based on his own inaccurate assumption. You\u2019re in no way required to divulge your salary that early into a relationship (imo).

You are not forced to disclose salary and finances before you are ready. \n\nI don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t accept when you would want to pay - if someone offers it\u2019s usually because they can afford it. That\u2019s more on him for just assuming you were broke? Which is weird if you\u2019ve tried to pay multiple times.  \n\nSays more about him to just react that way and having this be the thing that ends the relationship. You don\u2019t owe him a thing.

Why didn\u2019t he want to know the first thing about your career? Why were you ok with him not knowing the first thing about your career? Why did you waste your time on someone who you didn\u2019t want to tell the first thing about yourself to? \n\nIf he\u2019s such a bad listener or so misogynistic he assumes women can\u2019t be high wage workers, he\u2019s no prize anyway.", "Idk... I'm leaning toward you not being TA, but I'm not totally supporting your refusal to reimburse money that you had previously offered, regardless.  And 5 months is long time to not talk about work... even if it's a cover story for your CIA position. \n\nJust to confirm... when he refused to accept money, did you think it was because he was being super generous or did he give ANY indication whatsoever that he didn't want you to be burdened financially (because he assumed you would be)? Why didn't you ever suggest a date and insist it's your treat?\n\nI would just Venmo the money or at least half and call it quits.", "NTA, but he is. You had no intent to deceive. You tried to hand him cash to boot. I myself also always tried to pay on dates, and would only concede when it was absolutely insisted as in your case. Even now, my long term bf and I split larger bills unless it\u2019s a special occasion or gift. As far as I\u2019m concerned, if you don\u2019t take my word for it when I say I want to pay, am willing to pay, am able to pay, that\u2019s your own problem - and dare I say, stupidity. Him drawing the wrong conclusion is his fault, and after 5 months you\u2019d think he would\u2019ve asked more about you, the person he is supposedly interested in. Even if he hadn\u2019t said hurtful things, asking for reimbursement is petty and gross. You can\u2019t ask for reimbursement for a gift legally, as far as I know. I can just picture Judge Judy laughing this guy out of court. NTA, NTA, NTA.", "NTA, Props on the sweet gig and tell him to enjoy dating his hand.", "NTA. He *assumed* that you weren't making much.

But you could\u2019ve been honest and told him he didn\u2019t have to pay for everything especially vacations because you can more then  afford those things.

On the other hand I can't imagine dating someone for five months and sharing so little about my life.", "> IMO, he's the asshole for assuming so much\n\nuh, no. no one i ever going to assume \"160k/year tech job\" from \"support\", and you do that intentionally. you are 100% TA on that. \n\n> AITA if I don't reimburse him?\n\nyou're NTA here only on a technicality. they were gifts and there are no takesies backsies on gifts. however, idk why you're suddenly not willing to pay for things you were willing to pay for before, seems like a lack of integrity to me.", "ESH. First, don't give a fucking dime to this dude because he's not entitled to shit. \n\nBut I'm genuinely confused why it took 5 months for you to explain what you do and the fact that you have a house. It's fine if you don't want to talk about every little detail, but my god you have to communicate better.", "YTA. \nBottom line is this, you knew that he believed your income was significantly less than his. Which is why he did not accept the money when you offered to pay. \n\nYou have been dating for 5 months and at NO instance could you find an occasion where you could pay. I find that hard to believe. Why not say when we go out tonight it will be my treat and I refuse to take no for an answer if you really wanted to pay. Stop saying that you genuinely offered. You did not. There are too many ways to get around this if you really wanted to.\n\nFor example, could have invited him to your home for dinner or whatever much earlier. \n\nBottom line is this you had a great guy who genuinely liked you and was willing to save you money when he felt that you had none. I doubt you understand how rare that is. You let him do it. \n\nTry to justify it all you want, but we know you could have stopped it and you didn\u2019t. That is why he is upset and feels used and betrayed. Of course he sees you as a liar. You went to his home and spent 5 months talking about all sorts of trauma and stuff and you couldn\u2019t say to him, I\u2019m not as broke as you believe. Didn\u2019t you give him a gift? Jeez.\n\nYTA big time.", "ESH:  Him for asking for money back that's tacky. \n\nNow I get not telling someone all trh details on the first date, even the 2nd or 3rd.  But to become official with someone, date them for 5 months, you should tell them not wait till they figure it out themselves.  \n\nI would end the relationship too because I would lose trust in you.", ">I had no idea anyone would jump to this conclusion..\n\nYou said you work in \"support\" 20hrs per week. You didn't think that present you as probably NOT making excess income? This sounds like you were being deliberately vague to see what he would do with it.\n\nYou went on whole trips and let him pay for everything without clarifying. YTA.", "\\*\\*\\*, because you didn't force him to pay for anything & even offered to pick up the tab. I'm not quite sure why the communication was so crappy. Seems like he'd ask a little more about what you do over 5 months, so there may be a certain amount of caginess to letting him assume you weren't making much money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- changing this to ESH, because in 5 months of dating you let the guy pay for everything & never bothered setting him straight on the fact that you could easily afford to pay sometimes.", "NTA. Wow what an entitled prick for blaming you for his assumption! You dodged a bullet and personally I wouldn\u2019t return his calls - even block him. \n\n\u2026I had a guy spurned who started stalking me and was harassing me. I had a police person over to discuss my concerns who instructed me to pick up his call when he dialed. He was demanding thousands. The backstory was before pot was legal in that state if had discovered he was a dealer and refused to continue to date him and backed out of a FREE trip (he smoked and he redeemed a brand name dollars - and yea this was early 2000s for us old folk haha) \n\nAnyway he was demanding the money on the phone where the officer could hear. She actually took the phone and identified herself and told him if he said one more word she would go issue a warrant for his arrest. He hung up and restraining order was easy after that. \n\nPoint is\u2026 she took my hands after as I was crying and told me whatever he spent of me was a gift. No court of law would back him. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\nIf you feel very strongly, donate $1k to a charity of your choice (feel free to be petty and donate to something you support and he hates) in his name. \n\nSure he\u2019ll get a little tax break but you walk away knowing you\u2019ve above and beyond done the right thing.", "NTA. You offered to pay for things and he made assumptions about you. You can\u2019t ask for money back for things like that when a relationship ends that\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou offered to pay and he declined. Its his fault he jumped to conclusions instead of, oh I don't know, asking follow up questions!\n\nYou dodged a bullet.", "YTA. You were dishonest. You lied by omission. He paid and refused to take your money on the assumption that you couldn't really afford it. He was kind enough to pay so you could date without worry. You were dishonest. I'd feel tricked if I were him. You should give him something, its the right thing to do.", "INFO: Did you pay your way fot all the dinners and trips? Or did you scam him?", "NTA. That's... not how breakups work... Sounds like you dodged a bullet. \n\nYou could donate $1K in his honor to a charity that supports low income women instead.", "NTA he thought he found a damsel in distress.  There was no contract or obligation in him giving you money.  It's standards he set up being a white chilvary white night and he got had because in his mind he rushed to his own judgement.  Do not pay him a penny.  No judge will sign off on that.", "NTA and this just clarified for me that I was right to let a guy know I didn\u2019t want a second date. He asked me one single question about me the whole date. It was about what I did. I gave a very abridged version - National Manager and left it at that as I correctly assumed he wasn\u2019t really interested. I had already paid for my own meal. He proceeded to talk about himself and how desireable he was because of x, y and z.  All of which to be desireable requires me to have little to no money and not own my own home. Not sure why so many people assume all women don\u2019t have good careers and can make good money. Don\u2019t reimburse him. You offered to pay at the time. NB I am not money focused. Don\u2019t need a partner to make good money, just need them to be genuinely interested.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a moral obligation to buy the most expensive handbag you can afford so everyone can know about your income, but resentment does pop up easily when you make a lot more than others.", "Nor is where you live I guess or the fact that you own your own home.", "The shit he said because you lied? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\nI'm a woman..... I'd never lie about anything if I was seriously interested in a guy.....\n\n\nYTA!\n\n\nFor clarity when I met my husband I earned more.... Now he does.... It HASN'T BEEN a problem!", "It's pretty normal to talk about your housing situation the first or second time you meet someone. You frame it as \"salary and assets\", that's not what it is about. It's chit chat about where you live, if its a house or an apartment, do you have a yard or a balcony, is your landlord a dick or do you own your house...\n\nI'm not saying you misled him, but it's pretty normal to tell someone that you own a house and invite them over - at least in the first month or so", "Not that in depth. But it's weird he was so unaware of what you do for work to the point he questioned your living situation. If you had just expanded a little bit, this whole situation could have been avoided.", "Exact numbers? No. But, you sound weirdly devoted to holding back the kind of critical information people would share if they ever hope to make it to a point of talking about moving in & making a life together.", "I find that really weird. 5 months is a lot of time. It\u2019s very surprising to me that you never had conversations about your job.\n\nThe big question is: did you intentionally not disclose how much you made? If that\u2019s the case I think you should reimburse him. If it just genuinely never came up, I don\u2019t think you owe him anything.", "Nothing in the comment you are replying to says to share your salary. That's your interpretation. \"Support\" seems intentionally vague, but then I don't know your reasons for not sharing. Even saying \"technical support,\" \"IT support,\" or \"computer support\" (if any are applicable) would make it easier for the next person to understand. They don't have to know what you make to know what field you work in, don't overthink it.\n\nI do find it interesting that you've repeatedly said \"well he didn't tell me so I didn't tell him\" and that he didn't know you had a house because you never mentioned it and just let him always decide where you were going. It sounds like you leave a lot up to your partner to decide how things will go, and regaining some agency in your next relationship may help clear the pathways of communication and lead you to a healthier place. At least the red flags on this one came up before too long!", "Maybe not salary, but it's weird to let someone pay for everything in a relationship when you're doing well financially. Even if he insisted it does seem like you took advantage of the situation.", ">Do you share your salary with new partners?\n\nNo, but I do share specifics like: job title, what I actually do, where I live, that I own my condo. In general I don't make a secret of anything or leave out details about my life.\n\nAs I said, this reads like you were deliberately deceptive with this guy. IMO you were lying by omission.", "I don't follow. When he assumed she was \"lesser\" because she was \"just support,\" he paid for her and hosted their overnight stays because he assumed she wouldn't be able to herself. The red flag is there, but it didn't show up when he thought she was lesser, it showed up after he realized she's not. Very different kind of red flag. More like the \"how they treat women who can take care of themselves and make them feel emasculated\" red flag.", "He had my address but yeah, he didn't know I owned the home", "Each to their own but I don't share my salary and assets with new partners until we're even thinking about potentially moving in together", "I've never disclosed my salary with a partner until we were having discussions about potentially moving in together which is usually at one year. I've never lied about my salary or even said \"I don't want to answer\". It just doesn't come up in my relationships till we're ready to move in together. I've never known about any of my exes salaries until that point either.", "That's the part I find strange. Either he spent the whole 5 months talking about himself, or she deliberately held back information.", "I don\u2019t think you need to provide all of those details that early but saying you work \u201csupport\u201d is being overly vague and maybe even a bit misleading. I\u2019m surprised you were dating for 5 months and the two of you never talked more about your career paths", "Never said share what you earn.... But whilst dating you could have paid for dinner....\n\n\nMy husband would try and pay for everything but I wouldn't let him. He went to the loo?? You know I'm paying for everything we've ordered so far!", " You are not obligated to share your salary. I find it odd that some folks seem to think you are.", "But you still willingly let them pay for everything. I could never in good conscious put that entire burden on my partner.", "With the way that she acts in this thread, I think it\u2019s a bit safer to assume that information was purposely withheld", "Yeah, I don't think she owes him the $1K, because that is just a strange ask on his part and was hopefully a lapse in judgment while angry. But to not talk about her work at all EXCEPT details that make her sound in need of cash? That's incredibly suspect. She at least owed this guy honesty and a sincere attempt at the relationship during that 5 months of dating.", "Then I'd ask why Im expected to when he didn't? All he said was that he was a project manager. See my post edit about why we didn't talk about careers.", "Did you read the post? She offered to pay several times and he declined! That's on him. Doesn't matter how much money she makes.", "Yeah, I wound up changing my post to ESH because there really was an information imbalance that she should have set straight much earlier in the relationship. She knew where he lived & had a more accurate idea of his job, while she kept her stuff in a black box.", "I read it...  I'm married to a man who was similar and I still managed to pay for dates.....", "Nah, he knew where I lived. He had my address but never wanted to come over because he has a swanky apartment downtown where are the bars are. I had a more accurate idea of his job? How do you figure that? I don't really know what his job is either lol", "NTA, and i\u2019m begging you not to reimburse this guy.", "NTA. You don't owe him anything", "NTA His ego was bruised because he found out you make more money than him.", "NTA he is TA even if you made 1000 times what he does if he insists on paying it's on him. If he couldn't afford it, he should have let it be known, picked cheaper places, or cooked for you himself. I don't know how he could ask for reimbursement with a straight face and any amount of pride. Chivalry is definitely dead.", "NTA, there are 3 things I don't talk about, salary/job is one of them, like you my job doesn't define me.  Am more than my job or the money I make.   IMHO, he felt superior in the relationship because he picked up the tabs, it fed his ego, now that he found out you own your own home & it's not a dog sit down, he can't feel superior anymore.  You don't owe him any money, he's an AH, be glad it's over.", "ESH - he sucks for demanding reimbursement. You suck for being so vague about your life after dating for 5 months and allowing this dude to pay for all dates and trips. You could have set him straight on his assumptions. When I hear someone works in \u201csupport\u201d for 20hrs a week that doesn\u2019t exactly scream six figure job.", "He\u2019s weird for that, anyway, glad to se you winning.  Xo", " NTA at all", "You guys broke up because you make more money than he thought you did? That has to be the dumbest reason to breakup I\u2019ve ever heard lol. Your NTA, but silly that you guys would even fight about something so stupid. And no, don\u2019t give him any money. That\u2019s even more dumb lol", "He dumped you because you make too much money? What a dummy. NTA", "NTA. The man needs to learn not to jump to conclusions. Or make the wrong assumptions. But good for you and your success! Rock on. His loss and you can do better.", "NTA.  You work \"support\" for 20 hours a week and that didn't lead to more questions from him for 5 months?  If you offered to pay at the time and he didn't accept then it's on him. If it was me I would've just made a joke like damn you're paying for the next date and kept on going. His loss.", "YTA if you don\u2019t pay him back something. It\u2019s an innocent misunderstanding that led to him finding the situation to be unfair. It was unfair. Besides, you never know what the future holds and you two may still enjoy a friendship on a level playing field. He wanted you to pull your weight when he found out you could. I think you\u2019ll be happier with yourself if you square up with him.", "So why didn't op bring it up.", "Yeah I said this earlier in the thread, I can't imagine the answers if it was a dude who makes 5x his girlfriends income and had her pay for literal trips", "I disagree. Support can mean front line, as in call center, or it can mean managing the call center, or managing the managers of the call center. Or it can mean managing support accounts of, or being the support for, corporate customers. Those jobs pay quite handsomely for larger accounts.\n\nI think the ex enjoyed seeing OP as less-than, and got off on feeling like the generous benefactor, and then got pissed off when he was no longer able to feel superior.", "Spoken like a true Incel...", "Can I ask you this then? \n\nI told him how I went on vacation abroad for 2 weeks right before we met. I told him about my hobbies with 3d printing and woodworking which he shares and knows how expensive it can get. \n\nAt what point are you just a dumb mofo if you can't figure out on your own that I'm not broke?", "So, by your logic, he dated her because he felt sorry for her? That by dating her he was making her life better, raising her status? That he was such a catch, saving her from a life of destitution and poverty? Well, if he was such a noble individual, why is it his masculinity was so threatened when he found out she made more money than him? You're right, my Incel little friend, she should give him something: the middle finger.", "I lied by omission? Even when I told him about my expensive hobbies like woodworking and 3d printing? How about when I told him I spent weeks out of the country for vacation in 2022?", "He still made assumptions and never bothered to find out any details.\n\nHe still never even visited your place until 5 months in.\n\nHe insisted on paying even when you genuinely offered to pay for or split some things.\n\nHis loss. NTA.\n\n(Edit: also, for the record, if I found out the woman I had been dating secretly made lots more money than I thought and had a much nicer place than I expected... I would be thrilled? That's a huge win! And somehow this guy instead got so mad about it, that you two broke up? What an AH)", "I brought up the vacations I took recently and the expensive hobbies I have. The more I think about it, the more I feel that he was stupid to not have picked up on it earlier.", "Lmao he sounds like the sort of guy who wouldn't even date people who earn more than him as it would be emasculating for him. What a sad sop. I doubt he would bring up how much he earned to his dates as he doesn't want to be dated for his money, so why should she?", "Why didn't you push the cash in the direction of the cash register instead? \n\nJust once in 5 months.", "So I told him I went on a vacation abroad for my birthday last year. I also told him about the expensive hobbies I have, some of which we share. Please tell me why he would still assume I'm broke?", "I've told him about my expensive hobbies (that we share) and the trips to other countries I've been on, including in 2022. I don't know why he'd assume I couldn't afford our dates.", "Exactly. This group is HORRIBLE about double standards lol.", "And PMs can work in all sorts of industries for a wide range of salaries.... Dude doesn't seem like the swiftest character if he couldn't put 2 and 2 together, I mean hobbies including travel and 3d printing, come on..... Maybe you dodged a bullet.", "Why are you so bitter and angry that you call everyone incels? Wonder if this is OP or one of her friends", "This sub will bend over backwards to defend OP if she's a woman, this thread would already be tagged YTA if OP was a guy and made his girlfriend pay for meals and trips while making 5x her income and knowingly misleading others on your income", "Not at all. He dated her because he liked her and as she states he misunderstood her job title. She didn't bother putting him right. Why on earth not? Why if your seeing someone you like would you not be honest? If not at the beginning as time goes on. She could have simply said, I can afford it. She knew he was paying because he thought she couldn't. That's what makes it dishonest.\n\nBTW 'incel?' I'm a 51 year old mum.", "This probably ruin his sense of provider and being the one with the power in the relationship.  Sucks for him if that's how sees relationships.", "I told him I went on vacation abroad right before we met. I told him I plan on visiting Europe in 2023. I told him about my hobbies with 3d printing and woodworking which he shares so he knows how expensive it can get. Sorry but no, I did not give off clues that suggested I was poor.", "It's because they believe women are helpless creatures that need to be infantilized and aren't capable of the accountability to not let someone you know isn't as financially comfortable pay for everything \ud83e\udd7a", "Exactly.", "New-Introduction-182  \nShe called me an incel and I'm a 51yr old mum.", "The guys is an ahole for asking for reimbursement after breaking up. Based on OPs edit he failed to ask follow up questions. I don't think OP lied, but I do think it was slightly misleading, maybe even a bit intentionally so. \n\nI do think saying I work support, and work 20 hrs makes it seem like a part-time call center support job, versus \"i work in software development supports and manage to get all my work done in 20 hrs but get paid for 40hrs.\" Gives very different impressions. \n\nIdk if it is feeling emasculated, because I could see a similar situation play out between newish friends, and someone being upset. \n\nI get OP offered to pay, but that is still different than letting someone know, i can afford to pay this no problem but if you want to pay I won't stop you.", "I think you are being a bit obtuse in terms of having black and white thinking.\n\nNo one thinks that you need to present a financial statement with your salary and assets including the cost of your home.\n\nHowever it does appear that you are obfuscating your employment deliberately. Honestly if someone says they work in \"support\" I am going to assume they are the low level person who picks up the phone and solves minor issues like how to return an item. \n\nAnd most people would have some idea of how a friend lives - in a single family home without roommates in a specific area. And then a natural thing would be whether they own or rent without getting into specifics of how much rent or how much a house cost. It just seems like the most minimal information that even friends (platonic) exchange with each other as they get to know each other. \n\nYour job is much more than that and most people do discuss their jobs on some level with someone after five months of dating. \n\nYou keep saying that you had much interesting \"hobbies\" and interests to discuss - again no one is saying that you needed to provide blow by blow descriptions but most people after five months have some sort of idea of what their boyfriend/girlfriend does.\n\nAlso - and I am not questioning your integrity - but how strongly did you insist on paying for yourself. I am a woman and I do not accept polite offers of offering to cover my tab as I insist - not to the point of being obnoxious of course but to the point where the other person knows that I actually want to pay.\n\nNo you don't owe him $1000 repayment but in the future I would think it would be a good idea to share more of yourself because even without the issue of feeling \"used\" in terms of his having paid for you, most people would feel you were off if you had concealed such basic information", "Its just some misandrist probably on their 182nd account, by looking at the name. I always find it funny when misandrists talk down to incels, they don't realize they are looking in the mirror at themselves", "I didn't mislead. He knows I like expensive hobbies. I assumed he had figured out that I could afford expensive things.", "That's fair, I guess I'll talk about my boring ass job more. \n\nAnyways, I thought about it some more and I don't think I was wrong for how it all went down. I told him about my expensive hobbies (that we share so he 100% knows how expensive it gets) and the vacations I took even recently as of last year right before we met. He's dumb AF if still thought I was broke after all that.", "You knew enough to see that he lived in a swanky apartment downtown and could afford to treat you to everything including trips (plural), whereas he didn't even know you had a house, much less that you only work part-time hours because you've already made bank. \n\nIf I heard that someone your age was working 20 hours a week in support, I would assume they didn't have much money, too. You were deliberately vague about your job, and you didn't care what his job was, because it was all about having fun and using him, rather than actually caring about each other. \n\nIt's garbage that you are trying to pass it off as \"I'm more than my job\" and \"I would have NO IDEA someone would think this about me\" \\*flutter eyelashes innocently\" Puh-lease. \n\nWhile I wouldn't have gone as far as to ask for reimbursement for dates, I can see why he's pissed. You're incredibly manipulative, and don't seem the least bothered by it. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a troll post just so you could get some kicks out of \"look what I did\". \n\nI'd give you the Y T A, but he did do the \"pay me back\" thing, so you get ESH.", "Okay so where did he think I got the money from when I told him about how I spent weeks abroad for my birthday, or go on climbing trips, or all the hobby shit I have (3d printers, woodworking, painting)? It's not like I pretended to live a frugal life lol"]}
