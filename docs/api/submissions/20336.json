However, that woman was extremely overweight. I don't usually care about people's weights, that's their life, but she was obviously going to end up hurting my horse. So I simply said that no, she isn't allowed to because I'll be the only one riding it that day. She got angry because she would have to wait around an hour (all lesson horses were being used) plus the owner also insisted and asked why not, if I've always said yes.\n\nI answered \"I already gave my answer and I'm looking out for my horse's health because with all due respect, I won't let her get hurt carrying too much weight\" and left. But later they saw me letting my friend P on my horse and confronted me about it. The woman started yelling about how I committed a hate crime against her and how I discriminated her because of her weight, that I was a fat phobic person, etc. The owner came and apologized to her while glaring at ME.\n\nAfter the woman left claiming that this was the worst stable and blablabla, the owner said I shouldn't have been an AH because of her weight and just to let her get on. Now, it's true that my decision was based on her weight which could seem fat phobic, but I truly wouldn't care about her weight if it weren't for the fact that she wanted my horse to carry her and use her for a lesson. \n\nMost riders there agree with me, but the clients who saw the situation, some parents and the owners are calling me a fat phobic AH. So, I need an unbiased opinion, AITA?\n\nETA: Owner is a long time family friend, I pay for all things included in the stable but she gives a bit of a discount because I let her use my horse sometimes and she's a family friend.

That's the point. Your horse cares about the amount of weight on his back. He doesn't care about whether the person is very tall, or \"big boned\", or about whether it's all muscle or all fat. He doesn't care about the person's race, or age, or sex. He cares about how much they weigh.

Doesn\u2019t even matter if the person wasn\u2019t overweight you choose who gets on.\n\nAnd horses do have a weight capacity. If the owner lets people get on horses without accounting for that I\u2019m a little concerned for the horses they own. They overstepped big time.\n\nNTA this is weird", "You know, MRI machines have weight limits, so do gurneys and elevators. I think the stable owner is TA - she ought to care enough about the animals' well being to know that horses too have weight limits. \n\nI understand that the overweight person was mortified but not overloading your horse is real. Vet bills are real and if she really hurt your horse it may never be the same horse again. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - And why was the owner trying to force you? Don\u2019t you pay to have your horse there?", "NTA. If she obly has 5 horses, she should only have 5 students. Her failure to plan for enough is not your problem.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a horse person and have no desire to ride one, but have seen the effects of heavy people on a horse. It causes permanent damage to the horse\u2019s spinal cord. You did the right thing and frankly, it should be considered illegal animal abuse for anyone over a certain weight to ride a horse.", "NTA - as a woman of size I hope I\u2019d have the compassion to spare the poor horse. And if I had to have it spelled out for me (I hope I\u2019m never so obtuse), I hope I\u2019d be able to honor the physics and say \u201cfair enough.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s lots of ways to get victimized as a fat person. She doesn\u2019t need to drum shit up.\n\nEdit: forgot the \u201cif\u201d", "NTA - as a certified instructor, who's been managing a riding school for 3+ years, my weight limits were:\n\n90 kg. for larger horses\n\n80 kg. for small horses\n\n70 kg. for large ponies\n\n60 kg. for smaller ponies.\n\nI had 3 ponies where the weight limit was 50 kg. Had a few draft horse-types for adult male students, but wight limit for them was still 115 kg.. All based on science:\n\n15-20% of the horses bodyweight, depending on your skill level, because anything above heavily impact the horses balance, muscle-movement,  spine, etc. etc., not to mention an unbalanced rider, as beginner often are, will put pressure on the bridle, when they inevitably use the reins as balance-assistance. A teenage boy, weighing 60-70 kg., can put a pressure of up to 350 kg. on the reins! Imagine if the weight of the rider was double that!?\n\nIf the owner gives you grief, just tell him you're trying to avoid kissing spine and a need of chiropractor for the entire overline, unless of course he's willing to pay for 4+ sessions with a licensed chiropractor and whatever additional treatment the chiropractor finds necessary. Most licensed chiropractors, at least where I'm from, are also equine vets., so it could easily be an expensive affair.\n\nIt's not fat phobia, it's animal welfare.

I have no idea why this is even a thing.\n\n\nI would look into another stable.\n\nCan someone explain if this is normal? \n\n\nAlso, there are weight limits for horseback riding because of the danger to the horse.

Since I am almost 300 pounds for a horse to safely carry me it would need to be about 1500 pounds. Horses can range in weight from 900 to 2000 pounds, I just have to accept that more half of horses cannot safely carry me, limiting what I can do. Nothing discriminatory about it, its about the animals safety", "NTA, every thing has weight limits including horses.", "NTA. And I say that as an overweight person. I have a couple of \"pasture ponies\" I would never let anyone but a kid get on, I'd never even DREAM of getting on one of them myself, because it isn't about what's politically correct, it's about simple physics. You can't argue against science (well, I guess if you are an idiot you could). A horse is simply not able to bear over a certain weight. I wouldn't be able to trust that stable owner again, they were perfectly fine with putting your horse at risk to appease a customer.", "NTA. Wow. I used to board my horses. This situation is weird. The barn owner is overstepping so many boundaries. It\u2019s your horse, not hers. I can\u2019t wrap my head around this situation.

You can find cheap adult-size chairs with a weight limit of 250 lb.  No one is going to call the furniture company fat-phobic for selling a chair that won't hold a 300 lb. person, any more than people selling shirts in size S. \n\nThat said, you don't mention (and probably don't know) the person's weight.  Make sure if you're not allowing 300 lb. on the back of your horse, you don't ride double either.", "NTA- it's not fat phobic to refuse her a ride, it's a reality based decision. Your horse is a living breathing, feeling animal with limitations on the amount of weight they can safely and comfortably carry. To ignore that reality would be animal abuse. I hope the owner was just putting on a show to appease that entitled jerk, otherwise I'd look into changing stables.", "NTA, also it may be time for you to look for another place to board if you can. I was in the same situation in the late 90s. Not only was the other person WAY too large to me on my 22 year old warm blood, he'd have hurt this lady too.", "I am fat. NTA. I am painfully aware that my weight squashes chair cushions, makes valleys in mattresses, and intrudes on others' airplane seats.

And horses are living beings - not machines or carnival rides.", "NTA this was about your horses house. I don\u2019t see any other solution to the problem and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re fat phobic.", "NTA\n\nI would have laughed in her face at \"hate crime\". Her crawling her ass on a horse would be animal abuse.", "NTA. everything has a weight limit, including animals that people can ride. if this lady's weight exceeded your horse's limit, she can ride another one safely. it was wrong of the stable owner to press you for a reason, after you said no.", "NTA - And you already know that answer. Some people feel like they are entitled to anything. If the owner talks to you again about this in the future - tell her the truth is that this person weighed too much, and they know it. Expecting you to hurt your horse and to deal with the consequences after the fact.... In order to not hurt someone's feelings is ridiculous. Stand your ground.", "NTA - I am a fatty, and I know that there are limitations to what I can do because of it. I would never sit there and let my desire to ride a horse supersede the health of the horse.

I\u2019ve always been perturbed to see a very large person on a horse. You did not commit a hate crime - you were doing exactly what you should be doing and looking out for your horse. She needs a reality check - her size is her size.", "NTA.  I am a fat person.  I am a very fat person.  I won't disclose how much I weigh, but it is A LOT.  I'm currently working to lose weight, and am experiencing success, but even if I wasn't, that doesn't change my value as a human being. \n\nWhat that does impact though is the reality of my physical presence in the world.  I worry about weight limits on chairs and other furniture.  I worry about fitting into theater seats comfortably.   I recently went on vacation and paid for 2 plane tickets, without shame, because while I can technically still fit into one seat, it's massively uncomfortable and leaves me pressed up against a stranger for hours at a time, which also makes them uncomfortable.\n\nA horse is a living thing.  It doesn't care about skinny, fat, or otherwise.  It does care a lot of how much weight it has to carry.  Even a skinny person with an additional hundred pounds of gear or equipment would be an unfair burden on the horse.  This is physics, not discrimination.  I'm sorry this lady was embarrassed, but sometimes that happens in life.", "NTA, I was a 4Her growing up. My dad was a big guy, 6\u20195\u201d 275#. His horse was 17 hands and really stocky.
