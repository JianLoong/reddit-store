She dates unemployed losers, f\\*ck boy types who don't want anything serious, or men who are already in relationships. She becomes over attached to her partners and then gets heartbroken when these relationships don't end well for her, going so far as to play the victim when another woman called her out publicly for sleeping with her fianc\u00e9. Our family always pick up the pieces when her relationships end and she goes into massive depressive episodes. I love her, but it can be exhausting, and she never learns from her past mistakes.\r  \n\r  \nHer current partner (M26) falls into the unemployed loser category. He's barely worked in his life and spends most of his time playing video games.\r  \n\r  \nDespite this, Millie fell pregnant five months into the relationship. They moved in together shortly before the baby was born (he resisted moving out of his parents til the final hour) and they now share a nine month old son. They both love the baby, but the relationship is strained. Millie is on mat leave while he is still unemployed, and  furthermore, he doesn't help around the house with the baby or the chores, leading to Millie being stressed and overwhelmed. I try to help out when I can, but I am running my own business and also live an hour away, so the help I can offer is limited.\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, I got engaged to my long-time partner on Christmas Eve and announced the news the following day at Christmas dinner as the entire family was attending. Naturally, my family were ecstatic, but while Millie congratulated me, she looked sad/annoyed for the rest of the evening, and it became obvious her mood had soured.\r  \n\r  \nThis resulted in the family coddling her all night and asking if she was ok, to which she kept on saying, \"I'm fine,\" while clearly being in a mood, refusing to engage in conversations, snapping at people, etc. At one point, she came back from the bathroom and looked as if she had been crying, so I pulled her aside to asked what was going on. \r  \n\r  \nShe said the announcement of my engagement on Christmas was stealing her thunder, as it was her baby's first Christmas and her son should be the main focus.  She then accused me of \"rubbing my relationship and happiness in her face\" because I knew things were not good with her relationship. \r  \n\r  \nThis is the part where I might be an ass. I got annoyed, called her entitled, and asked why she couldn't just be happy for me. She then accused me of not being supportive of her, and I snapped and said it's not my fault you let some loser knock you up; we all tried to warn you. I was also quick to snap because I feel like every family event since she got pregnant has centered around the same drama with her baby daddy.\r  \n\r  \nShe ended up storming off and leaving with her baby and partner, and now my parents say I need to be the one to clear the air as the eldest sibling.

He has different faces and names, but it's the same guy.  Mr. Unavailable/unreliable.\n\nShe needs to do a lot of work on herself, with a good therapist.  Because the problem is her and the choices she makes.\n\nNTA and congratulations on your engagement.  Do not, unless you are a glutton for punishment, have her in your wedding party. ((hugs))\n\nAnd my unsolicited wedding planning advice - if you are doing paper RSVP cards number them an keep a list.  People have terrible handwriting and leave stuff blank.", "Oh so she\u2019s a home wrecking whoreo and doesn\u2019t give a fuck about anyone but herself. Constant victim mentality?", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Because people always blame the person who defends themselves.  They never put blame on the person who started it.  The bully gets away with things but when the person being bullied speaks up or acts out, now they're the one in the wrong.  It's messed up really that people expect you to just be a doormat your whole life to a crappy person.", "Don't listen to that poster. They didn't even read your post. Your sister absolutely was nasty and confrontational.\n\nShe is issues that your parents need to deal with. If your family can't handle you having happy news, then they don't get to share in your happiness. \n\nAnd I cannot say enough about how awful your mom is for that older sibling BS. Tell her to shove it, or tell her to clear the air and fix her daughter because she's the mother.", "That's fair, I suppose.  The comment seems to fit into a pattern on this sub (and in general) where when a man doesn't have it together, he is just needs to grow up, figure it out, and get it together, but when a woman is similarly situated, commenters wonder what happened to cause her to be that way, who failed her, how we might bend over backwards to accommodate her, no matter what damage she might be causing, and what help she might need.", "Not a friends partner, but the partner of someone who was friends with her best friend. So a mutual acquaintance I guess? Regardless it caused issues in her friend group which resulted in her having to briefly move back in with our parents. \n\nShe has a history of both sleeping with men in relationships and faking pregnancy scares when they break things off.", "Are you the sister? Why do you think OP and her family are responsible for the sister's actions and poor decisions? They cannot force the sister to do the right thing. They can only do what they have done - advice and hope she learns.", "It\u2019s absolutely a thing when someone needs a wake up call about their life and behavior.", "When you distill it down to that, you're correct.\n\nBut ... We're talking about a family. And we're talking about a daughter whose choices affect that family.

So by your very usage \"That's not a thing\" is not a thing.\n\nBut yes, as an adult, sometimes you get criticism or unsolicited advice...and you should expect it especially if you're acting like a fool.  \n\nI want to know what world or state of being you're living in where you don't get advice, unsolicited advice, criticism or whatever. Is this Disneyland you're living in? Or do you just put your headphones on, crank up Swift, and float through life?", "Exactly, it was such a bad choice that it's still affecting the whole family a year and a half later.\n\nTime doesn't erase bad decisions, especially when she hasn't learned from them and is still acting entitled and spoiled.\n\nShe deserved that wake up call. Someone had to finally tell her how it is.", "How is OPs sister the one being bullied? She's constantly making poor dating decisions and is probably continuing to be coddled by her parents, I'm also pretty certain that OP was in no way shape or form trying to \"steal her sister's Thunder\" if OPs sister is really that upset she should sit down and do some self reflection (in fact she should do some self reflection on why she continues to pick poor partners).", "I disagree with said pattern, to be honest.

When did this behavior start, and what have your parents done to try and address her mental health issues? Do they just react to whatever her latest crisis is, or have they taken any proactive steps to get her the kind of help she actually needs?", "I was wondering the same thing. Trying to blame anyone but sister for her actions???", "This happens a lot in this sub - the OP will include so much \u201ccontext\u201d about how awful someone is over a long period of time THEN the actual conflict happens which will be its own unique conflict that is not about the past. It\u2019s all just an attempt to justify OP saying mean things to their sister. \n\nIn this instance OPs sister was being immature and sulking about this engagement. That was incredibly immature. OP could have told her that. Instead she went off about her getting pregnant and insulted the father, none of which was relevant. \n\nIf OP had genuine concern about the direction of her sister\u2019s life, this was not how to address it.", "People who walk around unsolicitedly criticizing others are called AHs.

She sleeps with a man in a relationship, we let her vent about how the guy or the guy's partner is the bad one; she gets into a toxic relationship; we let her vent about how the guy treats her; she burn bridges with her friends; we let her vent about how the friends wronged her. She fails exams in uni; we let her vent about how the teachers are unfair... the list goes on and on", "You must be a bot because I don't even think your paragraphs make sense together. Also, I'm not sure that you're a member of a family which is tragic, because you don't seem to understand a goddamn thing about how families interact.

Your parents should though.", "She definitely needs a qualified therapist who deals with relationship and family trauma. \n\nMany girls/women have issues with male validation and wanting to feel different/superior from other girls but it\u2019s all just internalized sexism. A lot of girls grow out of that phase, but a lot don\u2019t ( r/notliketheothergirls has a lot of good posts where women talk about how they grew out of it). \n\nIt took me going to therapy in college to realize that no amount of male validation was going to fill the hole inside myself because I didn\u2019t have enough self-love/self-validation. Once I started practicing loving and respecting myself, I started finding real healthy relationships (both platonic and romantic) based on mutual respect and love.\n\nGood luck with your sis OP, I can tell you\u2019re a loving and sweet sibling.
