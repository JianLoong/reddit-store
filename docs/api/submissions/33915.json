She dates unemployed losers, f\\*ck boy types who don't want anything serious, or men who are already in relationships. She becomes over attached to her partners and then gets heartbroken when these relationships don't end well for her, going so far as to play the victim when another woman called her out publicly for sleeping with her fianc\u00e9. Our family always pick up the pieces when her relationships end and she goes into massive depressive episodes. I love her, but it can be exhausting, and she never learns from her past mistakes.\r  \n\r  \nHer current partner (M26) falls into the unemployed loser category. He's barely worked in his life and spends most of his time playing video games.\r  \n\r  \nDespite this, Millie fell pregnant five months into the relationship. They moved in together shortly before the baby was born (he resisted moving out of his parents til the final hour) and they now share a nine month old son. They both love the baby, but the relationship is strained. Millie is on mat leave while he is still unemployed, and  furthermore, he doesn't help around the house with the baby or the chores, leading to Millie being stressed and overwhelmed. I try to help out when I can, but I am running my own business and also live an hour away, so the help I can offer is limited.\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, I got engaged to my long-time partner on Christmas Eve and announced the news the following day at Christmas dinner as the entire family was attending. Naturally, my family were ecstatic, but while Millie congratulated me, she looked sad/annoyed for the rest of the evening, and it became obvious her mood had soured.\r  \n\r  \nThis resulted in the family coddling her all night and asking if she was ok, to which she kept on saying, \"I'm fine,\" while clearly being in a mood, refusing to engage in conversations, snapping at people, etc. At one point, she came back from the bathroom and looked as if she had been crying, so I pulled her aside to asked what was going on. \r  \n\r  \nShe said the announcement of my engagement on Christmas was stealing her thunder, as it was her baby's first Christmas and her son should be the main focus.  She then accused me of \"rubbing my relationship and happiness in her face\" because I knew things were not good with her relationship. \r  \n\r  \nThis is the part where I might be an ass. I got annoyed, called her entitled, and asked why she couldn't just be happy for me. She then accused me of not being supportive of her, and I snapped and said it's not my fault you let some loser knock you up; we all tried to warn you. I was also quick to snap because I feel like every family event since she got pregnant has centered around the same drama with her baby daddy.\r  \n\r  \nShe ended up storming off and leaving with her baby and partner, and now my parents say I need to be the one to clear the air as the eldest sibling.

She can't be happy for someone else and that's sad. She needs to grow up. \n\nYou did what no one else did. Laid it out in black and white. Not everyone is going to fawn over her and her baby.", "Congratulations on your engagement.  \n\nYour parents are wrong.  It would have better if, rather than attacking her poor choices, you had gone through the list of how you had supported her and suggest that when she loses this man, and she will, she picks up a therapist instead.  NTA.", "NTA.\nWhile it sucks your sister is unhappy, she made every choice that led her there and she is responsible for that. \nI'm quite sure that baby was focused on. My sister just had a baby and when I announced my engagement at Christmas everyone was happy, discussed weddings, discussed babies, discussed everything while passing around and individually doting on the baby. So her reasoning is BS \nAnd my parents used to hold me to a higher standard as the eldest like that.  Until they realized my sister was abusing me. They've apologized profusely to me. \nTell your parents they are not doing her any favors coddling her. And that you did nothing wrong other than say what needed to be said a long time ago. Was it harsh? Yes. If you want you could apologize for being harsh but you will stand by what you said although you wished you'd said it nicer. But only if you want. Your parents need to tell her \"suck it up buttercup \" I hope you have them read this. \nNtA", "NTA.  Congratulations on your engagement.  Keep low communication with her.  You have a business and wedding planning to deal with.", "> I need to be the one to clear the air as the eldest sibling.\n\nI don't see the logic here. Traditionally, shouldn't the elders be respected in a family? Like, if a younger family member argues with an older member, usually the younger member is expected to apologize, not the other way around.", "NTA, sounds like she\u2019s used to being the one getting all the attention and can\u2019t handle that now the spotlight is on somebody else. Also it sounds like she\u2019s jealous and insecure; your mere announcing of the biggest news of your life is hardly rubbing it in her face. It\u2019s ridiculous that she thinks the focus should be on the baby just because it\u2019s his first Christmas. It isn\u2019t his first birthday party. You are not wrong here. You\u2019re allowed to celebrate your own life. You aren\u2019t taking anything away from her, and from the sounds of it it\u2019s actually quite the opposite.", "Very obviously NTA\n\nYour sister is in for a terrible time with a child.\n\nIf your happiness is stealing HER thunder because it takes away attention from HER child, she's not going to like it when that human being that she brought into the world is stealing HER thunder by achieving things through out his life.", "NTA. I don't think it's your responsibility to clear the air because you're the eldest, but maybe because you are the most stable. Maybe apologize for the harsh delivery. Explain that joy is limitless. It's not exclusive to just 1 occasion. The fact that she wasn't able to be happy for you despite your constant support and listening ear was extremely frustrating. Then ask her if she be willing to do - what you want her to do going forward. Whether that's be happy for you, keep it to herself, ask you about your life etc....", "How dare you get engaged when it's the baby's first Christmas\n\nAva next year, it will be the first time the baby says mama.  So no getting engaged then either.\n\nAnd the following year, the baby nay crawl.. so you better understand who comes first, missy!\n\n/s\n\nLive your life.  Congrats.\n\nNTA", "NTA only immature people can't handle their sibling announcing their engagement", "You\u2019d be surprised how many people do that. My sister high jacked my birthday to celebrate her baby\u2019s 4 months, yes she celebrates every month. I literally got home to find out that the cake and presents I thought were for me were for the baby. I was told to get ready bc they had a surprise for me. Nope she just wanted to use the house on my birthday to host a party for her kid bc \u201cyour place is bigger\u201d", "Sister wanted Christmas to be all about her son. Is that ok?\n\nOP is NTA.", "Being a good mother and good sister are to different things. And being a good mother doesn't change that she's the AH in this instance.", "Exactly this!!", "The \u201ccremated\u201d bit? Did not notice until you pointed it out. Thanks, I got a bit of a chuckle with that one.", "> She sleeps with a man in a relationship, we let her vent about how the guy or the guy's partner is the bad one; she gets into a toxic relationship; we let her vent about how the guy treats her; she burn bridges with her friends; we let her vent about how the friends wronged her. She fails exams in uni; we let her vent about how the teachers are unfair\n\nSounds like you have all enabled her. Why then are you acting surprised that she has turned into this 'monster'?"]}
