That's unforgivable.  \"Ruining her special year\"?  \"He didn't give them a chance to name their son after him\"?? What the heck!!\n\nOP, I hope you don't give them one more second of thought.  May you find peace and comfort in knowing that the love and memories you've shared with your husband will forever be cherished.  All my love to you and Ian.", "I am so sorry. May your days of life be filled with peace, love, and care from here on out and may you be received into arms of love in the afterlife.", "This..so much this! \ud83e\ude75", "I came here to say this", "Yes. Seconding this. \n\nAnd the way they reacted, it would have probably been drama and accusations of AHery no matter how you had chosen to handle it, OP. Don't worry about them in what time you have left.", "My heart goes out to you. I'm glad you have a loving and supportive partner to help you through this difficult time. If ever oh ever there is a time to make it \"about you\" - now is that time . You take whatever space you need for you.\n\nNTA", "The quote from family that he was dying because he was sinful was enough for me to stop reading. \n\nIf that were true, a lot of evil people would no longer be with us rather than losing OP. \n\nI wish you all the best, OP. You're one of the good ones and if you believe in the afterlife, they're getting a good one far too soon.", "That is beautifully written.", "Amen!!", "I thought the same thing, like W T F", "My ex husband has a close friend who does a \"birthday month\" she drove me nuts.", "Hell I\u2019d go to a lawyer and get paperwork done on TOP of the marriage certificate. I don\u2019t trust that family as far I can throw them.", "NTA times infinity.  \nYour family doesn't deserve you. People who use religion to excuse their bigotry are hypocrites. They are choosing to be awful to you knowing full well that their time is vastly limited. Your shared DNA shouldn't entitle them to any more opportunity to abuse you.\nIan is the one standing up for you and should be the one you lean into from now on. May you make many beautiful memories together. \nAll the best to you. Will keep you both in my prayers \ud83d\udc9c", "I hope you and Ian have more time than expected to be together and make memories.i hope you know that you did nothing wrong.  You tried to not spoil special days for your sisters by keeping it private for a bit. The fact she said you're spoiling her special year says so much about her. Something she and the rest have to live with when they realise what they have done.  Please please try to forget them if that makes your life more peaceful as really all that counts is you right now. The family have each other to support them while they should be supporting you. Something they clearly don't know how to.", "You\u2019re such a kind and caring partner and I\u2019m glad you two have each other.  Your family doesn\u2019t deserve you. My heart goes out to you and Ian.", "Your \u201cfamily\u201d isn\u2019t worth the time you have left. You tried to give them a gift of some good celebrations, and I hope they will eventually grow up and look fondly on those moments. \n\nBut that\u2019s not your concern. Make memories with Ian, love him, and help each other get ready for what comes next.", "Also, talk to your bank about getting his name on EVERYTHING - your bank accounts, your pink slips for vehicles, your deed/mortgage or rental agreements - as a joint owner so that your parents can't dispute it when you die. If you have a will, no matter how airtight, they can dispute but if the transfer happens while you're living and still considered of sound mind its indisputable (at least in my area. Usually shitty people use it to screw over their kids one last time, but it does have good uses too)", "My thoughts too- a gentle loving prayer. And they even offered it \u201cif OP wants it\u201d\n\nNo pressure, just love.", "This right here. I can not recommend this enough. Make sure EVERYTHING is outlined on who it goes to and what you want done with your remains. I\u2019ve seen too much of this going happening after someone passes. That being said, I hope your remaining time is spent happily", "i highly doubt they will regret anything considering all they seem to care is their son dying a \"sinner\" rather than you know...he is dying.", "Wishing you and Ian peace, comfort and support.\n\nIf there is a service once you're gone, OP, maybe have an off duty police person stay in your house. The worst families will break in during a service and take stuff they think they deserve. They've proven that they couldn't handle the information that you didn't want them to have already.", "This.", "Also make sure everyone is named in your will even if you aren't giving them a dime.  It shows that you didn't just forget about them if you her family tries to use that tactic in court.  I'd even include nieces and nephews and cousins just to be safe.", "Except to tell them that their miserable religion ruined their relationship with him."]}
