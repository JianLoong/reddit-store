Mom and dad were never together, always just friends, since my dad is gay, but it just worked. When I was 7 my mom met her husband Matt and ever since he and my mom got serious I have known he has issues with my dad. It started out slight enough. He would tell people dad was \"my wife's friend\" and not that he was my dad. He also didn't correct anyone who wrongly assumed he was my dad. But then he asked me to spend Father's Day with him instead of my dad. It wasn't pushed exactly but the tone was he's not your dad but I could be kind of thing. Then my mom was in an accident when I was 9 and he tried to argue that I should stay with him instead of with my dad, even though legally, my dad was listed on my birth certificate and had legal rights to me and custody. It hurt my dad's relationship with mom a bit and it meant Matt was always to me someone who was trying to interfere where he didn't belong.\n\nMy teens were rough with stuff. But the final blow came when Matt showed up to a father/daughter event for Father's Day that I had not invited him to and that I was attending with my dad, and attempted to get my dad to leave. Then told him he was not married to mom nor was he my bio dad and he should have stepped aside so I could have a normal family.\n\nMy mom and Matt are invited to my wedding.

I told him he had earned his place in the shadows and he wasn't important enough for me to invite really, but mom had sort of made up for staying with him so he was going as a curtesy to her and nothing else.\n\nHe called me an ungrateful brat and said I shouldn't be so rude to him.\n\nI know what I said was cold so I ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1678191132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kxosh/aita_for_telling_my_moms_husband_he_has_earned/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wanted you to be his daughter but tried to get that by removing your dad instead of treating you like a daughter and letting the relationship develop.", "Hi, you may want to consider therapy, it seems you have some issues to deal with. You're an adult, she's your mother and he is her husband, that won't change. Treat them with respect that adults do to each other, you invited them to your wedding, are you going to be pleasant or use their presence aan excuse to ruin things? . It sounds like he cares for you and wanted to provide a stable life, is that so terrible?  \n\n I agree, it sounds like the grown ups have boundary issues with each other and you were dragged into it and now you are unable to accept love and you do sound bitter, you sound like a little child who is still struggling with the relationshis of your family. . I hope you find peace someday and realize how many people love you, you don't have to be defensive.\n\nNAH", "NTA he completely disrespected your relationship with your dad. One of the biggest things with being a step-parent is being flexible on how your partner's child relates to you and not pushing yourselves onto them. Especially here when you already had a father figure. Him acting like he knew what was best for you over the parents you already had was also really rude.", "NTA. He clearly has a problem with your da, yeah, and shouldnt be tolerated.", "NTA.\n\nTelling him he wasn't important enough to invite was maybe a little harsh but considering he has been minimalizing your dad, especially when he could have been co-parenting like a champ, it seems like this was building for a while now.", "Nta", "NTA- your mother is though, she should have nipped this in the bud years ago.", "ESH. Matt for pushing the issue and OP for treating him like crap for trying.", "NTA. Step parents shouldn\u2019t try to replace a parental figure that is already in a child\u2019s life. As long as that parental figure is active and present and maintains a healthy relationship. They especially shouldn\u2019t belittle the parent or attempt to actively push them out of their child\u2019s life. It doesn\u2019t matter if he isn\u2019t biologically your father, he is your parent. Matt needs to realize the more people who love, support and help a child grow the better. It isn\u2019t a fucking competition.", "NTA, disinvite him before he makes a scene at your wedding.", "NTA and he deserves the shadows he's in. Some people just doesn't get it and you are right with your approach. You don't have to put up with people you don't like or want to. Congrats on your wedding.", "Ungrateful for what? He did everything he could to drive a wedge between you and your father and tried to force you to be something you did not want. \n\nGiven his history\u2014showing up at an event to kosplay father\u2014you should uninvite him and tell your mom that you don\u2019t trust him not to cause a scene at your wedding.\n\nNTA.", "BAN HIM. NTA Holy shit I'm so sorry. That is so freaking creepy of Matt. Don't ever leave your kids alone with Matt and your Mom EVER. She should have nipped this in the bud long ago. I am deeply disturbed that she hasn't.", "Oh honey, this man crashed a father/daughter event and caused a scene. And you seriously think he's going to get all dressed up for your wedding and stay in the shadows like Batman? LMAO he's absolutely going to throw a tantrum. But will it be when someone else walks you down the aisle? Or when you do a father-daughter dance with dad? Or when close friends and family do toasts and speeches? How exciting.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Consider walking back the invite since it was a courtesy in the first place, his presence seems like it could only lead to more drama. It seems like he\u2019s done everything he could to drive a wedge between you and your father, instead of being a co/step parent.", "NTA. And you better than me cause he wouldn't be invited.", "NTA Your real Dad (the gay one who didn't conceive your or marry your mother) sounds awesome. And I bet he's proud of you.\n\nMatt had the opportunity to be assistant Dad. If he didn't push. But he wanted to be first prime Dad. \n\nTo the extent of crashing your father/daughter event and destroying the atmosphere. Even worse trying to deprive you of your real Dad's comforting and protection when you were vulnerable while your mother was sick.\n\nMatt is lucky he's even invited to the wedding.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s more than a little heart-breaking that had your Mom and Matt acted like adults, you could have had three people who loved you unconditionally. \n\nBut in my experience, kids really just need one person to be that for them. I\u2019m glad you had your dad to demonstrate that for you", "NTA great comeback", "ESH. I think Matt shouldn't push, but I would like to know why you have been so determined to treat him like an outsider in the family? Because I can't imagine that being fun for him either.", "NTA, and in fact, I'd rescind the invitation if I were you, or at least tell him it's on the table if he's going to continue to belittle you and your father.\n\nI'd also have some security at the wedding (a couple of your husband to be's groomsman or something) ready to remove him if he tries to disrupt the wedding or take your father's place.", "HTA he shouldnt be pishing u to think of him as ur father, you know who your father is and u have every right to have certain things be with YOUR dad. matt seems annoying and pushy. ur mom should have also said something about like how hes not your dad.", "Nta. Not even the slightest hint of one. If he was trying to force physical love on you then people would rightly be up in arms, he's trying to force emotional love on you. You've got a great dad which you care deeply for and he cares deeply for you. You don't need another dad. If matt hadn't been so pushy then I bet you'd have a good relationship now, he's ruined it though.", "NTA. Your mom\u2019s husband shouldn\u2019t have alienated your dad. Your dad earned the right to be your dad by stepping up to take the dad role. On the other hand your mom\u2019s husband should\u2019ve tried to earn his role by being supportive and respectful of your priorities and not competing with your dad.", "NTA.\n\nMatt did everything in his power to drive a wedge between you and the man you call dad. Loch stepped up to the role of dad and fulfills that to this day. Being married to the mother or father a child doesn't make you a dad. It's the time, effort and love that goes into the relationship that does.\n\nMatt wanted to be a father and in his desire did everything he shouldn't have done. He never respected the relationship you and your dad had and have. Something he should have done.\n\nHe maybe thought by marrying your mother he would automatically become a father and have the relationship that goes with it. When he found out that it wasn't that easy he did a lot to sour the relationship between the three of you.\n\nYou are not ungrateful. He is. He was rude,", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP had a father and mother's husband felt the need to insert himself and try to replace their father. OP is not wrong or \"a little child\" for not seeing him as a father figure. OP has a father and this man has no right to try and force a father/child relationship.
