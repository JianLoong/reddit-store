I feel it all the time over stupid shit like dudes being nice to my wife. I had to figure out why I was feeling what I was feeling because it feels natural and makes sense, to me but my perspective is warped from weird caveman genes telling me they want my woman and larder.

If he loves his wife and her child, then he will treat them with love, whether it's reciprocated or not. Because that's what love is.\n\nWhat Matt wants is secondary in importance to what OP wants. The fact that he demanded to be put first and then blamed her because she didn't comply makes him a raging AH.", ">I never understand why people do that. \n\nCan't speak for others but to me the role of father/mother can only be held by one person, to me this is as true as \"water is wet\".", "Territorial men are patriarchal men, and they're definitely homophobic.\n\nMatt is angry that the world sees him as secondary to a gay man.", "Legally speaking, your dad never had to adopt you because his name is on your birth certificate as your legal parent, just like your mom.\n\nThe courts don't care what the reasoning is. They look at the birth certificate, and it names the mother of the child and the father of the child. \n\nThat's a legal document that you would have to go to court to undo if you wanted somebody else to be your dad.", "Blows my mind that people who don't give a fuck about someone pretty much their entire lives then have the nerve to act all butt-hurt surprised when they don't give a fuck right back at them.", "Matt's reasoning is this:\n\nGay men can't be \"real\" fathers.\n\nMatt is hetero and married to the mother, so, by patriarchal rights, both the mom and daughter BELONG to him. He's in charge, on top, first.\n\nAny child who is offered the chance to have a \"real\" - aka non-gay - dad must jump at the chance, gratefully and gleefully leaving behind inferior dad wannabes in favor of the \"real\" dad who has arrived just in time to save the day.\n\nPlacing a gay man higher up in the family hierarchy than himself is the worst insult imaginable and will make everyone automatically see Matt as weak.\n\nEverything would be perfect if the child would only SUBMIT to her new \"savior dad.\" If she doesn't, everything will suck and it will all be the child's fault.

Divorce is such a hassle to accomplish the same thing really XD", "INFO: You\u2019ve articulated all the things he did to alienate you (it\u2019s plenty of shitty stuff!) but what did he do that might have been positive or fatherly? Did he provide? Did you live in a house, wear clothes, and eat food he paid for, etc.? Did he pay medical bills, drive you places, support your education or act as a caregiver in any way? Or did he truly do nothing at all except try to distance you and Loch?\n\nNot saying the man deserves to be your Dad or that the way he behaved regarding Loch was at all OK. But as he offered to pay for your wedding, which is a very generous thing to do, I would guess he\u2019s done some other nice things for you over the years. \n\nI could be entirely wrong. Offering to pay for your wedding could be the first and only nice thing he ever did for you.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of space for him to exist between good guy and total AH. And it\u2019s totally valid for you not to want him to play a role in your life or wedding. It\u2019s also possible that there are good things he\u2019s done that you refuse to recognize, which, from his perspective, would make you ungrateful.\n\nLife is rarely so clean cut as AHs and victims. \n\nYou aren\u2019t an AH for not giving him a role in your wedding, but I do wonder if, given your animosity towards this man, whether you are able to see all of who he is or only the worst parts of him.", "But he didn\u2019t want to share the role or be an extra Dad he wanted to push OPs Dad out of her life.  He told OPs Dad that he needed to step back and allow OP to have a normal life.", "He didn\u2019t try to have a stepfather relationship. He only wanted to force out her father.

You have to share or coordinate holidays and vacations; you can't just up and move to another city for that cool job offer because you have to work it out with the other parent.\n\nMost people don't take it to the extreme my divorced parents and mom's husband did, with my dad joining the same church my mom and husband attended (with us kids, when we lived at home) and now all three sing in the choir together; but it's nice to celebrate holidays and birthdays together.\n\nWhen my brother got cancer and went through chemo, there were three parents to offer help and support and take him to appointments, sit with him during treatments, keep up with his meds, etc.\n\nMy dad has no \"relation\" or obligation to my stepdad's kids, but they all know each other and we spend so much time together that my stepsinlings' kids have an extra grandpa.\n\nMatt could have had a wonderful relationship with OP *and both of OP's parents*... but instead chose to throw his weight around and managed to not only prevent and relationship from developing between Matt and OP, but he also destroyed much of the relationship between OP and her mom.", "In my life experience, people who try to FORCE others to love them don't understand what love is and aren't really capable of it.", "Matt doesn't love her. If he did, he wouldn't be making her responsible for his insecurities and disrespecting her when she won't submit. \n\nWhen you bully children, they tend not to want a close relationship with you.
