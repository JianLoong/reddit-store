If this was 2 years ago she wouldn't be on the guest list in any capacity either. Still not fully there with her but it's better than it was and she acknowledges and owns up to what she needs to now, at least.", "Exactly! Have your entire bridal party on alert and ready to kick him out. Also make it clear to him that this dance is reserved for you and your father and you will not hesitate to remove him from the wedding. Also NTA.", "I hadn't thought about him causing a scene. You're absolutely right. There should be multiple people at the wedding wary of his antics and looking to notify or run interference if something occurs.\n\nMy family has a rambunctious relative and had several people keeping an eye out during my sister's wedding. Nothing happened, thankfully. And while I felt a little bad about assuming/preparing for the worst. Not as bad as I would have felt if the worst did happen.", "He did explain it. But not in a way someone with a loving dad wants to hear. He made it clear that he wanted to be the dad. My only dad. And that was not something he could ever be. I think the problem wasn't that he wanted us to be close. It's that he wanted me for himself and didn't care about the fact he would be taking someone away from me who I loved and relied on. Not very good parent material with that.", "i think that him \"not being important enough\" was actually was too nice tbh", "Custody was 50-50. Dad paid most expenses. Dad also started my college fund, had a separate savings for daily stuff started for me, before I was even born. Dad would often give mom money for me before she married. He'd make sure we were both taken care of. After he still provided for me on his time and made sure I was taken care of when needed. It changed things slightly because mom had Matt after and didn't need dad's help. But my dad was very much involved, active and took care of me.", "No dude, there's definitely an AH here and it's Matt. Not sure why you think OP can't accept love, this is way more about someone trying to force a relationship and put weight on it that isn't fair. Matt doesn't get to dictate who OP's dad is and doesn't even have legal standing. He's also the one being douchey about not having a role in her wedding. Most people who go to weddings don't have special roles, but he thinks he's entitled to one. This is such a weird reaction.", "Found the step dads Reddit account!", "Because he tried to force her to accept him as her father and force his wife's coparent out of her life. Stepparents don't have that right.", "Some people are not cut out for the job. If you become a stepparent and try to push a parent out and are jealous of not taking their place then it's not a role you should be in.", "Thing is, OP has a parent. Two, in fact. Step parent literally could\u2019ve just chosen to butt out like a sane person and all would\u2019ve been well.", "He came into a situation where a dad was already involved. And instead of trying to see how he could be helpful and supportive, he's done the opposite.", "What should OP be thankful for?", "All this man needed to do was say, \u201cI understand that you\u2019ve already got a father, and I want you to continue you to view him as your father. I am not here to, and don\u2019t want to, replace him. I am here to love and support your mother, and if you ever need anything from me I\u2019ll support you as well.\u201d\n\nIf he had approached it like that instead of demanding, as OP says he did, to be her \u201conly dad\u201d, I bet they would have had a good, respectable relationship.", "Just FYI, thats literally the role of the best man. He is an honor guard for the groom. In the past they would be armed.", "You're NTA. But if you're in the right headspace, I'd suggest looking at this again. \n\nYou say your mom owns that she acted wrong in the past - but what is she doing now to stop that hurt? Is she throwing her hands up and saying it's been so long, you know how he is, just ignore him. Or is she actively backing you up? Calling him out on his behaviour? Stepping in? Because I don't even think he should've been able to talk to you to have this \"in the shadows\" conversation. What's your mom doing about this? How is she going to protect you from him at your wedding? Has she considered what will happen if he makes a scene? \n\nI'd think all this over carefully before assuming your mom is fully on your side here.", "NTA but we'll definitely need an update on how the wedding went. Oh and congrats!", "I see this all the time. Matt is feeling territorial. Your his wife's daughter and this other man is around his home in his perspective. He doesn't want to be your dad, he wants your dad out of his territory because it makes him feel insecure. Matt imagines if your dad wasn't gay your mom would have chosen him. It's male insecurity. I feel it all the time over stupid shit like dudes being nice to my wife. I had to figure out why I was feeling what I was feeling because it feels natural and makes sense, to me but my perspective is warped from weird caveman genes telling me they want my woman and larder. I had to work on not being territorial around other men. Like when old dudes see young guys loiter near there homes and get paranoid there gona be robbed.", ">\"Methany\"\n\nlmao!", "Right? Entitled relatives crashing back into people's lives for big events. Why are stories like this so common?\n\nBut it's so great that the rest of your family kept SIL unawares so as not to ruin her wedding.", "SMIL? \n\nCloser to mother's Boyfriend of only 3 years than her own father...\n\nThe 3 options there were:\n\n1. He was her mother's Boyfriend for a lot longer than just the 3 years divorced\n* Mother is a master manipulator\n* Father did something heinous.\n\nAnd ding, ding, ding, we have a winner with option number 3.\n\nLike, seriously... Dude must have seriously destroyed the relationship with his daughter for it to have already been so bad that showing up with Methany and being a crying mess at her wedding weren't the events which ruined the relationship.", "Tell her to wrangle her spouse or you\u2019ll uninvite them both.\n\nI also support getting security of some kind; give them his photo with instructions that he is not permitted \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d and to remove him if he tries to make a speech or interfere with the father-daughter dance. And any other things you want him to but out of.", "Yet she's still letting him act like this and making you handle it? She should tell him to stfu", "Thank you. Do you think he wants you to himself or is it possible he wanted to foster a better relationship?\nIt's hard to tell someone, I want a relationship like you have with your dad and it makes me feel inadequate. Earlier, I was nicely trying to say, he's insecure and fear being vulnerable. \n\nI have two dads, I'm closer too my stepdad. My stepdad was there all my life. I have to balance my relationships in a way that neither realizes the other exist. And it's not like they don't know they exist but they don't feel in competition or that they are sharing. \n\nWhile it's easy to admonish him, one day when you're older you'll better understand your parents. That's life we shift roles and it's hard to see it now. He's reacting emotionally. It's annoying, frustrating, and hard to love someone who does that but it takes emotional intelligence and patience to overcome. \n\nThere's a book called Art of Communicating by Thick Nhat Han. It's dry but it does a great job of having compassionate conversations. Not all people can have that conversation and you may not want to have it. Check it out and see if it can help you. Sometimes heart to hearts can really make a huge difference. The sooner you can have the convo the better because, I fear he'll act out at the wedding. I wish the best for you and your relationship. Congratulations on your wedding and having a dad that stepped up to the plate.", "Sadly, one of the least of the scary reasons is the awful homophobia.", "Thanks. Very clear NTA for me then.", "So, to put this in very unemotional terms: It's not like your dad just stole you and got all that sweet affection for nothing, he paid for the right to be your legal father and invested years of time, money and effort into his relationship with you and into your well-being before Matt even met you.", "So you\u2019re dad is a man who just decided to step and be your father? That is amazing a what he\u2019s done for you, no wonder you love him so much. Fuck Matt lol", "You are not the asshole here in any way", "If your mom married him he\u2019s not a random man, sounds like Matt sucks and you seem very immature, ESH", "Yup, I had an evil stepmother situation and am permanently estranged from my father because of it. I've always had a bit of a dream of being a stepparent so I could be an actually good one. Stepparents should be bonus parents, not pushy attempts at replacement.", "She had 4 total teeth, and they were torn the eff up. It was bad. She also wasn't coherent, nobody actually knew her or her name (FIL had just apparently found a random person to be his +1, which was a whole debacle in and of itself, as this was 2020)...it was phenomenal. \n\nDuring the father daughter dance, my SIL had to awkwardly comfort him while he sobbed profusely into her shoulder.", "Because people feel entitled to their family for some reason. \n\nI've mentioned offhand in other comments how I have a male cousin, whom I have never been particularly close to, who took it as a *personal offense* that I changed my name when I got married. He decided that this means I don't have \"pride\" in my family, that I have disowned them, and that I'm a disgrace because I didn't ask all of my male family members their permission before changing my name.\n\nTo be clear, my family is white and garden variety Southern Baptist. (ETA: I say this, due to some stereotypical comments I've gotten in the past about certain races and religions, in response to this story)", "He hasn't earned the title of my parent. He's just the man my mom is married to. He's not my family (at least not someone who will ever be loved like family) and he's not worth my time or energy. I have no appreciation for the man. The day he's no longer part of my life will be a very happy day.\n\nIt's not possible he just wanted to foster a better relationship. I will never believe that was it.", "Yes. Once he told my mom he would be my dad, he was. He was even there for her in a way many would not be. He was holding her hand while I was born, was there to support her in the first few weeks, with them sharing a room. Mom told me before he did most of the night time feeds and diaper changes so she could rest. When I graduated high school I realized how much money he had saved for me. He also gave me an extended family. I have grandparents and an aunt and uncle thanks to him. And they love and treat me just like I'm their bio kid.", "Thank you.", "He's a random man in terms of his place in dictating my relationship with my own dad. He's also a random man when he tries to interfere in things that are not his business, when he is not yet established as a parental figure in my life. And in doing so he made sure he was never a parental figure for me.", "Still, better safe than sorry. \n\nYou've made yourself clear that he would not be at the center stage of your wedding, and if he's stomped on your boundaries before (with the father daughter dance) he will very likely try doing it again, this time with a bigger audience.\n\nOther redditors have already given a very helpful suggestion: have people (groomsmen, staff, other friends) on watch to prevent him from making a scene, and if necessary escort him off the premises.\n\nYou deserve a wonderful day celebrating with the two men you keep in your heart rn: your amazing dad and your soon to be husband. You don't need the interference of people who aren't important to you. Let them fade into the shadows where they belong. NTA.", "You think she's wrong for knowing who dad is, who step-dad is, and the difference between the two?", "Fair enough", "You are bound and fucking determined to misquote me, aren't you? I'm saying that she isn't the asshole in this situation. Now back off.", "You said ESH.", "I think you're replying to the wrong person?", "Indeed. We're on the same page, but I had THOUGHT I was replying to the first comment on this tree, not realizing I had gone one level down. And the Android app doesn't show the whole tree in alerts to responses, so I only now realized the oops."]}
