Luckily, about 10 minutes after that person leaves they are perfectly happy being parented by any other adult who they have a long standing relationship with. \n\nIs boating safe for a 2 year old? Matter of opinion I guess, but if an adult doesn\u2019t invite your 2 year old on their adult boat trip because they are concerned for safety, you don\u2019t get to override that decision. I assume the guys were planning to drink and relax and not have to constantly be on watch to prevent a 2 year old from drowning or getting injured on the motor or some other part of the boat.\n\nIMO it boils down to whether your husband taking a day \u201coff\u201d is acceptable within the context of your relationship. Has he given you days off where he takes full responsibility of the household and child? If not, will he?\n\nBy focusing on whether or not some other adults should invite your 2 year old on their boat trip, you do come across a little demanding \u2026 why should other people be forced to go out of their way for your child? I think, although I\u2019m not sure, maybe your issue is more that you need help with your child due to a phase the kid is going through.

The water might be too rough.\n\nTaking the little one with them  on a boat would be a fun time for no one. The will probably be out for hours. Too long for a small child to be in the sun. The men will pee over the side of the boat. What will the toddler do? The kid will get bored after half an hour and want to go back. The men would have to cut short their trip or drop him off and maybe not have enough time to do what they set out to do.  A child changes the vibe of a social setting.

Aside from the fact a 2 year old is not going to have any fun getting badly sunburnt and being bored while dad and friends hang out (and probably want to have a beer or two), does he even have a life vest? Because I've never seen ones made for infants. \nYou can deal with the baby crying for the sake of him not going flying off a motorboat and drowning.\n\nSounds like you're having a harder time coping with your baby being mildly unhappy for an hour or so than the baby is without dad.", "It is absolutely dangerous and you\u2019d have to be hyper vigilant at all times with a 2 year old on a boat. Sure, it\u2019s possible but it isn\u2019t very fun or relaxing. Let them go have some toddler free time for a while. YTA", "You are forcing your extended family to a situation were they don't want to be. At the same time you are making your husband an undesirable company to them. Next time, they might not even invite him just to avoid babysitting and hanging around a toddler. If you don't want him to do activities on his own better not use your son as an excuse.", "NTA - the amount of triggered bros is hilarious. Nice work!", "A 2 year old does not belong on a boat with a bunch of people, dangerous!!!!\u00d7", "YTA even with a life jacket, a kid on board is everyone's responsibility, not all in, sorry it's a no. \n\nReason being, life jackets for children under 5, especially in those who can't swim or aren't trained to wear them, can kill them. They don't automatically flip the child off their face and if fitted wrong, keep them stuck. No adding floating arm things or whatever don't help. \n\nI get the want for him to go, he's going to be upset as hell without dad. This is one time you should suck it up if your not going to join in. It's just such a risky activity. \n\nAnd look, sorry guys for saying this... But y'all can be fucks and find out just having some fun. 3 men in the boat, when I know how easy it is to create wake and then get back over it to get air and as soon as responsible people weren't looking I personally did it etc lol..... Sorry it's a no from me.", "As someone who has a 2 year old I would not take him on a boat he would prob enjoy it for a few minutes them be 1. Scared by how fast it\u2019s going 2. Try to move around and make me nervous about him falling overboard 3. Become sick from all the motion causing the tip to end. \n\nThe adult cousins probable wanted to have sone fun time on the boat which will not be happening with a 2year old on it. Give them a break from your child as it seems like he\u2019s been glued to his dad the vacation. \n\nYTA", "Especially to take a toddler on a boat. Maybe the cousin doesn't have kid-sized life jacket, maybe the kid would get scared if it's motor boat and they go fast. And a toddler probably isn't going to be content in a confined space with a bunch of guys who want to hang out.", "The husband wasn't even there for this conversation though.", "My husband was fine with taking him. He doesn't get to spend a lot of time with our son normally so he's happy that he has this time.", "My father-in-law owns the boat, not the cousins, and he agreed with me that they could take my son.", "I could've and would've watched him if my husband wanted me to but a big part of the reason my husband took time off work and we came to see his family was so he could spend more time with our son since he typically works long hours so he doesn't get that time at home.", "I never tattled. He was in the room so heard the entire conversation and decided to join in himself.", "If the child has been going through a \"dad is my favourite person\" phase, and sticking to him all the time, maybe this *is* the much needed break dad needs to relax and decompress, though.", "Right? I\u2019m the mom. My 2 year old prefers me; our oldest preferred dad at the same age. \n\nTheir preferences make zero impact as to how we split childcare duties which is 50/50. We remind them they don\u2019t always get to choose and the preferred parent will be back/come kiss you good night/has to go/is seeing their friends/ etc", "I hate to be \"that person\", but I can imagine five years from now, OP posting something like \"AITA for demanding my son be invited to a birthday party? Last year, he blew out the candles of four other kids cakes, but he's special!\"\n\nJust accept that not every outing has to be a family thing, leave the kid for an hour or two away from dad- the kid won't catch on fire, I promise lol.", "A great memory for a two year old? He\u2019s almost certainly not going to remember it", "settle down elizabeth they are going on a boat not corn holing each other or have 5 mistresses on the boat with them lol", "I would even argue, no child whatsoever should be allowed on any boat without a life jacket, full stop. And a 2 year old doesn't have his balance. If he's not being held at all times he's going to go flying.", "You\u2019re making huge assumptions here that because OP is mom she\u2019s the default parent. \n\nDad was bathing son. \n\nDad can go have kid free time. \n\nThen mom can have kid free time. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about split of duties it\u2019s about letting a toddler\u2019s preferences call the shots on adult visits", "Kids on a boat are absolutely safe with the right conditions and a life jacket.  I took mine on one at 6 no. Is it a pontoon with rails or is it a fishing boat with dirty fish hooks all around?", "Second this. My son is three right now and is attached to my husband, too, but my husband also deserves time away to do fun stuff without him. Plus when a toddler is attached to one parent, the typical advice is for them to spend quality time with the other, too.\n\nI think OP accusing the cousins of \"making stuff up\" so the kid had to stay behind is a bit much, too. He'd need a life jacket, and I'm betting they didn't have one for him.", "You're attacking a toddler for being attached to their father?", "Lmao no danger to a child on a boat? What a fucking joke", "It seems you\u2019ve let your inexperience and lack of knowledge on boats affect your judgement. Sunscreen and UV clothing exists as well so that comment was unnecessary. Children are on boats all the time, and there are life jackets made specifically for infants.\n\nOp is TA but speaking on subjects you know nothing about for the sake of a Reddit post is lame.", ">At the same time you are making your husband an undesirable company to them. Next time, they might not even invite him just to avoid babysitting and hanging around a toddler.\n\n100%.", "OP seems like the type to inform people how they feel and what they should think lol. I\u2019m sure its always been a \u201cI know what\u2019s best, regardless of what you think/feel\u201d kinda thing with OP.", "That does not make it safe. And just because your husband is your son's favourite at the moment doesn't mean you should give in to him being glued to his side every second.", "Yeah, and back in your father in laws day, children were out by themselves til sundown, beating your child was normal, you could ride in a car without a seatbelt (hell, car seats didn\u2019t even exist)?\n\nDo you do any of these things or do you think that maybe, idk as part of evolution/society, we\u2019ve learned things since then", "This isn\u2019t even about safety IMO \n\nWhy are you so unwilling to allow your husband adult time with his cousins? \n\nAre you so incapable of caring for your son for an afternoon??", "Yes probably to shut up your whining.  Way to spoil everyone\u2019s vacation.", "Oh I see. I take back the last part.\n\nDoes the boat have a life jacket that fits your son? Does he know how to behave on a boat? Has he done it before?", "For the dad \ud83d\ude44", "Wow, uhm I meant drinking heavily,  maybe some drugs, maybe flirting with other women,  but, carry on assuming lol", "You\u2019re right.  I am. And I shouldn\u2019t. It seems to always go that way. And reading that he can spend more time with him made me think she was.  So you\u2019re right on that.  \n\nI do feel like that preference will go away. And having that fun with your kid is not something that makes her an AH.  \nPersonally I would rather not deal with the extreme screaming or upset that comes along with the kid not getting to hang out with dad. \nDoes this come from my own personal PPA/PPD issues ? Probably. But that is my current opinion.", "Six months would be safer than two: you can hold a baby that age and they\u2019re not going anywhere. It is incredibly easy to lose control of a toddler and on a boat that could be deadly.", "Er, am I? Where?", "You can't fucking read. \nThere is NO MORE danger to a child being on a boat then an adult. \n\n1)Adults can go overboard. Some also can't fucking swim.\n2) Anything heavy can fall and hurt someone of any size. \n3) Rope is dangerous not on the water. \n\nOhh no. We have to be *gasp* responsible. Ohh the horror. \n\nYou're a fucking joke.", "infants really shouldn't be out in the sun for long periods of time, even with sunscreen, their skin is more sensitive than that of a child's or adults. whether or not I'm some boat doctor doesn't change my verdict or the fact that a two year old on a boat is probably not a good idea.", "Yes it does. He's been on a boat when he was 7 months so this was only his second time going on one. My husband would've explained to him how to behave and kept an eye on him.", "Yeah wrangling a two year old on a boat sounds like a ton of fun. Who wouldn\u2019t prefer that to spending stress free time with their cousins", "We have a lakehouse and boat with kids of all ages so there have also been toddlers. There needs to be an adult assigned to the child at all times and like I said a pontoon with a gate is ideal and it never hits higher speeds. A certified life jacket is the most critical safety feature. It is made to keep the head of an unconscious person above water.", "As I mentioned in my comment I agree that OP is the asshole, so not trying to change judgment. \n\nThe length of time they were intending on being in the boat isn\u2019t mentioned and neither are the weather conditions. And thank you I\u2019m aware of children having sensitive skin but it has no relevance to the conversation. The cousins just wanted guy time. They brought up the \u201csafety concerns\u201d as an excuse to avoid saying they wanted guy time. \nI also never said you had to be an expert in boating just that your comment was ignorant of the topic. \n\n\nThe goal of AITA isn\u2019t to make up your own scenario it\u2019s to read and infer. You have a good one.", "Someone who loves spending time with their kid, maybe?", "It meets your personal definition of \u2018safe\u2019, fine, even if I don\u2019t agree. But even by your definition, her husband would need to spend the entire time, every second, supervising his child and keeping him safe, not spending time with his cousins, which is the whole point of the outing."]}
