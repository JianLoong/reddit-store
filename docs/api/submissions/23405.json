Luckily, about 10 minutes after that person leaves they are perfectly happy being parented by any other adult who they have a long standing relationship with. \n\nIs boating safe for a 2 year old? Matter of opinion I guess, but if an adult doesn\u2019t invite your 2 year old on their adult boat trip because they are concerned for safety, you don\u2019t get to override that decision. I assume the guys were planning to drink and relax and not have to constantly be on watch to prevent a 2 year old from drowning or getting injured on the motor or some other part of the boat.\n\nIMO it boils down to whether your husband taking a day \u201coff\u201d is acceptable within the context of your relationship. Has he given you days off where he takes full responsibility of the household and child? If not, will he?\n\nBy focusing on whether or not some other adults should invite your 2 year old on their boat trip, you do come across a little demanding \u2026 why should other people be forced to go out of their way for your child? I think, although I\u2019m not sure, maybe your issue is more that you need help with your child due to a phase the kid is going through.

(I have three children, and 2 was my favourite age). \n\nI am guessing that part of the reason they said it would be dangerous for a toddler on the boat is because they didn't have a properly fitting vest. The water might be too rough.\n\nTaking the little one with them  on a boat would be a fun time for no one. The will probably be out for hours. Too long for a small child to be in the sun. The men will pee over the side of the boat. What will the toddler do? The kid will get bored after half an hour and want to go back. The men would have to cut short their trip or drop him off and maybe not have enough time to do what they set out to do.  A child changes the vibe of a social setting.

We have no idea how busy dad is or what accidents lie in the future. People need to consider this more with children. Memories are important too, just as much as having free time.

His cousins are likely trying to spend some quality time with him, which just won\u2019t be happening with the lil guy around. There are other ample opportunities and activities for the uncle, dad, and boy to bond over(even a boat outing if he is a bit older), but if he is going through a phase of only a particular parent, it\u2019s super necessary for the opposite parent to pickup and make sure they not get their share of time, but also enable their SO to still have fun and get that much needed free time.

She knows her son is completely safe and in good hands and that gives peace of mind. That matters, too.

No one else is obliged to spend time with your child. That's your role. If your kid is going through an overly attached phase, then it sounds like your husband could also use a break on his own.
