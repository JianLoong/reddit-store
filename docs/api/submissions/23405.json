Luckily, about 10 minutes after that person leaves they are perfectly happy being parented by any other adult who they have a long standing relationship with. \n\nIs boating safe for a 2 year old? Matter of opinion I guess, but if an adult doesn\u2019t invite your 2 year old on their adult boat trip because they are concerned for safety, you don\u2019t get to override that decision. I assume the guys were planning to drink and relax and not have to constantly be on watch to prevent a 2 year old from drowning or getting injured on the motor or some other part of the boat.\n\nIMO it boils down to whether your husband taking a day \u201coff\u201d is acceptable within the context of your relationship. Has he given you days off where he takes full responsibility of the household and child? If not, will he?\n\nBy focusing on whether or not some other adults should invite your 2 year old on their boat trip, you do come across a little demanding \u2026 why should other people be forced to go out of their way for your child? I think, although I\u2019m not sure, maybe your issue is more that you need help with your child due to a phase the kid is going through.

The water might be too rough.\n\nTaking the little one with them  on a boat would be a fun time for no one. The will probably be out for hours. Too long for a small child to be in the sun. The men will pee over the side of the boat. What will the toddler do? The kid will get bored after half an hour and want to go back. The men would have to cut short their trip or drop him off and maybe not have enough time to do what they set out to do.  A child changes the vibe of a social setting.

And didn't OP say part of his going on this vacation was to spend more time with his son?\n\nI really don't get why parents are automatically assholes for wanting to spend time with their kids. Cousins could have just said never mind, bad idea if they didn't want to spend time with their cousin if it meant also spending time with his kid", "His son is his family\u2026 weird that you are excluding him from the family in this context", "Yeah, the child IS his family. And, is a higher priority in his life than the cousins.", "\u201cEventually my fil\u201d. In other words he was sick of listening to fighting. Which wouldn\u2019t have happened if OP wouldn\u2019t be an asshole and actually watch her child.", "that's really what it is for me, that the mom can't concieve of not giving into a toddler. Babies cry when they don't get their way, it's kind of their main thing aside from pooping and handing people wet cheetos.", "With his CHILD. You know, one of the primary relationships in his life. Cousins are now a much lower priority. They seem to have trouble understanding that.", "It's the xxxxing Catalina wine mixer.", "Haha, I\u2019m not quite that bad!

I felt sooo bad for the other guests.", "Maybe they just wanted a boys day on a boat where they can freely talk about things that aren't 'kid friendly' and have a few beers. How is wanting to hang out with someone without their kid somehow a sexist act? If the mom wanted to have a girls day and her friends said \"can you please not bring your kid with us while we get margs and hang out?\" would you also think so negatively of these women? Parents are allowed to have a social life without their kid there 24/7. It's actually very healthy and important for the kids development otherwise they are at a higher chance of developing separation anxiety.", "OP made the decision for her husband. That alone makes OP TA. There was no discussion with the husband. Nothing. OP just said no.", "Did the dad even get a chance to share his opinion? It sounds like he didn't hear about it at all, so he couldn't share whether he wanted to go only with his son, just with cousins, or not go. That's what makes OP TA, in my opinion. (Also, her discounting safety concerns. Kids can be safe but they may not be comfortable with what would need to be done in an emergency. Has dad taken a water safety course for infants/toddlers? We don't know.)", "What if the cousins wanted to spend time with their adult cousin catching up without a kid around? I love my niece to death and definitely love seeing her when I visit my sister and bil, and definitely understand that 95% of the time she will be there.

But they just need to be honest about it, and not phrase it differently and blame the other parent.", "Also how are all these people ignoring the fact thT she said her own husband wanted to spend more time with his son? People jumping on top of themselves to call her a shrew", "I think perhaps she did want a vacation. It was an already planned vacation to hubbys family vacation home. \n\nShe needn\u2019t be facetious about it  and change it to \u201chubs needs spending more time with their son\u201d-where he can\u2019t even spend a few hours away with his family. \n\nIf that was really what she wanted (hubs spending more time with their son) she should have planned a vacation with just the three of them. \n\nMommy should be honest and not gaslight her husband.", "Well, he didn\u2019t have to plan a vacation to see his son, he gets to do that everyday. Why are you being so disingenuous with your statement?", "They want to go on a quick boat ride lol. He isn\u2019t spending the whole vacation together.

The boat thing feels almost like a red herring, honestly.", "\ud83d\ude02 yep you are OP just accept you are the AH", "POW!", "I had a toddler who was attached to me and other people decided to give me a break too and took care of the kid. It\u2019s healthy for them to also see that dad will come back and not completely shackle the parent even if they are really nice about it.\n\nOP sounds annoying. I would have been happy to give my husband some time off with the guys. Sounds like he\u2019s a great guy too and would likely give her some time off too, if she wants to go with the girls.\n\nChildless time is important for all parents. And being with family would likely give them some time too if grandparents watch the kid etc. \n\nI find moms like OP to be insufferable and I\u2019m sure the family now thinks that too. FIL stepped in too and he sounds like a stand up guy also but likely he sees what\u2019s up too with OP and doesn\u2019t want to make this cause marital rifts.

Dad took time off work to visit family so he could Spend It With His Kid. OP could be hiding any other fact, we don't know! Everyone is asking Me like I or any of you have any clue past a reddit post what's going on. I didn't even make a judgement because I said more info on what dad wanted was needed. OP stated the vacation was for kid time with family. So it Sounds, from what we have been Given So Far, like dad wanted boat time with kid and fam, and cousins wanted drinking hang time.", "They did the very normal thing of taking a family vacation and trying to get one-on-one time in as well.\n\nWhen the kids are small, vacations are often tricky. \n\nI don't think \"gaslighting\" applies here, but maybe I'm wrong.", "He actually did plan a vacation to spend quality time with his son according to OP. Wanting your child to spend quality time with your family is also normal. Parents take their children on vacations all the time to see family. Why does he have to choose between spending time with his son or his cousins? Why can\u2019t he spend time with all of them at the same time?", "Why does he keep doing that?", "Yes it's very important for parents! You can't be a good parent if you never give yourself a break no matter how amazing you are. No one can be at their prime without recharging. It's hard for sure to see a kid upset if dad goes away but it's so vital they learn it's ok and nothing bad will happen. I hope op is doing it in her mind for the kid and not in the mentality of \"no one does anything around here!\" Mentality because clearly this guy seems very involved.", "OP sounds super annoying. Why would you force a child on a group of people who clearly don\u2019t want the child around? Probably because she wanted a break from the kid.", "You might have a good idea what their answer would be, but you never know for sure and it's always better to ask first than assume whenever you're able. \n\nShe wanted her son to go with his dad because the son always wants the dad, but doesn't the dad deserve the chance to go alone if he wants or at least the chance to make that decision himself? It sounds like the son has been around his dad almost the whole time during this trip, so just like a mom who is around her kid all the time deserves a break, even when the kid is attached to her hip (I've been that mom), the dad does, too.", "As opposed to asking the husband and seeing what he says. For all we know, the husband wouldn\u2019t have even wanted to go on the boat, regardless whether it was with or without the son.", "Same. Dad and cousins can wait till the two year old is asleep to smoke the devils lettuce", "POW! POW!", "Almost sounds like thats a decision the dad should make and not the cousins.
