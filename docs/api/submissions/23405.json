Luckily, about 10 minutes after that person leaves they are perfectly happy being parented by any other adult who they have a long standing relationship with. \n\nIs boating safe for a 2 year old? Matter of opinion I guess, but if an adult doesn\u2019t invite your 2 year old on their adult boat trip because they are concerned for safety, you don\u2019t get to override that decision. I assume the guys were planning to drink and relax and not have to constantly be on watch to prevent a 2 year old from drowning or getting injured on the motor or some other part of the boat.\n\nIMO it boils down to whether your husband taking a day \u201coff\u201d is acceptable within the context of your relationship. Has he given you days off where he takes full responsibility of the household and child? If not, will he?\n\nBy focusing on whether or not some other adults should invite your 2 year old on their boat trip, you do come across a little demanding \u2026 why should other people be forced to go out of their way for your child? I think, although I\u2019m not sure, maybe your issue is more that you need help with your child due to a phase the kid is going through.

Yes, I know, he was busy caring for your child when the conversation took place, but he did have the opportunity to speak some time before they left. Did you let him have a say at all?\n\nTwo year olds cannot always have what they want. Fortunately, they are also quite easy to distract if you give them another interesting option. (I have three children, and 2 was my favourite age). \n\nI am guessing that part of the reason they said it would be dangerous for a toddler on the boat is because they didn't have a properly fitting vest. The water might be too rough.\n\nTaking the little one with them  on a boat would be a fun time for no one. The will probably be out for hours. Too long for a small child to be in the sun. The men will pee over the side of the boat. What will the toddler do? The kid will get bored after half an hour and want to go back. The men would have to cut short their trip or drop him off and maybe not have enough time to do what they set out to do.  A child changes the vibe of a social setting.
