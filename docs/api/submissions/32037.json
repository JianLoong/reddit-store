But if that would've worked, they would've surely done that before your dog almost died.", "NTA. You spared yourself from a Y T A because you did give him a clear warning, in front of your parents. They had the chance to object to it, and they didn't. I remember reading that 7 is the age of reason. So more than likely would have understood that if he doesn't want his Lego thrown away, he needs to not leave them outside. And the life of the dog is more important than Lego, which is just plastic. \n\nAs some have said, it would have been better to hide them. But of course I can say that with hindsight. You get a pass for not thinking of that when the life of your dog was at the forefront of your mind.", "ESH.

You should have picked up the LEGOs (so your dog would not swallow it again), take it straight to your parents and asked them how did they wanted to deal with this.\n\nI do have some sympathy for your situation, though, because I get the feeling that you somehow knew taking the LEGOs to your parents would amount to no real consequences for your brother.", "Your parents are TA they're lack of taking action hurt your dog and it could've happened again, YTA because you could've locked the legos up or something instead of trashing them", "NTA\nthe only thing you could\u2019ve done better is to donate them to a goodwill or something, the toys deserve a better owner", "ESH.\n\nYou have every right to protect your dog, but you just haven't thought this through.\n\nFirst, you aren't his parent. Second, he's seven. One wild threat isn't going to change his behaviour. Third, if a piece of Lego sends your dog to the hospital, what else is he eating that could send you back there? There are going to be other inedible things in your yard. You need another plan to look after him.\n\nMost importantly, you have made things worse without solving your problem. Do you really think he won't get more Lego??? You need to talk this out before it just escalates further.", "INFO- when you were 9/10 did your parents throw away any of your toys because the new baby could eat them and die or did they remind you to pick up/pick up after you if you forgot? \n\nIf they picked up after you more than a SINGLE time then major YTA.  If they employed the same draconian methods and threw out your airbuds for leaving them on the couch where baby could reach then ESH. \n\nPart of being a responsible parent- even a pet parent, since you make it clear that it\u2019s YOUR dog, is supervision. Does it suck when someone leaves something out that can hurt a loved family member, absolutely. Does it warrant destruction of property- no. The dog is your responsibility, not your brothers but you seem more interested in punishing your brother for not looking out for YOUR dog than actually protecting your dog.", "Downvote me all you want for this, but: ESH. He is a child. it's your parents' duty to do this, not yours, that'swhy they suck. But you just threw away your parents' money. Do you have any idea how expensive Lego actually is?? You could have just hidden it??

Lego edges and corners are extremely sharp, and if it\u2019s agony to step on one - imagine swallowing some. \n\nI, however, would not have thrown them away outright. I would have put all the pieces into a bag and put them away until such a time your brother is more responsible.

He's probably going to be the one to hold onto a grudge for longest.\n\nYour parents suck for being oblivious to the situation and not taking a more active role. This was an easily-avoidable situation had they been more diligent.\n\nI think you're gonna have to chalk this one up to \"a bump in the road for the family as time goes on.\" Life isn't all smooth sailing and hopefully you can all forgive each other and move on with life.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the important thing is keeping your dog from dying and keeping your family from incurring more expensive vet bills. If that means throwing out the toys that your younger brother can't be bothered to maintain, then that's what has to happen.", "YTA. \n\nYou are a sibling, not the parent. If you want your dog safe then you speak to your parents about helping your brother clean up or YOU help your brother clean up. He is 7, not 17.

A 7 year old isn't *quite* at the level (usually) of remembering to tidy up after themselves - whoever is supervising him at the time *needs* to remind him and whoever didn't do that is also the AH, but throwing his legos out is beyond anything anyone else here has done. One time I didn't tidy my legos and my mum *pretended* to throw them out to teach me a lesson, and honestly as small as it was it was one of the most spiritually wounding events of my childhood. As soon as she saw how genuinely distraught I was she admitted the ruse. Sadly you can't admit the ruse, because you *actually* threw away something a child cares deeply about and have irreversibly damaged your and his relationship.", "ESH. You need to pay for the Lego you threw away (minus the amount you gave your parents towards your dog\u2019s treatment)\n\nYour parents should have been far more firm on getting your brother to clean up his Lego, but it\u2019s unacceptable for you to throw away (steal) your brother\u2019s things.

As someone who feels like my relationship with my brother is tenuous at best, you literally just shattered him. He is never going to trust you with his stuff and your relationship with him will probably be terrible. This is a situation that the older brother should teach his younger brother to put away his stuff, not just throw them away because of one incident. I get that you love the dog but your brother is distraught because someone he likely looked up to just took away something he enjoys.", "YTA", "YTA, good look protecting your dog from him", "NTA, your parents are. It was a very costly lesson for them to learn, let alone what your poor dog went through. Give your dog a hug for me.\n\nYes, you should have hidden them but part of me doesn't blame you. But your brother is 7, they're forgetful & won't properly understand the consequences of their actions at that age. It is & was down to your parents in this situation to police his actions. \nI suggest you go halves with your parents to replace them but on the condition that they keep them in his room. Maybe they could be in a locked box so that when he wants to play, he can be supervised.\nYou could also say that you will give them to charity if it happens again.", "Def NTA.", "NTA\n\nEven a 5 year old should understand not to leave his toys laying around. I mean even after the dog got hurt the kid didn't listen to his brother or the parents, so imo the punishment was more than fair. \n\nIt's not like an older brother who is annoyed at his brother for leaving lego in his room for his inconvenience no no it's because it has literally become a health issue for his dog, not a selfish problem but a real fucking threat.", "NTA to start. At 6, my niece is forgetful. Doesn't always remember on her own to clean up. That said, when LEGOs took me out (don't fall down stairs folks) it was enough that she's been great about cleaning them up now. Not great of course, but she'll come downstairs, see me, remember and go upstairs to clean up the LEGOs.  \n\nOPs brother's carelessness/laziness/forgetfulness or whatever you wanna call it, almost killed someone. Yes, someone was a dog but still, its  a slippery slope.  The new danger item are these god dang lite brite things niece got from her grandpa and you can bet your ass that everytime I step on one or discover the cat batting one around, I throw it away immediately.", "ESH. You can't throw away your brother's property. You are not his parent. Talk to your parents and insist that they come up with a plan to keep the dog safe. It's their job to make sure your brother doesn't leave toys in the yard, and to enforce consequences if he does it again.", "NTA your parents suck. You don't just tell a seven year old to put stuff away. You tell them, watch them and ensure they put stuff away until they are ready to do so without being told. I place the responsibility entirely on your parents. I'd have thrown the Lego away as well. Your brother isn't responsible enough to take care of it, and your parents aren't responsible enough to teach him how. Your dog doesn't deserve to die because your parents refuse to do their job. And unfortunately once the parenting failure has already been made, more drastic corrections and consequences need to be made. Way to be better at parenting than your own parents.", ">This isn't about punishing your brother; it's about protecting your dog's life after a life-threatening and expensive incident has already occurred.\n\nI think this is a valid take. The lack of action from OP's parents, even by staying silent when OP took it into his hands to give his brother a serious warning, makes me think that, even if OP had locked the LEGOs away, the parents would give it back to the brother as soon as they found out about it. The concern for the dog's life, given what had already happened, is more than enough reason for a teenager taking what some could consider \"extreme measures\".\n\nEdit: to add something that just came to me after reading the post again, since OP offered to contribute to the vet bills (and I assume his parents accepted it), I do see how OP could feel he was in a position to impose some consequences to his brother, since he had to deal with the outcome of the previous negligence (his own savings took a hit because of it).", "... my 5 year old picks up his toys.  Yes, he has to be reminded sometimes, but he has a special toy that's a foam material. He loves it,  the cat wants to eat it.  He keeps it at the top of his closet and asks me to bring it down and put it up when he's done. (He's too short to reach) He knows if he forgets, the cat will definitely chew it, and he understands that he does not want that because he loves this toy. The brother understood. He just didn't care about the consequences because he didn't expect them to be real, which leads me to believe the parents don't teach him the responsibility of picking up after himself. This is the only way to learn consequences.", "I agree with this. Was completely ready for a Y T A vote from the title and first sentence. Then when OP said the dog swallowed a piece of LEGO and the parents seem completely neutral about this issue. Action had to be taken. The chosen action may be harsh but it\u2019s a dog\u2019s life at stake.", "I agree that OP is NTA here. He made a promise and he kept it. Was it extreme? Absolutely. I think the best thing that could have been done would have been to take the legos and lock them up, the promise of return on his behavior to actually pick up his stuff.", "The question is, can you protest a dog without destoying the belongings of a child.\n\nThough that is very easy to do, I go with YTA", "Oh my god, thank you so much for this comment. My cat is currenty barely eating and not drinking, throws up as soon as she eats too much, but seems otherwise fine and healthy and I have no idea (neither does the vet) what's wrong with her. Your comment just gave me the hope that that's it!", "I mean\u2026 throwing them away was kinda stupid.  Sell them and put the money towards the vet bills\u2026", "You're literally saying a 7/yo's attachment to LEGOs are more important than a dog's life. That's what you just said. The kid deserves a lesson properly taught and not to be pampered after he almost killed OP's dog. So tired of people excusing golden child behavior just because they're under double digits. The kid is very obviously not a moron, and multiple people on here have stated that much younger than 7, their kids understand \"if I leave this out it gets torn up!\" \n\nAsking a 7/yo to pick up after himself is not a strenuous or difficult task. You're just an apologist thinking kids deserve to trample everyone else until they get to their teens then they just need to put everyone else first. Your logic makes 0 sense. The dog got hurt and the kid lost a couple tiny bricks. NOT THE SAME. The brat can deal with losing some* LEGOs. Losing a family member to an ignorant and unaccountable brat is a huge loss. LEGOs are not. I REPEAT, SINCE YOU ARE DENSE, LEGOS AREN'T A LOSS!\n\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: down to some\n\nSecond edit with what I feel is important info about me. I'm autistic.

OP needs to teach his dog to not eat random things it finds.", "It sounds like the parents would have given them back anyway.\n\nThis child needs rules about his playtime. Legos must be fully assembled to be allowed in the dog's spaces, and only disassembled in his room. No small pieces like people allowed in the dog's spaces, whether it's Lego or not.", "Lol just to clarify when I said the parents' lack of taking action I meant them not making OPs younger brother pick up his legos after playing with them both before and after OPs warning", "Your argument makes no sense. They wasted a bunch of money, his included, the fix a problem this lazy brat caused. He can't be bothered to pick up after himself, even though multiple people on here confirm long before 7 children make the mental connection to pick their things up, so you blame the older child. The older child who by the sounds of it is getting thrown under the bus for getting his brother does. Acting like the teenager who's literally getting taken advantage of is a monster for having to handle his little brother's laziness almost killing his dog! You are blaming the victim for the child being so detached he can't see how his actions are damaging. The solution is to keep the interaction from happening. Vet bills and cremation are so much more expensive than a new set of bricks for Tommy no Two Shlts to give Tyke Terror.\n\nUse logic, not favoritism for the younger kid. He gets enough of that already.", "You know what else is expensive? Canine endoscopic procedures. 7y/o can do one, he was warned before the dog had to have surgery. That alone should have been enough to scare him straight on the matter. Maybe some consequences he cares about actually will finally.", "Ah yes, because little brats like the kid should be let to kill any animals they see fit and never be punished.

You are all ridiculous and blaming OP for the fact their sibling is lazy and inconsiderate, even after having it pointed out those issues almost killed a member of their family older than him!", "Math correction. 16-7=9.", "Boo-hoo! The kid lost toys after crossing boundaries that weren't difficult to understand. acting like 7 is 3 is not going to benefit here. Little kid has reasoning skills and thinks he can get away with it bc the statement came from brother not parents. By the sounds of it they don't even punish the kid for almost killing the dog. He needed SOMETHING to show him what loss feels like. He's not special just because he's 7. He almost took a life out of negligence.", "Well, OP has no more authority to sell them than he had to throw them away. I think the immediate concern here was to prevent another incident (what if OP wasn't home to find the LEGOs and the dog ended up swallowing other pieces?), instead of covering their losses. But also, throwing it away is the kind of emotional reaction that people who are angry about a situation usually resort to, so they can feel instantly vindicated.", "Toys shouldn't be left out when you're done playing with them, regardless. Both to prevent tripping hazards, and damage to the toys.", "Let be really here. 7 y/o have an attention span barely higher than a gold fish. For this to be in anyway credible we'd need to know how and when the legos where left. Maybe he was playing with them and the parents insisted he come to dinner right away and then it was just forgotten.\n\nNot saying that's an excuse, but throwing the toys out is the equivalent of throwing the dog onto the street for pooping in the garden at night when you couldn't pick it up. You punish but not by throwing his stuff out.", "7y old could have been not with his lego's for a mutlitude of reasons: had to pee/shit, got called inside for a moment by mom or dad, etc... \n\nIt doesn't absolve OP of having to make sure his dog is in a safe area when his lazy ass throws her into the yard so he doesn't have to actually walk / play with her.\n\nLego / random shit could have been consumed in the house as well. Responsibility lies with the dog 'owner', not with the random 7y old just living and playing in their home.", "It's lazy to blame the brothers lego, where OP failed to teach their dog not to eat shit / watch what their dog does.\n\nThe brother shouldn't have to stop playing whenever op wants to release his dog in the yard", "I have no idea where I got 11 lmfaooo I\u2019m going to edit it", "What boundaries? Kid is allowed to play in the family garden. OP should have taken care of his dog properly so they don't consume random shit", "Put them in a box, don\u2019t just throw them away. Give them back after the dog is recovered rather then just get rid of something they like with no chance to get it back as a form of punishment.", "Then they should pay back OP for the vet bills. NTA OP, maybe a little bit but only because they didnt buy them. Regardless, the health of a living creature is more than legos cost.", "Agree with that and with your initial assessment he should have just hidden them.  As a parent, I\u2019d be most upset about the lost investment.  Very few open toys hold value like legos do.  So throwing away something that cost a lot and is worth a decent amount even used would piss me off\u2026", "The fact you think dogs and plastic toys from China are equivalent shows your fucked up morals.", "I absolutely think the dog needs more training! And the kid needs to learn not to leave his small toys out where they can get stepped on, mowed over, chewed up, or weathered. The thing everyone is forgetting is the kid is tearing up his own toys and everyone's okay with it. The moment OP did what he said he would do he is a monster. It is not asking too much of a 7/yo to pick up after themselves after playing.", "Also, is it not lazy to not pick up your toys after you almost killed a family member? Maybe stop thinking with hormones of thinking of this kid as a baby and use logic.", "The boundaries of \"don't leave this outside when you're done playing.\" Which should be a normal boundary to have for a 7/yo. Not that I expect anyone in here to actually study child development and know when kids are capable of these logics.", "Why does everyone else get to rage at the teen and let the child get away with anything he wants. He was given chances and refused to take care after being explained to what he did. He refused to care. You are saying Legos and a 7/yo's self centeredness are more important than a life! A few Legos and a tantrum is not as bad as almost losing s family member. We can see the kind of person you are when you act like plastic matters more than life.", "If his Legos are so expensive maybe he shouldn't leave them outside in the yard with the dog and lawn care tools. Your argument only applies if the 7/yo is a golden child. Which seems to be the case. You and everyone else are saying his abuse of the dog is sound because neither he nor his parents can be bothered to pick up his \"expensive\" toys. They obviously don't matter as much as you and everyone else is trying to claim. He leaves them outside to rot in the weather. They would've gotten torn up and lost anyway but because OP did it, after the same thing almost killed his animal, he's the problem. Man these apologists are getting ridiculous.\n\nEdit: shield to child (I really don't know what my autocorrect is on today)", "The fact that noone here seems to have an issue with one child throwing away some other child's toys is baffling to me. This wasn't the parent this wasn't someone else's toys th kids kept using. They were his. Ultimately the sibling has no right to do this. \n\nIs it a fucked up equivalency.......sure ofcourse it is. But it drives home the point. Just case he got warned doesn't make it ok. What if he was threatened with getting punched. Is it still OK then to follow on the threat. Or maybe should 16yo not hand out these threats cause they cannot react controlled to a situation like this.", "7y old could have been not with his lego's for a mutlitude of reasons: had to pee/shit, got called inside for a moment by mom or dad, etc... It doesn't absolve OP of having to make sure his dog is in a safe area when his lazy ass throws her into the yard so he doesn't have to actually walk / play with her.\n\nLego could have been consumed in the house as well. Responsibility lies with the dog 'owner', not with the random 7y old just living and playing in their home.", "The child isn\u2019t getting away with anything, I\u2019m just saying to at least give them a chance to get the toys back rather then just a \u201cone strike, your out.\u201d", "The fact that OP did it in front of their parents and didn't say anything about it isn't what alarms you? The fact that they let it continue happening after spending all that money for a dogs surgery doesn't alarm you?\n\nOP throwing out some plastic shit that can always be rebought UNLIKE A DOGS LIFE. That is not being equivalent. Don't use words you don't understand the meaning for.", "I have 2 dogs and a cat. Don't lecture Mr on the meaning of that. It does not matter if I can be rebought or not. Only 1 thing here matters. Did or didn't op throw away thing that don't bel9nh to them. They sre not the guardian of the child. The parents are. Idk what discussions the parents may or nay not have gad with the kid, neither do you. So it's not a relevant fact. Op overstep tge bounds. Take them away...sure, lock them up...sure. the second you throw them out you have crossed a line and you by default the AH.\n\nYou may not like it  but what op did borders on theft in the legal sense.", "Lecture? You are using the word as though as life and a toy have the same meaning which they do not and yes being able to repurchase something without issues does change it's equivalents. \n\nThe fact that the kid did it right after the surgery happened means the parents brushed it off or he got a small talking too that went through one ear and out the other. I don't need to know what they talked about when the actions speak for themselves.\n\nThe parents only cared when it made the youngest upset. Did they care about how their oldest felt knowing his Lil brother almost killed his dog? Not once but what could have been twice if OP hadn't picked up and thrown those Legos away?\n\nMaybe if you wanna get legal than the little brother should start doing chores to pay for the surgery or sell some of his toys. Because you know you wanna bring law into this with children \ud83d\ude44 which is utterly ridiculous btw"]}
