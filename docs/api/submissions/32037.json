But if that would've worked, they would've surely done that before your dog almost died.", "NTA. You spared yourself from a Y T A because you did give him a clear warning, in front of your parents. They had the chance to object to it, and they didn't. I remember reading that 7 is the age of reason. So more than likely would have understood that if he doesn't want his Lego thrown away, he needs to not leave them outside. And the life of the dog is more important than Lego, which is just plastic. \n\nAs some have said, it would have been better to hide them. But of course I can say that with hindsight. You get a pass for not thinking of that when the life of your dog was at the forefront of your mind.", "ESH.

Even if to say \"Now stop it, son, that's not the way to handle this\" - and THEN impose whatever consequence they deemed appropriate to your brother.\n\nYet of course their silence isn't enough to grant you parental rights. You should have picked up the LEGOs (so your dog would not swallow it again), take it straight to your parents and asked them how did they wanted to deal with this.\n\nI do have some sympathy for your situation, though, because I get the feeling that you somehow knew taking the LEGOs to your parents would amount to no real consequences for your brother.", "Your parents are TA they're lack of taking action hurt your dog and it could've happened again, YTA because you could've locked the legos up or something instead of trashing them", "NTA\nthe only thing you could\u2019ve done better is to donate them to a goodwill or something, the toys deserve a better owner", "ESH.\n\nYou have every right to protect your dog, but you just haven't thought this through.\n\nFirst, you aren't his parent. Second, he's seven. One wild threat isn't going to change his behaviour. Third, if a piece of Lego sends your dog to the hospital, what else is he eating that could send you back there? There are going to be other inedible things in your yard. You need another plan to look after him.\n\nMost importantly, you have made things worse without solving your problem. Do you really think he won't get more Lego??? You need to talk this out before it just escalates further.", "INFO- when you were 9/10 did your parents throw away any of your toys because the new baby could eat them and die or did they remind you to pick up/pick up after you if you forgot? \n\nIf they picked up after you more than a SINGLE time then major YTA.  If they employed the same draconian methods and threw out your airbuds for leaving them on the couch where baby could reach then ESH. \n\nPart of being a responsible parent- even a pet parent, since you make it clear that it\u2019s YOUR dog, is supervision. Does it suck when someone leaves something out that can hurt a loved family member, absolutely. Does it warrant destruction of property- no. The dog is your responsibility, not your brothers but you seem more interested in punishing your brother for not looking out for YOUR dog than actually protecting your dog.", "Downvote me all you want for this, but: ESH. He is a child. it's your parents' duty to do this, not yours, that'swhy they suck. But you just threw away your parents' money. Do you have any idea how expensive Lego actually is?? You could have just hidden it??

Leave the disciplining to your parents.", "YTA\n\n1. Not your place to discipline your brother. That responsibility belongs solely to your parents. If you were my kid, I would have you buying him new legos to replace what you threw away. \n2. The backyard is not a dog only area. Teach your dog to not eat random crap found on the ground.

Your parents are the assholes here for not doing anything, even when you made the threat in front of them - and also for not taking it seriously even when it was a heavy financial hit. Next time your dog might not be so lucky, as well. Lego edges and corners are extremely sharp, and if it\u2019s agony to step on one - imagine swallowing some. \n\nI, however, would not have thrown them away outright. I would have put all the pieces into a bag and put them away until such a time your brother is more responsible. He might not fully grasp the consequences just yet - based on your parents lack of action, it might not have been fully explained to your brother.\n\nDefinitely don\u2019t understand why he plays with them outside\u2026 wouldn\u2019t he lose pieces?", "YTA\n\nLet's turn it around, next time he sees your dog out and about he gets rid of it?\n\nIt's mighty irresponsible of you to let your dog play and chew on Lego.\n\nWhy is the garden 'yours' ?", "Eh NTA\n\nYour parents are bystanders, sounds like you are raising your brother too tbh.", "This is kind of a tough one.\n\nI'm gonna go with ESH.\n\nYou suck cause you threw away a child's toys. I get why you did it, and probably would have done the same thing in your shoes, but it's still kind of a shitty thing to do.\n\nYour brother sucks for not listening, but then again he's *7* and who is that responsible at that age? He's probably going to be the one to hold onto a grudge for longest.\n\nYour parents suck for being oblivious to the situation and not taking a more active role. This was an easily-avoidable situation had they been more diligent.\n\nI think you're gonna have to chalk this one up to \"a bump in the road for the family as time goes on.\" Life isn't all smooth sailing and hopefully you can all forgive each other and move on with life.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the important thing is keeping your dog from dying and keeping your family from incurring more expensive vet bills. If that means throwing out the toys that your younger brother can't be bothered to maintain, then that's what has to happen.", "YTA. \n\nYou are a sibling, not the parent. If you want your dog safe then you speak to your parents about helping your brother clean up or YOU help your brother clean up. He is 7, not 17. If I were your parent you would be replacing the Legos immediately with your earnings. The dog eating a Lego was an accident and a 7 year old should not be blamed for that. You imposed consequences on a child that you had no right to impose.", "ESH\n\nThe plural of Lego is Lego.

A 7 year old isn't *quite* at the level (usually) of remembering to tidy up after themselves - whoever is supervising him at the time *needs* to remind him and whoever didn't do that is also the AH, but throwing his legos out is beyond anything anyone else here has done. One time I didn't tidy my legos and my mum *pretended* to throw them out to teach me a lesson, and honestly as small as it was it was one of the most spiritually wounding events of my childhood. As soon as she saw how genuinely distraught I was she admitted the ruse. Sadly you can't admit the ruse, because you *actually* threw away something a child cares deeply about and have irreversibly damaged your and his relationship.", "ESH. You need to pay for the Lego you threw away (minus the amount you gave your parents towards your dog\u2019s treatment)\n\nYour parents should have been far more firm on getting your brother to clean up his Lego, but it\u2019s unacceptable for you to throw away (steal) your brother\u2019s things.

As someone who feels like my relationship with my brother is tenuous at best, you literally just shattered him. He is never going to trust you with his stuff and your relationship with him will probably be terrible. This is a situation that the older brother should teach his younger brother to put away his stuff, not just throw them away because of one incident. I get that you love the dog but your brother is distraught because someone he likely looked up to just took away something he enjoys.", "YTA", "YTA, good look protecting your dog from him", "NTA, your parents are. It was a very costly lesson for them to learn, let alone what your poor dog went through. Give your dog a hug for me.\n\nYes, you should have hidden them but part of me doesn't blame you. But your brother is 7, they're forgetful & won't properly understand the consequences of their actions at that age. It is & was down to your parents in this situation to police his actions. \nI suggest you go halves with your parents to replace them but on the condition that they keep them in his room. Maybe they could be in a locked box so that when he wants to play, he can be supervised.\nYou could also say that you will give them to charity if it happens again.", "Def NTA.", "NTA\n\nEven a 5 year old should understand not to leave his toys laying around. I mean even after the dog got hurt the kid didn't listen to his brother or the parents, so imo the punishment was more than fair. \n\nIt's not like an older brother who is annoyed at his brother for leaving lego in his room for his inconvenience no no it's because it has literally become a health issue for his dog, not a selfish problem but a real fucking threat.", "NTA to start. At 6, my niece is forgetful. Doesn't always remember on her own to clean up. That said, when LEGOs took me out (don't fall down stairs folks) it was enough that she's been great about cleaning them up now. Not great of course, but she'll come downstairs, see me, remember and go upstairs to clean up the LEGOs.  \n\nOPs brother's carelessness/laziness/forgetfulness or whatever you wanna call it, almost killed someone. Yes, someone was a dog but still, its  a slippery slope.  The new danger item are these god dang lite brite things niece got from her grandpa and you can bet your ass that everytime I step on one or discover the cat batting one around, I throw it away immediately.", "ESH. You can't throw away your brother's property. You are not his parent. Talk to your parents and insist that they come up with a plan to keep the dog safe. It's their job to make sure your brother doesn't leave toys in the yard, and to enforce consequences if he does it again.", "NTA your parents suck. You don't just tell a seven year old to put stuff away. You tell them, watch them and ensure they put stuff away until they are ready to do so without being told. I place the responsibility entirely on your parents. I'd have thrown the Lego away as well. Your brother isn't responsible enough to take care of it, and your parents aren't responsible enough to teach him how. Your dog doesn't deserve to die because your parents refuse to do their job. And unfortunately once the parenting failure has already been made, more drastic corrections and consequences need to be made. Way to be better at parenting than your own parents.", ">This isn't about punishing your brother; it's about protecting your dog's life after a life-threatening and expensive incident has already occurred.\n\nI think this is a valid take. The lack of action from OP's parents, even by staying silent when OP took it into his hands to give his brother a serious warning, makes me think that, even if OP had locked the LEGOs away, the parents would give it back to the brother as soon as they found out about it. The concern for the dog's life, given what had already happened, is more than enough reason for a teenager taking what some could consider \"extreme measures\".\n\nEdit: to add something that just came to me after reading the post again, since OP offered to contribute to the vet bills (and I assume his parents accepted it), I do see how OP could feel he was in a position to impose some consequences to his brother, since he had to deal with the outcome of the previous negligence (his own savings took a hit because of it).", "... my 5 year old picks up his toys.  Yes, he has to be reminded sometimes, but he has a special toy that's a foam material. He loves it,  the cat wants to eat it.  He keeps it at the top of his closet and asks me to bring it down and put it up when he's done. (He's too short to reach) He knows if he forgets, the cat will definitely chew it, and he understands that he does not want that because he loves this toy. The brother understood. He just didn't care about the consequences because he didn't expect them to be real, which leads me to believe the parents don't teach him the responsibility of picking up after himself. This is the only way to learn consequences.", "I agree with this. Was completely ready for a Y T A vote from the title and first sentence. Then when OP said the dog swallowed a piece of LEGO and the parents seem completely neutral about this issue. Action had to be taken. The chosen action may be harsh but it\u2019s a dog\u2019s life at stake.", "I agree that OP is NTA here. He made a promise and he kept it. Was it extreme? Absolutely. I think the best thing that could have been done would have been to take the legos and lock them up, the promise of return on his behavior to actually pick up his stuff.", "The question is, can you protest a dog without destoying the belongings of a child.\n\nThough that is very easy to do, I go with YTA", "Oh my god, thank you so much for this comment. My cat is currenty barely eating and not drinking, throws up as soon as she eats too much, but seems otherwise fine and healthy and I have no idea (neither does the vet) what's wrong with her. Your comment just gave me the hope that that's it!", "I mean\u2026 throwing them away was kinda stupid.  Sell them and put the money towards the vet bills\u2026", "You're literally saying a 7/yo's attachment to LEGOs are more important than a dog's life. That's what you just said. The kid deserves a lesson properly taught and not to be pampered after he almost killed OP's dog. So tired of people excusing golden child behavior just because they're under double digits. The kid is very obviously not a moron, and multiple people on here have stated that much younger than 7, their kids understand \"if I leave this out it gets torn up!\" \n\nAsking a 7/yo to pick up after himself is not a strenuous or difficult task. You're just an apologist thinking kids deserve to trample everyone else until they get to their teens then they just need to put everyone else first. Your logic makes 0 sense. The dog got hurt and the kid lost a couple tiny bricks. NOT THE SAME. The brat can deal with losing some* LEGOs. Losing a family member to an ignorant and unaccountable brat is a huge loss. LEGOs are not. I REPEAT, SINCE YOU ARE DENSE, LEGOS AREN'T A LOSS!\n\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: down to some\n\nSecond edit with what I feel is important info about me. I'm autistic.

Just before someone tries the \"you don't know how it is!\" I can show you all my diag paperwork with dates but it'd take too long in a reply.\n\nEdit 3 since you all think it's ok to call someone who has standards for children instead of just letting them run around without consequences disgusting. I am getting called a bunch of names and being told because I think it's disgusting to be okay with hurting animals I need to be reported. So, enjoy thinking a kid's toys are more important than an animal. You're all goofy with the logic, or rather lack thereof.", "He probably just likes playing outside", "Does it matter? If the dog was willing to eat off the ground in the backyard, it will eat it off the floor in the house. OP needs to teach his dog to not eat random things it finds.", "It sounds like the parents would have given them back anyway.\n\nThis child needs rules about his playtime. Legos must be fully assembled to be allowed in the dog's spaces, and only disassembled in his room. No small pieces like people allowed in the dog's spaces, whether it's Lego or not.", "Lol just to clarify when I said the parents' lack of taking action I meant them not making OPs younger brother pick up his legos after playing with them both before and after OPs warning", "Your argument makes no sense. They wasted a bunch of money, his included, the fix a problem this lazy brat caused. He can't be bothered to pick up after himself, even though multiple people on here confirm long before 7 children make the mental connection to pick their things up, so you blame the older child. The older child who by the sounds of it is getting thrown under the bus for getting his brother does. Acting like the teenager who's literally getting taken advantage of is a monster for having to handle his little brother's laziness almost killing his dog! You are blaming the victim for the child being so detached he can't see how his actions are damaging. The solution is to keep the interaction from happening. Vet bills and cremation are so much more expensive than a new set of bricks for Tommy no Two Shlts to give Tyke Terror.\n\nUse logic, not favoritism for the younger kid. He gets enough of that already.", "You know what else is expensive? Canine endoscopic procedures. 7y/o can do one, he was warned before the dog had to have surgery. That alone should have been enough to scare him straight on the matter. Maybe some consequences he cares about actually will finally.", "Ah yes, because little brats like the kid should be let to kill any animals they see fit and never be punished. Because Legos cost money. \n\nDo you people not hear yourselves? An animal almost lost its life and you're all complaining about PLASTIC like it's more important. Delulu", "A seven year old can be expected to understand \u201cthe dog swallowed a piece of your Lego and had to go to the vet to get it removed. From now on you need to pick up your Lego or only play with it in a place the dog can\u2019t get to it.\u201d And be held accountable if they don\u2019t do as they were asked.\n\nThough op certainly overstepped by going from zero to one hundred with making the threat in the first place.", "What if the dog eats another piece in the meantime? Or do they have to police the 7 yo every time he plays with Lego ?", "Yet the shitty ass parents didn't do their duty.\n\nIf those in charge of enforcing the rules fails or refuses to do their job, it is right and moral for the 'civilians' to take it in their own hands.", "Part of having a dog is supervising them.
