Maybe if she quit partying she'd be able to hold down a job and act like an adult and you know - pay her rent. Never allow her near your stuff again.", "NTA. She abused your trust. Go to the police about the jewelry. She brought a thief into your home.", "Nta a big time. She wrecked your house and also jewelry were missing. Get every single penny back", "She offers to watch your house. Then she destroys it\n\nNTA", "NTA. It is a total dick move to trash someone else\u2019s home. Especially given that she\u2019s 32 and not a teenager.", "Nta. Never talk to her or deal with her again. Taking the piss in a major way.", "NTA. Hope you have taken pictures. But I have a feeling she did this on purpose.", "NTA.  She said she is having financial problems and is struggling with money.  So does that mean her friends bought all of the alcohol they drank or did they help themselves to yours?", "NTA. I\u2019d press charges if possible.\n\nEdit: She probably stole your jewelry.", "NTA! I would honestly go to the police/ a lawyer so you can get every penny she owes you. Definitely take pictures of the damage if you haven\u2019t already", "NTA. I wouldn't consider a 'small gathering' to mean an event which leaves drunken people passed out on the couch and the damage you described. \n\nI hope you took photos before you started tidying up, and be sure to get photos of the damage. And consider going to the Police about your jewellery. \n\nBut out of interest, if she's struggling for money who bought wine and food? Did she buy cheap plonk, did her guests bring it with them, or did she raid your wine collection and food cupboards for her party?", "NTA\n\nYou paid her to to a job and in return she wrecks your house, breaks your rules and acts as if nothing happened. Get your money back and never give her a job again.", "NTA and I would have called the police immediately and had everyone fined for trespassing and property damage", "NTA. Take pictures of the damaged furniture and broken items to go after her for damages. Call the police about the stolen jewelry.", "NTA\n\nI was fully prepared for you to be the AH when all I had read was the title where you claimed to have overreacted, but reading this I don\u2019t consider it an overreaction.\n\n32 years old is more than old enough to be a responsible adult, and no responsible adult would hold a party IN ANOTHER PERSONS HOME where jewellery was stolen, couches stained with red wine, and animals were not treated in the agreed manner! Especially when you were paying her to house sit. \n\nJust because she thinks you have the means to replace the things she broke or her guests stole does not ever give her the right to ruin them!\n\nReport the theft for sure.", "NTA you need a police report.", "Omg NTA! I\u2019d be livid with her! And expecting her to cover costs and also report the jewellery theft to the police. She\u2019ll know who was at the house so they could investigate. Anyone who excuses her behaviour are enablers \n\nWe recently went away for 4 days with our daughters, and a friend of my eldest (both 23) house/dog sat while we were away. She\u2019d send videos and photos of the dogs, walked them, and kept the house spotless. It was such a relief to know that there was someone responsible looking after the house and pups", "NTA. \nIf she was hired by non relatives/friends, doing something like that would get her into some major trouble. (Of course she could get into trouble even with family). \n\nThe fact she didn\u2019t apologize, help clean/replace items, and still expected pay. She\u2019s out of her mind. \n\nI\u2019d press charges. Especially over the missing jewelry and damaged property.", "NTA. The sister in law is a vandal and thief. Get the police.\n\nEdit: Depending on where you are, also animal abuser.", "NTA, she's old enough to know better", "Oh so does this mean that struggling financially means you can get away with destroying other people\u2019s stuff? \nNo. The answer is no. She needs to take responsibility for the damage SHE caused and needs to replace/pay up for YOUR missing items.\nNTA.", "NTA", "Nta. Take pictures so you can forward to any family who take her side, and police for the missing items.", "NTA - she's 32, not 16, she's an adult. I hope you took pictures. The next time anyone says that you should keep the peace, show them pics of the damage", "NTA\n\nShe's 32 y/o and absolutely knew better.  Kiss any payment goodbye, change the locks, and try to not let it damage the relationship any further.", "Yeah, if I didn't get the jewelry back I'd call the police and make a report (I own no jewelry but I can't imagine having someone just go through my personal belongings and steal valuable items). And she needs to pay for the damage.", "NTA \n\nYou should have called the cops.", "NTA. In short, her response was: \u201cIt\u2019s cool, bro- you have money to buy new stuff. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d", "NTA-she is", "NTA and if she doesn\u2019t pay up take her to small claims court. She would have had to clean up before she left though. Tell the people complaining they can pay for the damages since it\u2019s not a big deal.", "NTA. I wouldn't be surprised if she's the one who stole your jewelry.", "NTA! 32??? I\u2019ve had all white decor since my 20\u2019s (which is why that part of the story makes me the angriest!) and neither myself nor my wine connoisseur friends have ruined anything. So immature!", "NTA\n\nEscalate and go to the police, honestly if you can sue her you should.", "NTA, that\u2019s deeply disrespectful, not to mention ridiculous behaviour for a 32 yo. Lesson learned I guess.", "NTA\n\nI would let her know exactly how much it was going to cost to repair/replace everything, and that if the jewelry doesn't appear in a day, that you'll be reporting it to the police as a theft.\n\nIf she's struggling financially, she shouldn't have abused your trust and your home. Then, she'd have gotten paid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

That is not to mention emotional distress in finding your pets being poorly cared for.\n\nShe screwed around, and it seems only fair that she face the consequences - she owes you for damages and losses, and if she isn't going to find out replace the jewellery then it is only fair that the appropriate legal proceedings are initiated.\nWill it completely screw with someone on minimum wage?
