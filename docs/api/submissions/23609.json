Could you try to make it a little fun and say that actually you have a little prize for anyone who does happen to wear the exact color you wear?

Go on and wear your favorite color, I can\u2019t wait to see all of you in your beautiful colors at my wedding\u201d. Maybe it\u2019ll make someone feel better, or they can show it to whoever is sowing doubt in their mind.", "NTA - Your family is too caught up on their own idea of what is appropriate that they are not able to wrap their head around the fact you simply do not care.

But really, wear whatever color you want, it doesn't matter how many people wind up wearing the same color as me. And I'm so excited that my dress is going to be a surprise to everyone!\"\n\nNTA. Anyone who is pressuring you to reveal your dress color is either terminally nosy or else is implicitly accusing you of playing mind games. Treat their rude inquiries as quaint misunderstandings (e.g. \"Oh dear, you misunderstood...I was encouraging you to wear *your* favorite color,\" or \"No, no, it's a secret from *everyone* because my dress is a secret\") and if they *continue* pressuring you, you can always remind them that they know one color you definitely aren't wearing, so if it's too stressful to pick their own dress, they should wear white.", "NAH. I don\u2019t blame you wanting to keep the color to yourself until the big day but I don\u2019t blame your family for wanting to know the color. It\u2019s common for brides to be irrational so they\u2019re probably afraid that if they show up wearing the same color as you, you\u2019ll be upset.

Even if you don\u2019t mind, as a guest, I would not want to wear the same color as you and I bet the people asking don\u2019t want to be in that position either. Again, great that you as the bride won\u2019t judge, but you can\u2019t control what your other attendees are thinking and there\u2019s a decent chance others will notice or comment if someone happens to pick your color. Just give people a break and if they ask, tell them unless you are very set on it being a secret.  You can even give a couple colors if you want it to stay a surprise.  It\u2019s a sweet thought in theory, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be having the empowering effect you were hoping for.", "NAH but leaning Y-T-A, it sounds like they want to know so they can be considerate of you during the wedding when I initially thought they were being judgemental or nosy. It's your wedding and it's great if it doesn't bother you, but I don't blame your guests for being considerate.", "Slight YTA here. You're totally within your right to wear whatever color makes you comfortable for your wedding. Your guests though have the right to not feel uncomfortable at your wedding as well. Understand that while it may not bother you, it can totally affect the mood of a wedding it it appears someone is stealing attention from the bride and groom.\n\nI'm not seeing why it is so important to not tell them what color you'll be wearing. It's not like the color is all that important compared to how the dress looks on you.", "Any chance you can give them a broad color-group? Like say it\u2019s a dark shade or light shade?", "YTA. Their stance is quite reasonable, they don't want to deal with any drama that might come from wearing the same color dress as you (even if you don't care, other relatives might give them grief over it). Besides, you can tell people without telling your fiancee. The fact that these people are actively reaching out to make sure they **don't** wear the same color dress as you suggests that they will keep the dress color a secret.", "Soft YTA.

You say you want your guests to wear a color they can feel great in, and here you are withholding information they need to select a color they'd be comfortable with.

You have explicitly said in your invites you want folks to wear whatever they're all just stuck in traditional mindsets.

I bet the photos will be fantastic!", "In my country, when newlyweds hold Western-style wedding ceremonies, some guests prefer to wear dark colors - even black or navy - as to \"highlight\" the bride. I myself went to a friend's wedding wearing a beige blouse and black office pants. I noticed that wearing black to a wedding is not a big thing in the U.S and a few other countries because they associate the color with death or funerals. If someone invited me to their wedding but specifically informed me of the preferred or taboo colors/outfits in their culture, I'd gladly oblige and find something appropriate to wear.\n\nI like the idea of having the bride and guests wearing whatever color they want, but if someone still feels uncomfortable about wearing the same color as the bride, I can understand their POVs. Perhaps you can beat around the bush a little and say, for example, tell them to \"avoid red/pink/magenta tones\", \"If you can't choose, wear (insert color)\" or \"wear anything except black\" instead of explicitly mentioning the color of your dress?\n\nNAH, both sides have their reasons.", "NTA.  I'm on my second (and hopefully last) marriage.  Both weddings I was very much the same as yourself - invited people to wear whatever they felt comfortable in.

Your guests aren\u2019t only worried about what *you* will think of them, they\u2019re worried about what *other guests* will think of them if they show up wearing the same color as the bride. You can insist it\u2019s fine until you\u2019re blue in the face (hey, there\u2019s you\u2019re Something Blue!), but it will still be considered a major faux pas, and one most people are *very* anxious to avoid.\n\nWedding traditions are bigger, older, and more powerful than any individual couple. You can break as many rules as you please, but your guests are not in your head - they are relying on rules and scripts set by *decades* of other weddings, and when they don\u2019t know what to expect, they cling to what they know even harder. And few wedding traditions are more loaded than the dress code. By insisting that white is fair game *and* being cagey about *your* dress color at the same time, you have essentially created a social minefield for your guests. \n\nI know you didn\u2019t do this maliciously, I get being uncomfortable with the whole \u201cbig white wedding\u201d thing and wanting to be Different and Unique.

The guest is silly for worrying about this.", "No idea why this take is getting downvoted, I wholeheartedly agree that this is an absolute nightmare for awkward/socially anxious guests. Anyone who accidentally ends up wearing the exact same color as the bride is going to spend the day dodging cameras and trying to disappear into the wallpaper, no matter what the bride says about it. \n\nI think it\u2019s fine to not really care about your guests\u2019 comfort if you\u2019re not having any (just elope!), but if you\u2019re going to host a party, a *little* consideration would be wise.", "I wonder if its less them being assholes and more them knowing they will be judged not by the bride but by others on the guest list who may not be familiar with OPs eccentricity.

Someone, who wasn't at the wedding and didn't see the invitation, sees a guest wearing the same color as the bride or even a white dress and decides that person needs to be called out for their behavior.  So, that busy body goes digging for the identity of the offender and then recruits others to shame the guest for wearing the same color.  This has happened before, luckily in the cases where the bride wanted people to do that they spoke up.  Problem is that the story has already been twisted to make the innocent guest look like the bad guy.\n\nSlight YTA because there is that real fear it could happen to them.  If you do post pictures on social media include a disclaimer that you specifically told guests, you didn't care what color they wore even if it was the same color as your dress.  Hopefully people will read it before going off the deep end.", "Surely everyone at the wedding has access to the same FAQ's", "No. It is the YOUNG set who has twisted themselves in knots over no champagne on moms, no light pastels for anyone and all these arbitrary rules. The OP has made it clear she a ) doesn\u2019t wish to reveal her color and b ) is fine with whatever color people decide to wear.  No person with any level of sanity is going to tut-tut that Susie wore pink when the bride didn\u2019t say she was wearing pink. \n\nAs an aside, this whole thing would make Miss Manners roll in her grave bc it\u2019s a faux pas to tell people other than the wedding party what colors to wear, and guests shouldn\u2019t have to be asking brides anything. MM would absolutely approve of how this bride is conducting herself.", "Who tf is Miss Manners?\n\nI don't see the rules that get touted on wedding shaming subs as any different than the rules my grandmas generation has internalized. Hell, except maybe that red means you fucked someone in the bridal party it is the same.\n\nBut even putting this aside, you still ignore that OP with this is setting up their guests to be judged by whichever generation is more of a pain in the ass about wedding etiquette. The bride or groom - or if you have a very active best-man and best-girl - are the ones to ask if things are unclear or you want clarification. The bride here is explicitly denying clarification. Which is her right, but still is an asshole-ish move. She could just give them like 4 colours she is not planning to wear. That would still answer the questions.", "> It is the YOUNG set who has twisted themselves in knots over no champagne on moms, no light pastels for anyone and all these arbitrary rules.\n\nYou don't seem to understand that \"champagne\" describes a range of shades, not a specific color.  The paler and light pastel shades appear ***white*** in certain lighting conditions and in photographs.  Real world example, the dress Kate Middleton wore to Harry and Megan's wedding.  The dress was a pastel yellow but, in some photographs, she looked like she was wearing white.  No bride wants a picture of a guest wearing what appears to be white and having to constantly tell people that no that person was in a light pastel dress."]}
