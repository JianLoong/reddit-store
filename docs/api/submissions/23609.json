I don\u2019t blame you wanting to keep the color to yourself until the big day but I don\u2019t blame your family for wanting to know the color. It\u2019s common for brides to be irrational so they\u2019re probably afraid that if they show up wearing the same color as you, you\u2019ll be upset.

Again, great that you as the bride won\u2019t judge, but you can\u2019t control what your other attendees are thinking and there\u2019s a decent chance others will notice or comment if someone happens to pick your color.

You say you want your guests to wear a color they can feel great in, and here you are withholding information they need to select a color they'd be comfortable with.

I bet the photos will be fantastic!", "In my country, when newlyweds hold Western-style wedding ceremonies, some guests prefer to wear dark colors - even black or navy - as to \"highlight\" the bride. I myself went to a friend's wedding wearing a beige blouse and black office pants. I noticed that wearing black to a wedding is not a big thing in the U.S and a few other countries because they associate the color with death or funerals. If someone invited me to their wedding but specifically informed me of the preferred or taboo colors/outfits in their culture, I'd gladly oblige and find something appropriate to wear.\n\nI like the idea of having the bride and guests wearing whatever color they want, but if someone still feels uncomfortable about wearing the same color as the bride, I can understand their POVs. Perhaps you can beat around the bush a little and say, for example, tell them to \"avoid red/pink/magenta tones\", \"If you can't choose, wear (insert color)\" or \"wear anything except black\" instead of explicitly mentioning the color of your dress?\n\nNAH, both sides have their reasons.", "NTA.  I'm on my second (and hopefully last) marriage.  Both weddings I was very much the same as yourself - invited people to wear whatever they felt comfortable in.

Your guests aren\u2019t only worried about what *you* will think of them, they\u2019re worried about what *other guests* will think of them if they show up wearing the same color as the bride. You can insist it\u2019s fine until you\u2019re blue in the face (hey, there\u2019s your Something Blue!), but it will still be considered a major faux pas, and one most people are *very* anxious to avoid.\n\nWedding traditions are bigger, older, and more powerful than any individual couple. You can break as many rules as you please, but your guests are not in your head - they are relying on rules and scripts set by *decades* of other weddings, and when they don\u2019t know what to expect, they cling to what they know even harder. And few wedding traditions are more loaded than the dress code. By insisting that white is fair game *and* being cagey about *your* dress color at the same time, you have essentially created a social minefield for your guests. \n\nI know you didn\u2019t do this maliciously, I get being uncomfortable with the whole \u201cbig white wedding\u201d thing and wanting to be Different and Unique.

The guest is silly for worrying about this.", "No idea why this take is getting downvoted, I wholeheartedly agree that this is an absolute nightmare for awkward/socially anxious guests. Anyone who accidentally ends up wearing the exact same color as the bride is going to spend the day dodging cameras and trying to disappear into the wallpaper, no matter what the bride says about it. \n\nI think it\u2019s fine to not really care about your guests\u2019 comfort if you\u2019re not having any (just elope!), but if you\u2019re going to host a party, a *little* consideration would be wise.", "I wonder if its less them being assholes and more them knowing they will be judged not by the bride but by others on the guest list who may not be familiar with OPs eccentricity.

So, that busy body goes digging for the identity of the offender and then recruits others to shame the guest for wearing the same color.  This has happened before, luckily in the cases where the bride wanted people to do that they spoke up.  Problem is that the story has already been twisted to make the innocent guest look like the bad guy.\n\nSlight YTA because there is that real fear it could happen to them.  If you do post pictures on social media include a disclaimer that you specifically told guests, you didn't care what color they wore even if it was the same color as your dress.

No person with any level of sanity is going to tut-tut that Susie wore pink when the bride didn\u2019t say she was wearing pink. \n\nAs an aside, this whole thing would make Miss Manners roll in her grave bc it\u2019s a faux pas to tell people other than the wedding party what colors to wear, and guests shouldn\u2019t have to be asking brides anything.

Hell, except maybe that red means you fucked someone in the bridal party it is the same.\n\nBut even putting this aside, you still ignore that OP with this is setting up their guests to be judged by whichever generation is more of a pain in the ass about wedding etiquette. The bride or groom - or if you have a very active best-man and best-girl - are the ones to ask if things are unclear or you want clarification. The bride here is explicitly denying clarification. Which is her right, but still is an asshole-ish move. She could just give them like 4 colours she is not planning to wear. That would still answer the questions.", "> It is the YOUNG set who has twisted themselves in knots over no champagne on moms, no light pastels for anyone and all these arbitrary rules.\n\nYou don't seem to understand that \"champagne\" describes a range of shades, not a specific color.  The paler and light pastel shades appear ***white*** in certain lighting conditions and in photographs.  Real world example, the dress Kate Middleton wore to Harry and Megan's wedding.  The dress was a pastel yellow but, in some photographs, she looked like she was wearing white.  No bride wants a picture of a guest wearing what appears to be white and having to constantly tell people that no that person was in a light pastel dress.", "YTA - you have people in your life who don't want to step on your toes and don't want people thinking they are being mean and wearing what the bride wore.

Some people even make the extra effort to avoid the color the wedding party will be wearing, too. Weddings are highly emotional, heavily photographed events - guests can get anxious about how they\u2019ll be perceived, just like brides do. And a smart bride (or groom) is going to want everyone\u2019s focus to be on celebrating the marriage and enjoying time with friends and family, not on who accidentally fucked up on the dress code. The fact that the bride doesn\u2019t care won\u2019t prevent *other* people from caring, and expecting every guest to have Confidence of Steel is not realistic.", "But why would someone do that? And, sorry, in this case I think it IS about the bride.", "Then just don\u2019t attend, it\u2019s a wedding, not a court date. Maybe the bride can make a rule that if you are caught judging people for their outfit colors, then you get kicked out. If you\u2019re at a wedding and you are policing what others wear beyond what even the bride would, then that\u2019s a you problem.

I just know that the generation around my grandmas age will gossip or outright complain about it and believing anything on wedding related subreddits or instagrams a chunk of mid 20 year olds will so, too.\n\nThe bride is in their right to not say their colour, but this also makes it really bad for some people attending.", "Presumably OP would not be happy if half her guest list declines the invite because she was more invested in being Quirky and Different than she was in celebrating her marriage with her loved ones.", "YTA slightly cause the fact that you specifically wrote that you won't be white. Obviously people will be curious what color you were wearing. You didn't have to go out of your way to tell people it's ok to wear white. You only had to write semi formal.", "NTA.  Invite others to wear 'their' wedding dress(es) and all can show off to each other.", "NTA\n\nYou can't win for trying. You are not being a bridezilla so some people need to create drama. I think it's lovely that you want to do some out of the box thinking. Enjoy your special day.", "Okay, what if wearing the clsame color as the brides makes them uncomfortable?\n\nJust tell them the color, its not a big deal like you said.", "NAH.  You could suggest to the more anxious guests that they could choose something with multiple colors?  Then they will be safe from not looking too similar.", "NAH... just reply that you are keeping the details as a surprise, but thanks for reaching out.", "NAH\n\nYou may not care, but the social conventions around wedding dresses are pretty ingrained into a lot of people. You will almost certainly have guests at your wedding who will be very uncomfortable if they show up and their dress is the same color as yours, even if you don't care. You're not necessarily being inconsiderate, but it will definitely be frustrating for people who prefer not to wear the same color as the bride for their own comfort.", "NTA.  You're not asking for any special requests & you don't care what color they wear.  They are just used to the traditional wedding styles & probably can't wrap their heads around what you're doing.  They don't want to be disrespectful by wearing the same color as the bride.", "NTA. But if everyone is so worried, make the dress code black and white! It would look cool in photos!", "YTA you want to buck traditions and that's fine but people do not want to end up wearing the same color as you because it would make them uncomfortable. You do not care but they do and you holding onto this secret is just making this whole process unpleasant for your guests. Decide if you care about your guests being comfortable or your fiance maybe finding out the color of your dress. \n\nTo frame it another way do your wants outweigh the wants of multiple guests. You can decide that they do but recognize that you are making others uncomfortable.", "1. She's made it very clear in the post that she IS set on it being a secret. \n2. She told everyone that she doesn't mind if they wind up wearing the same colour as her so how could they then be judged for accidentally wearing the same colour? If someone didn't get the message beforehand - this could just be explained to them on the day if they COMPLETELY UNREASONABLY get judgy with anyone.\n3. How have you managed to turn 'wear whatever you want, im totally cool with it' into her making it stressful. \n4. You're imposing tradition on a wedding that has specifically been designed not to be traditional.\n5. Its not about anyone else. NTA x1000", "I personally would feel awkward to be wearing the same colour of the bride, even if she didn't mind.", "That's why I went with NAH.", "and the important part of a wedding is for the bride to do cloak and dagger bullshit that is literally pointless. this bride is big drama.", "Does this go for any other occasion / guest of honor?", "I\u2019m starting to wonder if the people defending this choice have even *been* to a wedding, let alone been involved in planning one. \n\nThe FAQs account for exactly two opinions - the bride and groom\u2019s. They do not include (or dictate) the opinions of the rest of the guest list, many of whom are unlikely to know each other, but will have to spend hours socializing with each other, usually with the presence of alcohol *and* a photographer. The fact that the bride and groom are comfy with breaking etiquette does not mean everyone else will automatically dump their programming, particularly under the kind of scrutiny that weddings prompt. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to deal with social norms and expectations at your wedding, elopement is always an option. If you want the big, expensive party with your friends and family members, then you\u2019re going to have to brace yourself for an *onslaught* of Other People\u2019s Feelings.", "Are you asking, on *Reddit*, why someone might take pleasure in publicly embarrassing another person on the internet? \n\nYou can\u2019t be serious.", "Why would guests be pestering the bride after the fact to ascertain whether cousin Martha\u2019s dress was indeed pastel in person?  98% of the guests are not ever going to see wedding pictures after the event anyway, because they don\u2019t CARE.", "Absent some highly unusual circumstances, I\u2019m not bothering a bride who has a million things to do. I can figure out from an invite and venue what the appropriate dress code is. I am not interested in playing some silly game of oh no, what if the bridesmaids are in teal green and I show up in my little teal green dress. No one cares. It\u2019s fine.", "The fact that you don\u2019t even know who Miss Manners is/was tells me all I need to know about your age and your exposure to the finer things in life. \n\nBut let\u2019s back up. There is no rule of etiquette where it is appropriate to give your (non-wedding party) guests \u201crules\u201d about what colors to wear or avoid. You can give a dress code and at most, you can invite people to add a touch of X color if they so desire while making it clear it\u2019s not optional. This isn\u2019t a theme party. Guests are not props. You should be considerate to people\u2019s budgets and part of that is not demanding they buy new outfits if they have perfectly good ones in their closets. Indeed, that\u2019s why black tie optional evolved - technically it should be black tie or no code, but black tie optional evolved to be inclusive of younger guests who didn\u2019t have the money to buy/rent a tuxedo or gown. \n\nYou should read about wedding attire/traditions preTikTok and learn. You should maybe visit a nice hotel and look at pictures of weddings held there over the years. All other wedding traditions have evolved to be MORE inclusive. And somehow this one is now more exclusionary. It\u2019s weird.", "I personally wouldn\u2019t want those people to attend if that\u2019s how they are going to be.", "I mean, I googled her by now and she seems to be a solely american phenomenon. She seems to basically just translate the older codified british, french and german etiquettes in a way current americans could understand and how they applied to everyday lives. Since I ain't even american, the name just sounded like a pretentious influencer tbh. \n\nI have been on several weddings in my adult life and in fact will attend one again next week. I am also attending other kinds of happenings (for work and leisure) that require different kind of dresscodes, so I know what you are talking about.\n\nI am also not saying that the grandmas are correct in what they do, or that the younger ones are, too. I also don't mention tiktok, since you know, I am way too old for that, but I see it on basically every bigger or wedding related subreddits. Same as for the older generation gossiping and the younger generation complaining about some kinda colour coding. I don't like that, but I at least feel a tad of symphathy about people feeling anxious about this.\n\nTo get back to what OPs problem is: I don't see why she needs to insist that the colour is of no concern, when it obviously is of concern for the person asking. Just give like 4 colours or say that they can come naked if they feel like it.", "When it\u2019s your wedding, you\u2019re welcome to annoy as many people as you heart desires. \n\nOP may want to consider whether or not she shares that dream.", "She already said her guests can wear whatever color they like. Her guests have got to take that at face value."]}
