It's your wedding, and you can keep your dress color a surprise if you wish. Some guests may be concerned about wearing the same color, but your dress code allows them to choose freely. It's your decision, and as long as you communicate clearly, you're not inconsiderate.", "NAH. Could you try to make it a little fun and say that actually you have a little prize for anyone who does happen to wear the exact color you wear? And find a cute little something \u2014 a few stretchy bracelets (if it\u2019s a color you know is popular and is likely a few will wear) or a cute photo frame for the photo of the matching group. A bundle of flowers in that color. Whatever suits you. \n\nOr film a message, something like \u201cI, OP, really and truly want you to wear whatever color you want to my wedding. Even white. Even if it\u2019s the same color as my unconventional non-white wedding gown. Feel free to use this message as my word that there is to be NO drama and no ill will if someone should match me. Go on and wear your favorite color, I can\u2019t wait to see all of you in your beautiful colors at my wedding\u201d. Maybe it\u2019ll make someone feel better, or they can show it to whoever is sowing doubt in their mind.", "NTA - Your family is too caught up on their own idea of what is appropriate that they are not able to wrap their head around the fact you simply do not care. I love this for you. I've done the organized wedding thing. I wore white. I regret it. More power to you OP.", "\"Oh, that's so sweet. But really, wear whatever color you want, it doesn't matter how many people wind up wearing the same color as me. And I'm so excited that my dress is going to be a surprise to everyone!\"\n\nNTA. Anyone who is pressuring you to reveal your dress color is either terminally nosy or else is implicitly accusing you of playing mind games. Treat their rude inquiries as quaint misunderstandings (e.g. \"Oh dear, you misunderstood...I was encouraging you to wear *your* favorite color,\" or \"No, no, it's a secret from *everyone* because my dress is a secret\") and if they *continue* pressuring you, you can always remind them that they know one color you definitely aren't wearing, so if it's too stressful to pick their own dress, they should wear white.", "NAH. I don\u2019t blame you wanting to keep the color to yourself until the big day but I don\u2019t blame your family for wanting to know the color. It\u2019s common for brides to be irrational so they\u2019re probably afraid that if they show up wearing the same color as you, you\u2019ll be upset. Just assure them you won\u2019t do that.", "NTA.  Tell them you WILL be special.  \" I'll be the one at the front in the fancy dress next to the guy in the fancy suit. You can't  miss me.\"", "Now I really want to know the color! \ud83e\udee3 PLEASE update us after the wedding!!! And no you\u2019re not the AH do what makes you happy, it\u2019s your big day and if people keep asking just say it\u2019s a surprise you\u2019ll see on the wedding.", "NTA they\u2019re the ones being inconsiderate by starting this needless drama", "NAH but I do think you are making this more stressful for people than this needs to be. Even if you don\u2019t mind, as a guest, I would not want to wear the same color as you and I bet the people asking don\u2019t want to be in that position either. Again, great that you as the bride won\u2019t judge, but you can\u2019t control what your other attendees are thinking and there\u2019s a decent chance others will notice or comment if someone happens to pick your color. Just give people a break and if they ask, tell them unless you are very set on it being a secret.  You can even give a couple colors if you want it to stay a surprise.  It\u2019s a sweet thought in theory, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be having the empowering effect you were hoping for.", "NAH but leaning Y-T-A, it sounds like they want to know so they can be considerate of you during the wedding when I initially thought they were being judgemental or nosy. It's your wedding and it's great if it doesn't bother you, but I don't blame youe guests for being considerate.", "Slight YTA here. You're totally within your right to wear whatever color makes you comfortable for your wedding. Your guests though have the right to not feel uncomfortable at your wedding as well. Understand that while it may not bother you, it can totally affect the mood of a wedding it it appears someone is stealing attention from the bride and groom.\n\nI'm not seeing why it is so important to not tell them what color you'll be wearing. It's not like the color is all that important compared to how the dress looks on you.", "Any chance you can give them a broad color-group? Like say it\u2019s a dark shade or light shade?", "YTA. Their stance is quite reasonable, they don't want to deal with any drama that might come from wearing the same color dress as you (even if you don't care, other relatives might give them grief over it). Besides, you can tell people without telling your fiancee. The fact that these people are actively reaching out to make sure they **don't** wear the same color dress as you suggests that they will keep the dress color a secret.", "Soft YTA.  I get your reasoning, but it is inconsiderate towards your guests.  Even if you don't say anything, people will still be embarrassed if they show up wearing the same color dress as you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Here's an idea - act like you're giving in & tell everyone pressuring you \"oh, okay, my dress is a multi color floral (or lace or geometric or whatever) pattern\". That will drive them crazy or shut them up!", "NTA. Lowkey hoping you got one of those light up wedding dresses that you can cycle the colors on.", "You\u2019re doing nothing wrong, but understand that others will take this colour stuff much more seriously than you do. They will genuinely stress about it, and if they do end up wearing the same colour as you, it will impact their enjoyment of the occasion.\n\nNow, their experience is not your responsibility, but it might be easier if you did offer some guidance for people who at heart are wishing you well in this approach.\n\nNAH", "Absolutely agree with this.  OP told the guests.  Time for them to get over themselves and just go to a wedding and have fun.  Sheesh.", "It is not being considerate to insist on following a convention that she does not apply at her wedding, and that is not exactly a universal thing, either.", "Totally agree. Slight YTA. You want people to wear what they want and some people want to not be wearing the same color as the bride. You don't need to broadcast what color you're wearing but you should tell the people who have reached out to you directly.", "Why would someone assume that if they all seen on the invitation that she welcomed them to wear any color?", "just because they\u2019re reaching out doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll keep it a secret. i imagine they won\u2019t go plastering it online, but they might let it slip OP told them and then be all \u201cwell, she said not to tell anyone but it\u2019s blue!\u201d and suddenly the whole family knows", "Nta. I got married in black (albeit accidentally) without telling anyone what colour I was wearing and with a lot of goth/alternative friends, most people were wearing the same colour as me. Cute sidenote: My 16 year old daughter at the time had a boyfriend who was worried sick because he only owned one shirt and it was black. His family told him he couldn't wear black to a wedding and he couldn't afford a new shirt. Bless him.", "Mild YTA for the hypocrisy. You say you want your guests to wear a color they can feel great in, and here you are withholding information they need to select a color they'd be comfortable with. Even if you're okay with it, many people would not be okay with wearing the same color as the bride as it goes against *their* values and traditions, and you should respect that. I agree with your friends and relatives saying that you're being inconsiderate.", "NTA. It shouldn't concern them at all. They didn't buy the dress, they aren't wearing it, and it isn't their wedding day. I understand them wanting to avoid wearing your color but you specifically stated they can wear whatever color they wanted. But they need to understand you are wanting to surprise your soon-to-be husband with the color and you don't want to risk him finding out the color.", "People are very uncomfortable with change. Just smile and act dumb and repeat your requests.", "YTA but mildly.\n\nJust because it doesn't matter for you, it matters for others people. They are the ones risking ridicule by folks more set in their traditional ways. And no one will care that you opened it up if they want to run their mouth over someone. I bet some of those posts on r/weddingshaming are the results of the bride telling people they don't care what and which colour they wear.", "NTA I'm like you OP. You have explicitly said in your invites you want folks to wear whatever they're all just stuck in traditional mindsets. And may have heard horror stories like some on this sub where the bride says where whatever and then pitches a fit when everyone wears the same colour as you. But if you really don't care then just reassure them. You are not an asshole for doing your wedding your way.", "NTA and I think your wedding will be the most amazing rainbow of colours as a result! I bet the photos will be fantastic!", "In my country, when newlyweds hold Western-style wedding ceremonies, some guests prefer to wear dark colors - even black or navy - as to \"highlight\" the bride. I myself went to a friend's wedding wearing a beige blouse and black office pants. I noticed that wearing black to a wedding is not a big thing in the U.S and a few other countries because they associate the color with death or funerals. If someone invited me to their wedding but specifically informed me of the preferred or taboo colors/outfits in their culture, I'd gladly oblige and find something appropriate to wear.\n\nI like the idea of having the bride and guests wearing whatever color they want, but if someone still feels uncomfortable about wearing the same color as the bride, I can understand their POVs. Perhaps you can beat around the bush a little and say, for example, tell them to \"avoid red/pink/magenta tones\" or \"wear anything except black\" instead of explicitly mentioning the color of your dress?\n\nNAH, both sides have their reasons.", "NTA.  I'm on my second (and hopefully last) marriage.  Both weddings I was very much the same as yourself - invited people to wear whatever they felt comfortable in.  I think it worked out very nicely myself.  However, everyone else needs to stop stressing or feeling the need to put their two pennorth worth in.", "I think them telling her she is being inconsiderate pretty clearly makes them the assholes. NTA", "That's a thing?!?!????? Oh my gosh", "I would want my friends and family to take me at my word and trust that I really mean what I say. If they are truly worried (and not just being a touch hypocritical themselves) they could wear white or a pattern.", "Other people at the wedding will also know the score, though, right? Why would these hypothetical people give the other hypothetical people grief over a coincidence that everyone present will know was out of their control?", "Because that is at least indirectly setting up people to be ridiculed.\n\nEven if OP has non-traditional views, that does not mea all attendants, especially older folks will accept it. They will run their mouth over people dressing the same colour. Same as for all tose wedding or wedding attendants shaming posted on reddit. I bet at least some of them were after a bride stated something like OP.", "Its not about you or the bride. But all the others attendants that are set in their more traditional ways or online shame in case someone posts pictures."]}
