I noticed that the online ordering system had a glitch.  One item instead of being $21.99 was priced at -$3.50.  \n\nSo as a joke I ordered my food, her food, and two orders of the mispriced item.  I figured the system would catch the mistake and I would take those items off my order before I paid for the purchase.  \n\nThe bill was not $80+ like I expected.  It was about $35.  So I added a 10% tip for pickup and off I go.  I thought worst case scenario I have lunches for a couple of days.  I'm not going to lie, I thought about ordering enough of that entree to make my bill $0. I didn't. \n\nSince it was all online the restaurant didn't even process the purchase. I walked in got my food and walked out.  \n\nMy wife was waiting when I got home with our food and she asked about the extra food.  I showed her the bill and explained that not only was it free it actually subsidized our dinner.  \n\nShe got upset with me for \"stealing\" from her favorite restaurant.  She said I probably got someone in trouble. She wanted me to drive back to the restaurant and pay them back the extra money.  I refused.  \n\nSo we have been arguing for a couple of days now.  I feel kind of bad for doing something that started a fight on Valentine's Day.\n\nOne last thing.  This is a massive chain restaurant. It's not like one mom and pop Italian restaurant is going to go out of business.  Think like Chili's. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676641067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114khq5/aita_for_taking_advantage_of_a_glitch_on_a/", "score": 682, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Taking something from someone else without compensation or consent is wrong, ok, you didn't do that.  You purchased an item for the listed price, full stop.

I noticed that the online ordering system had a glitch.  One item instead of being $21.99 was priced at -$3.50.  \n\nSo as a joke I ordered my food, her food, and two orders of the mispriced item.  I figured the system would catch the mistake and I would take those items off my order before I paid for the purchase.  \n\nThe bill was not $80+ like I expected.  It was about $35.  So I added a 10% tip for pickup and off I go.  I thought worst case scenario I have lunches for a couple of days.  I'm not going to lie, I thought about ordering enough of that entree to make my bill $0. I didn't. \n\nSince it was all online the restaurant didn't even process the purchase. I walked in got my food and walked out.  \n\nMy wife was waiting when I got home with our food and she asked about the extra food.  I showed her the bill and explained that not only was it free it actually subsidized our dinner.  \n\nShe got upset with me for \"stealing\" from her favorite restaurant.  She said I probably got someone in trouble. She wanted me to drive back to the restaurant and pay them back the extra money.  I refused.  \n\nSo we have been arguing for a couple of days now.  I feel kind of bad for doing something that started a fight on Valentine's Day.\n\nOne last thing.  This is a massive chain restaurant. It's not like one mom and pop Italian restaurant is going to go out of business.  Think like Chili's. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's assuming that an order is coming through every 5 minutes the entire time a person is there. That's not how it works, and obviously you don't know when orders will come in, but you still want someone staffing that area. Usually the first and last hour or two is pretty slow, and they don't staff people full 8 hour shifts. \n\nSo, as an example,  if they assign a server to to-go they'll have them work something like 4PM to 9PM. From 4-6 they'll make like $10 bucks before taxes. And from 9-10 they'll make about the same. 6-8 will be their busy hours, and then they'll probably make like $50-$70, so for a total of ~$70-$90. If you do hourly it would be like $13 an hour, but since it's not like they can work longer hours (the restaurant won't let them), you really should treat it as the equivalent to an 8 hour shift. \n\nAnd that fluctuates, some nights more, some a lot less. That of course can change a lot based on the location. Some pay to-go people minimum wage and they don't expect anything more than the occasional tip. Sometimes they just have servers do it between their tables. It really varies, but generally speaking that's roughly how it works.", "That's just the way things work. You don't legally have to tip, just like you don't legally have to be nice to a cashier. You *can* curse at a teenager working at the grocery store( used to happen to me all the time), but it's a dick move. \n\nNo one is forcing people in America to go to restaurants, you're free to not.

NTA for any of the situation.", "It depends on the restaurant. If it\u2019s a restaurant I go to frequently I tip at least 20% if it\u2019s a restaurant that I don\u2019t go to that often at least 15% if it\u2019s one of the restaurants where have a vacation house I tip even more because the area is poor and the people \nDefinitely need the money in one restaurant that I go to is very affordable and on sit down meals I give them 50%", "But that's not our problem they don't get paid a decent wage.

Idk how it works in all restaurants, but if a server has to be available to pack orders, they may be missing out on tips from tables. So even though it only takes a few minutes to pack a bag, they are losing wages if they don\u2019t get tips from the pick-up customers. I\u2019m sure the policy and base pay vary by location. The restaurant should pay their employees themselves but that\u2019s not how it always works in the US. \n\nI had a pizza delivery driver thank me for my tip the other day. She said she recently switched from a franchise location to a corporate location. (Same chain, but different owners.) She said the franchise owners used to split the delivery fee with the drivers, but the corporate owners don\u2019t. The website tells customers drivers don\u2019t get the fee, but a lot of them still think the driver does, so they don\u2019t tip."]}
