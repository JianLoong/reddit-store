{"id": 1910, "submission_id": "yqo5p7", "title": "AITA for deciding to call my dads fianc\u00e9e mom and calling my actual mom by her name now?", "selftext": "Context: I\u2019m (20F) not too close with any of my parents. My dad (42M) signed away his parental rights when I was two and I don\u2019t meet him until I was 13. My mom (42F) although a great mother to my siblings was absolutely vile towards me and kicked me out at 14 which had me fending for myself. I\u2019m now all grown up with my own place, putting myself through school and working full time. I limit contact with all my parental figures (stepdad, mom, dad, his fianc\u00e9e).\n\nOn to the story. My dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9 who we will call Patty (40F) proposed to him earlier this year and they are tying the knot next year! She asked for my blessing and help to plan the proposal. She also asked me to be her bridesmaid, which I accepted. \n\nPatty is lovely. She calls me at least once a week and we catch up and she always plans visits to see me. I adore her. Patty and my dad have 3 kids together and she has two kids from a previous relationship. I live about a 3 hour drive from them and don\u2019t drive, but Patty always calls me when they have family outings and events, she\u2019ll arrange a ride for me. Patty has never tried to weasel in and act like my mom or hold a parental role in my life. However she\u2019s always made me feel like a daughter. \n\nI\u2019ve never questioned the love and respect Patty has for me. She tells me she loves me and how I\u2019m the daughter she never got to have. Patty is a cancer survivor and at the very worst she asked to see me more. We bonded a lot during that time. I opened up a lot to her and still she respected my boundaries around parenting. She just offered her ear, her shoulder to cry on and nothing but love.\n\nMy mom on the other hand only calls me for money and gifts. She never thanks me and still compares me to my older brother who lives at home, doesn\u2019t work, and doesn\u2019t go to school. I try my best to keep some relationship with her. She\u2019s been through a lot and I believe she can get better. I love her after all but it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019s never been a mom to me.\n\nNow I don\u2019t want any legal adoption but I wanted to show Patty that I do see her as a mom now. My plan is to draft up a fake adoption certificate and get her an engraved locket with a picture of all her kids in it. I also want to stop calling her Patty and call her \u2018mom\u2019. \n\nI told my dad about this and he was ecstatic. My mom on the other hand says it\u2019s disrespectful to her. I just can\u2019t see that argument as I call my step dad \u2018dad\u2019. My mom said it\u2019s different because he\u2019s been in my life longer and that my \u201csperm donors new wh*** shouldn\u2019t share the same label\u201d as her. Ensue lots of arguing and me cutting my visit with her short.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole. I sent my mom a long message. Gist being \u201csince you gave up being a mom to me when I was 14, and don\u2019t want to share the mom label I will no longer be addressing you as mom have a good day Helen\u201d\n\nMy older brother thinks I\u2019m an asshole and that I\u2019m doing this to be vindictive and to spite my mom. I think if you want to play stupid games you get to win the stupid prize.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I want to say the situations with my bio parents is very complicated and a lot more nuanced then I depicted in my original post. I didn\u2019t feel like divulging all the details but since it seems to come up often I want to make some things clear.\n\nMy bio dad and mom were too young when they had my brother and I. Both come from traumatic backgrounds. My bio mom got stuck with the short end of the stick. She was stuck with both of us but met my step dad shortly after. I want to make it clear that my bio mom is not a terrible mom. She is amazing to my siblings and I always tell her how proud of how far she\u2019s come. She was just vile towards me. \n\nNeither of my bio parents have been great parents. I don\u2019t hold that against them. \n\nAll I\u2019ve ever wanted from my bio parents is an apology. For them to accept and take responsibility for the hurt they\u2019ve caused. My bio dad has. He spent years being called every name in the book besides dad up until I was 19. He had to earn my trust and place in my life as dad. Even until this day I consider him as my \u201cimproving dad\u201d while my step dad is \u201cgood dad.\u201d\n\nTo paint a better picture of my mother, she almost killed me on multiple occasions. She would beat me until I passed out then beat me until I regained consciousness only to say she hoped I died so she\u2019ll no longer be reminded of how I ruined her life. She made me start paying for rent at 12 and when I couldn\u2019t she withheld food. When social workers got involved she said if I didn\u2019t lie about how I got my black eyes or bruises she said she would kill me before they could take me away and she\u2019ll gladly go to jail because she would be satisfied I was out of this world. And tons more. Not to mention when I was suicidal and depressed around 10 (hospitalized after many attempts) when I got home on my 12th birthday she said \u201cyou can\u2019t even kill yourself right huh? We didn\u2019t get you anything because if you don\u2019t value your life why the F*** should we?\u201d\n\nThe thing is I never held resentment towards her. I love her. I understand my dad hurt her. I understand she was around my age, stuck with two kids and her still developing mind linked my bio dad leaving to my birth since he left shortly after I was born. \n\nALL IVE EVER WANTED was for her to say sorry. Was for her to say she was proud of me or that she loved me. All I\u2019ve ever wanted was for her to acknowledge the hurt she\u2019s caused or even say the words \u201cI love you.\u201d That\u2019s all. My parents lives were far from easy but I think the first step to growth is acknowledging that sometimes you are the villain in someone\u2019s else\u2019s story. That we all have faults and short comings but to accept and try to make amends for those. And to grow when given the chance. \n\nMy mother\u2019s consistent lack of accountability has lead me to feel this way. I told her that if and when she is ready to form a relationship with me she has to know my bio dad and his partner and the relationship I\u2019ve cultivated with both are non negotiable, and that if she can\u2019t then she will no longer share the \u201cmom\u201d label as I just won\u2019t call her mom from this moment forward. \n\nI love my family, both by blood and my found/chosen family. I will never (no matter how much of an injustice to myself it may seem) fully cut my mother off. She needs time to heal. She needs time to work on herself and even if it takes until she\u2019s on her death bed for her to say \u201cI love you\u201d to me I will hold on to that hope.\n\nJust because she can\u2019t love me unconditionally or because I won\u2019t call her \u2018mom\u2019 anymore does not mean I don\u2019t love her unconditionally. I just want to instil boundaries so that I no longer feel like a doormat.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit more. And explains how I\u2019ve reacted and accepted a lot of things. I know it\u2019s not entirely healthy but I love her and I always will. Even if I have to do it distantly.", "created_utc": 1668012096, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqo5p7/aita_for_deciding_to_call_my_dads_fianc\u00e9e_mom_and/", "score": 340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
