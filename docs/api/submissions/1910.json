My dad (42M) signed away his parental rights when I was two and I don\u2019t meet him until I was 13. My mom (42F) although a great mother to my siblings was absolutely vile towards me and kicked me out at 14 which had me fending for myself. I\u2019m now all grown up with my own place, putting myself through school and working full time. I limit contact with all my parental figures (stepdad, mom, dad, his fianc\u00e9e).\n\nOn to the story. My dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9 who we will call Patty (40F) proposed to him earlier this year and they are tying the knot next year! She asked for my blessing and help to plan the proposal. She also asked me to be her bridesmaid, which I accepted. \n\nPatty is lovely. She calls me at least once a week and we catch up and she always plans visits to see me. I adore her. Patty and my dad have 3 kids together and she has two kids from a previous relationship. I live about a 3 hour drive from them and don\u2019t drive, but Patty always calls me when they have family outings and events, she\u2019ll arrange a ride for me. Patty has never tried to weasel in and act like my mom or hold a parental role in my life. However she\u2019s always made me feel like a daughter. \n\nI\u2019ve never questioned the love and respect Patty has for me. She tells me she loves me and how I\u2019m the daughter she never got to have. Patty is a cancer survivor and at the very worst she asked to see me more. We bonded a lot during that time. I opened up a lot to her and still she respected my boundaries around parenting. She just offered her ear, her shoulder to cry on and nothing but love.\n\nMy mom on the other hand only calls me for money and gifts. She never thanks me and still compares me to my older brother who lives at home, doesn\u2019t work, and doesn\u2019t go to school. I try my best to keep some relationship with her. She\u2019s been through a lot and I believe she can get better. I love her after all but it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019s never been a mom to me.\n\nNow I don\u2019t want any legal adoption but I wanted to show Patty that I do see her as a mom now. My plan is to draft up a fake adoption certificate and get her an engraved locket with a picture of all her kids in it. I also want to stop calling her Patty and call her \u2018mom\u2019. \n\nI told my dad about this and he was ecstatic. My mom on the other hand says it\u2019s disrespectful to her. I just can\u2019t see that argument as I call my step dad \u2018dad\u2019. My mom said it\u2019s different because he\u2019s been in my life longer and that my \u201csperm donors new wh*** shouldn\u2019t share the same label\u201d as her. Ensue lots of arguing and me cutting my visit with her short.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole. I sent my mom a long message. Gist being \u201csince you gave up being a mom to me when I was 14, and don\u2019t want to share the mom label I will no longer be addressing you as mom have a good day Helen\u201d\n\nMy older brother thinks I\u2019m an asshole and that I\u2019m doing this to be vindictive and to spite my mom.

Your biological mother will just have to deal", "NTA.  For all intents and purposes, Patty IS your mom.  Helen is just a woman whose womb you hung out in for 9 months.\n\nFWIW, I know someone in a similar position who calls her stepdad \"Dad/Daddy\" and her estranged father the more distant-sounding \"Father.\"  It's just so formal and clunky that it gets her point across the few times she has to deal with him.", "NTA, you are following your heart. Being a mom is more than giving birth. Your bio mom kicked you out at 14 (insert expletive)! Patty may not have given birth to you, but her love is precious and by calling her mom you honor her greatly. I'm sure she will love you all the more for it.", "Definitely NTA. I think parents forget that unconditional love is not when they feel like it.

You are an asshole to yourself though. Why on Earth would you keep a parental figure in your life who literally kicked you out of home at 14?  Why didn't your dad take you in, since they knew you when you were 13? Why do you have relationships with either of your parents when they both abandoned you and literally left you as a child to fend for yourself? This is all so weird to me", "I'm happy to hear that you finally got the mother you deserve. NTA for sure. Helen can cry all she wants, she is not important anymore.", "Patty sounds pretty great and that sounds like a sweet thing to do for her (and for yourself). Call her mom if she's okay with it.

You really should go NC with Helen.   \"and I believe she can get better\" is never going to happen.  Give up all hope for a better Helen."]}
