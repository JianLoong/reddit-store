Treating someone with this kind of disrespect (or any) when they have offered you a place to live when you\u2019re dealing with hardships is absolutely unacceptable", "NTA, you opened up your home, basically treated them as family just for them to be ungrateful and spiteful. You did what was right.", "NTA . You were more than generous and kind to these people and they \u201cmistreated\u201d you. Talk about ungrateful and entitled. Of course they should have been shown the door.", "Nta but you have to know you weren\u2019t. I would be blunt, \u201cwe opened our home to them with no time limit or payment required. Do you honestly believe what that are saying?\u201d And let the other party take the conversation further. Either it is a gossip looking for fuel, or someone who knows you well enough to be aware it is a false story.

It also seems like they are jealous of the things that you have worked for all of your lives.\n\nNone of your true friends will believe their ridiculous accusations.  You were incredibly kind to these people, and this is their thanks. \n\nI don't think that you are obligated to discuss this with anyone unless you want to and think that the discussion will be productive.\n\nThey have probably treated others miserably in the past - such behavior is not likely to be a one time thing.  I suspect that this will blow over quickly if no one feeds the drama.\n\nNTA", "Let me simplify it for you.
