It also seems like they are jealous of the things that you have worked for all of your lives.\n\nNone of your true friends will believe their ridiculous accusations.  You were incredibly kind to these people, and this is their thanks. \n\nI don't think that you are obligated to discuss this with anyone unless you want to and think that the discussion will be productive.\n\nThey have probably treated others miserably in the past - such behavior is not likely to be a one time thing.

So if you purchase a BMW for your own child or grandchild you should get one for them too so they don't feel \"less\"? Please...... I will never understand these kind of people, instead of being grateful for the help you provided they went behind your back. Their child's birthday is NOT your responsibility.", "NTA. \u201cNo good deed goes unpunished.\u201d\n\nTake it as a learning experience and never do that again.", "NTA.\n\nThis is why people can't do good things. And why I would be cautious of doing such a thing (not that I'm in such a position).\n\nAnd I would disagree on kicking them out for the initial comments. But for them to spread that about \"being mistreated,\" or treated like they're less than. It is not your responsibility to throw their child a party.\n\nIt seems like jealously, but yeah....Just cut those people as fast as you can. If there are people not willing to hear you out, then it was good that this event exposed those people.\n\n...\n\nMy family speaks behind each other's backs and I hate it, you can't expect people not to. But you can have standards, and if they're not family; it's much easier.", "NTA. You provided them with housing and they expected birthday parties?

I would call the police, and let that also show their audience of believers whom to trust when it comes to talking you down.", "So you have no backbone at all?

You did kick them out for making a comment you did not like.", "Those who are disappointed reply with \"I shall advise the family you are able to house them. Thanks for showing us how to do it.\" I bet they back down with the jugding. You are NTA. They sounded like relative strangers who you did a nice thing for.

Good thing they moved out immediately. Call the police about your stolen stuff. Who cares what others think. Stop being a doormat.", "NTA you shouldn't have let these strangers into your home in the first place. Sound like total losers", "The problem with people pleasing is that it usually ends with you laying face down as people walk all over you. If you give and give, someone will keep taking until you have nothing left.

They were having to cover things I let drop by burning out, they lost time with me and they had to worry watching me hurt myself. \n\nI felt like people pleasing was choosing others over myself. Actually, it was choosing random people over those I loved most.", "NTA. Call the police and report the thieves.", "That's why you need to report the theft or they'll do it to the next sob that takes them in", "Talk about no good deed going unpunished.\n\nMake a police report for the thefts.\n\nKeep being kind - not everyone is an ingrate to those who help them. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n>we\u2019ve had several people contact us and say how disappointed they were \n\n Tell them to take them in.", "NTA   you just came across a dog of a family..  notch it up to experience and move forward...", "Are you serious? They lived in op's house for free for months and they dare to speak like this about op's niece/nephew?? \n\n They're lucky op gave them 2-3 months to arrange sonething else. I would've thrown them out right away.", "Getting YOUR things back from them that they STOLE isn't petty. I don't even see how that would make you look petty. Them waiting until you all leave the house to pack up all their things and decide they \"deserve\" to have your things more than you do and slinking away before you got back and caught them was slightly petty on their part. \n\nHave you even said anything to them about the things they took and getting anything back?", "Petty for your own belongings? These are not good people. I wills give them one chance to return the missing items and then call the police. I might give a pass for shampoo or food or a pillow but if they took electronics or a gaming  system, that is not a necessity.", "It's not always about lacking \"backbone\". Sometimes you weigh up effort vs reward, decide a conflict isn't worth the hassle, and let it go. Like, if someone stole my laptop, I would fight to get it back; if they stole a magazine or something, whatever."]}
