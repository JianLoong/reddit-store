So between now and the end of August, Aiden only goes to his mom\u2019s house every other weekend since Lillie is working 16-hour days.\n\nBecause Aiden was born right before quarantine, our Dad allowed Calvin to move back in with him rent-free, only asking for a little bit of help around the house, so Calvin wouldn\u2019t have to work in-person and possibly risk his or Aiden\u2019s health. Calvin took complete advantage of our Dad\u2019s kindness. He constantly partied, wouldn\u2019t contribute around the house, and lied about why he \u201cneeded\u201d Dad to watch Aiden.\n\nDad has tried reasoning with Calvin for years, but Calvin has just blown him off and Dad\u2019s had enough. He stood up to Calvin and said he is done with Calvin taking advantage of his kindness, and that it isn\u2019t fair to him to be treated as a private daycare for Aiden while Calvin\u2019s out drinking like a frat boy. He gave Calvin four months to figure out actual childcare or work out a new custody arrangement with Lillie and then move out.\n\nWe are now two weeks away from the move-out date that our Dad gave Calvin. Calvin was seemingly just hoping for Dad to give up and resume their current living/childcare situation. Calvin is only accepting now that our Dad is serious and isn\u2019t going to back down on this. Our local housing market is awful (think SoCal levels of crazy expensive.) Calvin came to me asking to move in with me.\n\nI made it very clear that if Calvin does move in, he is paying rent on-time with no exceptions. And I am not going to provide childcare for Aiden.

If he tries to dump Aiden on me, I will report Aiden to CPS as abandoned so that they can contact Lillie to come and pick Aiden up.\n\nCalvin is begging for a discount because he says the rent I am asking (Exactly half of what the mortgage costs me every month) is too high and he would have to get a part-time retail job. Calvin and his high school friends were not very nice to certain people. He\u2019s afraid of someone recognizing him and the possibility of being seen as a cliche person who peaked in high school. I told Calvin I don\u2019t care. Swallow your pride, suck it up, and grow up. I\u2019m already offering a fair rent, and I won\u2019t have him taking advantage of me the way he did with Dad.\n\nOthers have called me out and accused me of \u201ccoldly and selfishly taking advantage\u201d of Calvin and treating him \u201clike a stranger.\u201d I told these people that if they\u2019re so concerned, they can help house Calvin and provide him with childcare.

Thinking a few new \"rules\" and a lease is going to change anything is laughable.\n\nHe is an *intentionally* unemployed, irresponsible partier, with self-admitted bully partier friends. She can ban them, but he has no respect for her, so he will invite them when she isn't there, and he will not respect her belongings or peace.

Believe him the first time, and read up on how hard it is to evict people. It's a nightmare and extremely expensive, even in the very rare cases where ungrateful, disrespectful guests somehow *don't* damage the home or room. I know all this because I've seen it happen to a lot of folks who just wanted to help family or friends who are irresponsible and entitled, and they ended up in a nightmare.\n\nIf he was just a decent, helpful, respectful person to your dad while he helped him, he wouldn't even need your help.

Also, while you are 100% not obligated in any way to do this, it Lillie does get custody, maybe she and your father could figure out a situation where he's compensated to do some planned babysitting, cuz it would be good for Aiden to continue to spend time at your father's house which is comfortable and familiar to him.", "YTA (to yourself) for being stupid and agreeing to let him move in at all.

That\u2019s because Calvin got himself into a tight spot, and instead of using the time and help from your dad to get his life together, he *deliberately fucked up his life more*, in the hope that this would sway your dad to let him off the hook.\n\nWhich, for quite some time, it did.\n\nHonestly? I think the wisest and fairest move is to tell Calvin that his whining and excuse-making no longer make renting to him look like a reasonable option, and you wish him the best in finding a lower-cost location in which to grift his way through life. \n\nBut if you aren\u2019t going to do that\u2014and I can understand that it would be harder with Aiden in the picture\u2014get everything in writing.

I don\u2019t think there is a lease iron-clad enough to make this work out for you.
