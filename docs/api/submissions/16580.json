So between now and the end of August, Aiden only goes to his mom\u2019s house every other weekend since Lillie is working 16-hour days.\n\nBecause Aiden was born right before quarantine, our Dad allowed Calvin to move back in with him rent-free, only asking for a little bit of help around the house, so Calvin wouldn\u2019t have to work in-person and possibly risk his or Aiden\u2019s health. Calvin took complete advantage of our Dad\u2019s kindness. He constantly partied, wouldn\u2019t contribute around the house, and lied about why he \u201cneeded\u201d Dad to watch Aiden.\n\nDad has tried reasoning with Calvin for years, but Calvin has just blown him off and Dad\u2019s had enough. He stood up to Calvin and said he is done with Calvin taking advantage of his kindness, and that it isn\u2019t fair to him to be treated as a private daycare for Aiden while Calvin\u2019s out drinking like a frat boy. He gave Calvin four months to figure out actual childcare or work out a new custody arrangement with Lillie and then move out.\n\nWe are now two weeks away from the move-out date that our Dad gave Calvin. Calvin was seemingly just hoping for Dad to give up and resume their current living/childcare situation. Calvin is only accepting now that our Dad is serious and isn\u2019t going to back down on this. Our local housing market is awful (think SoCal levels of crazy expensive.) Calvin came to me asking to move in with me.\n\nI made it very clear that if Calvin does move in, he is paying rent on-time with no exceptions. And I am not going to provide childcare for Aiden.

If he tries to dump Aiden on me, I will report Aiden to CPS as abandoned so that they can contact Lillie to come and pick Aiden up.\n\nCalvin is begging for a discount because he says the rent I am asking (Exactly half of what the mortgage costs me every month) is too high and he would have to get a part-time retail job. Calvin and his high school friends were not very nice to certain people. He\u2019s afraid of someone recognizing him and the possibility of being seen as a cliche person who peaked in high school. I told Calvin I don\u2019t care. Swallow your pride, suck it up, and grow up. I\u2019m already offering a fair rent, and I won\u2019t have him taking advantage of me the way he did with Dad.\n\nOthers have called me out and accused me of \u201ccoldly and selfishly taking advantage\u201d of Calvin and treating him \u201clike a stranger.\u201d I told these people that if they\u2019re so concerned, they can help house Calvin and provide him with childcare.

Nope.  Just nope all over the place.", "Final sentence got me. You're a woman and these people expect you to be his (both brother's and nephew's) mommy, maid and babysitter.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "I agree about not letting him move in.  Please don\u2019t do it, it won\u2019t go well.", "For those who have the bad manners to comment on your family\u2019s business, you can always ask them why they feel free to cross that boundary. It\u2019s rude AF for them to comment in any way, much less critically. It\u2019s an important lesson for you. If you can\u2019t shut down those people, how will you manage Calvin\u2019s boundary breaking?  It\u2019s important you learn not to succumb to manipulation.", "NTA , but you\u2019d be the AH to yourself if you let him move in.  It\u2019s not going to end well for you.    Does he not work at all?", "Nta I\u2019ve had a three friends who married and divorced the party boy dad. They never quit drinking. Don\u2019t let him move in.", "You allowing him to move in with a kid is a kindness. What more are they asking you do to? You are offering him a place to live in a place that that he would otherwise not be able to afford. \n\nIs requiring someone to pay rent on time cruel now? Letting a parent know that you will not be a free babysitter so they can screw around instead of raising their own child taking advantage of them?\n\nYou don't have to let them move in at all. If your brother can't pay his bills, then he needs to change his life. And if his biggest concern is being seen as someone who peaked in high school, he REALLY needs to change his life. \n\nNTA", "Nta \n\nEven if he didn't want to work retail, nearly anyone with a pulse and a willingness to actually work can get into construction/roadwork/warehouse jobs. He doesn't just want to not work retail, he just doesn't want to work period.", "NTA\n\nYour brother has made this bed for himself, and will most likely try to use you as he did your father.\nPeople like him need to be handled \"harshly\" because otherwise they will test the limits and \"pull the leash\" as much as possible.\nIf you do let him move in with you, make sure to write up a contract and have him sign it.\nFamily doesn't give you a pass for everything.", "Yo what the fuck is up with lack if tldrs lately?", "NTA. Do NOT let him move in. It's not going to end well. You'll have to evict him and people will say even more hateful things to you. \n\n\nI'm going to assume that the person who have called you cold and selfish has offered to let Calvin move in rent free with them. (/s)", "NTA.   If you did not set those rules, you know you would be taken advantage of. \n\nI will say that charging half of your mortgage might be steep.  You are getting equity in the house and a renter is not. While the owner has additional costs,  the building is yours.  \n\nI know some landlords do it that way, though so it is your call.  Your brother's concern that taking a second job will make him look like a loser is his problem.", "NTA. Does Lilie knows how irresponsible Calvin is with their son? I wonder if Lillie could fight for full custody. I hope your brother doesn\u2019t blame Aiden because he sounds immature.", "So you all are just throwing Aiden's son out on the street? You're all the assholes.", "This kid should be living with his mom who has a steady home and a steady job\u2026even with the 16 hr days she can probably get a nanny..kid shouldn\u2019t have to risk homelessness etc just because his dad\u2019s an idiot", "Definitely get a lease. You probably will have trouble getting him to pay, but with a lease it will be easier to evict him when that happens.\n\nAlso;\n\n>the possibility of being seen as a cliche person who peaked in high school\n\nIt sure sounds like he did peak in high school.", "NTA. Also, I\u2019m an attorney and absolutely agree that he will not pay rent. I\u2019m kind of amazed he\u2019s even complaining about the amount because he knows he\u2019s not going to pay it. Once he gets in your house, he\u2019ll act just like he did at your dad\u2019s.  You won\u2019t get rent and you\u2019ll incur extra expenses trying to get him evicted", "This OP.\n\nNTA. He won\u2019t pay rent. He won\u2019t get a job. He will dump his kid on you every chance he gets.\n\nHe\u2019s shown all of y\u2019all who he is - you need to believe that this IS the person you will have living with you.\n\nAs for the person saying they\u2019re disappointed in you ask them what day you should tell Calvin and kid they can move in. They probably have plenty of room for Calvin up on that high horse they\u2019re sitting on.", "And you will be doing 100% of the housework and caring for his son.", "Exactly this."]}
