So between now and the end of August, Aiden only goes to his mom\u2019s house every other weekend since Lillie is working 16-hour days.\n\nBecause Aiden was born right before quarantine, our Dad allowed Calvin to move back in with him rent-free, only asking for a little bit of help around the house, so Calvin wouldn\u2019t have to work in-person and possibly risk his or Aiden\u2019s health. Calvin took complete advantage of our Dad\u2019s kindness. He constantly partied, wouldn\u2019t contribute around the house, and lied about why he \u201cneeded\u201d Dad to watch Aiden.\n\nDad has tried reasoning with Calvin for years, but Calvin has just blown him off and Dad\u2019s had enough. He stood up to Calvin and said he is done with Calvin taking advantage of his kindness, and that it isn\u2019t fair to him to be treated as a private daycare for Aiden while Calvin\u2019s out drinking like a frat boy. He gave Calvin four months to figure out actual childcare or work out a new custody arrangement with Lillie and then move out.\n\nWe are now two weeks away from the move-out date that our Dad gave Calvin. Calvin was seemingly just hoping for Dad to give up and resume their current living/childcare situation. Calvin is only accepting now that our Dad is serious and isn\u2019t going to back down on this. Our local housing market is awful (think SoCal levels of crazy expensive.) Calvin came to me asking to move in with me.\n\nI made it very clear that if Calvin does move in, he is paying rent on-time with no exceptions. And I am not going to provide childcare for Aiden.

If he tries to dump Aiden on me, I will report Aiden to CPS as abandoned so that they can contact Lillie to come and pick Aiden up.\n\nCalvin is begging for a discount because he says the rent I am asking (Exactly half of what the mortgage costs me every month) is too high and he would have to get a part-time retail job. Calvin and his high school friends were not very nice to certain people. He\u2019s afraid of someone recognizing him and the possibility of being seen as a cliche person who peaked in high school. I told Calvin I don\u2019t care. Swallow your pride, suck it up, and grow up. I\u2019m already offering a fair rent, and I won\u2019t have him taking advantage of me the way he did with Dad.\n\nOthers have called me out and accused me of \u201ccoldly and selfishly taking advantage\u201d of Calvin and treating him \u201clike a stranger.\u201d I told these people that if they\u2019re so concerned, they can help house Calvin and provide him with childcare.

It\u2019s rude AF for them to comment in any way, much less critically. It\u2019s an important lesson for you. If you can\u2019t shut down those people, how will you manage Calvin\u2019s boundary breaking?  It\u2019s important you learn not to succumb to manipulation.", "NTA , but you\u2019d be the AH to yourself if you let him move in.  It\u2019s not going to end well for you.

You are offering him a place to live in a place that that he would otherwise not be able to afford. \n\nIs requiring someone to pay rent on time cruel now? Letting a parent know that you will not be a free babysitter so they can screw around instead of raising their own child taking advantage of them?\n\nYou don't have to let them move in at all.

You are getting equity in the house and a renter is not. While the owner has additional costs,  the building is yours.  \n\nI know some landlords do it that way, though so it is your call.

You probably will have trouble getting him to pay, but with a lease it will be easier to evict him when that happens.\n\nAlso;\n\n>the possibility of being seen as a cliche person who peaked in high school\n\nIt sure sounds like he did peak in high school.", "NTA. Also, I\u2019m an attorney and absolutely agree that he will not pay rent. I\u2019m kind of amazed he\u2019s even complaining about the amount because he knows he\u2019s not going to pay it. Once he gets in your house, he\u2019ll act just like he did at your dad\u2019s.  You won\u2019t get rent and you\u2019ll incur extra expenses trying to get him evicted", "This OP.\n\nNTA.

They probably have plenty of room for Calvin up on that high horse they\u2019re sitting on.", "And you will be doing 100% of the housework and caring for his son.", "Exactly this.", "NTA.

He should 100% be out there trying to find his own place and a job. He is 29 years old. How long does he get to act like a child?", "NTA - There is a difference between being kind and being an enabler. Calvin is not looking for kindness or assistance, he is looking for a FT babysitter, a free place to stay, and more reasons to go live his life with no responsibilities.\n\nEnabling him isn't going to help him grow the heck up, and isn't setting a good example for his child.\n\nAdults work, manage bills, take care of their home, take care of and raise their kids. It's time for Calvin to grow up and learn to 'adult'.\n\nYou are an exceptional big sister for being the one to set actual BOUNDARIES and force him to be a parent and not act like a teenager with no responsibilities.

He's way late in the game to stop worrying about 'peaking in HS' and start worrying more about adulting before his 3rd decade.

Stick to your guns and don't let him move in unless he agrees to your terms. You're not responsible for fixing his mistakes.", "Not sure about what\u2019s so bad for him to actually get a retail job? If he needs the money then he should go and get one, it\u2019ll likely take a while but he at least will be able to pay for rent", "NTA, but do not let Calvin move in.

Don't do it. Tell Calvin that he needs to make his own living arrangements, and then back away from the situation. And if anyone calls you selfish, embrace it - sometimes we need to be selfish to protect ourselves from those who'd take advantage of us.

Calvin doesn\u2019t want to pay a fair rent, or get a job, and you\u2019re supposed to allow this because\u2026 why?", "NTA.  You\u2019re not treating him like a stranger at all.

Don't let him move in. He won't pay rent, he will sneak out and leave you with the nephew, thinking the CPS is just an empty theat that you would never actually do.
