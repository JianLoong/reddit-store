Some background information is that, for most of the year, Aiden goes to his mom Lillie\u2019s (31F) every other week. However, Lillie runs a business that largely caters to summer tourists. So between now and the end of August, Aiden only goes to his mom\u2019s house every other weekend since Lillie is working 16-hour days.\n\nBecause Aiden was born right before quarantine, our Dad allowed Calvin to move back in with him rent-free, only asking for a little bit of help around the house, so Calvin wouldn\u2019t have to work in-person and possibly risk his or Aiden\u2019s health. Calvin took complete advantage of our Dad\u2019s kindness. He constantly partied, wouldn\u2019t contribute around the house, and lied about why he \u201cneeded\u201d Dad to watch Aiden.\n\nDad has tried reasoning with Calvin for years, but Calvin has just blown him off and Dad\u2019s had enough. He stood up to Calvin and said he is done with Calvin taking advantage of his kindness, and that it isn\u2019t fair to him to be treated as a private daycare for Aiden while Calvin\u2019s out drinking like a frat boy. He gave Calvin four months to figure out actual childcare or work out a new custody arrangement with Lillie and then move out.\n\nWe are now two weeks away from the move-out date that our Dad gave Calvin. Calvin was seemingly just hoping for Dad to give up and resume their current living/childcare situation. Calvin is only accepting now that our Dad is serious and isn\u2019t going to back down on this. Our local housing market is awful (think SoCal levels of crazy expensive.) Calvin came to me asking to move in with me.\n\nI made it very clear that if Calvin does move in, he is paying rent on-time with no exceptions. And I am not going to provide childcare for Aiden. Unless it\u2019s an emergency (not \u201cThe babysitter cancelled and I \u201cneed\u201d to go to this party!\u201d) I am not going to be babysitting him. If he tries to dump Aiden on me, I will report Aiden to CPS as abandoned so that they can contact Lillie to come and pick Aiden up.\n\nCalvin is begging for a discount because he says the rent I am asking (Exactly half of what the mortgage costs me every month) is too high and he would have to get a part-time retail job. Calvin and his high school friends were not very nice to certain people. He\u2019s afraid of someone recognizing him and the possibility of being seen as a cliche person who peaked in high school. I told Calvin I don\u2019t care. Swallow your pride, suck it up, and grow up. I\u2019m already offering a fair rent, and I won\u2019t have him taking advantage of me the way he did with Dad.\n\nOthers have called me out and accused me of \u201ccoldly and selfishly taking advantage\u201d of Calvin and treating him \u201clike a stranger.\u201d I told these people that if they\u2019re so concerned, they can help house Calvin and provide him with childcare. This got most of them to clam up, but two said that they aren\u2019t Calvin\u2019s sister and that \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you, Sarah\u201d for being \u201cshrewd\u201d to Calvin instead of showing him more kindness.

Yes you are his sister, you are supporting him by letting him move in. He\u2019s also your brother, and should support you by helping that transition.
