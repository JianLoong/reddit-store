So between now and the end of August, Aiden only goes to his mom\u2019s house every other weekend since Lillie is working 16-hour days.\n\nBecause Aiden was born right before quarantine, our Dad allowed Calvin to move back in with him rent-free, only asking for a little bit of help around the house, so Calvin wouldn\u2019t have to work in-person and possibly risk his or Aiden\u2019s health. Calvin took complete advantage of our Dad\u2019s kindness. He constantly partied, wouldn\u2019t contribute around the house, and lied about why he \u201cneeded\u201d Dad to watch Aiden.\n\nDad has tried reasoning with Calvin for years, but Calvin has just blown him off and Dad\u2019s had enough. He stood up to Calvin and said he is done with Calvin taking advantage of his kindness, and that it isn\u2019t fair to him to be treated as a private daycare for Aiden while Calvin\u2019s out drinking like a frat boy. He gave Calvin four months to figure out actual childcare or work out a new custody arrangement with Lillie and then move out.\n\nWe are now two weeks away from the move-out date that our Dad gave Calvin. Calvin was seemingly just hoping for Dad to give up and resume their current living/childcare situation. Calvin is only accepting now that our Dad is serious and isn\u2019t going to back down on this. Our local housing market is awful (think SoCal levels of crazy expensive.) Calvin came to me asking to move in with me.\n\nI made it very clear that if Calvin does move in, he is paying rent on-time with no exceptions. And I am not going to provide childcare for Aiden.

If he tries to dump Aiden on me, I will report Aiden to CPS as abandoned so that they can contact Lillie to come and pick Aiden up.\n\nCalvin is begging for a discount because he says the rent I am asking (Exactly half of what the mortgage costs me every month) is too high and he would have to get a part-time retail job. Calvin and his high school friends were not very nice to certain people. He\u2019s afraid of someone recognizing him and the possibility of being seen as a cliche person who peaked in high school. I told Calvin I don\u2019t care. Swallow your pride, suck it up, and grow up. I\u2019m already offering a fair rent, and I won\u2019t have him taking advantage of me the way he did with Dad.\n\nOthers have called me out and accused me of \u201ccoldly and selfishly taking advantage\u201d of Calvin and treating him \u201clike a stranger.\u201d I told these people that if they\u2019re so concerned, they can help house Calvin and provide him with childcare.

Like even if he wanted to get a job and be a decent person he's so far from that at the moment that he won't be able to pull it off, only with years of work on himself will he maybe be able to remake himself. In the meantime everyone who tries to help him will be burned horribly by his behaviour. So yeah, he won't pay, he may get a job but he'll likely lose it soon after, he'll leave his kid with OP without telling her, etc. He needs to decide he wants to change and then needs to put years of work in and that won't happen as long as people keep supporting him.\n\nThe problem is he has a child that's dependent on him, that will lead people to providing him help he doesn't deserve and he'll likely just start using his kid as a tool to feed his addiction to this lifestyle. The kid's mom needs to know what's happening.", "You and u/CandyShopBandit are both right. I will direct Calvin to some cheap apartments in our area and tell him that my rent offer is off the table.\n\nI know that, if Calvin refuses to get his shit together, or tries to do anything stupid, child services will be able to contact Lillie and she will take in Aiden. \n\nWithout Dad as his safety net/enabler, Calvin should hopefully be motivated to grow up and get his shit together. And if not, my nephew is still taken care of.", "This is the only right solution OP. Your brother needs some tough love so he finally gets his act together. In the long run that will be best for him, his son and you and your father. Stand your ground and ignore people that have no say in the matter at all. Good luck\n\nOh and inform the child's mother so she has a heads up in case he fails to get his act together.", "Honey, don't direct him to anything. He has to learn all this. It's on him 100% now. Even giving him a pinch of help shows that you care, and then he might come back and beg. \"Calvin, I will not have you live with me due to your behavior towards Dad. Go call your buddies. Good night\" no holes or questions in there to argue with. Yes, feel bad for the kid. If you say I'll watch him this weekend, he will live with you. Keep CPS in mind if he is not being cared for.", "I have already reached out to Lillie about it, and so has my Dad. She has made it very clear to Calvin that, if he tries anything stupid, she will take Aiden and make sure Calvin gets no custody.\n\nNow that Calvin knows he's lost all his safety nets/enabler in our Dad, hopefully, it will be the kick he needs to grow up and get his shit together. And if not, my nephew will still be taken care of by Lillie.", "You need to not discuss this with those people. \nYou need to be \u201cshrewd\u201d with your brother because his selfishness has him being kicked out of his own father\u2019s house, because he was given tons of notice and did nothing, because he wants you to put out the fire he created.  If course you are right.  Your brother has not moved in with you but is already negotiating for you to not get a fair contribution from him for the burden his living with you will place on you. \n\nHe claims he can\u2019t afford his own place.  You offer him a place for half what you are paying.  He feels abused.  \nWhy is it that you have sorted out your living situation in So.Cal but people feel he shouldn\u2019t be expected to do that for himself?  \n\nDon\u2019t let him move in.  Withdraw any offer made.  He needs to understand he is a grown man, a father, and he had a free ride at his dad\u2019s during which he did zip to save and prepare for the future. \n\nIf you let him move in, any agreement he makes, he will break. He will always have excuses for not paying the rent. Once he is in your home, you will have no leverage other than kicking him out. If you then kick him out, you will be told you are evil and that you are hurting his child, etc.  Better to refuse to let him move in and remind people who think you are awful that his own father kicked him out and you have every right not to put up with what his own father wouldn\u2019t put up with. \n\nHe will be late with rent. Then he will pay most but not all; then he will lose his job, stop paying rent, eat your food, take over your living room, have his friends over \nAnd they will criticize you for not feeding them, hosting them, taking care of his son.\n\nYou know this will happen.  You also know that if you found a place to live so can he.  The reason he won\u2019t is because a landlord would evict him and he assumes family won\u2019t.  Look how long it took your father to get fed up.  Your brother is a Peter Pan.  He is a perpetual teenager and will never grow up if he doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nTell him he can join the military for free room and board.  He can apply to the merchant marine academy to learn a trade, learn how to follow rules, learn how to be responsible, and grow up.  He does have options.  He just doesn\u2019t like them.  \n\nDon\u2019t be a sucker!", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nYour brother has already abused your father's trust and is not apt to change. Don't let Calvin do it to you as well. I feel terrible for your nephew.", "You are NTA but no matter what payment contract you put in place he us not going to pay you rent, and living with him will be unbearable.

He\u2019s had your father\u2019s kindness and you can see how well that\u2019s worked out. Don\u2019t let him move in.

It is so predictable that people are playing the \u201cbut fAmILy\u201d card.Turn it around on them.  He shouldn\u2019t disrespect his father the way that he has.

You are protecting yourself.", "NTA. if he decides to move in with you make sure you get everything in writing on an actual lease agreement and then have it notarized so you can force him out if he doesn\u2019t pay rent on time.

Otherwise, he's going to keep taking advantage of everyone around him until he truly has no one left and hits rock bottom (which he'll blame everyone else for, not himself)\n\nLet him learn his lessons on his own now.

It's extra hard to throw someone out when they're family and have a child that you become close to and know that they won't be well cared for if you're not around.

Time to put the partying lifestyle behind him and be a responsible parent!! Do not become his built in babysitter or let him take advantage of your kindness!! Maybe he should of been a better person during high school!! Society owes your brother nothing!! Cash, grass, or ass no one rides for free!! Half the mortgage as rent ensures a roof over his head along with his child\u2019s!! Good grief, he should be taking parenting classes to learn how to be an actual parent!! Tread with caution op!!
