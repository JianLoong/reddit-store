So between now and the end of August, Aiden only goes to his mom\u2019s house every other weekend since Lillie is working 16-hour days.\n\nBecause Aiden was born right before quarantine, our Dad allowed Calvin to move back in with him rent-free, only asking for a little bit of help around the house, so Calvin wouldn\u2019t have to work in-person and possibly risk his or Aiden\u2019s health. Calvin took complete advantage of our Dad\u2019s kindness. He constantly partied, wouldn\u2019t contribute around the house, and lied about why he \u201cneeded\u201d Dad to watch Aiden.\n\nDad has tried reasoning with Calvin for years, but Calvin has just blown him off and Dad\u2019s had enough. He stood up to Calvin and said he is done with Calvin taking advantage of his kindness, and that it isn\u2019t fair to him to be treated as a private daycare for Aiden while Calvin\u2019s out drinking like a frat boy. He gave Calvin four months to figure out actual childcare or work out a new custody arrangement with Lillie and then move out.\n\nWe are now two weeks away from the move-out date that our Dad gave Calvin. Calvin was seemingly just hoping for Dad to give up and resume their current living/childcare situation. Calvin is only accepting now that our Dad is serious and isn\u2019t going to back down on this. Our local housing market is awful (think SoCal levels of crazy expensive.) Calvin came to me asking to move in with me.\n\nI made it very clear that if Calvin does move in, he is paying rent on-time with no exceptions. And I am not going to provide childcare for Aiden.

If he tries to dump Aiden on me, I will report Aiden to CPS as abandoned so that they can contact Lillie to come and pick Aiden up.\n\nCalvin is begging for a discount because he says the rent I am asking (Exactly half of what the mortgage costs me every month) is too high and he would have to get a part-time retail job. Calvin and his high school friends were not very nice to certain people. He\u2019s afraid of someone recognizing him and the possibility of being seen as a cliche person who peaked in high school. I told Calvin I don\u2019t care. Swallow your pride, suck it up, and grow up. I\u2019m already offering a fair rent, and I won\u2019t have him taking advantage of me the way he did with Dad.\n\nOthers have called me out and accused me of \u201ccoldly and selfishly taking advantage\u201d of Calvin and treating him \u201clike a stranger.\u201d I told these people that if they\u2019re so concerned, they can help house Calvin and provide him with childcare.

He will not pay, he'll leave the child with you. He is absolutely going to take every advantage he can of you...look at the way he's already asking for a discount and getting other people to shame you about it. \n\nIf you do let him move in, make sure there is a contract spelling out the exact terms and conditions. Not because he'll follow the terms, but because it'll make the inevitable, future small claims court case easier to win.", "NTA and don\u2019t let him move in\u2026 it\u2019ll end up in years of resentment from all parties.", "NTA No piece of paper is going to make him pay rent or be a better parent. He has lifetime of ingrained responsibility avoidance strategies and  he will use every single one of them rather than behave like he cares about anyone other than himself. Don\u2019t let him move in. Some nameless people are disappointed in you? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll lose no sleep over their concern.", "NTA. Good on you for being clear in expectations. Calvin needs to get with reality. He will never be a self sufficient adult if he relies on other people to prop up jis lifestyle.", "NTA. And I agree about not trusting him . I wouldn't let him move in at all. A lease won't mean much in reality. It's not like she can just wave it at him and he's magically teleported out the door. He has messed around for nearly 4 months, so he won't take his sister seriously either. \n\nAnd as for being too good for a retail job.....well, if he is, where's the big wages and high status career then? He sounds like a \"failure to launch\" type arsehole  and  a dose of reality will do him good. And the sooner the better, as he's already 29. Think \n of all the cash he's wasting on whooping it up with his mates. He could have saved that. He's a father. He should be working hard to provide a life for his child, not expecting others to do it.", "NTA.  It would be a mistake to allow them to move in at all.  Even with a signed lease/rental agreement, if he moved in & never paid you a dime, it could take weeks or even months to evict him.  \n\nThey don\u2019t have to be Calvin\u2019s sister to help him - so that\u2019s just their excuse to try to guilt you into doing something they aren\u2019t willing to do themselves.  Don\u2019t let family guilt you into putting yourself into a precarious situation.", "Contracts are difficult to enforce when it's family and someone puts their foot down and says they won't pay.\n\nYou might get away with not baby sitting ie calling CPS for an abandoned child.  But it can take months to evict someone for non payment of rent.... esp the bleeding heart where he has no money so can't afford anything so has to stay...", "THIS. He HAD a place to live. All he had to do was stop being a disrespectful bum, and he couldn't/wouldn't do it!!", "Yes. It sounds like he has never grown up. The only people I feel sorry for are Lillie and Aiden", "She's the asshole to herself if she lets him move in, even if he miraculously gets a job. She doesn't understand the risks involved.\n\nA lease will not help her. He will still take months to evict *when* he doesn't pay. It's not if. It's when. He just did it to dad. Thinking a few new \"rules\" and a lease is going to change anything is laughable.\n\nHe is an *intentionally* unemployed, irresponsible partier, with self-admitted bully partier friends. She can ban them, but he has no respect for her, so he will invite them when she isn't there, and he will not respect her belongings or peace. His friends may steal or damage the home even if he doesn't somehow. He has proven he won't clean or help or show gratitude\n. He will eat her food and use her stuff. He will expect her to buy stuff for the kid, and she will, because she has a heart.\n\nThis is going to be a huge, unfortunate learning lesson for OP if she lets him move in. He will likely damage the house over the long period it takes to legally evict him, because that is what disrespectful, entitled people do, which he has proven to be. If she locks him out, he can sue her. It takes only a week in some states to gain residency in a home, lease or no! After that you must legally evict them or face consequences.\n\nOp could get in trouble if he has druggie friends among the partiers, or if they drive drunk after hanging out with brother, or get hurt doing something stupid on her property, she is liable.\n\nHe won't get a job to support his own kid properly because he's too entitled to work retail apparently.\n He sure won't get one just to pay OP if he wouldn't for his father.\n\nOP, he's already shown you how he will act. Believe him the first time, and read up on how hard it is to evict people. It's a nightmare and extremely expensive, even in the very rare cases where ungrateful, disrespectful guests somehow *don't* damage the home or room. I know all this because I've seen it happen to a lot of folks who just wanted to help family or friends who are irresponsible and entitled, and they ended up in a nightmare.\n\nIf he was just a decent, helpful, respectful person to your dad while he helped him, he wouldn't even need your help. Don't be his next mark to take advantage of. He isn't going to change suddenly. He's a thirty-year-old father. He can figure his own shit out.", "Reply to all the assholes \"Due to continued harassment, the offer to move in has been rescinded. I will tell Aiden that Person X and Person Y have expressed concern for his living situation and have him contact you for assistance.\"", "I might have missed it  but doesn't have have a regular job? Is he well educated?", "NTA but he\u2019ll never pay you and it will be extremely hard to kick him out if he doesn\u2019t want to leave", "You said this so well.", "My take was he was working g some kind of remote work, and the retail job would be in addition to afford rent"]}
