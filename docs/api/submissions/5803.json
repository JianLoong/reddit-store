It recently came to light that I was spending my days as a mailman on the phone while i worked. An old friend of mine was going through some emotional stuff, and she called me many times a day, and we would spend up to three hours a day on the phone, talking.\n\nIt was not romantic, as we are just friends. It came to light when I happened to still be home on a Monday morning, and she called. My girlfriend asked who it was, thinking it must be a doctor, but I told her it was my friend. My girlfriend asked what friend is calling at 9am on a Monday? \n\nSo i told her about my friend, and that we talk sometimes. The conversation continued and i finally showed her my call logs, which, in retrospect, more extensive than I realized. Some of the calls were over 2 hours long, and many of the days had 6+ calls, totaling more than 3-4 hours.\n\nMy girlfriend insists this is emotional infidelity, and I told her she's jealous and insecure. We tried to get past it, and I stopped communication with my friend, but I still don't think what I did was emotional cheating. My girlfriend insists that emotional infidelity doesn't have to be romantic, that it is just a substantial relationship outside of your primary relationship.\n\nAlso, when this started, I hadn't heard from my friend in months or longer, so my friend started calling me repeatedly, I thought it was a little strange, and was sure to tell her I had a girlfriend. When she kept calling, I assumed there wasn't a romantic interest, so I thought it was ok to talk to her. \n\nI don't think i did anything wrong, AITA?

Honestly, if I'd been your girlfriend I'd have dumped you too. \n\nYou may have been taken advantage of by this hopelessly needy friend, but you let yourself get sucked into it and made no effort to un-suck yourself. Three hours a day on the phone to *anyone* is ridiculous.", "YTA. That is an exorbitant amount of time to be talking to anyone and you need to learn how to set healthy boundaries. It is extremely suspicious that you are only talking to this woman while you're at work. It's easy to see why your wife is uncomfortable. The icing on the cake is you calling her jealous and insecure for being uncomfortable with her boyfriend talking to a woman for over 3 hours every day and only when she isn't around.

This is something that shouldn't happen when you are in a relationship and this is a very normal boundary to have. \n\n\n>I told her she's jealous and insecure\n\nActually no. She just has good boundaries and understands some things most people aren't okay with their SO calling a friend for 3+ hours daily when they had... a breakup. This is something you do for your best friend when they loose a parent and you **talk** to your SO about this.", "A few issues here:\n\n1. Unless your job is okay with you being on personal calls for 3-4 hours out of your 8-10 hour day for a month, you may lose your job if someone complains\n2.

What problems is she having that she requires 3-4 hours of assistance daily? She may need therapy, not someone who may or may not be there in the future depending on how your talk with your girlfriend goes with boundaries\n4. Your girlfriend does not know it\u2019s not romantic. The fact is your friend is taking up significant portion of your time on a daily basis and that can be alarming to your girlfriend\n5. I personally find it very strange that your friend doesn\u2019t need emotional support during the weekend when you\u2019re home and only needs it during working hours where you will be away from your girl friend, despite her needing so much of your time on the weekdays\n\nIn short, soft YTA.

Why did said friend choose you to speak to so in-depth as a source of support/does she have anyone else for support? It doesn't sound like it if she's calling you that much. What are you talking about with her when you're on the phone that long?\n\n>My girlfriend insists that emotional infidelity doesn't have to be romantic, that it is just a substantial relationship outside of your primary relationship.\n\nThis is partially true, partially not. In my opinion, for there to be emotional infidelity it's not just about supporting someone else going through a hard time. You have to be supported by them as well and receiving something in return. I don't know if that's the case here, but I don't think it's as simple as \"a substantial relationship outside of your primary relationship\" because you could have that with friends that aren't women. \n\nWhat I think the bigger issue is here, is this person who your girlfriend had not heard of prior to this is now taking up 4+ hours of your day most days. She needs to have someone that isn't you to support her.", "YTA. You have to realize that talking to the same person, multiple times a day for extended periods is very sketchy.

It's almost like you're giving this other woman more attention than your own girlfriend.  \n\nTell her that you can talk to her, but you can't have these long drawn out 6-hour long conversations.  She's using you as some sort of therapist, which isn't terrible but you also need to recognize you have your own life and your own relationship.\n\nYou're investing energy into something that is distracting you from your own relationship.", "You\u2019d have to be pretty obtuse to not see how this is problematic (and apparently a deal breaker) from your girlfriend's perspective.\n\nI don't know if you're being deliberately obtuse or genuinely obtuse, but either way exhibiting that level of disregard for your girlfriend's point of view makes you an AH \n\nYTA", "Wow, you *are* borderline emotionally cheating if you aren\u2019t already doing so.

You\u2019ve already crossed it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not because you were being a caring person to be there for your friend or because you wanted to help her out with her situation, *but your spouse had no idea about this*. Why did you practically keep it a secret in the first place? Do you only talk to her when you\u2019re away at work to make sure you don\u2019t raise suspicions with your girlfriend? \n\nEven if you have no romantic interest in this woman, this woman definitely has a romantic interest in you.

Well, maybe I should say your ex girlfriend.", "By \"old friend\" do you actually mean \"old GIRLfriend\"?", "YTA.  Emotional affair, plain and simple.", "YTA \n\nDon\u2019t pretend that if this was your girlfriend and another guy that you wouldn\u2019t be upset and question your relationship. \n\nMy best friend of years and years is a guy. Yes, we are there for each other but not to the point it\u2019s impacted on our intimate relationships.

Would you be ok if she was talking for hours everyday to her a random male friend who needs \"emotional support?\" That says it right there, emotional support = emotional infidelity. Seriously, how stupid can you be? She needs to dump you based on that alone!", "YTA but you don\u2019t seem like a bad person. There are couple things to think about here. If your gf\u2019s response was a sharp outburst I would understand confusion, but consider a few things about your discussions with your friend:\n\n1. is it normal for this friend to dedicate so much time to getting through tribulations in her life? You mentioned she\u2019s getting through a breakup, so I can absolutely understand why your gf is upset you are dedicating so much time and attention to another woman\u2019s sudden emotional needs and wants.\n\n2. Is it normal for YOU to dedicate this much time and attention to the needs of a friend? Your girlfriend might feel like there is a severe imbalance with the emotional attention you have given her in the past vs. the attention and time you gave your friend. Would you give/ have you given your girlfriend this much of your time regarding her personal issues?\n\n3. Hard YTA for telling your girlfriend that she\u2019s jealous and insecure. The duration of the calls and subject absolutely matters. You\u2019re talking to another woman daily for HOURS about recovering from a romantic and intimate situation. Does your friend really need this much time to talk about it? More specifically, why did she go to YOU? Does your friend not have other people (and other friends who are women) who she feels like she can talk to about this? Ask yourself why she is going to you, and only you, specifically. Even if you have no romantic intentions, it is completely understandable why your girlfriend feels uncomfortable with this dynamic", "Honestly, YTA. I\u2019m not sure how you didn\u2019t realize how inappropriate this was/is on your part. Your (ex) girlfriend is smart to dump you.", "YTA. You\u2019re cheating on your gf. Stop lying.", "YTA.

I don't think you're emotionally cheating, but 3+ hours a day is grossly excessive.

Back off the friend and be there for your SO.", "YTA for investing that much time and emotional energy on \"another woman\" (on the clock or not) without keeping your girlfriend in the loop.

Everyone else is.\n\nBy the way, what the tell is emotional cheating?\n\nSeems like yet another millennial term, so they can breakup or find fault in someone.\n\nGeeze Louise.. Get a clue millennials.", "HARD YTA!!! If the tables were turned would you put up with this shit?!\n\nYour gf has the right to draw boundaries\u2026 it might not be emotional\nInfidelity now\u2026 but it risks escalating into one. Why invite unnecessary risks?", "YTA- that\u2019s a significant amount of time you\u2019re spending being the emotional crutch for your friend. You are not her therapist. You hadn\u2019t spoken in months, so it\u2019s safe to say she has other friends she should be sharing the load with. You are not single, she knows this, but you never set reasonable boundaries for the friendship and you allowed her to become emotionally dependent on you. It doesn\u2019t matter if the intention was romantic or not, the only person who should be that dependent on you is your partner, or maybe a sibling or a best friend in which neither of you are attracted to each other\u2019s gender.", "At first I was gonna go with not. People are allowed to have friends, even if the opposite gender that are good enough friends to talk to for hours on end, especially after trauma. However after reading on and seeing some follow up in comments I\u2019m going with YTA. Hard YTA. You\u2019ve got to be blind to think that this is all strictly platonic. She was right to break up with you and I would too. I hope you two can work it out and you can learn and grow from this, but I\u2019m not betting on it. If you can\u2019t see that what you did was wrong, you\u2019ve got some learning to do.", "I have a platonic friend that I\u2019ve known for about 7 years now. We talk almost every day, and all day now that I work from home. (Edit to add: at least until my partner gets off work)\n\nMy partner and all of my previous partners have known about her and hers as well. They\u2019ve even talked on the phone at times too. She\u2019s my best friend and idk if I would have gotten through the pandemic without her when I was single. \n\nI say all that too say, your \u201cfriend\u201d seems to either be using you a therapist, pining for you to be her next relationship or both. And the fact that you have conveniently forgot to tell your girlfriend about this new, old friend and how long you guys have communicated gives her a reason to be suspicious. There\u2019s not a day that goes by where I don\u2019t mention to my partner if I\u2019ve talked to *my* friend or not because I have nothing to hide. You are acting like you do. \n\nYTA", "YTA OP, your gf is feeling threatened and you undermine her feelings. there's a valid reason for her insecurities and the main culprit is you. you may think it's nothing when you talk to another girl for 3-4 hours. but, how sure are you that the other party doesn't have any ulterior motives? you're saying you haven't contacted each other for a while and yet now, she's dumping her emotional baggage on you? think about it. doesn't she have any other friends she can talk to? or are you really uninterested as you claim to be? i think it's bs if you're going to say you have no attachment other than wanting to be a friend. no one would prioritize somebody else over their partner unless they don't care anymore for said partner.", "NTA One of my friends had been emotionally scarred by a guy she was dating as he was one of those guys where if she was mad at him he's threaten to commit respawn. She'd call me crying having panic attacks for months afterwards and we'd stay on call for hours, at first me calming her down. But afterwards once she was mostly calm I'd start talking about topics she had interest in to make sure she didn't revert back into a panic. It wasn't easy and my gf at the time didn't understand and would also get mad at me. You're getting all these Y-T-A comments for ignoring your girlfriend or not telling her you were on a call with someone who was suffering. But honestly, I don't think there would have been any need to unless she asked. You were just trying to be the best friend you could and if people are gonna blame you for that? Then they're the real AHs", "Im not going to vote but if your girlfriend is setting a boundary, and you don\u2019t respect it you are going to lose her.\n\nThis friend started calling you for HOURS out of your day while your gf isn\u2019t around. Would you feel comfortable if the show was on the other foot? If you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with her doing the exact same thing that makes you an asshole for sure.\n\nThis other friend is spend ALOT of her spare time with you. You may not realize it but she may have a motive there.\n\nJust some food for thought.", "Who in earth complains about a mailman being on the phone?", "What about her? She can be on the phone at work that much during work hours.", "Seriously. Even allowing that this might be bad -- and it could well be -- that's a really worrisome definition, and I wouldn't find myself in a relationship long with someone who actually felt that way.", "My bet is that this has been going on for a lot longer than has been implied.   \n\n\n* In a relationship for years, but gfriend doesn't know the friend?\n* Hadn't talked to friend in months \\*\\*when the phone calls started\\*\\*, and had to tell friend he was in a relationship. Not \"remind\", \"tell\". This suggests years. YEARS.\n* Only hears from friend during his regular work hours. This \"came to light\" because he was home when friend thought he was safely at work.\n* He never mentioned it to gfriend. That's deliberate. If he truly \"thought it was a little strange\", that's the kind of stuff you mention.   \n\n\nINFO: how long has this been going on, OP? why doesn't your girlfriend know this friend? \n\nAbsolutely YTA.", "I know my mail carrier is coming up the sidewalk because I can hear him talking on his phone. Pretty much every day, he's on his phone.\n\nIf it's against the rules, I'd think he'd get in trouble by now for it.", "I think you hit the nail on the head with being up front about it. My boss is a guy and I'm a girl. We're both married, but we've become almost best friends. My husband knows about all of our conversations.  Pretty much all of the work conversations, but absolutely 100% of the non-work conversations. We had dinner together on a work trip? Husband knows about it. We're both staying late to prep for an audit? Husband knows about it. \n\nBut we also know our boundaries and don't talk about things like sex or complain about our spouses to each other, outside of trivial \"I hate how often he clears his throat when we both work from home\" or \"She says um too much in her work meetings.\"", "It's possible she worded it this way because she's wary of what's going on but isn't great at putting her feelings into words, or even doesn't fully understand herself why it upsets her. Maybe she was trying to relay a feeling of, \"you talk to this girl so much more than you do me and it makes me feel jealous because I don't even get that kind of time with you,\" but couldn't find the words or pinpoint exactly what she was feeling. I honestly think a lot of conflict happens just because people don't know how to find the words for what they feel.", "Funny how you don't say nothing if he either drives or does his route on foot... Why not?", "Cause we don\u2019t know if he does or not?\n\nWhich is also why my posts have the word unless on there?\n\nI\u2019m a bit confused on why this is an issue? I have never posted that he does or doesn\u2019t.\n\nWhat I posted was: unless his work is okay with him being on personal calls for 3-4 hours a day and: unless he is delivering by foot for all of those times.\n\nCan you clarify why this is an issue?"]}
