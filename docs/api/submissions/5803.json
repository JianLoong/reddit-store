It recently came to light that I was spending my days as a mailman on the phone while i worked. An old friend of mine was going through some emotional stuff, and she called me many times a day, and we would spend up to three hours a day on the phone, talking.\n\nIt was not romantic, as we are just friends. It came to light when I happened to still be home on a Monday morning, and she called. My girlfriend asked who it was, thinking it must be a doctor, but I told her it was my friend. My girlfriend asked what friend is calling at 9am on a Monday? \n\nSo i told her about my friend, and that we talk sometimes. The conversation continued and i finally showed her my call logs, which, in retrospect, more extensive than I realized. Some of the calls were over 2 hours long, and many of the days had 6+ calls, totaling more than 3-4 hours.\n\nMy girlfriend insists this is emotional infidelity, and I told her she's jealous and insecure. We tried to get past it, and I stopped communication with my friend, but I still don't think what I did was emotional cheating. My girlfriend insists that emotional infidelity doesn't have to be romantic, that it is just a substantial relationship outside of your primary relationship.\n\nAlso, when this started, I hadn't heard from my friend in months or longer, so my friend started calling me repeatedly, I thought it was a little strange, and was sure to tell her I had a girlfriend. When she kept calling, I assumed there wasn't a romantic interest, so I thought it was ok to talk to her. \n\nI don't think i did anything wrong, AITA?

Honestly, if I'd been your girlfriend I'd have dumped you too. \n\nYou may have been taken advantage of by this hopelessly needy friend, but you let yourself get sucked into it and made no effort to un-suck yourself. Three hours a day on the phone to *anyone* is ridiculous.", "YTA. That is an exorbitant amount of time to be talking to anyone and you need to learn how to set healthy boundaries. It is extremely suspicious that you are only talking to this woman while you're at work. It's easy to see why your wife is uncomfortable. The icing on the cake is you calling her jealous and insecure for being uncomfortable with her boyfriend talking to a woman for over 3 hours every day and only when she isn't around.

This is something that shouldn't happen when you are in a relationship and this is a very normal boundary to have. \n\n\n>I told her she's jealous and insecure\n\nActually no. She just has good boundaries and understands some things most people aren't okay with their SO calling a friend for 3+ hours daily when they had... a breakup. This is something you do for your best friend when they loose a parent and you **talk** to your SO about this.", "A few issues here:\n\n1. Unless your job is okay with you being on personal calls for 3-4 hours out of your 8-10 hour day for a month, you may lose your job if someone complains\n2.

What problems is she having that she requires 3-4 hours of assistance daily? She may need therapy, not someone who may or may not be there in the future depending on how your talk with your girlfriend goes with boundaries\n4. Your girlfriend does not know it\u2019s not romantic. The fact is your friend is taking up significant portion of your time on a daily basis and that can be alarming to your girlfriend\n5. I personally find it very strange that your friend doesn\u2019t need emotional support during the weekend when you\u2019re home and only needs it during working hours where you will be away from your girl friend, despite her needing so much of your time on the weekdays\n\nIn short, soft YTA.

What are you talking about with her when you're on the phone that long?\n\n>My girlfriend insists that emotional infidelity doesn't have to be romantic, that it is just a substantial relationship outside of your primary relationship.\n\nThis is partially true, partially not. In my opinion, for there to be emotional infidelity it's not just about supporting someone else going through a hard time. You have to be supported by them as well and receiving something in return. I don't know if that's the case here, but I don't think it's as simple as \"a substantial relationship outside of your primary relationship\" because you could have that with friends that aren't women. \n\nWhat I think the bigger issue is here, is this person who your girlfriend had not heard of prior to this is now taking up 4+ hours of your day most days. She needs to have someone that isn't you to support her.", "YTA. You have to realize that talking to the same person, multiple times a day for extended periods is very sketchy.

It's almost like you're giving this other woman more attention than your own girlfriend.  \n\nTell her that you can talk to her, but you can't have these long drawn out 6-hour long conversations.  She's using you as some sort of therapist, which isn't terrible but you also need to recognize you have your own life and your own relationship.\n\nYou're investing energy into something that is distracting you from your own relationship.", "You\u2019d have to be pretty obtuse to not see how this is problematic (and apparently a deal breaker) from your girlfriend's perspective.\n\nI don't know if you're being deliberately obtuse or genuinely obtuse, but either way exhibiting that level of disregard for your girlfriend's point of view makes you an AH \n\nYTA", "Wow, you *are* borderline emotionally cheating if you aren\u2019t already doing so.

You\u2019ve already crossed it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not because you were being a caring person to be there for your friend or because you wanted to help her out with her situation, *but your spouse had no idea about this*. Why did you practically keep it a secret in the first place? Do you only talk to her when you\u2019re away at work to make sure you don\u2019t raise suspicions with your girlfriend? \n\nEven if you have no romantic interest in this woman, this woman definitely has a romantic interest in you.

Well, maybe I should say your ex girlfriend.", "By \"old friend\" do you actually mean \"old GIRLfriend\"?", "YTA.  Emotional affair, plain and simple.", "YTA \n\nDon\u2019t pretend that if this was your girlfriend and another guy that you wouldn\u2019t be upset and question your relationship. \n\nMy best friend of years and years is a guy. Yes, we are there for each other but not to the point it\u2019s impacted on our intimate relationships.

Would you be ok if she was talking for hours everyday to her a random male friend who needs \"emotional support?\" That says it right there, emotional support = emotional infidelity. Seriously, how stupid can you be? She needs to dump you based on that alone!", "YTA but you don\u2019t seem like a bad person. There are couple things to think about here. If your gf\u2019s response was a sharp outburst I would understand confusion, but consider a few things about your discussions with your friend:\n\n1. is it normal for this friend to dedicate so much time to getting through tribulations in her life? You mentioned she\u2019s getting through a breakup, so I can absolutely understand why your gf is upset you are dedicating so much time and attention to another woman\u2019s sudden emotional needs and wants.\n\n2. Is it normal for YOU to dedicate this much time and attention to the needs of a friend? Your girlfriend might feel like there is a severe imbalance with the emotional attention you have given her in the past vs. the attention and time you gave your friend. Would you give/ have you given your girlfriend this much of your time regarding her personal issues?\n\n3. Hard YTA for telling your girlfriend that she\u2019s jealous and insecure. The duration of the calls and subject absolutely matters. You\u2019re talking to another woman daily for HOURS about recovering from a romantic and intimate situation. Does your friend really need this much time to talk about it? More specifically, why did she go to YOU? Does your friend not have other people (and other friends who are women) who she feels like she can talk to about this? Ask yourself why she is going to you, and only you, specifically. Even if you have no romantic intentions, it is completely understandable why your girlfriend feels uncomfortable with this dynamic", "Honestly, YTA. I\u2019m not sure how you didn\u2019t realize how inappropriate this was/is on your part. Your (ex) girlfriend is smart to dump you.", "YTA. You\u2019re cheating on your gf. Stop lying.", "YTA.

I don't think you're emotionally cheating, but 3+ hours a day is grossly excessive.

Back off the friend and be there for your SO.", "YTA for investing that much time and emotional energy on \"another woman\" (on the clock or not) without keeping your girlfriend in the loop.

No she can just smell your bullshit and has the self respect to set boundaries for herself. I applaud her and she deserves far better than this rubbish. \n\nI\u2019m glad she\u2019s dumped/might be dumping you, you have zero remorse and you attacked her when she called you out. I wonder how long you\u2019ll wait before sleeping with or dating this \u201cfriend\u201d of yours. Not long, I\u2019d bet.", "So you're spending hours on the phone with her each day, but only during the week when your gf isn't around, and you never mentioned it to your gf? YTA and I'd break up with you too.", "YTA - ask yourself, do you spend 3 - 4 hours a day talking continuously with your GF?  If the answer is no (I'm guessing it is) - then *\\*drum roll\\** ..... **THAT IS EMOTIONAL CHEATING!!!**", "YTA. Your \u201cfriend \u201c is so upset over a breakup that she needs to talk to you every day EXCEPT when she knows you\u2019re with your gf\u2026\u2026", "YTA\nYour friend only called when you where at work and she knew your GF wasn't around. She knew what she was doing was wrong and so do you.", "I can't say YTA... naive is more like it.\nI think platonic relationships are possible. Why? Because I, 35F, have a best friend 33M. We've been best friends for over 15 years. No Romance ever involved. EVER.\n\nNow, best friend or not ... I don't spent everyday on the phone with him for an avg of 3 to 4 hrs.\nI never even did that with my ex.\n\nHave I had 3 to 4 hrs phone calls with my best friend? Yes. Of course I have. But maybe once every several months while we play catch up.\n\nEven after my horrible breakup, we talked for a couple of hours. That's it. Even for one of his breakups. That's it.\n\nBut dude, you are emotionally cheating on your gf and you don't even realize it. But then again, most men don't. Your friend is manipulating you and you don't even see it.\n\nI suggest cutting back, like, A LOT. Otherwise people are gonna start thinking your friend is your gf and that your gf is sister.", "YTA 100%\nI would be upset if my partner spent that much time talking to literally anyone. Let alone another female. Feelings can develop unintentionally and yeah. Just a big no.", "YTA if the first time your gf is hearing about this friend is after months of calls, you purposely hid it. You already know the answer to this question. Now you need to decide if you love her.", "Even with info, 2-3 hours a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks is inappropriate. That's 40-60  H O U R S of \"support\". I can all but guarantee you that SO did not spend that much time total talking to him.", "I agree. I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt of it just slipped his mind cause it didn\u2019t even seem like he noticed how much time he spent talking to her. He might be someone who is SUPER not aware of his surroundings.\n\nBut after finding out that the emotional help was for a breakup, you\u2019d think common sense is to tell your girlfriend about this as soon as possible.", "Yeah that\u2019s the clincher for me. If he wasn\u2019t doing anything inappropriate why didn\u2019t he tell his girlfriend? Why does this woman only call when his girlfriend isn\u2019t around? Totally inappropriate", "I mean, l don\u2019t even talk to my partner straight 3 hrs/day. We have kids, we are working and all this shit. We have to plan our time together, we don\u2019t get spontaneous 3 hrs/ daily. OP is apparently in more serious relstionship than l am\u2026", "So what gender friend should bisexual people lean on when they have a breakup?\n\nOP is an AH for not being transparent with gf about the phone calls from the beginning, and for being willfully ignorant that the amount of calls and for hours is really sketchy. Especially after barely talking to the friend prior to this.", "I don't even talk to my husband for 3-4 hours a day, every day. The problem is not the gender of the friend mostly. The problem is that the conversations are extensive in time.", "I agree with you that yes, male and female friends shouldn\u2019t be an issue of having for anyone... I think it was the amount of time they spent talking, and the fact his gf had little info on this friendship... \u201cSo I told her about my friend\u201d indicated to me that gf never met female friend.... just a little iffy....\n\n*edit", "Yeah I agree. My best friend was going through a breakup and we had maybe 4 or 5 one hour phone conversations spread out over like 2 weeks. But we normally have an hour long convo every other week, sometimes every week. We both just don\u2019t get out much because kids and work but want to \u201chang out\u201d and chat sometimes. But my husband knows, he\u2019s close friends with her too but talks to her on the phone less, but they send each other memes regularly. \n\nBut no one talks to me or my husband more than us to each other.", "Info: you keep saying \u201cIt came to light\u201d that usually implies something is being concealed or hidden. Why were you hiding this relationship from your gf?", "YTA you're lying to yourself. You have no one to blame here but yourself.", "YTA You were on the phone for HOURS working as a mailman? You should be fired. OMG! And yes, you are having an emotional affair. I sure hope she does dump you. You are not an honest person anywhere in your life IMO", "NTA, and the amount of YT/A votes is absolutely ubelievable to me. \n\nit's super unhealthy to believe any \"substantial relationship outside of your primary relationship\" is emotional infidelity. i understand that society pushes the idea that someone's romantic partner should fill 100% of their needs, but that's an extension of the unsustainable individualism that's been fostered by capitalism. throughout the majority of human history, we've depended on strong community & social networks with friends and family. it's healthy to have more than just one person with whom you're emotionally intimate (it could be a family member you're close with, a friend, or a mentor of some sort) and it can make romatic relationships stronger & better \u2014 being able to discuss part of your life with someone who's outside of the situation does wonders. \n\nthere's always things to share only with a romantic partner! but having strong friendships \u2260 cheating.\n\ni would say you could have handled the situation better by telling your girlfriend about it when your friend started calling, but there having been a way to handle it better doesn't mean you did anything wrong.", "NTA you're allowed friends. Jealousy is a disgusting trait", "Why does your friend only call you when you\u2019re at work and away from your girlfriend? Why didn\u2019t your girlfriend know you two were talking daily, or at the VERY least know who the girl was (she didn\u2019t even recognize the name when she called you)? lmao YTA, grow up before you find another girlfriend.", "YTA. This absolutely is emotional infidelity. You are carrying on an intimate relationship with this woman and spending more time talking to her than your actual partner. In what universe are you not in the wrong?", "YTA. A good friend would\u2019ve steered her to a therapist and taken care of his girlfriend. Instead you tried to play emotional boyfriend to two women to feed your ego. Enjoy your new girlfriend who doesn\u2019t know boundaries.", "YTA. It\u2019s an emotional affair at this point.", "YTA", "YTA\u2026 that is an excessive amount of talking and sounds like emotional infidelity. Why are you suddenly her support person after not talking to her for months? If you had nothing to hide, why didn\u2019t your girlfriend know you were regularly talking to another girl for HOURS until this girl called you when you were still home? If she needs someone to talk to for that amount of time, it should be with a therapist. I don\u2019t think most or any people in a relationship would be comfortable with this\u2026 I mean it sounds like you might talk to this girl more than your actual girlfriend\u2026 not a far stretch that one of you will develop feelings if you haven\u2019t already. Also a red flag that your response to your girlfriend setting reasonable boundaries was you calling her insecure.", "That is a very large degree of intimacy, and you didn't even mention it to your partner.  YTA", "\u201cIt came to light\u201d\u2026\n\nYTA because you hid it from your gf. No reason to not tell her about your daily calls if it was as innocent as you claim.", "So people way overuse \"emotional infidelity\" to define friendships and stuff but one of the signs of when a friendship starts to move towards emotional infidelity is when you aren't being honest with your partner about how much you are talking to your \"emotional affair partner\"\n\nDo with that what you will", "If you felt the need to keep this from your gf, until she found out herself, then yea, YTA.", "NTA with a huge dose of na\u00efvet\u00e9 \n\nIt isn't romantic for you **yet**. Highly charged emotional relationships often do change over time. You clearly weren't hiding it from your girlfriend, but you also weren't forthcoming either. Because we always ask each other \"how was your day?\" and a two hour call would be noteworthy, if I talked to someone on the phone for 2 hours I would be telling my husband. i.e. \"OMG My sister called me and talked my ear off for two hours. Boy is she having a rough day.\" \n\nMore importantly it also might be romantic for your friend already. Women crave talking and intimacy and you are giving her both. All of the calls were instigated by her. \n\nBeing a good friend shouldn't be punished but setting some boundaries might be warranted.", "YTA. You\u2019re either lying to your gf or yourself. This IS emotional infidelity. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is using you as her boyfriend, and you\u2019re enjoying it. Honestly, if I was your employer, I\u2019d fire you, too.", "It\u2019s funny you never mentioned it.", "NTA, your gf was upset that someone called before she even knew who it was! I'm not so sure her objection is reasonable based solely on that first reaction.", "YTA\n\nI *can* see a newly single person being that bored that they call you for hours just to have a voice to talk to, I can see it being totally innocent and platonic.\n\nWhat I don't see is how this was never mentioned to your partner. How do you spend 3 hours on the phone with someone and it NEVVER comes up in convo, like \"oh friend called today again, she's still not doing so great.\" \n\nThat long on the phone while working too sounds not the greatest for you as well as that's a huge distraction for such al ong perod of time.\n\n\"It came to light\" shows that you never intended to tell your gf about this. WHY?", "YTA. Either you\u2019re oblivious or a sucker but your friend was monopolizing your time in an unreasonable way. If she\u2019s so fragile that she needs hours of contact after a breakup, she needs a professional. She went to you because she thinks you\u2019re able to be her sponge and save her the cost of a therapist. You are providing emotional labour to someone else to the expense of your (former) relationship.", ">Unless your job is okay with you being on personal calls for 3-4 hours out of your 8-10 hour day for a month, you may lose your job if someone complains\n\nOP said they were doing this during their job as a mail carrier. A friend of mine did this job for a while, and would often call me just to chat while working, because it could be a bit dull if you run out of podcasts &c. I obviously can't speak to OP's situation, but for us, these were \\*definitely\\* the kinds of phone calls where you can't really have a proper conversation; you're more just keeping each other company on the line while you mostly do your own thing. At least on OP's part, they'd have been constantly interrupted by the practicalities of delivering the mail. I obviously can't speak to OP's actual conversations, but it's certainly the kind of thing I can see a medium-to-good friend wanting to do with someone for support, and not really the same thing as having a multi-hour, in-depth, focused conversation.", "And it\u2019s SO weird to keep it secret if it\u2019s innocent. Daily life is extremely banal. So many of the conversations in a long term relationship are about any little interesting thing that happened in your day. If I\u2019m sending my husband an outraged text about the price of eggs, how the crap are you not mentioning any details from your THREE HOUR CONVERSATION? If my husband is spending ten minutes giving me background info on the workings of his company so I can understand exactly how his coworker pissed him off today, how do you just omit that you have become a major emotional crutch for a female friend?", "Yup. If there\u2019s a situation where I genuinely think I\u2019m in the clear but it looks questionable, the first thing I do is tell my spouse. Being sent on a business trip with a coworker of the opposite sex? Mention it to your spouse. Had a couple of really long conversations with a friend about personal stuff? Mention it to your spouse. \n\nThese things come up in a marriage, and if it\u2019s all above board, it\u2019s rarely an issue. If nothing else, your partner can help you smell out potential problems before you\u2019ve gotten to the \u201ctalking while on the clock for 15 hours a week\u201d point. Or they can say, \u201cYeah, I think it\u2019s totally fine that you\u2019re splitting a couple\u2019s gym membership with our mutual friend. I know that dynamic and it\u2019s fine.\u201d But when you keep it hidden, that can and does blow up on you.", "Gosh I hope so, every mail carrier I have seen for the past couple of years is perpetually on their phone. In fact what a great way to double dip! They should all sign up to be phone sex operators! Get paid twice!", "But... do you support your friend the equivalent of a full work week over the course of a month? The math works out to 40-60 hours of \"support\"", "Girls don't call guys for help going through a breakup unless they're interested in that guy.", "YTA. This definitely brings it to the level of emotional cheating.", "It\u2019s odd because even I don\u2019t bother my friends that frequently when either are in relationships because despite that, we respect boundaries and understand we have to seek professional help if needed at a point", "100%. He assumed?? Nope if you truly cared about your relationship you ensure she knows that boundary. What if she assumed that because he kept answering her calls he\u2019d be willing to leave his girlfriend for her?", "I had to look this up. Assuming he\u2019s in the US, here is their standard cell phone policy:\n\nhttps://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2019/pb22513/html/updt_002.htm\n\nHe cannot be on the cellphone and driving at the same time.\n\nSo unless he is delivering by foot for the entire 3-4 hours he\u2019s on the phone with her, someone can complain and he can get fired by talking on the phone while he\u2019s moving his truck, even if it isn\u2019t an in-depth conversation.", "Depends on the friend, and what you mean by support. \n\nAt certain periods of my life, I've spent more time with some of my friends then my family, because they were really struggling, and they needed me.\n\nI work more than 50 hours a week now, so my ability to support my friends is more over the phone/text/messenger atm. \n\nBut if my friends REALLY needed me?  I'd be there.", "its a huge amount of time, which makes it much sketchier that he never brought it up with his gf (bc its cutting out a huge amount of his day) - but like, everyone's friendships are different and that alone would be fine if his girlfriend actually knew about it (and the extent of it) and it wasn't taking away time from their relationship and intimacy", "I mean talking to anyone that long that regularly seems like red flag. Even if it truly stayed completely platonic, this could get tiring in a relationship. I mean talking to someone hours everyday sounds like co-dependency and would make someone wonder if they\u2019d truly have time and emotional capacity for you. And I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to think two people who are attracted to the opposite sex could develop feelings after talking that much. Especially with this being new in recents months, not a previously established best friend that he had and regularly talked to when his girlfriend first came in the picture.", "It iS pLatonIC! lol"]}
