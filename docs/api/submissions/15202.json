However even if the relationship was super short and there may be more going on, you can\u2019t rush someone\u2019s hurt. So continue to be kind.\n\nI do want to add that being kind does not mean the you have to allow yourself to be mentally drained from her for days on end. It\u2019s okay to be kind and also give yourself some space", "NTA. I think such a severe reaction to such a short relationship does require someone to talk to. Especially if they\u2019re losing it like you said they are. They\u2019re  reacting as if their fianc\u00e9 died on their wedding day.", "NTA and you may even have done some good with this attempt to instill a bit of perspective, but don't expect her to take it well in the short term.", "NTA. If you truly approached this with kindness and support. I\u2019m not sure that you didn\u2019t do this because you are annoyed. I hope you did it purely for her but I have my doubts.", "NTA. \n\nHealing does have a timeline. She sounds clinically depressed and she may be pregnant. You gave her very good advice. You are a good friend and hopefully when she pulls out of this she will see that.", "I reacted the same way after a WEEK long relationship, after some situationships, two months long relationship etc..yeah she needs to see someone, it's not normal, in my case I needed serious help (I was already in therapy tho). \nI started taking antidepressants after a while of this shit.\nNTA but be gentle and caring if you have the mental energy to do so \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nWhen people are having emotions, and those emotions are so strong they can't navigate them, and they make those emotions everyone else's problem with no desire to get help, then you have a right to speak your mind when they are using you for an emotional support floatie. \nhttps://youtu.be/xuue-s8qM8w", "NTA. I initially thought differently based on the title alone, but unless you were indelicate with how you talked to her, I think you did everything right here except qualifying with the \u201cif a short relationship.\u201d Ideally it would be \u201cif you\u2019ve been feeling this way for this long\u201d rather than trying to assign normalcy based on relationship length. But this is understandable and hard to get right in the moment (because it\u2019s factually true that it\u2019s more worrisome here because the relationship was short; it\u2019s just not a helpful detail to include when speaking to her at this point).\n\nYou provided unconditional support in the short to medium term. You recognized when the behavior went from expected to concerning. You approached the conversation with empathy and framed the help as something that was warranted (rather than insultingly). Now, we can\u2019t control how your friend feels about hearing that advice, especially because it sounds like they harbor some negative associations with professional mental healthcare. All yon can do is be supportive and give all you can up until the limits of your own well-being. This might require taking a step back if your friend doesn\u2019t accept the advice and you aren\u2019t able to deal with her symptoms as intimately as you have so far.", "NTA, but at this point, you kinda have to deal with it. If you completely cold shoulder her because you\u2019re annoyed with her melodramatic response, living together could become really awkward and your friendship could end. If you have no emotional or mental bandwidth to deal with her bs though, it\u2019s can be hard. In your shoes (i\u2019m the same age) i\u2019d ignore her when she talks about the relationship/him. Engage her when it\u2019s about other things, but not about him. Tell her you don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. Do not get her comfort food, or do her laundry, or pick up after her, or go let her cry on your shoulder, she seems like the type that likes to get attention from minor sadnesses/pitfalls and will feed off of it. Good luck.", "NTA. This is ridiculous. 2 days official and she's acting like this? This some severe attachment issues.", "If you had actually said 'move on I would say YTA. Yiu don't get to limit someone else's emotions. However, suggesting she talk to someone because their response is disproportionate plays differently to me. Maybe because I think everyone nowadays would benefit from a neutral therapist to talk to.\n\nThat's beside the point. Ok, you can't tell someone to move on, but you can pull back your involvement if it is too much for your emotional wellbeing. This is why I am big on therapists. Many people stop talking to their support group when they think they are annoying their friends even if they really need more time to process. It's best of they process and therapists have to listen, and can delve deeper if the problem is deeper than what you think it is.", "YTA. When my partner broke up with me after a month being together, I felt like I was going to die. I was severely depressed for a week until we got back together. And we've been together for 20 years now this year. Just because it was a short relationship, doesn't mean it wasn't serious or meaningless. You don't have to continue to coddle her but you don't need to expect her to be over it because you think she should.", "NTA\n\nYou are helping her by indicating that she would benefit from professional help. If she\u2019s offended by this, it is an issue she needs to address.", "Soft YTA. The way you explained this relationship in comments is that it wasn't merely two days she knew this person and that changes the landscape. Who knows what they discussed or bonded over while she was on her trip. Even if there wasn't a physical presence for that time, it's entirely possible that she developed an emotional attachment. Perhaps it was too much for the guy when they got together and that was why it ended so abruptly after two days. I'm just spouting off there because we don't know why it didn't work out. \n\nRegardless, if you don't want to be her emotional support person, you don't have to be. You are well within your rights to tell her that you don't have the emotional bandwidth to help her through this, but I wouldn't bluntly tell her to seek therapy because even if you're right that she's got attachment issues or something along those lines, going on the offensive is less likely to make her want to listen to you.", "YTA. Put yourself in her shoes. How would you feel if she told you to move on? She is allowed to feel how she feels with no time limit. She will eventually feel better. She is grieving a relationship. Most people do not move through all five stages of grief within a few days. If you don't want to support her through it, that's your choice. You also are allowed to feel how you feel. Many people benefit from therapy. But, grieving for a few days doesn't mean she should seek immediate help.", "YTA. It\u2019s ok to be honest, but telling her she needs therapy is a bit too much", "YTA it\u2019s only been 2 days. I could maybe see that she would need some help if she was still sobbing a lot after 2 months or longer, but its very extreme to suggest therapy when she\u2019s only been sad for 2 days.", "How is affecting your relationship? She's not as fun. I'm sure she's heard of therapy, so if she didn't ask your advice, I could see where it wouldn't be well received. Did she ask you to sleep in her bed? You don't have to do extra favors for her but you also don't get to tell an adult how to deal with getting dumped. YTA even if you meant well.", "YTA.

With short relationships you don't. I don't think either one is necessarily easier or harder, it's all individual.

Honestly, I was pretty horrified to read that she demanded you sleep in her bed -- that's really unreasonable, in my opinion.\n\nYou've given her good advice regarding counseling. Now it's up to her. But stop letting her use you as an emotional dumping ground. When she starts sobbing uncontrollably or venting to you, get up and go to your own room and shut the door.
