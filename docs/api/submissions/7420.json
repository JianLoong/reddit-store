The presale tickets for Taylor Swift\u2019s concert required a capital one credit card which I don\u2019t have but my husband does. He said yes and gave me his card info. I bought tickets that totaled to $1200 after all fees. He never asked me how much I spent and because I planned on paying the bill I didn\u2019t think it mattered how much I spent on the card. \n\nBefore the sale, I checked the limit on the card and it had a $0 balance with a significant credit limit. After purchasing the tickets, the  only thing on the credit card was the $1,200 I spent. Anyway, when he saw the bill, he was livid. He started saying I stole money from him and said I took all the credit for the Taylor swift tickets (even though it clearly said \u201cLove Mommy AND Daddy). He told our daughter I stole her Christmas gift, even though I reminded him he told me I could use it and even have text messages to prove it. He then demanded I pay him the entire $1200 in cash. I told him I\u2019d pay the bill NOT him. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why he reacted this way because we are in the financial position to purchase $1200 concert tickets (I\u2019m an RN and he\u2019s a secretary of a property management company) and I never asked him to pay for any of it. \n\nWe\u2019ve kept our finances completely separate for the most part and this is the only time I\u2019ve ever used his credit card to pay for a \u201cluxury\u201d and it was for our daughter! I realized I\u2019m clueless as far as how much money he makes and he\u2019s very secretive about his finances. For example he\u2019s demanding I pay him the $1200 in full and in cash instead of letting me see the bill and pay for it like normal people do.\n\nAITA for wanting a divorce because of this?", "created_utc": 1673802997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cp4vv/aita_for_buying_our_daughter_taylor_swift_tickets/", "score": 386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How did you access that information, and what's stopping you from going that route again?\n\nThis an A thru C conversation, and we're missing B.\n\nBut, I would agree that what he said to your daughter was highly inappropriate, as how he reacted towards you, assuming your details here are accurate.", "What's the rest of the story here?", "If he canceled the card, did he report the tickets as fraud? You may want to verify the tickets are valid. And preserve those text messages just in case. Screenshot them, and print them and put them in a safe location.

I wondering if he reported it as fraud, and that's why he wants to be paid back in cash.  Check to make sure the tix are still valid.\n\nI could understand him being mad about the amount, but even \\*I\\* knew that these were insanely priced tickets and i am not a concert person or a Taylor Swift fan.\n\nBut the cost isn't what he is mad about, he is mad that you stole money from him? When you were paying for it AND had permission to do so? Make it make sense!\n\nThe stupid ass comment to your kid was completely uncalled for, that was asshole extreme. Who puts their pissy pants problem on their child, no matter the age.  He has one foot out the door and looking for excuses to make it your fault.\n\nNTA.  Oh, and its not about the tickets.", "NtA.  It sounds like he's keeping score of who does what your your daughter. And stole? That's a very heavy word for this situation, and that he's this angry over this feels weird.

Feels like we\u2019re missing some info. \n\nBut since you intended (and hopefully still do) to pay for them, cost shouldn\u2019t matter.

Wow. NTA for the purchase but you two seem to have issues aside from that", "NTA. If he was concerned about the cost, he should have asked you how much it was going to be.

His irrational behavior is a sign that he's either an abusive husband or mentally ill.", "NTA, something else is going on here, especially if you don't have a clear view into his salary and financials. But you very clearly should have prepared him for the ridiculous cost, because I'm sure he was expecting something lower.\nHis response is really strange, so it just depends on whether you care enough to get to the bottom of it (and of he's willing to communicate) or if you've seen enough other red flags to know that this should mean separation. If he's willing to try therapy and you want to make things work, that seems like an appropriate suggestion. His response to that could seal the deal one way or another.", "NTA: split finances seem to be one of the most common issues we see here.  Marriage is about coming together and doing things as a couple. Having completely separate finances leads to trust issues.", "NTA. Sounds really off and strange to me. Despite finances being separate, when you are married legally, you should still be fully transparent about each other's finances for two reasons.\n\n* What one of you do financially DOES impact the other, regardless if you comingle accounts or not.\n* If one of you fell ill or was hospitalized, the other may need full access to accounts and bills.\n\nI think you both need marriage counseling if you aren't divorcing, but I would be really concerned about why you can't see the statement and why that amount triggered him. I know for us that would be incredibly extravagant, but it doesn't sound like it was for you? You should also have full transparency on all finances if you are legally married.", "Not at all.", "Wow your husband is a drama illama. NTA", "Is he your husband or a loan shark?

I personally had zero idea that a concert could be that much until recently. I would probably also be like WTF if my wife spent that much on my credit card without giving me the head's up on price. For context we also have completely separate finances. \n\nI think that is above and beyond what should be paid for tickets to a show.

All this secrecy is not good for a marriage.", "Using that card wasn't an asshole move. Filing for divorce over  a single fight, even one in which your spouse is very wrong, seems like a big deal.", "NTA Does he overreact like this to other situations? If so, a divorce should be considered. If you just pay the credit card bill directly, he's squared away and there is zero impact to him. Don't understand what having the cash does for him.", "NTA but I don\u2019t really understand how married couples can easily separate finances.

Pay it off monthly and tell him since it was soooo important that he get credit for the gift he also gets to pay half.", "ESH. If your finances are primarily kept separate (btw - red flag that you're married and have no idea how much he makes), then you needed to communicate how much you were going to spend on the tickets, how much of that he was responsible for, and what your plan was for repaying his credit card balance. He also should have asked for these details before allowing you to use his credit card. Poor communication from both sides.", "YTA for not disclosing how much it would be.

Time to get a lawyer and perhaps a forensic accountant. \n\nHe sold property at the highest market point in recent times, and told you there was no profit?", "Did he forge your signature?

This is so strange. Is he having a breakdown or is he always like this? Please protect yourself.  Nta", "In most places in the US, you can look online at the county auditor or county recorder's website and do a property search. It's typically free and totally anonymous.

Letting your partner snoop at your phone and install a tracking app?  Or just talking to them about their day?  \n\nTrust is the belief that the other person has you in their innermost circle.  Its a leap of faith.  How you deal with finances isn't related.  \n\nIf you have shared finances, but only one person is has access, is that trust?  is that a successful marriage?  \n\nOne of the things couples will often do is set aside \"personal\" money for each side.

I just skimmed OPs comment history and didn't find it.\n\nBut yeah, something iS VERY fishy here", "Did he report it stolen and the ticket purchase as fraudulent?

It's like he doesn't want you to know what he spends money on", "That's a really odd one. My oh and I were on our way to get groceries the other day and I asked him \"what did you say you're on now since the pay rise?\" And he just told me there and then, not as a brag or anything (he's on 4* what I'm on) but because it's normal to have that general ball park figure of your significant other's income if you're in a serious relationship.", "Followed by a forensic accountant.", "From what he\u2019s told me, he purchased the duplex (a fixer upper) in cash.

Use the old credit card info you have and actually speak to a person.\n\nIf they say that charge was disputed then you know your husband is committing credit card fraud and apparently trying to pin it on you if it is discovered.
