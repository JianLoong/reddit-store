While you're entitled to your feelings, it's important to consider your husband's relationship with his parents and his desire to have them stay. Family visits can be important for maintaining connections, and your husband's wishes should also be taken into account.

Communication and compromise are essential in handling such situations respectfully.", "YTA. Your in-laws will only stay for 3 days.

I don't want hair products, oils and sweat on my couch that I'm going to sit on! \n\nBut, your parents stayed a super long time. Just because they're younger and practically friends with you doesn't mean you get to judge his parents by their ages and weight, who are only staying 3 days. \n\nDon't worry about what they think of your city, trans people, religious beliefs or whatever. Let your husband rein them in if anything happens. You just be nice and hospitable to them.", "Grow up. \n\nYour husband might have felt the same thing about your parents and didn't say anything so you shouldn't either.

I would not want Christian Conservatives in my home either.   I know that sounds awful!  It would be harder than hell.

You should put up with it with a smile, and do a better job of getting to know them while in the process.
