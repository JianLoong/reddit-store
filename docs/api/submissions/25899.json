It shouldn\u2019t be considered normal", "If they\u2019re so easy going why don\u2019t you have better, basic manners? A kind heart? A sense of courtesy to people who are\u2026large and different from you! You say they will freak out at a trans person. Who\u2019s freaking out about being with someone different? That would be you.", "Matter of opinion from a biased person.", "You can't bear them for 3 days?? Not even for your husband?? Like 3 fucking days. If he so much want to distance himself from them, why he himself is not telling to not come?", "No they\u2019re really fundamentalist. Homeschooled their children. Pro life. Pro guns. Love Trump etc", "the same way its his apartment, hopefully he never lets your parents stay over again.", "\u201cUnfortunately dear there\u2019s some overtime at work needed I\u2019m working 10-10 this week\u201d (precedes to leave early every morning to go to Panera to get a croissant, coffee and read for 4 hours)", "Maybe OP is going to stop contacting her parents if they get a bit chubby in their 60s.", "Or will OP refuse to look themselves in the mirror once they hit 50? Maybe they are planning to go to Dignitas at that point.", "it\u2019s true", "She finds the inlaws aestheticly disturbing.", "An Ikea bed can take the weight of 300 KG AS well.", "They are pretty great no parents are perfect but im just saying we have a good relationship which I value", "Well I\u2019m from germany so it ain\u2019t normal to me either but I\u2019m fine with it. There are many great things about this country and every country has problems so", "I\u2018m autistic maybe that\u2019s why", "I don\u2019t know he wants them to see the apartment and show them the city isn\u2019t as bad", "They are not coming to ask for your vote. They want to visit their son and his family. But you have \"friends\" for parents so you won't know how family works.", "Will it be hard to have them visit, especially as your political/societal views seem to differ vastly? Probably.\n\nBut, as all the commenters have reiterated, it\u2018s only for three days.\n\nAnd remember, you will most likely have these people in your life to some extent for years to come. So better to put on a brave face and deal with it than to burn bridges now. Not saying you shouldn\u2018t set boundaries if they say anything racist/homophobic, but show them common courtesy and hospitality.", "Good idea lmao", "OP will be the old person trying to be hip lol.\n\nTrying to hang with the youth", "You sound very German (read: you sound like an asshole)", "So what happened to you. How did they fail with you.", "Oh yes I agree that every country has problems but I don\u2019t think we should ever be \u201cfine\u201d with violence and being put in danger. I have children and it is something I would never want them to learn. I will put myself in danger to fight that sort of attitude to violence. I want the world to be good for my kids not have them fearing they could get shot walking down the streets", "Oh please. Too much Big Bang Theory. \nAsshole and autistic are not the same.", "Then why can't you do this for you husband? When he did that for 2 weeks for you? Why can't just be \"not hating\" for 3 days? And did you convey it to him that you don't like it? If yes, what did he say??", "Lmao what parents can be your friends and I make jokes with mine and have a good relationship with them. Doesn\u2019t have to be so strict and stuck up", "I hate people visiting it\u2019s the worst thing ever to me", "Omg not all germans are assholes lmao", "Bro idk I literally have asperger i don\u2019t have empathy i never want people over I hate it it\u2019s the worst. I need everything clean. I hate socializing", "I mean I lived here over a year and have never been in danger or was scared. I walk at night alone. I often drive home late from work. I go to weird parts of town to get some food at night. It\u2019s really not that bad. I go grocery shopping, theater, restaurants etc.", "Too much big bang theory? What i\u2019m literally diagnosed but this is reddit whateverr", "You are the one that is Stuck-up here and many more things as others have very eloquently pointed out.", "But it was ok for your parents, right?!\n\nSo get over yourself and agree with your in-laws visit, not for their sake but for your husband\u2018s sake. What\u2018s fair for you should be fair for him. Especially as your parents were there for 14 days and his only want to come for 3.", "Thwn what's your excuse?", "You're in a marriage and part of marriage is compromise. It can't be one rule for you and another for your husband. It isn't fair on him.", "I think you are mixing up sociopathy and aspergers.", "Autistic here. Lack of empathy is a symptom of psychopathy, not autism. Also: the fact that you are concerned about what they might say about seeing a trans person who you do not know (i.e. you are worried about a stranger's feelings) is kinda evidence against your claim that you do not have empathy.", "If there is random shootings on the streets it IS  that bad. Things like that put everyone in danger whether they feel it or not. I\u2019ve got no problems with you living your life no matter the danger. Everyone should but for stuff like that to be normal is sad. Random violence is something that we as humans should be fighting against for the freedom of all human beings not living with it because it is normal to us", "I mean it might be funny to have them here because when my parents were here there was a drive by shooting at 3 am my whole lobby got shot up and windows were shattered. So if a shooting happens when they\u2019re here they might not wanna come anymore lol", "I dont think I wanna let them come idk man im kinda in between.", "Well my parents only come once a year", "What are you even trying to prove? Are you that consumed by your hatred for ILs?\nPeople like you should not marry.", "and now they won't come over ever! congrats.", "People like me shouldn\u2019t marry? Lmao wtf I just don\u2019t wanna hang with his conservatives fundamentalists christian family sorry I guess. I hate having people over not just them. Even his friends. Can\u2019t stand it. Always hated it", "But you love having your own parents. You're just digging yourself in deeper."]}
