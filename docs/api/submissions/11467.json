But, you were being hit on all the time and that would be annoying.   And they insisted you were homophobic for not liking being hit on all the time.\n\nSo, it's perfectly reasonable to go to a female gay bar.  And, you made new friends.  Yet **they** were uncomfortable being hit on.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like the best answer here is for the group to split up, with the women going to the male gay bar and the men going to the female gay bar.  Everyone wins.  Friend groups don't have to hang out as a single unit all the time.\n\nBut, at this point, the girls are being the AHs, particularly because they labeled you homophobic for not wanting to be hit on all the time.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like they just wanted to go to a gay bar to avoid flirtation.\n\nWhen it\u2019s flipped on them, they get really uncomfortable.\n\nThey\u2019re seriously the implicitly homophobic ones because the only reason they are around those gay people is to avoid flirtation, not to have a good time in a place that just happens to mainly host gay people.\n\nPlus, what the hell do they expect when they go to a bar? For people to NOT flirt? All they have to do is decline. Most people have enough sense to take the hint and if you leave your drink unattended, just order a new one.\n\nAlso, lesbians tend to be some of the nicest and least entitled people out there. So they\u2019re really good to hang around with, so glad to see you\u2019ve made friends there.", "NTA, most gay bars do not particularly want giant groups of straight women there every week anyway.

But I think you are missing one point. Three types of bars - straight, gay and lesbian. In 2 of the 3, the girls get hit upon. In 1 of the 3, you do. A lot of the girls you drink with likely have experience being groped in straight bars and find the experience in the gay bars liberating.\n\nBut they were wrong to disregard the harassment and groping you got. You are meant to be friends and they shouldnt have laughed about it. Think you need to sit down, be honest about the experiences on all sides and consider rotating. And help each other out more.\n\nEdit to add: the girls are AHs for trying to blame you for feeling uncomfortable by claiming you were homophobic. The lesbian bar should have been good reminder that you can not want to be groped simply because you aren't a piece of fresh meat.", "NTA, so it's fine for them to put you in awkward situations, but suddenly it's a problem when the same thing happens to them?

They subject you to sexual harassments so that they don't have to receive any and blame your discomfort on homophobia. I'm pretty sure NO ONE wants to be touched and hit on by anyone they aren't interested in, regardless of sexuality. Which is why the girls want to be at the gay bar in the first place!! Find new female friends...", "NTA.  That's very nearly heroic, in fact.\n\nMaybe I'm paranoid, but something seems a little more than off about their behavior.  I have to wonder if they're actively trying to get you to experiment.\n\nEDIT: Given all that's written, it seems to me less likely that you're homophobic than that they *fetishize* homosexuality.", "NTA.\n\nIt's unfortunate though that the girls in your group couldn't grasp that their discomfort was likely the same as what you and the other guys were feeling.

Maybe OP should talk with his female friends about how to handle things if they don\u2019t feel safe - set up some high signs when some dude is giving them grief so someone (male or female) can come intervene.  \n\nThese are things people usually do when they go out as a group - not decide to go to gay bars as a tit for tat.", "No it isn\u2019t lol it\u2019s a nod to the fact that there isn\u2019t a visible fire exit, which itself is a subversion of the \u201cexpected\u201d joke that you think he slowly realizes it\u2019s a lesbian bar, but he already knows it \n\nThe Simpsons classic era has a lot of these types of jokes. \u201cI\u2019m seeing double here, 4 Krustys!\u201d", "Cocoanut Grove would be a closer reference point", "I don\u2019t get this point about a ___ space there was and is so much protesting about letting women in traditionally male spaces, Boy Scouts, heck all bars used to be male only spaces (not that I\u2019m a fan of gender segregation) why is it ok for gay men only spaces or gay women only spaces doesn\u2019t that seem a step backwards?\n\n I just don\u2019t really get it. Shouldn\u2019t all businesses be available to all people no matter their race, ethnicity or sexual orientation. \n\nIm a het white guy trying to be supportive but I just don\u2019t get this. If you want a private club make it a private club, but if it is a bar open to the public it should be open to anyone.", "Don't know if if its pro or con, but I always remember: \"I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fuh-laming!\"", "If you insist.", "Wow, way to use a very extreme and specific example to make your point...", "Where do you live that this is the case? Are you in rural Florida or Texas or something?", "I've seen Unistatian, and I like it.", "It\u2019s typically used by people outside of north america to shit on \u201cUSians.\u201d Veeeeery few people in canada or mexico care.", "Not commenting at all about \u2018straight bars\u2019 or whatever just happened to see this your comment and had to say I have actually been to a bar with pretty much exactly the same message on their front entrance door, didn\u2019t use the word \u201cwoke\u201d but mentioned pronouns and guns and even a good ole \u201cf*** biden\u201d - unfortunately places like these do actually exist lol. Though I will add that this bar is in quite a small town, one of those where everyone knows each other and essentially everyone is on the extreme side of being conservative- certainly wouldn\u2019t expect to see anything like that in the city I live in (Seattle)"]}
