Your female friends are just hypocrites. Excellent way to prove it to them.", "NTA\n\nThis is a crystal clear case of \"What's good for the goose is good for the gander.\"  \n\nI assume they wanted to go to male gay bars because they feel more comfortable (i.e. not being hit on all the time).  But, you were being hit on all the time and that would be annoying.   And they insisted you were homophobic for not liking being hit on all the time.\n\nSo, it's perfectly reasonable to go to a female gay bar.  And, you made new friends.  Yet **they** were uncomfortable being hit on.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like the best answer here is for the group to split up, with the women going to the male gay bar and the men going to the female gay bar.  Everyone wins.  Friend groups don't have to hang out as a single unit all the time.\n\nBut, at this point, the girls are being the AHs, particularly because they labeled you homophobic for not wanting to be hit on all the time.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like they just wanted to go to a gay bar to avoid flirtation.\n\nWhen it\u2019s flipped on them, they get really uncomfortable.\n\nThey\u2019re seriously the implicitly homophobic ones because the only reason they are around those gay people is to avoid flirtation, not to have a good time in a place that just happens to mainly host gay people.\n\nPlus, what the hell do they expect when they go to a bar? For people to NOT flirt? All they have to do is decline. Most people have enough sense to take the hint and if you leave your drink unattended, just order a new one.\n\nAlso, lesbians tend to be some of the nicest and least entitled people out there. So they\u2019re really good to hang around with, so glad to see you\u2019ve made friends there.", "NTA, most gay bars do not particularly want giant groups of straight women there every week anyway. It\u2019s very tiresome when straight women get all excited and fetishistic about gay men but are homophobic towards lesbians.", "Nta", "Lesbian bars aren\u2019t for you, stay the fuck out", "NTA but you guys should really stop going to gay/lesbian bars. generally people go to these bars to meet people, and it kinda sucks accidentally hitting on someone who isnt interested because they\u2019re straight. you might technically be welcome but it really just seems like you\u2019re using them which is lame.", "NTA. I guarantee part of the allure of gay bars for these friends is a nice dance and drinks atmosphere without as many guys hitting on them, and they're completely failing to understand that it is sometimes different for you.", "NTA", "NTA. But I think you are missing one point. Three types of bars - straight, gay and lesbian. In 2 of the 3, the girls get hit upon. In 1 of the 3, you do. A lot of the girls you drink with likely have experience being groped in straight bars and find the experience in the gay bars liberating.\n\nBut they were wrong to disregard the harassment and groping you got. You are meant to be friends and they shouldnt have laughed about it. Think you need to sit down, be honest about the experiences on all sides and consider rotating. And help each other out more.\n\nEdit to add: the girls are AHs for trying to blame you for feeling uncomfortable by claiming you were homophobic. The lesbian bar should have been good reminder that you can not want to be groped simply because you aren't a piece of fresh meat.", "NTA, so it's fine for them to put you in awkward situations, but suddenly it's a problem when the same thing happens to them? And they have the nerve to accuse YOU of being homophobic? Nah, they're all hypocrites, stick to your alright guy friends.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFair is fair after all.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like your female friends only think about their own comfort level at any given time they are out with you. They subject you to sexual harassments so that they don't have to receive any and blame your discomfort on homophobia. I'm pretty sure NO ONE wants to be touched and hit on by anyone they aren't interested in, regardless of sexuality. Which is why the girls want to be at the gay bar in the first place!! Find new female friends...", "NTA.  That's very nearly heroic, in fact.\n\nMaybe I'm paranoid, but something seems a little more than off about their behavior.  I have to wonder if they're actively trying to get you to experiment.\n\nEDIT: Given all that's written, it seems to me less likely that you're homophobic than that they *fetishize* homosexuality.", "NTA.\n\nIt's unfortunate though that the girls in your group couldn't grasp that their discomfort was likely the same as what you and the other guys were feeling. Hopefully, your group can work something out. I'm happy that you were able to make some new friends though.", "Nta. It is hypocritical. However, they also might be looking for a safe space to drink without getting hit on. They need to be honest and communicate that, tho", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've heard it before that women prefer gay bars for that very reason. Have you ever asked them why they prefer it there?  \nLike sit and have an actual convo and see if there is an issue they're trying to avoid, and then if there is, try and be more proactive in bars in general about making sure everyone is safe and comfortable?", "NTA \n\nIf they can do it to you, why not do it to them", "NTA at all. I\u2019d suggest maybe you guys are not all that comparable to be particularly close friends and need to start doing things separately.

These folks seem odd to me. Just find a bar that's their speed.", "Enjoy your death trap, ladies!", "Why doesn't the friend group just split up so the women go drinking at the male gay bar and the men go drinking at the female gay bar?  Sounds like a win-win to me.", "It\u2019s pretty much a matter of the guys being bothered on a bigger scale, but the girls being uncomfortable at well-behaved flirting, then play victim.", "Or they can compromise and agree to take care of each other at ANY bar they are at... why split up when this is a friends outing", "like, look, i get it, it\u2019s exhausting being a woman in society. that doesn\u2019t give you the right to abuse one group\u2019s space to take advantage of their (stereotypical i might add; are there no bi men at gay bars?) lack of interest **while simultaneously** being offended in a similar space with the gender roles reversed.", "I was basing this on how the women behaved at the male gay bar. In other words \"We won't do a thing to look out for you\"  \n\nMaybe I'm cynical but I assume if they haven't bothered to yet, they're not going to start doing so.  And for all I know, maybe the men didn't do that either for the women in the group.", ">stereotypical i might add; are there no bi men at gay bars?\n\nHell, last time I went bar hopping with a group of friends, we ended up at a gay bar that had a drag show going on. I was with my gf (who suggested it) and 2 also straight friends. We had a blast. One of my friends even tipped several dancers while it was going on. Ended up staying there until we were ready to head home."]}
