Your female friends are just hypocrites. Excellent way to prove it to them.", "NTA\n\nThis is a crystal clear case of \"What's good for the goose is good for the gander.\"  \n\nI assume they wanted to go to male gay bars because they feel more comfortable (i.e. not being hit on all the time).  But, you were being hit on all the time and that would be annoying.   And they insisted you were homophobic for not liking being hit on all the time.\n\nSo, it's perfectly reasonable to go to a female gay bar.  And, you made new friends.  Yet **they** were uncomfortable being hit on.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like the best answer here is for the group to split up, with the women going to the male gay bar and the men going to the female gay bar.  Everyone wins.  Friend groups don't have to hang out as a single unit all the time.\n\nBut, at this point, the girls are being the AHs, particularly because they labeled you homophobic for not wanting to be hit on all the time.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like they just wanted to go to a gay bar to avoid flirtation.\n\nWhen it\u2019s flipped on them, they get really uncomfortable.\n\nThey\u2019re seriously the implicitly homophobic ones because the only reason they are around those gay people is to avoid flirtation, not to have a good time in a place that just happens to mainly host gay people.\n\nPlus, what the hell do they expect when they go to a bar? For people to NOT flirt? All they have to do is decline. Most people have enough sense to take the hint and if you leave your drink unattended, just order a new one.\n\nAlso, lesbians tend to be some of the nicest and least entitled people out there. So they\u2019re really good to hang around with, so glad to see you\u2019ve made friends there.", "NTA, most gay bars do not particularly want giant groups of straight women there every week anyway.

I guarantee part of the allure of gay bars for these friends is a nice dance and drinks atmosphere without as many guys hitting on them, and they're completely failing to understand that it is sometimes different for you.", "NTA", "NTA. But I think you are missing one point. Three types of bars - straight, gay and lesbian. In 2 of the 3, the girls get hit upon. In 1 of the 3, you do. A lot of the girls you drink with likely have experience being groped in straight bars and find the experience in the gay bars liberating.\n\nBut they were wrong to disregard the harassment and groping you got. You are meant to be friends and they shouldnt have laughed about it. Think you need to sit down, be honest about the experiences on all sides and consider rotating. And help each other out more.\n\nEdit to add: the girls are AHs for trying to blame you for feeling uncomfortable by claiming you were homophobic. The lesbian bar should have been good reminder that you can not want to be groped simply because you aren't a piece of fresh meat.", "NTA, so it's fine for them to put you in awkward situations, but suddenly it's a problem when the same thing happens to them? And they have the nerve to accuse YOU of being homophobic? Nah, they're all hypocrites, stick to your alright guy friends.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFair is fair after all.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like your female friends only think about their own comfort level at any given time they are out with you. They subject you to sexual harassments so that they don't have to receive any and blame your discomfort on homophobia. I'm pretty sure NO ONE wants to be touched and hit on by anyone they aren't interested in, regardless of sexuality. Which is why the girls want to be at the gay bar in the first place!! Find new female friends...", "NTA.  That's very nearly heroic, in fact.\n\nMaybe I'm paranoid, but something seems a little more than off about their behavior.  I have to wonder if they're actively trying to get you to experiment.\n\nEDIT: Given all that's written, it seems to me less likely that you're homophobic than that they *fetishize* homosexuality.", "NTA.\n\nIt's unfortunate though that the girls in your group couldn't grasp that their discomfort was likely the same as what you and the other guys were feeling. Hopefully, your group can work something out. I'm happy that you were able to make some new friends though.", "Nta. It is hypocritical.
