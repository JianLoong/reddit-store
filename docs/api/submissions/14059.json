It was left on the table, and my partner was the reason we didn't put him in the crate.\n\nPartner thinks he should be better trained, and is annoyed that I'm blaming him instead of the dog. We had a small argument about it.\n\nEdit: This post isn't about the age gap and I'm tired of people making it out to be. I'm not overthinking this because he's manipulative or has groomed me.

My other wouldn\u2019t. Same training. Same level of care. Simply different personalities and breeds.", "Exactly!  A jar of peanut butter unattended and within easy reach is too much temptation.", "I have been graduated by the time we met. And again it was consensual and I was the one initiating it.  But I also always second guess myself. Which isn't an issue because of him. I was not sure on how I acted. Neither of us are actually upset with each other. It was one of those things that was just like okay let's see whose right. I'm still getting my dog training and I'm still going to make sure he doesn't do this again. But my relationship doesn't matter.", "Girl, our dog is perfect except for grabbing people food. She is stealthy and has zero limits. We haven\u2019t mastered the food issue other than not leaving anything out.", "Partner is right, *he* needs better training. Not the dog. NTA", "My dog is really good about not taking food that isn't his, I can literally leave him alone next to a plate of chicken (he loves chicken) and I think even he would fail a peanut butter test. NTA", "YTA\n\nYou know the dog is not properly trained, you now what he will do when left alone, and you do did not ensure he was kenneled, or counters cleared off. It is your responsibility to do this every time you leave. \n\nYou both left the house together, not him leaving after you, with the dog in your care, and then him leaving the dog or something to chew on out. If that were the case, then things would be different.\n\nUntil you have the dog fully trained, YOU need to make sure he is kenneled or the house is secured for him to be out.", "NTA\n\nPlenty of people crate train their dogs for this exact reason. Plus you are aware of your dogs lack of training and have taken steps to get him properly trained. If your bf is planning on living with this dog then he needs to get on board with its care routine.", "I don't think either of you are TA. I'm not an animal person. I like them well enough, I don't hate them, but they're not for me to keep. I really like other people's animals and if I go to someone's house with a cat chances are they're on my lap. My friends' dogs always want to play with me. Animals seem to love me. To me they are not a source of comfort, support or companionship. To me they do nothing but cost money and destroy things. I cannot provide the support for an animal and think it would be cruel for me to try and do so. My wife is not that way. She gets so much joy from them. I knew this when I met her and now our kids also feel this way as well. We have a cat and two dogs. I love my family and want to see them happy more than anything. It's more important to me than the messes I have to clean and the destroyed things I have to fix. However, there are times when I get resentful that this situation is entirely one sided. Sometimes the animals make me the opposite of happy. I know that I can't leave the peanut butter out and that it would be my fault for doing so, but why shouldn't I be able to in my own house? Why should I be the one to clean throw up for an animal I didn't ask for and didn't want? We've come to a balance on this. I'm not saying that this is the case for you (it may be since your BF didn't have an animal and it's yours), but if it's anywhere close to that you're going to have some talking to do. He's going to be angry at times like this and that's ok. With a dog it's probably going to get a lot worse than a jar of peanut butter and it's naive to think that it won't. God I wish it was only a jar of peanut butter.", "ESH here. Keep working on finding your dog a trainer and get those 2 month courses from Petco, Petsmart, or whatever equivalent you have near you. Your dog is now both of yours responsibility, but mostly yours.\n\nMy dog had the same destructive habits, and while he's since been trained, we go through a \"puppy proof\" routine if we leave him alone in the apt. If you don't make immediate changes, this habit could kill your dog. In an almost identical scenario, my partner left my dog's crate open when he left for work because he \"felt bad,\" even though the crate was part of his training. When I came home, my dog had thrown up *three socks* and I found a pair of my jeans destroyed (he'd somehow gotten into our hamper). I thought that was the extent of the carnage and like an idiot, didn't think to take him to the vet. Cut to the end of the week, he had an intestinal blockage, was vomiting fecal matter, and needed a $4.5k lifesaving surgery. He survived, thankfully. And I, too, refused to accept my responsibility for what happened because I had been diligent with crate training. At the point this happened, my dog had already been through 2 or 3 of those courses, and *to this day* (6 years later) he still likes to sneakily eat garbage, but we're way more vigilant with him now.\n\n\nNot saying any of this to scare you, but you need to TRAIN. THAT. DOG", "But why did OP not put the dog up this time? Both her and her bf left, how is he the reason the dog was not put up? \n\nAnd as you said, the bad training is the fault of the owner, not the dog. OP is the owner. She should be making sure the dog is kenneled or if left out, counters are cleared.", "OP left the house with the bf. Why did she not put the dog up? or clear the counters? She did not follow the routine.", "I agree with this to a point but the bf left out the peanut butter and argued to convince OP to leave the dog uncrated. If he\u2019s frustrated with anyone it should be himself.", "FYI, our vet recommends crating dogs when they are left home alone. Or at the very least confining them to a pet proofed room. The vet sees the results when things go wrong.", "In some ways this is worse. You really want to be careful about keeping him from eating something (like bits of plastic) that could damage his intestines. Food lids aren\u2019t designed to be dog toys and can break apart in bigger, sharper chunks. You\u2019re right to crate him when you\u2019re out.", "He\u2019s the one that left out the pb AND the dog. OP wanted to crate the dog, bf disagreed.", "I know.  She already answered this.  \n\nLeaving the PB out is more the issue than leaving the dog out the crate.  Most dogs will just chill out when left alone for a short while, but you never set them up for failure by leaving stuff like that out.", "Ignore them. I used to get it all the time when I was younger with my husband. Now suddenly we're 39 and 45 its fine \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 we've been together for over 23 years.

This post is about a conflict In your relationship so it does matter.", "No it doesn't. I'm not getting manipulated over my dog eating his peanut butter.", "You\u2019re being guilted by him, and blamed for a situation that he created by every possible definition. \n\nYou are a person in a highly vulnerable situation. It doesn\u2019t sound like you have a lot of outside friends, you left your family home and your religion, so your social structures are somewhat fractured, and you moved in with someone that you\u2019ve been with less than 8 months because you had no other options. Then this person, who presumably is paying for most if not all of your accommodations is blaming you for decisions that he made. Do you have anyone in your life that you trust to advocate just for you? Are you seeing a therapist of any kind? Probably a good idea given the family situation and it could provide a neutral, unbiased perspective on issues like this", "My well trained dog would totally attack a peanut butter container left on a coffee table while alone.\n\nIn no world was this not your BF problem for:\n\nA/ failing to crate the dog before leaving\n\nB/ not putting away food and leaving it out", "NTA. As I tell my husband, most dogs the intelligence of 2-5 year old, he is supposed to have the intelligence of a 56 year old human adult.

Who is worse trained, the dog or the man?", "Also, PB left out is potentially dangerous as if the dog ate enough, it could cause pancreatitis - caused by an excessive amount of fat ingested.

I recognise that she has got some not ideal teen behaviours but it\u2019s my job as her owner to make sure that when she\u2019s left alone there\u2019s nothing in her environment that she can destroy or get into that\u2019s going to hurt her.
