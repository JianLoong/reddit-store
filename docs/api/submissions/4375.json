You said your mom wouldn\u2019t have wanted to you to upset the other mourners. You disregarded that entirely because you wanted to do what you wanted to do. You made this about you. You said many family members left during your performance so clearly it wasn\u2019t received well. You for sure upset the other mourners which is exactly what your mom wouldn\u2019t have wanted by your own words", "Nah. OP put on a costume and alienated half of the mourning family and made them leave the service by acting outlandishly. For sure they made this about them because they said their mother wouldn\u2019t have wanted the other mourners upset", "Ok I\u2019m crying now, too. So beautiful.", "You're saying I was doing it for myself, but that's literally the opposite. I didn't think about how they'd react because I was so caught up on trying to do something my mom would have loved. I said that in the post, which you ignored to completely downplay what I was trying to do for my mom. And the fact that you purposefully ignored this to say the meanest thing possible mixed with your past comments seems like you just have an issue with who I am. You could take issue with the idea of it or agree with what my aunt said, but the fact that you stooped to saying that about me is what I'm insulted by.\n\nAfter taking time to process this (which has been so fucking hard with everything else on my plate), I think my mom would have understood. She had a very complicated relationship with her family because she refused to tone herself down or change herself for them. The people who loved her the most and were the closest to her, like my siblings and friends, stayed and loved it. I gave her a eulogy that showed who my mom was and who she loved and why everyone who loved her loved her so much. The people who had an issue with who she was in life still couldn't accept her, and I think she'd be upset with them and not me.", "The mothers closest family and friends were not upset, and were actually happy about it. They know what she would have wanted best. If other more distant relatives were upset because it didn\u2019t comport with their traditional views, that\u2019s on them. They clearly didn\u2019t support the mother\u2019s untraditional mannerisms and lifestyle anyway.

I don\u2019t know who you are so I\u2019m not sure how I could have an issue with you as we are all anonymous here. I stand by my saying you made your moms eulogy about you. You wanted to perform and you didn\u2019t give a toss how it made any of her family feel. You\u2019re ignoring the part where you say that your mother wouldn\u2019t have wanted other mourners upset. You upset them. You expressly went against her wishes about not making others upset because you wanted to play dress up. You even said \u201cI should have known Id get this reaction\u201d but you did it anyway because it\u2019s all about you", "According to OP, part of the mother\u2019s wishes was not upsetting other mourners. OP went against what mom wanted by making people leave the service and be upset while mourning. OP chose to perform even when they \u201cshould\u2019ve known\u201d it wouldn\u2019t be received well. So if OP upset the other mourners, I\u2019d say mother\u2019s wishes were not followed. OP followed OP\u2019s wishes", "Not harassment on a public post.

I don't know how to tell you it is not fun to be wearing and delivering a eulogy in drag. When your mom dies you go above and beyond to do something she would have wanted, that can even capture one tenth of her spirit. I didn't \"expressly go against\" any wishes, I just know she would have liked all of her family to gave gotten along at her funeral. But that was not on me. If they have a problem with who my mom was, that's them. You don't understand my mom at all or me, but you're literally making up stuff to have the worst possible understanding of this situation. I think you just have a problem with gender non-conformance. Again based on this and your other comments and that you feel the need to keep insulting me.", "Just dressing in drag doesn\u2019t mean that op \u201cperformed\u201d anything.

Makes sense.", "Half my family? My aunt and her husband stayed, she just made her sons leave, and my dad left who hurt my mom more than anyone else left. My grandparents stayed. Three people left, two of them who were told to. For those of us who loved my mom and were there with her when she was sick, it was gave us a chance to honour who she was. Stop claiming things I didn't put in the post. You don't know me but you seem to be obsessed with me, because you've clearly got your own issues.

You did the right thing, don't give the naysayers a first or second thought, what you did was personal for your mom, about your mom, and a loving tribute.", "NTA. Your mom. Your business. It sounds like a beautiful tribute and your siblings loved it. The others are focusing on the wrong thing.

That shit takes talent.", "I've read a few of your comments now and I think your mother would have been fine with it.  She didn't apologise for who she was and she didn't tone herself down, so she wouldn't have wanted or expected a boring funeral.", "She sounds amazing-- and it sounds like you got that spirit from her. It's beautiful to me that you gave her the send-off she would have wanted. Not everyone can understand that. Carrying on when a parent who you shared a strong relationship with goes too soon is so hard, and one of the hard things is delivering a eulogy, but yours honors the person she was-- her love, her light, her humor, her embracing of being a whole, weird, wonderful person instead  of fitting into  a box. And those are the parts of her that will live in you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeeply sorry to welcome you to the dead parent club, it's the worst club I've ever belonged in, but it sounds like you did her PROUD.
