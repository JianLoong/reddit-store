Maybe the brew-pub in Boerne, Texas (population 18,232) can get by with charging their limited audience higher prices. But restaurants in more competitive markets just can\u2019t do that unless everyone rises prices together and that\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon.\r  \nBut there was a much bigger problem: Meyer and others learned that eliminating tips hurt their employees.\r  \n\u201cThe numbers don\u2019t lie,\u201d David Stockwell, the owner of an Italian bistro in Brooklyn told the New York Times. \u201cWe thought it was the rare instance when a good business decision lined up with a good ethical decision. But we realized all the problems that came with the model started rearing their heads in our business.\u201d\r  \nStockwell\u2019s restaurant had opened tip-free in 2016 but then reintroduced tipping in 2018. Meyer ended his no-tip policies. So did many other high-profile eateries. They couldn\u2019t recruit people. They couldn\u2019t retain good workers.\"", "Servers are paid very low wages and depend on tips.

There was a level of service that I think warranted a 10 or 15% tip. Everyone knows how annoying it is to get home and realize your order is wrong.

If you order takeout from a place that is a busy restaurant, then they likely do very few takeout orders and it's usually the server bartender that happens to be available to take the call that rings it in and rings you out.

So in that scenario you're costing them their tips that are being given to them by their dine in customers, and interrupting their ability to serve their dine in guests. The \"takeaway\" I'd like to leave you with is to sus out if that is happening when you arrive. Anywhere that commonly does a lot of takeout (chinese, pizza, a place with a takeout window, self-seated) etc. do not tip, if it's a busy restaurant with servers and the bartender is ringing you up then they're 1. taking time away from likely their very busy duties to serve you which could impact other tables service and their tip, but 2. they will be tipping out on your meal cost to their other coworkers who helped prepare the meal/manage the restaurant).", "I shit you not, the 7-Eleven I stop at on the way to work for an energy drink and a burnt taquito has tip jars at the registers.
