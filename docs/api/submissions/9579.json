Maybe the brew-pub in Boerne, Texas (population 18,232) can get by with charging their limited audience higher prices. But restaurants in more competitive markets just can\u2019t do that unless everyone rises prices together and that\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon.\r  \nBut there was a much bigger problem: Meyer and others learned that eliminating tips hurt their employees.\r  \n\u201cThe numbers don\u2019t lie,\u201d David Stockwell, the owner of an Italian bistro in Brooklyn told the New York Times. \u201cWe thought it was the rare instance when a good business decision lined up with a good ethical decision. But we realized all the problems that came with the model started rearing their heads in our business.\u201d\r  \nStockwell\u2019s restaurant had opened tip-free in 2016 but then reintroduced tipping in 2018. Meyer ended his no-tip policies. So did many other high-profile eateries. They couldn\u2019t recruit people. They couldn\u2019t retain good workers.\"", "Servers are paid very low wages and depend on tips.

Then they keep track of to go orders to make sure the right ones go to the right customers.\n\nI don't think you need to tip the full amount on to go orders but an extra $1-$3 reflects the work they're doing to prepare your order. This is even more true when it's a place you order from regularly.", "You're not an ah, but just as an FYI, sales are tracked and a percentage of sales is assumed by the government to have been earned in tips.  That amount is automatically added to your wages and taxed, then subtracted again since it's assumed you were paid in cash.  This can either be on their paycheck or at the end of the year at tax time depending on what percentage of their tips are reported. \n\nWhat this boils down to is leaving zero tip actually costs servers money.  In my state it assumes 8% of sales is paid in tips.  Just under $1 for a $12 burger would keep your order from costing them money because they're being taxed on that dollar regardless.  It's not a lot of money it costs them, but it adds up.  And with Covid, more sales are to go.\n\nTipping culture sucks.  I wish it didn't exist.  But it does, and the government punishes the servers when people stiff them.", "ESH.  That employee shouldn\u2019t have directly confronted you about not tipping, it\u2019s unprofessional.  That said, in most sit-down retaurants (excluding fast food), it\u2019s usually the bartender and/or bar back, or sometimes the server who get stuck waiting on tables in the bar area who are assembling and packing orders, in addition to their other duties.  In cases like those, you suck for not tipping, even if it just $1-$2.", "I tip no matter what. If it\u2019s a local place where we have a good rapport and go often, I tip a lot. \n\nI\u2019m surprised people think you don\u2019t tip on takeout. It doesn\u2019t have to be 20%, but I think it\u2019s nice to add a little something for someone who is handling your meal.", "I always tip at least $1 for takeout, and often at least 10%, so **it would be reasonable for you to tip $1**. The reason is this: the minimum wage for servers less, and often laughable, so if everyone is getting takeout and don't tip, the servers often don't make enough money to pay their bills.  If you are in the U.S. it is an AH move to never tip, even if it's just take out.  I lived off tips for years and feel that if people don't have a budget to eat out at all, it's ok to not tip once in a while**.**  \n\nAlso, if the guy that was that salty to you prepares your food, I would not return to that place without tipping some.  His question suggests he's one of those AH who sabotage the food of customers they don't like. YTA.", "Obviously no tipping for takeout NTA", "You ask me for a tip and I'm never coming back", "NTA I feel like you don\u2019t tip for pick up. Honestly I\u2019ve stopped buying a lot of stuff for this exact reason. Tips are being expected for every little service now and it\u2019s getting too expensive so I just don\u2019t have the extras.", "I\u2019m so torn on this- I get restaurant staff are underpaid, but if it\u2019s takeout I don\u2019t feel obligated as a former restaurant worker. It\u2019s not about the food prep- that\u2019s the price of the food. The tip is for the service of a sit down restaurant.\n\nFuck US tipping culture. NTA.", "Reserving judgment because tipping culture fucking sucks but I will say that some server or busboy has to take a bit of time out to package the food for pickup so I will always throw down a dollar or two for the bit of time and effort to package up your stuff.", "Pickup?  Nope. NTA.", "NTA. There\u2019s nobody actually serving the food. Someone handing you a bag doesn\u2019t need a tip.", "People who take care of takeout are 95% of the time Hostesses\u2026 who make more than double what servers make. No tip needed", "YTA - everyone commenting N T A I\u2019m genuinely curious who you think packages the good, gets sauces, drinks, napkins, silverware. A host or server does these things.", "YTA it is WAY more work to box up a to go order and it costs the restaurant more money as well.", "This sounds hella made up. *a confrontational look in his eyes, hands are shaking, knees weak, hands are sweaty, mom's spaghetti*", "NTA. Lots of people tip 10% on take out since waiters have to wrap up the food, but you said that the payment system didn't even give you an option to tip. No reason for you to go to the bank and get cash just for them. If they want people to give them more money then they should update their system.", "I tip on takeout because I want to. Because I feel workers are underpaid (especially for the crap they have to put up with from customers). And because I'd rather the people handling my food weren't totally unmotivated in their jobs\n\nBut I don't think tipping should be expected on pickup orders.", "Honestly, I think it depends. If it's something simple that's just put in one bag, no. But if they've individually packaged stuff and included extras like condiments and plastic ware, that takes effort, so I usually leave a tip. Not my usual 20%, but at least 10%", ">So instead of their employer paying them actual livable wages, they are pressuring their customers to do that.\n\nActually not - the model is basically that the customers pay the worker's wages. So if you don't tip, the workers don't get paid. But even for workers who aren't paid $2.13 an hour, the actual minimum wage isn't a living wage either.\n\nSure, I'd rather go to restaurants that paid their workers a living wage. But it isn't easy to figure out which ones do.", "Do you tip the cart pusher at a store too? They make sure they get the carts from the parking lot, especially the ones not placed in the designated spots, and make sure they have them ready for your shopping experience. And on top of that, they do it under the hot sun.\n\nThey deserve tips more than online order preparers.", "You're basically saying everybody you come across when conducting business of any sort has to be tipped. At what point should people just get paid enough to do their job? Andb the businesses that don't just don't have employees?", "Since when is it customary to tip for take out?  It\u2019s nice and generous that some do but shouldn\u2019t be expected.", "I've always tipped on takeout. For a long time I wasn't sure if I should or shouldn't (I didn't grow up with US tipping culture). Eventually I decided it felt right given how low-paid food service workers are.", "This will probably get lost, but at my favorite spot; the servers pack up the to-go orders. Is it the same as full on service at a table? No. But I do my best to tip somewhere between a solid table service tip and no tip. It\u2019s not as if they\u2019re doing nothing me as the customer.", "Yes until food workers get paid a living wage I will tip", "I do too especially the last couple of years when people were struggling. It's usually wait staff who have to take time from their tables to pack up the order and run my card. There are a few small restaurants that are walk-up and are independent, and I want to support them, so I don't mind tipping. \n\nIf I'm just buying a donut or an ice cream, I don't always tip. I try if I have cash but I probably wouldn't if I was using a credit card.", "Just to be clear to anyone else reading,  not all states have a tipped minimum. For example,  in California, servers make at least $15.50/hr plus tips so they are doing better than retail workers or other minimum wage workers who don't get tipped. \n\nI personally made way more working food service than retail, stock, or even entry level office jobs.", "I tip them because I can afford it and I\u2019m not cheap. How they divide it is up to them.", "> cooks, they make good money\n\nlol\n\n> she makes $15 bucks an hour\n\nIs that...supposed to be an example of a lot?", "I used to do that at a buffet. The waitresses would get their tip and I'd ask for him by name and hand him money directly while he wiped sweat off his face", "Most takeout places I order from it is the chef bringing you your food, so I always tip on takeout", "exactly,  I do the same at many places that I know the person working takeout also is the one getting all my sauces, sides, and main order together and verified. I don't go the 20% min I would in sitting down at a  restaurant , but usually at least 15%", "Oooh it\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re doing, *checks notes* their job!", "I also leave a tip for takeout of at least 10%.", "you do understand that that kind if thinking is why they won't ever get a living wage.\n\nI respect where you are coming from, honestly. but restaurants that pay below min wage know exactly what they are doing.", "Do you tip at McDonalds?", "California has so many amazing laws/protections, lol, I'm so jealous", "Nice. In Tennessee it's $2.24/hr", "Average over the course of a paycheck, usually 2 weeks", "Chirpy - definition \"cheerful and lively\", we'll take that over Europe's \"morose and sullen\". That's why our servers make more  $ than most people. And bizarrely pushy, I think you're just not to use good, friendly service.", "That cook needs to find a better job", "They don't get paid $2.24/hour like restaurant servers though, do they?", "We pay a lot in taxes, but I do appreciate things like our employee protections. I was shocked when a friend in another state told me that rest breaks weren't mandated there.", "I hope that someday you guys will vote in better politicians and laws.", "maybe try and grasp the actual point i\u2019m making, which is that \u201cgood service\u201d is not an objective thing. \n\nthere are also places other that america and europe, just btw.", "Depends on the state.  In my state,  servers don't have a separate minimum wage.  It's all the same.", "My home state (don't worry, I don't live there anymore) has some of the worst employee protections in the country. Sometimes since moving I'll be talking to someone about some common workplace thing that happened, and they're like \"thats so illegal!!\" lol no. maybe for you, but no. XD\n\nPeople also rarely believe, but it's a fact, that federal minimum wage only applies to certain types of jobs.\n\nOr that it doesn't (in some places) apply to minors.\n\nThe whole system is insane, and a lot of times when people don't know what protections they have it's because they lived somewhere those protections don't even exist!", "You can argue the law and hypotheticals all you want, but people get screwed by their employers all the time this way. I certainly did when I waitressed in college. Lots of people working these jobs are single moms, college kids, etc. who either don't know their rights, or feel like they can't push their employer to make up the minimum wage because they could get fired and lose their job over it.", "Lol, good or bad service is obviously a personal judgement, which is the very definition objective", "Even tipped staff recieve federal minimum wage if the tips don't make up the difference otherwise.", "All this. I waitressed in college for $2.13/hour and there were plenty of slow shifts that I didn't make minimum wage. I could have fought my boss over it, but I needed that job so I sucked it up and hoped my next shift was better.", "no, personal judgement is inherently subjective. that\u2019s my point. YOUR definition of good service is exhausting and over the top to many people.", "Thanks for the fun debate, love talking to someone who keeps me thinking!", "You got me on that one, it is subjective! I just enjoy friendly service."]}
