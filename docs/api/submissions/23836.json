You clearly are indifferent to having children one way or the other. And people are making MANY assumptions about you and your life based on this. Like the birth control thing. They can at least wait until you confirm these things. EVEN THEN, Child free people are responsible for their own protection. There are a bunch of examples of people thinking they're sterile and then having children. Her being on birth control is to ensure her child free lifestyle is preserved, and that's her responsibility regardless of the sterility of her partner. The tubes tied thing is also about personal choice and empowerment. She wants to be childfree, by god, she's making SURE she's child free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me this reads like a food preference dilemma. You can eat italian food, or not. You don't actively crave it much. You've gone on dates to Italian restaurants before. No big deal. Your current partner HATES Italian food. Can't stand it. Refuses to go. You don't care about going, so neither of you eat Italian food.

So dumb, NTA.", "[deleted]", "NAH. It does matter that you didn\u2019t tell her the truth. She does have a right to be angry and you do need to learn the difference. Choosing not to have kids is just that. A choice it isn\u2019t just getting a vasectomy, it is knowing you don\u2019t want kids of any kind. You dating mothers mean that even though you are sterile (not a choice you made) you are ok with the idea of children. If something happens to your siblings would you want to take in the kids? Do you see how that would cross the mind of a childfree person? Your situation is not by choice and if you want to continue the relationship you would have to make a commitment to being child free not \u201caccept you fate\u201d. Good luck hope it all works out.", "NTA\n\nI'm not seeing what the issue is with the girlfriend or the people saying YTA. It would be a different situation if the girlfriend wanted children, and OP never told her he is sterile. While I can understand the girlfriend being somewhat upset in learning that info now, it's not like it changes their relationship fundamentally. For all intents and purposes, OP has an inconsequential medical condition not unlike having hypothyroidism, low blood sugar, or high blood pressure; things most people might question why they never knew but at the same time are not really justifiable reacting the way OP's girlfriend did. It's not like OP has terminal cancer, AIDs, or muscular dystrophy and didn't tell her. She didn't want kids anyways so it shouldn't matter as it doesn't affect any part of what either of them ultimately want out of the relationship.\n\nAlso, do we really know for a fact that OP's girlfriend hates being on birth control and not knowing she could have been off of it the whole time is a major factor in why she is upset? I think people are grasping at straws for calling him the asshole over that. If she really hated birth control, she has the option to go off it and make him wear condoms instead. There are also positive benefits to being on birth control even when not sexually active or with a partner who is sterile so to me it isn't clear that would be a major factor in her reaction either way. \n\nI also give OP leeway because the reason behind why he is child free is due to a poor decision that was made for him and there may be some trauma and emotional weight behind opening up about that to other people. With that in mind, I don't see how he is an asshole for having been potentially uncomfortable disclosing that to his partner when it has already been established that the partner doesn't want kids anyway.", "Why does everyone think he needs to give a rundown on his medical history?", "NTA\n\nThese comments about \"child free by choice and by circumstance are different\" are absolutely wild to me. Like, dude can't have kids, and won't be pushing them on her and disrupting her child free life, so there is literally no conflict. She doesn't want them and he can't have them. Seems like a match to me.\n\nIn terms of birth control and surgeries, while it is sort of weird that he never brought up his infertility, if she wants to be child free then it is her responsibility to ensure those things never happen. If she is in another relationship with someone who isn't sterile, she'll need all of those medical options. Also, you never know what may happen, and pregnancy can still happen against all odds. My nephew exists because of a pregnancy that medically never should have happened, but did. If she wants to ensure her child free lifestyle, the responsibility is on her.", "NTA. She doesn't want kids and you can't have them. Sounds like a good deal. Only issue is whether you change your mind down the line since you were exclusively nailing milfs beforehand which probably wasn't a good look to her. Idk man. Maybe you are TA.", "YTA for not disclosing this. Even though I'm sure it's not something that you think is that important (or lack of a better word); since you lived it your entire life.\n\nBut I think there is some discrepancy here......\n\nCause I don't think 'don't mind child or not,' is that much a difference versus 'child free.' You said you came to terms with never having children just through your life. But that is something that REALLY NEEDS to be properly discussed. Both of you need to lay out your stances on paper or some shit. Most arguments stem from the point that both people are arguing on different things.\n\nIMO it's completely semantics, and to me it's an unrealistic and unnecessary idealization to have a fuss. But still need to hear the other out; both of you.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't seem like this is a relevant thing to bring up, unless you've been having conversations specifically about birth control.\n\nHave the two of you been using condoms? Is she sterilized or is she on hormonal birth control? Does she have an IUD or something like that?\n\nHer decisions regarding birth control might be impacted by knowing that you're sterile or not.\n\nIt seems like she should have asked about what sort of options you might have been using for contraception if she wasn't satisfied with whatever she was doing though.\n\nOverall, the fact that you can't have kids should make you an ideal partner for her. No risk of a pregnancy scare even if whatever method she was using were to fail.\n\nHas she clarified why she's upset?", "NAH. You both agreed not to have kids in this relationship. I can see why she feels betrayed - this is a huge health thing and you probably should have told her when the conversation about kids came up. But I also don't think the omission outright makes you TA since you got into this relationship agreeing to be kid free. \n\nEveryone going on about birth control forgets the other stories on here about guys who were supposedly sterile having that one-in-a-million kid happen. If I were dating a man, even if he was declared sterile, I'd still be on some form of birth control unless I had absolute proof he had no sperm. (Then again the disphoria that happens when I even think about being pregnant is pretty bad so I may be an outlier.) \n\nYou're not an asshole, but I think in this instance you owe your girlfriend an honest conversation about this. Your past dating history is probably freaking her out now, and she might be worried you will change your mind about kids and leave her for another single mother or a woman willing to adopt. You need to make it clear that you are kid free, not because you can't have them, but because you don't want them and do want to be with her.", "If tomorrow you discovered you were not sterile (which given only 1/10 men experience a drop in sperm count period and it is rare for it to actually cause infertility) would you want kids? \n\n\nPersonally I'm childfree and it is not my hysterectomy that means I am childfree but my desire to not be a parent. If you would want to parent but can't because sterile... I'd agree with your gf, you aren't childfree but childless and that can cause problems for childfree people. \n\n\nSo soft YTA.", "YTA Probably a good thing you cant have kids.", "Your parents are such mega assholes I don't even know where to start.

Lots of people assuming that he has been taking bc... but he said nothing about it.  He did say something about a vasectomy though, although he didn't say he'd had one.\n\nWell.  This is reddit, where leaping to conclusions and adding details to stories is par for the course.", ">birth control SUCKS ASS\n\nFuckin oath it does, I literally cannot be on it because every time I try, even the ones that are supposedly non hormonal or low-side effects, it 100% always fucks me up for a long, long time both physically and mentally. To the point I can't hold down a job or anything because I get suicidally depressed every time.\n\nI get not everyone has it quite like that but there are still multiple side effects that many women have to suffer just so their man doesn't have to wrap it up. I'd be beyond pissed if I found out my bf conveniently hid that from me for 2 years.", "Especially depending on the kind. IUDs, for example? Literally hole punch the lady bits. I guess the male equivalent would be piercing the taint. Pills are a pain in the ass and cause so many hormonal things. The nexplanon does the same thing. I just switched mine, and it feels like constant stabbing in my sides, and my hormones make the BC unnecessary since I'm to sick to need it. Definitely TA if he never told her she didn't need that! \n\nLittle devils advocate moment though, sometimes docs do get that little infertility thing wrong. Still might want to get snipped JIC. But also still TA.", "They didn't make an assumption though... They asked an important question. The yta judgement is in place and explained separately. His answer just helps to decide how major of an AH he is or not.", "My guess would be that he told her \u201ei\u2018m sterile\u201c which she might interpret like he\u2018s had a vasectomy. If he told her he\u2018s had a vasectomy, i would go with Y T A because that obviously would have been a lie \ud83d\ude04", "Yes. But child free and deciding not to have children aren't.", "You encouraged her to get a pointless surgery? Jesus. YTA. I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t tell her..", "You\u2019re absolutely right. Big OOF", "Idk dude. My husband told me he was sterile but i continued taking birth control until i had a hysterectomy. There are so many stories from parents who claimed they couldn\u2019t have kids that i 100% take reproduction into my own hands. The *only* way i would believe a man who says he\u2019s sterile is if i am by his side while he gets tested and the doctor tells me there are zero sperm in his spooge.", "In all fairness, she should be getting her tubes tied because she wants to, not because she is forced to because her boyfriend refuses to get a vasectomy or use a condom.\n\nHormone changes are quite a bit to deal with by themselves, so it *MUST* be her choice.  \n\nAlthough she shouldn't, hormone changes can cause premature menopause, which isn't easy to deal with.  I'm sure there are other reasons; its Reddit and I'm not going to spend an hour to list them.", "yes and no, I feel like OP did not know about the in's and out of birth control for woman and it sounds like she wanted the surgery before she met OP too, plus how many time's do you hear story's about someone lying they can't have kids to baby trap or somehow they still got swimmers and were told they couldn't have kids by others.", "He probably should have brought it up, to be certain, but that's also something she might do just as a matter of peace of mind. After all, even if a guy says he's sterile, lots of women would likely choose to be cautious regardless.\n\nHow many mothers heard, \"I can't have kids, baby\" 9 months prior to proceedings?", "To be fair, she might want it done still if she was heavily in the child free mind set.", "Same here. I got pregnant all 3 times on BC - different types. And since they screwed me up so bad, I refuse to take them from here on out.", "No, it's worse. The perineum is outside and skin heals. The only closest description I can imagine is a shiv being pushed into the prostate, puncturing the guts. Because that's literally what a badly placed iud can do. Pierce the uterus. \n\nOP is a major AH.", "It's always impressive when OP becomes more and more of an AH the more they share", "She should have the choice, for sure.", "He never said he encouraged her, he never even said he didn't tell her he didn't have a vasectomy. Don't assume.", "And even then, lifestyle changes or pure chance might produce one lucky swimmer... unless someone has no ovaries/testicles, I'm not convinced.", "That\u2019s fair. But it\u2019s still a massive betrayal that he never even told her the truth and just let her think they saw eye to eye on this. \n\nYTA, OP.", "I was thinking that fertility/sterility is one of those areas where advice for people with completely opposite goals gets mixed together.\n\nLike a doctor might tell you you won't be able to have kids even though there's still a very small chance of you getting someone pregnant because they're thinking about it in terms of trying to conceive and not preventing pregnancy.", "It's not like he can sneakily get her pregnant or anything. If anything, he's definitely safer than someone who's child-free by choice. After all, someone else might make a mistake one day.", "Why does it matter if he is explicitly child free, or simply at terms with not being able to have children? Dating women with kids does not imply in any way that he is going to force kids on her. He's okay with not having kids", "   OP YTA.  In a conversation about being childfree in the relationship that leads to her saying (most likely saying something to the same effect)  \"maybe I should get a tubal ligation so WE don't have a kid by accident\" his response should have been \"Oh we don't have to worry about that, I'm sterile and cant have kids\" \n\nHe lied by omission. She would rightly assume he had a fully functioning reproductive system if he didn't saying anything to contradict that. likely he still uses condoms, and she as a person who doesn't want kids would probably be on birth control for safety's sake. \n\nYou can assume a lot with reasonable thinking. He let her potentially suffer side effects of a drug she didn't need, he was seemingly perfectly fine keeping his mouth shut while letting her get a surgery at great cost and risk to her health, as any surgery has risk. While he may not have encouraged her decision, he had plenty of opportunity to share a fact that made the surgery pointless.", "OP is also allowed to be fine with either set up. Fine if he dates someone with kids, fine if he dates someone without kids. They don't seem like a necessary part of his life, but he'll accept them if they're part of the deal.", "What if he leaves her for someone with kids one day though, because he\u2019s changed his mind and wants a bigger family after all? Or wants to adopt one day? Or do a surrogate type thing? Then she would be left high and dry. It happens. She deserved to know that he\u2019s not \u201cchildFREE\u201d, he\u2019s just sterile.", "To be fair, anyone may change their minds and start wanting kids. People change in relationships and that\u2019s a risk that everyone takes. He still should have told her for a myriad of reasons already discussed."]}
