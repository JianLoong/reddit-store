It\u2019s been two years, you needed to tell her the truth. Being child free and not being able to have kids are 2 totally different things.", "You asked for her point, here\u2019s how I would feel:\n\nThere is a massive difference between someone who doesn\u2019t want kids for whatever reason and someone who is unable to have them.\n\nIf those 2 collide, great.  But right now she may be feeling that you\u2019re not child free by choice but by circumstance.  And if it\u2019s just \u201cyour lot in life\u201d there may come a time when you decide you don\u2019t want to be childfree and will want to pursue expanding your family, something she doesn\u2019t want to do.\n\nIt\u2019s the basic motivation of why you\u2019re child free, because she doesn\u2019t know if your values would align if you weren\u2019t sterile due to your illness.\n\nCoupled with the fact that in 2 years together you didn\u2019t think to mention this she\u2019s feeling massively betrayed.\n\nLook, your life and experiences are your own, you\u2019re not obligated to share what you\u2019re not ready to share.  But now she has some doubt that you\u2019re not child free by will but rather by your sterility, you said yourself that you \u201cdon\u2019t know if you would have chosen to be child free.\u201d  It\u2019s okay to not know but even that uncertainty should have been shared with her.", "YTA. \n\nHas she been taking birth control with all its costs and side effects when it wasn\u2019t needed? Leaving her to do that unnecessarily would be a massive betrayal of trust. \nHave you had a conversation about kids in the future? Just because she doesn\u2019t have kids doesn\u2019t mean she never wants them. It sounds like you\u2019ve assumed that based on your lives currently. You could be changing her whole future without her ever knowing. If she\u2019d known at the beginning of your relationship kids weren\u2019t on the table she might not have invested in the relationship at all. \nWhy would you hide that? It seems quite profound and her finding out that way could feel like you don\u2019t trust her either. Imaging finding out something so important from someone so inconsequential in your life instead of from your significant other.", "YTA. Two years together, she should know these things about you. Also your parents are awful. Sorry about them.", "How would this have never been discussed if you're in a long term relationship? Even from the simple standpoint of not having to take birth control. Soft YTA, and your parents are def assholes", "I'm of the opinion that you need to disclose that bit of important information early on when you first start dating someone. So, yeah, YTA.", "It would be very helpful to know if she\u2019s been on birth control the whole time you\u2019ve been together", "I suspect that your GF is putting more weight on the \u201cusually dates women with kids\u201d comment than the \u201ccannot have children yourself\u201d comment. \n\nNAH in the sense that medical history can be a very personal thing, and I guess I can understand why you never felt like sharing it if you thought it would never be relevant enough to share. But from her perspective, it\u2019s a lie of omission, and a serious one at that. \n\nIf you want to pursue a long-term future with her, you should really think about couples therapy.", "YTA. Being sterile and not being able to have kids vs actively not wanting them is very different. And has she been on birth control this whole time? Wow wow wow", "YTA\n\nThat you dated women with children implement you are not against having children.\n\n\u201eChildfree\u201c is if you dont WANT children never ever.", "You not being transparent and truthful make you what? Come on", "YTA. \n\nbeing child free on purpose, and because of a medical reason, are two major differences.", "From a medical standpoint NTA. People have different feelings about sharing medical information. If OP is very private about his medical issues of any kind he is NTA. Only OP can decide when HE is comfortable sharing HIS personal health info. I would hope that eventually he would feel comfortable sharing with her. It is not necessary unless she wants kids then that should have been upfront information so as not to waste her time.", "Well you are child free but not by choice. That\u2019s a big difference. maybe she was considering to get married and have kids with you in the future. 2 years a pretty long time too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Remember how you had to get over it, because having that agency taken from you is cruel and unkind and you had to process that betrayal?\n\nRight, so you removed her agency by not being honest. Maybe she was on hormonal birth control (which is devastating to your body but no one cares, really), maybe she was considering a major surgery to avoid getting pregnant (both this and the prior one have a risk of death, which she can clear avoid by not doing those things), maybe she just had an idea of who you are and that idea is now based on half truths. So you would rather her engage in potentially very harmful behavior than have her know your truth? And regardless of the potential for harm from surgery or whatever, you stole her ability to make an informed decision about you and dating you for *years*. If I were her I\u2019d be questioning what else you withheld from me. \n\nAlso. Child free and sterile are not the same thing. Sorry your parents suck.

Why let her have surgery when you could just tell her you can't have children and let her make birth control decisions with all the information she needs?", "Which is an unnecessary and invasive medical procedure since you are sterile. YTA for not sharing this very pertinent info", "Do you know anything about the potential side effects of tubal ligation? Not just the cost, the risks from any surgery, the time away from work she would need. The other stuff: heavier, more painful periods, weight gain. Did you think of her at all?", "That\u2019s fine, but she deserved to know you are child free because you are sterile. There are other ways for you to have a child.
