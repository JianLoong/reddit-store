Ever.", "NTA, but if making a big deal of this is standing in the way of your ability to face a relationship with your nephew, I\u2019d find a way to let it go. Send him a gift card next time or an actual gift. Though tbh I would make a point to send something to the step nephew too, not that I think your sister had a right to reallocate your gift. That was an AH move.", "NTA. Send your nephew online gift cards directly to his email.", "NTA. Unless he wants cash, have him fill out wish lists or gift registries online.

I would just start saving the money to give to your nephew once he turns 18. I wouldn't waste my time agruing with your sister. I would also let your nephew what happend and explain that once he turns 18 he will have nice lump sum  of birthday & Christmas money waiting for him. I would only send simple inexpensive gifts.

However, I do recommend staying out of it, and only send clothes for future gifts (or other things that are sized). That\u2019s a gift that can\u2019t be split. I also recommend keeping your opinion to yourself. You\u2019re right, but you probably shouldn\u2019t express that so you can keep your relationships with your nephews intact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then when you sent nephew a gift, she got mad at you?  Make sure you put step kids birthday on your calendar. \n\nSend all mail for your nephew directly to him, his name only on the package. If he has email, you can send messages and eGift cards that way.  Or, as others suggested, open a savings account for him. Put gift money there, and send smaller gifts.

It was Christmas which is why he was included in Christmas the year before.", "NTA, you weren\u2019t aware", "Ok well ESH. It was wrong  of your sister to do what she did but you're not faultless either. It's been 3 years, you should know when your step nephews birthday is. This child is a member of your family (or  very shortly will be) You've had three years to find out when the birthday is. Were you planning on continuing to ignore the birthdays? Your sister could have told you but you also could have put the effort in to ask.\n\nEdit: Reddit makes me so sad sometimes. In this case especially for all the children out there whose step families treat them as lesser. Yes OP's sister was clearly an AH. But OPs response to having it be pointed out to her by her sister that she has missed 3 years of her nephew-to-be's birthdays is to start an argument with her sister that's bad enough her sister no longer even wants gifts from her. I mean forget about not knowing the birthday for a second. If my sister pointed out to me that I had forgotten my nephew's birthday (step or not, and yes I do have step nieces and nephews) I would be tripping over myself apologizing to both of them and doing my best to make up for it. All OP would have had to do to resolve the situation was tell her sister to give the money back to her nephew and say she'd send another gift for her nephew to be. It doesn't have to be the same gift but at least something. The fact even doesn't even seem contrite about the missed birthdays makes her an AH in my book.  I'll happily take the down votes this.", "OP has known her nephew since he was born & knew of the stepson for a year before they moved to a different state. Her bond with her nephew vs stepson is very different  to the point she didn\u2019t even know when it was his birthday- thats not OP\u2019s fault. J is being like those weird women (& men too) who take from their own kids to give to their stepchildren to appease their new partners & it\u2019s not cool.", "No doubt the relationship is very special and different nothing wrong with that. And yes her sister is an AH for doing what she did.\n\n>she didn\u2019t even know when it was his birthday- thats not OP\u2019s fault\n\nYeah,see that's where I disagree with you . It is absolutely at least partially her fault that she didn't know.. I think that it is inexcusable that some point over the last 1,000+ days she didn't take the time to ask when the birthday was. And again it is also her sister's at fault for not telling her.", "NTA.  You are related to your nephew, not this other random kid you seem to have next to no relationship to.  If you can, ask your nephew specifically what he wants and send it to him.  Otherwise, set up a bank account for him.  Absolutely not trust his mom with money.", "NTA, start a bank account for him and deposit the money into the account for birthdays and Christmas and other things (got all A's, deposit money, plays a sport and they get to the finals, deposit money), then you can give him access to it when he moves out for college. That way, your sister won't be forcing him to share. Talk to your other sister to see if she wants to join in depositing money for the oldest.", "Next time you see him help him set up a CashApp account. That way you can send money to him directly. That\u2019s what I did for my niece and nephew. He can even get a cash app card with your approval.", "NTA and you need to stop sending it to your sister.  Tell her either he gets it all or she has to return it.  Going forward I'd be buying him what he wants and mailing it directly to him.", "To be honest, why would you get the 9 year a birthday present? I mean, it\u2019s nice if you had, but it\u2019s your choice, since he\u2019s not family to you. \n\nI agree with the suggestions you\u2019re getting. Your sister can\u2019t be trusted to give your nephew any monetary presents, so going forward, anything like that should go into an account.

I'm a big advocate for keeping things equal between children living in a house, regardless of my feelings.", "I would open the account for him and just put the money in there for him and when he turns 18, he can access it and just buy him some gifts that won't cause any rifts and pull him into the siding explain it to him", "Open a college fund and drop money in it for your nephew. Does C's family give your nephew birthday, Christmas gifts?", "From now on put birthday and Christmas money and similar into a college savings account for him- that way it stays safe but he still gets it at some point.  Send only the card. \n\nWhen he turns 18 or becomes a senior in highschool (whichever is first) reach out privately and tell him about it, explain that you wanted to make sure he got to keep what he was given, and hand it over.\n\nNTA", "ESH So you are happy to buy for all 3 kids but you are pissed off that nobody told you about the birthday? Have a conversation.\n\n\u201cSister I need you to remind me about birthdays when they come up.\u201d\n\nAlso have a conversation about intent. You don\u2019t want to give evenly - you want to give more as they get older. Either your sister accepts that or you give the eldest less or you give the others more.", "NTA", "I think you can do this on Facebook do his mother doesn\u2019t have to be involved", "NTA; contact the boy and ask him what he wants directly. A physical object that can't be split in two.", "Time for a family meeting, even over Zoom.", "Your sister is TA. Do not send any more money, instead ask your nephew directly what he wants and/ or need for his birthday. You can also open a bank account for him- make sure your sister does not have any access to the account. Online gift cards sent directly to his email is another idea.", "Great idea. OP NTA", "Most parents have access to their kid's email. Although at least this way her child would know he's being stolen from...", "Probably not wise to give it to him personally, mom might take it from him later to split anyway.", "Yes! That\u2019s my feelings about it! Thank you for explaining it so perfectly!", "She\u2019s met the kid once \u2026.", "Oh wow thank you so much for pointing this out! I haven't met my 2-year-old niece in person at all cuz I can't afford to fly over seas to see her. I didn't realize that that means I have no obligations whatsoever as her aunt. I'll just go delete her birthday from my calendar! Thank you so much for telling me that! I'll ask for those gifts back too /s."]}
