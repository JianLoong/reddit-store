You can start an account for  your newphew and just get small gifts for him to open.

In the future, give your nephew money directly.", "NTA.  Never trust them with money.  Ever.", "NTA, but if making a big deal of this is standing in the way of your ability to face a relationship with your nephew, I\u2019d find a way to let it go. Send him a gift card next time or an actual gift. Though tbh I would make a point to send something to the step nephew too, not that I think your sister had a right to reallocate your gift. That was an AH move.", "NTA. Send your nephew online gift cards directly to his email.", "NTA. Unless he wants cash, have him fill out wish lists or gift registries online.

I would just start saving the money to give to your nephew once he turns 18. I wouldn't waste my time agruing with your sister. I would also let your nephew what happend and explain that once he turns 18 he will have nice lump sum  of birthday & Christmas money waiting for him. I would only send simple inexpensive gifts. Since your sister seems to think she is entitled to dictate how you gift your money.", "NTA-you can\u2019t be an AH for how you feel. However, I do recommend staying out of it, and only send clothes for future gifts (or other things that are sized). That\u2019s a gift that can\u2019t be split. I also recommend keeping your opinion to yourself. You\u2019re right, but you probably shouldn\u2019t express that so you can keep your relationships with your nephews intact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then when you sent nephew a gift, she got mad at you?  Make sure you put step kids birthday on your calendar. \n\nSend all mail for your nephew directly to him, his name only on the package. If he has email, you can send messages and eGift cards that way.  Or, as others suggested, open a savings account for him. Put gift money there, and send smaller gifts.

It was wrong  of your sister to do what she did but you're not faultless either. It's been 3 years, you should know when your step nephews birthday is. This child is a member of your family (or in a very shortly will be) You've had three years to find out when the birthday is. Were you planning on continuing to ignore the birthdays? Your sister could have told you but you also could have put the effort in to ask.", "OP has known her nephew since he was born & knew of the stepson for a year before they moved to a different state. Her bond with her nephew vs stepson is very different  to the point she didn\u2019t even know when it was his birthday- thats not OP\u2019s fault. J is being like those weird women (& men too) who take from their own kids to give to their stepchildren to appease their new partners & it\u2019s not cool.", "No doubt the relationship is very special and different nothing wrong with that. And yes her sister is an AH for doing what she did.\n\n>she didn\u2019t even know when it was his birthday- thats not OP\u2019s fault\n\nYeah,see that's where I disagree with you . It is absolutely at least partially her fault that she didn't know.. I think that it is inexcusable that some point over the last 1,000+ days she didn't take the time to ask when the birthday was. And again it is also her sister's at fault for not telling her."]}
