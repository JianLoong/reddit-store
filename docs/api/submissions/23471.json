When I'm travelling, I usually ask her to stay in my house and take care of my cats. She's sharing a room with her sister(15) at home, so she's always happy when she can have some privacy at my place. I always leave her groceries and some cash for emergencies, and she can do anything as long as the house is clean when I get home. The only ground rule is that she can't invite people over without letting me know, and before any of her friends come over, she introduces them to me. Nothing formal, just to see who I'm letting into my house. We've never had a problem with that until now. \n\nI'm on vacation and I got a call from my neighbour that he saw a stranger in my garden. I checked the security footage, and it turns out Lara's bf(25), Dan, who I've never met, is there for at least 3 days. I called Lara to ask how she's doing. I also asked if she's invited anyone over. She said no without hesitation. I told her I saw Dan on the camera. Radio silence, then she ended the call. I called again, straight to voice mail. An hour later she called me back, said that Dan just quickly visited her, but it's no big deal, because he's a good guy, so just enjoy my vacation, and ended the call again. \n\nNow, she was supposed to go on vacation to my lake house for a week in August. After her call, I wrote a message that since she didn't stick to the rules, lied about it multiple times, and hasn't even apologised, she can't go to the lake house, because I don't trust her to go there unsupervised. She called again, screaming, crying, calling me a heartless, ungrateful b***h, telling me I ruined her summer just because she didn't stick to my stupid, petty rules and she'll never do me a favour ever again. \n\nEver since then, the whole family is bombarding me with calls and texts about how could I treat Lara like this, and why do I have a lake house if I can't even let my niece use it. I tried to explain that everyone's allowed to go there, as long as I know I can trust them, but Lara lost that now because she lied to me and she still thinks she's done nothing wrong. If she at least explained the situation and apologised when I first asked, I wouldn't have cancelled her vacation. My mom thinks I'm right, and it's about time that Lara learns her actions have consequences, but most of the family still thinks I'm an AH.

She broke them.", "\"why do I have a lake house if I can't even let my niece use it.\" Good golly, the entitlement.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nIts perfectly reasonable to be *LIVID* a total stranger 25 year old man was in your home without your knowledge or consent while you were away and you were lied to about it! And you are absolutely correct to take every step to avoid this happening again.", "I'm bothered by that too. I've tried to discuss age gaps in general with her and told her it's better to be careful when older guys are dating teens, but since she's 18, she knows everything better...", "Yes!  I was wondering the same thing.  Add to it that OP said he doesn't have a job, and lives with his parents at 25!  Also the lust not love thing, and only 3 weeks together.  All in all it sounds bad.  Oh, and OP, NTA.  Your house, your rules.  Stick to them.", "Right? I mean, 7 years difference if she was 28 and he was 35 wouldn't be a huge deal. But at the niece's age? It's like dog years, man. There's so much life-experience difference that that age.", "I totally do have an issue with it ... A 7 year age gap when one of the couple is 18 is way too large. She is likely still in high school for goodness sake.", "She\u2019s 18\u2026 she\u2019s a full grown adult.", "The relatives can let her stay at their lakehouses if they feel like she deserves it because 'family'.\n\nOh, they don't have lakehouses to lend? Too bad.\n\nNTA OP!", "Sounds petty but also reasonable. Would consider doing.", "Same. Every person sending me texts defending the niece should get the same message reply back. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way about the situation. I think it\u2019s best that you also refrain from asking to use my beach house. It seems we aren\u2019t on the same page about respect for other peoples property. I invite you to let niece use your beach house instead.\u201d\n\nIt even funnier if they don\u2019t have a beach house.", "I totally agree and would  do that too\u2026 none of them would be invited to my lake house", "The thing is that it's not exactly the human she's in love with. They're together for 3 weeks, and according to my niece, it's lust, not love. They probably just needed a place for sex, because Dan doesn't work and lives with his parents. I accept if people think I was being too harsh or the consequences are too harsh, but inviting a person who you barely know into someone else's house without the owner's knowledge is not a light mistake in my eyes.", "She fucked up at least three times - inviting her boyfriend over, lying again and again, and reacting like a spoiled child instead of apologizing.\n\nAnd it wasn't \"a mistake\". It was deliberate and planned breach of THE rule and OP'S trust.\n\nNTA", "I expected honesty, that's what I expected. I don't think that's unreasonable, no matter how old someone is. I've never told her no when she wanted to invite someone over, including her ex bf, and I specifically told her before this trip that we can discuss her current bf coming over, just let me meet him first", "One of my closest friends already volunteered to be my cat sitter and my cats adore her, so that's not a problem. I've known her for over 25 years and I'd trust her with my life. I only asked my niece, because I know she barely has any privacy at home, and she enjoys staying at my place.", "I wouldn't let this go. Lara broke the very simple rules OP set for their house. When confronted instead of being honest Lara lied. Then when called out for her lies instead of being an adult and apologising, she lied again. Then when OP rightfully told Lara she lost privileges (the lake house) Lara decided verbal abuse was the answer.\n\nLara is behaving like a spoilt brat, spoilt brats need to learn that actions have consequences.\n\nEdit: NTA op", "Anyone else wondering which beds and surfaces in OP\u2019s house the niece and her BF have \u201cdesecrated\u201d? Time for some Febreeze and a washing machine load run on Hot.", "Perhaps save this discussion for later. Your action (response) about the lake house is because she didn\u2019t fulfill her side of the house rules. Keep the focus on that. Once you start making it about the age gap, she feels judged and loses sight of her actions about the house rules being the source of her consequences. Last \u2026 how ANYONE has the nerve to berate you about your own house tiles is quite beyond me !", "Big yikes. I was hella groomed by a 24 year old when I was 17 and he wound up raping me. I hope she stays safe.", "She's 18, she can deal with consequences in the adult world then.", "Then she should act like one and respect her aunts house rules", "She's a teenager. No sane 25 year old would want to be in a relationship with an 18 year old.", "Teenage goes from 13 to age 19. It's in the word. \nPerhaps she's of legal age. But she's not an adult yet, an older teenager, yes. \nAs far as I know, she can't legally drink yet, go to nightclubs, gamble. And renting a car seems to be 21 as well? \n\nSo \"full grown adult\" wouldn't be before she's 21.", "No she isn't. Children don't magically turn into adults the day they turn eighteen. The brain of  a eighteen-year-old is similar to that of a sixteen-year-old, but very different from the brain of  a twenty-five-year-old. Dating a eighteen-year-old as  a twenty-five-year-old is just as bad as dating a sixteen-year-old. An eighteen-year-old is not more mature than a sixteen-year-old.", "I'm sorry, what comes after the 8 or 9 when you say 18 out loud?\n\nThen yes, that is still a fucking teenager. Legally recognized as an adult in terms.of permissions does not make them not a teenager.", "NAT. Looks like they are ok with you being lied to and taken advantage of. I bet you did not do anything but being nice to them so far and they are thinking you are stupid because you are so nice. This is a good chance for you to show them you have boundaries and respect for yourself.", ">I accept if people think I was being too harsh or the consequences are too harsh\n\nNo, you absolutely weren't too harsh. Your niece is inviting someone she's known less than a month into your house?\n\nShe'll be lucky if you ever trust her again. It's time she learns that actions have consequences. The loss of the lake house is the least of her worries. I'd also have issues with what she called you if I were you.", "OP,  you going to change all locks on your lake house this week?  So the niece & Dan cannot go there anyway?", "It does matter how old someone is. She is still a teenager, her brain is not fully developed, she\u2019s cognitively still making decisions with the more emotional part of her brain and you\u2019re holding her to adult standards. I think the rules you set up are fair and it\u2019s frustrating that she broke those rules but creating  a test to see if someone might lie is a real unnecessary set up, sort of seemed like you wanted to catch her in a lie. It\u2019s one thing we try to not to do in schools anymore. Anyways, Is the lake house about trust or just a punishment?", "Absolutely. I\u2019m just saying an 18 year old dating a 25 year old isn\u2019t so strange. Now a 16 year old dating a 22 year old is fucked, but an 18 year old is legally a fully grown adult and a 7 year age gap is not uncommon outside of school.", "Even I, at almost 21, wouldn\u2019t date an 18 year old. The difference in maturity is ridiculous. \n\nA 25 year old going for an 18 year old is an immature 25 year old who can\u2019t get anyone their own age.", "That\u2019s a huge leap. I started dating my s/o when she was 19 and I was 26. We\u2019ve been together 7 years and going strong.", "Your wrong, sorry. https://www.verywellfamily.com/everything-to-know-when-child-turns-18-3570442#:~:text=What%20Happens%20When%20You%20Turn,an%20excuse%20themselves%20from%20school. Also I and she both graduated at 17 about to turn 18, not every 18 year old is in highschool, you either have to miss cutoff or get left back once. Also your gonna sit there and say 18 year olds don\u2019t drink? Maybe not at a bar but I did plenty of drinking before I was 21.", "I think if she's old enough to date adults and go on week long vacations alone, and also remind everyone around her on every possible occasion that she's legally an adult, so she can't be treated as a child anymore, than I can hold her to adult standards. Not that I think that honesty should be considered adult standard. The lake house is a consequence of me losing my trust in her.", "Gross", "Blergh.", "Both of my grandparents met at 19/26 and have been happily married for roughly 60 years now.. my parents are a few years apart, too, and met when my mom was in her late teens and my dad in his early 20s (they met at work, mind you, same kinda job/seniority level) - they've been married for more than 35 years now  \nBUT -  I 100% agree that there's risks that come with different maturity levels and being at different stages of life, OP is not wrong to ask the niece to be careful - and even without the age gap, she shouldn't be bringing her bf over without permission...   \nOn top of that, niece's reaction was also really shitty and immature, which makes me wonder about the bf's intentions/maturity level, too - in this situation", "I was 17 & my hubby was 24 when we met & we\u2019ve been very happily married now for 32 yrs (I was 20 when we got married). But I was a very mature 17yr old as my Mum had died when I was 13 leaving my poor Dad devastated so I picked up the pieces & took on the role of cooking cleaning paying bills plus school etc at that age (we had no other family to help us & there weren\u2019t resources out there during the 80s in the UK to help out, you were just left to get on with it) so I had been a defacto adult since then. So I was not your average 17yr old; I knew more about running a house & adulting than my hubby! So we\u2019re more the exception rather than the rule. \n\nAll that said it does make me uncomfortable to see a young person dating an older one like that. Especially when she kicks off like this as that screams immaturity", "The very definition in the dictionary about teenage is its the \"teen years\" so 13-19. \n\nJust because you count 18 as \"adult\" legally for some stuff. She's still an older teenager. Who legally doesn't have all the perks of adulthood, which is at 21.\n\nBoyfriend can drink and a whole other deal of things she can't.", "Ah yes a few weeks makes all the difference \ud83d\ude12 creepy as fuck", "Why?", "It\u2019s not for everyone, absolutely, but it\u2019s not as uncommon as these people are trying to make it out to be and it\u2019s definitely not gross or predatory in an of itself (of course any relationship can be predatory). An age gap of 7 years isn\u2019t even outside of a generation, definitely room for an overlap of hobbies and interests.", "An an 18 year old teenager is a legal adult.

And stop excusing grown men who go for teens.", "18 years is not a magical milestone that automatically makes you mature and responsible. Yes, certain laws do not restrict you at 18, but most people are still just a immature and irresponsible as they were at 17/16/15 etc.\nAdditionally, a 18 yo woman might not have the same experience as anyone above 21, so they might not have much in common, so at least from someone outside the relationship, it looks like an adult interested in a child.", "Old enough to vote but not old enough to even rent a car or be let into a lot of places. \nShe is an adult, perhaps in one sense. But it's wrong to use a term \"fully\" adult when she can't do 100% of what an adult can. \n\nThe boyfriend is 5 years from 30, chasing a freshly \"adult person\" \nShe is..... either freshly 18, halfway through 18. But fresh to \"adult life\" still. \nShe's not even done with the education system yet."]}
