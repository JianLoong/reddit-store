Therefore you need to find a job that can pay you. That's simple. It's upsetting, but it's not an option to keep working for nothing so why question it?\n\nI also don't understand why you're mad at this family member for filing for unemployment. She's not getting paid. What do you expect her to do? She is in the right. It's not her fault you chose to work for free for a year.\n\n'My whole family, career and life are gone' - this seems rather dramatic. A business failed because of theft. It's awful, but you go and get another job and continue your career and your life. \n\nIf the company cannot pay the *only* person who knows how to fix it, and is still relying on at least three people working for free a year after the theft, then company is already bust. It's already over.", "Info: have you not reported the thief? It sounds like you haven\u2019t reported them. If you reported all this correctly you could work through things. \n\nTwo why would you be paying her unemployment? You pay money to the state for unemployment insurance. When she files for unemployment just fill out the forms they send you accurately. If she doesn\u2019t even have pay stubs then her claim won\u2019t get far anyway. If she isn\u2019t an employee then when you fill out the forms it will show that. If she is and she gets unemployment the state pays it. You may have to pay more money to the state depending on how many previous claims they have paid out. But you wouldn\u2019t be giving money to her directly. Just the fact you don\u2019t understand this makes me think your a clueless teenager writing bad fiction. \n\nThree if they are not an employee or being paid why should they do anything to help the company? \n\nThe more I think on this the more I realize this is probably fake.", "Michael Bluth, that you?", "NTA.

How does it affect you at all if she files for it?", "I mean I just confused because the way you describe things is not how they work which is why I doubt your story. Unemployment is funded through payroll taxes. It\u2019s like a set amount of money based on employee wages. It can also go up if you have a lot of claims. All this money is pooled to give to unemployed people. You can owe back taxes but you don\u2019t make unemployment payments. Someone having filed a claim last year might make your regular payments go up (although I doubt any one employee would be enough to raise any employers rates), but that would have no effect on anything going forward but the slight increase in payroll taxes. You wouldn\u2019t be making monthly payments directly attributed to this one fired employee. You wouldn\u2019t be paying this new fraudulent claim directly either. It is not like they say you fired person x  send us 7k dollars. It\u2019s more like they say for the year 2023 instead of pay $400 per month (no idea your employee amount) you pay $420 a month. But it isn\u2019t directly because of an ongoing claim it would be because you have a lot of claims in your history.", "You\u2019re in the US I assume.
