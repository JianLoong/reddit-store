{"id": 27324, "submission_id": "16obyoa", "title": "AITA for finding another job immediately after my manager re-did our entire task system because of my complaint?", "selftext": "Sorry if my thoughts are jumbled I'm trying to add context where needed. Basically as the title describes. \n\nI put a complaint (it wasn't a formal one just a 1:1 discussion with the manager) about the assistant manager after I felt I was being taken advantage of in terms of work. During the managers holiday he was going through a rough patch and I offered to help where I could. This \"help\" became me doing all of his job for him while he sat on his phone. For hours I worked on setting up tools to make his job easier. I never got a thanks and he didn't do anything with these, expecting me to finish them off later for him. He was also assigning 90% of day tasks to myself and the 10% to him he'd just not bother to do then assign it to me the next day. Basically, I was doing 2 people's job and he was planning to pass it off as his work. I genuinly wanted to walk out and quit.\n\nSo I complained to the manager when she came back that I refused to do the job of two people and the task system the assistant manager used was broken. There were other issues with the assistant manager she was dealing with on top, it wasnt a new thing. He took advantage of my help and I wanted to leave. She listened to my complaint, which I greatly appreciated, and it resulted in the entire \"task system\" we use being overhauled completely and made a week in advance. At one point the manager cried on shift because of the stress dealing with his refusal to work and needing to change everything after I said I wanted to walk out.\n\nWhich adds a layer of guilt to the main AITA point.\n\nI was contacted by an employer the night AFTER I complained and decided to check out the application. Its gotten to the final stages and I have a good chance of getting the job, so I decided to let my manager know Ive been looking into a new job and if they say yes id be putting in my 2 weeks notice. I know some people may not think that's a great idea but I didn't want to leave her in the lurch after everything she's done for me. \n\nShe reacted poorly, told me how she'd changed the whole store around and our jobs just to appease me and now I'm \"fucking off out of nowhere\", and has refused to speak to me outside job related topics. She's usually very professional and I could tell it was the stress and hurt why she acted that way. I get her point however as she did do a great deal for me and as soon as she fixed it I've decided to nope out \n\nSo my main question is am I being a dick for complaining about work and having everything changed just to possibly leave soon after?", "created_utc": 1695290851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16obyoa/aita_for_finding_another_job_immediately_after_my/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Furthermore, management would let you go in a heartbeat if it was in their economic interest.  It is just business.  You have to take care of your own career and jump at opportunities when they arrise.", "NTA, except slightly to yourself for telling your manager that you were looking for a new job.\n\nNever tell your current company you are looking for a new job if you can possibly avoid it.\n\nThey'd let you go in a heartbeat if they decided that you were \"surplus to requirements\", and the issues with the task system that allowed the Assistant Manager to behave in the way they did would have needed fixing sooner or later anyway - those are not your fault.\n\nSimilar happened to me - I had to create a shitstorm at work to get something sorted that I could probably legitimately have actually sued them over. All I wanted, was that thing done, I wasn't interested in the stress of legal proceedings, etc (note: this wasn't an equalities thing, it was a purely contractual thing). A week later, I got another job offer. I kept quiet until I had the offer in writing, then handed my notice in, worked that four weeks, and quit. No muss, no fuss. Served them fucking right for fucking up the contract of employment.", "NTA - she didn't fix the issue for you, she fixed it so the person occupying your position wouldn't be f*cked by the assistant manager. Whether it's you or not is irrelevant, it had to be done.", "NTA\n\nWhen you complained, you had no idea that a job was coming along.  Plus the overhaul needed to be done, it not when it did, but when the newbie started, they would complain about the assistant manager. \n\nWas it poor timing?  Sure, yes it was.\n\nDid the overhaul need to happen?  Yes, it sure did.  By the sounds of it, it was overdue.\n\nCould the manager have handled this situation better?  Yes, most definitely.", "NTA for finding another job. Y T A for telling your boss before you had secured the new job. Your boss is not your friend. You are her worker, and if it comes down to it, she will look out for herself before looking out for you. In the future, wait until you have a job offer and a start date before telling your current job you are leaving. \n\nAs far as the original situation, she was not looking for a solution just for you. It was a problem that had to be fixed, and you lit a fire under her ass to do it, but no matter what, it\u2019s her job to solve problems that arise. It wasn\u2019t because you needed help personally, it was because there is an issue in her store, and she\u2019s ultimately responsible for it.", "NTA\n\nYour work complaint was reasonable and appropriate. You're also free to take a new position elsewhere any time you want.", "NTA- you need to look out for yourself. The system was flawed and needed to be changed. That\u2019s a management & upper management responsibility. Had she been on top of things- her asst. manager would have been supported and the fact that they weren\u2019t doing their job could have been handled sooner. She may be pissed because she now has to replace and train 2 people.", "i mean, you complained, they tried to fix it and you're leaving anyway. not sure you're an A, but why complain if you were going to leave anyway? \n\nI can see why your boss is frustrated about that, but feel no guilt for the change of the system, if they decided to modfiy it, it means it was not so efficient afterall.", "You don\u2019t ever have to feel guilty about bettering your career, no matter the circumstances. It is strictly a business decision. You are clearly worth more than what your employer provided. ETA: NTA", "Kind of TA. Why complain and create all this work for your manager to cater to your requirements (she sounds like a pretty good boss btw) just to leave? Why not say nothing then leave?\n\nAlso, way to shoot yourself in the foot there. You never ever tell your boss you\u2019re looking for another job before you secure it. What happens if they don\u2019t pick you then you\u2019re stuck at your job with a manager who knows you have one foot out the door? You\u2019ll jeopardise your job because they\u2019ll stop giving you responsibilities, no career progression, you\u2019ll be treated with a bit of attitude and they\u2019ll likely push you out the door because why waste time developing an employee who\u2019s leaving? They\u2019d rather replace you ASAP.", "NTA\n\nYou got contacted  by this employer right after you complained, so I guess the changes were not made yet. \n\nI can understand that the manager's feeling bad but if she did not make the changes for you, she would have had to do it at some point anyway. The whole system was bad, and she was already dealing with this assistant manager.

You just happened to get an offer for a better paid job at the same time. There's not many people who would turn down a better job, just because they feel bad. \n\nTiming wasn't great but that's not your fault, nor was it your initial intention when you put in the complaint.\n\nI think your right, I think the manager popped off because they're stressed. Don't take it too personally. Plus, you're leaving soon (hopefully), so just do what you need to do and go", "Had she not changed the system now, he would be treating someone else this way. It would eventually come to a head. If anything, you've made a future employee's working conditions better. If the system changed for all employees, I am certain there are many others who have or will benefit from this.\n\nYou do not owe your manager or your workplace/employers to stay. Regarding work, you need to do what's good for you and look out for yourself. It's great to do that while being considerate of others, kind and professional, but you don't owe anyone \"loyalty\". You shot yourself in the foot a bit by telling your manager in advance although I do see that you meant well. \n\nThe manager is clearly lashing out and taking the stress of the situation out on you. You've mentioned she's having trouble getting the assistant manager to cooperate at least a little. He's the source of the stress, but she cannot lash out at him because he'll dig his feet in even more. You were an easier target. I hope she was just overcome with emotion and lashing out in frustration when she said she overhauled it all just to \"appease you\" - because that's absolutely not the right attitude to have here. The problem existed, you just brought it to her attention. I suppose with all the stress she might feel like her life would be easier if you hadn't said anything - which is okay for her to feel, but not okay for her to take out on you. You were right to speak up. If she truly did this just to \"appease you\", then she is not a great manager or a great person.\n\nNTA.

A rational reaction on their part would be to replace you, since they can no longer count on you.\n\nIt's entirely rational to leave for better pay and conditions.
