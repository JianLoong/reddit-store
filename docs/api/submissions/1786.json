I asked her a few questions about what is going on to understand the context. I had to ask multiple questions because the material was not clear enough to begin with.\n\nI had two problems with her. First, she often started speaking before I even finished my question. Her replies were not relevant or did not answer my questions. I also had to explain things often, and she interrupted with not as relevant information. I tried to keep speaking to subtly hint her that she is interrupting. This was also right before lunchtime and I found that her behavior was counterproductive.\n\nShe does the interrupting to everyone, at least in the workplace. There were other instances where she answered questions with completely irrelevant content.\n\nSecond is that I found that she clearly misinterpreted a sentence from the material. I told her this, but she insisted her interpretation was correct. I found this off-putting (I interpreted this as an ego problem on her side) and told her that you asked me for help, and I cannot help you if we do not agree on this.\n\nAfter that I asked her are you aware you are interrupting, and she first said we talked about this before. I said yes, and you kept on doing it since then. She said I\u2019m sorry you feel that way, which I found was a weird apology because it\u2019s shifting the focus to my interpretation of her behavior. I went on and told her I am not looking for an apology, but when you are talking with people please wait until the other person completes the sentence, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s productive, and I think most people would find it off-putting. I tried to sugarcoat it by saying I don\u2019t think you mean bad, you are just not aware of it.\n\nLater I found out from my boss that she was crying and took an offense from what I said. This reaction from her was just, beyond me at this stage.

I have had to deal with this myself and I just say excuse me you need to let me finish. If they get upset I just say it\u2019s rude and drags the problem out.", "NTA. I'm somebody who sometimes gets excited and interrupts people, and if I've ever gotten corrected, I've been grateful and sincerely apologetic. I say thank you so much for reminding me, and I do not complain to other people or cry about it to make them feel bad for me. If she's going to be confident enough to interrupt people, she needs to be confident enough to take the feedback. You can't have it both ways. She can't have her cake and eat it too. That's what she's trying to do here. It's bullshit.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you were direct and stuck to the facts rather than feelings (despite her interpretation of what you said to her). \n\nIt's exhausting to deal with this kind of communication style. But if you are tasked by the manager to be this person's helper, then you need to do it. Be consistent with her every time. If she interrupts, stop her and remind her to listen to the complete context of what you're saying before replying. If she answers with inconsistent information, stop her and tell her she's off topic. Continue doing it in the kind, matter-of-fact way you've described here. Again, exhausting, but the only way to go. \n\nMake sure your manager is on board with what you're doing. They've probably seen the same patterns and they will likely see her get upset again because you're continually \"correcting\" her communication style. So if the manager isn't on board with your way of handling it, then it could end up being a problem for you.\n\nShe's probably doing the best she can. Whatever the cause of her behavior, it's how she's learned to move through the world and she's not doing it just to annoy you. Chances are she's frustrated, too, and doesn't fully understand why. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA you were firm but fair. \n\nI've known people who repeatedly interrupt for various reasons. \n\nSome are self-centred and egotistical and not listening. Some are overly excited/can't focus/don't realise how it's a problem. \n\nBut either way, neither are productive in that situation and if they're coming to you for help they need to bite their tongue and let you speak. Especially when you raise it and ask them to.\n\nIt's incredibly frustrating to be constantly interrupted, and for me personally it makes it very very hard to explain what I'm trying to explain because it derails the train of thought that i'm using to help you. \n\nI think you were polite. Not sugar-sweet nice, but polite enough while clearly pointing out the probem in an objective way, which seems needed because she knows she's doing it and is persisting anyway. \n\nIn the past I have resorted to just repeating 'Please let me finish. I'm still speaking, please let me finish what I'm saying' over and over until they stop talking. Infuriating, but it eventually worked.", "NTA. It's rude for anyone to interrupt or talk over another person.

To say they were involved would be the understatement of a lifetime. They were all from different places with different ideas and they debated all day, every day. One, a female from Canada was really smart but she would go on and on. So a man fromNew York would always loudly interrupt her. So she would always say let me finish Marty! She said it so often we all just said it to each other when any of us interrupted the other. I said to Don let me finish Marty, when he interrupted me. So a new guy thought I was rude and said that I had interrupted him before too. I just said, it\u2019s an inside joke and everyone knows it even Marty.

I am far less polite to my sister than you were to your colleague so kudos to you for that. \n\nYou me tion that your boss mentioned that she was upset after you pointed it out to her, did you boss agree that your colleague has the tendency to overtalk people or did your boss give you a reprimand for pointing out her frustrating habit? If its the latter and your boss reprimanded you for it, then next time she needs help then pont her to your boss and ask them to explain the work to her. Alt if you do choose to help her again, when she starts overtalking then stop talking and wait an uncomfortable length of time after she has stopped talking to then continue from the exact same place as when you stopped talking. After about 2 or 3 of those she will twigg what you are doing. She may go running to the boss again, but all she can tell the boss is that you stopped talking to allow her to finish, which is the polite thing to do. Make it your bosses problem if she is not willing to learn.", "NAH.\n\nCommunication is a two way street, not everyone thinks about conversation in the same way. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for asking her to let you finish your sentence, but she\u2019s also not being an AH for having a bad conversational habit. Maybe it\u2019s something she\u2019s sensitive about and is trying to work on? Who knows, but you\u2019re not exactly being easy to talk to here.

I finally realized I interupted and talked too much because no one in my family ever listened to me, so I felt I had to fight to be heard.

If you hear hooves don't think zebras.

However with the stigma attached to the diagnosis lots of people tend to hide it.\n\n\nMy suggestion is that you firmly repeat that she's interrupting you.. On repeat.. And repeat.. And repeat..

It\u2019d still be on her to find a way to change that behavior. \n\nAnd sure, that may be hard, but showing awareness of the issue and giving others at least some sense that you\u2019re trying to address it would likely already go a long way.

When my meds are kicking down, word salad doesn't even begin to explain what comes out of my mouth. I literally can't string a sentence together and what comes out sounds like a belligerent weirdo.\n\nAnd I agree with you.. Most of us lead with our disability so as not to be misunderstood. Maybe the coworker is undiagnosed or stubbornly refuses to take meds. That is definitely an issue as well. Many of us feel like we lose a bit of ourselves under meds.\n\nNot excusing her behavior but I recognize some of the things OP is writing about..

Maybe my narc radar is too active, but info never hurts and even if it isn't relevant with this co-worker it might save OP hurt in the future if they know what to look for. \n\nSorry you experience communication (and life?) Like that when the medication is wearing off. That would be so hard to manage. I'm glad you have some tools to help you experience things at a more accessible pace at least some of the time.", "I don't even realize that my meds are wearing off until I start to speak and it's garbled nonsense. Fortunately I have good friends and coworkers who will say to me that I'm beginning to sound silly.\n\nHonestly I prefer not to be medicated for the extra energy but I prefer to be medicated so I can function in society. I'll take the exhaustion from the meds any day as opposed to not being functional.
