{"id": 22554, "submission_id": "152xfix", "title": "AITA for playing poker instead of helping entertain a kid?", "selftext": "I (f31) am on a group holiday with my husband, two of his friends (Chris and Jake), Chris's girlfriend Sara, her 4yo son (not Chris's), and my daughter, who is 3. We have been on the holiday a week and have another week left.\n\nMy husband and I brought our nanny along on the trip, and every day from 2pm - 5pm she supervises my daughter's nap, and then plays with her. The rest of the time my daughter is with me or my husband, and while some may think it's excessive to have a nanny travel just for three hours a day, I find that 3 hours of uninterrupted adult time is invaluable to me because it allows me to recharge. \n\nSo, yesterday, during these hours, I was sitting by the pool at our rented villa, playing poker with Chris, Jake, and my husband. Sara was in and out of the pool with her son, playing with him. She asked several times where my daughter was and I told her down for a nap, and when the nanny came outside (she had the baby monitor with her) Sara asked if the nanny could watch her kid to which I said no, because she's not communal property to be passed around to whoever needs it. Sara then asked if I would come and play with her son, to which I said no (because I was maxed out on kids and in the middle of doing something). She stopped asking and ignored us all. \n\nLater that evening while getting ready for dinner she pulled me aside and told me she thought it was rude of me to hang out with the guys instead of spending time with her and her son, and since I had three hours free and have them daily, that I could have offered to split that time with her. I countered that she was only asking me because I was a woman, and that it isn't my job or my idea of a holiday to babysit.\n\nShe has since told Chris I was rude to her. He says I was right not to help but maybe could have just said sorry to keep the peace. She's been sulking all day today, is in a bad mood with her son, and it's made the whole vibe awkward. I don't think I'm in the wrong for thinking this was not my problem. But am I?", "created_utc": 1689684105, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152xfix/aita_for_playing_poker_instead_of_helping/", "score": 85, "replies": ["NTA.  Why didn't she ask her husband to spend some daddy time with their child?  Better yet, why didn't he just volunteer?", "Why did Sara ask you for help instead of Chris? Chris is her partner, not you. \nWhy did Sara or Chris not ask about hiring your nanny part-time to give Sara a break?\nBecause they didn't want to pay the nanny and thought that maybe she could do the extra work since she was already being paid by you.\nYes, you could have asked the nanny if she wanted to take on the extra work, PAID by Sara/Chris, of course. Had she been willing, you could have allowed them to speak and had your nanny negotiate her fee. Sara could then pay the fee or scoffed. \nMy money is on the scoff. NTA", "NTA.  You're taking advantage of your three hours a day of adult time.  If she wanted uninterrupted adult time, she should arrange for her own sitter or arrange with your nanny in advance.", ">I (f31) am on a group holiday with *my husband, two of his friends (Chris and Jake), Chris's girlfriend Sara*, her 4yo son (not Chris's), and my daughter, who is 3\n\nSara is not even *your friend*. She's your husband's friend's gf. But she expects you to spend your free time playing with her son? Ignore her sulking and enjoy your holiday. NTA.", "NTA. Sara is selfish and entitled and probably bitter that you and your husband were able to arrange for a nanny to go with you, and she and her boyfriend weren\u2019t. Why was she bothering you and not Chris to come over and help with supervising her child? Chris is also the AH for insisting that you were being rude. Sara\u2019s child may not be his, but he is in a relationship with her, not you, and *he* should have left the poker table to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d. \n\nAlso, good on you for establishing boundaries with how your nanny was hired for your child and not to take on other kids just because their parent feels entitled. It\u2019s not like Sara was even offering to pay extra for that, was she? Just expecting free babysitting. I bet your nanny thinks you are a better employer for that.", "NTA. Sorry, that's what happens when you bring a toddler on vacay. You have to watch them. Unless you have something pre-arranged (like bring your nanny) or there are some babysitting services you utilize. Good on you for not making your nanny feel obligated to watch someone else's kid. Also nice of you to not make her watch your kid the whole holiday.\n\nCurious, if you want to go out on a datenight, does the nanny babysit?", "NTA. Whatever arrangement you have with your nanny  is none of Sara\u2019s business. Whatever agreement Chris and Sara have about care for her son is between them\u2014even if she doesn\u2019t like it.", ">He says I was right not to help but maybe could have just said sorry to keep the peace.\n\n\"To keep the peace\"  I always think this is such a cowardly cop out.\n\nYou refuse to take care of Sara's child, now she is angry.  On the flipside, you get roped into taking care of Sara's child, you become angry.  \n\nThere is no peace here when you look at the root cause of this problem.  A child needs to be monitored and taken care of.\n\n\\-Sara doesnt want to take care of her own son while on vacation\n\n\\-Chris is not helping his girlfriend.\n\n\\-OP should have told Chris to help out his own girlfriend with her own kid before coming to bother OP.  You know \"to keep the peace\"\n\nOP you are NTA.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\n\n\nBut chris kind of is. He should've jumped in and giving sara some time off too.", "NTA. And my first thought is she can go pound sand. But if she decides to stop being a brat, maybe you offer to watch her kid with your husband for an evening. But that would just be super nice, not the least bit necessary", "NTA - Wow Sara is entitled: I can't afford a nanny but you can so either let me use her  or you tend to my kid since you don't have to right now. That's a big hell no. Yes, you have free time because you knew you wanted some you time and you are paying for that time. She can't and that's a her problem. If she was going to ask anyone for a break it should have been Chris. I understand the kid isn't his but I mean he is dating a girl with a kid, so he should be willing to take on a little bit of time with the child to give his girl a break.", "Question, pls:  Did you tell Sara that maybe you could ask your nanny if she would be interested in working different hours to babysit Sara's son (WITH PAY, of course)?  Did you ask Sara if she would be interested in paying for your nanny to work for her (on different time slots than caring for your child)?", "NTA. Let me guess \"spending some time with her and her son\" meant to her \"Hey, I have to go to the toilet for a second, can you just watch my son?\" and then leave for a nap for some hours?", "You aren't the asshole for how you chose to spend your time, but you are the asshole for refusing to let your nanny work with her. The way you said it was also pretty rude. You're not the only mom in need of a break. You could have checked in with the nanny to see if she would be willing to take on another child. Of course, her services wouldn't be free, but the couple could pay her. She doesn't seem overbooked either. Seriously, just help another woman in need. You both want the same thing.", "[deleted]", "INFO: If you're paying a nanny to be there already, why not offer to have her help out with the other child too?\n\nDo you have a personal dislike of Sara?", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, you need your free time to recharge that\u2019s why you brought the nanny and your right she\u2019s not communal property.  I assume she\u2019s contracted exclusively to your family, should something happen to another child she would be liable and that sounds like a breach of contract.  I\u2019m sure if you told the friend this she would say something along the lines of \u201cnothing is going to happen\u201d and when something indeed does happen they are all surprised. There are limits to keeping the peace, she just wants some free time to herself. Kids are exhausting and parents deserve free time away from them you made accommodations for your child and they didn\u2019t, and wanna bum off you for handouts.", "They're not married, and her son is not Chris's.", "She would, yes, and she does at home once a week. On this holiday so far we've been taking our daughter to dinner with us/staying at the house for dinner.", "I try to be as respectful as I can of my nanny's time, and her position in my household. I think as her employer, me asking her to do extra things, even with pay, is a level of undue pressure because I don't know how easy it would be for her to say no. Sara could have asked her, she didn't. \n\nAdditionally, my nanny works for an agency that contracts out. She doesn't have coverage for liability looking after another kid, and since she would technically be doing this extra childcare within the hours she is working for me (I pay her 6 days a week, even if she isn't actively doing childcare), she would be going against her contract. I obviously don't mind, but again, I don't know if she would be comfortable with it, and that's something Sara would have to work out with her.", "I've elaborated elsewhere on how my contract with the nanny works and why I didn't feel comfortable asking her. I am trying to create a good work environment for her and be a good employer, especially in a foreign environment where she is dependent on us.\n\nSara could have spoken to her, she chose not to.", "She can ask my nanny whatever she wants, but I wouldn't feel comfortable asking her. I try to be conscious of the fact that even if she would be getting extra money, she doesn't have liability coverage for looking after another child (she works through an agency) and she may not want to, and I don't know how easy it would be for her to say no to me, being that I'm her employer.\n\nSara could have asked her herself, she didn't.", "My nanny is a whole person, she's not something I can just offer to other people without her consent. She works through an agency, she has liability coverage for my daughter and my daughter only, it's actually going against her contract to be looking after other kids (I wouldn't mind if she wanted to but I certainly think it would be out of order to push her to do so). Plus, maybe she doesn't want to look after an extra kid? I know she works for me but I try my best not to take advantage of her.\n\nI don't have a personal dislike of Sara at all. I had only met her once before this holiday, I always thought she was nice, until this.", ">If you're paying a nanny to be there already, why not offer to have her help out with the other child too?\n\nBc that would take time away from the daughter.  OP is paying the nanny.  Sara is not entitled to that time", "Well if you date someone with a kid and go on vacation with him, the child not being biologically his doesn\u2019t mean he gets to ignore them. \n\nChris seems like not the best boyfriend.", "You\u2019re not married to her and her son isn\u2019t yours\u2026 but her significant other spending time with her is more appropriate than you taking your adult time on your vacation to help babysit.", "That's not a good excuse for him not helping out.", "She could still ask her boyfriend to watch her kid.", "I respect tf out of this response and honestly think it\u2019s the right answer. NTA.", "[deleted]", "You don't need to justify yourself at all!  \nPeople are just trying to poke holes in your story and find something to make you look bad as poor Sara had to take care of her own child.....  \nAnd she could have asked Chris for help, why bother you? So you are right, she is not only jealous of you for having free time but also sexist. \n\nThe nanny works for you so only your child is her responsibility and of story.\n\nNTA", "NTA, especially with the agency thing. Depending on her contract, she may not be permitted to watch other children during the hours where she is contracted to you. And again, not sure about her contract, but you aren\u2019t actually her employer. You hired the agency to provide you with a nanny, and I assume you pay the agency\u2014unless it if more of a recruiting service?", "Turn the situation around\u2014maybe it\u2019s not dislike of Sara, but it\u2019s definitely unlikeable behavior for someone that you\u2019ve met once to expect you to either provide childcare directly or through their nanny.", "> without her consent\n\nYou could discuss it with her and see if she's open to it too.\n\nThat all sounds absurd tbh. It honestly sounds like you dislike Sara.", "No one said anything about entitled.\n\nThis is a case where OP is technically correct but the way she's talking about it makes her come off as an asshole in general.", "Seriously, he ain't exactly showing that he's marriage material for this woman.", "Absolutely true. I do think she should have asked him. I was just correcting the context :)", "She could have, she should have, she didn't. As of today, she still hasn't.", "I said she's not communal property, because Sara was suggesting that I offer her the nanny's services without asking her, as if I should order her to do extra childcare, as if that was my decision. From my point of view that is not the case.", "Yes, we do pay the agency, and she isn't meant to watch other kids, because even if she's not actively watching my daughter, she's still working for me during those hours. Again, I wouldn't mind if she wanted to do that, but I'm definitely not asking her directly to go against her contract and do that. Because at the end of the day, that puts her between a rock and a hard place. She could say yes to me now and put herself at risk later if we end up on bad terms, or she can say no now and feel uncomfortable. Also her insurance/liability coverage is through the agency, it doesn't extend to other kids.\n\nI really do try to be as sensitive as I can to the power dynamic. She's a lovely woman, our daughter adores her, she's great at her job, my way of thanking her is trying to create a good work environment.", "And then she could feel like it was coercive. So op should ruin her relationship with her nanny for the sake of another parent who can\u2019t even ask her bf to help entertain her kid? Op is not responsible for Sara\u2019s kid. If it was an issues this should have been discussed before the trip.", "And Sara\u2019s not the AH for expecting free child care?", "And Sara\u2019s not the AH for expecting free child care?", "Right - and OP making it very clear its not Chris\u2019s son is very cringey to me.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "How would it be coercive?", "She asked, but it doesn't say she expected it.", "She asked, but it doesn't say she expected it.", "I got that vibe too.", "Do you not understand the implications of OP asking the nanny to work extra in this situation? It\u2019s not certain that the nanny would feel like they\u2019re in a position to turn OP or the other mom down. Shame on you for even suggesting that as an option, OP did exactly what a serious and responsible employer should\u2019ve done.", "She\u2019s under contract and could feel like she has to agree. Ya know like most people who need their jobs? OP has already given answers in all her comments about this. Sara was entitled and should have planned better.", "Being pissy with everyone, acting like a loner because some said to take care of her own kid, complaining to her that op didn\u2019t help take care of her son, sounds a lot like she expected Op to give in", "Yep, very bad vibes. Sounds like that Chris has already ignored Sarah's child in the past, so she knows she can't count on him (not a good reason to ask OP to babysit her child, of course, and OP is NTA)", "Sounds like that was more in response to OPs rude approach."]}
