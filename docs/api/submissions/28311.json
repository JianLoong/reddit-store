The day of the meeting my wheelchair battery almost completely stopped working, and even though my co-presenter and I had agreed to arrive 15 min early, the meeting was almost about to start by the time we arrived, due to my wheelchair moving so slowly. I was right behind her, attempting to enter the room when she let the door close in my face. I gestured for her to hit the auto-door opener because there was only one on her side of the door. She neither let me in nor told anyone that I was outside waiting for the door to be opened. Instead she told them I couldn't make it because of wheelchair problems so people we pretty surprised when I finally found someone to push the door open for me.   \nLater on my co-presenter admitted to doing this purposefully, she said \"why would I tell them, you already made us late I wasn't going to allow you to disrupt the meeting any more.\" (We weren\u2019t late, just not early, and once able to enter, it took all of 45 secs to join the group.)

Part of me thinks that's petty because it happened months ago (she only just admitted what had happened) and I still did get to attend the majority of the meeting.   \nAm I the asshole for wanting to exposing her bad behaviour, thus potentially torpedoing a project that could help other people with disabilities?
