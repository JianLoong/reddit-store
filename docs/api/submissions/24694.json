My son's mother isn't in the picture, she found another man and decided she wanted nothing to do with us. I also have a twin sister (26F), who got married yesterday to her husband (25M), who is part of my friend group. I'm friends with most of my sister's friends and vice versa. \n\nThe wedding was child free, with the only exceptions being bridesmaids and groomsmens children. I wasn't asked to be a groomsman, which I found very upsetting because I am very close to my sister and her husband, but also because that meant I wouldn't be able to bring my son. My son is a very important part of my life, but so is my sister, and I wouldnt want to let her down.\n\nThe trouble was, I couldn't find a babysitter, at all. Everyone I could've possibly asked was going to the wedding. All my siblings, my parents, my aunts and uncles, my cousins, my friends, everyone. On top of that, I don't have the money for a babysitter, nor would I ever trust a stranger with my son. The child free rule was extremely difficult to adapt to.\n\nIn the end, I decided I was going to bring my son and ask my sister if he could be the ring bearer, since I knew they didn't have one. I thought he could be quite helpful as he's a well behaved kid. Boy, was I wrong. \n\nWhen I got to the wedding, my sister blew up at me and said I completely disrespected her boundaries. When I suggested she included him in the wedding she got even more annoyed, and told me it was her wedding and that I didn't get to choose who was in it. She said I ruined her wedding day and asked me to leave, which I did as to not cause too big of a problem. \n\nToday , most of my family blew up my phone with angry calls and messages telling me how upset my sister was with me. However, my 2 older brothers and my best friend were on my side saying that she wasn't being fair on me. \n\nI don't see how i'm the asshole. In my point of view she's being a complete bridezilla, but clearly these people think differently, so I'm asking you, Reddit. AITA?\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the comments. I understand why I'm the asshole now. You're all right, I should've asked earlier, or even not going wouldve been a better option. \n\nAs to answer a few questions:\n\n\nI don't know why I wasn't in the wedding party. None of my family was. It was all my sister's husbands side. She didn't explain why or give any further details.\n\nWhen I say me and my sister are close, I mean VERY close. We've spent all our lives together, and until she got engaged we spoke everyday. After she got engaged she started to distance herself more with no explanation and while I was confused I didn't ask for an explanation because she isn't obligated to spend every second of the day with me.\n\nThe children invited to the wedding were around 1-3 each.\n\n\nI'm going to reach out to my sister and try to make things right. I'll be back with another update sometime soon.", "created_utc": 1692101574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rqykq/aita_for_bringing_my_son_to_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 884, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My son's mother isn't in the picture, she found another man and decided she wanted nothing to do with us. I also have a twin sister (26F), who got married yesterday to her husband (25M), who is part of my friend group. I'm friends with most of my sister's friends and vice versa. \n\nThe wedding was child free, with the only exceptions being bridesmaids and groomsmens children. I wasn't asked to be a groomsman, which I found very upsetting because I am very close to my sister and her husband, but also because that meant I wouldn't be able to bring my son. My son is a very important part of my life, but so is my sister, and I wouldnt want to let her down.\n\nThe trouble was, I couldn't find a babysitter, at all. Everyone I could've possibly asked was going to the wedding. All my siblings, my parents, my aunts and uncles, my cousins, my friends, everyone. On top of that, I don't have the money for a babysitter, nor would I ever trust a stranger with my son. The child free rule was extremely difficult to adapt to.\n\nIn the end, I decided I was going to bring my son and ask my sister if he could be the ring bearer, since I knew they didn't have one. I thought he could be quite helpful as he's a well behaved kid. Boy, was I wrong. \n\nWhen I got to the wedding, my sister blew up at me and said I completely disrespected her boundaries. When I suggested she included him in the wedding she got even more annoyed, and told me it was her wedding and that I didn't get to choose who was in it. She said I ruined her wedding day and asked me to leave, which I did as to not cause too big of a problem. \n\nToday , most of my family blew up my phone with angry calls and messages telling me how upset my sister was with me. However, my 2 older brothers and my best friend were on my side saying that she wasn't being fair on me. \n\nI don't see how i'm the asshole. In my point of view she's being a complete bridezilla, but clearly these people think differently, so I'm asking you, Reddit. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Or, talk to other guests with children and see if you can share a sitter they trust and split the cost.\n\nYou had options other than \"Surprise, you have a ring bearer now!\" It sounds like you felt slighted you were not in the wedding party, so you decided to do as you please put of pettiness.", "YTA you not only took your son to a child free wedding you also decided he should be given a special role in it.\n\nYou should have spoken to your sister beforehand and explained your situation, but, if you couldn\u2019t find childcare and your son still wasn\u2019t invited you and your sister would need to accept you had reached an impasse and you would have to miss the wedding.\n\nYou need to apologise to your sister for not accepting that it was her right not to invite children and not your right to go against her wishes.

He didn't have an outfit for the wedding that coordinated with the rest of the bridal party, nowhere to sit, nothing to eat, the other guests that had to leave their kids at home would've been upset that you brought yours and that could cause troubles for the couple.\n\nIt was just a bad move", "YTA.

Why was it a child free wedding with the exception of the bridal party and WHY was no one in HER side of the family included?  Can the bridal party not be held to the same standard as the rest of the guest list? They\u2019ll be occupied being part of the wedding party anyway!
