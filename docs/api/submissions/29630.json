It's a pretty clear ESH situation to me.\n\nOP - You're an adult and this is your son. He was out of line, but as a parent, you should be able to control yourself a little better in the moment. Throwing therapy as an insult when the events in question that are affecting him happened when he was a minor under your roof is not great. \n\nEven something like \"I get where you're coming from, but this is your sister. I will not tolerate you calling her names.\" would have been better. \n\nOP's Son - Very much an asshole. I get it, having been bullied I really do not think well of those who bully. But Sister is a teenager and teens are stupid, shortsighted, easily swayed by peer pressure, and they don't fully consider the consequences of their actions. She's young enough that this is a big learning moment for her. If navigated well, she will grow into an empathetic person. But to label your own sister a bitch and cut her out of your life for her actions as a teen without seeing if she's even *trying* to grow past it is AH behavior. Also, it shows you don't trust your own parents to properly parent Sister through this so she does grow. That may be valid, but since OP's son still talks to him, it seems like they have a good relationship so it comes off as AH behavior.\n\nOP's Daughter - she bullied another student to the point the parents got a call home.

As far as your therapy comment I understand because he called a child out name. This could have been handled by the adults better but your son does need to go through therapy or something.

Why didn't you help him process it?", "Since the trauma occurred when he was a child under your care that is your fault.", "This is your making, you should offer to pay for it. Like others have said, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.", "You failed as a parent back then and you are failing even harder right now.\n\nYour attitude is the reason teacher can't teach anymore. Parents will always fight for their kids even when the school system clearly sees what's wrong with them.\n\nYou are the rotten tree your daughter has now fallen of. Luckily your son is better than both of you.", "His sister should get therapy instead of treating other people the way she does. But apparently that isn\u2019t a problem.", "Yet it was your duty back them, cause he was a kid. I see that you don't like him very much and probably neglected him.

That\u2019s the responsibility of the emotionally mature and supportive parent, which clearly you weren\u2019t", "Happened in High School. YOU should have gotten him therapy.  Your children have learned abhorrent behavior from their parents.  YOU are an asshole.", "Yea trauma you failed to get him therapy for when he was a minor under *your* care.", "Why the fuck didn\u2019t you get him therapy. You\u2019re an asshole and shit parent", "You also need to take accountability for your lack of action when he was a teenager. He definitely should take his anger out in his sister, but it is perfectly acceptable for him to be angry at you- his parent- that didn\u2019t protect him at the time.", "That may be true, however you used a need for therapy as an insult and a threat - which would totally undermine any therapy, even if you had the awareness to get it for him years ago when needed.", "wow", "[deleted]", "so does op if this is how they react. i agree with yta/esh.", "Idk one way or the other, but OP left his son's age out, too. Is he in his early 20's or his he much older? Some asshole parents even consider their kids \"adults\" at 18 and send them off.", "How do we know she isn't? She is a bully so I'm inclinedbto agree with the son here.", "Considering things though, this could be a 17 year old minor, and a 20 year old man. 3 years apart and not as comparable for 'grown ass man' vs 'little kid'. OP conveniently leaves this context out.", ">OP also left out the sons age. I imagine it is something like the son is 19-20\n\nHe's married with kids, so he must surely be older than that.", "OP commented elsewhere that the son was in his 30s, but you have to scroll down a lot to see this. But still won't give us the daughter's age, which is shifty as hell.\n\nIt sounds like OP didn't take their son's bullying seriously (we don't know OP's gender either, so OP could be a father expecting their son to \"man up\", perhaps?). If they can easily dismiss their daughter's bullying, it's easy to see how they responded to their son's bullying. And you're right- a school would intervene and contact parents if bullying is a frequent occurrence, and if the name calling is significant. So why is it OK for the daughter to repeatedly call someone else some nasty names, yet OP's son used one lower tier insult and is villified for doing so?\n\nAlso to add... OP's son was bullied as a minor. It was OP's responsibility, as a parent, to take their son's bullying seriously, advocate for him, and get him therapy before he hit adulthood, so he could come to terms with his childhood trauma earlier in life. OP is failing both their kids. And OP's son has his own home. He is entitled to decide whoever can enter his home. It would be different if he was attending OP's home, where the daughter lives, and tried to banish her from her own home. But in his home, it's his own rules and if he doesn't want a reminder of his own trauma to be sat in his safe space, he is entitled to that decision.", "Name calling is something like \"you're stupid\" or whatever. Getting a call home is calling someone else slurs. Consistently.", "I didn't say that but the way that comment was written it does imply that he should teach her instead of talking to her like a brother does. I don't say he wasn't an AH, he was, I just don't think that he should be the one to teach her not to bully people.", "I prefer u no", "Maybe the school is very uptight and handles bullying pretty seriously at its root but I haven't seen one doing that and usually they do jack shit until shit hits the ceiling\n\nOp not giving the exact details of the incident and their dismissal of their son's childhood trauma until he was 30 tells me op is not being honest here", "Did I say I think she should continue to be held to the coals? I said I think it\u2019s too soon to determine whether she stopped in that instance only because she got caught and got in trouble or if she actually is going to be better moving forward. I\u2019m not even making assumptions on it either way.", "We only have OPs word that it's one situation. And as has been mentioned it's unlikely that the school would call based on one episode.", "nothing. most of the people in these comments are getting overly personal because of their own trauma. it\u2019s genuinely odd seeing people vilifying a teenager but giving an adult a pass to call her a b*tch", "Because if you\u2019re bullied you can never ever do anything wrong cause you\u2019re traumatised.", "Calling someone a bitch isn't bullying them lmao. Holy crap you people have no idea what being bullied is.", "you commented multiple times to say it's actually a big deal to call kids names because they might kill themselves, then in your last sentence seem to say that name calling is indeed not a big deal because they're just siblings and you've been called worse\n\nso brother is justified in name calling and shunning his sister and it's no big deal he calls her a bitch... because his sister is guilty of....name calling?\n\nnot trying to defend sister's bullying, i just think the brother shouldn't get a free pass to call his sister names if he's supposedly so against bullying", "Sorry your sibling bullied you", "And cheaters like witches", "I got in trouble when I told someone to \u201cstop being such an asshole\u201d oops!", "\"Sure, she's a nasty little bully who chooses to be a cruel person instead of acting like a decent human being, but at least she's not physically assaulting people on a regular basis, so it's really NBD. Besides, people kill themselves all the time\".", "Yeah, I don't necessarily respect what he did, but damned if I don't understand why he did it, especially if he's had no help up until now.

Kids are developing humans and very frequently mistreat one another - often in mutual ways. And much of what constitutes 'Bullying' to a lot of people is also perfectly normal behavior from a developmental standpoint. Most people mistreat others in the course of growing up. Essentially everyone does. Pushing against boundaries and testing the limits of what you can do and get away with is normal human behavior in that age range. If you are an adult who doesn't believe you ever did, you should be very suspicious of the accuracy of your memory. Few people have the moral high ground to say they were only ever victimized and never made anyone else a victim.\n\nSeems to me like this girl made a developmentally normal mistake that can absolutely be corrected like any other.
