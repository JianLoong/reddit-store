If you genuinely think your son would benefit from therapy, then this topic really should be approached from a calm and supportive angle, no matter how angry or upset your son might be in the moment.", "ESH - I don't think that's how you should respond to a person who needs therapy", "ESH - your son does need to work through his issues but that was most certainly not how you tell him.", "INFO\nHow did you handle his bullying when he was younger? Did you brush it off as name calling like you did your daughter?", "Bullying needs to be repetitive to meet the definition. If this was one incident it\u2019s an incident not bullying. If the behavior is repeated then you\u2019re in bullying territory and your daughter needs help too. Your son was out of line but if the school used \u201cbullying\u201d correctly, ESH", "You can't force people to forgive. I was bullied all through  school and high school.  I've forgiven but I can't forget. If I met these people now I wouldn't give them the time of day...", "YTA\n\nYou suck. \"Get some f\\*cking therapy.\" Get over yourself. You didn't protect your son then, and you fail to see his point of view now. The appropriate time for therapy was then. I feel very bad for your son to have a parent who minimizes his trauma.", "ESH. He clearly has unresolved trauma from his childhood that he\u2019s taking out on a literal child, so you\u2019re absolutely right that he does need therapy and that he oughta be more mature. There\u2019s no circumstance in which it\u2019s acceptable for a man in his mid 30s to call his teenage sister a bitch. On the other hand, you chose a totally unproductive way to address your sons\u2019 issues. The way you told him to seek therapy comes off more as an insult than being genuinely helpful. If you\u2019re actually concerned about your son, find a more reasonable way to frame your concern.", "What kind of a family talks to each other like that with curse words?", "YTA", "YTA/E S H except your son\n\nWhy the absolute fuck would you think THAT is the correct approach to make with someone who needs therapy, that you, as their parent, neglected to provide for them when they needed it, which was when the traumatic event was happening?\n\nWhy didn't you notice your daughter's bullying tendencies until you got that phone call?\n\nLiterally the only reasonable person here is your son, who hung up on you and refuses to be around tiny bullies in the making and the people who enable them", "ESH\n\nHe was completely out of line and chose this opportunity to use a very gendered slur. Some men very quickly resort to those.\n\nI think you could have been more sympathetic to his experience of being bullied. How did you handle it back then? Does he feel that you neglected him, and could that be part of the reason for his knee jerk behavior. \nMaybe ask him about it when you talk to him.\nDoes he feel that you are taking better care of her than you did of him?\n\nThat being said it's very human to attack when attacked.\nAre you both a bit hot tempered?\n\nI think you need to be the adult here and fix this situation between the two of you. You need to do that for him, at for you and your relationship and for the relationship between him and his sister. That's your job as the parent.

God forbid if in few years down the line will be HIS children doing some minor bulling. What is gona do? Kick them out of the house?", "I'd lean ESH. He was completely unhinged and he does need therapy. That much is true. But you are his parent and so it is partially on you that he didn't receive it when he was bullied.

Did you just make that up?", "The difficulty here is if this kind of behaviour is a pattern for him but you think the underlying cause is something that would need therapy to fix, then the behaviour is a symptom of illness rather than an active choice. When someone has a virus they aren\u2019t choosing to cough or throw up etc. Same goes for any kind of mental illness. Emotions flare up out of control and sometimes hurtful things are said- that is never something to be ashamed of, but it is something to make up for once everyone is calm and in a healthier place. \n\nTherapy is a medicine for illness, never a punishment for bad behaviour.", "You didn't shame his behaviour, though, but his trauma.", "HE'S YOUR CHILD TOO!!!", "\"Do not insult my child like that, it's extremely disrespectful\" and then peacefully bring up therapy as an option", "well if that\u2019s the nicest you could be it\u2019s really no wonder one of your kids is a bully and the other isn\u2019t speaking to you.", "What a terrible attitude.
