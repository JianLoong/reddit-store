You should have been honest with him when you found out, you should have told them you needed the removed, and you should have told him that you are asking Amy because you needed the touchy Feely affection.\n\nThat's another issue too.

There\u2019s nothing deeper there", "I think I found the answer to why you're married to an angry robot who hates you. It's right here, in the phrase \"has family money\". Right? You're trading a real, loving, caring relationship for a secure one. If that's your choice, stand by it. Don't make excuses as to why you're with him. Just say, he has money. People will respect you more if you're honest about it.", "Not saying anything is wrong with your husband. But there are things that is not fulfilling in your relationship. When anything goes wrong do you ever ask him for support?", "So he looks like a great person on paper... but he isn't a good spouse to you. I don't think you actually like each other that much, let alone love each other. He just sort of fell into this relationship and let himself get pressured into marriage. You've accepted that this is just the way he is. Maybe. Or maybe that's just how he is with you. \n\nBut clearly you both value and care about other things (career?) than each other. But one day, one of you is going to realize this isn't love. Maybe when one of you realizes they CAN feel that way about someone else.\n\nYou both might be great people, but you aren't great for each other. He doesn't even like your friends. He can't even pretend to care about your concerns or act like he cares about you, and he never initiates intimacy or affection. Why are you settling for this? It sounds unbearably lonely. For both of you. You shouldn't be at all surprised if he announces \"out of the blue\" that he's leaving, because clearly his heart isn't in it. Maybe it never was.\n\nMy heart hurts for you. It isn't normal to feel like you can't share anything personal with your husband. I mean, my husband and I tell each other about dental appointments or work irritations or.... whatever is going on. If you have to bite your tongue around him all the time, there is no emotional intimacy at all. It sounds unbearable.", "I don\u2019t understand why is he trying to punish you for this? The surgery was simple and you\u2019re fine now, that what would the only thing that matters to me. Just out curiosity, does he have an issue with Amy? That\u2019s the only thing I can think of to make him this upset, other than that maybe he doesn\u2019t like to be left out.", "Why are you with someone that isn't the type to comfort you, especially during trialing times? What would happen if you had to go through chemo, radiation, etc? Would he be supportive, or tell you that what you're going through isn't a big deal? \n\nIt's unsettling he taught you to not burden him with your problems, but gets upset you didn't go to him, when faced with an incredibly dangerous burden. No matter how big or small the \"burden\" might be, he taught you to not bother him. \n\nVery, very unsettling.", "Op, I had that problem with my spouse, and then I told spouse point blank \u201cI need to vent and talk, I don\u2019t need you to solve unless I ask for your opinion, ok?\u201d\n\nAnd then spouse worked on not solving my issues and just listening.

Lol.", "You know, I can expect him to do his half of the chores, to handle problems like a broken washing machine, to not cheat on me, to inform me if he\u2019s working late or going someone. The house is neat and quiet and there\u2019s nothing really wrong with our relationship.\n\nBut I can\u2019t expect him to comfort me through surgery or be worried about me.
