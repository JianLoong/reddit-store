I've been in your shoes, and let me say, being single is way better than enduring that simply because you don't want to be alone.

But you have very different ways of communicating love. You say he doesn\u2019t show you love in the way you want it - affection & quality time. But have you found out what type of love makes him most happy? - gifts? Words of affirmation? Acts of service? Deep conversation? Time spent outdoors together? \n\nMy husband is also very stoic and even tempered. Which is great, because I\u2019m an emotional whirlwind. But we talk to each other about what we need. And we ask what the other needs too. It\u2019s not enough for you to say that you tried showing him love your way and it didn\u2019t have the reaction you wanted so you just gave up. You need to not just tell him what you need, you need to ask him what he needs. Maybe something like a long walk outside, deep conversation & simply holding hands - is the type of activity that will fill both of your buckets.", "Jesus christ.
