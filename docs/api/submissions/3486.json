That\u2019s really important to some people. \ud83d\ude44. So they can have it. But then there\u2019s always a risk of ending up with a husband like this. Oh, and he\u2019s funny. Sometimes.", "I didn\u2019t know about his money when we married. Currently, we have split finances because I asked. He\u2019s annoyed that I have a job. I don\u2019t like the thought of begging him for money like I\u2019m a child asking for an allowance.", "Honestly? Because I loved him and wanted him to love me. He\u2019s genuinely talented and admirable. I didn\u2019t know about how he would be like after marriage. How passiveness turned to complete coldness. He turned from someone who would blush when I hugged him to someone who stares blankly and just expects me to hug him, to kiss him, to hold and comfort him without asking and to know when he doesn\u2019t want to be touched. I don\u2019t always know it so it feels like I failed when he gets annoyed.\n\nIt feels like I\u2019ve something wrong in this marriage because he has everything and I can\u2019t get him to love me. It\u2019s not a problem with him so it must be me. I\u2019m still happy in general, because I have a partner whom I can trust with everything but affection and comfort.\n\nSome of my friends don\u2019t understand. He\u2019s handsome and wealthy and that checks all of their boxes. I didn\u2019t know about his wealth. We have split finances because I asked. I didn\u2019t like the fact that I was expected to not have a job and beg my husband for a credit card or money like I was a child asking for an allowance. He still doesn\u2019t like that I have a job but I have pride in my work. He\u2019s handsome but I would be happy with any partner.\n\nMy husband know so much about philosophy and has a classical education. I find it fascinating to talk to him. He\u2019s very good at talking to people when he wants to. I used to find his moodiness adorable. But then it seemed he was not happy when with me and I wonder what I did wrong.", "She has said absolutely nothing but superficial aspects of him.\n\nAnd she straight up said her surgery isnt his business. \n\nIf he was doing something wrong to legitimize her feelings she would have had 0 problems saying it. **She is the distant one.**\n\nMaybe shes afraid of being rejected emotionally or teusting him to love her or whatever else, but she isnt even opening the door for him to come in.", "Read op's comments. It's really not.", "Really? Hates her friends, doesn\u2019t like her spending time with Amy. Doesn\u2019t want her to burden him with her problems- but is mad she didn\u2019t tell him her problems.  Only proposed due to family pressure. \n\nWhat part seems like a healthy connection?", "I mean just doing the bare min is not love that\u2019s hardly even a roommate. Also I said probably, I can only base this on what I have heard from OP.", "I think she said all her friends EXCEPT for Amy fawn over her husband. She says a few times that Amy doesn\u2019t like him.", "I think for financial stability and just somewhere there. This situation is more common than you think really. \n\nSome stay for financial stability, because they're afraid to be alone, they could have certain arrangements which means they can't just leave.\n\nThere are quite a few reasons.", "\"Hi, I'm doctor X. Your wife died during the surgery... The cancer surgery of course! Yes.... When removing a cancerous growth... No, the cancer didn't kill her, I just dropped a knife in a bad place, my bad.\"", "Ok I snorted. Well done", "Lmao!", "Yeah. She knows or fears she knows something about his feelings for her.", "I just find it odd he wasn't her first choice. Like there's a history. But either way sounds like there's head games going on.", "I'm not throwing it around loosely, there are varying degrees of autism and her description sounds like someone who could be. Quite frankly people are throwing around \"red flag\" without thought that throw guy may just be neurodivergent", "No. Because he shows he cares but in a non-traditional way. She spelled it out at the beginning of her post", "I wonder how reliable of a narrator she is. Husband obviously cares enough to notice and feel upset that she didn\u2019t tell him about it. She sounds like if she doesn\u2019t get 24/7 attention then she thinks her husband loves her less\n\nEdit: maybe attention isn\u2019t the right word... more like constant reassurance?", "Yeah this is the vibe i get. \n\nSevere insecurity resulting in her doing her best to alienate him/avoid leaning on him, even though shes married to the fool. She loves him but she only really views him on a surface level because she hasn't really given herself the time to be close to him.\n\nLast parts conjecture but the rest is in the pudding.", "Why are you with this man again?", "Because now *other* people know how cold and uncaring he is. It\u2019s one thing for him to put literally zero effort into your health and well-being, it\u2019s another thing if people *know* that he\u2019s a heartless asshole. That effects *him* and that\u2019s the only reason he cares.", "So why are you still with him if he doesn\u2019t care about your life?", "Maybe add this to the post? It gives important context.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure why you're with someone who is actively hostile to you. That's what you're describing here, hostility.\n\nETA: nvm, I see you've already explained this in another thread.", "Please don\u2019t ever have kids with this man", "Info Did you go into this marriage thinking you could change your husband into becoming caring?", "So he\u2019s a vampire?", "Agree. Maybe he has depression. Depressed people may not want to hear about other's people problems since they're already too burned with their own.", "Ok, I am giving you a soft YTA. You should have told your husband about the surgery. You also should get some counseling. I was married to a man EXACTLY like your husband. I didn\u2019t realize how cold he was in the beginning because we were so young and he was so busy with his demanding career. You spoke about aching for a warm partner and I felt that. Get into some counseling and find what works for you. I depended on other relationships (friends, family) for my emotional support because my ex just couldn\u2019t provide it (and didn\u2019t really want to be bothered). It\u2019s a sad, lonely place to be. I\u2019m not going to say to divorce him, but it also took a medical emergency for me to really see how alone I was.", "If you died in your sleep, your husband would roll over the next morning, get mildly irritated at the mess and bother then go about his regular day \ud83d\udc80", "How?

How do you build a relationship on coldness?", "This can\u2019t be real\u2026 every detail that comes out of your mouth makes your husband sound more awful, and you can\u2019t not realise. I\u2019m not 100% sure I believe this post anymore because quite honestly, your logic makes no sense, and then you add poetic licence by describing him as a beautiful ice cube\u2026. \n\nI really hope you are making this up though!", "Why?", "You didn't know he had money? Didn't you meet his parents before getting married? How long were you together before getting married?", "honey you married someone who checks all the boxes on paper but doesn't seem to be in love with you. This is a mess far beyond the Iranian yogurt.", "This line makes me so sad: \u201cI have a partner I can trust with everything but affection and comfort.\u201d But yet he expects you to provide him with those things. OP, I\u2019m not going to beat a dead horse repeating all the things others have said about how this is not normal in a healthy relationship (it\u2019s not though). I\u2019m just going to say, that I really hope you\u2019ll consider going to counseling to figure out if this is a relationship that really will work for you long term, and to work out why you don\u2019t think you deserve affection and comfort from your partner (you do)", "Oh honey, please see a therapist. There is so much wrong here and is incredibly sad to read your responses.", "I know that counseling isn\u2019t a be all end all, but you should consider it. \n\nThe fact that you assume that there is something wrong that you are doing, or that the problem must be with him instead of you is telling.  \n\nIt\u2019s not just a bunch of internet strangers telling you something is wrong, it\u2019s all your dear friends.", "Was he this exact same way from the very beginning and you just ignored all the signs? Or did he change later after years of being together?", "You should definitely divorce he's really abusive !", "Do! My kids are loving it even though they don\u2019t enjoy Star Trek. S1 is quite different as it was made by a different company who demanded a lot of slapstick comedy. S2 was made much more like what Seth wanted and S3 was incredible.", "And yh considering my edit. Your last sentence really echoes loudly. And it annoys me that I forget ppl don\u2019t tell the full context in these stories.

At least a mix of the two", "Your spouses money isn't a good reason to stay in a marriage.", "The red flag is for her behaviour and lack of communication, not his.\n And anyway a red flag does not become ok just because a person is neurodivergent.

Given him a way to \u201cfix\u201d a problem for you?

He clearly doesn\u2019t think of these things but clearly also wants to be there to support you (he wouldn\u2019t have been upset otherwise) but if you don\u2019t tell him what you need then how is he supposed to know?\n\nMy ex was a fixer too.

He wouldn\u2019t be overtly affectionate and wouldn\u2019t like to hear my issues since he couldn\u2019t \u2018fix\u2019 them. I had to tell him that there was no fixing, I just needed to be listened to or cry on his shoulder. I didn\u2019t attack him and was clear/reasonable in my expectations. And then I repeated myself, and repeated myself, and repeated myself. Until I hit my boiling point and took a mini break at my moms for a few days. That scared him enough to start looking at my perspective and start opening up. It took time with trial and error, but he\u2019s a great partner today. \n\nI\u2019m not saying divorce him, but I am saying start speaking up please.
