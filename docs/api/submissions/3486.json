You should have been honest with him when you found out, you should have told them you needed the removed, and you should have told him that you are asking Amy because you needed the touchy Feely affection.\n\nThat's another issue too.

This thing you just said is the biggest red flag of all.", "And the penny drops. Now I understand why you didn\u2019t tell him. \n\nYou do realize you have a completely different question to answer though. Why are you with him? He sounds borderline abusive at worst and at best a shitty friend.", "my husband is a very \"logical\" person whereas me is more \"emotional\". i tend to act on emotions and impulses, whereas he tends to calculate before acting.\n\nyet he is the closest person ever to me. always listens me and supports me even though he himself isnt a very emotional person. \n\ncommunication is an important part of a marriage. if you cant even communicate with him especially on an important thing such as a surgery, why are you married to him? \n\nsex? looks? finances?\n\nsit down and think how your life will be 10 years from now when all the material things turn into a routine", "In my experience there's a lot of misandry on this subreddit. Often a man is TA for no reason other than he's the man.", "YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS NOT FINE!", "So all your friends, except Amy, fawn over him, but he hates all your friends? Wtf is wrong with this guy. \n\nI say this from the bottom of my heart, you deserve so much better. Reading about your husband makes me feel truly sick to my stomach. There\u2019s something seriously not right about him. It doesn\u2019t sound like he loves you at all and is only fulfilling the bare minimum obligations to keep up appearances. I\u2019m not a redditor who likes to turn to divorce as the first option, but I really think you need to consider it. This will never get better, and your health with only decline with age. I dread to think what position you\u2019ll end up in years down the road. And it breaks my heart that in all those years, you\u2019ll have never gotten the love, affection and support you deserve. Please consider how messed up this is, OP.", "Amy is the only person in this story that has common sense. I'm 100% sure your husband doesn't love you. But he cannot dump you for some reason. Maybe its related to the family money. So he neglected you. He make it painfully obvious in the hope that you will dump him instead. And you should OP. But if you are ok with having a rich housemate that you sleep with once in awhile, then you do you", "Doesn\u2019t mean \u201cchubby men\u201d are exclusively affectionate or not.  Just way you say this is off putting to me. Not good vibes. \n\nIdk op\u2026 I think you need a reality check..:", "The more you insist that your relationship is fine, the more I see the \"this is fine\" dog engulfed in flames. Your marriage is not fine if you can't even tell your spouse you're having minor surgery. Your heart aches thinking about someone who actually cares about you\u2014that's not fine.", "Yes you can't change his character and so instead, you changed yourself by looking elsewhere for the support that you need. It is not enough wanting to be depended on, you have to also BE dependable otherwise it's just noise. He should be reflecting on why his partner chose a friend to be their person instead of complaining about it.", "He doesn\u2019t like your friends because they stand in the way of him controlling you. \n\nHe is worried they will keep telling you how cruel he is, and that one day you will believe them. \n\nHe is worried that they will be there for you if you need to get away one day. \n\nYou are in an abusive relationship.", "I wonder if she didn't, because then he would have been the one to take her, and he would not have given her what she felt she needed for aftercare.", "Exactly. Like hasn\u2019t anybody heard of different love communication styles before tf? It\u2019s about communication. This sub really be stretching the most sometimes.", "Kinda wonder from the post if she doesn't fully believe her husband loves her or wants to be with her. If that's the xase, it makes sense why OP would be confused why the husband would care about her surgery/cancer. It also speaks to some self esteem issues OP likely has. \n\nIf you don't think your partner would care about cancer and treatments (even if they are more minor/less invasive)... it's not a good sign. Do OP and her husband even talk? I don't live with my bf (but in the process of looking for places together) and we know way more about medical issues, procedures, or tough life stuff than OP and her husband seem to. Does her husband not ask about her day? Did she only marry this dude for his looks because they don't seem to be connected...", "It's normal if your partner is self centered or abusive. It's not normal overall, but it becomes your normal and you sometimes convince yourself this is the norm for most people so it's more tolerable. \n\nOP sounds like she married for looks. Charming is not a a perosnality trait and he seems like he's only charming with others? They don't sound like they're compatible on any level from the post. OPs husband may have just wanted a wife to make his life easier and she wanted to feel special by bagging the good looking guy even if they weren't a good fit. OP may care more about how she appears to other people than how she feels.", "Wonder if he just wanted a housemaid...the relationship doesn't sound more than that tbh", "Sure, but not telling your spouse that you're going to have an operation is a problem.", "My husband had a mole removed off his back because I thought it looked funny.

Now I understand, you married Edward Cullen.", "Either he\u2019s rich or has a huge d. If so, make your own money and buy a massive d****. Same thing from the sounds of it. Reevaluate your marriage and if he\u2019s this bad - have some self respect and get out.", "Sounds like she married him for his looks and he married her for convenience.  She said in another comment he fixes broken things around the house and does his half of the chores but he doesn't initiate any sort of affection but may reciprocate if OP initiates things.\n\nNow she has arm candy for a husband that's less emotionally supportive than a tree (and least you feel nice when you hug a tree) and he has someone to split bills and chores with.\n\nI'd call someone a shitty friend if they were this disinterested in their friends life and struggles. It's so much worse when its supposed to be your life partner :/", "Friend, your marriage is terrible.", "There is everything wrong with your relationship. Your husband does not care about you.

OP, he doesn't love you. And frankly, you don't love him. So far, the only good thing you've said about him is that he's hot. The rest is neutral *at best.* And a lot of it is straight up terrible. From the sounds of it, he didn't even marry you of his own accord but was bullied into it. And the traits that you love about him are... hotness. And that's literally it. Gods, go to therapy.", "so you have a friends with benefits situation, only you are married to your friends with benefits. got it", "How is he wonderful in your words \u201cmany other ways\u201d because all you\u2019ve said is a fancy ice cube who doesn\u2019t care for the emotional side of being in a marriage with you?", "How though? You've detailed ways in which you aren't compatible and he doesn't even do the bare minimum emotionally for your relationship (he'd honestly be a shitty friend with a lot of this stuff, and it's worse because he's supposed to be your life partner... I've given strangers more emotional support than what your husband gives you).\n\nAside from looking good and being charming (apparently to others but not you), what good does he have?
