I also gave birth to a boy who I placed for adoption at birth who is now 29. He had a good life and we communicated via a few letters for a few years before my younger children found out contact had been made. He did not want to meet us and I respected that. My other boys always knew, thanks to the help of a therapist who we worked closely with when they were young to find out the best path for them to be aware, about him but it was explained he was part of another family and might never join ours. This was the way the therapist suggested we explain it to them.\n\nThe boys read some of the letters and decided to write to him and say they wanted to meet. He let me know and I told my boys they should not have read my personal mail. My husband told them these are delicate matters and he had no obligation to meet us. The boys hated hearing that and said he was their brother and he should want to know them, and me, his real mom. We explained to the boys that his real mom was the woman who raised him and that his real family were the ones he grew up alongside and loved. We sent them back to therapy. But my oldest son did agree to meet us. We did wait for a therapist to say it should be safe (as in that my boys had clearer heads of what it would be like).\n\nIt seemed to go okay. But after five months of contact, we met his family. It was slightly awkward but my boys behaved horribly. My oldest has a brother and they hated meeting him and seeing them interact. We had to leave early after my boys started saying he wasn't his real brother and they'd replace him so he better go find his real siblings. But after we left my oldest said he would not ever want us to meet again and said that my boys had privately taunted his brother and insulted him and claimed his brother had stolen him from them (my boys). I apologized for their behavior and told him I was so sorry we had proceeded.\n\nMy husband and I were so angry and we grounded them for their behavior. They had their phones taken, their laptops and TVs removed and we had some very serious talks with them about their behavior. During this my ILs were annoyed that we were punishing them so severely for this. They said we should have been speaking to my oldest about giving his brother's a better chance and saying he should never have taunted them with his brother. They also said we should have been better parents and figured out a better way than harsh punishment.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692877727, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zzppt/aita_for_punishing_my_children_harshly/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You took the boys to therapy, you explained why your oldest may not want a relationship and they chose to ignore all that and lead with cruelty rather than compassion.", "NTA, sounds like they behaved appallingly, and they should be taught that there are consequences for actions like that. In this case, harsh punishment is exactly what good parenting looks like.", "NTA. It sounds like your boys have no respect for other people\u2019s boundaries - from reading your private mail to not respecting your older son\u2019s wishes and insisting on contact when he didn\u2019t want it. Your are correct that they did act horribly. I can\u2019t blame your oldest for not wanting to meet them again. \n\nYour boys need a lesson in respecting other people and their wishes before they cross a line with someone. And your IL\u2019s are completely out of line - your oldest obviously stepped out of his comfort zone for the sake of your sons and they acted like thugs.", "NTA. Your in-laws clearly feel entitled. Your oldest DID give them a chance and they blew it.", "NTA. Unfortunately your three boys are not mature enough to understand that just because you give birth to somebody does not mean that you are family with them. They most likely blew any chance they ever had of a relationship with your firstborn. And they have nobody to blame but themselves for that. If I was you I wouldn't even talk about the oldest anymore in any communication you have with him should be kept a secret from the boys", "NTA - yes they\u2019re struggling and definitely need to go back to see the therapist. Sounds like you took all the right steps that you could. But at the end of the day they know the difference between right and wrong. Bad behaviour has consequences and you\u2019re doing the right thing in enforcing that.", "Tough situation, but you were right to respect his decision whether to meet or interact with his family. Interesting no one is talking about the in-laws here. They seem to the AHs to me. Why would they inject themselves into an already difficult situation? And how did your husband react? Did he rebuke them and stand by you and your husband\u2019s decisions on punishment? If so, then good. If not, then he get an AH tag, too. \n\nBut one thing I have not seen in the comment yet is how you respected your oldest son\u2019s decision with grace. For that, you will be forever exempt from the AH designation. \n\nTL/DR? NTA.", "NTA- I guess I understand this on a different level because I have children I just reunited with from adoption. I agree your boys did not act their best at all. I would have done the same as you with the punishment. Because, it was their behavior that caused a wider rift between you and your oldest. Hopefully someday that rift can be repaired. They truly owe their brother and his brother an apology. But, they are kids and don't really understand the ins and out of adoption. Wishing the best for you and your family because I know that stuff hurts mama.", "NTA. You told your kids from a young age that they had a brother who may never join the family and had them go through therapy to work through it. They went through your personal belongings, showing no respect for your personal space or boundaries and then sent a letter to their brother without communicating with anyone, also violating his boundaries. You put them back in therapy before allowing them to meet their brother and they still acted like little bullies. They are absolutely old enough to know that their behavior is unacceptable and your punishments are strict but fair. They need to learn to respect other people's boundaries and spaces. Not sure what kind of therapist they were going to, but it does seem like maybe they aren't super effective?", "This is above reddit's pay grade for sure. NTA - for sure your kids were out of line. If they've been to counseling, why would they react this way? I'm questioning if they actually have been to counseling? Is the counselor qualified? Because this behavior seems like it would come from young children, not teenagers.", "M", "Yta. It sounds like you raised your sons to be little assholes and you probably didn't even discipline them for their actions. Even your oldest knew it wasn't a good idea but you pressed the matter anyway", "ESH. You didn\u2019t punish these little assholes harshly enough. A semester in military school ought to straighten the little bastards out.", "I mean...this is difficult to judge. On one hand, this mess is yours, so yeah...I think you are an arsehole, but not exactly THE arsehole.\n\nLet's run through events. Your kids find out they have a secret brother, they confront you about it and instead of having an open heart to heart, you get all butthurt, focus on how they found out, and send them off to a quack - for this alone you are a queen amongst arseholes.\n\nOf course, after the trauma of finding out, the trauma of your reaction, and the trauma of being made to feel unstable, they react horrendously to your secret child's well adjusted family dynamic (probably wondering why they don't have that). If they did the things you say they did, yes, they were little arseholes, but is it any wonder? Their reaction for teenagers is pretty understandable...\n\nBut are you reacting with understanding? Love? Any parenting skills whatsoever? Nah...just fucking punish them even more. \n\nI really hope you're ready for a lifetime of resentment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have to find a way to use reason and logic to communicate to your kids why their actions were not in line with their values.

So for adoptive kids and kids who know siblings have been given up for adoption. We spoke to him after this and he said they seem to feed off each other with the righteous feeling that he should be their brother. He also believes they have been holding back in therapy. Meaning holding their feelings back.", "They already knew that I had given a child up for adoption. They had known that from the time they were young. What they did not know is I had contact with him via letters. He did not want to meet any of us so it felt best to keep that from them. Otherwise I felt it would taunt them with something they could not have.", "Did you and I read the same post?

OP did the best she could to make an emotionally complex situation as safe for them as possible.\n\nHer kids responded by invading OP\u2019s private letters, deliberately circumventing the adopted son\u2019s wishes, and then treating the adopted son and his family like crap.", "\"quack\" though? you have an issue with therapy?", "Dude, her kids always knew about the brother. It's in the first paragraph. You completely misread this entire situation. She helped them understand that they had another sibling and that they may never join the family etc then the kids found her personal letters and wrote their brother against her wishes, who then agreed to meet her other sons. The sons behaved horribly despite their awareness of existence from a young age and despite the therapy they had to go through before meeting him. And they are all old enough to understand that their behavior is unacceptable.", "Maybe your kids just need more time before jumping into this? If your oldest wants to be a part of your lives after this fiasco, they need to talk more about their feelings or they will scare him away for good.", "Noted.\n\nMakes no real difference to my judgement though.", "Yes yes I see that now, and it does little to change my judgement. \n\nTherapy...fucking hell how Americans think therapy is the answer to everything is genuinely terrifying.", "He does not. He didn't want contact in the first place which is why I did not tell the boys we were writing to each other. The letters were occasional and more like a pen pal relationship. I think he felt guilt because of the boys ages so agreed. But he now wishes he had kept to his original stance.\n\nYou could be right. The therapist said they were ready but they were holding back in therapy and they've been feeding off each other.", "It totally makes a difference, or at least it should. You think her kids just found out, but they didn't, they've known forever. So there was no \"trauma\" of finding out. Which means their behavior wasn't warranted based on that. They've been to counseling. They reacted badly, and I'm sure that this family is talking about this, it's not JUST punishment.", "again I say, it seems you have an issue with therapy, amoung other things."]}
