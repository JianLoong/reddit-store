I also gave birth to a boy who I placed for adoption at birth who is now 29. He had a good life and we communicated via a few letters for a few years before my younger children found out contact had been made. He did not want to meet us and I respected that. My other boys always knew, thanks to the help of a therapist who we worked closely with when they were young to find out the best path for them to be aware, about him but it was explained he was part of another family and might never join ours. This was the way the therapist suggested we explain it to them.\n\nThe boys read some of the letters and decided to write to him and say they wanted to meet. He let me know and I told my boys they should not have read my personal mail. My husband told them these are delicate matters and he had no obligation to meet us. The boys hated hearing that and said he was their brother and he should want to know them, and me, his real mom. We explained to the boys that his real mom was the woman who raised him and that his real family were the ones he grew up alongside and loved. We sent them back to therapy. But my oldest son did agree to meet us. We did wait for a therapist to say it should be safe (as in that my boys had clearer heads of what it would be like).\n\nIt seemed to go okay. But after five months of contact, we met his family. It was slightly awkward but my boys behaved horribly. My oldest has a brother and they hated meeting him and seeing them interact. We had to leave early after my boys started saying he wasn't his real brother and they'd replace him so he better go find his real siblings. But after we left my oldest said he would not ever want us to meet again and said that my boys had privately taunted his brother and insulted him and claimed his brother had stolen him from them (my boys). I apologized for their behavior and told him I was so sorry we had proceeded.\n\nMy husband and I were so angry and we grounded them for their behavior. They had their phones taken, their laptops and TVs removed and we had some very serious talks with them about their behavior. During this my ILs were annoyed that we were punishing them so severely for this. They said we should have been speaking to my oldest about giving his brother's a better chance and saying he should never have taunted them with his brother.

You took the boys to therapy, you explained why your oldest may not want a relationship and they chose to ignore all that and lead with cruelty rather than compassion.", "NTA, sounds like they behaved appallingly, and they should be taught that there are consequences for actions like that. In this case, harsh punishment is exactly what good parenting looks like.", "NTA. It sounds like your boys have no respect for other people\u2019s boundaries - from reading your private mail to not respecting your older son\u2019s wishes and insisting on contact when he didn\u2019t want it. Your are correct that they did act horribly. I can\u2019t blame your oldest for not wanting to meet them again. \n\nYour boys need a lesson in respecting other people and their wishes before they cross a line with someone. And your IL\u2019s are completely out of line - your oldest obviously stepped out of his comfort zone for the sake of your sons and they acted like thugs.", "NTA. Your in-laws clearly feel entitled. Your oldest DID give them a chance and they blew it.", "NTA. Unfortunately your three boys are not mature enough to understand that just because you give birth to somebody does not mean that you are family with them. They most likely blew any chance they ever had of a relationship with your firstborn. And they have nobody to blame but themselves for that. If I was you I wouldn't even talk about the oldest anymore in any communication you have with him should be kept a secret from the boys", "NTA - yes they\u2019re struggling and definitely need to go back to see the therapist. Sounds like you took all the right steps that you could. But at the end of the day they know the difference between right and wrong. Bad behaviour has consequences and you\u2019re doing the right thing in enforcing that.", "Tough situation, but you were right to respect his decision whether to meet or interact with his family. Interesting no one is talking about the in-laws here. They seem to the AHs to me. Why would they inject themselves into an already difficult situation? And how did your husband react? Did he rebuke them and stand by you and your husband\u2019s decisions on punishment? If so, then good. If not, then he get an AH tag, too. \n\nBut one thing I have not seen in the comment yet is how you respected your oldest son\u2019s decision with grace. For that, you will be forever exempt from the AH designation. \n\nTL/DR? NTA.", "NTA- I guess I understand this on a different level because I have children I just reunited with from adoption. I agree your boys did not act their best at all. I would have done the same as you with the punishment. Because, it was their behavior that caused a wider rift between you and your oldest. Hopefully someday that rift can be repaired. They truly owe their brother and his brother an apology. But, they are kids and don't really understand the ins and out of adoption. Wishing the best for you and your family because I know that stuff hurts mama.", "NTA. You told your kids from a young age that they had a brother who may never join the family and had them go through therapy to work through it. They went through your personal belongings, showing no respect for your personal space or boundaries and then sent a letter to their brother without communicating with anyone, also violating his boundaries. You put them back in therapy before allowing them to meet their brother and they still acted like little bullies. They are absolutely old enough to know that their behavior is unacceptable and your punishments are strict but fair. They need to learn to respect other people's boundaries and spaces. Not sure what kind of therapist they were going to, but it does seem like maybe they aren't super effective?", "This is above reddit's pay grade for sure. NTA - for sure your kids were out of line. If they've been to counseling, why would they react this way? I'm questioning if they actually have been to counseling? Is the counselor qualified? Because this behavior seems like it would come from young children, not teenagers.", "M", "Yta. It sounds like you raised your sons to be little assholes and you probably didn't even discipline them for their actions. Even your oldest knew it wasn't a good idea but you pressed the matter anyway", "ESH. You didn\u2019t punish these little assholes harshly enough. A semester in military school ought to straighten the little bastards out.", "I mean...this is difficult to judge. On one hand, this mess is yours, so yeah...I think you are an arsehole, but not exactly THE arsehole.\n\nLet's run through events. Your kids find out they have a secret brother, they confront you about it and instead of having an open heart to heart, you get all butthurt, focus on how they found out, and send them off to a quack - for this alone you are a queen amongst arseholes.\n\nOf course, after the trauma of finding out, the trauma of your reaction, and the trauma of being made to feel unstable, they react horrendously to your secret child's well adjusted family dynamic (probably wondering why they don't have that). If they did the things you say they did, yes, they were little arseholes, but is it any wonder? Their reaction for teenagers is pretty understandable...\n\nBut are you reacting with understanding? Love? Any parenting skills whatsoever? Nah...just fucking punish them even more. \n\nI really hope you're ready for a lifetime of resentment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have to find a way to use reason and logic to communicate to your kids why their actions were not in line with their values.

It's in the first paragraph. You completely misread this entire situation. She helped them understand that they had another sibling and that they may never join the family etc then the kids found her personal letters and wrote their brother against her wishes, who then agreed to meet her other sons.

I think he felt guilt because of the boys ages so agreed. But he now wishes he had kept to his original stance.\n\nYou could be right. The therapist said they were ready but they were holding back in therapy and they've been feeding off each other.", "It totally makes a difference, or at least it should. You think her kids just found out, but they didn't, they've known forever. So there was no \"trauma\" of finding out. Which means their behavior wasn't warranted based on that. They've been to counseling.

And if so, limit contact\n\nNTA", "NTA.  They were incredibly selfish and childish, and bullying your eldest's brother was cruel.  They need to understand both that what they did was wrong, and why it was wrong.\n\nAlso, it was and is good that you respect your eldest's boundaries.  You sound like a good mother.", "You're in-laws have no say in your punishments. NTA", "Your children aren\u2019t going to be children much longer. One is 17, one is 16. Both can legally drive cars.

I am not sure whether harsh punishments are necessarily the best way forward - these are very big, emotive issues - have you been able to have your sons see the therapist further to help them process their feelings? \n\nYour ILs (and sons) are very wrong to characterize your bio-son's family relationship with his brother as 'taunting' your sons, and your ILs attempt to shift the blame onto your Bio-son is a big concern. I would suggests (subject to anything your therapist recommends) that you and your husband have a serious conversation with your in laws to make clear to them that your bio son did nothing wrong, that you are working with your boys to help them deal with their feelings over the situation but that their behaviour was unacceptable and inappropriate regardless of those things, and that you need assurances from them that they will not make any comments to or around your sons which suggest that their brother's relationship with his family was 'taunting' or in any way inappropriate, or suggesting to the boys that the punishment for their bad behaviour was inappropriate. \n\nUnless this is totally out of character for your in laws I would be considering significantly reducing what contact they have with your boys, especially if you or your husband are not around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know you apologised to your son but I'd also consider writing him a letter, apologizing aging, offering to reimburse his brother for whatever your boys stole , and letting him know that you will respect his wishes around any future contact but that your door remains open, and he is welcome to contact you at any time if he changes his mind but that you will not contact him again unless he expressly says he is willing for you to do so.  I would suggest that you also let him know that you have made it very clear to your sons that their behaviour was totally unacceptable and that you will also be arranging further therapy. Finally , I'd suggest letting him know that you would be willing to maintain contact with him without involving your other sons, if he wishes. That way, you are acknowledging the wrong which has been done to him, doing what you can to offer amends, and making clear that you will respect whatever boundaries he choses to put in place but are open to him changing his position in future.", "Nta I hope you realize your kids cannot handle this relationship. Please keep it separate no after what your younger kids want.", "NTA but your kids need a new therapist.  The way they behaved suggests that whatever the therapist is doing isn't working. Good for you for punishing them, with their ages they should know better.", "NTA. Your sons behaved terribly and they deserved to be punished. They showed an alarming lack of maturity and were needlessly cruel and abusive to your son's family. Your older son and his family did not deserve what they got from your kids and they are understandable and their desire to completely sever contact with all of you.

They have no place in this conversation about how you discipline your boys.", "YTA not for punishing them but it is you who raised those little shits", "INFO - Is your oldest son also your husbands son? or is he from a previous relationship?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso you are shitty parents. They need therapy, not punishment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey simply fail to understand how their mom could just give away her kid, their brother. Not that unexpected. They got to know a new side of your character, and have problems acceprting who you are - and that makes them act out.", "NTA.\n\nTheir punishment is light. They bullied someone for no reason, considering the fact that it's over something they can't control. Also, 17, 16, and 14 is old enough to understand the situation of an adoptee, yet the story tells us your children have a lack of comprehension.

Which one of your boys said your oldest son brother wasnt his real brother?", "NTA, god damn that\u2019s frustrating. Your only misdeed was giving them what they wanted.", "Info: how long are they grounded for? That absolutely affects my opinion on whether or not this punishment is reasonable. I'm generally leaning towards yes and you're NTA - but if they're, like, grounded until they leave home then of course not.", "Plus they aren't children they are all teenagers. 17 and 16 are steps away from being on their own to manage complex issues. I would expect better more mature behavior.", "Naw, this isn't an age or therapist quality issue, this is common between bio-family and adoptees.  Some people will never grasp that, for many adoptees, bio-family has zero meaning, and/or the family that they've always known IS their family.\n\nMy sister is adopted (so am I, but different bio-families).  Her mother found her, they met, and... things got awkward.  Bio-mom expected sister to drop our family in favour of \"real Mom\".   Sister had to get her to understand that, while they could have a relationship, our family was her family, no replacing it.  And that's an adult.\n\nThere's a reason I'll never do a DNA test or search.", "Going to counseling doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not gonna act up anymore or even straight up regress in some situations.", "I wouldn't have put that because that sounds like your blaming the adopted brother too", "They've had therapy.  They've been aware for years of the son's existence.\n\nOP has handled it exactly as it should have been handled.\n\nthe point they aren't getting isn't why Mom gave him up, they fail to grasp he has no interest in them, personally.  He feels no connection, and doesn't want one, and that is what pisses the bio-boys off.  this is them being pissy because how could he reject such awesome brothers?", "They had therapy and the older ones are near adults.

They aren't innocents in this and the person who most suffered was the brother who was adopted out.  \n\n\nHaving a reason for something doesn't excuse shitty behaviour.", "I was adopted by my Dad, so I'm in a half situation. I always knew I was adopted so there was no shocking revelation. I did meet my bio-dad when I was 30 and I didn't like him, he did nothing during our meeting but speak ill of my Mom. So I just didn't keep communicating at all, just cut ties before they were even formed.\n\nI'm sorry about your sister's situation, but please don't let it stop you from knowing your own history. You can know and not pursue any contact as well. But I get it either way.", "I'm curious as to where you went wrong raising those kids to have no respect for other people's belongings or wishes.
