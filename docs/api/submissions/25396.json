My other boys always knew, thanks to the help of a therapist who we worked closely with when they were young to find out the best path for them to be aware, about him but it was explained he was part of another family and might never join ours. This was the way the therapist suggested we explain it to them.\n\nThe boys read some of the letters and decided to write to him and say they wanted to meet. He let me know and I told my boys they should not have read my personal mail. My husband told them these are delicate matters and he had no obligation to meet us. The boys hated hearing that and said he was their brother and he should want to know them, and me, his real mom. We explained to the boys that his real mom was the woman who raised him and that his real family were the ones he grew up alongside and loved. We sent them back to therapy. But my oldest son did agree to meet us. We did wait for a therapist to say it should be safe (as in that my boys had clearer heads of what it would be like).\n\nIt seemed to go okay.

But after we left my oldest said he would not ever want us to meet again and said that my boys had privately taunted his brother and insulted him and claimed his brother had stolen him from them (my boys). I apologized for their behavior and told him I was so sorry we had proceeded.\n\nMy husband and I were so angry and we grounded them for their behavior. They had their phones taken, their laptops and TVs removed and we had some very serious talks with them about their behavior. During this my ILs were annoyed that we were punishing them so severely for this.

In this case, harsh punishment is exactly what good parenting looks like.", "NTA. It sounds like your boys have no respect for other people\u2019s boundaries - from reading your private mail to not respecting your older son\u2019s wishes and insisting on contact when he didn\u2019t want it. Your are correct that they did act horribly. I can\u2019t blame your oldest for not wanting to meet them again. \n\nYour boys need a lesson in respecting other people and their wishes before they cross a line with someone.

Your oldest DID give them a chance and they blew it.", "NTA. Unfortunately your three boys are not mature enough to understand that just because you give birth to somebody does not mean that you are family with them. They most likely blew any chance they ever had of a relationship with your firstborn. And they have nobody to blame but themselves for that. If I was you I wouldn't even talk about the oldest anymore in any communication you have with him should be kept a secret from the boys", "NTA - yes they\u2019re struggling and definitely need to go back to see the therapist.

Bad behaviour has consequences and you\u2019re doing the right thing in enforcing that.", "Tough situation, but you were right to respect his decision whether to meet or interact with his family. Interesting no one is talking about the in-laws here. They seem to the AHs to me. Why would they inject themselves into an already difficult situation? And how did your husband react?

If not, then he get an AH tag, too. \n\nBut one thing I have not seen in the comment yet is how you respected your oldest son\u2019s decision with grace.

Hopefully someday that rift can be repaired. They truly owe their brother and his brother an apology. But, they are kids and don't really understand the ins and out of adoption. Wishing the best for you and your family because I know that stuff hurts mama.", "NTA. You told your kids from a young age that they had a brother who may never join the family and had them go through therapy to work through it. They went through your personal belongings, showing no respect for your personal space or boundaries and then sent a letter to their brother without communicating with anyone, also violating his boundaries. You put them back in therapy before allowing them to meet their brother and they still acted like little bullies. They are absolutely old enough to know that their behavior is unacceptable and your punishments are strict but fair. They need to learn to respect other people's boundaries and spaces. Not sure what kind of therapist they were going to, but it does seem like maybe they aren't super effective?", "This is above reddit's pay grade for sure. NTA - for sure your kids were out of line. If they've been to counseling, why would they react this way? I'm questioning if they actually have been to counseling? Is the counselor qualified? Because this behavior seems like it would come from young children, not teenagers.", "M", "Yta. It sounds like you raised your sons to be little assholes and you probably didn't even discipline them for their actions.

A semester in military school ought to straighten the little bastards out.", "I mean...this is difficult to judge. On one hand, this mess is yours, so yeah...I think you are an arsehole, but not exactly THE arsehole.\n\nLet's run through events. Your kids find out they have a secret brother, they confront you about it and instead of having an open heart to heart, you get all butthurt, focus on how they found out, and send them off to a quack - for this alone you are a queen amongst arseholes.\n\nOf course, after the trauma of finding out, the trauma of your reaction, and the trauma of being made to feel unstable, they react horrendously to your secret child's well adjusted family dynamic (probably wondering why they don't have that). If they did the things you say they did, yes, they were little arseholes, but is it any wonder? Their reaction for teenagers is pretty understandable...\n\nBut are you reacting with understanding? Love? Any parenting skills whatsoever? Nah...just fucking punish them even more. \n\nI really hope you're ready for a lifetime of resentment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would suggests (subject to anything your therapist recommends) that you and your husband have a serious conversation with your in laws to make clear to them that your bio son did nothing wrong, that you are working with your boys to help them deal with their feelings over the situation but that their behaviour was unacceptable and inappropriate regardless of those things, and that you need assurances from them that they will not make any comments to or around your sons which suggest that their brother's relationship with his family was 'taunting' or in any way inappropriate, or suggesting to the boys that the punishment for their bad behaviour was inappropriate. \n\nUnless this is totally out of character for your in laws I would be considering significantly reducing what contact they have with your boys, especially if you or your husband are not around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know you apologised to your son but I'd also consider writing him a letter, apologizing aging, offering to reimburse his brother for whatever your boys stole , and letting him know that you will respect his wishes around any future contact but that your door remains open, and he is welcome to contact you at any time if he changes his mind but that you will not contact him again unless he expressly says he is willing for you to do so.  I would suggest that you also let him know that you have made it very clear to your sons that their behaviour was totally unacceptable and that you will also be arranging further therapy. Finally , I'd suggest letting him know that you would be willing to maintain contact with him without involving your other sons, if he wishes. That way, you are acknowledging the wrong which has been done to him, doing what you can to offer amends, and making clear that you will respect whatever boundaries he choses to put in place but are open to him changing his position in future.", "Nta I hope you realize your kids cannot handle this relationship.

It's not an excuse for them acting out, but punishment cannot be the only approach.

Your younger sons (who are all teenage and two of which are almost at the stage where most of the world would consider them adults) \n\n1. Invaded your privacy.\n2. contacted your oldest son behind your back, completely disregarded his and your feelings on the matter.\n3. continued to push until he agreed to meet.\n4.

You do realise that even before you become adults this kind of behaviour displayed here is frowned upon? You may related by blood but you are a complete stranger to him? Why be jealous of the established relationship he has with his family? If he hadn't rightly refused contact with you after your atrocious behaviour then would you have all turned on each other vying for his attention later on? If that kind of behaviour came out in any other situation (in the workplace , in a relationship etc) this could very well have been an r/entitledpeople r/antiwork or r/niceguys post. You're being punished as a result of your actions and how they affect others.

This may be complete conjecture, but it seems this push may be stemming from the IL\u2019s. Perhaps using the kids as an in to get in contact with the oldest. That doesn\u2019t really matter though. The boys are old enough to understand boundaries, even young children understand them. They were told multiple times, by multiple people that they don\u2019t get to dictate the involvement, and they didn\u2019t respect that. Losing privileges is not a harsh punishment it is a natural consequence of their actions.", "NTA, you did the right thing.

After all your talk of family discussions and therapy, they certainly should have had a more realistic POV.

Your actions all seem very reasonable, and your comment about how \"his mother is the one who raised him and his family is who he grew up alongside\" is beautifully put and so true. I think that's the biggest misunderstanding by your younger boys, where they have this idea that after almost 30 years of separation there should still be some innate brotherly or familial bond. How they got that idea in their head is beyond me, but that seems to be the root of the issue.\n\nI think the punishment was fair. These aren't 7 year olds who aren't expected to know any better. At 14 and especially 16-17 your boys should know how to conduct themselves and what is and isn't appropriate. \n\nI just hope your family can respect the adopted guys wishes and leave him in peace for the rest of his life. I seriously hope your boys do not harass him again or track him down. I hope they don't know his home address or phone number or email. And if they do harass him I hope there's even more severe punishments to follow.", "NTA. \n\nYour children are almost grown up, they really should know how adoption works and know how to behave. \n\nAnd this is a standard punishment and imo not overly harsh.\n\nAlso, tell your in-laws to stay out of it, it's none of their business and maybe that's where you children got the ideas from.", "NTA.

Your sons actions required consequences and removing toys, essentially, is the bare minimum.

IL's need to butt out. Sounds like your boys found a backchannel through them to apply pressure to you and that is also inappropriate. Sounds like IL's need a time out too!\n\nThere is just not one path for situations like this. When I (56M) was 20, my Dad (53M at the time) had a huge heart attack, was badly disabled and nearly died. One night, shortly thereafter, he had a few beers and admitted to me that I wasn't his first-born son. He told me that he had another son prior to meeting my Mom.  It was an extremely stressful time.  Shortly thereafter my parents relocated down south and I really just couldn't process the issue. I was too busy surviving. It is my understanding that this half-brother has passed and now my Dad is gone over 15 years.\n\nI never felt a compelling need to change my family's narrative.  My Mom is angry that I even was told, but doubtlessly my Dad felt I had a right to know.  But I also had a right to choose not to seem my brother out. I told my older sister about it and neither did she.\n\nI'd apologize and remind your oldest that his stepbrothers are young and request that he consider that if at some future date one reaches out to him.  It's really all you can do at this time.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA for the punishment you meted out for their behavior. HOWEVER, you ARE TAH for even taking them to begin with. They told you how they felt about him being reluctant to meet, and told you how THEY thought it should go, and how he SHOULD feel. That was a HUGE indicator that they didn\u2019t respect his feelings about the situation. And even though initially, you were trying to respect his wish for no contact, you REALLY wanted to meet him (which is understandable). But it was clear that they were resentful toward the adoptive family before you all had your meeting, and ultimately made their feelings known. As a result, they fixed it to where your adopted child will probably never want to meet with you again, and will most likely go back to no contact at all.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it was harsh at all. Their behavior was way out of line. Your ILs should not be involved in this.", "NTA Really simple here. Your house, your children, your rules. I also applaud you for dealing with something that is very stressful and wish my own mom had a little more tact between myself and my, in her words, 'real dad.' Not only did you deal with such a touchy subject, but your response was fantastic. this is not harsh, this is kiddy gloves. You could ban them from all after-school programs, ban them from games during school as well as field trips etc! You are fine, zero NTA chance here.", "Wow,  what a can of worms.\n\nI'm sure glad I didn't have to deal with this myself.\n\nI am so sorry that you're going through this OP.\n\nYou handled a difficult situation with class and grace.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour punishment doesn't even seem particularly harsh. I was worried you went to extremes, like kicking them out or something. Grounding them and taking away their electronics is perfectly reasonable.\n\nYou tried your best to explain to them, reasonably, what the situation was and why expecting a relationship was unfair. They are all old enough to have understood that.\n\nYour ILs, by the way, are complete AHes. In fact, given their reaction to the situation and in particular to the part about \"taunting\" your sons with his brother, I would venture that they have been enabling your sons behind the scenes.", "Sounds like the ILs have issues with OP having an older child that was put up for adoption.", "Very likely.

She was pretty adamant that she had no desire to meet them, nor would she ever consider them her family.", "My aunt is adopted and even at 50 years old, has zero desire to meet her bio parents. Which kind of surprises me, because my grandparents (her adoptive parents) are HORRIBLE people. We just learned that the reason she hadn't spoken to my mom in 5 years is because after an argument with my nana, my nana told my aunt \"your brothers and sister never even wanted you, I'm the only reason you were adopted\". My mom begged and begged for them to adopt my aunt when they got her as an emergency foster at one week old - my mom was 12 and desperately wanted a sister, and also let her live with my parents from ages 15-25.\n\nI'm not adopted myself so don't feel like I get to have an opinion here, but if I had horrible adoptive parents, I think I might be curious about the bio parents. But also kind of resentful like \"you gave me up, and I suffered for it\".", "I suspect that grandma dearest played a role in that, given that she is arguing interacting in a loving way with his adopted brother is a form of taunting the biological brothers.

Most of all THANK YOU for telling your other sons that his real mom is the mom that raised him.  This is the hardest thing for adoptees as people call our biological mothers are real mom, I have a good number of friends that are adopted and almost all of us feel this way. Your younger sons need to understand that they most likely destroyed any chance at having a relationship with your older son.  They went out of their way to be hostile to his family.  Stay strong in this, let your oldest son lead the way on any future contact.  Do let him know that the boys have been punished for this.", "NTA.  They needed some behavioral guidelines amidst this.
