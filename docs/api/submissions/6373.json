It was quite a long letter, longer than I thought. At the end of the letter I wrote that if he wanted to, we could have met to talk during Christmas holidays but that I would go back to my place ( which is quite far) after NYE.\n\nAnyway, among those who suggested me to write a letter, some thought I shouldn't send it while others thought I should. I thought about it for a couple of days and, in the end, I decided to put it in the mailbox of his work address ( I thought about sending it to his home but there is a chance it wouldn't reach him so I chose his workplace). I personally put it in there knowing he would find it the same day and I asked my cousin, who works with him, if he received it. He told me that he saw the letter but he didn't know how if he read it and that my father's behaviour didn't change in the next few days.\n\nAnyway, it's been more than a week since then and nothing happened, so I guess this is his answer.\n\nI had no expectation of an actual answer so I'm not particularly hurt or sad or anything else.\n\nI made this update mostly to thank the people who gave me advice on what to do and how.\n\nHappy NY everybody.", "created_utc": 1672750334, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1027ffs/update_wibta_for_contacting_my_father_after_14/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Really sorry to hear you've not heard back, but good on you for following your heart. It's not too late, he may come back to you, in the meantime live life as full as you can.", "Happy NY and I'm so sorry.     Best in this year ahead. You are a wonderful person.   I know that you have to believe that about yourself - but I wanted to tell you from redditland of strangers that you are a wonderful person. The broken one is your father", "At least now you know you tried everything and that will hopefully help you move on", "Thanks for the update. Honestly he may never reply, or he may be processing it. It took you 14 years to decide to write him and what to say so it may take him more than a week. Or he may just like his life the way it is in which case, as you say, you have your answer. My deepest condolences on the loss of your beloved Claire. I hope one day you open your heart to the possibility of loving again. Lightning sometimes strikes twice.", "Sorry he didn't reply.\n\nTake care.", "You are a great person! Your dad has alot of issues to put it nicely. Live your life and find mentors that can be fatherly figures if you need it. Some people are just shitty bio parents and so goes your dad. He will unfortunately probably turn up like a bad penny when he\u2019s elderly needing someone to take care of him. Don\u2019t take the bait. Let the stepkids do it. Many blessings to you going forward. Seek good therapy if needed!", "Damn this hurt!", "Let that loser stew in his loser family, you don't need them in your life. My chosen family makes me much happier and loved. \n\nNTA", "Well, that was sad.  But at least you had the chance to say what you wanted to say.  You've done your part and can lay it to rest now.\n\nNTA for sending the letter.", "I'm so sorry for you. But you have your answer. It's not your fault, and you were right all along. You father moved on without you. Either way whether he read your letter or not, he's the AH because why wouldn't he the minute he got it, or he read it and decided not to do anything with it."]}
