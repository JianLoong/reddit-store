It was quite a long letter, longer than I thought. At the end of the letter I wrote that if he wanted to, we could have met to talk during Christmas holidays but that I would go back to my place ( which is quite far) after NYE.\n\nAnyway, among those who suggested me to write a letter, some thought I shouldn't send it while others thought I should. I thought about it for a couple of days and, in the end, I decided to put it in the mailbox of his work address ( I thought about sending it to his home but there is a chance it wouldn't reach him so I chose his workplace). I personally put it in there knowing he would find it the same day and I asked my cousin, who works with him, if he received it. He told me that he saw the letter but he didn't know how if he read it and that my father's behaviour didn't change in the next few days.\n\nAnyway, it's been more than a week since then and nothing happened, so I guess this is his answer.\n\nI had no expectation of an actual answer so I'm not particularly hurt or sad or anything else.\n\nI made this update mostly to thank the people who gave me advice on what to do and how.\n\nHappy NY everybody.", "created_utc": 1672750334, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1027ffs/update_wibta_for_contacting_my_father_after_14/", "score": 333, "replies": ["Really sorry to hear you've not heard back, but good on you for following your heart. It's not too late, he may come back to you, in the meantime live life as full as you can.", "Happy NY and I'm so sorry.     Best in this year ahead. You are a wonderful person.   I know that you have to believe that about yourself - but I wanted to tell you from redditland of strangers that you are a wonderful person. The broken one is your father", "At least now you know you tried everything and that will hopefully help you move on", "Thanks for the update. Honestly he may never reply, or he may be processing it. It took you 14 years to decide to write him and what to say so it may take him more than a week. Or he may just like his life the way it is in which case, as you say, you have your answer. My deepest condolences on the loss of your beloved Claire. I hope one day you open your heart to the possibility of loving again. Lightning sometimes strikes twice.", "Sorry he didn't reply.\n\nTake care.", "You are a great person! Your dad has alot of issues to put it nicely. Live your life and find mentors that can be fatherly figures if you need it. Some people are just shitty bio parents and so goes your dad. He will unfortunately probably turn up like a bad penny when he\u2019s elderly needing someone to take care of him. Don\u2019t take the bait. Let the stepkids do it. Many blessings to you going forward. Seek good therapy if needed!", "Damn this hurt!", "Let that loser stew in his loser family, you don't need them in your life. My chosen family makes me much happier and loved. \n\nNTA", "Well, that was sad.  But at least you had the chance to say what you wanted to say.  You've done your part and can lay it to rest now.\n\nNTA for sending the letter.", "I'm so sorry for you. But you have your answer. It's not your fault, and you were right all along. You father moved on without you. Either way whether he read your letter or not, he's the AH because why wouldn't he the minute he got it, or he read it and decided not to do anything with it.", "He'll probably contact you when he's on his death bed so he can die guilt-free. Don't give him the satisfaction.", "Maybe he's just ruminating on what you wrote or maybe he's a bit mad and is wondering why you're contacting him now. I saw that you said in the previous post that he tried to call you once. I could've read it wrong though, tired I'm sorry. So... give it however long you need to make peace with it. If he doesn't respond in the end, well.. you have your answer and your dad is even more of a POS. Like someone else said here, if he's old af and tries to contact you, then it's probably so he can die without guilt. Good luck my dude", "I\u2019m so proud of you bud, good on you for following your heart. Hopefully your dad will pull his head outta his butt long enough to call you and express his remorse for not getting to know his kid the way he should\u2019ve. Wishing you the best!", "So sorry for your loss, Claire sounds like she was an amazing person. Good for you for contacting your dad, ball's in his court now and you can focus on getting on with your life.", "Glad you did this OP and proud of you.  \n\n\nI got in contact with a couple of my half siblings 2 years ago. They also broke with our father but only did so recently. He abandoned me 23 years ago.   \nFor 1.5 years I played with the idea to contact him and have one final conversation.   \n\n\nHe died in october last year. On thursday I heard he might be dying and friday morning he was dead. One of his final wishes was that the children he abandoned couldn't say goodbye and were not invited for his funeral ceremony. \n\nThat gave me some closure as it was clear how he thought about us.", "At least you put it out there. I have a somewhat okay relationship with my dad, but it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been choosing to ignore the hurtful things he\u2019s done. I wish I had the strength to tell him to stop or to cut him off, but I don\u2019t want to lose him too now that my moms gone. I commend you for following your heart and speaking your mind, regardless of what the consequences/reactions were. Best of luck to you friend, and hope 2023 treats you well.", "This is one of the bravest and most powerful things a person can do. I want to congratulate you for taking that step, for being vulnerable, and finding a road to closure. If you didn't do it, it would always hang over your head for the rest of your life. But unlike your father, you were courageous enough to speak and share. In this one act, you've shown yourself to be the better person.", "Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. I'm glad you took the chance, and I hope that this gives you some closure.\n\nYou seem like a wonderful person, and the only one missing out here is your dad. Happy New Year; may it be the best one yet. <3", "You sent it to his WORK.. during the holidays\u2026it may not have arrived yet . It may be in a pile on his desk or in a mail cubby\u2026 you don\u2019t even know if has vacation time right now ..", "Info: Does your sister know about the letter?", "THIS right here. You've done your part. Now just let things be. Dad is likely thinking things through and he's probably going through a lot of mixed feelings which I'll bet include quite a bit of guilt and shame. He may or may not reach out to you - but at least he knows how you feel.  Happy new year!", "**100% THIS** - do not ever give him the satisfaction OP.\n\nHe will come crawling when he\u2019s ill or dying, like the slimy creep he is.", "yes, he tried calling me on the phone once, few months after he went NC 13 years ago.", "Right in the soft bits this morning!\n\nOP I went LC with my dad a long time ago. He loves me, but just loves my older brothers more and it hurts. I can't imagine how losing your girl on top of that must be compounding your pain. I hope you heal and find love again.", "I'm sorry for your loss and best of luck for 2023"]}
