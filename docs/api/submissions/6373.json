It was quite a long letter, longer than I thought. At the end of the letter I wrote that if he wanted to, we could have met to talk during Christmas holidays but that I would go back to my place ( which is quite far) after NYE.\n\nAnyway, among those who suggested me to write a letter, some thought I shouldn't send it while others thought I should. I thought about it for a couple of days and, in the end, I decided to put it in the mailbox of his work address ( I thought about sending it to his home but there is a chance it wouldn't reach him so I chose his workplace). I personally put it in there knowing he would find it the same day and I asked my cousin, who works with him, if he received it. He told me that he saw the letter but he didn't know how if he read it and that my father's behaviour didn't change in the next few days.\n\nAnyway, it's been more than a week since then and nothing happened, so I guess this is his answer.\n\nI had no expectation of an actual answer so I'm not particularly hurt or sad or anything else.\n\nI made this update mostly to thank the people who gave me advice on what to do and how.\n\nHappy NY everybody.", "created_utc": 1672750334, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1027ffs/update_wibta_for_contacting_my_father_after_14/", "score": 2125, "replies": ["Really sorry to hear you've not heard back, but good on you for following your heart.

I know that you have to believe that about yourself - but I wanted to tell you from redditland of strangers that you are a wonderful person. The broken one is your father", "At least now you know you tried everything and that will hopefully help you move on", "Thanks for the update. Honestly he may never reply, or he may be processing it. It took you 14 years to decide to write him and what to say so it may take him more than a week. Or he may just like his life the way it is in which case, as you say, you have your answer. My deepest condolences on the loss of your beloved Claire. I hope one day you open your heart to the possibility of loving again. Lightning sometimes strikes twice.", "Sorry he didn't reply.\n\nTake care.", "You are a great person! Your dad has alot of issues to put it nicely. Live your life and find mentors that can be fatherly figures if you need it. Some people are just shitty bio parents and so goes your dad. He will unfortunately probably turn up like a bad penny when he\u2019s elderly needing someone to take care of him. Don\u2019t take the bait. Let the stepkids do it. Many blessings to you going forward. Seek good therapy if needed!", "Damn this hurt!", "Let that loser stew in his loser family, you don't need them in your life. My chosen family makes me much happier and loved. \n\nNTA", "Well, that was sad.  But at least you had the chance to say what you wanted to say.  You've done your part and can lay it to rest now.\n\nNTA for sending the letter.", "I'm so sorry for you. But you have your answer. It's not your fault, and you were right all along. You father moved on without you. Either way whether he read your letter or not, he's the AH because why wouldn't he the minute he got it, or he read it and decided not to do anything with it.", "He'll probably contact you when he's on his death bed so he can die guilt-free. Don't give him the satisfaction.", "Maybe he's just ruminating on what you wrote or maybe he's a bit mad and is wondering why you're contacting him now. I saw that you said in the previous post that he tried to call you once. I could've read it wrong though, tired I'm sorry. So... give it however long you need to make peace with it. If he doesn't respond in the end, well.. you have your answer and your dad is even more of a POS. Like someone else said here, if he's old af and tries to contact you, then it's probably so he can die without guilt. Good luck my dude", "I\u2019m so proud of you bud, good on you for following your heart. Hopefully your dad will pull his head outta his butt long enough to call you and express his remorse for not getting to know his kid the way he should\u2019ve. Wishing you the best!", "So sorry for your loss, Claire sounds like she was an amazing person. Good for you for contacting your dad, ball's in his court now and you can focus on getting on with your life.", "Glad you did this OP and proud of you.  \n\n\nI got in contact with a couple of my half siblings 2 years ago. They also broke with our father but only did so recently. He abandoned me 23 years ago.   \nFor 1.5 years I played with the idea to contact him and have one final conversation.   \n\n\nHe died in october last year. On thursday I heard he might be dying and friday morning he was dead. One of his final wishes was that the children he abandoned couldn't say goodbye and were not invited for his funeral ceremony. \n\nThat gave me some closure as it was clear how he thought about us.", "At least you put it out there. I have a somewhat okay relationship with my dad, but it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been choosing to ignore the hurtful things he\u2019s done. I wish I had the strength to tell him to stop or to cut him off, but I don\u2019t want to lose him too now that my moms gone. I commend you for following your heart and speaking your mind, regardless of what the consequences/reactions were. Best of luck to you friend, and hope 2023 treats you well.", "This is one of the bravest and most powerful things a person can do. I want to congratulate you for taking that step, for being vulnerable, and finding a road to closure. If you didn't do it, it would always hang over your head for the rest of your life. But unlike your father, you were courageous enough to speak and share. In this one act, you've shown yourself to be the better person.", "Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. I'm glad you took the chance, and I hope that this gives you some closure.\n\nYou seem like a wonderful person, and the only one missing out here is your dad. Happy New Year; may it be the best one yet. <3", "You sent it to his WORK.. during the holidays\u2026it may not have arrived yet .

You've done your part. Now just let things be. Dad is likely thinking things through and he's probably going through a lot of mixed feelings which I'll bet include quite a bit of guilt and shame. He may or may not reach out to you - but at least he knows how you feel.  Happy new year!", "**100% THIS** - do not ever give him the satisfaction OP.\n\nHe will come crawling when he\u2019s ill or dying, like the slimy creep he is.", "yes, he tried calling me on the phone once, few months after he went NC 13 years ago.", "Right in the soft bits this morning!\n\nOP I went LC with my dad a long time ago. He loves me, but just loves my older brothers more and it hurts. I can't imagine how losing your girl on top of that must be compounding your pain. I hope you heal and find love again.", "I'm sorry for your loss and best of luck for 2023", "Good for you! You got your emotions out, on paper, and sent them to him.\n\nNow *he* has all those emotions of yours on his conscience.  He can do whatever he wants, it's all his responsibility now.\n\nAnd you've let those emotions out, into the wind.  They're no longer taking up space in your mind.\n\nYou've closed that door behind you, just like Claire suggested.  I hope you go forward into this new year and think about things you want to try, places you want to go, and find things that make you happy.  That would be a lovely way to honor Claire's memory.  She'd like that, don't you think?", "That really sucks. 100% on him though. At least you can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t extend a hand and try to salvage some sort of relationship.", "I'm so proud of you for doing what you needed. I'm estranged from my parents, it was a different situation, they are abusive but to be honest the neglect and not feeling wanted was always the worst for me. \n\nI'm truly sorry you've not gotten the response you deserve. It sounds like it's not hit yet but I wanted to say that him not answering isn't a reflection on you in any way, it's 100% a reflection on him and his character. \n\nI'm also sorry to hear about Claire, I just read your original post. I'm so glad you have your mom and sister in your life, they sound like great people to have.", "I\u2019m sorry he never responded but good for you for trying to contact him and being vulnerable. That\u2019s the bravest and most beautiful thing a person can do. My condolences for your loss OP, that pain is awful and I\u2019m glad you got to a better place mentally. Focus on you and self care.", "That\u2019s a hard thing to deal with. My father and I stopped talking 9 years ago because he is very fundamental Christian and I\u2019m bisexual and married to a lady. He said awful things and I stopped trying. So I understand how you feel. \n\nIf writing the letter has helped you and you feel that you can process things better now, then that\u2019s excellent! If not, you may want to seek a therapist, because that will help a great deal with processing those feelings. It\u2019s helped me. Especially therapy types like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Gestalt therapy. \n\nGood luck, and hugs from someone who gets it.", "Regardless if he read the letter, I hope you got some closure in writing it.", "It's good that you tried.   \n\n\nBut yeah, your father is a failure of a human being for doing what he did to you and your sister, but it happens, I have a couple of friends whose fathers did similar things.   \n\n\nOne of them contacted him over the phone and all their father did was rant about their life and blamed the kids for never calling or coming over (even though he is the adult and father here), so these types lack any sort of accountability for themselves. It was good that she called him though, he died less than a year later from cancer.", "Not trying to give you false hope at all. But I\u2019m trying to figure out how you gave him the letter in the mailbox. If it\u2019s a USPS mailbox and you just put the letter in it is a possibility the post man took it out as you\u2019re not supposed to leave mail in the mailbox. But if it\u2019s a cubicle kind of thing where it\u2019s just the internal mailbox, then yes, I think you have your answer.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m really sorry. I wrote my step dad a letter after we became estranged and he ignored it for months. I moved on mourned our relationship and gave up. There\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll reach out and be ready to respond in 8-12 months. It\u2019s up to you if you are interested in it then. For me it was too little too late.", "Don't despair just yet he may have taken time off around the holidays and not received the letter yet.", "Idk, maybe he really didn't read it? Was your name on the envelope? Maybe he thougth it was some kind of store advertising or something?? I mean, even if he really was an ass I doubt he would be that indifferent at the workplace, but who knows. Has he ever asked your cousin about you or your sis in these past years?", "Even without an answer or a negative answer you have expressed your feelings and reached out, from this point on it's up to him, I hope that it brings you some closure.\nNTA", "I mean you said it's only been a week and this is a busy time of year. Either way I hope it all works out how you want.", "Your dad does not deserve your attention or love. \n\nSending hugs to you.", "You did the right thing", "I applaud you for reaching out. If anything this gives you a sense of closure that you were missing before.", "OP give him time, he may reach out to you. It isn't the same, but in May 2022 I found out who my bio father was. I am 32, and had thought it was someone else my whole life. My mother never told him she was pregnant. I found out about him and my half siblings through an Ancestry test and I contacted them in May offering to meet up in July when I was back in the states. I found out he had died, but when my siblings never answered I felt hurt and rejected, even though they never knew I existed. But I didn't regret doing my part.\nThey got in touch with me in Novenber. It had taken some time to process the whole situation. And now we talk everyday and plan on meeting soon. \nYour dad may need the to process. And you needed to have a chance to either open a door or close a chapter on your terms. You are very brave. And regardless of his choice, you have done your part to have closure. Good job.", "Feel good  knowing you put forth your best effort. You may still hear something.

There\u2019s a lot to say.\n\n As to your cousin saying he\u2019s noticed no change in his behaviour - that\u2019s not really indicative of anything - he\u2019s at work, at home may be a different story. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t discount anything yet.\nBest of luck whatever happens OP", "*HUGS*", "Remember that this is your father's failing as a man.

I heard from a relative that he did not want to have any further contact because 'it's all gone too far now'. I found out he had died - oddly enough - on the first anniversary of his death by Googling his name and finding a reference to his will. When I queried with his lawyer why I hadn't even been told, she said that it was his specific wish that I should not be. Oddly too, although he left me nothing, he left substantial sums to my children. Whatever. He wasn't a father or grandfather in any meaningful sense of the word.

I was fortunate enough that mine realized it when I was 23 and did all the work to make amends.  He knew he FUBAR'd and did the best he could at fixing things.\n\nI'll just say this - If it does work out and he reaches out, just keep in mind -  when there's emotions involved, don't expect that talking about something (especially this) is a \"one and done convo\", because it's not.  I hope for the best for you OP, I really do.", "u/EmeraldBlueZen This is good advice.  OP, you may want to just give this some time and let the chips fall as they may.

That hurt enough to never press it)\n\nHe was a moocher of rich woman anyway. He left this world riddled in debt stuck in his companies and \u201ccharities\u201d. It\u2019s hella sketchy. He was.\n\nI\u2019m ok with not having a final conversation or reach out I think. He was who he was. He fucked up a large part of my life and that\u2019s for me to deal with. He made that known from a young age.", "9 days isn\u2019t that long after 14years (plus the whole chaos of Christmas/new year period too, not to mention getting a letter in a mailbox at that time may have been initially unintentionally dismissed as a Christmas card to boot) \nI\u2019d hold off making final judgement a bit longer - it wasn\u2019t easy for you to write the letter and a reply won\u2019t be easy for him either.\nSpeaking as someone who had no contact with a parent for years too - it\u2019s an emotional minefield.", "He is a cool guy. We get along quite well.

But if you\u2019re processing your feelings and reflecting on what was said in the letter, Im sure a week feels like no time at all. \n\nBut OP definitely should move on. If he gets a letter, great! But he shouldn\u2019t hold his breath. \n\nAnd for me, personally, if I were to write a letter, it\u2019d take me well over a week to respond. I dont have any stamps and Id likely forget to get some. I once had to pay a orthodontist bill that, after insurance, was like $20. They didnt have online payment, so I had to pay via mail.

And you know that he read it (of course he read it). \n\nYou got your closure, and you got to let that all off your chest. And I'm so proud, and happy for you. \n\nIt's not going to be a feeling of huge relief, like you might have wanted. But it was still super important. And you did it.", "To be honest if he never contacted you, I wouldn't have sent him a letter at all, my father messaged me for the first time when I was a teenager if he never done that I would NEVER of messaged him", "I\u2019m sure this is disappointing, but in time it may feel like an overall positive outcome and I hope you can process it as such.\n\nI reached out to someone who had hurt me once to try to get some closure. The problem is, people who do terrible things don\u2019t often change, regardless of how much time passes; the reaction I got was almost as painful as the original harm, and I didn\u2019t feel the closure I had hoped for. \n\nIn writing a letter, you got to say everything that was on your mind, without interruption or distraction. In his lack of response, you didn\u2019t have to feel invalidated; you weren\u2019t manipulated into viewing him as the victim. You got the last word, at least so far.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that your letter had an immense impact. It\u2019s possible he set it aside to read when he could take the time and space to brace himself and absorb your words, and in the chaos of the holidays he hasn\u2019t read it yet. It\u2019s possible that this will, in fact, inspire some personal growth in him.\n\nIn the meantime, try to take this as your closure. You did what you could, you never need to wonder if he would have embraced you and become the father you once needed. And you, OP, no longer need him. You\u2019ve become someone who can love, who can process grief, who can acknowledge emotions and do things that challenge you deeply.
