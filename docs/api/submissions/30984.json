But anyways, we are down to just his vehicle because my head gasket went 3 weeks ago. I'm on maternity leave, as I just had our baby 5 weeks ago. Maybe this is why my tolerance is 100% gone. \n\nSince my head gasket blew, he's been having to pick up groceries for dinner after work. But he literally works right directly beside the grocery store so it's not out of his way and would literally take at most 10 minutes to grab groceries (we live 15 minutes from both his work and the grocery store). But as of maybe a week and a half ago he stopped going to the grocery store after work and just came home and would leave a couple hours later to go back to the grocery store, complaining the whole time about not wanting to drive (\"I'm so tired of doing everything and not having time to myself to relax\"). By the time I have finally convinced him to leave to go pick up stuff for dinner, it's almost 7pm every single time. Never fails. And it could all be avoided if he would just take the time to walk the 5 feet to the grocery store before coming home every day. \n\nWell, last night he gets home at 4:30. I specifically asked him earlier in the day to grab groceries before coming home but he didn't because he \"just wanted to come home\". He played with the baby for maybe an hour before I finally asked him to go get dinner because I was actually hungry for once (I've barely been able to eat since having the baby because food is gross to me right now). He said he would \"in a bit\" and sat down on the couch with a beer. 45 minutes later he got himself a bowl of cereal and sat back on the couch. So I grabbed the baby and his keys and just left to go grocery shopping myself and I took longer because I did a BIG shop so I don't have to depend on him any more. Maybe 30 minutes later he calls and asks where I am and why I took his truck knowing he doesn't feel it's safe for me to drive and I said \"I was done waiting for you. I was hungry, you didn't care so I did it myself. If you didn't want this happening than you should have gone to the store before coming home.\" He says I'm an AH for taking off with the baby without saying anything to him and that I should have just waited until he was ready to leave.\n\nETA: just to clarify, he said the power steering was going and that's why he didn't want me driving it, but the power steering was 100% fine. It drove normal with zero issues. I've driven his vehicle plenty in the past but ever since I had the baby, he doesn't want me doing anything or going anywhere. This is the first time I've gotten out of the house other than our babies doctors appointments in 5 weeks. The power steering was an excuse at best. The truck is in my name so it is not considered theft but it is his vehicle so do with that info as you will.", "created_utc": 1699980437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17v6e6h/aita_for_taking_off_in_my_fianc\u00e9s_truck/", "score": 504, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is a means of control.\n\nYour 'Partner' is also not concerned about your health and welfare, if he refuses to bring home food and makes you wait. This is another means to control you.\n\nYou need to create a plan B. An escape plan. Find a way to save cash in a safe place, know where your documents are.

You do need a better solution but right now you're reliant on him and he seems to be holding that over you.

Maybe look at getting a rental car or staying with family who will let you borrow their car. Something here needs to change.\n\nEDIT - I see elsewhere that the truck is actually yours, that's an interesting detail. He doesn't get to decide for you that you can or cannot take it, in my eyes.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry but it sounds like he's keeping you a prisoner in your own home! Not out for five weeks?

There won\u2019t be more work as a mechanic in the outskirts of major cities. He\u2019s acting shady as heck honestly.

You can get change in Florida, New York, Kentucky, Louisiana, Colorado, fuck even Texas.

Their is no way for him to know the exact limits of the power steering system when it has a leak or how long before that leak turns into no more power steering. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how you probably expect him to get the vehicle fixed/ maintained but you won\u2019t respect and trust when he says it shouldn\u2019t be driven.", "[deleted]", "Why do you need groceries every day?

Did your husband have access to your car at any time before it broke down? \n\nIt\u2019s extremely suspicious and convenient for your husband, who is a mechanic mind you, moved you away from your entire support system while pregnant, is lying about the only vehicle you have access to being unsafe, and you\u2019ve admitted that he seems to not let you do anything or leave the house at all recently, for your car to just happen to break down. Again with him being a mechanic it\u2019s even more sus that he hasn\u2019t fixed it yet. Is it at all possible he purposely sabotaged your vehicle? Knowing that would leave only the truck meaning he has more control over you?\n\nAlso it\u2019s REALLY odd and kind of sad that you were gone with the baby for a whole 30 minutes before realizing you\u2019re not home.

When you finally decide to do something for yourself that\u2019s when he acts like he cares about you. \n\nIdk it\u2019s all very odd and I really feel for you because a lot of this implies a controlling husband who will only get worse with time.

Maybe you guys should have a talk about going home\u2026\ud83e\udd37", "Can you ask a family member to come out and visit? Like a parent? So that you can not be so alone and get your truck \u201cfixed\u201d like he said.", "Well, it\u2019s a truck, so unlike a car, a truck (all trucks) are rear wheel drive, so the rolling power in a car is all in the front Wheels allowing forward momentum to carry you making it easier to turn the wheel regardless of having power steering loss. Although you would know from experience that even though you are moving forward in a car it does feel a little different not to have the power steering. On the other hand, with a truck when your power steering goes it takes a lot more forced to turn the wheel even at higher speeds. Furthermore, it is more common to have power steering issues that are intermittent. Meaning that one minute you have power to the wheel and the next minute you don\u2019t, which can cause real confusion in the strength you\u2019re using in your arms to turn the truck thereby causing an accident.", "Yeah, but it's a real big shock if the power steering cuts out when you're at speed. That is not a good or safe situation if a small correction should be enough to avoid an obstacle, accident, or take a curve, and you suddenly have to adjust. And OP said it was on the fritz.", "Even if the power steering were fully out, the truck would've drove fine and you would've been fine. Thirdtryisthecharm doesn't understand that power steering is just a quality of life improvement.", "You are NTA, but you should get back into YOUR truck and go back to Maine. This dude is bad news, and the quicker you break out of this isolation, the better. Please don\u2019t raise your child in this toxic and abusive household.", "She shouldn't have to call them, but he is an AH and not going. That's the point of the post.", "Did you read my other comments? Apparently not.", "If the truck is in your name, then you are 100% NTA.  Your fiance is very much the AH, however.  Your comments about him not really wanting you to leave the house or go anywhere since having the baby are extremely concerning.  You need to have a very serious conversation with him about this & if he doesn't change his behaviors, you should start planning an exit strategy.  Good luck OP!", "Girl, he has isolated you from any other support and stranded you in the middle of nowhere with no food. You are totally dependent on him.\n\n A man who gave a shit about his partner and baby would not have them stuck home with no transportation every day. What if something happened to the baby and you needed to get her to help fast? \n\nStart dropping him off and work so you have a vehicle. Do your own shopping. Call your family and plan a visit. \n\nAnd please- Consider getting some legal advice about going back to Maine with the baby and staying there. Maybe check in with a domestic violence resource close to you. Because this has all the hallmarks of abuse and I am worried for you and your kiddo.", "Technically speaking, you should get your baby and the most important possessions you have and hightail to Maine in your truck.\n\nPlease, hear what a lot of people here is saying: this is a pattern of behavior that is not healthy, he is conditioning you to accept abuse, he is \"bitching\" and complaining to get you to stop you asking him to step up as a father and as partner.\n\nTake your vehicle, go to somewhere safe (family if you can) and start caring of yourself and your baby. I do think your partner is too selfish and immature and it could devolve in a dangerous situation.", "That's a pertinent detail - you should add that to your post. I think the spirit of the response still stands, if it is 'his' vehicle you should get his permission BUT if he's withholding that and preventing you from having what you need, your action of taking it for an errand was 100% reasonable.", "I beg to differ. I have had power steering go out in a vehicle I was driving. She says the power steering is \u201cgoing\u201d, not gone, so it could unexpectedly completely go out while she is driving. That\u2019s what happened to me in a big, heavy vehicle. I didn\u2019t have the strength to turn it in anything but an angle. Depending on the road, the traffic, and the strength of the driver that can be hazardous. Had I known there was no power steering, I might have been more cautious or planned in case I had to suddenly move to the side - for instance if a car was coming at me from front or side, but I didn\u2019t And someone pulled out from a side street to my right that I couldn\u2019t see because of the position of a truck in the right lane. I hit the steering wheel so hard I broke it, broke 4 of my lower teeth off, some of my teeth on the right went through my lower lip, and the blow blew a gash on my chin that went all the way through. I still have scars. I might not have been able to avoid the crash even if the power steering hadn\u2019t gone out while I was driving, but I might have if I could have made a hard left.", "Friend\u2026..\n\nthis is _all_ wrong.\n\nCan you hear Whoopi talking? \u201cYou in danger, girl.\u201d NONE of this sounds reasonable, respectful, or safe.", "Find someone near you to check it out. Without him. I don\u2019t trust his word, since he seems to want you isolated.", "I bet head gasket was fine too", "And the question about fixing *your* car?\n\nAnd, if he's a mechanic, it means he knows if the power steering is about to go more than you would, unless you are also a mechanic.", "What a wanker! NTA", "I don\u2019t know how you fuck a man who throws a temper tantrum over groceries.", "I don't recall anything about him not wanting to shop for more than a day's worth of groceries. What I remember is that he doesn't want to shop after work. Maybe I misread.", "The messed up car is the one OP mentioned at the beginning where the head gasket blew which is why they are reliant on the truck", "You could drain the coolant, run the engine until it overheats, then refill it to cover your tracks. Overheating can wreak all kinds of havoc, so you couldn't rely on damaging the head gasket and only the head gasket, but it's usually the first thing to fail after prolonged overheating. \n\n(I'm not a psycho, I just know a thing or two about fixing cars.)", "Meh, just run it without oil ;) Ask me why I know? sadness. Check your oil levels regularly folks.", "You can overfill the oil, run it for a week and then drain excess oil.   This is another way to blow a head gasket.  There are a few.  Most would leave little to no evidence that it\u2019s intentional.", "Maybe he just told her it was the head gasket. Maybe she doesn\u2019t know enough to challenge him on it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yep for C-section I was told I couldn't by my OB.  I wasn't even out of the hospital til after 4 days with my first. I had to sit with a pillow along my incision to even ride in the car. Seat lap belt also would be along where that is. Minimum I have seen is waiting 2 weeks but it is large abdominal surgery. I was also still on pain meds for a while.", "C section", "The doctor that forbid me, said it was because if I need to stop suddenly it could pull stitches and cause a lot of pain.\n\nWhen I complained about it to a nurse about five weeks later in a follow up, they said it was for insurance reasons and best to get a doctor to clear me otherwise I'd might not be covered by insurance even if I wasn't at fault, because a lot of insurance policies basically consider this an exception that they don't need to cover.\n\n\nThe first two weeks I personally could not have driven, especially that first week as I was in too much pain regularly. But at four weeks it did chaff a bit needing to be driven everywhere and I thought I could manage it.", "Yeah I was able to fly at 3 weeks with my first but driving I was in way too much pain. It was very rough as I also had contracted Cdiff while pregnant. It also maybe different for each practice and patient to patient. My son I went home after 2 days instead.  I know they gave me a detailed list. My youngest was also over 8 years ago", ">For new fathers the hormones surrounding protecting mate and child sometimes get out of hand and the new dad can become absurdly overprotective\n\nSo starving his \"mate\" is protecting her?

To me OP's husband has the instincts of an asshole, not a protective and attentive father.", "If he was acting on instinct to protect his mate, he'd feed her.
