You deserve better.", "NTA but your bf is", "NTA. It probably started as playful teasing but if you asked him to stop then he should have stopped and apologized. You have a right to remove yourself from a situation you don't like.", "NTA.  If he put his hands on you as described (yanking), that\u2019s a giant red flag.  You deserve to be treated with respect and courtesy.  Run while you can.", "NTA. If this is indeed typical and he wasn't suffering from some new brain injury, RUN.

You went above and beyond to join him in this hobby and went out of your comfort zone to try something he likes. Rather than welcome you and appreciating you for doing that, he decided to gatekeep the car scene and be an AH all around. This is a textbook example of what\u2019s wrong with the car scene and so sad to hear. Find yourself someone who values your interests and enjoys sharing theirs with you, that\u2019s the bare minimum. \n\nSide note but if you\u2019re interested in car shows I\u2019d encourage you to go to another one with nicer people - most people in the scene are super passionate about their builds and are flattered when people take pictures or ask about them!", "NTA.
