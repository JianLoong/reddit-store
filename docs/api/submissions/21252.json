First off, I want to commend you for sticking to your guns in the face of overbearing family about teaching your daughter social values. It\u2019s so important. However, a year is a long time for a return on a punishment, especially since a year for a teenager and an adult are very different things; a year is forever when you\u2019re 15, and a blink of an eye as an adult. You verbally committed to not pay for any future parties, so that\u2019s what you have to do now, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she needs to not have a party at all. An option might be to allow her to hold it at your house if she pays for the food and drinks and takes charge of setup and cleanup. A compromise like that might help her to learn from the punishment and not just feel salty about it. \n\nSeeking forgiveness is also a deeply personal experience, and it\u2019s possible that the requirement that it be public may have made it too hard for her. Not that that\u2019s an excuse, I\u2019m just saying that when you\u2019re teaching a kid to swim, sometimes you can throw them in to figure it out, but some need hands-on help. Consider dropping the public requirement, and she may choose to apologize on her own. Though at this point? I\u2019m not even sure apologizing is the best step forward because the friend has already moved on to another group. It might not be worth it to bring up bad memories for that girl as the cost of teaching your daughter how to treat people.\n\nESH.

E.g. a popular brand of tomato sauce. Swap it for a cheap make. Start changing things to force her to interact with things that she perceived are beneath her.\nBut with Foodstuffs - try to do it without her knowing.

(It ended up looking like a baby shower \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) It seems like your daughters friend group as well as social media may be influencing her too much.

She\u2019s 16 maybe make her get a little part time job so she has an appreciation for money. Also thrift shops and second hand are actually really cool. You can show her YouTube videos that show how people use second hand items in their life. These days people don\u2019t look at the future. Spending more than they can afford on weddings instead of saving to buy a house, taking pay day loans to go out to expensive restaurants. Using credit cards to purchase high end purses and clothing.

Your daughter treated her friend with huge disrespect, but you are now disrespecting your daughter in turn, making a power struggle out of it and expecting her to submit. I'm pretty sure the only lesson your daughter is taking from this is that you don't like her at all. I really hope that's not true, despite the awful behavior, and I really hope that's not the message you want her to take.\n\nAt 15/16, your daughter is almost an adult, but also still really needs your help and \\*support\\*, teenagers are often AH's when something they're legitimately feeling or dealing with becomes too big for them to know how to handle on their own. So a) you don't get to direct her social life and interfere with her relationships with her friends, those are hers to manage; but b) she still needs to know that you love her.  \nI would recommend telling your daughter that you want to start over. Tell her you were upset and surprised by what she said and that led you handle things the wrong way (yes, this is great modelling for your daughter, to see that people can admit they got something wrong and try to make it right!), and you want to know more about what made her react that way, how she was feeling. Listen. Ask questions. Try to understand her a lot better. That doesn't mean you don't get to be disappointed by what your daughter did and said, and you can tell her that. But make sure you make that separate from your love for her. But you might really be suprised by what she'll tell you if she trusts you're really interested in listening. And if opening up a space of trust leads your daughter to say that she feels bad about what she did, then help her find a way of making it right that works \\*for her\\*.", "When I was nine, I had a birthday party.

Getting my head out of my ass was the option, and it worked.\n\nOf course this won't be the case for every single person, but let's get real and not create another generation of entitled fuckwits. Please?", "I feel like saying it's too late for a 16 year old harsh and unrealistic.", "If she's this awful at 16 it seems the train has already left the station. I'd personally only allow her to buy clothes at the thrift store moving forward.", "Especially since the daughter couldn't even tell it was used at first! The girl who gave the gift is savvy with her thrifting, I like her.", "Just make sure grandparents don't have her over and throw her a party with her in on it.", "That sounds like a piss poor excuse that some people would tell themselves to feel better about their own bad parenting.", "Fortunately, OP and his wife are presenting a united front.  It\u2019s refreshingly to read about REAL parenting.  That is, doing the hard thing when it would be much easier to give in to the daughter.  Hopefully the daughter will learn and mature (after the massive tantrum I see coming).  NTA", "I love when my son thinks that.  I get to teach him life lessons.", "I\u2019m 33 now not 70. And I don\u2019t let stuff like this get to me. I just don\u2019t go out of my way for peoples gifts anymore. Something small or a life experience. And I don\u2019t expect anything nice in return.  \n\nIt\u2019s given me much peace in life.", "I bounced back. My parents said some people are entitled and some are entitled to joy. So I picked joy!", "Thank you for your kindness. We are still poor. My husbands family has money. But my family does not and we love homemade and thoughtful gifts. I like vintage things and my often finds a $3 vintage bag and I love it!", "She's a spoiled, inconsiderate monster, who has no compassion for anyone, much less people who are not as fortunate as she is.\n\nSomeone who behaves so egregiously, refuses to apologize, and then tries to get her own way by going around her parents has absolutely no intention of changing her behavior (she probably couldn't even if she tried).\n\nThinking a 16 year old will change at this point in her life, absence a truly catastrophic event, is more likely the unrealistic expectation.\n\nCheers", "The poor deserve better than having a teenager inflicted on them in order to be a lesson to her.", "Yeah, they do. It's embarrassing to be used as a lesson for a teenager to not treat people badly. It's dehumanizing, and it happens ALL the time.", "I grew up in a world like this. The cruelty and classism isn't always obvious until you step away. Once you do, it becomes clear how appalling it is, and how many people \\*need\\* to think this way to feel good about themselves. It angers me, too.", "I can easily relate to the cultural aspect of this family dynamic. For the sake of preventing your daughter from becoming a bad human being ( she\u2019s still young and can learn to be better) , could you and your spouse consider going low contact with grandparents for a while? To ensure they don\u2019t undo your work and lesson you want daughter to learn.", "That's unfortunate.  You can't educate your inlaws, so you can just tell them that's the way it's going to be.  You can tell your parents you share their pain, but you can't let your daughter grow up thinking she can act this way with no consequences.", "I would cut off from these in-laws and tell them straight to their faces \u2014 the reason why is because they act like trash people and to treat people that way is the true class-less act and that you and your husband are far too classy to associate with such manner-less people. Maybe they need an etiquette class or some such, but they\u2019re too far gone with their ill manners.", "I'm aware. They're also Bdays(Like a sweet 16) That she won't get again. \n\nI don't regret many things from HS, but not being allowed to go to HC one year, was enough. Either they learn the easy way with mom and dad, or the hard way in the world, where the world doesn't care your feelings are hurt.", "Ooooo\u2026even better. Spend the money to throw the other girl a birthday party.", "I wouldn't assume that, 16 year olds don't think things through a lot.   My daughter keeps lying about stuff that we always find out about anyways, and the consequence then is always worse than if she had just admitted it in the first place, yet she keeps doing it.  We're not enabling her lying, she's just... a 16 year old.  (The lies are things like \"yes I've done my homework\" or \"i've handed in my assignment\", and then the teacher will tell is she hasn't been doing it and she's 3 assignments late, making her have a miserable month of doing nothing but schoolwork to catch up, yet... she does not learn the lesson).", "Why are you assuming she\u2019s been raised on empty threats?", "You severely underestimate humans, and have a lack of interaction if you think that's the case.\n\n\nPeople change all the time, especially teenagers. I've seen people change in their 30's, we don't stop developing until our mid 20's. Most teenagers, and I hate to have to be the one to tell you this, most teenagers, are to some capacity evil. Many, if not most grow out of it. I remember a spoiled brat from my highschool, he was a bully and a wannabe thug. Now he's an EMT.\n\nWhy? Because people, especially teenagers, undergo constant change. And if you think it's too late for this girl, who seems to have great parents. Then I pity you, and (If you have children in the future) any children you have.", "What preference? Do they know the reasons why every person passes out food? Do you hand them a short bio with each sandwich? If a teen hands them lunch, do they check first to see if he/ she acts spoiled and will refuse the food if they are?", "Yes, exactly this. It appears that ship has sailed.", "Once you identify a malignancy, you remove it.  OP's parents are rotting his daughter from the inside out.", "If the apology is sincere and shows understanding of the pain caused, it can still have an effect on the apologizer. I\u2019ve received apologies from people after long periods of time, and it mattered to me.", "Yes. I guess what I meant is that this would seem obvious that it was forced. A forced apology shortly after the incident might not have saved the friendship, but for some reason seems like it would have more impact", "Well there haven\u2019t actually been any consequences yet, just the threat of one, so holding out for a year hasn\u2019t really been that hard.  That\u2019s the one thing I would say, promising a consequence a YEAR in the future isn\u2019t going to hit very hard.", "Yep - allowance cut off - tell her to get a job so she can learn the value of money", "True. Sounds like the daughter needs any kind of practice at shows of humility.", "100% right. Oh man... I'm not looking forward to parenting teens. This girl is seeing how far she can push things. If she gets her way, expect worse things to follow. OP seems like an excellent parent. It's not easy with everything going on to remember these things and stay true to what you said. Ignore the in-laws. True to form, they're being utterly dumb. Would love to see some stories about normal in-laws sometime.", "They mean OP's parents too", "they took away her gifts from her 15th birthday party and donated them, so there were some immediate consequences.", "You are adding in words that were never said. That doesn\u2019t view them as an object, that\u2019s a stretch lol. Seriously, are you their spokesperson? How many have you interviewed? Do they have a preference with who gives them something to eat or gives them any other help? No upper class spoiled teens allowed? Only certain people can help. Seriously, get a time consuming hobby.", "Who\u2019s \u201cno one\u201d? Two or three people on Reddit?\n\nYou should know that Reddit is not a great example of real life. It\u2019s an echo chamber for leftists. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here.", "Yeah, got that from context. But OP's parents are the in-laws to OP's spouse, so using in-laws and grandparents to differentiate is incorrect in English.\n\nNot that any of that is important.", "No, because it\u2019s really hard work and they don\u2019t get the respect they deserve for it. I\u2019ve worked in hotel housekeeping, and I\u2019m not ashamed of it. It\u2019s the opposite of this girl who thinks that she deserves certain standards for absolutely no reason. She didn\u2019t work for anything she has. She has no job skills at that point, so she\u2019s not qualified to work in many other places. You can exchange it for fast food worker, or retail if you want. Those jobs are hard, and suck as well.", "I agree that she shouldn\u2019t volunteer for homeless people, that\u2019s takes a level maturity she lacks but a service job may be a reality check. Not because we (decent human beings) think it\u2019s a bottom of the barrel job or see honest work as beneath us but people like her do think that and she\u2019ll get firsthand experience of what it\u2019s like to be treated by her entitled kin.", "Bro shut the fuck UP"]}
