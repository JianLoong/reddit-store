This should have gone way further than just donating her gifts. Now of course she expects this party to happen, because she has been taught that if she wants something her parents make it happen. So no I would no allow her to have a party. I would stop buying her this and that, have her get a job and force her to buy everything besides her necessities. Your daughter is almost an adult.

It\u2019s up to you how long you\u2019re in trouble for this. If you don\u2019t apologise, you are choosing not to have birthday parties any more. If you\u2019re concerned about how sitting at home in your room without your devices will look to others, then it\u2019s time to decide if that\u2019s more or less important to you than continuing to pretend you were right to act spoiled, arrogant and mean.

First off, I want to commend you for sticking to your guns in the face of overbearing family about teaching your daughter social values. It\u2019s so important. However, a year is a long time for a return on a punishment, especially since a year for a teenager and an adult are very different things; a year is forever when you\u2019re 15, and a blink of an eye as an adult. You verbally committed to not pay for any future parties, so that\u2019s what you have to do now, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she needs to not have a party at all. An option might be to allow her to hold it at your house if she pays for the food and drinks and takes charge of setup and cleanup. A compromise like that might help her to learn from the punishment and not just feel salty about it. \n\nSeeking forgiveness is also a deeply personal experience, and it\u2019s possible that the requirement that it be public may have made it too hard for her. Not that that\u2019s an excuse, I\u2019m just saying that when you\u2019re teaching a kid to swim, sometimes you can throw them in to figure it out, but some need hands-on help. Consider dropping the public requirement, and she may choose to apologize on her own. Though at this point? I\u2019m not even sure apologizing is the best step forward because the friend has already moved on to another group. It might not be worth it to bring up bad memories for that girl as the cost of teaching your daughter how to treat people.\n\nESH. I don\u2019t think anyone is truly innocent of wrongdoing here, but a compromise may help everyone to learn for the future", "INFO: would it even be logistically possible for you to gather everyone for the apology at this point?  If so than NTA, but if not, it seems like overkill to continue to punish your daughter for a mistake it's literally impossible to correct at this point.

You need to sit her down and talk to her about WHY her behaviour was inappropriate, and whether she's friends with that girl or not anymore, that in the future she should be lucky to have a friend that still tries to bring a gift to her party even when they're having a hard time. She needs to learn firsthand what poverty is and why initially her parents were willing to gift her things, that yes parents want their kids not to suffer but that doesn't mean it's okay to mock those who aren't as fortunate.", "NTA and absolutely stick to your guns on this.  She is a whole person and can make her own choices but you are doing GOOD to try and show her the consequences to her actions and hopefully when she doesn\u2019t get her sweet 16 it will start to hit home that being an asshole doesn\u2019t pay off.\n\nKeep up the good work", "NTA.

E.g. a popular brand of tomato sauce. Swap it for a cheap make. Start changing things to force her to interact with things that she perceived are beneath her.\nBut with Foodstuffs - try to do it without her knowing. So that she will try the foods first and realise there's nothing necessarily wrong with a cheaper broccoli than an expensive one from a pricier store. For example.\nThere's likely other ways to teach her not to only think about cost value.\n\nShe needs to learn empathy and the cost of humans caring for each other.\nDoes she only want a party to show off money and get gifts?

She\u2019s digging her heels in to get her way, and that should not be allowed. Good for you for being firm, and sticking to what you said.

NTA\n\nLike everyone else is saying OP, stick to your guns.", "Man, the less fortunate are not tools for disrespectful and entitled kids to learn from.", "Don\u2019t subject vulnerable people to this young woman, we can\u2019t be sure she won\u2019t insult them too.", "It's not a year long punishment, it's a year's \\*advance warning\\* that kiddo's behavior needs to improve or she doesn't get what she wants next year.", "I'm hoping missing her sweet16 would be the kick in the butt she needs to learn that this behavior won't get her very far in life.", "They're all still part of the same class, so yeah it's possible. She could apologize in front of the whole class, that would definitely include everyone who was at the party.", "She doesn\u2019t believe they will follow through. She thinks it\u2019s an empty threat.", "The grandparents are wrong here. You are doing the right thing.", "In lieu of your daughter apologizing, call the girl she insulted and offer to sponsor her birthday party and invite all her friends. Let the girl know that there are good people after all. If the in-laws or grandparents speak in your daughters favor, ask them if she learnt such behavior from them as they seem to condone it.", "Well, it seems you have found where your daughter gets her entitlement from!  The grandparents need to stay out of it.  Your daughter needs lessons in kindness, compassion and gratitude, not a party and presents.\n\nNTA.", "Time for a family and if necessary extended family meeting. Everyone needs to understand that it is not about choosing a complete stranger over your child it is about teaching your child right from wrong. It is about teaching your child about the dangers of bullying, making others feel less than, about embarrassing someone and  abound being intentionally malicious.\n\nIt a about raising a child who becomes an adult and is able to move through life with empathy and kindness. This world is a truly cruel and uncaring place we do not need to contribute to it.\n\nStand your ground. I do not personally believe in rewarding bad behavior. Your daughter needs to know that actions have consequences and that you are holding her accountable for hers. She still owes that young lady an apology and she also needs to know that the young lady likely moved away from he friend group because her feelings were hurt.", "You should tell your grandparents that your heart is breaking and this is very hard for you. However, you are willing to endure the hardship because it helps your daughter. You may want to engage grandparents to help you for two reasons: 1) the message to your daughter is much stronger if it comes from everyone 2) much less chance of them doing something behind your back. If you can afford you may also consider to donating the cost of party to the charity so your daughter knows it is not about money", "You're not choosing a stranger over your daughter -- you're choosing to correct your daughter's bad behavior instead of reinforcing it. You're choosing to be good parents.", "Maybe she didn't learn this in *your home* but I have an inkling that grandparents have a finger in this.", "Please don't confuse being \"family oriented\" with setting \"boundaries\". It drives me crazy when *family oriented \" is used as an excuse for everything from no boundaries to bad parenting.", "I think we found where the entitlement came from. The grandparents!", "That's a problem too. Grandparents are not end all be all. They had their chance. Advice? Sure, when warranted or wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. IF ANYONE, gives her a party or gifts. Do the same thing. Give them away and remind her, this will keep happening, so long as she has not apologized.", "I would say you are choosing your child.  A child needs a parent, not a friend.  Your putting your foot down to help ensure your child develops well", "Do homeless people have a preference who serves them food?", "This. There hasn\u2019t been other aspects of the punishment lasting all year. It was an immediate consequence (losing her other gifts) and a long-term consequence that she had the opportunity to avoid by apologizing to the person she hurt with her bad behavior, that\u2019s directly relevant to said behavior.", "Good on the other girl for leaving this group of girls and finding other decent friends. Sounds very hard on you as the parent since you didn\u2019t raise her to have this attitude. I hope it all works out and she shows remorse although might take a few years for her to grow up and realise her shitty behaviour, by the sounds of it. Sometimes at that age, popularity trumps all else", "I'm hoping your right. I had a friend like your daughter. She was jellie of me becouse evreone liked me even though I was not aa well off as her.\n\nI allwase wished her parents would just tell her NO. I think she would have done better in life if they had.", "Fair enough, provided the school would allow that.", "\"She said her best friend is getting a sweet16 party (not a thing in my culture) and how will it look if she doesn't get one?\"  \nShe is showing you she hasn't learned to value people more than appearances. You are doing the right thing for her in the long term, for your family's reputation, and for every person your daughter will ever related to in the future. Stick to your plan.  \nNTA", "Exactly.\n\nThis isn't about just that one girl.  It's about how the daughter treats people in general.", "Her moral development is already fucked if everyone but her parents think what's happening is wrong. They lost this battle because of the closeness of the family. She's being validated by everyone already.", "I do believe she learnt this behavior from my in-laws. They are elitist and look down their noses at those they consider lower-class [sic]. My spouse is the only decent member of that family.", "My in-laws do not listen to us. They are very elitist and see nothing wrong with her behavior. My own parents on the other hand cannot bear to see their only granddaughter in tears.", "That\u2019s not the point. Have some f\u2019ing respect. The homeless are not there simply for people to use to teach their bratty kids a lesson.", "homeless **people**\n\n**people, living humans**\n\nnot teaching tools for your life lessons to your kids.", "There is nothing stopping her from walking up to the girl between classes and apologizing. I don't expect her to make an announcement at assembly on the school speaker.", "When my daughter did something awful in high school, I required her to volunteer at a soup kitchen (charitable dinner service to the less fortunate). I asked her to contemplate her luck in having all the privilege and material goods others may not have while she worked.", "She's the reason she is in tears. It's an easy solution, all she has to do is apologize.", "She\u2019s not their kid. They don\u2019t have a right to access to her. Prioritize her moral development over the opinions of elitist assholes.", "Please don't make those who need the services of a soup kitchen your child's \"learning experience.\" That is demeaning and elitist.\n\nIf you want to instill actual values, volunteer with her, regularly, all year round. Thereby modeling the behavior you want her to emulate."]}
