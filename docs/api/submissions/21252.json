First off, I want to commend you for sticking to your guns in the face of overbearing family about teaching your daughter social values. It\u2019s so important. However, a year is a long time for a return on a punishment, especially since a year for a teenager and an adult are very different things; a year is forever when you\u2019re 15, and a blink of an eye as an adult. You verbally committed to not pay for any future parties, so that\u2019s what you have to do now, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she needs to not have a party at all. An option might be to allow her to hold it at your house if she pays for the food and drinks and takes charge of setup and cleanup. A compromise like that might help her to learn from the punishment and not just feel salty about it. \n\nSeeking forgiveness is also a deeply personal experience, and it\u2019s possible that the requirement that it be public may have made it too hard for her. Not that that\u2019s an excuse, I\u2019m just saying that when you\u2019re teaching a kid to swim, sometimes you can throw them in to figure it out, but some need hands-on help. Consider dropping the public requirement, and she may choose to apologize on her own. Though at this point? I\u2019m not even sure apologizing is the best step forward because the friend has already moved on to another group. It might not be worth it to bring up bad memories for that girl as the cost of teaching your daughter how to treat people.\n\nESH.

E.g. a popular brand of tomato sauce. Swap it for a cheap make. Start changing things to force her to interact with things that she perceived are beneath her.\nBut with Foodstuffs - try to do it without her knowing.

(It ended up looking like a baby shower \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) It seems like your daughters friend group as well as social media may be influencing her too much.

She\u2019s 16 maybe make her get a little part time job so she has an appreciation for money. Also thrift shops and second hand are actually really cool. You can show her YouTube videos that show how people use second hand items in their life. These days people don\u2019t look at the future. Spending more than they can afford on weddings instead of saving to buy a house, taking pay day loans to go out to expensive restaurants. Using credit cards to purchase high end purses and clothing.

Listen. Ask questions. Try to understand her a lot better. That doesn't mean you don't get to be disappointed by what your daughter did and said, and you can tell her that.

It's also why to me they are meaningless I'm convinced most of the time people don't mean it when they apologize.\n\nGenerally I don't value an apology I value that we don't trust the same scenario or behavior.", "If I could award you for this, I would.", "Does it really matter for ruining your daughter\u2019s sweet 16? She will never forgive you for it and hold it against you forever in the future. It\u2019s not worth it; find another way to punish her.", "My initial thought was you\u2019d be TA just based on the caption but you are NTA. Bullying is a serious thing and you can\u2019t allow that to fester into her character. She\u2019s at an age where every behavior has a huge influence on her (hence picking up the mean girl attitude somewhere). If you were to forgive this she\u2019d have no accountability for her actions. \n\nSUGGESTION: you could make it easier than doing a public apology since it happened over a year ago and you\u2019ve already punished her by taking the gifts. Aside from being a compromise in this situation I also think it would be easier for the victim. I wouldn\u2019t want to embarrass the victim any further by bringing up a hurtful time in her life in front of her peers just so you guys can teach your daughter any more lessons. Do it privately", "It was just a year ago that the daughter screwed up so badly. If it had been a couple of years and she had changed, then I would say you should reconsider continuing the punishment. But if you don't even follow through on your threat for even one birthday? That would be lame. \n\nI would say that if the friend dynamic has changed, then maybe the people who should be present for the apology might be fewer or different. The daughter should at least make a heartfelt apology to her victim.\n\nMore importantly, the attitude that your daughter exhibited is not a one-and-done issue. You need to do some things with your daughter to foster the attitudes and behaviors you think make a person good. Returning gifts and refusing parties are reasonable punishments but will not change the path your daughter seems to be on. Please take stock of your daughter's life, activities, and the people she spends time with. Your ability to shape your daughter's young adult phase of life is dwindling.", "Numerous-stock.    I don\u2019t know you, but I certainly do like you.   You are a very good person.", "Information diet for the grandparents sounds solid, and like a major/unpopular step to take in your culture. I'm sure you will be getting lots of pressure from family, so well done for sticking to your principles for your daughter's sake.", "> maybe next year id pay for it\n\nWhy? It's never too late for her to apologize.", "Sometimes people just suck, my friends brother is like the daughter in this story oddly enough the parents and the other three siblings my boy included are so nice, kind and humble still can\u2019t figure out why his brother sucks so much", "Why can't she just be the bigger person and apologize? I'm sure at this point via phone or email would do.\n\nShe isnt being punished the entire year, just out of principle for treating a guest horribly.\n\nGoing \"no contact\" because you insist on treating people like shit and not getting showered in gifts is pretty silly. Sometimes I swear this sub is a bunch of kids whose birthday presents are the highlight of their year.", "Was like 12 when I stole something stupid and got caught. My mom showed up like a hellfire tornado yelling at the mall cop to arrest me so I learned a lesson. \n\nCop apparently talked her down, but in the end my mom wasn\u2019t trying to punish me so much as scare the ever living shit out of me. \n\nIt worked, never pulled that crap again. Apologized  profusely to all parties\u2026She may be crazy, but she\u2019s My crazy mom and I love her for keeping me on the right track. Especially as a single parent.", "Daughter could stand to go without a cellphone for awhile, now that you bring it up.", ">This is probably trauma to the poor girl that could be affecting her life drastically.\n\nWorth considering that the other girl has put it past her and having her bully turn up to her door step is just going to unearth a host of bad memories.  OP really should be checking with the other girl and/or her parents first.", "yeah that attitude is disgusting! i\u2019m not sure the lesson will be learned though it sounds pretty ingrained and is just setting up fights. i don\u2019t know the treatment though how to gain empathy", "I was a judgy bitch at 16 personally. I found my footing after I got out of high school and feel awful looking back on how I was now. The social environment she\u2019s in right now, with all the judgy, edgy, materialistic teens who are learning how the world works and where they fit in it are clearly playing some part here at the very least. I\u2019m sure a lot of us can to relate to being shitty kids at least some of the time. I think she\u2019s got time to redeem herself but only if OP and dad stick to their guns and stay firm on this. If there\u2019s a hill to die on, it\u2019s this one, for the sake of her future.\n\nI\u2019m absolutely on board with having her get all her belongings from the thrift store henceforth though, that\u2019s a great idea.", "Dude from personal experience it may not be", "May I assume that it's based on the caste system? \nStick to your guns.  You're doing the right thing.  \n Caste has led to the destruction and suppression of many beautiful minds because they were told that they weren't worthy.", "\"Happiness is a large and loving family... in a city far away\"", "Alt account?", "Sometimes you just don't have a proper village available to you, and that's okay. 2 parents that are kind and loving is enough, even just 1 single parent would be better than having people like that around a child.", "That\u2019s a great mom!  I\u2019d let her live with me, too.", "Intentions do no matter when helping the less fortunate as long as you're not bringing any negativity towards them. That's why I hate the sentiment that people on social media shouldn't record themselves helping others just because they themselves make money off of it. That doesn't matter one bit as long as they money goes towards further helping others."]}
