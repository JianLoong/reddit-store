Yesterday, I got my period and bought some pads. I left them on the bathroom counter in a semi-sheer bag, where they weren't even visible. However, my husband thought this was inappropriate and could make his friend uncomfortable, knowing that someone in the apartment is bleeding.\nI argued that menstruation is a natural process and should not be considered gross or dirty. Women shouldn't be shamed or stigmatized because of it, as this has historically caused women to suffer.\n\nMy husband didn't respond, but I'm still wondering if I was in the wrong for leaving the pads this way.\n\nEDIT: Can we get any feedback from males?
