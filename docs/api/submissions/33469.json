I was having finals so i was studying the whole time, I got really sick so I couldn\u2019t celebrate with my family or friends and overall it didn\u2019t even feel like a birthday. \n\nMy boyfriend decided not to visit me on my birthday because he didn\u2019t want to get sick which I respected but I was still sad about it. However he almost didn\u2019t call or text me at all the whole day. His excuse was that he was really busy but later I found out he had time to hang out with his friend which really disappointed me. \n\nAnyway the next day he decided to come over and give me my gift, which ended up being a chocolate fountain. Now for some this might have been a great gift but I have no use for a chocolate fountain,I never said I wanted it in my life and I don\u2019t even eat chocolate often. Considering the fact that I was hoping for this gift would cheer me up and be something nice, my emotions got the better of me and I just started violently sobbing while saying that I hate it. My bf looked kind of shocked and he was confused on what to do and he apologised and said he thought I would like it. He left soon after and said he can get me a different gift but I declined since my birthday already sucked and I just wanted to move on. \n\nMy sister told me I acted like a spoiled brat and an a-hole and that a chocolate fountain is a nice gift so I could have just sucked it up and thanked him without the scene. Im confused now if my reaction is over the top or was I in the right, I just wanted a gift that was thoughtful and had something to do with the things I liked. So AITA\n\nEDIT: I sent him a list of things I would like because he usually struggles with finding something I would like", "created_utc": 1703110732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18n6w4k/aita_for_crying_over_the_birthday_gift_i_got_from/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's like giving someone an ice sculpture or an easy-up. These are things that are nice and/or useful if you're throwing a party or a banquet for a group of people, but otherwise???\n\nAre you a chocolate fiend? I can maybe understand his motivation then (although a box of fancy truffles would be an actual good gift in that case), but otherwise, what the heck??\n\nThis is just another entry in the sad list of shitty, thoughtless gifts that people throw at their partners when they can't be bothered to actually think about what might be appropriate and appreciated. You even gave him a list. He probably saw this stupid fountain in the clearance aisle and decided this was enough effort. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't crying because you were ungrateful or spoilt, you were crying because your boyfriend was hanging out with friends on your birthday (although you were ill so not super assholey), was ignoring you and because he had a list of things you may have liked and got you a silly gift instead. You felt like he didnt care\n\nIt wasn't your best reaction OP, but I can see where you were coming from.\n\nAlso, chocolate fountains are gross, you need a bottle of vegetable oil to mix in with the chocolate so it runs. yuck", "INFO what do you mean he ALMOST didn't call or text you all day? Did he contact you or not?", "Info: Did you give him a list of things you liked before hand?", "NTA - I\u2019d have been sad too. Really inconsiderate and didn\u2019t put thought into the gift.", "NTA, serious a chocolate fountain... what was he thinking.", "So NTA- I bet the gift he gave you was a recycled gift that someone gave him. Who goes out and buys a chocolate fountain? So random.", "A chocolate fountain doesn\u2019t seem like a gift a boyfriend gives a girlfriend. It does feel like a gift a mom gives her son to give to his girlfriend though. I know I\u2019m severely jumping to conclusions but are you sure he even picked out the gift? It just seems wildly random. NTA BTW", "I mean, thats a pretty over the top reaction, but I\u2019m gonna say barely NTA and what is saving you that  you apparently gave him a list of things you would have wanted that he did not consider at all when he got you the fountatin assuming there was nothing of that variety in your list.", "NTA\u2014you had already had a shitty birthday, he couldn\u2019t be bothered (he could\u2019ve easily video called you to spend time with you) and ignored the things you would\u2019ve liked to have gotten\u2014you did all the work for him and he still let you down repeatedly. You\u2019re not spoiled or ungrateful or any of that at all! I would\u2019ve cried too! I\u2019m sorry, OP. I know it wasn\u2019t great, but happy belated birthday \ud83e\ude77 sending you a hug (also\u2026dump his ass)", "I honestly just want to comment on the weirdness of the gift. I love a chocolate fountain at a party (If I can ignore the thought of potential germs). I love chocolate. Fountains are cool. But the idea of giving someone a gift like that which has zero significance, the person has never hinted to wanting it, has never shown chocolate fountain amazement etc\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s such a weird choice for a gift! I assume it\u2019s a newer relationship because it really shows a lack of any thought. Granted the near no contact or care for your birthday also shows a lack of thought. Nobody makes stupid little videos or whatever for their SO for occasions? That has to be a TikTok or social media nonsense thing right?\n\nI\u2019ve decided to judge even though I wasn\u2019t going to and I\u2019m going with NTA, I think it was an emotional blowout, not just about the weird gift. Consider the relationship as a whole before you decide what you want to do next.", "NTA.\n\nYou weren't acting spoiltbor ungrateful you were upset about your bf not having time to call you but having time to go out with friends and then gifting you a not thoughtful gift. It's not like he's known you since yesterday and would have believed you love chocolate so much you'd actually have use for a chocolate fountain that takes a lot of space and is awful to clean if ever used", "NTA in what world is a chocolate fountain a good gift? Even your sister is TA for saying that", "ESH\n\nYeah - bf sucks. Could\u2019ve handled much better - both with the shitty gift and ghosting you on your bday. Total dick move. And clueless on the gift giving, although, tbf, I can see him going into a department store and asking a clerk what to get his 20yo gf would like and they picked that. On the other hand, not particularly shocking behavior for a 20yo so either cut him some slack or cut him loose.\n\nNow, violently sobbing and telling him how much you hate it when he clearly thought you\u2019d be ok with the gift. That\u2019s likely sending out just as many red flags to him as his behavior did to you. That\u2019s some scary ass shit to pull if you haven\u2019t been together more than 8+ months.\n\nI\u2019d step back from the whole thing, take a deep breadth after you feel better, and just ask for a birthday do-over. He takes you out to eat, buys a gift off your list, and you fall asleep in each other\u2019s arms and move past this young lover\u2019s drama.\n\nOr, if everyone\u2019s still pissed off and you can\u2019t let it go, just move on.

Not even your clueless bf who got you a chocolate fountain.  This story is pure gold.", "Eh, somewhat the asshole.\n\nA good boyfriend would know/pay attention to what you like and get you something you want, but at the same time you should be grateful for getting any kind of gift. It's understandable to be upset, but I think you should've kept your outburst to yourself and then had a talk with him. If he's not paying attention to you in the way you'd like, you should break up.", "YTA - and listen to your sister because she hit the nail on the head.  Everything she told you is true.  You owe your BF an apology, not the other way around.", "INFO: if you want the perfect gift, why don't you request what you want explicitly? People aren't mind readers. Just let him return the chocolate fountain and tell him what would cheer you up.", "YTA for whining about the chocolate fountain.\n\nNTA for being stressed and upset about everything else.\n\nIt feels like you\u2019re misdirectIng your anger here. Or focusing your anger on the wrong thing.", "YTA.\n\nTears are hard to control, so that's not the asshole part. But saying you hated it is a pretty strong description without a lot of tact.\n\nMaybe this is boyfriend's first serious relationship and he thought it would be romantic? Some people are honestly just kind of clueless when it comes to gifts. Yes, even with a list. Does he normally show you in other ways his feelings for you? That's probably what counts.", "YTA. You acted like a spoiled brat. You essentially gave a bunch of valid reasons why to not celebrate your birthday on your birthday, then was upset that no one went out of their way not to listen to you and come over anyway. You got upset your boyfriend made other plans after he told you he didn't want to get sick, why would you be upset about that? You said he \"almost didn't text you all day\" so you were expecting him to text you the whole time. He came to see you the NEXT DAY, gave you a gift, and it wasn't some sparkling thing you've wanted your whole life that you mentioned you wanted, and the gesture wasn't grand enough. He got you something he thought you'd like, and even if you didn't like it, you didn't have to sob and tell him you *hated* it. I would have left soon after, too. \n\nYou could have had a laugh about it and at least tried it out together.", "ahhh, kids and their emotions. in his defence chocolate fontaine is great gift in guy\u2019s head. and your reaction kinda offended him because in the moment he bought for you, he thoughts was only how cool it and how much you will like it. \n\nSo grow up and try to not make yourself a main character.", "Was it the best gift\u2026. No. Did your birthday suck? Yes. You can have manners though. It was quite an immature reaction.", "Learn to say \u2018thank you\u2019 when someone gives you a gift, whether or not you like it because as the saying goes, it is the thought that counts. If you truly don\u2019t want it, you can always return later. I am assuming you are young person so don\u2019t be too hard on yourself but learn from this. I think you should apologize to him, would you feel ok if your friend acted so rude, dramatic, crying, and insulting? Everything will be ok but just say you didn\u2019t feel good or something and you are sorry.", "Message to your BF, run the F away, as fast as you can.

You don't. Big whoop. You aren't 10. You're a young adult. As an adult, birthdays become less and less important. You were busy and sick. You had a forgettable birthday. It happens. None of that is your boyfriend's fault.\n\nIn my opinion, adults decide what they want to do for their birthday. If you want a party, throw one. You want a romantic dinner, book a reservation. If you want to go out of town, plan the trip. Additionally, there is no such thing as a gift registry for an adult's birthday. It's fine to share some gift ideas with your partner but there is no requirement that they get you something from that list. He isn't Santa.
