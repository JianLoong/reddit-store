You asked nicely, she was rude. Now you get to return the favor. Since you wake up early, a good set of speakers and Baby shark (appropriate for her age group) on loop in the early morning. Preferably under her bedroom.", "NTA. Almost every place has a 'quiet time' of 10p-7a or something similar defined in the lease. You tried to be friendly about it. Time to go to management.", "NTA, and check your apartment rules / contract, because I'll bet money there's something in there about not making excessive noise after a certain hour, usually 10pm. I'd record some dates and times of when this has occurred and take it right to the rental office, see if they'll do anything about it.", "NTA report her to your apartment management. Quiet hours begin at 10 pm in most apartment complexes. I would also let them know that you tried to civilly handle it between neighbors and she was less than pleasant towards you about it. She will more than likely be fined and the behaviour will either stop or she will be evicted for being an inconsiderate neighbor/tenant. If this continues to happen after speaking to your complex, make sure to keep them in the loop about it so they can handle it properly.", "NTA. 11 to midnight is not \u2018normal hours\u2019. Heck, in Germany, they actually have Ruhezeit (rest time) from 10 PM to 6 AM, where you\u2019re legally obligated to not disturb your neighbors with noise such as, oh, let\u2019s say\u2026vacuuming. That\u2019s not to say that you have any recourse like that where you live, but I just find it worth mentioning that an entire country felt strongly enough about this that they wrote it into the law. If she\u2019s up and active that late, then the odds are good that she sleeps later than you.  The petty side of me says you can give what you get and start disturbing her rest in the morning (hey, those cobwebs on the part of your ceiling that happens to be under her bed aren\u2019t going to knock themselves down).", "Nta,who vacuums at midnight?", "Escalate with management.\n\nShe's being a nuisance.\n\nNTA", "NTA - There are noise ordinances for a reason. You can make a complaint with the landlord now that you have tried to resolve this with your neighbor directly.", "NTA\n\nThat is way too late to be vacuuming when sharing walls/floor/ceiling with other apartments. You tried being nice about it and she decided to be a total AH. File a noise complaint.", "Nta. Complain to the landlord", "Most likely, your apartment complex has rules about noise after a certain time.  Check your lease and talk to your landlord since she had such a negative reaction to your reasonable and politely worded request.", "NTA.\n\nCheck for noise ordinance rules, most buildings have them (and most towns honestly which would encompass your building). If the building has the rule, report to the building manager. If the town has it, call in a noise complaint to the cops. Both are well within your rights and not an AH move in the slightest as you've already attempted niceties.\n\nEdit to add: My town has a noise ordinance law, it's 10pm. Just food for thought :)", "NTA \n\nAren't there rules or a policy from the building that after 10pm they aren't allowed to disturb or have over excessive noises? \n\nMaybe you should start vacuuming your ceilings around 6am. See how neighbor would feel.", "NTA. I used to have the same with a housemate who's do it at 7am to piss us off. Funnily enough so wasn't on the tenancy and wasn't supposed to be there. She learnt a life lesson with that one I hope. The landlord kicked her out and she stole my nice brogues and his them in the communal garden.

It's crazy how inconsiderate your neighbor is, file a noise complaint..", "NTA - sorry that you have such an inconsiderate neighbour. \n\nI can understand if it was a one off, but to be doing that regularly is incredibly rude. You tried to be polite about the situation, and she clearly thinks she doesn't have to be respectful of those around her because it's an apartment, which is simply not the case. \n\nIs there a building manager you could possibly speak to about this?", "NTA, research noise ordinance in your city, print it and stick it onto her damn door, if it doesn't help - file a report to the manager and then to police.", "NTA.

Your child of a neighbor needs a reality check.", "NTA. If she has a problem with not vacuuming at midnight she should not be living in an apartment and she needs to move into a home. Apartment living means being cognizant of one's own noise pollution, especially after a certain time. When I lived in an apartment it was after 10pm per my rental agreement.", "As someone who used to work night shift I can assure you midnight was early to vacuum LOL. But I bought a house and could work whenever I wanted. People got annoyed when I mowed at 6 or 7 am but Dude...I wanted to go to bed!!! So maybe this is better addressed with your landlord. Does your apartment have quiet hours? If not...I guess she has every right to vacuum at midnight. If I had to guess she probably works night shift. Apparently about 15% of the population works an evening or night shift. So we aren\u2019t talking about just a few people.", "\"if I have a problem with it then I should not be living in an apartment and I need to move into a home.\"\n\nNope.  When you live in an apartment, you need to be mindful of others.  This is not a reasonable situation.\n\nNTA  Stop talking to her and call the apartment manager and complain.   EVERY TIME.  That's how you get their attention.", "NTA.  There are rules, and she is almost certainly breaking them.\n\nIf she wants to vacuum at all hours, then SHE shouldn't be in an apartment.  She needs to move into a home.", "NTA\n\nA good compromise would be to ask her, if she must, to do it on weekend nights. \n\nNeighbor is being unreasonable though and you tried to handle this like an adult.

NTA", ">midnight is not too late to be vacuuming and I'm just old ('m 27)\n\nI guarantee you, whatever city or county you live in has a noise ordinance law stopping machinery over certain decibels after 8 or 10pm (depending on your location). Midnight is absolutely too late. Your apartment complex also probably has a clause.\n\nYou tried diplomacy. If she does it again, report it as a noise complaint.

The vibrations are extremely loud.", "I do not want to do that to my neighbor below me although it would be funny!", "There is probably a good chance she works nights and is regularly disturbed by people vacuuming and doing many other things in the middle of the day.", "People with little kids who can\u2019t get housework done during the day when they are all over the place, people who work evening or night shifts and do their household chores immediately before or after getting home from work, people with anxiety or insomnia trying to tire themselves out so they can go to sleep.", "Me tbh, i work 10am till 10pm and have a 2 hour commute either way. And my downstairs neighbours arent exactly considerate of me either so i dont mind being a prick to them.", "That's pure evil and I wish I had thought of this when I had horrid upstairs neighbours who would let their children scream and stomp around at all hours of the day and night. It would have been wonderful to be able to retaliate a bit.", "Maybe inform they. I think they can understand you when they get to know that she is cleaning her home at midnight", "So most people I know who tire themselves out are also cognizant of sleep patterns and don\u2019t want theirs to be awaken by someone who vaccins when they finally do sleep. Same with parents who don\u2019t have the time and people who work night shifts. \n\nIf you can\u2019t operate within society\u2019s hours, then you buy or rent a house. Otherwise you live in a community with the norms that come with it.\n\nI had a quiet time in my last appartement of 8pm. We lasted 2 years and then bought a house (yes I know I am very lucky). But I respected the people that lived upstairs during that time too!", "No one with kids sleeping at night is gonna kick on a vacuum.", "I have four kids. None of them wake up from a vacuum.
