Does your apartment have quiet hours? If not...I guess she has every right to vacuum at midnight. If I had to guess she probably works night shift.

But since she doesn\u2019t get this concept, I would at this point review your lease to see what restrictions were put on you (besides quiet hours, there could be things tangentially related, like the percentage of the floor that needs to be covered by carpeting) and speak to your landlord.
