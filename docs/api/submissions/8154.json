I love that you tried to resolve it directly rather than going to management immediately, but she has refused to cooperate, so now you do need to escalate. While she is right that apartment living is not really suitable for people who are averse to all noise, you are objecting to truly loud and inappropriate noise at night.", "NTA Apartments usually have body corporate rules with \u201cquiet times\u201d specified. Take it from someone who spent years being \u201cpolite\u201d, \u201cnicely asking\u201d or trying to ignore it. They don\u2019t stop until the police arrive at their door with a fine for noise violation. Save yourself a decade and get the body corporate involved.", "NTA\n\nI have a sleep cycle that makes it easier to clean around that time, but I'd never even consider doing something like vacuuming until normal daylight hours", "Almost every lease I have ever handled had some provision about tenants having \"quiet enjoyment\" of their spaces - meaning, in legal terms, being considerate of other people in the building.\n\nThis should be forwarded to the landlord as it is a lease breaking action and at this point in time, rentals are turning fast.", "NTA. That is definitely inconsiderate. Her rights end at her door. And the fact that the noise wakes you up like really lady? It's midnight!!! What does she do all day? She can do it during the day but not at night. Even if people slep during the day and up at night they almost never do that shit in the middle of the night.", "NTA.

Or, OP, let the leasing office know about this whole exchange. I'm sure they'd have a different opinion about her vacuuming at midnight...", "THANK YOU.

They usually have a vibrate or mechanical knock generator, but you can get ones with speakers or a combination of both as well. There are all sorts of fancy options with bluetooth audio input, remote controls, timers, etc. available. \n\nThe phrase to search for is \"noise strike back\".", "Most apartment buildings have quiet hours. You should look into yours and file complaints. Enough  complaints can lead to eviction or a lease not being renewed. It\u2019s not as satisfying short term but hopefully it will solve your issue.

Just my $.02.", "Because how can you go wrong with Classical??? Evil cackle.", "Does you lease have noise hours and a noise curfew? Your neighbor needs to move to a house if they need to make vacuum noise at midnight: apartment living requires loud people to make sacrifices not the other way around.
