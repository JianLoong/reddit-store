It wasn't her place to send the video.  I would also bet dollars to donuts that SHE mentioned child support to him--you don't just send a video out of the blue.  They've been chatting.

I'm not interested in the kid at all, but it might make you give up on child support if I threaten the child.'", "NTA your \u201cfriend\u201d has no business sending him anything to do with your son.  She should have told him to contact you for any information about your child.

OP gave you a chance to be involved. You can go through the courts now.", "NTA. Absolutely not. Trina should have had your back. \nNow would be a really good time to block her, lock down your socials so they can't be seen by anyone you don't trust, and keep a notebook with all the ex interactions recorded. \nAlso make sure that your daycare providers don't release bubs to anyone but you.", "NTA she overstepped big time.

That's a huge breach of trust.\n\nYou told her not to respond to him and instead she went to the opposite extreme? \n\nI cannot even imagine what she was thinking but that's a huge huge AH move on her part.", "NTA. Your decision.", "NTA, and it sounds like \"trina\" is pining for your ex....., or already has a relationship with him/via sending that video to your ex.", "She's not your friend.

Funny part, Trina isn\u2019t her real name. But that\u2019s all he knew her by which is why he also text asking \u201cis this still Trina\u201d. Her social media is her real name, so I know for a fact he didn\u2019t see it on there. Also, had no knowledge of a video ever being sent until my other friend told me, bc she was with her when she did it. And then i confront her and she has this other story, while then telling me to figure my own shit out and she doesn\u2019t have time for this.
