But I kindda get you butted out of that, since her own reaction to her kid RUNNING WITH A KNIFE  was yell no running and going back to chilling.  \n\nYou really want to live in that kind of environment?", "NTA but why would you be with a woman who is clearly a terrible mother?", "Nta - .... she knew he was playing with the knife and was too lazy to go get it. His behaviour is a reflection of her parenting.", "NTA: run before you accidentally give that little bastard a sibling", "NTA you were told to mind your own, so you have been\n\nShe knew he was playing with a knife and instead of removing it from him went back to bed after what appears to be the absolute minimum amount of effort to stop it\n\nShe\u2019s blaming you because she doesn\u2019t want to blame herself for her negligence", "NTA.  It is hard when you enter into a relationship and your SO has children from another relationship.  Your gf doesn't want you to parent her son but then wants to blame you when something bad happens.  Yeah, not ideal at all.  Sit down and have a talk.  This can't go on.  If she doesn't want you to be a co-parent with her son, you need to end it.

I would say NTA because of her not wanting you to parent her son in any way, but there's times where you should understand adult intervention is needed.

Both of you saw what you saw and didn't stop it from happening.\n\nI see some people in here claiming that you were \"asked not to participate in his parenting\" or \"shut down when you tried to discipline him\" but I'm not reading that in your post. I'm reading that the only thing you repeatedly tried was using your \"man voice\" and your GF asked you specifically to stop doing *that*.\n\nEven if you *were* asked to back off, it honestly wouldn't matter. This is one of those fundamental, unspoken human rules that when you see a child in this much danger, you intervene. If it makes you the AH or puts you in an awkward position with another adult, oh well. \n\nThe kid sounds like a little hellion. I hope he's okay...", "NTA, dump the GF.", "NTA - I see some really ineffective parenting and lack of personal responsibility happening.

But you let a kid put himself in danger.", "Honestly no you are NTA the Boy needed some lesson in live and also your GF both are now in the possion to learn to listen more and mybe in the future the boy will be a normal functional adult in society. Its very bad that this boy is not listen to anybody and i hope he will recover soon and learn from it", "YTA\n\nSorry but you and your gf are the adults, both of you are responsible for a child's safety in your home so if you see the kid has changed activities and know them to be dangerous -- at the very least you need to inform the other present adult.\n\nOf course gf is more responsible but as adults both of you have a duty of care to the child in your home.\n\nI would say since your gf is not seeming open to constructive conversations over your role in a step-dad way I think you two could do with a mediator like a couples councillor, gf is very defensive and it seems from your post that is unlikely to change, you two can't move forwards with barriers in the way.", "I was with you until you mentioned ignoring seeing the child playing in the kitchen \n\nLike it or not, you're the adult in the house.

She's clearly checked out of making any actual effort to parent this kid, and while you can't be expected to pick up her slack, you don't just walk away from a child playing with a blade. You should have taken the knife off him, and then informed your gf that you were removing yourself from the situation until she learned how to parent her kid.", "Obvious YTA, doesn't matter the excuse you think you have, if you see a kid playing with a knife you stop them.", "Yes YTA, you saw a child literally throwing and catching a knife and did nothing. Didn't grab the knife away, didn't warn the mother, nothing. There's disciplining and parenting, and there's being a reasonable human being. \n\nIf that was your instinct in this situation, I have questions about how you were trying to discipline the child previously which makes me think your account was missing some details. You acted out of spite and like a child in this instance - maybe you did the same before. In any event, you and your partner need to have a real chat about the dynamic in the household around how parenting should go in the future.", "YTA x 2 and  endangering as well. \n\n Whatever parenting issues are being argued about.

He doesn\u2019t listen to anything she says and in the past when I\u2019ve tried to use my \u201cman voice\u201d on him he starts crying and she goes on about how I don\u2019t need to talk to him like that. So after that happened quite a few times. Plus him reinforcing that \u201cI\u2019m not his dad\u201d I\u2019ve kinda checked out of trying to be a fatherly step father and we just sorta exist in the same space together. \n\nFast forward to a couple days ago, we\u2019re laying in bed and he comes in with a cutting knife from the kitchen. He\u2019s playing around with it like a sword and she yells \u201cput the knife back\u201d he keeps playing around completely ignoring her. She makes a move like she\u2019s going to get up and he runs off to the kitchen, she yells \u201cDONT RUN WITH IT\u201d and lays back down. About 20 minutes or so passes and I get up to go outside to smoke a cigarette. As I walk past the kitchen I see he\u2019s in there playing bottle flip with the knife on the kitchen table. Basically throwing it up and trying to get it to land sticking up on the kitchen table. So I keep walking and head on outside. \n\nAbout 3 minutes into my smoke I hear him yell. I immediately knew what had happened and went back to the house. I get there and she\u2019s already dressed and heading to the ER. I stay home and while she\u2019s there telling me what\u2019s going on she asks if I saw him, and I said yeah. She gets super angry about why I didn\u2019t say anything to him. She\u2019s livid and I\u2019m calmly trying to explain every single time in the past where I\u2019ve tried to not even parent but just be an adult nearby and was basically told to mind my business. She\u2019s not hearing any of it and is freaking out. I left the house after we got off the phone that night and have been staying at a friends house since. I know we\u2019re definitely going to need to have a serious conversation about it, but I\u2019m just wondering AITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I suggest to go to very specific scenarios when you talk, because clearly she\u2019s not even in her same page. When she means \u201cyou\u2019re not his dad\u201d, does that include security and health issues? Does she consider you free from ANY money contributions and obligations?

He played with a knife and got hurt, so now he knows not to play with knives. Also, why did your gf not even get out of bed when she saw her kid running with a knife?

Your gf is negligent. You\u2019re nta. She sure is though", "ESH - just because the kid isn't exactly well behaved and her clearly lacking parenting doesn't justify your lack of actions. You're also an adult in this situation who could have acted and prevented an accident - one that could have ended WAY worse. You willingly let him endanger himself just because he's acting up... What if he injured himself in a life threatening way, would you still sit there and thinking you did nothing wrong even though you could have prevented it?", "Ngl lie, had to move in with a friend who had a kid with \"issues\".

It was her responsibility to do something, not the OP.", "Right?? The question is \"aita for not stopping the kid from playing with the knife, given that I knew he had escalated to a different dangerous behaviour with it, his mum didn't know about the knife-flip game, AND he then was injured?\"\n\nYes! \n\nI think a related question is, \"Can you even sleep at night knowing that you are living with a kid who is doing these things and a parent who CBF intervening when their kid is running around with knives?\" \n\nESH, but man, are you cool being someone who does nothing (especially now that you know you'll get in trouble with your gf both for trying to help the situation and for ignoring it)?

Do you think I should? My friend suggested the same, but outside of him our relationship has been perfect. Also, he and I have evolved into just not really bothering each other.
