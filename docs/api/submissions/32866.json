Both Mom (52f) and dad (53m) remarried, but dad remarried a girl nearly 30 years younger. She is gorgeous, she modeled and my dad is upper middle class, so all the people in my class mocked me for her being a \"gold digger\" and some made comments expressing how she was pretty.\n\nI was always ugly, however, and I always knew it/admitted it, so when my graduation came, I wanted to feel pretty for once. (since in all other family events she was always the spotlight, and this time, It was my night, it was all about me for once). I did really well in school, so I graduated top of my class.\n\nI spent my afternoon buying dresses, shoes and makeup, I see her getting makeup professionally, with a dress that's like mine but fancier and more expensive and Gucci shoes. The whole night, when we go out to eat to \"celebrate\", no one compliments me, no one talks about me, she is complimented, discussed. I got sick, because all this build up jealousy and insecurity get tiring, I got tired of every man in my life being attracted to my stepmother, I just got tired.\n\nThe moment I got home I cried and blew up, I poured all my feelings out, in a slightly angry manner. I was immediately reprimanded by my dad, who grounded me, and my stepmom sat there and was comforted by my dad. All my extented family said I was being mean and ungrateful and should apologize, but my mom and stepdad say I was right\n\nAITA???\n\nsome key points of our relationship:\n\n1- She was the one who would constantly put me down and call me hideous and ugly all the time, and when I'd tell my dad he would never do anything about it, and she would lie saying she didn't\n\n2- I asked her if we could do our makeup together with the artist and she said no bc it was too expensive\n\n3- she constantly convinced my dad I did things I did not because she somehow hates me??? I tried to make her like me throughout all my life (she did these things since I was 7)\n\n4- I have constantly defended her to everyone I know, because no one in my family accepted her at first,\n\n5- She stole from dad to pay the makeup artist, stole as in \"did not ask for permission\", but he pretended nothing happened\n\n5- she was on her phone for the whole graduation cerimony, not even glancing, and the one time my father asked about me, she avoided the topic\n\n6- when I told my therapist about these things, she made me quit therapy.\n\n7- both dad and stepmother have a habit of throwing parties to call attention to themselves, like, once a week\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1702339938, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18g8jp6/aita_for_yelling_at_my_stepmom_for_hiring_a/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which would explain why your father chooses her over you (but I digress).\n\nFirst: You are not ugly. Fuck her for saying it.\n\nSecond: Can you not spend more time at your mother and stepfather's house? And, by \"more time\", I mean live with them? Seems like you're old enough to decide where you'd prefer to live and I'd prioritize my mental health over my father's bed warmer.\n\nThird: How did she find out what you told your therapist? And what did you father say about your therapy being canceled? Did your mother have any say in that decision?\n\nFourth: NTA. The only mistake you may have made here was inviting her to your graduation when she didn't want to come and you didn't want her there.", "Holy shit, NTA.\n\nYour stepmom is the asshole (and your dad's just as bad, prioritizing his jackass of a wife over his own daughter). An adult who bullies anyone, but especially a child, over looks has rot in their heart. She sounds self-centred and cruel, and while I'm normally a 'communication is key' person, it sounds like you've tried many times and given her ample opportunity to be less of an asshole, and she's just kept going. Sometimes, blowing up is justified. In this circumstance; you were justified in blowing up about it. \n\nThis resentment towards your stepmom is absolutely reasonable, but don't let it influence future interactions with other 'pretty' women who might look similar to her but have a totally different personality/attitude.\n\nDon't listen to anyone who tells you that you need to apologize. You're the one who deserves an apology. Not your stepmom, and not your father. \n\nAnd congratulations on graduating top of your class!! That's awesome, sincerely happy for you. Even though the 'celebration' night was a bust, the achievement remains untainted.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just live your life the best you can and just put up with the bullshit for a few more years. You're not being a pushover, you're being strong. Show your dad and stepmom that you don't care about her opinion and that there are plenty of people who think you're beautiful and love you. Remember, looks fade. Your stepmom will sooner or later get gray hair, crows feet, and gain weight. Between that and her personality she will have nothing going for her and it might drive your dad to leave her for someone else, someone nicer. So just hold on and remind yourself that you're beautiful both inside and out.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult now I would say stop seeing him. Just so you know beauty comes from actions not looks. So to me you sound beautiful.", "Soft YTA here.  I understand you were upset, but the one thing I don't see in this story is any mention that she did or said anything to hurt you.  This was your night, but it seems you spent the whole time being jealous of your stepmother, watching to see whether anyone noticed her makeup or clothes, and then yelled at her.\n\nJust apologize and move past it.  But you do need to apologize.", "Yeah, there's a good and a bad way to handle envy and insecurity. Sounds like you went about it the wrong way. \n\nThey were all there *for* you to celebrate *you*. Reacting like you did is understandable to a degree, but not justifiable.\n\nYTA\n\nI suggest an apology would go a long way, acknowledging what you did was wrong, also with an explanation of why you felt that way. Let them understand you are envious because she is gorgeous and you wanted the attention she was getting. You never know, you could bond over this and she could help you find your own beauty.", "YTA \n\nCommunication is important. You should discuss how you feel to both of them separately, but tbh I believe anything your stepmother does regarding her beauty or fashion will look bad in your eyes. \n\nYou believe she is trying to steal this spotlight from you, but not once did you say she actively tried to take attention away. All she did was dress nice for an event.", "Honestly, it really depends cuz she does seem like an annoying person, but imo YNTA.", "> did she find out what you told your therapist? And what did you father say about your therapy being canceled? Did your mother have any say in that decision?\n\nI forgot about third, my therapist thought I'd be a good idea to tell them (?) and mom got angry", "I wish I could, but I'm financially dependent on my dad, and dad and mom have shared custody over me", "Thank you! but I really have no idea what to do because I do want to have a relationship with my dad since I have a few more years of living in his house", "You wrote to OP that \"Remember, looks fade\" which I couldn't agree more. Outer beauty is definitely temporary but inner beauty such as intelligence, a moral compass and work ethic are eternal", "The fact that she got professionally made up for someone else's graduation smacks of \"Look at mr!look at me\".", "Yeah, though I was pretty jealous of her. But she always (since I was 7) said I was ugly, or commented to her friends about me being ugly, and after she jokingly said on the car another thing of the sort, I sobbed, then when she asked, in a condescending tone \"what's wrong\" I blew up", "Check Ops edit, because stepmom is the one constantly telling OP they are ugly and putting them down? OP is not the problem here.", "I wish I could do it. But all my family that was there, (some that I have had issues with before and didn't want to see) did not talk to me, and I may be being dramatic, but for all the time since she married my dad (when I was seven) made all my achievements about how she's good of a stepmom, and she made previously many comments calling me ugly either to my face or behind my back. She always picked out my clothes and got jealous of any attention from my father.\n\nBut the whole dinner, only my cousin told me \"congratulations\" but they spent most time commenting on other things, for example, my stepmother's sisters kept talking about how she is pretty and her dress looks amazing, and giving me dirty looks", "english is not my first language, so Idk if I'll word it well. But the whole evening she did actively avoid the topic of me, did her best to avoid me talking to any of my friends, stormed out of the car when I addressed it, which led to my father talking to her which led to my father scolding me, so I only went to cry and \"blow up\" later on, where she Immediately went after my dad, and I have tried to mention these issues with her. Because this isn't recent, it has happened since I was 7.  Her fashion mistake was she lied to me about not having a makeup artist, and did makeup for her sisters and siblings, but not for me and my aunts", "Your therapist screwed up (and probably realizes it now). Sounds like your dad has primary custody and that's a horrible situation for you. Especially if you believe he'd disown you for standing against a pattern of abuse. It sounds like your dignity has a price and that's truly unfortunate. With that being said, don't be surprised if his wife hasn't already made him drastically alter his will.", "Are you over 18? If that\u2019s the case, then you can live wherever you want.

BUT I want to tell you something: you are NOT ugly and I don't think you are ugly. If I am your prospective employer, I would hire you in a heartbeat for paid internship and judge you on your work\n\nTo me you have something your stepmother is missing: inner beauty. You wrote that \"I did really well in school, so I graduated top of my class.\" right? This is one portion of your inner beauty: your intelligence and your work ethic. I want you to remember one thing: physical/outer beauty do not last forever but inner beauty like your intelligence, heart and talent are eternal. Ignore every word she says. I can promise you that karma won't be kind to her but eventually will deliver against her. Do not hate on her but pity her for having an ugly heart\n\nAre you 18? If you are, I suggest you find a part time job to help you earn some money to allow you to move out. If you are heading to uni soon, do make sure you find a university counsellor whom you can confide in to ensure your mental health is not affected. Do not let your stepmum's bullying affect you to the point it gives you a warpped view against physical beauty. Continue with therapy and anyone who cancels it or stop you from getting therapy are doing you a disservice to stop you from thriving to be a better and stronger version of you\n\nDo not be afraid to tell mum and stepdad or any trusted maternal relative what is going on.

Please do what's best for you.", "that's the thing, I'm not 18 yet, and I'm gonna have to deal with it for a few more years or move in with big brother, in my school there are 4 graduations, and I'm still on the 3", "If you are over 15 you can choose which house you stay in."]}
