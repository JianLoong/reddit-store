Why on earth would they feel comfortable going to a big event with fancy clothes and NO makeup? It would be like asking them to come without pants on.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, this is a really insecure rule and I would feel uncomfortable with it for that reason alone.

If the bride asked everyone to go naked to make her dress look better or wear bald caps to make her hair look better no one would say her wedding her rules! Paying for an event does NOT give you autonomy over the body choices of every guest invited to your event. The polite thing would be to do your own makeup & keep it low key/toned down. As a compromise maybe the money all the bridesmaids would save on not getting your makeup professionally done could be contributed towards a getting a high end facial or an emergency derm appointment to try & help the bride feel more confident as well\u2026", "I would just stay in the wedding and wear makeup.  Her request is ridiculous and intrusive.", "Yes though to be fair we probably wouldn't have nearly as many things to read on AITA without wedding drama", "No, the bride would an AH for expecting anyone with half a brain to actually do this.  She does not get to dictate the appearance of the bridesmaids beyond their clothing and hairstyles.", "You\u2019re right. Nobody will be fooled by it, most of the people at the wedding already know what these women look like. If anything the bridesmaids not wearing makeup will direct more attention and conversation to why they aren\u2019t. The bride will still likely feel crappy even if they don\u2019t wear makeup as them not wearing makeup will not cure her acne. Stress increases hormones, hormones make acne. These outbreaks can be stressed related, also. She needs to chill out, for her skin\u2019s and friendship\u2019s sake.", "That explains why men who are attending weddings all wear full makeup, presumably.", "This just isn't true, unless you have a crap photographer. Do men look all washed out in all photos ever? No? Wonder why it's just women told that then...", "I actually wonder if this is a feature of never wearing makeup. I never wear makeup, like I rock proudly my dark upper lip hair level of never wear makeup, and I also don't get treated differently or told to dress more professionally, etc. But again, I have almost never worn makeup. \n\nI realize it is a privilege as a woman to be in the position it doesn't affect me.\n\nMy friends who regularly wear makeup get odd looks, outrageous comments (\"omg, Cheryl, you look SO tired! Are you okay?\") and treated rudely when they go bare faced. It could be the contrast?", "What privilege? I'm a middle-aged woman and I have almost never worn makeup to work. I almost never wear makeup when leaving the house unless I'm specifically getting dressed up. \n\nPlease tell me what \"privilege\" I have that other women don't have.\n\nOh, and I'm not particularly attractive. Maybe a 6 by most standards? I'm not unattractive, but you'd never look twice at me.", "> I never wear makeup, like I rock proudly my dark upper lip hair level of never wear makeup, and I also don't get treated differently or told to dress more professionally, etc.\n\nSounds like you are invisible so nobody suggests changes.", "Not always, but sometimes.\n\nGoing off of what Ive had shared with me, the thing that seems to connect each experience is a \"female\" person not presenting in the way the commenter liked. So that could be race, weight, acne or visible scarring, not being \"feminine\" enough, etc. And also my friend being the younger person in the interaction.\n\nAnecdotal for sure, but interesting.", "I can't speak to your privilege specifically, as I dont know you. But I can say that my friends who have had things said to them by random strangers may have been of a different ethnic background (Im white), had more obvious acne or facial scarring, were younger (20s or 30s), were fat, were trans, or other things perceived culturally as \"less feminine\" (dressed more masc, etc).\n\nLike I said, I dont know you, but those were the things that varied between myself and the friends I have who shared those experiences with me.", "pretty privilege. if you\u2019re \u201cnaturally pretty\u201d according to beauty standards then wearing makeup or not matters less.", "Honestly I think a lot of why I don't get comments from random strangers is because I have rbf. But I've been this way all my life and have been different weights. I also often dress non-femininely. Who knows. People suck.", "I'm not, though.", "YTA. I would try talking to her again, maybe she was delulu that day, and if not drop out if you really object to not wearing makeup at an event", "\"her wedding her rules\" yeah? your body your rules, wedding rules go over the line for a persons body once it goes past simply just an outfit and color cordination imo (and even then in some cases it goes to far...). NTA for wearing makeup/dropping out", "ESH\n\nHer pushing her insecurity on you guys kinda sucks but hey this is some sucky timing and understandable why, and this *is* her wedding and you're the bridesmaids.\n\nI know people will get upset but ngl I find it a bit pathetic and insecure to not be able to go to the wedding without makeup too.", "Yes it is her wedding her rules, but the same can be said for your face your rules.", "I just find it so WILD that someone would be so deeply insecure that they would weaponize it in an attempt to make her bridesmaids look uglier. She cares more about her issues and projecting it on those who she supposedly cares about. That's mentally not normal.  I would want the people who I care about to feel confident and beautiful.", "That is not true at all. \n\nSounds like you had a shitty photographer who didn\u2019t know how to edit.", "ding ding ding", "Huh, as someone who has been professionally photographed many times and never worn makeup, I think that you have no idea what you\u2019re saying. A professional photographer can account for whatever the natural skin tones of the subjects are.", "I seem to have resting \"tell you my life story\" face. Bonus: i get *great* customer service. Negatives: strangers *will* feel comfortable speaking to me, whether it's asking directions, or telling me way too much personal info. But theyre generally nice to me without seeming attracted/coming on to me. If that makes sense?\n\nLike, I ask for help finding things in stores and *most times* am taken directly to the exact spot and given helpful advice and a genuine smile. (I work customer service, I know the difference between a customer smile and a real one. Lol) Ive had employees volunteer to search sections or \"look in the back\" **and they come back with the thing**. My friends and partner are always baffled by the level of helpfulness I get, without being hit on. Its a weird niche that I am very grateful for.\n\nBut it means Im in a weird spot for perspective on stranger social interactions. I guess Im ok with the trade off of being asked to help folks in return. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI got distracted. Lol\n\nMy point is - strangers DO talk to me. But they dont tell me to wear makeup, smile, etc. Its a part of my personal privilege.", "Does anyone remember the aita with a bride who insisted that her guests wore minimal or no makeup; at her catered reception one of the waiting staff wore full makeup and the bride, i think, threatened to call the police if girl with makeup wasn\u2019t removed?", "NTA, but don't go to her wedding wearing makeup.", "NTA - Not sure what this is with brides making totally unreasonable demands.", "NTA, see if she'll accept a nude looking make up for the rest of you and if not the rest of the bridesmaids and you need to sit her down and tell her this request is unacceptable", "Nta. Hydrocortisone cream on a clean face at night works wonders for acne.  Have her try it.", "NTA buy mary some Dermablend", "NTA\n\nYour friend needs to get over it. You wearing a little bit of makeup is not going to take anything away from her. She is the bride. The wedding is literally about her and her new husband/wife. \n\nMy bridesmaids ranged from my SIL who is as pale as a ghost to my friend who used a fake tan and it went a bit wrong - oomper loomper wrong. Did it matter - not one little bit!", "Info: have you gone over compromises such as really basic make up? Neutral eye shadows, lipstick and stuff so that hers will stand out more without anyone having go feel insecure themselves?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine to make it a NO. This is ridiculous.", "YWTA if you go with a full face of makeup because it was her explicit request to not do that. But you could compromise and wear light makeup, something you would wear everyday for work or something like this. Nothing fancy.", "Yes the bride would be the AH for expecting this\n\nBut that doesnt remove the fact that OP would definitely also be the AH for ignoring her wedding request and putting on makeup and attending anyway\n\nIf it's a deal breaker, she should just excuse her self from the event", "Seriously? So everyone looks horrible if a pro photographer takes pictures of their actual, unpainted face?\n\nI feel really sorry for the groom, the best man, father of the bride, all their photos must look awful!\n\nMakeup is a personal choice. I get that for professional shoots and films a little makeup just to cut down on glare and suchlike works wonders, but it's utterly daft to suggest wedding photos would look terrible, and undeniably sexist if you only try and enforce makeup on women.", "Just try makeup as a male presenting person and see how much better that will be received.\n\nIt's like wearing skirts versus trousers: female presenting persons get the choice (and, yes, with that choice comes the possibility that some people might not approve), but male presenting persons don't even have a choice...", "It is entirely unreasonable, but its also her wedding..\n\nThe solution isn't to ignore her request, and completely disrespect her wishes at her own wedding\n\nThe adult thing is just tell her you won't do that, and to not participate if it's a problem for you.\n\n\n\nGoing behind her back to do what she specifically requested you don't do is just as childish and selfish as the brides request... don't fight fire with fire", "The argument is that people look \"horrible\" without makeup, and they don't. They just look like people.", "I am not conventionally attractive. I also have a noticeable facial deformity. Yes, people have treated me like dogshit. People have thrown trash at me. People have laughed at me. Perfect strangers will stop and ask what's wrong with my face (deformity.) It has been like this most my life. I still don't wear makeup... I just don't like it, for multiple reasons. If people hate me for the way I actually look, tbh, I'm kind of grateful to have such a filter. Does it impact my life, opportunities? Yeah, it does. That's ok with me.\n\nI have *nothing against makeup*. Most my female friends wear it. More power to them. If it makes them happy, confident, feel better, regardless of the reason. I am happy for them. It is not for everyone.", "I have a \"kind, open\" face as I've been told, pleasant but nothing outstanding, and it definitely has some boons - sometimes I even get freebies. That does not stop retail workers watch me run around like a headless chicken in the store looking for something, because I have this weird ability to stop right next to the stuff I need and ask a worker where it is. They get a kick out of it.\n\nWouldn't be an issue if they didn't have to rearrange the store like every 3 months."]}
