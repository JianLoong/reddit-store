The bride has made a ridiculous request, but one that can't be ignored completely. You need to either accept or refuse it.\n\nI would refuse and drop out of the wedding (and friendship) if necessary. That type of weaponised insecurity is completely unacceptable to me and I would be very clear about my position.", "NTA\n\nI do have sympathy for Mary, but her request is unreasonable. You should be able to wear make up i you want to.\n\nIt would be really weird if her bridal party wearing make up would steal attention away from her.", "NTA \n\nShe wants the bridal party to look plain next to her, but are you willing to step out of the wedding and lose the friendship if she pushes it?", "NTA\n\nWhat is it with brides wanting to look prettier than the bridesmaids? It's not a beauty contest.", "NTA. Standing in solidarity with her would only work if she also was going bare face.", "She can request it however it\u2019s not kind to ask the bridal party to make changes to their physical appearance after they have all agreed to participate. \n\nShe (hopefully) wouldn\u2019t ask anyone to have clown make-up done for the wedding ... not wearing any make-up is in the same territory. \n\nAsk her to compromise. Light shades of something. Skin tone palettes can help.\n\nIt is her wedding but she\u2019s still your friend. Have a honest conversation with her.\n\nNTA", "NTA for disagreeing. I understand her insecurity, and if she were asking you all to wear minimal makeup, I would say it\u2019s reasonable. But it\u2019s completely unfair to ask everyone to do something that will I turn make them feel insecure to share in her discomfort. \n\nYWBTA if you showed up with makeup, though. You (and, important here, the others who are uncomfortable with this) need to say you\u2019re not okay with wearing no makeup and want to at least wear something subtle. If you\u2019re empathetic and make it clear that no one is going to outshine her, but you want to feel comfortable and be able to enjoy the day and be fully present instead of thinking about this and she still says no, back out.", "Holy cow.  Next she\u2019ll request her bridal party to stop washing their faces with the hopes everyone develops some acne.  You are most def NTA.", "It is her wedding, her rules.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean you have to be in her wedding if she insists on foolish rules. She's the bride. Everyone will be looking at her anyway, and besides, anyone who insists on making others insecure to address their own insecurity is an AH.\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA but I would subtley put makeup on. Like just a foundation base to even my skin tone and some mascara. Don\u2019t do fake lashes or anything too obvious.", "YWBTA for showing up with make-up on against her wishes  but YWNBTA for pushing back or for saying that this is a dealbreaker for you. You're not obligated to make yourself uncomfortable in an effort to make her less self-conscious.", "NTA. Not only is this an unreasonable request, it\u2019s a last minute one. She can\u2019t make a rule like this two weeks before her wedding and expect her bridesmaids to comply with it. This is the kind of rule you make before your bridesmaids invest time and money into being part of your wedding. Unless your friend is willing to reimburse anyone who doesn\u2019t want to comply with the rule, she needs to be more flexible about this.", "Uh, weird.\n\nHer wedding, her rules, yeah. But it's a weird rule under the circumstances, and even weirder to call it solidarity when she's not joining you in going without makeup. It sounds like maybe she's afraid that if everyone is wearing makeup the bridesmaids will be prettier than her.\n\nAnyway, definitely NTA for \\*wanting\\* to wear makeup.", "Could you do your makeup yourself? Maybe something light just so you don\u2019t feel so bare but not all \u201cdone up\u201d. If the bride doesn\u2019t do the extras then the party usually doesn\u2019t either.", "NTA but I think you need to step away from the bridal party if you choose to wear makeup.\n\nWhat a silly request. Several of my girls... I would almost not recognize them without makeup. It is their persona, that they share with the world, and never leave home without it. Why on earth would they feel comfortable going to a big event with fancy clothes and NO makeup? It would be like asking them to come without pants on.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, this is a really insecure rule and I would feel uncomfortable with it for that reason alone. It's her wedding, surrounded by her family, friends, and the one that is choosing to love her forever. No one is going to be looking at the other girls and comparing. And if the photos are the issue, she can photoshop to her heart's content afterwards. Anyway, a good friend shouldn't want to put their friends down to lift herself up.", "NTA, I'm getting married, and honestly, I don't understand these crazy brides. It's like weddings, being it the worst in people. I randomly started getting cystic acne in college, and it was hell. I mean shit, I get adult acne still, but not nearly as bad. So I understand, but she's having her own makeup done, so how is that solidarity? Idk, that's just so weird to me. I was able to figure out what was causing my cystic acne, but she may want to reach out to a dermatologist if she can.", "NTA. Her request is ridiculous. I\u2019d politely decline.", "NTA you all have booked makeup appointments. She is wearing makeup so you should too. She isn't a good friend if her idea of setting her friends up to look \"worse\" than her at her wedding.", "Ohh that's an unusual AITA... I'd say NTA *but* in your shoes I'd wear less make up than planned if it makes my friend feel better on her special day.", "I have to go with \"her wedding, her rules\". It's a weird rule, and possibly not done with the kindest of intentions, but if you go against her wishes, you risk causing a  rift between you. Depending how strongly she feels about it, it could end up really affecting her day as well, which I am sure you don't want to do. \n\nOk to be annoyed, but YWBTA if you wore makeup contrary to her clearly expressed wish.", "YWBTA. if you are that uncomfortable, it's best to bow out of the wedding altogether. Showing up painted against her wishes will cause unnecessary drama", "NTA. You but and the bridesmaids should talk to her and let her know that you're still going to wear make-up", "Bow out of the wedding party if you don't want to conply", "I don't think it's too outlandish a request. Just stick to the foundation to make her happy on her day.\n\nNTA.", "I'm gonna say YTA here, but only slightly.\n\nShe is clearly very self conscious and upset that she'll have the acne on her wedding day and it's her day, not yours. You won't look ugly by any means and if she would find it supportive you should do it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The reasons are if she does have an open sore on her face and gets an infection, the artist can be held liable and although it won\u2019t be life threatening, she could receive bad reviews or have a license/certification taken away or suspended or a fine.

A real friend wants their friends to feel great about themselves- and should understand that someone else\u2019s beauty does not detract from their own. She needs to go to a dermatologist and figure out her own health, and let you all do what you want to feel beautiful. I wouldn\u2019t show up with a full face of makeup on the wedding day (recipe for disaster and tantrums) but maybe work with her to get to an doctor, talk about letting bridesmaids do light and natural makeup, and if she\u2019s being ridiculous, consider if the friendship is worth it.", "NTA and wtf.

I avoided it somewhat when I got married the first time because I did the courthouse thing, but I look back at my pictures from that day and wish I had been prettier and actually felt bride-like.
