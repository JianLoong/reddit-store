It seems like most commenters have never given birth and are clueless about the needs of a pregnant/postpartum mother and a newborn, and how exhausting it is.Plus the baby will cry and constantly keep your parents and any other family members awake. Your sister's reasoning for needing your room is totally reasonable and you are acting ignorant and selfish. Stop acting like a brat just because you feel entitled to take revenge just because she wouldn't switch rooms before. This is irrelevant and makes you seem really immature and like a bitter, unreasonable person. Do you really feel like holding onto bitterness is more important than the rest of your family's needs and the care of your future niece or nephew? Not a hill you should be willing to die on and not a good look for you.\n\nEdit to add: I would have voted ESH if you were much younger, and if it really seemed like your sister was trying to force you or \"guilt\" you into switching. I don't believe that pleading her case and calling you selfish are out of line here. You're being unreasonable and it's fair that you get called out for it. Plus you seem completely unwilling to negotiate or compromise. You could ask that the upstairs room be redone, but no, you're stuck on the fact that she wouldn't trade even though it was ages ago.

Usually moms don\u2019t stay holed up in their room, will it bother you to walk out of your room and trip over baby items? What about if your sister can\u2019t get the baby to nap unless it\u2019s being held or in a swing or anything and sits in the living room while the baby is crying?\n\nAlso consider that giving birth is unpredictable- what if she needs a c-section?

I don't think you realize exactly how fast, and how suddenly a baby can  leave your sight even if you're watching it around the clock, and then it takes a tumble down the stairs and dies.\n\nOn the other hand...having a baby is a choice the vast majority of the time, and it comes with all kinds of risks and both parents need to do their due diligence before having one, and realizing that there will be challenges that are pretty much just going to be on them. You didn't ask for them to have a baby.\n\nNow, her calling you selfish, yeah, technically that's right. You're not moving because 1) you either just don't want to, or 2) the reasons you stated which are all about you. Selfish isn't always a bad thing. Doesn't make you an ass. I don't think she had the right to come in *expecting* you can and should accommodate. I don't know how long you've had the room but for some of us our rooms become our little personal homes. It's not so easy to just up and leave, so I get it. Stability and consistency is important for teens, too. I was moved around a lot, and just moving from room to room made things difficult for me.\n\nHowever as someone who is never excited about pregnancies, and thinks the world is not equipped to handle nor deserving of having children, and is scared to death of the future in store for my niblings and don't think my sister should have had them (not my say at all), *I* would give the room to the sister because the odds of her or the kid falling down the stairs are higher than the odds for me, and so is the odds of one or the other dying than it would be for me (I'd wait until further into the 2nd trimester when the likelihood of this baby being carried full term is higher). That's out of care and concern for my sister, the theoretical kid, and knowing who my sister is and how she often tries to do everything herself, doesn't ask for much, is overall very responsible, etc. I don't know if maybe there's more to the relationship between you and your and sister, if there's resentment, bitterness, etc, but I've been in a similar situation when I was 16 and at least for us, it was not that big of a deal.

One is a VP for a tech company, another an executive level manager in tech as well, and the other is a doctor. One had a child her senior year of high school. They lived with their parents from having the baby, to graduating college, to getting married and having their own children. All moved out when their oldest child was around 1st grade. One moved out with enough to buy their home without a loan in a high cost of living city. The other bought their home with a huge down payment and fully renovated without loans. The third inherited a house and has multiple properties. This is the definition of building generational wealth. Their parents knew those few years of sacrifice would set their kids up to be stable and also set them up to not have to worry about their kids' futures. \n\nI would say all moved out before the age of thirty. By comparison, there are a lot of folks out there that moved out as young adults and are struggling.

That is my normality and obviously not the same for everyone. \n\nJust to add, i did infact return home after uni at 22, and again at 25 after a relationship ended, and again in my late 20s when my landlord sold the house i rented. Support from family is absolutely essential and i'm glad she has that option. My opinion here was more along the lines of life experience and independence is important before having a baby.

In my family it would be a given even for me that I would swap rooms with my sister if she really needed it because she is having a baby and that's more important than my room having been freshly painted. She would also be expected to do the same for me and there are other things we are just expected to do for each other because that's what family is for (for instance my parents never charged us any rent or groceries even when we were living with them as adults because that's what parents are for, but we were expected to pull our weight in the household as we had been doing since we were fourteen, because this is a house and not a hotel).", "Op wouldn't be giving up HER personal space, she'd be switching to a different personal space in her PARENTS house.", "In my family we would lay off the personal consequences routine for the benefit of their baby and the person recovering from a pregnancy.

I would be willing to bet that at least half of mothers have to climb a flight of stairs each day.   When I had my twins my husband and I lived in a second floor walk up.  We didn't try to convince the people living on the first floor to switch with us.  When we bough a house when the twins were two it had two bedrooms upstairs with kitchen and living room downstairs.  It's not like she's asking out of some life or death desperation.  The older sister has just decided that she wants what she wants.  What happens when the baby is a year old and the sister decides it will be easier to get her child to sleep upstairs where it's quieter?

All of us came from a pregnant person at some point. Mankind comes from pregnancy, that\u2019s like, literally how that works. Are some people AHs while pregnant? Yes. But you don\u2019t have to use language like this, it comes off misogynistic as hell.", "XD Oh Fuck..... I am going to get fired because of you", "Yes and they allocate the bedrooms in a way that benefit the family as a whole.

It is my house but i haven't entered my kids' rooms in years tbh.  Yes blah blah \"my house\" you do what you want with your room aside from use it as a meth lab and we're good.

I would absolutely NOT make them switch. Sister is the one who got pregnant. If my 17 year old (whose room I just spent money to paint and re-floor) said no, that would be game-over. Why should I make one child change her life because her sister made a piss poor decision? Just because you\u2019re pregnant, you don\u2019t become the ruler of all. I will continue to house you for free, I\u2019ll even supply groceries. You have a safe place to stay for you and the baby, but your sisters comfort and happiness is just as important as yours.", "Of course it\u2019s just my opinion!  Well, except for safety.  That is well documented.  \n\nHowever, it\u2019s much smarter to have the family making huge amounts of noise when the newborn is sleeping for the first 3-4 weeks, so the baby learns to sleep through anything.  Ask any parent of more than one kid about it!  My first, she woke easily. For 2-4, the house was chaotic.  They slept through *anything*.  Much easier, and all you need to do to arrange it is be loud for the newborn.", "Definitely especially after the first year or something when she needs to make less trips up and down.", "Agree that OP has the right to say no.

It\u2019s going to be more quiet up there, especially if mom formula feeds (and therefore is in the kitchen with the baby all hours of the night). If mom is up and downstairs she\u2019ll be all over the house, but if she has no reason to come upstairs it becomes more of a haven.

For all we know she was on the pill and made this guy wrap it up and she still got pregnant. Shit happens, and the way I see it I am sure that this sis is going through a lot right now. I also disagree with the sister becoming entitled over this room, it just makes a ton of practical sense for them to switch.

There is going to be a lot of nights baby is going to be wailing and attention is gonna be mainly on grandbaby and sister's recovery all the time.\n\nI would swap the bedrooms BUT get to the root of the problem now by talking with your parents and sister about expectations.

What she's offering isn't even a bad deal, you'll get a bigger room. You're doing this out of spite only, it costs you nothing. So what if is recently painted and got new flooring? Did you pay for that yourself? Even if you did, there are tons of ways to solve it, you can get the money back and do the new room. I don't understand your culture, are y'all not capable of love?

For mothers to carry to term? \n\nOh, just kidding, they only want married, white Christian mothers living under a very specific set of guidelines to procreate. Everybody else gets to fuck off I guess. She should have kept her legs closed, unless it was rape or sabotage, in which case she should have fought harder and deserves to suffer anyway.", "That\u2019s awesome! Most of my friends are having to pump, supplement, etc. after a few weeks/months and are constantly washing pumps and bottles. Hope it goes as smoothly as your experience for me!", "It\u2019s likely she asked her parents first, and they told her to see whether OP was willing. These aren\u2019t little kids, and they just redid the room for OP. \n\nAs a parent of older teenagers, I only mediate their disputes, and only when they\u2019re at an impasse, and if I was the parent here, I wouldn\u2019t be forcing a change. Part of growing up is learning to negotiate fairly. Sure, they could force it, but without a practical reason, why would OP need to swap? Sis has everything she needs plus extra square footage and a full bath upstairs.", "Most definitely don't. However my little sisters are 21 and 22 and both recently became mothers. They both moved out on their own well before they got pregnant. One lives with the father and the other lives with roommates who are also parents (though the mother of the other child is a terrible one) even with this obstacle, she's still an amazing mom!", "No.  Don't be silly.  All pregnancies discussed on reddit are the fault of the woman in the story being slutty and irresponsible.  All of them.  Every.  Single.  One.  \n\n\nOr, at least, that's what most redditors seems to believe.  They never seem to remember that a man was involved, too, or that birth control fails.", "Shhh, every birth is easy and perfect, difficult recoveries don't exist. \ud83d\ude43\n\n(/s in case that's not obvious -- I had a C-section with EVISCERATION as a complication, my incision opened and dumped out my intestines... So I'm well aware that climbing stairs is NOT an option after every birth!)", "My daughter (24 at the time) and her husband lived with us for 3 years. It was wonderful being there to help with the babies and to know they were safe and cared for. They moved out last summer and I miss them a lot.", "This is a healthy perspective.", "Yes! The \u201ctakes a village\u201d thing is real. Also, in many countries there\u2019s no State support for moms, so support from the family makes a huge difference in both the mom\u2019s health and the baby\u2019s.", "Oh no silly, it\u2019s much more productive to make condescending comments and answer everything but the actual question than to give a well reasoned out answer as to why this might be done. \n\nBut as some other brain surgeon says, conversations you know, *digress.* We should get out more apparently.", "They're clearly not in the US. We don't call it a pram.", "People can travel to states that allow abortion, too, like that woman from Texas did.", "My brother and I are both 1960s birth control babies, him a condom, me an IUD. Legal abortion wasn\u2019t available yet, but mom chose not to have the IUD removed when she was pregnant with me. It was embedded in the placenta and would likely have terminated the pregnancy. \n\nBut yeah, certainly some young people make awful choices and have unprotected sex or intentionally get pregnant. Lots of young people who get pregnant just hit the birth control lottery, though.", "Thank you very much. I'm in Missouri. My governor gleefully signed the trigger law that made us the first in the country to make any kind of abortion illegal. You're 12 years old and were raped by your uncle? Congratulations 6th grader! You're going to be a mommy!", "My daughter, 24 @ the time, came back home pregnant. BD not in the picture. Her & my grandson still live with us & he stays with me while she works.", "It's the best years to do it tbh lmao my sister did the same with her first until she was about 4. They're fun, they're cute, they're cheeky. My parents and I love my niece living with us and I loved being able to live with them and my daughter for a bit. I was never a big kid person but god are they funny little things lmao", "And then you have the people in the comments who are literally saying \"it's not OPs fault she got knocked up by some useless scrub who left her, she shouldn't be punished.\" But they definitely wanna punish someone they deem unworthy of that very village that helps raise better humans in the first place. \n\nSo many people here are like it's her fault she got knocked up not yours and while that's the case that still doesn't change the fact it's her parents house who clearly want their young pregnant daughter safe at home with them \ud83d\udc80", "They don't ignore him, they point to the sister and say \"YOU PICKED THE SCRUB, STUPID WOMAN.\" Not understanding or caring that he could have been the worlds greatest boyfriend until he heard the words \"I'm pregnant\" come out \ud83d\ude2d", "Honestly, even if she has access to abortion, the sister just might not want to and that should be respected. If we\u2019re going to respect women\u2019s right to their bodily autonomy we need to respect that they might choose to have a baby in a situation that another person wouldn\u2019t.", "I live in a blue state with a not so good governor, but he has kept abortion safe and legal, so I give him kudos for that. I can't imagine the horror women who live in states with bans have to go through if they don't want to be a mother or just aren't ready! It's even worse when they have to travel out of state, and have to worry about being punished by law when they return home!!", "> The gratitude I have too is insurmountable. Having that extra help from my parents was a massive life saver on my mental health. I couldn't have done it without them AND my baby was EXCELLENT. \n\nThis is how so many cultures around the world operate and one thing they have in common is they're all happier! Not because they're taking care of a baby, but because their culture values community and togetherness. Every single person will be down at some point, you need to invest into your support network so they'll pick you up when you're down.", "it reminds me of my old nickname, just replace the n with an m and it's the same pronounciation", "sucks a lot, im canadian with friends in red states (albeit, said friends lack uteruses) so the fact it even takes a second to buffer in my mind before i go \"oh *shit,* right...\" speaks to how astronomical it is that rights can just be deleted like that."]}
