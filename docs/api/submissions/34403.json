If she wasn't pregnant and now wanted to switch I would say no. You know this would be more convenient for her for a multitude of reasons, but you are denying the room only because of the fresh paint and flooring. Maybe compromise and see if she will help you or help fund new paint and flooring in her existing room, then switch.

I have been pregnant having to go from an upstairs room to walk downstairs with a crying newborn for a bottle or diaper change. Its annoying as all hell, but its doable.

Also is she wanting a baby changing station for the bedroom etc...

Why not move in with him... Or will he also be expecting to stay over in the smaller room with her and baby? Hmm...
