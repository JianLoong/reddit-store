I could be wrong, but I guess from experience it\u2019s not a specific culture or religion but is part of a few spiritual practices. \nYou were maybe a bit harsh, but honest and concerned. She does need to care for her body or it will return to the ground sooner than intended.", "NTA - grown adults with access to proper amenities shouldn\u2019t be getting trenchfoot. This sounds like caveman behavior. If that\u2019s her lifestyle choice, that\u2019s fine, but you don\u2019t have to support someone who is being willfully negligent with their health. Let alone be guilt tripped into thinking it\u2019s acceptable.", "NTA. Her lifestyle as a French soldier in Napoleon\u2019s army in 1812 is unfortunate, but you\u2019re not wrong for finding it disturbing.", "NTA. Her physical health is declining and you seem to genuinely care about your friend. However, you probably could have used a different word other than \u201cgross\u201d. Maybe apologize for the terminology and tell her you\u2019re just concerned.", "NTA, but you could have indeed said it in a nicer way, and avoided saying it\u2019s gross. It was a clumsy way to show concern. But she can definitely keep doing her grounding stuff while making sure she like, you know, washes her feet thoroughly everyday.", "NTA. Your friend definitely needs to clean her damn feet or change something in the daily routine to avoid ER visits. I\u2019m not a grounder, but I assume they try and take care of their feet. Keep them warm, dry, and clean.", "Doesn't trench foot come from feet being wet for way too long? Does she stand in a swamp all day long?", "NTA\n\nSeafarers talk about grounding. Being at sea for multiple months. Coming in contact with land after 4 months is a completely different feeling.\n\nBut going barefoot all the time and not taking appropriate care is disgusting. \nThis is like brushing our teeth. All vegans, vegetarians, only meat, omnivore, and other diets don't prevent people from brushing their teeth. In some diets, you have to brush more to have good dental hygiene.\n\nHere, the friend is using grounding as a poor excuse to not maintain proper hygiene.", "NTA. There is no excuse for lack of hygiene and then claiming it\u2019s her \u201cculture\u201d.

Well done for calling out the disgusting behaviour.", "As a kid I've spent all my summers barefoot, as did all my friends (we were a wild bunch), and never had health issues, because I've washed my feet like 3 times a day at least. It was in the country and the access to the water wasn't always as simple as \"turn on the tap\", we often got our water from a well. I am sure an adult in a modern city won't have any problem maintaining barefoot hygiene, if they are so inclined. \n\nNTA, and it's not the issue of culture or beliefs. AFAIK grounding doesn't prohibit washing. Your friend is simply slacking on hygiene and you did nothing wrong calling her on it.", "Being a dumb hippie isn't a culture NTA", "As somebody who lives in a country with 20+ cultures but is the size of Texas, our general rule is: you can do what ever you want as long as 1) it doesn't affect other people or 2)affect children. \n\nIf it's a professional environment,  absolute filth, sharing housing etc then absolutely fucking not.", "NTA. Does she wash her feet every single time she gets home? If not performing the most basic hygiene is part of her culture, then it's indeed very gross.\n\nIt's up to you, but I know I wouldn't bother forcing her into the hospital, if she refuses modern medicine then it's her own issues to deal with.", "She doesnt need shoes. She need soap and water and clean towel.", "If grounding was an official religion Reddit would be tearing you to shreds right now.\n\nNTA", "Yta, if u were only says clean ur foot u are off the hook, but to tell her to wear shoes is disrespecting.", "YTA- If i\u2019m being completely honest you seem really ignorant. As a fellow grounder myself i feel like you should definitely let your friend do what she wants. You simply thinking you\u2019re still not passing any judgement even after writing this is absurd. ALSO who cares if she didn\u2019t want to go to the hospital for it? Modern medicine isn\u2019t something to be trusted. Nowadays all people want you to do is be \u201cnormal\u201d and i just can\u2019t have that. I feel personally offended by your terminology. Gross? You sound like the gross one after coming on here and writing this. Absolutely disgusting.", "YTA. I also ground and it\u2019s her business on what she does with her feet, I understand your a caring friend but calling her gross is out of line and you should apologize. There are several disadvantages of modern medicine such as the side effects of therapeutics, inadequacy in diagnosing chronic diseases such as arthritis, hyperacidity, and allergies it\u2019s time consuming and has very costly bills that only go to the government.
