Do you know what I do when I get home from said hike? WASH MY FEET like any other healthy human should. NTA.", "Yeah, I've read that hookworm is endemic in parts of the Gulf Coast of the US, because the soil conditions are right for the worms (larvae? I dunno) to live and people go barefoot a lot. That could be a real concern, depending on where they live.", "As someone who's had trench foot ( drunkenly fell asleep with sweaty work boots on and thats all it took) the only relief i get/prevention from it happening again IS being barefoot/in sandals as much as possible", ">Weird, my rubber soles also allow me to maintain uninterrupted contact with the ground.\n\nYour comment made me laugh because it's witty, but, yeah, not really.  Your shoes maintain contact with the ground, but the rubber sole ensures you only maintain uninterrupted contact with your shoe.  Rubber is an insulator so safer if you're dealing with electricity.\n\nI love my sneakers.  I like to have them in multiple colors and I wear them when I'm out and about.  But if I'm walking out side it's my EarthRunners sandals, (weather permitting) all the way.  When I'm wearing them on my dog walks I come back more energized.  When I wear sneakers for that I come back more tired.  I'm not exhausted, mind you, just more aware that I've expended effort.\n\nBut trench foot is seriously gross.  I only go barefoot in my own back yard and I still do a foot wash after.", "From what I've read, there's been a resurgence of cases in the southern US.", "Well, yeah, but my point was that if you're concerned about tetanus, just get the vax.", "He'd complain about hippies who were like that when he tried dating within the in-group!\nWe got into fights over psychedelic drugs now and then. I have no problem with them and occasionally trip myself, but he acts like what he's hallucinating in our short circuiting brains is actually real. Peak dude bro pseudo wisdom. He'd take it hard when I shut that shit down.\nThat's whatever, I stopped talking to him because he fell into the chud circuit and removed himself from a group chat on NYE this year after claiming to be a moderate centrist but he went on a rant about Tucker Carlson's annual rage bait about a War in Christmas out of nowhere. This guy isn't a Christian for starters. Fuck, the dude is so demented I could go on for hours.", "And my point is that the people who engage in grounding are probably not concerned about catching tetanus, or anything else, so they would likely not bother with getting the tetanus or any other vaccine, especially if they are anti-vax.", "No, Judge Mills Lane", "Right?! There are other hazards to going barefoot, but wouldn't she be LESS likely to get trench foot if she's not wearing shoes? What the heck is she doing?", "I don't see how being barefoot would cause trench foot. trench foot is caused by cold, wet, unsanitary conditions.  Its named trench foot because it was a real problem during WWI. soldiers in the trenches, their feet were constantly wet and cold. Their feet started rotting in their boots. Wearing shoes would not help Trench foot, it needs air exposure to air to dry it out.\n\nIf being bare foot caused trench foot, I would have lost my feet when I was a child. I was barefoot all summer. My mother didn't get us new shoes until school started. I still wear minimal open shoes in the summer. I wear something with a sole because I don't want to step on sharp things. You gotta air out those tootsies.", "How does a barefoot person get trench feet in the first place? The biggest leading cause of trench feet is having \"damp feet\" for a multiple days (like marching as a soldier or backpacking with soaked shoes), and if she was barefoot 24/7 then how did her feet never dry off??", "Medal of Horror", "Dunno what exactly triggers downvotes here, but suit yourself.\n\nDid i shatter your expectations that all people who walk around barefoot are dirty?
