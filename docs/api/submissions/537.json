It causes large traffic delays when we've seen other people stop here to either pick up or drop other people off. So, I said no, as I think it's rude to stop there.  I've suggested she use an umbrella or stay home and I'll do the groceries.  She says even with an umbrella, her feet will get wet and she'll be uncomfortable the entire grocery shop; and she feels like staying home is a \"punishment\" for her not wanting to get wet, which I don't understand.

I originally was going to go with yes, but you offered her several alternatives to blocking traffic at the front of the store. Grocery pickup seems like a fair compromise.", "NTA.   If you're complaining about other driver's actions, then it would be hypocritical for you also contribute to the same problem.  Passengers need to respect some of the driver's decisions, because the driver is ultimately responsible for their actions.", "Info\n\nIs there a car park for this grocery store?", "NTA", "YTA.

Perhaps he was lazy to drive into traffic n made the excuse but either way I don't think the reason holds up. The whole point of a car is to avoid getting icky, would OP as an example not drive to work to protect other drivers from traffic! A partner's needs, or whims, depending on  how one looks at them come first as long as they aren't totally unreasonable, which she wasn't in this case.", "Yes she was, he offered several alternatives.\nHe didn\u2019t want to clog up traffic."]}
