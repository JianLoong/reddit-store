{"id": 16555, "submission_id": "139y22y", "title": "AITA For Putting My Daughter First", "selftext": "One of my closest, oldest friends lost her son last year. His passing was traumatic for multiple reasons not course so I instantly went to be with her. My daughter and he were born 3 months apart so they were very close and she was devastated. Since then I have tried to be sensitive to my friend's needs but she has not shown my daughter that same sensitivity. I gave her a year before I started trying to gently nudge her, I accepted her missing my daughter's birthday party because she said knowing her son will never turn that age, he died just before his birthday, was too hard. She's confided in me that she's struggling because she gets no real time to grieve. She's been focused on getting her younger children through this and I do feel bad that she is having a hard time. \n\nNow onto the problem. I let my daughter text her when she misses her friend because it comforts my daughter. Sometimes she doesn't respond until the next day which tbh upsets me but I hold my tongue. Recently my daughter wanted to go to the cemetery and see him so I asked my friend to meet us there as I'm not sure where he is buried. She said she couldn't because her sons weren't wanting to see him that day and she can't leave them home alone. I snapped. I told her my daughter is struggling and she could stand to think of her sometimes too. She got quiet and told me her days consist of working and handling her children's grief and trauma and by the end of the day, she has nothing left to give to anyone else. Then she hung up and I haven't heard from her sensei. I sent her a text that I loved her but I was done communicating until she prioritized my daughter a little too. Was that really too much to ask?\n\nEdit to add a reason for my thought process I guess I didn't think it was a huge ask. My daughter blamed herself in the aftermath because they fought about something petty, then he died and at his funeral she took the time on her own, to reassure her he knew she loved him and wasn't to blame, so I thought she would be ok with helping me with her.\n\nI don't know if this helps but she let my daughter have one of his prized possessions to remember him by, which is another reason I thought she'd understand how hard my daughter is handling it.\n\nEdit 2: I am taking b your comments to heart. When I see her she never behaves like she's drowning, she laughs, cracks jokes, goes about her daily life. I never thought to scratch the surface, I just thought she waz coping really well and being strong. I will apologize. I don't think she'll want me to take the kids, she's very protective of them and I imagine I have some work to do to get back that level of trust. I do have my daughter in therapy.\n\nSlight Update: I told her I was sorry for being so harsh and insensitive and that I loved her. She said she forgives me but needs space right now. I told her if she ever needs it I'll take the kids, but she said since her youngest and my daughter don't get along very well she appreciates the offer but she thinks it's best if he's not pushed to get along with her right now. \nI openly admit she's high strung and bickers with him in a sibling type way. She loves him, she just views him like an annoying little brother and my friend's son who died would sometimes have to remind her he's a lot younger than her. My friend would also have to remind her sometimes and they'd usually leave shortly after. They did get along really well at the funeral though and I would make sure she'd have patience but I know my friend is protective right now.", "created_utc": 1683397848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139y22y/aita_for_putting_my_daughter_first/", "score": 1510, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I appreciate that your daughter is struggling with her own grief, but that is your responsibility to manage, not your friend\u2019s.

And she is also having to care for her other children\u2019s grief.\n\nYou are going through a lot, but she is going through so, so much more.

Are you an actual monster? HER CHILD DIED.", "[deleted]", "Goodness, this whole situation is hard \ud83d\ude14\n\nFrom the way you wrote your post, it very much sounds like you see her grief as more of an inconvenience to you than a very real trauma she has yet to process. Every time you mention these \"concessions\" , you don't really talk about them like, well, a friend would. I'm willing to allow for the fact that maybe you've done more for her than you wanted to spell out, but it doesn't change the fact that it really seems like you feel as if she should be over this by now, and that's just not how grief works. \n\nYTA. I don't think you need to consider whether she's a good enough friend, I think you need to consider whether you are. It's not really about putting your daughter first", "This has to be fake. No human could possibly be this devoid of self awareness.", "YTA. You are demanding, rude and a bad friend. You could have asked for directions, you could have asked her to propose a date when she is available but you chose to berate her and cut connections with her until she behaves the way you want? And on top of that you annoyed that it takes her a whole day to answer you daughter while she is raising multiple children who lost their brother? Are you even serious? You are the worst. Probably she is better off without you anyway.", "YTA.  She does not need to prioritize your daughter.  You are the one who needs to be dealing with your daughter's struggles, not hanging them on a deeply grieving person. And this is supposedly one of your closest, dearest friends...and this is how you treat her?  Who needs enemies?  Go ahead, tell her you're done communicating until she does what you demand...it'll make going no contact with you that much easier, you're doing all of the heavy lifting so she can dump you.", "You are a collosal asshole, this has reached a whole new level of assholery, you entitled, insensitive jerk. How dare you put your selfish expectations on a mother grieving her child. Grieving a lost child doesn't happen in a year, or 5 years. She will be grieving for the rest of her life. I hate to break it to you but your daughter is not more important than her grief. YTA", "YTA. One of my friends died in high school. Nobody in our friend group knows where they are buried exactly. Our school planted a tree in honor of them. While it killed to not know where they were, everyone respected the family\u2019s privacy and did not make a big deal about it. We all found other ways to grieve (letting go of balloons, writing letters, reminiscing on good times, to name a few). We meet up once a year to pay our respects at her tree. I suggest you find a way to help your daughter grieve that isn\u2019t constantly reminding the child\u2019s mother that their child is dead. Plant a tree, a flower, write a letter, DO ANYTHING ELSE. \n\nYour job as a parent is to not only help your child through grief, but to teach them that dealing with grief is just as important as respecting the privacy of a grieving family. The mother is not a grief counselor, so stop making her out to be one. Why don\u2019t you make some baked goods for her with your daughter? Why don\u2019t you teach your daughter how she can support the grieving family? Maybe offer to babysit or treat the mom out to lunch.\n\nWhy let your child get stuck in the endless cycle of negativity surrounding death? Find ways to honor and keep alive the spirit of the child. I\u2019m sorry for your loss so please don\u2019t let your child suffer because of your selfishness.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t the one who lost a child and it sounds like your friend hasn\u2019t had time to really heal yet. I understand wanting to help your child but maybe do that WITHOUT your friend.", "YTA, your friend has lost her child, her other children have lost their sibling. The world doesn't revolve around you or your child, I'm sorry to break it to you but you two are so far down on her priority list you barely exist right now. Figure out a way to deal with your daughters grief of losing her friend on your own, it's not her responsibility to look after your child as well.", "YTA.  The grieving mother is not the right person to give support to your daughter.  Just because your daughter and her friend were close does not mean your daughter is entitled to have access to the mother during this time.  Give the family space.  Right now the mother needs to focus on her own grief and helping her other children to process their grief.  Your daughter needs her own support system outside of the grieving family.", "Yes YTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry but who does this affect more? Your daughter or the actual mother? Your friend lost her child and has other children and you expect her to drop everything so she can bring your kid to her son's grave and manage her grief?\n\nShe has other kids of her own and hasn't had the time to grieve herself. OP, show some empathy because your friend lost her child which is way more impactful than your daughter losing her friend. They are both horrible situations to experience but a parent losing their child is an aboslute nightmare to experience", "YTA. This poor woman is barely hanging on by a thread, facing the worst thing any parent could ever face while still trying to give her other children what they need, and you somehow lack the basic human decency to not add to her pain and burden. Your daughter's grief is NOT this woman's responsibility, and it's hideously insensitive of you to try to put that burden on her in any way, shape, or form.\n\nIf you want to be there for your daughter, that's great - you should be on your knees thanking whatever deity you may believe in that you still HAVE your daughter, because God knows your friend would literally give anything to still have her child here to support through things, but back the fuck off your friend's ass and realize you are making her pain WORSE.\n\nOnly if your daughter is as selfish as you are would she not understand that some days Friend's grief is too strong for her to respond if you simply explained that to her.\n\nAs for the cemetery, you could have called them to ask where his grave is or even gone to findagrave (which you'd have found if you'd have even made an attempt at googling) to see if his grave location has been listed there yet. There are ways to support your daughter without burdening your friend, but you somehow think it's better to push more burden on her.\n\nIf I were her, you'd never hear from me again.", "Wow. YTA.", "You are most definitely TA", "YTA. Get your head out of your ass.  Do you honestly believe your daughter\u2019s grief and sorrow outweigh that of the mother and siblings? If your daughter needs support, find a therapist. Do not lean on and berate a person who is struggling to keep herself and her children emotionally upright.  You are a terrible \u201cfriend\u201d.", "YTA\n\nYou are asking way too much of your friend in which you have reached AH territory. There is no time limits on grief.

Poor mom, you guys aren\u2019t making this any easier for her", "YTA on a level beyond comprehension.  Your daughter and, therefore, her grief is YOUR responsibility and obligation, not anyone else's.  She wants to go to the grave site that's understandable, but just expect the mom who lost her son to stop drop and be at your beck and call to tend to your daughters emotions is asinine.  You are demonstrating to your daughter entitled selfish and quite honestly disgusting behavior traits. Please stop that.   You owe your friend a sincere apology.   Stop letting your daughter text her, btw, I can't believe you have to be told how incredibly insensitive this of you to do.", "YTA. You're allowed to put your daughter first, but you have NO RIGHT to ask another parent to do so. Especially because she just lost a child and has young children who are grieving also. You should be asking how you can help her and lighten her load--not ADDING to it!!\n\nShe has been a SAINT to be so patient and to respond to your daughter's texts, and to answer you honestly about her feelings rather than going off on you. That poor woman.", "As a bereaved mother myself with younger children, all I can say is that there are literally no words to describe how unbelievably selfish and heartless you have been. \n\nYou will never understand what your friend has/will continue to go through, unless you experience it for yourself, which hopefully you never will. It's highly likely she already carries her own guilt over her sons death and questions her self worth as a person and as a parent- and you will have just made it a million times worse. It isn't for you to determine when it's appropriate to 'nudge' because the answer will always be never. \n\nI am sorry your daughter is having a hard time. You need to find her a proper therapist to talk through things with and not rely on your friend. You could encourage journalling or documenting memories of her friend. There's a tonne of really helpful grief resources for children online but none of them recommened seeking support from the bereaved family. \n\nYou owe your friend a MASSIVE apology and a sincere listening ear to find out what you can be doing to help her. Don't be surprised if she doesn't get in touch with you again for a while though, her mental health is likely to have taken a huge hit from your completely inappropriate demands.\n\nEdit to add: YTA", "YTA", "You're ridiculous.", "YYTA = Yuge your the asshole.", "YTA\n\nI get that your daughter is struggling..

The only real priority she should have is to her children and herself. Can you not go to the cemetery and ask someone there where his grave is? Why does she need to be there?\n\nHow could you snap at your friend and tell her you were cutting her off until she thinks of your child too... Maybe y'all should think of her and her feelings.

His passing was traumatic for multiple reasons not course so I instantly went to be with her. My daughter and he were born 3 months apart so they were very close and she was devastated. Since then I have tried to be sensitive to my friend's needs but she has not shown my daughter that same sensitivity. I gave her a year before I started trying to gently nudge her, I accepted her missing my daughter's birthday party because she said knowing her son will never turn that age, he died just before his birthday, was too hard. She's confided in me that she's struggling because she gets no real time to grieve. She's been focused on getting her younger children through this and I do feel bad that she is having a hard time. \n\nNow onto the problem. I let my daughter text her when she misses her friend because it comforts my daughter. Sometimes she doesn't respond until the next day which tbh upsets me but I hold my tongue. Recently my daughter wanted to go to the cemetery and see him so I asked my friend to meet us there as I'm not sure where he is buried. She said she couldn't because her sons weren't wanting to see him that day and she can't leave them home alone. I snapped. I told her my daughter is struggling and she could stand to think of her sometimes too. She got quiet and told me her days consist of working and handling her children's grief and trauma and by the end of the day, she has nothing left to give to anyone else. Then she hung up and I haven't heard from her sensei. I sent her a text that I loved her but I was done communicating until she prioritized my daughter a little too. Was that really too much to ask?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. It is 100% not her job to prioritize your child and her feelings. She has her own family to think of and sounds like she\u2019s struggling.

Her CHILD died and your daughter isn\u2019t her responsibility. She TOLD you she was struggling and the only grief you can see is your child\u2019s?

Your friend is missing her son, trying to get her other kids past their loss, and show them a normalcy that she will never feel again. \n\nYour friend  doesn\u2019t have the time or energy to direct her attention to your daughter, all of her focus must be on her, and her kids. They are the ones that need her the most. If your daughter is sad, then you comfort her. DO NOT put your responsibility to mother your own child on another.  Do your job as a parent, and help your daughter yourself. \n\nAlso, responding to a text in a day, especially one that causes more grief in your friend, is not an outrageous time frame. You are lucky your friend responds at all. I would not. I would redirect this to you instead, and expect you to handle it. Your friend confided in you, that she is struggling. You seem to have completely ignored this. Did it suit you to ignore it?\n\nHonestly, if I were your friend, I would drop you in favour of my own mental health and for the sake of of the children who LOST their brother. \n\nYou have no compassion for her own loss, and only care about your daughter.

I get that your daughter is grieving but did it EVER cross your mind that having her text the parent of a child who died,  that she misses their child, may be emotionally insensitive and too much for the grieving parent to handle?\n\nYou do NOT get to rush your friend's grieving process because YOU think a year is adequate.  The first year is the year of first things without their loved one.  It's raw and emotional.  That doesn't mean \"ok it's all better now\"\n\nYou are being a horrible friend.  There's no reason SHE should prioritize YOUR daughter.  WTF....", "As Robin Williams once said: \"All it takes is a beautiful fake smile to hide an injured soul and they will never notice how broken you really are.\" Your friend is still drowning. She hasn't had any time to grieve herself, having to keep her other children's heads above water. And you come in walking all over her demanding attention from her for your daughter. As a mother, yes it is your duty to put your daughter first, but it is most definitely NOT your friend's responsibility. Reach out to her and offer to help her, rather than asking to take from her. Remember: there is no rule saying you should only grieve for so long, and this will almost certainly stay as a dark cloud over her for the rest of her life! YTA", "I hope the friend cuts OP off.

Do you hear yourself?! You think it's ok to force your friend to relive her grief just so your daughter doesn't get sad about not getting a text back immediately? Why are YOU there supporting your daughter during her grief. This is so genuinely astounding.", "You cannot be serious. \n\nHave you literally never lost someone close to you? Like EVER!?!\n\nHow on earth could you be this insensitive and selfish? YOU don't think it's a big ask because YOU DIDN'T LOSE A CHILD!!! \n\n\n This is honesty the absolute worst part I've ever seen here.", "It seems like a small thing to ask?! To ask a grieving mother to text your daughter to make HER feel better? This woman is suffering a horrible loss and taking care of her other children getting them through that same loss. \u201cIt\u2019s a small ask\u201d for her to text your daughter too?? Are you even listening to yourself? Your daughter\u2019s grief is YOUR responsibility, not hers. Be a mother. Help her and/or get her therapy. It is not on your friend to do YOUR job. She\u2019s suffered enough for goodness sakes.", "You clearly only love yourself. And your daughter as an extension of yourself.", "No, you don\u2019t.", "Robin Williams cracked jokes too.", "Except you won\u2019t do it and haven\u2019t done it. So cut the bs.", "You shouldn\u2019t need shit from her. She owes you nothing at all - get over it. She sure as hell does not need to show you were her kids grave is. Asking her to do that is some next level sick shit. You are like a vampire preying on the grieving and sucking energy out of people to feed you and the selfish brat daughter you raised.", "Agreed", "I mean, it should be common sense to not allow your daughter to text her. By expecting your friend to set the limit, you're giving more emotional work to a grieving parent.", "Really, because the one time she said no, you got angry at her. Huge YTA", "She shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cdo her best to keep that connection\u201d. You need to be a mother and handle your own daughter\u2019s grief. Both you and your daughter need to let this poor woman grieve!", "You have the emotional intelligence of a potato. YTA.", "It seems you have but then you disregarded her grief as well as your daughter. You need to talk to your daughter about respect", "Are you really this dense?", "Keep the connection on her terms, not handle your daughter\u2019s grief for you. NOT HER JOB.", "It is obvious that you are dim and maybe she knows that telling you would not help. You are just lucky she did not block you and your daughter\u2019s numbers.\n\nPlease get counseling. You seem to lack empathy and common sense and seem to be raising your child the same way.", "Sure, for herself and her daughter. Not for anybody else, apparently!", "Yes, I had a friend that made fun of people\u2019s death and signed in annoyance when I cried or if I did not want to do her a favor when I just lost someone just less than a week before she asked the favor. She expected me to shut it off so I can do a huge back breaking favor for her. \n\nFU OP", "I think she needs to apologize and leave her alone. OP can be triggering now and I bet OP\u2019s behavior and narcissistic behavior will be hard to change. She will do it again and go on about her daughter", "She better cut you off for her own well-being. You can take that opportunity to actually address loss to your child.\n\nThe lion, the witch AND THE AUDACITY.\n\nYou are a horrible friend.", "You said yourself that she didn\u2019t ask the friend to take the kids, that the friend literally showed up and took them. Prime example of a GOOD friend. Why did you never offer or take initiative? Did you think maybe she didn\u2019t want to inconvenience you and ask? Why does she have to ask you? A good friend would have done what her other friend did- offer/take initiative.", "Honey, the fact that she allowed that to happen and didn\u2019t allow you to take the kids shows this woman (thankfully) has a good head on her shoulders and is already aware of how awful you are. You are not her family. You are not \u201clike\u201d her family. Your a person who\u2019s number she\u2019s about to loose, and that\u2019s a damn good thing.", "She should not have to do her best and the fact that OP made her feel that way is ridiculous.", "I would not want to see, talk or hear from OP again", "GO TO THE FRONT DESK! They literally have people there to guide you to the right grave \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It\u2019s just as well OP didn\u2019t, since it sounds like her daughter straight up bullies the younger son.", "I would send them a gift card for meal delivery and stay away. I think going over is intrusive since OP and her daughter have been so self centered.", "So you didn't ask her first because.......? You assumed that you and a grieving mother were the same?", "SUPPORT IN. VENTING OUT.", "If you think she's never collapsed with grief, I guarantee you're not as close with her as you think you are. I hope she has some truly good friends to help her through this, and I hope you become a better person through reflecting on how much YTA here.", "She\u2019s a young teenager and you expect a grieving mother tout her ahead of her own children and her own grief? Why is she texting your friend? On the grief scale you and your daughter are way towards the bottom on this. Rather than helping your friend through this, you expect her to pick up the emotional baggage for you and your daughter too? How selfish are you? And how selfish have you clearly raised your daughter to be? Even your update is selfish! You spoke about her ongoing feelings of drowning and grief her claim you had no idea in your update? Wake up to yourself! You are a terrible friend!"]}
