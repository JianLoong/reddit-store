Waiting at the hospital is not any different than waiting at home.", "NTA. It doesn't sound safe for you to be taking care of a newborn. Not to mention that newborns, while sleeping a lot, can be care intensive for short periods of time. I hope that once she settles down and thinks about it a bit, Kara will be more understanding.", "NTA. Better to wait a bit to find alternate childcare than risk an injury to a baby if you accidentally drop him etc \nShe's stressed out and hopefully once she calms down, she'll come to her senses", "NTA.   Never having cared for a baby is a good enough reason to not babysit.  You also have a disability that makes you concerned you will drop the baby.   You offered to go help with her still around to help and she declined.  \n\nI would give her time.  It may be her worrying that is making her upset easily.", "NTA. She's stressed. Hopefully she'll come to her senses/", "I think your counteroffers were reasonable given the circumstances. She should realize that this was about her child\u2019s safety and not about you being lazy. NTA.", "NTA. This was a safety issue. Her whole \u201clazy\u201d accusation doesn\u2019t have any merit. If you were just being a \u201clazy\u201d friend you wouldn\u2019t have offered to come to the hospital and help her there.", "NTA caring for a newborn is hard and you have no experience. Also, it wasn't one of those life or death situations, everything turned out fine in the end.", "NTA.  You have legitimate reasons for saying no and just think about what would happen if you actually did drop the baby.  That would be worse.  Not knowing anything about newborns and having one under your care for several hours would be nerve-wracking.  You came up with a very good solution which was ultimately rejected.\n\nKara is probably scared about what will happen with her husband and is lashing out at you.  I hope that she realizes that you were the best friend that you could be and that you get an apology.", "NTA - even if you didn\u2019t have a legitimate reason, it\u2019s not a small ask (especially with someone with no experience taking care of a child, like me). I would\u2019ve been hesitant to accept either.\n\nIt also sounds like you were willing to compromise to help her, but she wanted it her way and was unwilling to meet you half way.\n\nDon\u2019t doubt yourself. You can apologize for not being able to help, if you feel compelled to, but don\u2019t backtrack on your reasoning, because that was valid.", "NTA\n\nYou weren\u2019t comfortable about caring for a newborn when you have mobility issues. It\u2019s understandable.  Honestly, as much as people want to be in the hospital while family members have surgery, there\u2019s nothing to do but wait. Nurses can call with updates. Patients need to recover before they settle in their room, so she realistically had time to wait for her family to arrive before she went to the hospital. I can understand her wanting to be there with him. I\u2019d chalk in up to overwhelming stress of the situation. Hopefully she\u2019ll get over it and realize you had the best interest of her baby in mind.", "NAH (as of now)\n\nAs a fellow disabled person (RBKA) I lost friends who asked me to watch their kids before I got my prosthetic (I couldn\u2019t maneuver my wheelchair in the apartment I was living then so I rolled around in a doctors stool, unsafe holding a bowl of soup and moving imaging with holding a baby!)\n\nWhen the emergency situation is dealt with, and she come to her senses, forgive her. \n\nBut if she doesn\u2019t she is beginning to see your disability as you being to damaged to remain on her friends list.

Very smart to not take on something that you feel and realize that you can't do. Not wanting to (spontaniously) babysit for a baby does not make you a bad friend, Not everyone is made for that. And her losing her time is on her for not accepting your reply.", "NTA- I was so ready to rip into you because of the title but then you explained the disability thing and it\u2019s clear that you did the most responsible thing AND OFFERED AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION! You did the right thing, your friend is just super stressed and not thinking clearly. Hopefully you guys can talk this out. But just know you\u2019re not in the wrong OP!", "NTA, she wasn't the medical professional. She didn't need to rush there. Your point is valid, the baby would not have been safe with you.\n\nBut the real point is, that is not your child. You have the right to refuse custody. Anyone she contacts to ask the babysit is allowed to refuse her if they are either don't want to or don't think they should. And really it sounds like Cel is trying to stir up drama. Because Kara is not saying anything to you, only this middle man is.", "Nta. You were thinking of the welfare of the child. You are absolutely right not to watch the child if you weren't sure you could do it safely.", "Nta\n\n\nShe's showing how ableist she is.", "NTA.\n\nYou are NEVER in the wrong for saying no to any one, no matter what the situation.  Your friend fabricated this whole mess, and I could see her trying to put her child in danger on purpose with you, so she could later try to hold you responsible.  Just a feeling...\n\nAnyway, your friend has no need to even go to the hospital.  What could she have done up there?  Nothing.  It was purely illogical for her to go up there and just wait.  She should have stayed home with her own child and just waited for her husband to be done at the hospital and simply left to go pick him up.\n\nI would terminate this friendship completely with her.  She is toxic and not worth having in your life.", "If you did this to me, I would be upset too.\n\nHealth issues are an understandable impediment, but your friend was obviously in distress, and a good friend should - occasionally - go out of their way, and out of your comfort zone - to help.\n\nYTA", "You\u2019re definitely not the asshole because of you\u2019re disability and your lack of experience in taking care of the baby especially because it\u2019s new born you\u2019re being responsible by saying you\u2019re not capable of doing it! You offered to help differently and you\u2019re friend has no right to be mad at you! If with you\u2019re disability you would fall during holding the baby and there would be nobody else there to help it would be very unsafe. So no not the asshole you\u2019re just being responsible. You\u2019re friend is the asshole for not being understanding!", "Yta", "It was hard to get the exact details from her as she was talking a million miles an hour, but I *think* what I heard was that it was going to be 2hrs before surgery started as they were waiting on a specialist (he broke his arm and messed up something in his shoulder/neck - not sure if something is broken there too but I didn't ask too many questions). She wanted to get up there to be with him before he went into surgery was what I got out of it.", "And that's my thing, I think Cara will, and the poster wouldn't have even known about the best of emotion she had in that moment of stress if Cel didn't go out of her way to message the poster and try to get in her head. Why is this third person trying to start drama?", "It always boggles my mind when people try to force someone to babysit, if I'm not comfortable babysitting, why would you be comfortable with me babysitting?", "That's really what I'm hoping as well. I feel so guilty about it because I know she'd do anything for me, and for the most part I would for her too. This is just one of those things I felt I couldn't physically do.", "But do take with a grain of salt who the messenger of this was. A third party is telling you what she said, not the woman herself.", "OP is not a safe caregiver for a newborn, even in an emergency, and she knows it, she did the right thing. OP's friend would be a lot more upset if OP had said yes and something awful had happened.", "OP is literally disabled and has a hard time walking. The baby is barely a month old  and will need to be picked up at some point. WHY would you want someone who has trouble walking, carrying your defenseless baby around?? If OP goes down so does the baby, possibly ON the baby. Then what??", "I will not give my child to someone who for ANY reason cannot safely take care of my child. That mom had an emergency alright. If Op dropped her child, that will be 2 emergencies. I just have to believe that she is too stressed to think through her expectation of Op right now. \n\nYou on the other hand, I just believe you like the idea of your own sainthood.", "No need  to feel guilty  you did  the best for the both of you : you and the baby. \nNta"]}
