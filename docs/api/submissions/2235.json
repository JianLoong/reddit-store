Put the kid in the carrier if you need to make a bottle and leave them there while you move alone. \n\nAsk her for a baby lesson and to help you see whether it's workable to care for a child without walking.\n\nI think it's probably doable, but I understand this is also a problem of confidence and inexperience.  \n\nIf you don't even want to try, no judgment at all.

All I could think of is the 1001 different ways I could mess everything up.", "That could depend on where you live. If there's an RSV or flu outbreak in the area then they've probably spent the last few weeks being told to keep that baby away from crowds.", "Hope so.

OP, I think your friend is being unfair.", "When i had my surgery back in may, the hospital kicked my husband out lol  cause of covid, no one was allowed in the waiting rooms.  He couldnt even come down to the OR waiting area. I told my husband \"just go to work, they will call you when im out\" He went to work. \n\nMy surgeon called him, surgery went good, but they were having a hard time waking me in recovery. \" I originally woke up and had no clue who i was or why i was there, but my stomach hurt really bad so two nurses shot both my IVs with pain meds and i went back to sleep lol\" \n\nMy husband waited to come over till i was in my room. i didnt see the point of him being bored waiting for me", "Yeah I'm not mad at all.

I'm sure with just having a baby that made her feel way worse than it would have.", "Toddlers are more trouble than new borns.", "your NTA. I give you a ton of credit for being honest and telling her you dont feel comfortable taking care of a newborn.  I feel that way still and I've raised my friend's kids from newborn to older!  its scary! \n\nSadly you do have this disability. you didnt feel comfortable. She should have respected that. Like you said, what if you fell while holding the baby?? you did the right thing. You didnt feel comfortable. If I was her, and you told me you didnt feel comfortable taking my newborn, id respect that.", "I'm disabled too and it's honestly for the best you said no. What if she guilted you to say yes and something happened? \n\nI refuse to babysit anyone under potty trained (is that the term for kids? Lol) age. Because I can do things in an emergency with short spurts of energy but there's no way I could change a diaper or carry/lift the kid (while standing up) and still care for the kid after. I also only ever had experience with 2 year olds and older when I was able bodied so I wouldn't feel comfortable dealing with younger with my disabilities now.", "Even while stressed she didn\u2019t have to insult you trying to make it seem like you were slighting her for your \u201cexcuses\u201d aka legitimate disability. In the heat of the moment she minimizes you and treated you with contempt. I\u2019d have a hard time not getting an apology over being realistic over baby\u2019s safety. Friend is probably more ableist than you realize if you\u2019re okay not getting an apology.", "Toddlers run and you can't turn your back on them, ever. It's like harboring a pet raccoon.", "The baby is 4 weeks and probably hasn't had all its vaccines. Never a good idea to take a new born to the hospital.", "NTA. Your reasoning was incredibly correct and fair. I hope when she calms down she's kinder and frankly should be apologetic for what she said, that was a low blow.", "NTA. Why does she have to be at the hospital while he's in surgery?", "NTA - Your concerns are valid ones!", "NTA and your friend is TA for not understanding that you could not watch her child because of the limp and a chance that you could fall.  It's like she didn't care at all.  She is not a friend if she dismisses this fact.  She can be mad all she wants, but she needs to understand that you cannot watch an infant much less run after a toddler when that child gets older. Tell her to get over herself.", "NTA. Babies *do* have to be held and carried quite a bit, between feeding and changing diapers. You even offered a compromise, and all in the name of the child's safety. Here's hoping this is just her being post-partum, tired, and stressed/scared, because her comments and her attitude are rough.", "NTA\n\nI have a work related injury/disability. My left leg will just shut off-it's random, and I don't pick up grandkids, or even puppies. Also due to the medications (ototoxic) I lost any normal balance I had, and can fall over backwards, also at random. I don't carry expensive items (my laptop gets a dangerous trip to my chair). \n\nYou considered the risk to the baby, and declined, wisely. I'm hopeful your friend will come to realize that. Disabilities don't vanish when they inconvenience someone. It is hurtful when someone accuses us of 'using it' as an excuse.", "NTA. Your reasons for not babysitting are completely valid.", "I think she said something about it being 2hrs before surgery was going to happen and she wanted to her there before he went in to see him", "Yeah I take pain meds and muscle relaxers every day. I don't think what I take makes my balance any worse, but it's always a possibility. It def can make me extremely tired though.", "You are fine. I would much rather someone told me honestly they did not feel capable of watching my infant. It would\u2019ve been much worse if you were holding the baby and your leg gave out.", "How about sitting down with Cel and going through all these infant care questions.  How to diaper, what to feed, how to feed, how to put infant down for a nap, basic emergency health/safety, etc. \n\nI think Cel is in a better headspace for a long conversation about infant care.  She'll be able to discuss this in detail.  Kara is going to be very stressed for weeks (at least) between her husbands emergency/recovery/care and caring for her first infant without parents nearby to assist.\n\nYou and Cel can determine if and when you're able to care for a newborn.  When you figure that out, then you can go to Kara, when she's ready to talk, and explain what you are, and are not, able to do in regards to infant care.", "Meh ..with it being flu season, she likely would have been warned to avoid crowds and large gatherings. Plus lots of hospitals still aren't letting kids visit because of C*vid. Not saying it excuses her behavior but just wanted to point out that taking him with might not have been an option.", "NTA,  you have a disability that could cause harm to a newborn.  I have an issue where I can just be walking along and something in my back will \"snap\" and my legs give out, honestly it feels like a rubber band snapped across my back, and I  am unable to stand or walk without support.  I've raised my children and helped with many more.  I would be afraid to take on a newborn now because of the same fear you feel.", "Info. \n\nWhy were you the go-to first instead of Chel? \n\nWhy couldn't you go to sit with the baby while your friend went to the hospital ASAP and continued to find a better sitter once there? She could have set up everything needed so you didn't even have to get off the couch while tending the baby.\n\nTotally get not wanting to be responsible for the baby for an extended amount of time. But there is a middle ground.", "NTA. I am so sick ans tired of people who have had babies suddenly feeling entitled to dump said baby on everyone. It takes a village, bbla bla. Unless you participated in creation of said baby or are legally responsible for said baby, why the fuck is the baby suddenly someone's else problem? Yes, it's an emergency, but I fail to see why you should be ganged up upon.", "NTA. You had genuine and very valid concerns. \n\nAlso why  the heck didn\u2019t she call the friend who actually have and knows how to care for kids first?", "That\u2019s a bit of BS on the waiting thing, and factually untrue. At the hospital, you can see your loved one, either in or fresh out of the recovery room. You can consult with doctors. Get an update from someone that checks on your loved one, instead of having to wait for a brief call.", "This. I don't see why she needed to stay at the hospital with husband. He's a grown man at a hospital with nurses, he'll be okay. \n\nIt's weird that she didn't stay home with her baby honestly.", "But taking it to a home with kids is better?", "NAH. If this is a consistent thing, then she would be th AH but this happened right after she found out the *father of her 4 month old was in an accident and needed surgery.* For everyone that thinks she's an AH for how she responded or 'you would act differently,' you *don't know how you'll respond under that pressure*. Your friend is right, just give her a moment to breath. Hopefully she'll get why she was out of line. \n\nAlso, good on you OP for knowing and insisting on staying within your abilities. If you know you fall sometimes due to your injuries, then you should not be caring for a newborn that will need to be carried.", "NTA", "Yes. At the hospital, you don't know what kind of things are floating around. At least At a friend's house, you know them and if the kids are sick, you can keep them away from the baby. It's not ideal but it's better than a hospital. The hospital  is where si k people go.", "Weird that her husband was in an accident and you\u2019re disabled similarly due to an accident and she\u2019s asking you of all people. Does she not have other friends? NTA.", "NTA it takes courage to know when to say you aren't able to do something.", "I recognise that support can be really helpful, but in the most recent years of my life:\n\nI gave birth without the physically close support of my husband, because our son needed him more than I did.\n\nMy husband dealt with a sudden urgent hip surgery without my immediate availability, because he needed to be able to trust that his partner was capable of carrying the load of the family in his absence.\n\nWe were both unavailable for a few days. That's kind of why humans like to find partners...\nShe's an AH and you aren't", "Newborns are DELICATE and OP wasn't comfy taking that risk with such a fresh baby. OP, NTA and good on you for open and clear communication."]}
