{"id": 4332, "submission_id": "zh1rj3", "title": "AITA for not wanting my daughter to wear heels to a wedding because she will look taller than me?", "selftext": "My (44M) daughter (16F) has always been a nice girl that is a little shy and never causes any trouble. She is great at school and very talented in many activities. She has a group of like-minded trustworthy friends but has never been involved with boys or go to parties late at night. My wife's niece is getting married and she asked my daughter to be one of her bridesmaids. I thought she was maybe a little too young for that but ultimately didn't protest. They issue is that as part of her attire for the wedding she is expected to were high heel shoes.\n\nI'm only 5'6\" tall and I have a deep trauma related to my height because of all the bullying that I suffered for years in the hands of my brothers with the approval of my now deceased father. I only started to get better after finishing college. It took me years of therapy and going no contact with almost all my family to be able to mostly leave all that behind. They fully made me belive that no woman would ever like a man as short as me to the point I never had a romantic relationship until I met my wife at 25. But I am not still fully in control of my emotions related to this issue, in particular I have never been able to stop the phobia I have towards women that are taller than me. My wife is 5'4\" tall and my daughter is currently 2-inches taller than her mother. That makes her almost exactly the same height as me. I never expected her to be so tall but I have been able to remain mostly calm about it. I think knowing her since she was a baby and watching her grow myself helped my brain to humanize her and not seeing her now as I see other tall girls.\n\nSince she stopped growing a couple of years ago, I have been silently preventing my daughter to wear heels or any kind of shoes that make her appear taller than me. There has been no real problem with this because she has never had any serious interest in wearing those things until this wedding situation. I know that even just seeing her in front of me with heels, being taller than me, would be triggering to point of making me cry if not worse.\n\nAll this will be specially terrible in a big family event like the wedding. Everyone will think that she is taller than me and I rationally know most people won't care buy I think I might really have a panic attack from the embarrassment that will be happening in my mind. I tried to convince her to not wear the heels but this time she really wants too and it is not interest in what I said. My wife thinks that if it is such a problem for me I should just not go to the wedding but I think that is unfair. I don't like feeling excluded and this would  be practically as if they excluded me because of height, which would feel specially pinful for me. I have been talking to both of them about these but it has been proven useless. And now they have even start to act tired and angry any time I bring up the subject. My daughter in particular says I am making her feel bad and not allowing her to enjoy being a bridesmaid.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1670603552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zh1rj3/aita_for_not_wanting_my_daughter_to_wear_heels_to/", "score": 710, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I stand up straight and am proud of who I am. I want that for you and your daughter.I'm over 6' tall in heels and my husband loves it. I'm taller than him even without heels and if anyone comments on it, we both can have a laugh about how hung up people are about me being tall and him being short, as if that has been an impediment to what has been a wonderful marriage.  \nEDIT: and it occurs to me that you are training her to not want to date shorter men by showing her there is something wrong with the woman being taller.

Don't ever make her feel like she has to make her personal fashion or appearance choices  based on a man's insecurities.

This is YOUR trauma NOT HERS. She\u2019s not going to be 16 forever. Will you be traumatized and humiliated if she elects to wear them at her own wedding one day? The quicker you get over this the better because she\u2019s not getting any shorter and banning her from heels is ridiculous. Also 16 is not too young to stand in a wedding.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy (44M) daughter (16F) has always been a nice girl that is a little shy and never causes any trouble. She is great at school and very talented in many activities. She has a group of like-minded trustworthy friends but has never been involved with boys or go to parties late at night. My wife's niece is getting married and she asked my daughter to be one of her bridesmaids. I thought she was maybe a little too young for that but ultimately didn't protest. They issue is that as part of her attire for the wedding she is expected to were high heel shoes.\n\nI'm only 5'6\" tall and I have a deep trauma related to my height because of all the bullying that I suffered for years in the hands of my brothers with the approval of my now deceased father. I only started to get better after finishing college. It took me years of therapy and going no contact with almost all my family to be able to mostly leave all that behind. They fully made me belive that no woman would ever like a man as short as me to the point I never had a romantic relationship until I met my wife at 25. But I am not still fully in control of my emotions related to this issue, in particular I have never been able to stop the phobia I have towards women that are taller than me. My wife is 5'4\" tall and my daughter is currently 2-inches taller than her mother. That makes her almost exactly the same height as me. I never expected her to be so tall but I have been able to remain mostly calm about it. I think knowing her since she was a baby and watching her grow myself helped my brain to humanize her and not seeing her now as I see other tall girls.\n\nSince she stopped growing a couple of years ago, I have been silently preventing my daughter to wear heels or any kind of shoes that make her appear taller than me. There has been no real problem with this because she has never had any serious interest in wearing those things until this wedding situation. I know that even just seeing her in front of me with heels, being taller than me, would be triggering to point of making me cry if not worse.\n\nAll this will be specially terrible in a big family event like the wedding. Everyone will think that she is taller than me and I rationally know most people won't care buy I think I might really have a panic attack from the embarrassment that will be happening in my mind. I tried to convince her to not wear the heels but this time she really wants too and it is not interest in what I said. My wife thinks that if it is such a problem for me I should just not go to the wedding but I think that is unfair. I don't like feeling excluded and this would  be practically as if they excluded me because of height, which would feel specially pinful for me. I have been talking to both of them about these but it has been proven useless. And now they have even start to act tired and angry any time I bring up the subject. My daughter in particular says I am making her feel bad and not allowing her to enjoy being a bridesmaid.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is *your* job to do that.\n\nWhat will you do if it's her wedding? Assuming she has a traditional wedding, she'll likely be in heels.

If he just ignored it, let it go and didn\u2019t say anything -nobody would probably even notice.\nEdit to add:\n\nOP- the smart, brave and grown up thing to do would be to get used to her wearing heels now before the wedding so it\u2019s not a shock.

There are so many stories by men that can\u2019t find a partner and blame women as a collective for it. Or men like OP that had something bad happen to them and he dehumanizes all women with the attributes but not men with attributes of his bullies. On the other hand I never heard stories of women not finding a partner and blaming men as a collective. Also sooo many women are assaulted by men, yet they are still able to see men overall as humans. Why is it so easy for men to dehumanize women? Why don\u2019t women do the same?

There is a lot of media out there about women wanting a tall guy, it's worsened due to dating apps where men under a certain height don't get any matches at all because they're auto filtered out of searches. Some men can't handle this if they're unlucky in love and start to believe it's only their height - once they're able to move past that, things turn around for them generally, but it's a body issue that people can have and it's valid.\n\nI'm not defending OP in the least here because he has some serious trauma that he's projecting onto his daughter and absolutely should not do that - but as someone who is of similar height as OP and dealt with this kind of thing when I was a teenager, it's not unusual or uncommon that it's more of a response against taller women than taller men.\n\nETA: I feel I need to add here that understanding an event or phenomena and explaining that DOESN'T equate to accepting or excusing it.
