I never do my bed because it is bad when you have a house dust allergy.\n\nBut you requested a small and easy task and he refused to do it. He is 13 and you seem to invest a lot of time to drive him to his hobby. So valid to request a small task from him. If he refuses to do them, that is his choice he made. Not every parents would drive their kids for hours to another place.", "NTA  \n\n\nHe calls you horrible names and refuses to behave you worry about making him miss some tournament? I think he's the one being an asshole.", "NTA, you\u2019re showing him consequences for his actions. Very simple.", "NTA, he could have made his bed in about 3 minutes but he chose not to go to lacrosse. \n\nBut if you want to teach your 13 year old to be more responsible then, where possible, you should focus more on natural consequences rather than punishment. \n\nLike, if you want him to learn to do chores and house cleaning and not going to lacrosse is going to be the consequence then make him responsible for doing his own lacrosse laundry and keeping his gear maintained, organized, and put away when he\u2019s not using it. You can help him as he learns to do all this well but he can be responsible for taking the lead, and then if he has no gear for his games then not going is a natural consequence, not an arbitrary punishment. \n\nAnd there\u2019s absolutely not enough info here for me to draw any real conclusions, but if he has a long-term pattern of not doing things that only end up self-sabotaging things he really cares about consider talking to his pediatrician. This could definitely be teenage defiance, particularly if this kind of behaviour started with puberty, but I was a kid who would ruin my whole weekend by not cleaning my room. It wasn\u2019t that I refused to, it was that I couldn\u2019t- it literally felt impossible, and I could spend huge amounts of time and energy agonizing over not doing it, way more than it would take to actually do it. Then in my 30s I finally got diagnosed with ADHD and so much of stuff like this from my childhood made sense.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him a choice and told him the consequence beforehand and he made his choice. Thats an important lesson to learn. Calling you names is disrespectful without any question.\n\nMaybe he doesnt fully understand how much efford you put into his hobby and including him directly into the tasks that have to be performed might be an idea or put some of the tasks directly on him? When it comes to his teammates maybe make it clear that lying to them about the reasons hes not comming is not getting him far and that you would have no problems telling the truth, that could get him into a position to think about it for the future.", "ESH\n\nYou did all his Lacrosse laundry and then flipped out over the bed.  Punishments should relate to the thing that was wrong.  Not making the bed shouldn\u2019t have the unrelated consequence of not going to lacrosse.\n\nThis is years of poor punishment in the making.  You need to start by having clear expectations communicated in advance and consistent consequences.  \n\nNot yelling make your bed or your not going.", "YTA.\n\nSo very, very much YTA.\n\nYou made him let his team down and miss an already scheduled event because he hadn't done a trivial chore that doesn't even matter?\n\nI am a cardiologist in private practice. I seriously want you to know that I am a highly successful person by any reasonable metric and I have not made my bed since I was ten.\n\nConsequences for childhood misbehavior need to be a) proportionate, b) *not* something that involves showing your child *through your own actions* that keeping commitments is optional, and c) not punishing other people who weren't involved because you don't think other people matter.\n\nSeriously. Over an unmade bed you chose to inflict an outsized punishment, demonstrate that **you, OP, do not keep your commitments**, and cause problems for an entire team.\n\nWhat a wonderful role model you aren't.", "Well, you 1. tried to teach your son responsibility by blowing off a commitment that affects other people and 2. are soliciting strangers on the internet to call your 13 year old an asshole, so obviously YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
