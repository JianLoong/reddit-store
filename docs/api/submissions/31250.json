I never do my bed because it is bad when you have a house dust allergy.\n\nBut you requested a small and easy task and he refused to do it. He is 13 and you seem to invest a lot of time to drive him to his hobby. So valid to request a small task from him. If he refuses to do them, that is his choice he made. Not every parents would drive their kids for hours to another place.", "NTA  \n\n\nHe calls you horrible names and refuses to behave you worry about making him miss some tournament? I think he's the one being an asshole.", "NTA, you\u2019re showing him consequences for his actions. Very simple.", "NTA, he could have made his bed in about 3 minutes but he chose not to go to lacrosse. \n\nBut if you want to teach your 13 year old to be more responsible then, where possible, you should focus more on natural consequences rather than punishment. \n\nLike, if you want him to learn to do chores and house cleaning and not going to lacrosse is going to be the consequence then make him responsible for doing his own lacrosse laundry and keeping his gear maintained, organized, and put away when he\u2019s not using it. You can help him as he learns to do all this well but he can be responsible for taking the lead, and then if he has no gear for his games then not going is a natural consequence, not an arbitrary punishment. \n\nAnd there\u2019s absolutely not enough info here for me to draw any real conclusions, but if he has a long-term pattern of not doing things that only end up self-sabotaging things he really cares about consider talking to his pediatrician. This could definitely be teenage defiance, particularly if this kind of behaviour started with puberty, but I was a kid who would ruin my whole weekend by not cleaning my room. It wasn\u2019t that I refused to, it was that I couldn\u2019t- it literally felt impossible, and I could spend huge amounts of time and energy agonizing over not doing it, way more than it would take to actually do it. Then in my 30s I finally got diagnosed with ADHD and so much of stuff like this from my childhood made sense.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him a choice and told him the consequence beforehand and he made his choice. Thats an important lesson to learn. Calling you names is disrespectful without any question.\n\nMaybe he doesnt fully understand how much efford you put into his hobby and including him directly into the tasks that have to be performed might be an idea or put some of the tasks directly on him? When it comes to his teammates maybe make it clear that lying to them about the reasons hes not comming is not getting him far and that you would have no problems telling the truth, that could get him into a position to think about it for the future.", "ESH\n\nYou did all his Lacrosse laundry and then flipped out over the bed.  Punishments should relate to the thing that was wrong.  Not making the bed shouldn\u2019t have the unrelated consequence of not going to lacrosse.\n\nThis is years of poor punishment in the making.  You need to start by having clear expectations communicated in advance and consistent consequences.  \n\nNot yelling make your bed or your not going.", "YTA.\n\nSo very, very much YTA.\n\nYou made him let his team down and miss an already scheduled event because he hadn't done a trivial chore that doesn't even matter?\n\nI am a cardiologist in private practice. I seriously want you to know that I am a highly successful person by any reasonable metric and I have not made my bed since I was ten.\n\nConsequences for childhood misbehavior need to be a) proportionate, b) *not* something that involves showing your child *through your own actions* that keeping commitments is optional, and c) not punishing other people who weren't involved because you don't think other people matter.\n\nSeriously. Over an unmade bed you chose to inflict an outsized punishment, demonstrate that **you, OP, do not keep your commitments**, and cause problems for an entire team.\n\nWhat a wonderful role model you aren't.", "Well, you 1. tried to teach your son responsibility by blowing off a commitment that affects other people and 2. are soliciting strangers on the internet to call your 13 year old an asshole, so obviously YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Finally, one day, he called her a female dog (you know the word), and my mom LOST IT. She screamed at him, swore at him and called him horrible names. He was stunned.\n\nShe went on strike that week: no laundry, no cooking, no rides anywhere. If we wanted clean clothes or food, we had to take care of it ourselves. There was food in the pantry, but we had to make it. And we had to walk everywhere, even at night after sports practices or club meetings, though other parents would see us & give us rides. (This was a pretty safe area.)\n\nI'd been doing my own thing for a while, but my mom had really babied him - and he was older. I think the name-calling was a wake-up call, that she was giving and caring and getting nothing but disrespect.\n\nShe kept it up all week with him. Anytime he asked her for anything, or even spoke to her, he was greeted with swearing and name-calling. Otherwise, she just completely ignored him. One afternoon, she got a phone call from the school about the try-outs for next year's sports teams, and she declined all of them. He overheard her and freaked out, but she turned around and said, \"I am not doing more more single [swear word] thing for a disrespectful [swear word].\" Then she left the room.\n\nHe had been giving as good as he got the first day, but as the week wore on, he was getting confused and upset. When my mother unilaterally pulled him from sports, he got really scared. He started crying and sobbing, but my mother wouldn't discuss it.\n\nA day later, my brother was still a wreck. My mother went to his room and said, \"Are you ready to discuss a few things?\" He said yes. But there was no discussion. She just said that there would be no more disrespect at all. She would let him try out for sports (there was still time), but any swearing or name-calling and she wouldn't just pull him off teams but either send him to our father or emancipate him. Oh, and everyone had to keep doing their own laundry and make at least one meal a week for the family.\n\nHe just said, \"Okay.\" And he stuck to it, especially after she showed him all the legal doc's prepared for either choice. He knew she'd do it.\n\nSo OP, go nuclear on your kid. This behavior needed to stop yesterday.", "I\u2019m actually more appalled by the way he spoke to you than I am by the lack of bed-making.

School and chores only for the foreseeable future.", "NTA. You should not tolerate your son calling you names or trying to go around a negative reinforcement you set (by calling his friends for rides). \n\nAlso, this is his sport and he's 13.

Please fix that now for your own sanity and for the poor woman (or man or human) he eventually ends up with.", "NTA.  He just refused to do it and thought you would let him go to the tournament.  FA and FO.  It is not like he had to clean the house. It literally takes 2 minutes to make the bed.

The fact he called you that horrible name and tried to undermine you by hitching a ride with his friends is a no-no.", "NTA, if my kids spoke to me like that, they'd be off the team and be grounded with no electronics until their potty mouth cleared up.", "NTA\n\nThat is the only way to get through to him that he needs to take his responsibilities seriously and fulfill them in a timely and quality manner. If you let him blow you off now, it will only get worse over the next few years.\n\nAnd, frankly, I would call his coach and let him know exactly why your son missed the tournament. A GOOD coach would read your son the riot act and explain to your son how HE let the team down by being lazy and having an attitude... and to never again blame you for his own failures or be so disrespectful to you again.\n\nAnd you can tell your son that if he wants to have that attitude, he can be the one to wash his own laundry and prep his gear... and, frankly, he should be doing it anyway. Certainly, he can spend Friday night before the next tournament doing just that.", "Nta this is tje definition of 'fuck around, find out'.

There is no way in hell we would have done this to our parents. Do you call them such names?", "NTA\n\nStick to your guns.

Making a bed takes thirty seconds. Not much of an ask. NTA", "Playing sports is considered a hobby and a privilege! If your teen wants to be disrespectful then he forfeits his privilege to participate in said hobby. He sounds like he feels he is entitled (as most kids do these days) to do or say as he pleases but actions have consequences and he found that out the hard way. I played competitive select softball where I traveled around the US. I remember thinking at 16 how grateful I was because of the 1000s of dollars my parents spent on me a year to play, travel and have the best equipment/uniform (shoot our uniforms alone were like $500).

Necessary chores such as taking care of critters, prepping food etc are one thing as there are consequences to them not getting done. No snapping beans no food. No feeding the critters well that\u2019s not good for them. A pointless task is another. Had it been chores such as his equipment or laundry. I could see the point in letting life teach him a lesson.

Why waste energy fighting about it.", "NTA, your son has no discipline without that he will never achieve anything.\n\nIncrease his chores.", "[removed]", "NTA.
