She wants to parent. All of us are desperately trying to talk her out of it and to explore her...other options. She is willing to hear us out but hasn't changed her mind. In an effort to show her the reality of her situation, all the moms in our family are making kind of a motherhood storybook so she can see all the challenges and struggles that would come with parenthood. \n\nMy sister Laura thinks we should leave her alone, but she's heard about the book and wants to be included, to which the response was hell no. Nobody wants Laura to talk because, quite frankly, her experience is...a fantasy land. \n\nShe got pregnant at 19 by her 20 year old boyfriend. They were both broke, but he had a trust fund from his parents that couldn't be accessed until he was 25. His grandparents, who were his functional parents, were furious, but decided to take the view that since they only had about 5 years of capacity left and needed him to be the guardian of their special needs daughter within the next two years, their options were to either withhold money to the bitter end but ultimately be funding them, in a much worse situation with built up resentment, or fund them now and make it the best situation possible while still being able to guide things.\n\nThey chose the former. They made them stay in college and get married, but they got insane funding. A free condo, paid for college for both, nannies, cars, even groceries and baby supplies. They were in contact and vocal to the point that even 10 year old me was aware of how disgusted they were by this, but they didn't feel there was a real choice. \n\nAll this to say that honestly, in her situation, having my niece was the best option she had. She sent from being crushed by loans to being 26 before she ever saw even an electric bill, not that she had to worry about how to pay it. She's never had to pay rent, or have a real budget for groceries. Yes, she's now the guardian to their special needs daughter as well, but she is higher functioning (10-12 yo mental age), and she's in daycare from 9-5 and works mornings on Saturdays, so it's not some extreme burden. \n\nWe don't want her telling this because it will give our cousin unrealistic views of what's going to happen. She's offended by this because she should be able to talk about what she experienced, good and bad. We think she should be grateful and understand that her 1% experience is just that.", "created_utc": 1679059833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tr6jp/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_has_no_room_to/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let me get this straight\u2026 Because you couldn\u2019t convince your adult niece to get an abortion, you are now actually creating a book bashing motherhood by only pointing out the negative side of raising children, but you don\u2019t want your sister to be involved because her negative experiences weren\u2019t as bad as yours??? This is seriously so f\u2019d up. Leave your niece alone, you sound irrational and delusional.", "Yta. Stop gatekeeping motherhood. Yes, hers isn't usual, but still no less valid than yours or anyone else's in the family. Your controlling the narrative to get the outcome you desire", "YTA. Your cousin is a mother of two children, one of them being special needs. You wrote nothing about how loving or nurturing she is with her children. You sound really, really jealous and petty.", "Who made you and your other family members the gatekeepers of motherhood? Everyone's situation is different,  doesn't make them good or bad parents because of it. \n\nYou're not trying to help your cousin,  you're trying to force her into a choice she doesn't want to make because you believe you know better than her. Please don't give her the motherhood horror storybook you're creating, it's a horrible idea.  \n\nTake a step back and stop judging your fellow mothers. YTA", "YTA for trying to demoralize your pregnant cousin about the option of motherhood. Her body, her life, her choice. And yes, your sister should get to talk about her experience. Just because she was monetarily taken care of doesn't mean that parenting her child was easy, fun, or a 1% experience. Parenting is more than having the money.", "YTA this actually comes off, sounding both jealous and patronising, that she is in charge of a special needs child, puts her way ahead of you as a parent. I also dont understand why you are butting in, when it comes to your pregnant cousin. It actually feels like you and the others, have way to much time on your hands.", "YTA - You're all effectively ganging up on one person to pressure her in to a decision she may not want to make, and that's just ignoring the all the stuff with Laura. Y'all need to do better and think about what you're really doing which is bullying.", "YTA purely for trying to pressure your cousin towards a choice she had decided she doesn\u2019t want to make.  I bet this \u2018motherhood storybook\u2019 will be biased too as it is being created for the sole purpose of putting her off being a mother. And you are doubly the AH for making out that your sister\u2019s experience of being a mother is any less valid than anyone else\u2019s because financial support was involved.  She clearly had to put up with shed loads of judgement from her nearest and dearest. Just ugh all round.", "Are you...are you trying to pressure your cousin into her...other options? \n\nWhy are you so set on telling her only the negatives, and none of the positives? Okay, so your sister's experience is unrealistic to what your cousin will experience. You can express that w/o making it all about the negatives. \n\nWhat happens if/when you pressure your cousin into \"other options\" if she ends up regretting it? \n\nTo carry to term, to not carry to term, to adopt out or to raise...these are all *very* personal choices. \n\nIt's okay to be realistic with your cousin, but I don't think it's fair of you to pressure her into making the choice *you* think is correct. And that's precisely what you'd be doing if you ONLY gave her the negatives & purposely left out any positives. \n\nLet your cousin make this choice. She is the one who will have to live with *whatever* choice she makes.", "YTA and your family\n\n\"Other options\" sounds like an euphemism for adoption or abortion.", "YTA. I guess the \"my body my choice\" thing only works when it's the decision you wanted.  As others said, stop pressuring her, and stop gatekeeping motherhood. She has all available information, so let her do her thing.", "YTA. Your experience is not the only relevant experience. And don't downplay your sister's struggles just because she didn't have financial challenges. Raising a special needs child is incredibly tasking. \n\nAnd making a motherhood book to get someone to have an abortion?! Just gross.", "YTA. \n\nYou are not the ultimate motherhood authority and you don\u2019t get to discount others experience. Your actions are abhorrent to be honest. Women need to support other women, you\u2019re backtracking progress with shit like this.", "YTA. I am appalled at family members ganging up to force their views on your cousin. Too bad your sister didn\u2019t suffer a lifetime of damage and shame when she got pregnant. /sarc Y\u2019all need to back the eff off your cousin.", "YTA\n\nMind your own business.", "YTA. Pro choice is not the same thing as pro abortion. You\u2019ve crossed a line to disrespecting your cousin\u2019s autonomy. I don\u2019t really care about the trust fund couple.", "I\u2019m just confused because your cousin repeatedly said no. Yet you and your band of aunts and mom think it\u2019s okay to host another intervention session and for what? To try and convince her to change her mind? What the hell is wrong with you. And it\u2019s clear you have a lot of resentment/anger toward your sister. Total AH. Mind your business and leave this cousin alone. \nYour book on motherhood is only filled with negative stories and hardships. Motherhood is hard but you\u2019re painting a picture that not everyone can relate to. Motherhood isn\u2019t terrible for everyone.", "YTA for many reasons. You\u2019re trying to make a scrapbook of why she should get rid of her baby? What the hell? In what way does your cousin\u2019s life choices have ANY effect on your own life?

Sounds like she got her life together after getting pregnant and is a responsible mother and caregiver to their special needs daughter. Stay in your own lane.", "YTA y\u2019all are basically having an abortion/adoption intervention for someone who has already made their choice AND invalidating your sisters motherhood journey. It\u2019s honestly a little sickening", "Eeeeeh, dodgy one, you should absolutely not be pressuring an adult to have an abortion, that should be her decision and hers alone. Thats the first thing.\n\nI dont like the fact that you and your family seem extremely manipulative. You want to put all the motherhood experiences in a book, apart from those that might show it in a good light.\n\nYes your sister has a very rare situation in that she was lucky with finances, but that doesnt diminish what its like to have and raise a child in any way.\n\nImo, if youve had a conversation with your cousin and said your piece, thats fine, but anymore and its bullying effectively.\n\nI also want you to think. Imagine pressuring your cousin to have an abortion, and for whatever reason later in life she is unable to conceive a child. Do you want to be responsible for that? Because you will be.", "You\u2019re making a \u201cbook on motherhood\u201d to try to convince/force your cousin into having an abortion. Let\u2019s call a spade a spade - that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Her experience is not fantasy land. The lesson from it should be look at all the supports a person needs to be successful with a pregnancy at that age.", "YTA. People can make whatever decisions they want for themselves. That includes you. For yourself. You don\u2019t get to make decisions for other people who are not your own minor children. All of the women in your family need to offer support but largely butt out and let your cousin make her own decisions.", "Your cousin says she wants to parent.  Sounds like she made her choice and you all don't want to respect her agency.\n\nYou don't get to invalidate another mother's experience, no matter how jealous and bitter you are.\n\nYTA\n\nEdited for spelling.", "YTA. Your sister is a parent, even if she had unusual circumstances that brought her there. It's cruel and exclusionary for all the moms in your family to decide she isn't 'enough' of a mother, or that her story isn't worthy of sharing. It isn't a promise, it's just the way it worked out for her.\n\nFrankly this whole 'motherhood storybook' seems really misguided - the intent is to make motherhood look as awful as possible in order persuade cousin not to keep the baby, right? Again, leaving a mother's situation that worked out actually quite well out reflects that agenda and makes the whole thing seem superficial and manipulative.\n\nLastly, I encourage you to check your judgment of your sister at the door. Regardless of the financial help she received, she did indeed face major challenges at becoming a mother at a young age, getting married, finishing school, and growing into parent and adulthood. You come across as soooo dismissive of her, I feel sad for her. Lastly, taking guardianship of a special needs child is a MASSIVE burden, even if they are fairly high functioning - without know the details of this individual, it's likely your sis will have lifelong care demands for the child, more than she would face in parenting a child without special needs. I hope you can learn some empathy.  \n\n\nEdited to clarify references to 'she'.", "YTA not your life, it\u2019s her own body and her own decisions.", "YTA. \n\nYour cousin heard you out, she knows what you have to say. To keep pushing like this is disgusting. You are trying to pressure a woman into giving up her baby or aborting it against her will. Do better.", "YTA I am sure your sister has gone through some major difficulties too. You are only looking at the financial side of things. Being a parent of a disabled child is A LOT of work. Learning that your child is disabled is difficult. Sure, your sister has lucked out on having supportive and rich in laws but she has other parts of her experience which you have dismissed completely.", "YTA. You want to give your cousin \"advice\" but you only want to give one sided advice. This is her pregnancy and her decision. Stop trying to gatekeep who she talks to about parenting. Imagine if the shoe were on the other foot and she wanted an abortion and everyone was trying to talk her out of it. You'd say that people were not respecting her choice. Sound familiar? This is not your problem. You can all make it clear that you can't help her raise her baby, should she choose to have it, but beyond that, leave her the hell alone to make the decision that SHE believes is right for her.", "YTA. Stop projecting your own regrets on the poor girl. There's a way to show the messy side of parenting without being a pusher.", "It\u2019s none of your business. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nBook idea and pressuring your cousin aside, Laura is a member of the **all the moms in the family** group.\n\nIf anything, knowing your sister's story and the context of it, and being able to compare it to the others' might highlight pain points.", "Yta. My little sister got pregnant at 16. I told her there was no shame in getting an abortion, shared my own experience getting pregnant at 18 and having an abortion at 21 and which one was more traumatic for me, and told her to really think about it. But as soon as she told me she made her mind up about keeping it I dropped the other options talk and focused on supporting her because young parents absolutely need support. They\u2019re going to go through some rough shit. \n\nSee my experience will definitely have me talking to my kid about an iud the minute she even thinks in the direction of sex, but it\u2019s also given me a lot of empathy and understanding. Once a decision has been made, that is that. One thing I do to be supportive of my sister is I let her know I\u2019m a safe space to drop off the baby. If she needs a day or a nap. She hasn\u2019t taken me up on that, but I\u2019m hoping she does soon cause I can see how hard she is working right now to get her ged and being a full time mom while her fianc\u00e9 already got his ged and started working in an auto shop and going to college. They\u2019re not living a fairytale, they\u2019re working hard. Even with both their parents still supporting them.

Your involvement here seems really controlling to me.", "Wow, gatekeeping motherhood over money. \n\nJealous much? \n\nYTA. Motherhood is a huge struggle even with all the money in the world. (EDIT TO ADD: this comment is in reference to the experience of the sister, where it still would have been challenging even with all that money)\n\nI also think YTA for trying to talk her out of it, instead of trying to talk to her about it. From the sounds of it this book sounds like a cautionary tale. I have cousins who had kids young and some of them struggled, but it changed their life!\n\nLeave some room for opinions that aren\u2019t the ones you want.", "YTA.", "NAH, but let's be clear about what's going on.

It's fine for the other members of your family to think that. You can make your case and your argument and you can dress it up with a bullshit \"storybook\" - that's all fine, as long as you say what you want to say and then leave it alone so that this girl can make her own decision.\n\nIf you don't want your sister to be involved in this - that's also fine. You're trying to convince her to get an abortion and Laura isn't on board with that. So don't invite her to participate.

I know reasonably I can't actually control that but I will always encourage them to wait a bit first because of the struggles I went through being a young mom.

Nobody wants Laura to talk because, quite frankly, her experience is...a fantasy land. \n\nShe got pregnant at 19 by her 20 year old boyfriend. They were both broke, but he had a trust fund from his parents that couldn't be accessed until he was 25. His grandparents, who were his functional parents, were furious, but decided to take the view that since they only had about 5 years of capacity left and needed him to be the guardian of their special needs daughter within the next two years, their options were to either withhold money to the bitter end but ultimately be funding them, in a much worse situation with built up resentment, or fund them now and make it the best situation possible while still being able to guide things.\n\nThey chose the former. They made them stay in college and get married, but they got insane funding. A free condo, paid for college for both, nannies, cars, even groceries and baby supplies. They were in contact and vocal to the point that even 10 year old me was aware of how disgusted they were by this, but they didn't feel there was a real choice. \n\nAll this to say that honestly, in her situation, having my niece was the best option she had. She sent from being crushed by loans to being 26 before she ever saw even an electric bill, not that she had to worry about how to pay it. She's never had to pay rent, or have a real budget for groceries. Yes, she's now the guardian to their special needs daughter as well, but she is higher functioning (10-12 yo mental age), and she's in daycare from 9-5 and works mornings on Saturdays, so it's not some extreme burden. \n\nWe don't want her telling this because it will give our cousin unrealistic views of what's going to happen. She's offended by this because she should be able to talk about what she experienced, good and bad. We think she should be grateful and understand that her 1% experience is just that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You ARE jealous!", "OK well your cousin knows she\u2019s not in that situation so any experience Laura talks about isn\u2019t going to be the same experience your cousin would have anyway. But yeah you do sound really jealous this is super weird are you OK?", "Maybe hearing about how your sister financial situation was so different from what her own situation is will give her a different perspective. She will realize she doesn't have the same financial benefits that your sister had. Also YTA for not letting your sister give her own perspective, but also for trying so hard to convince you cousin to have an abortion or give her child up for adoption. It is her choice and you are sounding like a pushy AH.", "Sometimes I get sad I didn\u2019t grow up having a sister\u2026 then I read posts like this from people like you and thank my lucky stars I only have brothers. \n\nYou sound bitter and pathetic.", "If we'd stop having kids, we wouldn't have either! Win, Win!", "Absolutely. I wish we could all agree that the best way for women to not regret their decisions is to allow them to make decisions without pressure.", "Sure but hopefully in those cases people could make up their own mind so they regret their own choices and not someone else\u2019s", "I regret having mine but a year or two later I realized that having a child at 19, first year of college with no stable income or home wasn\u2019t fair for either of us struggling", "That's honestly what came to mind since she put other options. OP seems to think that all mothers have the same experience with motherhood.", "I could only imagine how OP is going to be later on. She sounds like she'd be controlling or purposely try to harm her cousin.", "Correct. I'm talking about OP here, and not advocating for a \"pro life\" stance. My point is this is the mother's choice.", "And we make it as hard as possible in this country", "I don't think that they were implying that abortion makes you sterile. I think that their argument was more of, if you abort that baby now, then what if you can never get pregnant after that? A little bit of a stretch but maybe possible.", "It actually **is** one of the risks.", "Sorry no thats not what I meant, thats my bad grammar. I didnt mean that abortion makes you sterile I meant imagine if she becomes sterile later in life and now cant have children, she could have had the one she wanted but op pressured her out of it.\n\nAs in it would be ops fault that she didnt have the child she wanted", "I think they meant that as in what if her cousin isn\u2019t able to carry children and this baby was her \u201cmiracle\u201d baby.", "Well done!", "Edited my reply for clarity- I meant you can\u2019t invalidate the sisters experience just because she has money.", "See above, added a clarification", "So, you have no kids, and no real experience, so instead of supporting her you go full a**hole, awesome.", "This one hits hard, because I'm part of a \"it takes a village\" family. I've never wanted kids of my own. So, I don't expect to be a babysitter to any of my cousins children. If the line in the sand is drawn ahead of time there won't be any \"but we're family\" crying from a cousin expecting free childcare.", "I'm not saying it's not easier? Financially of course it is.\n\nI'm saying she's still a parent who worries about every decision she makes for her child and has been changed by being a mother.", "Have you read the post?", "Fair", "Then why are YOU saying anything to your cousin when you have ZERO experience? You don't know anything about motherhood that you can offer to your cousin.\n\nSo what makes YOU a better person than your sister to give advice to your cousin?", "Very true. When baby wakes everyone up screaming at 2 am, it doesn't care about your money or cars or lack of sleep. Baby is still going to scream.", "I'm thinking this as well. Like if the person that can make it *look* easy tell her about her struggles that might sink in instead of being told what a horrible choice they are about to make", "You've got the sister and cousin mixed up. The sister was the one who won the jackpot of baby daddies. The cousin from the way the post is worded may not be that lucky.", "Sometimes I get sad I didn\u2019t have 2 Nannie\u2019s for my baby /s", "It would be the OPs FAULT if she was infertile? A stretch.", "Yes because bringing in a child when you\u2019re one still with no income or long term plan is any better. \n\nI\u2019m all for us to have the option to choose but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to make little people suffer when they didn\u2019t choose to be here", "\"but having some means really doesn't make parenting any easier OTHER than the financial aspect.\" literally your words. I am saying it *does* make it easier in many other aspects. she isn't a mother who worries about feeding her kids, housing her kids, or who will take care of them, so she isn't worried about every decision a normal mother would.", "OP's sister has the trust fund bf/husband, not the cousin.", "Um. Have you?", "Now, I do get your point about them letting her know both the pros and cons to have her know what parenthood consists of from personal experience. HOWEVER, from the description, it sounds like OP and her family are only going to discuss the negatives, to convince the cousin to get an abortion or give the baby up for adoption. They're not coming from a place of love, at least not in the way that the cousin deserves. They just don't want cousin to have a baby.", "It would be OP\u2019s fault to have bullied her out of having a child.", "What is a \"normal mother\", though? One who struggles to pay for her child financially? \n\nSure, OP's sister is privileged in having a financial comfort to take care of her child. But she also is raising a special needs child, who has different needs than other children. So she may benefit financially and is lucky to have that comfort, but she has other struggles. And OP is assuming that her sister leaves the child with the nanny and does absolutely nothing. We don't know either way since we're only hearing one side who already has an opinion already made, but it's also incredibly dismissive to have OP assume her sister has nothing to offer their cousin in terms of experience.", "That's all the financial aspect. Obviously it affects many things but it's still just the one thing.\n\nEverything else related to parenting is just as much a concern.", "I'm speaking about average financial situations, not people who get money handed to them. she has other struggles *now*, when she didn't for several years, which is more likely the \"mother\" story she will tell the cousin. she may have \"experience\" but it's a sugar-coated viewpoint that will do nothing but harm. that's like saying \"anyone who takes an singing class can be Taylor Swift, she can teach you because she has experience!\" when obviously it's not connected to reality for most due to connections and financial means.", "but it's literally not. paid for childcare means they have more free time or can pass off the baby if they get too stressed. they don't have to worry about hiring the wrong nanny because they can pay for any of them. they don't have to sacrifice their own health for their child the way a poorer mother might. to water it down to, \"it's just money, they still have it just as hard!\" is so gross. finances affect everything. they do *not* have just as many concerns, because there are some things they don't even need to *think* about by being well-off.", "Right. So as you said money is one thing that affects MANY things.", "That's fair. I totally get that OP's sister has privilege financially and is one of the lucky ones who doesn't have to worry about how she'll pay for her child. \n\nBut OP's sister has other experiences she CAN share and I think it's unfair to shut her out just because of her financial situation. OP doesn't know what her sister will share. She could have some very helpful advice from another perspective.\n\nPlus, OP's sister seems like the ONLY one willing to also talk about the pros of motherhood while the rest of them want to shove all the shitty things about parenthood at the cousin to ensure she gets an abortion or gives the baby up.\n\nIn which case, I'd rather take the sister's advice over the rest of the family's.", "Right, so people with means just ARENT real parents in your mind? \n\nThat's what this is about. That the cousin with means has nothing to contribute about being a mother."]}
