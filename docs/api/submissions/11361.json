Jana later told me that it was rude of me to leave and Cindy had to get an Uber. I said well, I\u2019ve never met Cindy and she never talked to me.

The dig about the money just goes to show there's an element of jealousy here too.", "NTA.    Please remind Jana that the world is filled with people who make less money than she does.   There are countries where people make less in a year than she makes in a month.   That doesn't give those people the right to tell Jana what she should do with her car, her time, or her money.    If she wants to give out rides to the underprivileged, she's welcome to get herself a car and do that.  She has no right to obligate you to do it.     \n\n\nCharity should make you feel great.  Charity should not make you feel like you just got strong-armed into something you never wanted to do.", "NTA. Jana had no business volunteering you. If she, or anyone else does this, say absolutely not, never going to happen. Man or woman doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re not a taxi service!  Absolutely not!", "So your colleague volunteered you to drive a stranger home without asking if it was cool with you? Nope, definitely NTA OP\n\nJana needs to back off with that bullshit", "Users and 'class warriors' - always there to let you know that you should feel guilty for what you've earned.    \n\n\nJana was rude several different ways.  First of all,  you don't volunteer someone else to give people rides.  You wanna give out rides, get a car and do it yourself.    Second - she put OP on the spot in a very unkind way.  She could have asked privately before making OP decline in front of Cindy.", "Yep, that sounds like a \u201cHer problem.\u201d Not a \u201cYou problem\u201d \ud83d\ude06", "So what you learned is that Jane can behave like a nice person and reliable worker but under the surface she is fully capable of emotional manipulation and boundary violation.", "Op say that you are going to your bf /at your parents etc after shift and be done with the conversation. \n\nAlso tell Jana that you don't make your plans based on what she wants but on what you want and need and she is absolutely free to give Cindy a ride in her car on her time whenever she wants but to be so kind as to not make any plans for you ever again in the future \n\nNTA", "I used to give rides at work. But people started volunteering me so I quit. I told everyone no after that.", "[removed]", "Also volunteering her car, gas, maintenance and most importantly time waiting for coworker to meet up before she can leave, all I'm sure justified bc OP makes more and I'm sure they think they have \"harder\" lives bc of the choices they have made themselves but feel entitled to other people's time and money", "Right! And how tf does she know how much $$ you make and to bring that up is so rude. Like you owe them rides cause you make more money, so tacky. People be so entitled.", "So you have more money because you do different jobs? Well, who would have guessed? /s\n\nMaybe Jana and Cindy should step it up and become nurses so they can stop watching OP's pockets.", "She literally said she couldn't find them after saying no the first time to once again confirm the no and they were nowhere in sight for the shift. Its not on OP to go hunting someone down", "It pretty much sounds like OP didn\u2019t have any input in the arrangement at all so I don\u2019t think it was her responsibility to hunt  Cindy down to tell her anything.", "Yes, she did when she first told them she wouldn't be able to take her home, they didn't listen to her answer.", "Nta just say its rude to volunteer someone elses time and presume an expectation to drive them home, its not your responsibility.", "NTA you aren't paid to be a chauffeur for entitled co-workers. \n\nHow did she get to work? She can use the same way back home.", "NTA. How much you make has nothing to do with anything and is not her business. How awkward would that ride be with two people who don't know each other?  No thanks.", "NTA\nWhat's with people offering the services of others? Firstly you don't owe anybody a lift anywhere! And second, you definitely don't owe a lift to a stranger. Some people call random people they met 5 minutes ago \"friends\" so you don't have to trust that because they are \"friends\" it's all ok.", "NTA - Cindy is an adult if she wants a ride home she should have come and introduced herself and asked herself if you could carpool. someone else does not have the right to tell you want to do.", "NTA You aren't her personal flunky that she gets to command.", "NTA - this is between Jana and Cindy. Jana agreed to something, you didn't.", "Nta Jana can pay for Cindy\u2019s transportation if it means that much to her. Neither one is your responsibility. Start signing both of them up for extra shifts and work and volunteering and see how they like it.", "Not a chauffeur service.", "I used to work the same shift as my best friend when we were in the military. We lived about 8 feet apart in our apartments (great) but she wouldn\u2019t be ready when I was ready to leave (I always drove because I\u2019ve been in the car with her when she\u2019s driven, and best for me to drive, haha). But even though we were (and are) BFFs, I hated waiting for her, even if it was 10 minutes because I just want to go home after a night shift (I still did it, but I would play opera on the way home if she took too long, again, hahaha, we laugh about that). So I can totally understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to inconvenience yourself with a stranger. And what if you want to stop at the store on the way home? Soooo NTA!!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy does someone else determine who you have to get rides to? Why do they think they are entitled to your vehicle?", "Jana doesn't get to decide what you do with your time, money or car. NTA", "This.  Dead. Nuts. On.  NTA.  \"Hey, give my friend a ride.  You've known me for five minutes and I never hurt you so you can take my word for it.\"", "I get what you\u2019re saying, and I might give someone a ride from a party, if I at least had the chance to talk to them a little. Cindy is a virtual stranger to OP. \n\nPlus , a one time ride home from a party is one thing. I have a feeling this would have turned into a regular thing any time they worked the same shift.", "People can have the same job but one will have gotten raises over the years while the other is still at starting wage because they're new.", "This", "My apologies. The NTA still stands", "With friends like that, who needs enemas? \ud83d\ude01", "It\u2019s just common sense that a nurse makes more than a CNA. It really is a given that nurses make more. That in no way obligates her to give anyone a ride, whether or not she knows them!", "Why are people so rude and invoke \"boundaries\" when it would cost absolutely nothing to give people a ride, that too at 2:30am in the morning? What is wrong with everyone in this sub that is saying NTA. You clearly are an AH. If you are that stingy then split costs of the gas and parking but to leave someone in the lurch like that? Horrible behavior. Do better OP. YOU ARE THE AH!!!", "If she was Jana's friend why didn't Jana driver her home?  He she hadn't \"met\" you that evening how was she planning to get back home?  NTA but Jana needs to learn that NO means NO.", "NTA Cindy's transportation is not your responsibility.  Jana has no right to volunteer you for driving strangers home.", "NTA but Jana is extremely pushy and you should avoid her.  Jana feels bad about her friend not making enough money then she can pay for her friends Uber.   You go to work to work for your salary.  Avoid the toxic and pushy coworkers.", "Jana and Cindy are pissed about trying to overrun your schedule and vehicle. That's irony for you. NTA.", "Yeah they are of a different culture than me, and I am American born and raised so I felt like\u2014maybe it was a cultural expectation to \u201cbe generous.\u201d But the American in me was thinking more along the lines of be cautious, since I don\u2019t know Cindy. Cindy didn\u2019t talk to me at all (could\u2019ve been her personality, and Jana is usually gregarious and sweet). I just was wondering if I pulled an AH move by just leaving her after my shift. And I should clarify Jana didn\u2019t say it meanly? Which is why I was like thinking should I be more generous?", "Yep. This is \"Voluntelling\" and it's an asshole move.", "The guilting isn't okay, and I understand why you feel nervous giving a ride to someone you don't know. Honestly though I've been working in healthcare a long time, and giving rides to coworkers is something we just do, even when we don't know them well. I think the other girl is TA because of what she said and how much she pressured you, but I absolutely understand where she's coming from, thinking you'd trust her judgement since you know her.", "NTA", "NTA. One of my biggest pet peeves is people who volunteer others resources. Jana had zero right to tell Cindy you'd give her a ride and she sure as heck had no cause to have her ass on her shoulders when you didn't. Some kind of how Cindy manages to get around when you aren't around and she should continue to do so going forward.", "Jana can pay for Cindy's Uber since she wants to help. How rude that someone would just expect someone to become a chauffer at their demand.", "You only just met Jana and unfortunately I think you're going to find out she's really not that nice. Anyone who Is nice, doesn't volunteer other people for Anything, nor do they talk shit on people.", "NTA. as a nurse, when, ever, do you get to leave at end of shift? CNA's do, but nurses have to hand-off to the incoming shift, then finish notes etc, and God forbid there is a fall to document.... I never offered rides to CNA's as they would end up sitting around for an hour pouting.", "You should clarify, I think that context is important. Are they from the Philippines by any chance? If so it's likely cultural.", "OP is NTA, but there are sometimes very good reasons for people not \"stepping up\" as you put it. If they're immigrants maybe they're sending money home to their families, maybe they were nurses in their country but can't afford to go back now. Maybe they didn't have the same supports, maybe they have learning disabilities or undiagnosed ADHD, maybe they come from a lower socioeconomic status with families who don't have people who went to school. You don't know, and frankly this kind of classist bullshit is not it."]}
