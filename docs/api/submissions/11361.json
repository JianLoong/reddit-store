I have variable shifts, and this month I was on the 2pm-2am shift and Jana was on the 7pm-7am shift. Her friend was on the 2pm-2am shift, but she was not assigned to my group that night and I\u2019ve never spoken to her ever.  Jana introduced us, and then she casually mentioned that we all live in the same complex. I was like wow cool, what a coincidence. Then she said that I could give Cindy a ride home since we were on the same shift schedule. I never agreed to that and I said such (a gentle, oh I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met you, so I can\u2019t). Jana insisted oh well you\u2019re going the same way, yes you can. And I still didn\u2019t talk to Cindy during work because she was not assigned with me, and so I never got acquainted with Cindy except for this brief exchange. And I couldn\u2019t find them either when I had a free chance to reiterate I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it.\n\nAnyway at the end of my shift, I just left and didn\u2019t wait for Cindy at all since I didn\u2019t agree to give her a ride despite Jana\u2019s offer.\n\nWell the next shift, I could tell they were miffed and were talking in another language in hushed tones when I walked into the beginning of shift huddle. Jana later told me that it was rude of me to leave and Cindy had to get an Uber. I said well, I\u2019ve never met Cindy and she never talked to me. Jana said that since I knew her that I could trust her friends. She also mentioned that I earned more money so I could be more generous and that poor Cindy had to spend money on a ride home.
