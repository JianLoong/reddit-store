A few times I\u2019ve been paired with a really great nursing assistant named Jana, and while at the apartments I found out she lived there too. \n\nOne day Jana was chit chatting with another CNA I\u2019ve never met named Cindy. I have variable shifts, and this month I was on the 2pm-2am shift and Jana was on the 7pm-7am shift. Her friend was on the 2pm-2am shift, but she was not assigned to my group that night and I\u2019ve never spoken to her ever.  Jana introduced us, and then she casually mentioned that we all live in the same complex. I was like wow cool, what a coincidence. Then she said that I could give Cindy a ride home since we were on the same shift schedule. I never agreed to that and I said such (a gentle, oh I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met you, so I can\u2019t). Jana insisted oh well you\u2019re going the same way, yes you can. And I still didn\u2019t talk to Cindy during work because she was not assigned with me, and so I never got acquainted with Cindy except for this brief exchange. And I couldn\u2019t find them either when I had a free chance to reiterate I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it.\n\nAnyway at the end of my shift, I just left and didn\u2019t wait for Cindy at all since I didn\u2019t agree to give her a ride despite Jana\u2019s offer.\n\nWell the next shift, I could tell they were miffed and were talking in another language in hushed tones when I walked into the beginning of shift huddle. Jana later told me that it was rude of me to leave and Cindy had to get an Uber. I said well, I\u2019ve never met Cindy and she never talked to me. Jana said that since I knew her that I could trust her friends. She also mentioned that I earned more money so I could be more generous and that poor Cindy had to spend money on a ride home.

Someone wants a ride - they can ask.  The gall to assume that you'd wait around...", "NTA. You didn't agree so they should'nt have assumed that you were giving her a ride.", "NTA. Stay away from both of them. They are users.", "NTA. She was being extremely rude and intrusive.", "NTA. She's a stranger and the dangers of being alone with a woman in your car speak for themselves", "NTA. You are coworkers. Your obligations towards each other begin and end at work and work alone. Not rides to or from, not drinks and hangouts after, nothing. If you end up becoming friends, or something else like a ride share contract comes up, then that changes things. However, as it stands, you do not owe either of them a ride, let alone being an A H for nothing giving one.", "nta, that\u2019s super weird on their behalf, i wouldn\u2019t ever ask some random stranger for a ride. maybe if they approach you next time, tell them ur busy and aren\u2019t headed home immediately, or even ask her to pay you for the ride haha!", "> since I knew her that I could trust her friends\n\nBut you can't even trust her?\n\nNTA", "NTA - if I were in this situation and my friend asked me if I could give a lift to their friend since they're going the same way, I'd most probably agree to do so.

I like doing favors to friends and people in general but someone else promising stuff on my behalf is just exploitative. And even in the first case it wouldn't be an asshole thing to refuse.", "NTA. It was incredibly rude of your colleague to volunteer you like that. Of course the real villain here is your employer. If there's no available public transport at that time and employees are reliant on taxis then something needs to change.", "NTA\n\nPeople that do this deserve to be called out for it. Just openly say to them that you don\u2019t appreciate the entitlement. If I wanted a lift from somebody I\u2019d at least build a rapport with them first, but even then that\u2019s pretty greasy behaviour.", "NTA. Jana was being generous with your resources. You needn't put up with that. I know people, who enjoy their alone time in the car so much that it is a real imposition to ask them for a lift. I don't know if that is the case with you, but if it is, know that you are within your rights to refuse anyone a lift.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRefuse to further discuss it.

I guess your own instinct surpassed mine in this situation!", "Definitely NTA.\n\nShut that mess down. It's one thing to be friendly with coworkers, but you're not even acquiantances with Cindy. And the sheer fact that Jana tried to override your polite \"no\" should be a major flag. She's not your friend. Cindy is hers. You're simply a ticket to help, especially that money guilt trip.\n\nPersonally, I would pull back from Jana as well. If she feels comfortable enough to be entitled to your time, car, and money, then you don't need her in your work social group, nor does she needs your pleasantness. Just cool professionalism.\n\nIf they're going to bother you about rides, then perhaps make some suggestions to help Cindy: picking up more shifts, public transport, return to school to get other certifications or degrees for a higher pay grade, look into other nursing facilities for a higher wage, a career change, and/or a financial app to track spending and to readjust areas to free up money.\n\nCindy had managed to get to work without your car.
