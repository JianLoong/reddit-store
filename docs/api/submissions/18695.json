I admit I liked the idea, so I agreed.\n\nI asked a friend who lives in the close-by neighborhood (we\u2019re in Chicago) for the name of his and his wife\u2019s cleaning lady (\u201cKaty\u201d).

She tells me she has her own supplies (I need to provide a vacuum), and the first cleaning will be $140, and then every other week will be $100. This seemed reasonable, so I scheduled a time with her. She came yesterday morning and was there for just under four hours. I gave her $160 in cash (my friend advised me to tip $20 for each cleaning). She told me that wasn\u2019t enough, that she needed $180 for the first cleaning (not including the tip).\n\nI was confused and asked her did it take longer than she expected (no), was it dirtier and she had to work harder (no), did she use more supplies than estimated (no), rather after doing the cleaning, she felt that $180 for the first cleaning, and $140 for each subsequent cleaning was the new price she felt was fair.\n\nI told her that had she told me this BEFORE she started to work (she had done a walkthrough prior to start working so I could show her the apartment) I probably would have agreed to the new pricing (or asked to meet in the middle), but to spring this on me AFTER the work was done, with no real reason for it other than \u201cthis is what I think it\u2019s now worth\u201d isn\u2019t fair, and that she can take the $160, but that\u2019s all she\u2019s getting from me and I won\u2019t be using her services in the future.\n\nShe took the money, gathered her stuff, and stormed out. She called my friend\u2019s wife, and I\u2019m getting a lot of texts about them about how I\u2019m being cheap and made them look bad (how?). But to me there\u2019s the principle. She quoted a job, worked the job, and then tried to increase the price after the work was done even though she admits she didn\u2019t do more work than what she quoted for or needed more supplies than what she estimated.

Unless you got a quote and came back to her 6 months later, you did the right thing. Don't let her bully you otherwise. \n\nShe probably won't, but if she takes you to court, you have a leg to stand on. You have the quote saying it would cost $140.", "NTA.

That doesn't include  recycling and cardboard either. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you could afford it. Anyone siding with the cleaning lady can suck it.", "Nta. Any responsible service person sticks to the initial price they quoted. If they think the job is worth more then the right thing to do is give you some notice before upping the price.", "NTA.  I agree with you here.  If she wanted $180 she should have quoted that.  Suppose you got a quote on car repairs for $1000.  Suppose you took your car there and they did exactly the work they quoted, finding no extra issues once they got into the vehicle to repair it, and decided to charge $1100 at the end instead because that was fair.  Would that be okay?  I don't think so.", "Nta. You paid what you were quoted. Any adjustments to price are to be negotiated before work is done.

You didn't sign off on an official quote. It kinda sucks but I'd have let it go this first time as long as you can afford it and feel the cost is fair. Now you lost out on what is probably a great and trustworthy cleaning lady. At least that's my opinion.
