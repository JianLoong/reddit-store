Could there be any annoyance or anxiety for your wife caused by the fact that you are going to make investment in a hobby right before bringing a child into your life, when presumably, you will need to carve off more of your \"free time\" to help with the baby?\n\nI see no reason why your wife should think you are an a-hole for spending your bonus this way, but it may go a long way in your favor to reassure her that you will not be shirking your fatherly duties to game.", "NTA.  As long as you are not neglecting the needs of the baby, this is a reward that you worked hard for and should spend it to buy yourself something that makes you happy.", "NTA If you can afford the things your baby needs, treat yourself.

I get frequent bonuses at work and my husband tells me those are for me to spend on myself and enjoy.", "NTA , but don\u2019t waste the money. After the baby arrives you won\u2019t have a lot of time for gaming, unless you\u2019re a shit father.  Take your wife out for a nice dinner. By yourself something nice not less than $100, and put the rest into a savings account for baby stuff. See what you get at showers before you buy.", "NTA.  As long as there isn't something NEEDED for the family and you can afford it, spend it on yourself", "NTA - assuming all of your baby needs have been met, and there's nothing else needed at the moment.  It sounds like your wife thinks there is, you two should discuss that.\n\nHowever, I would question if now is the best time to upgrade a gaming system.  Your wife is on stress leave and pregnant, and as she progresses you're going to need to do more and more around the house, and once the baby is born, you're not going to have much free time at all.  If you upgrade now, is that system then outdated in a year or two (I'm not a gamer, I don't know).", "NTA. I just had a similar experience with my spouse but I justified it as I work hard so if I want to take a portion of my bonus & buy something (in my case a concert ticket) then so be it. Other bonuses go towards bills, Christmas, etc. You are allowed to spend this however you wish.", "NTA if you are not struggling financially! your recreation is as important as anything else, some jog others play videogames( even i with 4 kids manage to find a bit of time to play silly stupid games to disconnect:)( i m a mom) as long you are selfconstious about it and dont get lost with days on games and still help out around the house and with the baby when it comes i find it perfectly acceptable to spoil yourself a bit ( just because we become parents doesn't mean  we should just forget about ourselves and our hobbies", "NAH\n\nYou worked hard and earned it. Your wife is also right to want some of it spent on baby stuff. I think this comes down to communication and how you regularly handle your household finances. Sounds like you need to have a clear conversation about what you each want. So long as your future child isn't being neglected financially while you upgrade your gaming PC (which doesn't sound to be the case) you definitely are NTA, and so long as your wife is refusing to acknowledge that this is something you earned I don't think she is an AH either. IMO a good compromise would be keep half for you and half for the baby.", "NAH\n\nBut is this something worth having a conflict over when there's an obvious compromise to be had? Keep $250 for yourself, give your wife $250 to spend however she likes, and call it even.", "NTA", "NTA. Since it\u2019s a small amount it\u2019s not gonna make a huge dent in baby stuff. It would be a good idea to use it for baby stuff as babies are incredibly expensive. However it\u2019s ultimately up to you!", "NTA\n\nIf your finances are good, and you get regular bonuses at work, I don't see the issue in spending your 5 year $500 gift card on some computer parts. You've clearly earned it.", "NTA\n\nSince you give all of your much larger **annual** bonus to the wife, I don't see any problem with keeping a one time $500 bonus to indulge yourself.\n\nIt would only be an AH move if the baby's needs were being neglected in exchange.  I don't think this is the case here.", "I\u2019ve rewritten my response a few times. I\u2019m going soft YTA.\n\nYou two are married and about to have a child.

Do you have a savings that is comfortable enough to support all three of you if one or both of you lose your jobs? \n\nIf so, your money is your money. This is why its so important to keep your own money separate from your partner and the family as a whole. \n\nNTA.", "NTA its one bonus you got after 5 years vs the bonus you get very year that your spend on the family its really not the same I hope you get a good computer", "NTA that's a fairly small amount but it would be nice if you either split it with your wife or gave her an equal amount to spend on what she wants. It's fun to buy baby stuff but after the baby is here neither of you will be buying fun stuff for awhile. You might encourage your wife to splurge on herself a bit now too", "I'm leaning towards NTA, but it does depend  \nDoes your wife work? How far along is she? What kind of baby stuff would she spend it on? I feel there's a difference between \"a cot\" and \"baby clothes and plushies\" or \"pink paint because I'm so sure it's going to be a girl even though they couldn't see yet\"  \nI could go on here, but I mostly feel that you earned the money, you did the time, you get to spend the prize  \nPersonally I'd put at least half in savings, but your wife would spend it too  \nYou might want to consider not spending it at all as long as you're both on opposite sides of how to spend it, or going 50/50 on it if this remains a standstill  \nJust don't be too surprised when you find you don't have much time or energy for gaming when that baby comes", "YTA. For better or worse, when you marry someone and have a kid with them, *your* money quickly becomes *our* money. It's not unreasonable for a pregnant wife who has to take leave from work to want some say in how a $500 windfall is spent. \n\n>I like to game and wanted an upgrade to my gaming PC...\n\nHow nice for you. Your wife is going through a freaking pregnancy and all the discomfort, changes, and tribulations that come with that and wants to spend the money on the child she's so patiently incubating, and you want a better gaming PC. Do you see the qualitative differences there? \"But honey, I want a better gaming PC!\" is not the argument you should be having with your pregnant wife.

She wants to know you\u2019re as excited for the baby as she is. In her mind using this money for baby items may be a way for you to show that as obviously there\u2019s not much else you can do during pregnancy (which frankly sucks).\n2). The gaming system may be making her wonder exactly how much you plan to be gaming when the baby is here. Men ignoring responsibilities is a *huge* problem for a lot of dads and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s you but it also may have crossed her mind.\n3). Back to point #1, her hormones are changing, you\u2019re growing your family, she has to figure out maternity leave and her own physical changes and she\u2019s probably carrying quite a bit of the mental load load for preparing for this baby. (I would be happy to be wrong on this but it is also the norm for women to do all the research and make all the lists of items needed and plan ahead). I\u2019m guessing she wants to know your priorities are shifting along with hers.\n\nTalk it out with her. See if any of what I\u2019ve said is accurate to the situation. Maybe not, but I do think there\u2019s more to it.", "You worked hard for that bonus, fair enough. Your wife is pregnant, pregnancy isn't easy what bonus will she get to spend on herself, when the baby comes?\n\nIf she regularly gets to treat herself, that's one thing, but if her 'fun' spending is things like new towels or a rug for the lounge, that's very different.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a small amount. You good.", "She does, but is currently on Stress Leave, so she makes a small amount of the income she used to.", "Its an Amazon card. He cant really put that into a savings account.", "Its an amazon gift card. Can't use it to buy dinner, or a savings account.\n\nCould use it for baby stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo agree though, as a dad I rarely have time for video games. However, upgraded PC parts help if you WFH. Better PC can be relevant since WFH laptops never are that awesome.", "He can do what he wants with his money.", "It's interesting how him spending none of his bonus on himself has morphed into giving his entire yearly bonus to his wife. Where was that said?!", "He didn't say he gave his annual bonus to his wife.  Just that he doesn't spend it on himself.  That could be going to property taxes, joint home expenses etc, savings.  I'm sure he would have said if she spends it all on herself as then everyone would agree he should get to spend the $500 on himself.", "So another issue would be that I have done that in the past. I work a lot of side jobs to save up extra money. Anytime I have done so and saved a bit for my PC upgrade, when it is time to spend it, I\u2019m made to feel bad for spending that money on me instead of putting it into savings or spending it on regular stuff. I think that\u2019s what frustrates me a lot as well.", "I think saying she spends the full yearly bonus at her discretion is a huge leap to make from him not spending it on himself", "I would hope the 5-10k is mostly invested, spent on a mortgage, or used for common stuff.\n\nWould need INFO from OP though as to if the 5-10k bonus each year is spent on anything personal for your wife but never anything personally for you.", "Where does it say she spends his bonus at her discretion?", "\ud83d\udc80", "This goes a long way to explain why she's further stressed over spending the money", "Depends on what their agreement for the division of their income is.

Is your income the only income? Does she spend money on herself and then begrudge you the same thing?", "How much are you gaming?  Maybe that is the real issue and the pushback is because you are always spending money on your PC and you spend hours a day gaming instead of being with your wife?  Not saying this is the case but maybe.  If it is you need to seriously cut down before baby comes or the resentment will be a lot worse.", "\u201cof which I spend none of on myself\u201d. \n\nIt could be spent on joint items or items for the house but none of it is spent on just him.

So like I said, at her discretion.", "She definitely doesn\u2019t spend a whole lot of money on anything and she definitely doesn\u2019t spend all of my bonus on herself. But whenever she wants to order something that maybe we don\u2019t need, I\u2019m supportive because she doesn\u2019t really have many hobbies. All of those little purchases add up quickly. We must receive 2-3 Amazon packages a week of things she\u2019s ordered. But whenever I want to spend a little bit, there\u2019s always lots of pushback. Basically my salary covers all of our bills (mortgage, electricity, car payments, insurances, gas, groceries, etc) and everything she makes is just on top.", "Oh for sure. I understand that 100%. Even so, we really aren\u2019t strapped for cash. I was never questioning why she feels the way she does, just looking for outside opinion on if the way I am thinking is flawed in any way.

You're taking away a lot of his agency here", "If she spend it all on herself, I'm sure OP would have said it that way to get everyone behind OP spending $500 on himself.", "I mean I buy a lot of home cleaning items on Amazon.  I think it's time now to renegiate how you spend on things and how money is distributed.  Time for a join, his and hers so no one can say anything about what you use your agreed upon funds spent on.", "Yeah I think this is where it's wrong.\n\nPushbacks is fine for unneeded stuff. But there are lots of ways upgrading a PC can be more than *nice to have*, and it's just inconsistent when she orders amazon 2-3 times a week and you're fine with it, but you one time want to upgrade your PC at bit and she's instantly against it.\n\nA good way to mend this is to go over finances a bit and see what each person commonly spends on \"nice to haves\".", "Not strapped for cash has a lot of definitions. To me not strapped for cash mean ls $500 is negligible in the long run and you could have gotten the computer part whenever without having to take a second look at the budget. \n\nIn the end I do think you should spend the bonus at your discretion. I'm just not sure hobby that requires a lot of time dedicated to it is the best move for anyone right now. Any computer part you buy is going to be way out of date by the time you have the time to enjoy it. By no means am I saying it has to go on baby stuff... Just ... You know... Think it through. You can only spend it once", "INFO:  When is the baby due?  Are you ready for its arrival?", "this isn't an advice sub, it's a judgement one", "Actually, he didn't ask for advice. He asked if he was an asshole for (rightfully) wanting to spend his bonus on himself.", "I think he means that he doesnt use it exclusively on himself for fun things. It goes to the house or savings or necessities.", "I disagree", "September. I have 8 nieces/nephews and will get a lot of stuff from my siblings to help. We have the room painted and ready, but no furniture as of yet. We are waiting to see what gifts we get from parents etc, before purchasing more stuff. As a side note, we have $4,000 in an emergency account for our cat since he is diabetic/epileptic in case anything happens. So the money itself is definitely not a factor here.", "I think you're okay, you're getting a bigger bonus in June that can go toward the baby.  Talk to your wife and see if you can come to some sort of compromise.  NTA."]}
