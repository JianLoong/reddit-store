She wants to know you\u2019re as excited for the baby as she is. In her mind using this money for baby items may be a way for you to show that as obviously there\u2019s not much else you can do during pregnancy (which frankly sucks).\n2). The gaming system may be making her wonder exactly how much you plan to be gaming when the baby is here. Men ignoring responsibilities is a *huge* problem for a lot of dads and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s you but it also may have crossed her mind.\n3). Back to point #1, her hormones are changing, you\u2019re growing your family, she has to figure out maternity leave and her own physical changes and she\u2019s probably carrying quite a bit of the mental load load for preparing for this baby. (I would be happy to be wrong on this but it is also the norm for women to do all the research and make all the lists of items needed and plan ahead). I\u2019m guessing she wants to know your priorities are shifting along with hers.\n\nTalk it out with her. See if any of what I\u2019ve said is accurate to the situation. Maybe not, but I do think there\u2019s more to it.", "You worked hard for that bonus, fair enough. Your wife is pregnant, pregnancy isn't easy what bonus will she get to spend on herself, when the baby comes?\n\nIf she regularly gets to treat herself, that's one thing, but if her 'fun' spending is things like new towels or a rug for the lounge, that's very different.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a small amount.

Where was that said?!", "He didn't say he gave his annual bonus to his wife.  Just that he doesn't spend it on himself.  That could be going to property taxes, joint home expenses etc, savings.  I'm sure he would have said if she spends it all on herself as then everyone would agree he should get to spend the $500 on himself.", "So another issue would be that I have done that in the past. I work a lot of side jobs to save up extra money.

To me not strapped for cash mean ls $500 is negligible in the long run and you could have gotten the computer part whenever without having to take a second look at the budget. \n\nIn the end I do think you should spend the bonus at your discretion. I'm just not sure hobby that requires a lot of time dedicated to it is the best move for anyone right now.

For $350 or so you can get a 12GB RTX 3060 (new!). These were selling for $1435 - $1445 in August. If you're going to upgrade the GPU to 30-series - it makes sense to do it now while that lower-priced stock is available - because once it's depleted an upgrade like that may be at a significantly higher price point.  Plus - the card isn't likely to be obsolete any time soon. The latest released Nvidia-based GPUs (4090 and 4090 Ti) are running $1600 - $3000+ when in stock.

Your budget will change to accommodate your larger family.\n\nMaybe spec out what would be an excellent upgrade that's less than the $500 and put the rest toward whatever your wife wants.

He gets a yearly bonus of at least $5K that he uses toward the family, so take all the steps back. $500 to spend on himself does not make him a bad dad. \n\nWifey needs to stop being so greedy and manipulative. \n\nBut thank you for the laugh with your idiocy! I really needed a good chuckle.", "YTA", "NTA. Parents need their down time from time to time so buying an upgraded gaming PC is perfect for that. That\u2019s your bonus, not a bonus for you and your new family. It\u2019s fine to spend bonuses on yourself. And this is coming from a single mother who put all of my bonuses towards things for my children. I don\u2019t regret doing it but I don\u2019t believe you should always have to either.", "Hmm when I was pregnant I was all about the baby. Everything ultimately was focused on their well-being and future. My bf (now ex) at the time wasn't even remotely interested in buying baby clothes etc. On reflection I can see how it's probably normal that mom gets attached first and prepares for baby, and world revolves around baby well being as it's inside her body. But at the time it felt like I was alone in the parenting, in that I was putting everything to do with baby above anything else I wanted and he wasn't. It might be worth a conversation about what you buying entertainment stuff means to her in regard to you guys as a family. I'm not saying you shouldn't, but it should be discussed further.", "NTA unscheduled bonuses that are not planned parts of a healthy budget are fun money. You should do exactly what my spouse says when I've gotten them: treat yo self", "NAH; I think you are reasonable, but under circumstances $500 of baby stuff on Amazon is going to be exceptionally more useful.  A small suggestion is keep the gift card in reserve until after the baby is norm and you learn what you actually learn.\n\nCongrats soon to be dad.", "Of course you can spend it on yourself.  Good grief who are these people with their 300 questions and equivocations.  Sigh.", "Is he doing his share of buying baby stuff?  Or is it all on her because she's the mom?  He doesn't need to spend this exact money on the baby but if he's leaving this all for her to buy then that isn't OK.", "It\u2019s a gift card that\u2019s not possible", "I am raising my grandchildren. I still game a fair bit. One is a baby and one is 6. I still have time. I am their sole care giver. I don\u2019t have the luxury of help. If I could afford it, I would get a brand new console. I would encourage any new or not so new parents to buy things like this for themselves occasionally.", "I only had the vague financial information in the OP and a couple other responses when I made my post, but if $500 is nothing to him, why is he even having this argument? \u201cSure honey, you\u2019re right. Let\u2019s use this to get baby stuff.\u201d *picks out stuff with wife, then goes and spends money in checking account on computer.*\n\nEither the $500 is a big deal, in which case carefully considering how it\u2019s spent is reasonable, or the $500 is not a big deal, in which case OP can simply \u201cyes dear\u201d it away and do what he wants, and everyone\u2019s happy.", "I mean, we have 2 less then 2 years apart. My husband uses his free time on his other hobbies, it's not like he doesn't do anything for himself. He also works more then 40 hours a week and helps with the kids..\n\nI work from home and have our kids here with me. He gets more time then I do. \n\nI think it's okay that you'd make a different decision. It's not a decision I would support though.", "Both of the grandchildren watch me game. I didn\u2019t think the baby would but he does. I absolutely stop when either one needs anything. I don\u2019t put the baby on the floor if I will be playing so that I won\u2019t be distracted and keep him out of things. I thought it would be much harder than it is. I used to be very disapproving of people who still played after having kids because I didn\u2019t realize it can easily be done. I definitely can\u2019t play as much as I could without any children to take care of but I easily get in 10 hours a week which to me makes it worth having an upgraded gaming system.", "NTA and you also now know to keep these small windfalls to yourself.", "NTA, it's important to be able to treat yourself once in a while and this is small potatos!", "It\u2019s just an AH move to get any kind of bonus or windfall and not see it as 50/50 belonging to you and your spouse. If you could really use the upgrade and she isn\u2019t in need of anything, she WBTA for not agreeing to buy your hobby thing. But you are certainly TA for just deciding to spend every dime on yourself without even consulting her.", "I really want to say NTA but it seems to me the she is not as comfortable with your financial situation as you are.\n\n  If you give her the card and wait til June to spend 10% of the bonus would that cause an issue? Can you wait?", "NTA, you earned that money and if you are not broke and can afford your baby expenses I see no problem here.", "Go look up the difference between tax withholding and actual tax liability.", "You can't use an Amazon gift card to buy gift cards as far as I know. Unless that has changed since I left working there in Jan.", "Can confirm. I got a sign on bonus at a job and forgot about it by the time I filed taxes the second year and my return was a lot lower compared to the first year. I was so miffed! And then I realized what it was. Haha. First world problem.", "It doesn't help that they're always changing the withholding schedules, so even if you don't get a bonus, it's hard to estimate what your refund is going to be for any given year.  You just get surprised when you file your return.", "I get that you have thought through generally how financially prepared you are for a kid, but have you both sat down and made a new budget? And if you've done it by yourself, does she know about it?\n\nDoes she have any siblings with kids?", "NAH. $500 isn\u2019t a lot realistically (especially given you\u2019re receiving a 5k-10k bonus in the summer), and there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to treat yourself. You have worked hard and even though you\u2019ve got a growing family, it\u2019s still important to find time for your own individuality. \n\nThat said, your wife just found out she\u2019s pregnant. That means her body isn\u2019t just hers anymore. She\u2019s sacrificing the most basic autonomy humans have, and will be doing so for the next 9 months. Everything you worry about doing she will too, in addition to doing the actually growing of the baby. From her perspective she\u2019s looking at this long journey of sacrifice after sacrifice, where every choice she makes will be scrutinized by everyone. Then she hears you got a bonus the first thing you did was think about yourself, and not your family. \n\nBoth viewpoints are understandable. Talk to each other about your expectations for the next 9 months, budgeting for baby things, and acknowledge your wife\u2019s sacrifices she\u2019s making. Remember, you\u2019re a team, so look at this together. Also, as others have pointed out, gaming can become problematic. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s read stories of husbands who do hardly anything with the baby but still have time to game nightly. She very well may be concerned about that too. Talk about how you both are going to handle parenting duties and ensure neither of you feels under appreciated.", "NTA if she doesn't work, she needs to start immediately.  She seems clueless about how a small bonus can be used to buy something tht will help you decompress after a difficult day at work.  She needs to let you use this little bonus for you and you can spend the larger one on the baby.", " Thanks for your input!"]}
