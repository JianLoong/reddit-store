{"id": 22145, "submission_id": "14ytp78", "title": "AITA for taking my stuff without telling my roommates?", "selftext": "\n\nSo I lived with my 2 friends for a year in a apartment. They are both a couple. This year I moved out because a family member of mine is in and out of the hospital. I gave them about a 2 months notice about me moving out. None of them had a job for a few months and me being the only one having a job. One day I went with my father and brother to pick up my big things Washer and Dryer, air conditioner and a few other things. They weren't home at the time. I paid rent for the month and I told them I was gonna pick up my stuff.\n\n After that they ghosted me for a few days. About a week goes by and I went over to get the rest of my stuff including my cat that was still there. They meant me out by the door and told me that they were frustrated with me. They explained that they thought I would leave my stuff there for a few more months for them to use since they didn't have money to replace my stuff that was out in the living for general use. I did them I would leave the washer and dryer but decided to take it because I didn't like the downstairs neighbors using it. My friend tried blocking the door from me getting in so I kinda had to push her out of the way to get in. Then they went on to say when they got home after me taking my stuff that my friend collapsed on the couch and started to cry because I took my things. \n\nThey told me that they would expect this from a slob but not me since i was better off than they were. I did leave them a few things to keep including a couch, chair, and a kitchen island. They explained that they now need to get jobs and save money for the things I took that were mine.Then they told me they needed a break from me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit The only reason why my cat was there for a week was because they wouldn't answer my texts or calls and I did go over there a few times to get her but they locked me out of the apartment. I had to surprise visit them to get into the apartment. They also agreed to keep her there because my parents didn't want her at house at first but I did buy cat litter and food for her. Yes I did get her back when I did the surprise visit.Sorry I didn't make that clear.", "created_utc": 1689275782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ytp78/aita_for_taking_my_stuff_without_telling_my/", "score": 284, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't understand your priorities *at all.* You had apparently told them you would leave the washer and dryer for a few months, but took them without notice, which you had to know would piss them off, and then left your innocent cat behind so, what, they could take out their frustration on it??\n\nLook, it's not grand that you changed your mind, went back on your word, and came to take your stuff without mentioning it to them, but YTA for prioritizing appliances over your cat. If your parents didn't want your cat, then perhaps not pissing off the roommates who were going to have to take care of it for you would have been a wise move. \n\nIf you can't be bothered to care for an animal, don't get a pet.", "They agreed to watch her.

They can sit on the floor in the puddle of guilt they tried to lay on you.", "Nta you see they aren\u2019t good people right? Why are they blaming you that they have to get jobs, that\u2019s life. Trash took itself out", "INFO: am I getting this right? Hard time reading it. You told them you'd let them keep the washer and dryer for a few months, then decided to take it anyway without telling them?\n\nIf so it's a E S H for me. They're freeloaders, but it's still shitty to go back on your word about something that impacts people so massively.", "NTA \ud83d\ude02 this is funny.", "They are not your friends, I'm sorry to tell you.

You paid amounts rent while not living there; you're NTA.", "NTA. \"They explained that they thought I would leave my stuff there for a few more months for them to use since they didn't have money to replace my stuff that was out in the living for general use.\" Tough shit for them.

Their inability (or refusal) to work and lack of home appliances isn\u2019t YOUR PROBLEM. NTA. Sorry OP. Roommates can really suck sometimes.", "Nta - whoa holy shit these people are literally children. \u201cWah I have to get a job\u201d uhh yeah??", "NTA. Go back to get the rest of your stuff NOW. Who knows what they might do to it", "NTA Consider yourself lucky you got your stuff back. They probably would not have gotten it to you in those \"few more months\". Probably would swear it was abandoned property. They had 2 months notice and longer than that to actually get jobs.", "NTA.  Also they're not your friends.", "Not the asshole.  Too bad your ex-roomies now have to be adults and get jobs to pay for things.  Adulting is hard, and they'll either figure it out or they'll be out of the apartment soon and living back with mom and dad.  You gave notice, more notice, and even gave more rent money.  I would've taken everything that belonged to me, even if it left the apartment bare.  People have no appreciation.  These assholes showed you that by locking you out of the house after you moved out to help a family member, while keeping your cat.  Stay away from these people as they've shown you their true colors and that you aren't their friend, just their financial support system.  Fuck em.", "NTA. They are emotionally manipulating you. You\u2019re not a slob. They\u2019re being entitled brats.", "No that there problems. You had a sick family to worries about.", "NTA. Take everything with you, these \"friends\" will mooch off whoever they can for however long they can. Boo hoo, cry me a river, they can get a fuckin job.", "Totally NTA. \n\nI was in the opposite side. I told my roommate that I wasn\u2019t going to renew the lease. I didn\u2019t tell him the reason was he was always behind on paying me since I paid all the bills and rent. I went on a week long business trip to him gone. Granted my roommate took some of glasses/dishes. But what ever. \n\nI continued to live there 6 more years.", "NTA and you should have taken all of it after the conversation.", "NTA\nYou paid for it.

Do yourself a favor drop those wackos.", "NTA when they blocked the door you should've taken everything", "So you paid rent for the month and they thought they had right to lock you out?  That makes them the AHs right there\n\nSo they expected you to pay for their needs because you are better off than they are?  They are AH's\n\nSo they kept you from retrieving your cat (a living being)?  They are the AHs\n\nThe only possible you suck here would be that you agreed to leave washer/dryer there and then took it early.  Were they letting neighbor use them without your permission?  If so--they are AH's and your possible suck gets retracted.\n\nBoo-hoo, they have to get jobs and act like adults.  Yeah no sympathy for them\n\nNTA", "I keep seeing that meme with Loki. \n\nOh No. So Sad.  Anyways. \n\nNTA all the way, and OP should go back and take the rest of their stuff", "I was crying reading this\u2026.. boo boo, get a f-n job!", "those were parasites, not friends.", "OP, these aren't 'friends'.\n\nNTA in the least, and you should do well to make sure that 'distance' they want stays permanent.", "Holy shit-\nMomma should cut the cord", "Yay!"]}
