They are both a couple. This year I moved out because a family member of mine is in and out of the hospital. I gave them about a 2 months notice about me moving out. None of them had a job for a few months and me being the only one having a job. One day I went with my father and brother to pick up my big things Washer and Dryer, air conditioner and a few other things. They weren't home at the time. I paid rent for the month and I told them I was gonna pick up my stuff.\n\n After that they ghosted me for a few days. About a week goes by and I went over to get the rest of my stuff including my cat that was still there. They meant me out by the door and told me that they were frustrated with me. They explained that they thought I would leave my stuff there for a few more months for them to use since they didn't have money to replace my stuff that was out in the living for general use. I did them I would leave the washer and dryer but decided to take it because I didn't like the downstairs neighbors using it. My friend tried blocking the door from me getting in so I kinda had to push her out of the way to get in. Then they went on to say when they got home after me taking my stuff that my friend collapsed on the couch and started to cry because I took my things. \n\nThey told me that they would expect this from a slob but not me since i was better off than they were. I did leave them a few things to keep including a couch, chair, and a kitchen island. They explained that they now need to get jobs and save money for the things I took that were mine.Then they told me they needed a break from me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit The only reason why my cat was there for a week was because they wouldn't answer my texts or calls and I did go over there a few times to get her but they locked me out of the apartment. I had to surprise visit them to get into the apartment. They also agreed to keep her there because my parents didn't want her at house at first but I did buy cat litter and food for her.
