It does not have the same rights as a service dog. Its only job is literally to exist in the close vicinity of the owner. It is not task trained to mitigate any disabilities like a service dog. By petting the emotional support dog, you were in no way interfering with its job, which is to just exist nearby. Simply put, an emotional service dog is just a pet that the owner can keep with them in housing that typically doesn't allow pets. That's it.\n\n2 If she didn't want someone to touch her dog, she should have added do not pet patches to their collar, harness, or leash. She also should have trained her dog on not wandering off.\n\nBefore you downvote me for saying she should have added do not pet labels, let me explain. Those labels aren't misleading the public to believe the dog is a service dog because there are many reasons why an owner would not want strangers to pet the dog. For example, they could be overly friendly to the point where it ruins the training being worked on, they're aggressive, or the owner simply doesn't like random people petting.\n\nMy own dog would get so excited when pet by strangers to the point where she lost bladder control on them. Hence, my own do not pet labels. This allowed us to work on teaching her calmness around strangers and to stop random friendly people from being peed on.\n\nWhere I would absolutely draw the line is if someone were to buy service dog labels and stick them on their emotional support dog.
