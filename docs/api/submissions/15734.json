I apologized and kept my hands to myself. She would not let it go though and she continued to chastise me for having pet her dog like that. I was confused and I asked her what she meant. She told me that what I did was incredibly improper and rude. I apologized again but she wouldn't stop.\n\nShe went into a complete tirade telling me that everyone knows you shouldn't pet peoples emotional support dogs and I was being a selfish asshole. This woman worked herself up so much that she started crying and told me that I wasn't treating her like a human being.
