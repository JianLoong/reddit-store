It does not have the same rights as a service dog. Its only job is literally to exist in the close vicinity of the owner. It is not task trained to mitigate any disabilities like a service dog.

Simply put, an emotional service dog is just a pet that the owner can keep with them in housing that typically doesn't allow pets.

She also should have trained her dog on not wandering off.\n\nBefore you downvote me for saying she should have added do not pet labels, let me explain. Those labels aren't misleading the public to believe the dog is a service dog because there are many reasons why an owner would not want strangers to pet the dog. For example, they could be overly friendly to the point where it ruins the training being worked on, they're aggressive, or the owner simply doesn't like random people petting.\n\nMy own dog would get so excited when pet by strangers to the point where she lost bladder control on them. Hence, my own do not pet labels. This allowed us to work on teaching her calmness around strangers and to stop random friendly people from being peed on.\n\nWhere I would absolutely draw the line is if someone were to buy service dog labels and stick them on their emotional support dog.

I've also never seen a service animal with your average leash-it's always something that appears more specialized.", "I have a service dog and don\u2019t vest him when temperatures are hot (because he\u2019s a double coated breed) and also when I am traveling in potentially sketchy places like downtown San Francisco, where I live.  \n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s super popular to steal service dogs and I don\u2019t want to telegraph we are vulnerable. \n\nI call ahead to businesses to let them know I\u2019m with a service dog. Also I don\u2019t vest him at work because I don\u2019t want to make that the most prominent part about us, we maintain our training and boundaries by just asking my coworkers to not need him or solicit attention without prior permission, and under supervised conditions only.", "Once again, it is not a requirement to have a vest on your service dog. People are allowed to bring their service dogs anywhere without any visual indicator on the dog that it is a service dog.\n\nLots of people put a vest on their dog for the hope of avoiding people randomly petting or distracting their dog, but people should not be petting dogs without permission from an owner in general whether or not there is a vest.\n\nIf you want to pet a dog you ask. It's simple lol", "No. Know why? Because people can buy those vests online for anything. They throw them on their dogs because they want to claim them as service dogs when they aren't. People actually don't need to know if your dog is a service dog or not. If you work for a business and someone comes in with a dog, you ask them \"is this a service dog. What service does it perform?\" If you are just shopping or anything else, don't approach random dogs and trained service dogs won't approach you so it really doesn't matter.", "I think I read somewhere that if an actual service dog approaches you, their owner is in trouble and you should go looking for them\u2026", "Funny story. Not all service dogs are smart. I had a friend in college with a seeing eye dog that was SUPER bad at his job. More than once he got derailed from walking her to class by the campus squirrels. Before we became friends I was sitting on a stoop and literally just made eye contact with the dog and he comes trotting over with her in tow. I was so nervous I did something wrong! But she was cool and just said that he's kinda dumb. Kept her safe and all that, but not super professional as far as dogs with jobs go. Lol", "Actually we call my dog an anti-emotional support dog.  If you are crying or upset, he will go seek literally anyone else to get comfort from them as opposed to give comfort to you.  Super sweet most of the time \u2014 just won\u2019t provide emotional support", "\ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf88", "It\u2019s also respectful to not let your dog greet people without their permission.

Well trained dogs don\u2019t greet strangers unless the owner lets them. \n\nOnce a dog starts greeting me, I\u2019m going to take action to assure it that I\u2019m friendly since the dog\u2019s owner clearly isn\u2019t interested in it\u2019s behaviour.", "Yep, I'm a vet and have almost been bitten multiple times by dogs that the owners let approach me without restraint. Then when it snaps they giggle and say, \"oh yeah, Fluffy doesn't like strangers/likes to nip!\" I never touch a strange dog anymore.", "OP put her hand out for the dog to sniff. That's usually how you check if it's safe. So she DID check first.", "In this case, by the owner, lol", "Most airlines don\u2019t accept ESAs anymore for exactly this reason. Too many people took advantage of it. Now, they only accept service dogs in the cabin.

Enough said.", "\"The dog came up and sniffed my leg.\"\n\nSounds like the dog approached them. If you don't want strangers to pet your dog, control your dog. When I take my dogs out, I don't let them approach strangers.", "If someone brings a dog that bites out into public and lets them approach people, that person would absolutely be an A without question.", "If your dog is so unfriendly that they would bite someone in public you have an obligation to not let them walk up to strangers.", "Well if you\u2019re not paying much attention to your dog then don\u2019t throw a tantrum if it does something you don\u2019t approve of. Not to mention the dog clearly wasn\u2019t properly trained to behave however the lady wants it to.", "My roommate has a service dog and we spend a lot of time together, so I'm pretty familiar with how service dogs work.\n\nI know that the vest isn't a requirement, but the reality is that if you don't have your dog in a vest people are going to treat them like a random dog. It's quite irrational to expect people to magically know service dog etiquette for a random fucking animal that is dressed as and behaving like a pet", "I know that people can buy those vests online. I know that service dogs have legal access.\n\nMy point is one of communication and expectation. If you don't communicate that your dog is a service animal, people can't be expected to magically know that it is a service animal.", "Basically one of the only/few reasons trained service animals approach strangers- something is wrong- you should seek help or follow the dog to the situation then seek help. Trained animals are focused on their task and working while they are in public, not focused on getting attention. There is usually very specific training to make places like the dogs park specifically different and meant for them to behave silly and be dog- ultimately they know the difference between what they do at a dog park and what they do at a grocery store or doctors office etc.", "Yes but the dog seeking you out and the owner being missing is usually a pretty clear sign instead of a dog approaching you with their owner two feet away completely fine", "Typical employee! Acts great to GET the job, then slacks after when \u201chired\u201d, smh! J/k, that was a cute story and I hope shes doing well.", "Lol, I had a colleague with a similar dog.

You should ask owner and observe body language.", "Yes, and the reason is because \"somebody signed a paper.\"\n\nESAs are pets that have a doctor's note, nothing more.", "What a nothing comment.  An esa is a pet in Public.", "You can buy a vest for an ESA off Amazon. \n\nAnd, you can't ask for the certification because they're \"protected.\" \n\nYes, they are pets. Also dogs, with or without training, are alert to conditions. So are all dogs ESAs now? I didn't think so.", "No, it's a pet, they don't have special rights in the USA, they only can go where normal pets are allowed not where service dogs are allowed", "OP can't even control themselves and we want someone who is codependent with their dog to control the dog?\n\nIt's an ESH situation. The dog owner is responsible for their dog, yes, however a grown adult should know to *ask* before petting another person's pet. Even if the pet appears friendly and approaches them. For all anyone knows the pet could have some allergy, or illness. You never know.", "Yes because everyone online is 100% truthful 100% of the time and humans are not wired to avoid being socially ostracized. I don't get into someone else's car because the door was unlocked and say \"well, you should have locked your door. If you didn't want people climbing into your car you'd lock the door. I'm not the asshole here you are for getting mad at me!\" Same thing with dogs. I don't care if a dog approaches me. I'm never petting it without permission. Don't touch other people's property without permission.", "Yea, I worded that comment poorly\n\nDon\u2019t give a damn about ESAs. I know how much work goes into service and therapy work, being a handler myself. \n\nStill, if OP had asked permission that lady may not have had a meltdown. \n\nWas it proper behavior for the dog to approach? \n\nNope, not at all. But this entire thing could have been avoided had they taken an extra 2 seconds to ask for permission. Doesn\u2019t matter if there was a vest or not.", "yes they are but there\u2019s no harm in putting in preventative measures. it\u2019s not a genius idea to not touch other peoples animals without asking.", "It's not magical service dog etiquette to ask to pet a dog. This is basic \"interacting with any dog I don't know\" etiquette and general common sense. It takes essentially no effort to go \"wow, your dog is so sweet! can I give him a pet?\". I'm not even saying the other woman is reasonable or in the right either, only that the fact that trying to tie validating OP to the fact that no vest was worn is not relevant in the slightest.\n\nPeople should ALSO not treat random dogs like a free for all when it comes to petting. There are people who take reactive dogs out, unmuzzled, every day. I've known multiple reactive dogs who will gladly approach people and then flip when their interaction is reciprocated. It's not just polite to ask, it's basic safety common sense.", "Yes, that\u2019s what I meant\u2026", "When I was in college, a few students had service dogs.
