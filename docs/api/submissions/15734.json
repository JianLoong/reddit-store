Service dogs and emotional support pets aren\u2019t required to have an identifying vest.

Those labels aren't misleading the public to believe the dog is a service dog because there are many reasons why an owner would not want strangers to pet the dog. For example, they could be overly friendly to the point where it ruins the training being worked on, they're aggressive, or the owner simply doesn't like random people petting.\n\nMy own dog would get so excited when pet by strangers to the point where she lost bladder control on them. Hence, my own do not pet labels. This allowed us to work on teaching her calmness around strangers and to stop random friendly people from being peed on.\n\nWhere I would absolutely draw the line is if someone were to buy service dog labels and stick them on their emotional support dog. That is very illegal, and the poor behaviours of those ESA causes misconceptions about actual service dogs and create access issues for the disabled.\n\nAlthough I feel you were wrong for petting a dog that didn't belong to you and without permission, this is am I the asshole.

Idc who you are, if you touch my dog without asking permission, I\u2019m gonna correct you. \nFfs, this made me angry. \nEsh cause she wouldn\u2019t let it go but what op did was inherently wrong as well.", "Emotional support goose perhaps? Then it can honk at people to back tf up?", "Yes. For everyone out there, an ESA is a PET. That is legally (effectively) all they are. The ONLY luxuries having an ESA allows you is having them in no-pet housing and being able to fly with them on SOME airlines, and you need extensive paperwork. Outside of those two very specific and limited instances, they\u2019re no different than any other dog out there. They can be forbidden from public spaces and do not have any other \u2018protections\u2019. They aren\u2019t \u2018working\u2019 and thus the whole \u201cdo not pet a working dog\u201d doesn\u2019t apply. It is a crime to claim an ESA is a service animal, by the way. Two very different legal definitions. \n\nNow, you should always use caution when petting a dog you don\u2019t know, as you don\u2019t know if the dog will bite, but at that point, that\u2019s FULLY the fault of the owner for not restraining their *pet* in public.", "Yeah I got real 'persecution fetish' vibes from this entitled AH.", "Sounds like the owner needs more than an emotional support dog. Serious therapy. The dog approached OP. She didn't run up and pet the dog. Never pet a dog with a vest on that states he's a medical alert dog, seeing eye dog. Anyone can have an emotional support dog", "Yeah, if the owner doesnt want people to pet her dog, she should keep it away from others. That dog was looking for pets. Also, an Emotional support dog isnt the same as a service dogs. Service dogs have specialized training, are working, and need to focus on their task so petting THEM is wrong. But an ESA, unless im mistaken, is just a pet the person needs to help, well, support their emotions and no specialized training is needed.", "Yeah there's also zero rules about not petting emotional support animals, it's just service animals you're not supposed to pet. It sounds like she was looking for trouble.", "I bet the dog isnt even a proper emotional support animal. I'd guess also that it wasn't even wearing anything indicating it was an ESA like a harness or a vest. So OP would have been completely unaware that the dog couldn't be petted. Just think this lady wanted attention.", "the ESA debate is the worst sort of thing to wade into, but I'll do it, I guess. no, ESAs don't perform a specific medical service, but there is plenty of evidence that links having a pet to better mental and physical health. which is why, I assume, ESAs are a thing in the first place - good to live with a pet, but you don't need to be able to take it everywhere.", "Yup. My husband has PTSD and had our dog registered for that. Brings the risk of public meltdown WAY down.", "Yeah this. Not wanting other people to pet your animal is one thing, and yeah it's polite to ask the owner first, but treating them as actual service animals when they are just ESAs is out of line. It certainly does not make you an \"asshole\" for petting an obviously friendly dog that wanted pets. That's a bit far. Of course this is just my opinion.\n\nShould they have asked the owner? Yeah, but dog language will automatically tell you whether they want you to pet them or not. If the owner wants to be a asshole about people petting their dog, that's okay I guess. It's your dog. But, hiking up the importance of the \"service\" your dog performs is just ridiculous and a strange ego trip. If you're dog can't be pet while working, it should wear a vest.\n\nI say this as an owner of two ESA dogs. It's just so that I'm not denied housing, that's all. I just need to keep my dogs because my mental state would deteriorate without them. They don't perform a service, they don't \"work\" every time we are out walking. They are pets that help with my emotions. That's it.", "It\u2019s why I wish that there was better identification and registration requirements for these animals.\n\nOnly where service dog vests if it is professionally trained and certified.\n\nMany \u201cemotional support\u201d animals have bitten people on planes. Service animals won\u2019t.", "At my old retail job, a lady came in with her son that had a service dog in training. He had a vest on so I knew not to touch him and the mom told me he was a service dog, but not fully trained. \n\nThe item they wanted was on the bottom shelf, so when I crouched down, the dog thought I was coming to see him and jumped in my lap to give me kisses. I gave him a quick hug and a pat before the owner pulled him away and we all laughed about it and moved on.  \n\nThis lady sounds like she just wants drama/attention.", "Some doesn't equal everyone and yeah some are def upset I said don't pet dogs without permission. You don't have to agree with that assessment of course.", "Because dog lovers are gd annoying sometimes lol. \"The dog came up to op/me!\" Ok?? And yeah pretty much all that but you know dogs are soooo hard to resist. Which I mean I do get. Hell I saw my breed of choice(rare for where I am in the US) the other day being walked and had to stop myself from being that person because it was clear the owner was focused on getting the walk done. Did it suck? sure. Did I live? Yup.", ">Isn't every dog kind of an emotional support dog?\n\nThere's a joke/meme going around facebook on this.  Something like \"all dogs are support dogs, some are just civilians.\"  (Or something like that).", "Dogs aren't allowed in as many places in the US as they are in Germany, but if it's am emotional support animal then they are allowed. My former step mother has her dog registered as one which she fully admits she did just so she can bring her dog places she otherwise couldn't go.\n\nTo be fair, ESAs do have a legit use for some ppl with anxiety or whatnot but it's very easily abused because we have dumb laws in the US. Then again we generally don't train dogs in the US to German standards. Source: American living in Germany.", "That's the worst part. OP didn't approach the pet, it approached her. Poor dog will need a support dog after owners hissy fits", "Pretentious. That's exactly it, spot on, mate.", "An ESA is just a pet and some doctors will say you need a pet.", "The poor dog needs a dog!", "That's really sad honestly and she realistically should get her license revoked potentially. Giving out ESAs like that are unethical and against the law ...", "Why are you so upset and angry that I criticized you for calling people upset and angry?", "It's not some hardship to keep your dog next to you if you don't want someone to pet them.  If a friendly dog comes into your space, it can be hard not to touch them even if you're trying to avoid it.", "Yeah it's a stretch to believe she's retained any of those with her histrionics", "This type doesn't have friends, but they do often have a circle of like-minded crabs.", "Lord same here! (Not the seizures part) I got my dog for some support with anxieties and depression. After adopting him he is just scared of everything above the sun and has terrible allergies so he's on a special diet and receives allergy shots. But I still love him, I like to think Im his emotional support human", "Absolutely.  It\u2019s completely rude to let your dog approach others!", "There\u2019s an emotional support dog on my ferry in the mornings. Wears a vest, clearly marked, owner is fine with people petting him.", "This exactly. NTA", "My old dog flunked out of service training. He knew enough that when my roommate had seizures he would do some stuff (head on her chest to regulate breathing, licking her face to wake her, ect...) \nOne day she seized and he went to help her, or so I thought...he actually was just stealing the sandwich still clutched in her hand! I think I know why he flunked out...", "And while I think it\u2019s generally polite and safest to ask before petting someone\u2019s dog, if the dog is making clearly friendly advances, sometimes that rule gets bypassed before the dogs turns herself inside out for some lovin\u2019.", "Exactly. You shouldn\u2019t pet a service animal. An emotional support animal is different. If the dog approaches you, like this dog did to OP, they\u2019re obviously not trained to be \u201con the job\u201d while out in public and they\u2019re fair game to pet when they encroach on your space. Sounds like something else was going on with the lady, perhaps whatever that something is was the reason she has the emotional support dog, but still no reason to go off on OP because her untrained dog approached a stranger and that stranger was friendly.", "Exactly", "I think anyone with a genuine ESA, like yours, would be happy to let their animals interact with other people, because it generally leads to positive interactions with people."]}
