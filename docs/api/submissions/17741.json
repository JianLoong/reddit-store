I would understand if her package had gone missing after you put it in the lobby but considering it had *your* address on it with a different name, I am not sure why she would expect you to knock on every door until you found the right person. \n\nIf your lobby is unmanned and unsecured then I would say you should have kept a hold of it until someone came to collect it, just to ensure it wasn't stolen. However, it isn't really your responsibility and she should write the address correctly next time.", "NTA but I wonder if she sent it to you intentionally as a way to meet you and then got upset because her plan didn't work out.\n\nYou definitely did the right thing returning the package.
