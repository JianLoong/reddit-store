YOU DIDNT KNOW THEM. And for the love of god, being friendly to a stranger on an elevator making small talk or its a nice day does NOT mean you know their name or what apt they live in in a complex. The people in the lobby would know the names and apts of the people there though. \n\nAnd what else were you supposed to do? You work long hours and get home late. What if you had brought it inside and the person seeking it kept missing you at home for a couple days? Then dear god you would have been accused of 'stealing' it. Ignore rude people so filled with their self importance that they assume the whole world knows them and where they live and what they want.", "NTA, sounds like maybe she was having a bad day or something", "NTA.  You have a very strange neighbor.  Avoid her.", "NTA.  That neighbor sounds a bit off.  I'd steer clear of her and not worry about her weird comments.  You did the right thing in returning the package to the lobby and that's the end of it, or at least should be the end of your responsibility for a misdelivered package.", "NTA. But... Since she said you should've opened it, I might lean towards it was not a mistake, but inside was maybe a bouquet of flowers with an invitation to come over. After all, I **am** a dork and this is how a girl would try to flirt with me and I'd just ignore the hints.", "NTA, you did the right thing.  Just because someone tells you the expect you do do something, it doesn't oblige you to do that.  She got her package so what's the problem ... bizarre reaction to a non-event.", "Definitely NTA-you did the right thing. The woman thinks that you knew who she was. She\u2019s wrong to assume anything and delivering it back to the lobby or main office of the complex is perfectly fine to do regardless. She could have not been home, you could have not known which unit, and 10 other possibilities could be affecting this. I\u2019m sorry this woman is hung up on this and making you uncomfortable.\n\nIf you want a potentially petty reply, the next time she says something to you, yell at her to \u201cstay home 24/7 when she\u2019s expecting a package then!\u201d", "Well, I mean, how dare you not personally deliver it. By sending it back to the doorman, your neighbor now had to make the simply unbearable trip all the way to the lobby! So inconsiderate.\n\nThat\u2019s a joke\u2026..\n\nAnd you are NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s an ingrate.", "NTA somethin ain\u2019t right with that girl", "Based on these facts, NTA.\n\nSure you could have went to their apartment directly to return it but there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with bringing it to the front desk. Definitely not a move worthy of sarcasm and name calling.", "NTA\n\nFirstly, never open someone else's mail like she suggested - that's illegal. Or at least it is in the UK. \n\nShe seems like a weirdo tbh. I would understand if her package had gone missing after you put it in the lobby but considering it had *your* address on it with a different name, I am not sure why she would expect you to knock on every door until you found the right person. \n\nIf your lobby is unmanned and unsecured then I would say you should have kept a hold of it until someone came to collect it, just to ensure it wasn't stolen. However, it isn't really your responsibility and she should write the address correctly next time.", "NTA but I wonder if she sent it to you intentionally as a way to meet you and then got upset because her plan didn't work out.\n\nYou definitely did the right thing returning the package.  Also, how did she know you had her package in the first place?", "We\u2019re you able to deliver it directly to her? If so, that would\u2019ve been nice, but not necessary. It\u2019s not your responsibility. She got her package so she should be satisfied. Sounds like this is her problem, not yours. NTA.", "NTA. You did your part by dropping the package off at the post office. It's not your fault that the recipient didn't pick it up. You tried to contact them, but they didn't respond. You did everything you could.\r  \n\r  \nIt's possible that the recipient didn't get your messages. Or maybe they did get them, but they just didn't care. Either way, it's not your problem. You're not obligated to go out of your way to hand-deliver a package to someone who doesn't seem to want it.\r  \n\r  \nThe post office is a perfectly acceptable way to return a package. In fact, it's probably the best way to do it. That way, you know that the package will eventually get to its destination.\r  \n\r  \nSo don't feel bad about not personally giving back the package. You did everything you could.", "INFO: is there a doorman or anything who was going to redirect the package, or did you just put it on the floor in a mail room?", "Did you even recognise the name on the package?", "NTA and your not obligated to talk to her based off recent interaction. I'd ignore her from now on and go about my days. That was an unnecessary interaction for a neighborly thing you did.", "Why would you have opened it? That's literally a crime. What a weird thing to say", "From the \"She told me I was more friendly on the elevator rides\", it seems like she may have been hoping you two were going to be friends, and that you would have recognized her name on the package and given it to her as a friendly / social gesture? So she was disappointed you didn't.\n\nShe might just be lonely being in a new place. (And if queer, may have been trying to flirt).", "NTA, while it may have been nice to get it to her directly, it's not your job. She should have put her address in correctly lol", "You didn't have her address, just her name. Did she expect you to knock on every door until you found someone claiming to be the correct person?

Even the package address mix up could have been planned. She wanted to see what you'd do with an excuse to knock on her door. Her joking about thinking you'd be more friendly = she wanted you to be more friendly.", "Was this an elaborate set up? She purposely used your apartment number to make you come talk to her?

Sneaky & not to underestimated.", "NTA. It would be one thing if the package had the right address but was delivered to you by mistake. In that case, you would know exactly where it should go and could bring it to the right person. But with just a name?

You did exactly the right thing and why she thinks that you should have started knocking on doors just to hand deliver the package is more than weird. It is also very entitled.

YOU DIDNT KNOW THEM.\n\nWith the disclaimer that leaving the package in the lobby was perfectly reasonable (and probably what I would have done as well), and OP is NTA at all, figuring out which apartment the neighbor lives in wouldn't have been some sort of grail quest. The delivery address will usually include the apartment number, and even if it didn't, most buildings have a directory by the intercom or mailboxes, so she could have found the neighbor's apartment there.", "How would she even know OP received her package unless she purposefully put OP's address, in which case why???", "I would love to know what was in the box, with the comment about OP opening it. I definitely got a flirty vibe there \n\nSex toys? Lingerie? Gwyneth Paltrow's head?", "OP's address was on the box.

It seems like she sent it to OP herself.  I wonder if there was a return address.", "Kinda what I was thinking. Maybe she sent it to her address on purpose hoping she would return it and then there is small talk, a coffee date and next thing you know grandma is telling her grandkids the cute story of how she met grandma over a lost package.
