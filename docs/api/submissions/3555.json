My mother (43) was unsure if she wanted children, but still made the choice to have me. She and my father were never married and separated when she was pregnant with me. I never permanently lived with her - I was living with my great aunt and grandmother until I was 19, when I moved into an apartment by myself.\n\nMy mother started dating someone who was a severe alcoholic and became an alcoholic herself. She would occasionally drop by to visit me and my grandmother or great aunt, sometimes while shit-faced drunk. One night when I was 15 and she was drunk, she called me and told me I was an accident she shouldn't have had. I cut contact with her and my great aunt (who I was living with at the time) didn't allow my mother to visit.\n\nI didn't talk to her until a week ago, when she contacted me and told me to call her. She said she wanted to make amends for things she had done in her past, so I called her. She told me she was sorry for being such a shitty mother and she should have been there for me instead of drinking. She broke down crying after I reminded her she told me I was an accident when I was still technically a child. She told me to have some mercy on her since she was young and stupid and that she wouldn't be able to forgive herself if I didn't accept her apology.\n\nI didn't know what to say and without thinking, I told her she was an immature and selfish person. I told her if she was truly sorry, she should have asked to talk in person instead of calling. She proceeded to tell me that she wouldn't have been able to properly apologize in person as she would have cried the whole time, but I told her to quit making excuses for her behavior. I told her I wouldn't accept any apologies of hers unless she apologized in person. She told me that if I was going to be so immature about an apology, then maybe I didn't deserve one. She then hung up.\n\nI felt guilty and tried calling her the next day, but she denied the call and sent a text telling me I was the immature and selfish one, not her.

INCLUDING that she had been behaving in an immature and selfish manner, BECAUSE SHE HAD, and it harmed you, her kid. \n\nHere's the thing: you're NTA because you didn't say those things just for the sake of being hateful, you said them because they were true. She behaved immaturely and selfishly and it genuinely hurt you. And you were letting her know that in a way that was true and heartfelt. That absolutely doesn't make you an AH. But if she wasn't ready to hear it, and prepared to really hear about the pain she had caused in order to move forward in an honest way? Then she isn't as sorry as maybe she thinks she is . .. she's just feeling guilty. \n\nI'm really sorry, sweetheart. I'm a little older than your mom and I desperately wanted kids and never had any. I wish I could hug you. You deserved better than you got. I hope that you still get that as an adult. Either way, you're NTA.", "NTA.

She's playing crocodile tears for whatever reason, but being sorry isn't one of them. And she's using bullying tactics to extract \"forgiveness\" out of you. \n\nYour last paragraph is heartbreaking. You seem to think somehow that having an absent, neglectful, alcoholic mother is your fault. It couldn't be less your fault. It's ALL on her. ALL those choices were hers and hers alone. \n\nHaving walked down that road, I can tell you that you don't get closure when you sit down to talk with people like that. You just get guilttrip, gaslight and fake tears. \n\nYou didn't fuck up anything.

She didn't pout the effort to build a relationship and now she expect you to forgive her and act like a happy family after all this broken years ? Sure if you are willing to put effort into it but be prepared that she lose interesst again or just want you to take care of her since she does get old .\n\nThe only good thing she did is leave you at the care of your great aunt and grandma because it seems like they tried their best to raise you well\n\nIt takes more than a sorry to heal a broken relationship . Why dou you feel guitly NOW is it because you still seek her approval and love ? How much does she actually know about you and your life ? I mean she could be also a stranger and it's up to you to open your heart and get it broken", "Nta. My situation is similar. Even though I was stuck living with my mother.

You might not have dealt with it in the nicest way, but I assume that's normal. After what you've been through, especially the way she told you about you being unplanned, you deserve the right to hold a grudge. \n\nIf she is genuinely sorry, she would understand that she needs to the understand she has to do it in a way that will make you feel that she truly means it. And Idk, hope it's the case, but 23 years is a rather long time", "NTA\n\nJust because someone wants to apologize, it doesn't mean the apology has to be accepted. You're allowed to have feelings about all of this as well.\n\nShe is being immature by not talking to her or accepting that she is AT FAULT for so much of it. \n\nGive it more time, if she comes around, she does. But you weren't an AH. She had been planning what she wanted to say, you reacted in the moment. Take some time and sit with all that happened and see where you want to go with her, if you do.", "NTA- the fact that she backtracked at the end shows it\u2019s not sincere.

She\u2019s probably doing it as part of her AA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhile there probably was no real reason for you to ask her to apologize in person, given that you're the harmed party if that's what you want I see no issue with making the demand.\n\nHer reaction, however, makes it sound like you dodged a bullet. She called you specifically to apologize for being selfish and immature. While you might have lashed out a bit, it sounds like you were in your own way restating what she herself had said. Apparently feeling attacked, she the responds with a super mature (/s) version of 'nuh uh, you are!'  \n\nSounds like she might have more healing/processing to do if she's going to contribute meaningfully to a healthy relationship with you .", "NTA.\n\nShe abandoned you. She wasn't just a shitty mother, she was no mother at all. Does she really think that she can repair decades of abandonement with a half-@$$ed apology? And the moment things don't go her way, she starts making excuses and blaming you? Nah. It's not worth the effort. Just let it be and keep living your life.", "you did not fuck up, and you are definitely not TA. she wants something and its not a relationship with you i am sure of it. \n\nsure she apologized today but what is stop her for acting up again, you feel guilty bc you're generally a good person people with a good heart and conscience tend to second guess and feel guilty after standing up for themselves, which you did and should be damn proud of it. \n\nits okay to miss your mom, there is no wrong in that, but its not enough to just forgive and forget the years of neglect. \n\nits okay to miss her and its okay not want to forgive her. If she cannot wait for you to forgive her on your terms than she is not sorry and needs something, for her to turn it out on you, calling you selfish and immature, to then have you calling her is manipulation at its finest.

I do believe she needs a break because she was young and made mistakes, but here's the key: **cutting her slack is other people's job not yours.** I hope there are people around her to support her personal growth, but you are not responsible for being one of them.\n\nIf she was really sorry, she would do things on your terms. Hopefully those people around her supporting her and cutting her slack can let her know that. You weren't immature, she was.", "NAH.
