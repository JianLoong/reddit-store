{"id": 15248, "submission_id": "12sye7p", "title": "AITA for telling my dad and his wife they aren't entitled to anything from my maternal grandparents?", "selftext": "My parents divorced when my brother (15m) and I (17m) were little. My brother and I were always close to mom's family because they were the side who was the most involved in our lives and they were also the kinder ones. My dad's family always made us a little uneasy and were very pushy/demanding. Mom died when I was 8 and a few days before my brother was 6. Dad was already dating his wife Rachael at that point but we didn't meet her before mom died. Rachael had a son and a daughter who were pretty much babies when she and dad met, they were about 2/3 when my brother and I met them. After dad and Rachael got engaged, my dad ended up estranged from his side of the family because they told him Rachael's kids would not be welcome to join their family. Rachael has no family. She was a foster kid who ended up separated from her siblings and they didn't want to know each other as adults. Her kids' dad was out of the picture when she met my dad and his family were not interested in the kids either.\n\nMy brother and I still had our maternal family though. And we continued to be close to them. I know on more than one occasion my dad asked them to include Rachael's kids and when he and Rachael had our half siblings, he asked some more about including all of them. My maternal family and dad were never on great terms and there was no relationship after the divorce so they weren't exactly enthusiastic about it but they did ask my brother and me a couple of times if we wanted to include the others. We said we wanted our time with them to be for just us and that they weren't part of our family with them so didn't want to add them to it. They never told dad but they always said no. Rachael let my brother and I know a couple of times that our grandparents had turned down the chance to spend time with her kids. I think she was hoping we would be upset or speak to them in favor of including her kids. They did try to stop my brother and me from seeing our maternal family. We both kicked up a huge fuss and after a couple of months of being denied any contact, dad gave in and said we'd never have a peaceful home if they kept it up.\n\nThe status quo has not changed. But it bothers my dad and Rachael way more than it used to. It especially bothered because they show up to my hockey games or my brother's football games and because we are now making plans with our grandparents without going through dad first. My stepsister was upset that she didn't have any grandparents for her class's grandparents play and Rachael and dad were talking shit about my grandparents and how they should be filling that role for them. I told them they're not entitled to anything from my maternal grandparents and they need to get their expectations in check after all these years because my grandparents are doing nothing wrong. Rachael said I should care way more about my siblings than adults who chose to be assholes to kids. She also told me I had no right to speak to her that way.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681996710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sye7p/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_his_wife_they_arent/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your Dad and his wife can also be disappointed that the grandparents aren't showing one bit of kindness to a family that literally has no other family.  It's not like your step mom chose to go into foster care and have no parents.  Are they related? No. But jeez, it's cold to be intimately involved in the lives of children who share the same house with other children, know that have no other family and say 'not related and I don't give a crap about you'. Imagine how that feels to someone who had no one care one bit about them growing up since they were in foster care?", "NTA - I see so many stories like that and I keep wondering what is going on in those people\u2019s mind ? At what point do you think your wife and her kids are entitled to you ex wife\u2019s family ? This is so disturbing. Reading from your post I can imagine it\u2019s not really a subject you can communicate freely about at home with them. I\u2019m really sorry for you !", "YTA\n\nYeah downvote me fuckers I don\u2019t care\n\nThe word \u201centitled\u201d means \u201cdeserving of privilege\u201d\n\nYou know that Rachael doesn\u2019t have parents or that your step siblings were not born with grandparents yet you still use the word to remind them of their misfortune when they needed them the most?\n\nIt\u2019s the equal of some asshole kid telling you that you\u2019re not entitled to a meet-the-teacher session because you don\u2019t have a mom, you could had the least bit try to think from their perspective more before making this comment", "NTA \nSorry you\u2019re going through this", "NTA\u2026 why would your mom\u2019s parents have to be grandparents to your dad\u2019s stepchildren? They are in no way obligated to do this nor would anyone expect them to do it.\n\n Your dad and step mom are in the wrong.", "NTA. At all. \n\nYou and your brother are the children. You shouldn't have to explain it all to your dad and step Mom. Rachel's childhood is over. She's a grownup now with her own kids. Your maternal grandparents don't have to fill in for the guy who left their daughter. Rachel, a long time ago, could have started the children in the program Friends, they match up kids with grandparents who have no grand kids. She could have involved them with a program at your local church. She could have not bad mouthed your grandparents. She could have been more proactive on their behalf a long time ago.", "NTA.\n\nYour father's family does sound like they suck, and I feel bad for Rachel's kids, but none of that makes it ok to try and force your maternal side of the family or you and your brother to \"adopt\" them. The worst part is that the more your dad and Rachel try and force something, the less likely it's going to happen.", "NTA. I can somehow understand that Rachel has a void in her life from growing up without a nuclear family and that she wanted that for her children; it must be hard for her not to have been able to give them that, through apparently no fault of her own (it's the kids' father who decided not to get involved, I assume, and it's your dad's family who chose not to include them). But she is misplacing responsibilities and expectations in that regard. \n\nIt's the kids' paternal family, and now your father's family --the kids' stepfamily-- who should have, ideally, wanted to be in these kids' lives and have relative roles in them. \n\nYour maternal family has nothing to do with Rachel's kids. Why would your grandparents have any obligation to \"adopt\" the children of their late daughter's ex-husband's new wife?! Sure, it would've been great if they felt inclined to love and care for your stepsiblings (you don't need any biological or political bond to love a child, after all), but given that they had no relationship with your father after the divorce, the odds of that happening were always close to zero. Expecting different was and is ridiculous on their part. \n\nI think your father and Rachel are assholes because they simply thought \"well here is a pair of grandparents, we'll just shove our kids onto them\", without considering the fact this family has nothing to do with them, their connection is with you and your brother. And I think they're even bigger assholes for trying to use you and your brother as pawns to get back at the family for refusing to accept their kids into it. \n\nI'm very sorry that your siblings don't have grandparents, again, I know it must be hard for them. But they aren't entitled to a relationship with yours anymore than they are to be called grandchildren by the neighbor's grandparents.", "NTA. Your dad and step mom are delusional in thinking your maternal grandparents owe a relationship to their kids.", "NTA. If they want grandparent for their children, they should talk to your fathers family. But it is not the job of your maternal family to care for children, who are not related to them. They want to spend the time with you, and so be it. Sad for your step and half siblings but not your fault and not your grandparents fault, that your fathers family acts like they don't care and that your stepmother has no family.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIf grandparents are so important to them your dad should repair his own relationships rather than mooch off yours.", "NTA - This just seems weird to me that they would want a relationship with with your maternal grandparents. There's nothing wrong with what you said, nothing wrong with your grandparents decisions and everything wrong with your Dad and Step mom.", "NTA. You had \u201cNo right to speak to her that way.\u201d? Wrong you had every right to speak to her that way. She and your father were insulting your grandparents and you defended your grandparents. What did they expect? Another posted said something similar but these people really need to learn their place.", "Definitely NTA\n\nYou're pretty fortunate to have your maternal side of the family, a luxury that your step/half siblings do not. You've gone through a family dynamic that many haven't had to endure. And at 17, you probably lack the empathy for the situation your dad/stepmom/siblings are in.\n\nThe thing is, we don't get to pick our families, and you didn't get to pick yours either. Your dad and stepmom went about this entirely wrong and it sounds like they've gone about it wrong for over a decade. It has probably helped shape your negative view on your non-maternal family and for good reason. They are absolutely not entitled to anything from your maternal grandparents. Family can be more than blood, but they aren't even that.\n\nIt's too bad your dad and his wife screwed the pooch on their family dynamic and created such hostility with their own entitlement. Good luck to ya down the road.", "the way your stepsister feels is your dad's and rachael's fault. not your grandparents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour maternal side has a right to choose if they want to associate with your stepmother. Your stepmother and her children aren\u2019t their blood relatives so she is the AH expecting to force one on your maternal side.", "NTA Rachel and your dad are forgetting two key issues here; You and your brother lost a mother at a very young age. And your grandparents lost a child.         They keep on making everything about Rachel and her kids. I am hoping you can get some peace and I am so happy you and your brother are there for your grandparents.   I hope Rachel and your dad can focus on being decent parents and maybe think about other\u2019s feelings rather than make everything about themselves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
