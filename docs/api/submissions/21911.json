It's not a 15th century ship. He has the full support of the boss, because he is equally misogynistic. Your son needs to learn from you. Don't tell me mixed clubs are riddled with sexual drama. Come on. Sure, teenagers will always be teenagers, but most people go there to work out, not spray their hormones all around. PEOPLE. No matter their shape, size or genitalia. PEOPLE. Unfortunately, people like your son continue to exist. Try to shape him into a better human being. I can see you have your head on straight.", "NTA. They could have made a decision to have an all male gym/class and advertised it at follows, but just deciding to not allow woman in fear of \"accidental sexual harrasment\" is annoying. They are happy with keeping the people who might behave inappropriately and removing the \"temptation\".", "NTA. There were several different ways he could have gone about solving this before just turning away all women. And the guys at his gym seem a bit strange too. I do jiu jitsu and I have sparred with women before. It's only awkward or sexual if you make it awkward or sexual. When I spar, I am there to learn, what sex my opponent is is the last thing on my mind.", "NTA your son is going to have to be able to interact with women without sexualizing them and trying to avoid women in general is an insane way to handle that. He should have the morals to turn away students who can't keep their hands to themselves rather than punish women for being too alluring.", "There's two separate problems here. Is your son an AH for being misogynistic? Yes.\n\nDid you just force someone to quit an adult job they've obviously spent a lot of their young life training towards? Yes. \n\nThere's a reason we normally don't allow kids adult jobs. Because adults get to have their own beliefs and opinions, and they can be terrible opinions, but that's one of the privileges of being an adult. An adult is allowed to do things as they see fit.\n\nSo obviously you're punishing your kid for his beliefs, but what exactly do you think he's going to learn in a year? You've already had 17 and haven't inculcated values you approve of.\n\nHe's going to go back to his job and go straight back to teaching in the same way.\n\nThe whole thing seems like a petty power play on your part.

Perhaps you, your son, and the owner in a sit down so you all can either understand or agree.", "The situation may indeed be driven by misogyny, but you've taught your son nothing here except that when he disagrees with his mother about anything, he'll suffer. Great lesson, that - and unlikely to open his mind to gender issues in his discipline.\n\nYTA for poor execution. ETA: NTA for the desire to help create change.", "ESH as far as I can tell, technically they probably weren\u2019t marketed as an all male gym, so they shouldn\u2019t be able to turn them away, which makes your son an asshole. However, if they do decide to swap to all male going forward, then they should be allowed to, and that is not misogynistic, since the all female boxing gym was okay, and not considered misandrist. You making him quit, which I\u2019m not sure how you did that, was an asshole move.", "I\u2019m not trying to be a jerk when asking this but why is it okay for there to be a gym where only woman are allowed to train but if men want something like that for themselves they are misogynistic? If a guy is not comfortable training with a girl then that\u2019s fine, why do you have to make him uncomfortable in order to make her happy? Why is what she wants more important then what he wants?", "NTA\n\nIf your description of what occurred is accurate then your son was behaving badly. Very badly. Misogynist is an appropriate description.\n\nAs long as he's not 18 yet and living under your roof your actions were appropriate.", ">many of the male students were concerned about \"awkward or inappropriate sexual behaviors and incidents.\" Yet that day my son helped welcome 4 gay/queer young men.\n\nHow old are the students? Cause this reads to me less as sexism and more like they're worried about accidentally touching a boob or getting a boner. Unintentionally awkward encounters.\n\nKind of homophobic to imply that those gay men are going to be sexually inappropriate towards the other students.\n\nYour son is only 17. He probably doesn't know how to address these concerns and was just trying to make his students comfortable in class.\n\nClearly his boss really likes and trusts him, and was okay with his solution. \n\nBy your own description of what happened, it doesn't sound like your son was being misogynistic at all. You got involved in his work - where you have no business being - forced him to quit a job that he loves, and cost his boss and students a good instructor.

It is OK for an all female boxing gym but you think boys should not have the same? Plus, there is a certain amount of violence in martial arts and sparring with girls would be awkward to say the least. There may also be a certain amount of wrestling involved as well. Few teens would not feel awkward in these circumstances.", "were they even there because they wanted to do martial arts or just fill up any room? and there actually was no reason to bring up the gay kids seeing as the only concerned distractions would be the people flocking to the next open thing", "YTA for not raising a better son.", "The owner is the actual ahole here.

Their concern that they'd be framed for something inappropriate that they didn't do is very VALID. Theres a category of social media 'influencers' that wear the tiniest, tightest gym wear they can find & then film themselves in the gym, and calling out men that look in the general direction of them, or coming by them to grab equipment. There's literally so many videos on YT of other influencers calling them out. These women can ruin innocent lives. Its completely understandable why men would want men only gyms. \nJust a question op, did you ever call out the all female gym owner a misandrist?

Female black belt here.  Full contact knockdown MMA.
