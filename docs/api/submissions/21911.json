You suck, because you have robbed your son of his income and independence. The gym owner sucks because he was employing an unqualified instructor. I know that you said that your son has won multiple competitions and has two different black belts, but working as an instructor in martial arts isn\u2019t just about teaching someone the best way to hit someone. There is a great deal of discipline involved in learning a martial art and if your son isn\u2019t teaching his students the self-discipline to not just know when to hit somebody, but also that they shouldn\u2019t grab a girls ass while they are training then he isn\u2019t teaching them a martial art, he\u2019s just teaching them the best way to hit someone. Because he was refusing to allow them into the class on the potential that they might be sexually harassed it also means that he didn\u2019t believe in his ability to control the class and prevent them from doing something inappropriate, which again suggests that this is a job that your son may not be capable of. Your son sucks because he is making his decision not to teach these women because his students said they would be worried about inappropriate sexual behaviour. If the students are worried that they can\u2019t control themselves then it may be more appropriate that they remove themselves from the class until they can. That is presuming that they are worried they will be unable to avoid touching their classmates, if they are just teenagers worried that they will have an unexpected boner while grappling with a member of the opposite sex then that is, again, something that a more qualified instructor would be able to handle better. Also, I feel it\u2019s necessary to make clear to your son that a space that is exclusive to women so that they will be safe from men and a space that is exclusive to men so that they won\u2019t be a danger to women are two very different things.", "YTA for being homophobic.", "I hope you plan on giving your son income to supplement the job you made him quit, YTA big time", "Yta.

I will say, your son is wrong to exclude, but you were wrong to make him quit. Tentative ESH\n\nEveryone here is very quick to jump on the misogyny train, but for some background, I was a martial arts instructor for 10 years, early highschool into after-college. I'm a third degree black belt in my art. I'm a 6'4\" man, and have been since middle school. And I can tell you that dealing with the opposite sex in martial arts is very tricky, from a personal standpoint, from an instructing standpoint, and from a liability standpoint. It's not a problem for most of the older students (over 18), but high school or younger age boys AND girls have no clue how to act around the opposite sex, ESPECIALLY when they are sparring or relying on them for stretching exercises. This is a very heavy contact sport, and there's really no option for \"no touch\" kind of exercises, and AT BEST someone could get hurt, and at worst someone can interpret any of the touching as any kind of personal attack.\n\nHonestly, this isn't a failure of your son, if he's being truthful in saying \"awkward or inappropriate sexual behaviors and incidents.\". He's actually ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. It's a failure of the owner to hire female instructors, and to train all his instructors on dealing with potentially sensitive situations.\n\nAgain, I'm taking your son's word at face value, that he's trying to avoid a situation in which himself or others get in trouble for what should be normal contact within the sport, which can include striking, grappling, throwing. My art uses a lot of throws. A lot of those throws include reaching UNDER THE GROIN. Can you imagine a group of teenage guys trying to teach a girl how to do that? They're simply not mentally equipped for that, they need guidance. And from a liability standpoint for the dojo/gym, men are generally a LOT stronger, bigger, and heavier. Especially teenagers. There needs to be changes made to the structure of the gym, whether it be separated male/female classes, female instructors, etc, to be able to teach those techniques safely.\n\nDo you understand what I'm getting at here? IF that is what your son is worried about, accidentally hurting someone, or risking his legal/social safety by working high-contact with women his age, then again, HE IS NOT TO BLAME AND IS CORRECT TO LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF. But excluding female students is not the way to do that. The school owner has to do better. My advice? Confront him and ask him EXACTLY what he is worried about, with having female students there? Is it just that they can't \"hang with the guys\", or is he worried about getting accused of something or hurting someone? And if it's the latter, you and him need to have a long conversation with the gym owner. If it's the former....well...then yeah, he's just being an asshole, lol", "NTA - he was being discriminatory based on what?\n\nThe gym is not stated to be male only, thus what he was doing is probably illegal and absolutely morally wrong", "NTA because your son should have handled it better.
