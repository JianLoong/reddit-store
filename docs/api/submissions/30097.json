I was furious for him endangering my animal but also my other animals there it could have bitten one of my dogs or other animals. And for that I had said not to open the enclosure but he did anyway. He also shrugged it all off like it was no big deal. And although he didnt do it directly, he caused the terrarium to crack. \n\nSo after words back and forth he brought in our friendsgroup. All reptile keepers. They all sided with him and said I overreacted. \nOne even said to calm down my PMS. \n\nNow in December I was supposed to go animalsit one of their animals over Christmas. \nHowever due to their behaviour I now said I am not helping anymore and I don't need friends who have so little amount of respect to me or my animals and material. \nNow the arguments are all over the place again and they call me all sorts of names. \n\nI wonder.... Did I overreact and should have just kept our animalsitting deal?

It seems like he is afraid that he has to pay up when he admits that he is wrong, so he weaponised the \"friend\"group. I may be reaching here, but I think he already expected them to side with him, it sounds like there is a lot of underlying sexism.\n\nThe person saying you need to calm down your PMS is a mega A, and DEFINITELY not your friend. It is a very disrespectful thing to say to someone who is upset, even if that person is more upset than reasonable, even if that person is actually PMSing. You were not more upset than reasonable, and they are TA.", "NTA, none of them respected you(twice over in that they don\u2019t respect you enough to have concerns about your injury or about your feelings about the situation), your property or your animals. Why on earth would you have any interest in helping people who don\u2019t have a minimum level of respect for you?", "NTA\n\nFuck them all off. Special place of hell for the one (I\u2019m gonna assume a guy) who thinks he can blame anything he doesn\u2019t like on PMS\n\nJust say your views of animal husbandry clearly don\u2019t match with theirs. They should find someone more aligned with their views to look after their animals", "NTA, not only did one \u201cfriend\u201d endanger your pets but the rest sound incredibly disrespectful. definitely find a new friend group because these ones don\u2019t sound worth it in the slightest", "Animals are better than people. You made the correct choice.  NTA.", "NTA \n\nNone of these people are your friends. Youre better off without them \n\nAlso this was gross - \n\n***One even said to calm down my PMS.***", "No, NTA. Your feelings are valid, also they're not your friends.", "NTA you\u2019re right he ignored you, endangered your animal, your other animal\u2019s lives, the fact that you were injured; turned to the friend group for support who not only didn\u2019t offer support but insulted you. These aren\u2019t friends; block them guilt free.", "Nta", "NTA.  How hard is it to understand \"Do not open the enclosure.\"? Did this person find your spider? No. Did they put that and other animals in danger? Yes. Did he not care about it? Yes. Did your other 'friends' not give a fig? Yes. You can find other friends.", "NTA he shouldn\u2019t have gotten into the enclosure if you said no and other pet owners should care your pet was lost. \n\nHowever, I call shenanigans on him being the cause of you breaking a glass terrarium. It seems most likely you made a mistake in doing something, doesn\u2019t seem appropriate to blame him. If my friend accidentally let my cat out of the house and in my rush to search for her I flip over shelving in my garage, that\u2019s on me", "ESH\n\n\"And although he didn't do it directly, he caused the terrarium to crack.\" Uh no, he didn't.  You did.\n\nBut by all means, stop being friends with all of these people.  That'll teach them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The terrarium can be replaced and your hand will heal. \nWithin a month it will all be forgotten.\"\n\nI think I am nice saying it almost 2 months ahead that I am not helping them. \nI think it is really disrespectful to even open the enclosure while I said not to. \nBut if 6 people keep telling you, you are overreacting. It is not that bad.... etc. I am questioning myself. :s", "Yeah it is a guy... \nAnd someone who can't keep a gf. I think I now understand why if he talks like that to women. \nEven if he was joking its still wrong. \n\nI have the conversation silenced but I think I will be blocking them. It would be better to keep to my view here.", "No indeed. We have been friends for almost 16 years now but this I dont need in my life.", "Yeah that one had me stunned for a moment.", "The only way to retrieve the animal was by lifting the terrarium. In that process the bottom shattered immediately. \nThere was litteraly no other way. Even emptying out the terrarium first was not an option there time was also of the essence.... since well the animal could have chosen a run instead of staying put. \nThere was only like have a cm gap, so I also could use anything to lead it out. \n\nI took the time to roll the terrarium on rollers but even that wasn't enough to keep it from shattering since it needed to be moved off the plank the animal was under so I could lift the plank. \nAnd with shattering I mean, the bottom didnt crack... it litteraly shattered", "It is upsetting. Women are capable of getting mad about stupid things other people do even without PMS. We are more than capable of doing that. Just a joke ofcourse..\n\nAll your animals were in danger. And the people coming in your house. Or if the tarantula got out of the house even there it was a threat to others and was also in danger itself. \n\nAlso, if you like your hobby please stick with it and don\u2019t let others ruin it for you. \n\nNTA.", "You shouldn\u2019t question yourself on this\n\nYou gave specific instructions regarding how your animals were to be cared for, they were ignored. Most likely if the person was to watch your animals again, they would repeat the behavior because they have no remorse or repercussions. The terrarium can be replaced, but until it is, your animals that were living in the terrarium have to be temporarily shifted to a new smaller environment, this causes stress in any animal so not ok. Your hand will heal, but that doesn\u2019t address the weeks of healing time it will take where you have to work slower because the injury hampers your movement both to avoid further injury and so the healing process doesn\u2019t take that much longer. The entire group is extremely blas\u00e9 about inconvenience visited on one of their members, why not ask them how they would respond if they had to go through an equivalent situation. Hell id even insinuate that the situation might repeat itself if they insisted on being asses about the topic", "So at any time in the future without the tarantula\u2019s escape moving this would have shattered it?", "No, to move it... It would be unloaded, cleaned and moved with the plank under it regardless. Although empty ofc it can carry itself. \n\nThe problem is that unloading it takes easily 2 hours to make sure the entire soil is safely kept for the animals in it. And the inhabitant also moved. Plants repotted.... its a lot of work. \n\nI came to the point I had to make the decision that was this or lethal for the tarantula.", "You're NTA and anybody whos been in yout situation gets it. I got muddy water all over my living room floor chasing an escaped day gecko lol. My wife who doesn't have any interest in animals was fine with it because she'd rather I get a room dirty then the gecko hide somewhere and die.", "So you were stressed made a choice. That\u2019s fine, sometimes our choices turn out badly. But it\u2019s still not your friends fault. You could have found ways to block the animal from running elsewhere or blocked all exits but one, etc. I believe you that you felt this was the best option but it\u2019s still a choice you made."]}
