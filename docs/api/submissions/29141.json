That's banana-pants.  She can be disappointed, but that's a her problem.   \n\n\nNTA", "Unless you guys were close friends outside of your brothers relationship then NTA it's weird to still crave validation from your ex's family members. My guess is she trying to make your brother jealous or \"win\" the breakup. I've stayed friends with exes before but I've never demanded their family members stay in contact with me after the fact so I can't thikn of any other reason she would want that.", "Unless you\u2019re still actual friends and not just peripheral social media acquaintances I\u2019d say NTA. I sort of hate how entitled some people seem to feel about social media engagement lol", "NTA.. You're not obligated to react to something, especially if it's just because you follow someone on social media. Does she want a disingenuous congratulations? \n\nI wonder if she called out everyone that didn't comment, or just you?! Sounds like she might be trying to get your brother's attention through you. \n\nINFO: How does your brother feel about it? Are they still friends on social media? If so, did he respond to the announcement?", "INFO\n\nWhy did they break up?", "Absolutely NTA. She's just hunting for attention. It doesn't even sound like you two are particularly close anymore.", "NTA Block her and move on.", "Whatever the case, OP\u2019s brother is a lucky man\u2026", "NTA. What? Why does she think you have an obligation to congratulate her?", "INFO: why does she even care so much about you congratulating her?", "NTA\n\nIt's wierd that she specifically called YOU out on it. Does she not have enough followers on social media that she recognizes that you, her exe's sibling, didn't congratulate her?", "Why would you possibly care at all? NTA", "NTA\n\nHer expectation is strange. Why does she care about your approval? Did she call up everyone who didn't react to her social media post? Weird.", "NTA. You aren't obligated - on social media no less - to respond to every positive and negative update that your acquaintances make. She was looking to make drama by checking on your reaction and calling you out on it. That combined with the hyperfast engagement speak poorly of her maturity level and general character.\n\nI would avoid getting dragged into expressing your feelings towards her engagement. If she called you out publicly, I would simply not respond. If she did so privately, I might say something along the lines of \"Of course I wish you nothing but the best.\"", "NTA and it's tacky that she reached out to you to \"call you out\" on this. Seems like she's just trying to cause drama and rub his nose in it. \n\nI would unfriend her personally. I don't need drama llamas in my life.", "NTA\n\nIts absolutely ridiculous to call anyone out on not responding to a post made in the last few hours.  People have lives.  She's way out of line.", "Nta. I\u2019m mad she called you over a post.", "NTA bit unfriend her", "NTA\n\nWhat she's ACTUALLY doing is hoping you'll run back to your brother and tell him so he gets jealous. You didn't comment or like, so she thinks you haven't seen it and wants to tell you directly. Don't entertain it, and if you aren't friends with her, just remove her.\n\nIt's funny how people who \"move on\" quickly are usually the most interested in rubbing it in their ex's face. Almost like that's the entire point.", "How did she even know you saw the post?", "NTA, what a weirdo and a trashy move to call lol", "NTA, you don't owe her a congratulation, it's OK if you do, ok if you don't.\n\nIt's Reddit wild theory time, so was she reaaally with that guy for only 6 months?", "NTA - \u201cenjoy Dateline in 5-8 years!\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It clearly drives her insane.", "\"It felt a bit weird since you only broke up with my brother five minutes ago and I didn't know how to react so I said nothing.\"\n\nSuper tacky. I HATE people who pester you about whether or not you supported their stupid social media post. \"I noticed you only put like instead of love on my post I feel hurt\". My favourite is someone sending me abusive messages for asking them repeatedly to stop proselytising about conspiracies on my Facebook but most importantly not supporting them when my friend put a LAUGH REACT on her comment. Yes, this WAS a woman in her 50s.", "ALso NTA obvs", "So sad that the ex pays so much attention to it. Almost like she wants the ex and his family to know and get a reaction. Kinda sad that.. she should be focusing on her future with her new fiance.. if they exist.", "I'll add that it's a really weird thing to even think about, so it's super weird to actually   reach out to somebody and go \"why didn't you like/congratulate/etc my social media?\" Is she actually keeping tabs?  What a sad way to live!", "I'm not sure if he knows yet, she posted the pic an hour ago but he's asleep right now so I can't text/call him", "They broke up because she wanted to move to a different country but he didn't want to move away from his family.

Didn't even know she had a partner until today", "It was a Snapchat story", "INDEED.", "I'll have to find out in the morning, it's past 12am here and everyone's asleep but me haha", "My thought exactly! I bet she was hoping that if OP interacted with her post that it would push it up in the brother's feed.  She's \"fishing\" for how OPs brother feels about it.  Her poor fiance.", "Wait, she called you upset for not reacting, but it's only been posted for less than an hour?! WTF!? That definitely screams of desperation!! \n\nImo, she's only doing this for your brother's attention and I would question the legitimacy of this \"engagement\" photo. I suggest you unfollow her and ask her not to involve you in her games. It sounds like she's just using you to get to your brother.", "She's probably desperate to see that it bothers you and him.", "NTA\n\ndont even tell your brother about it. if she asks you again say you didnt mention it to him because he said he was over you. shes trying to use you to get a rise out of him.", "Did she move to a different country? Is the quick engagement related to getting a visa or citizenship?", "So it sounds like you don't really know much and you're making assumptions about their relationship. Just because she moved on doesn't diminish her time with your brother.", "Happy Cake Day! \n\nNTA.
