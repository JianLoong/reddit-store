They are from America while I\u2019m from England and my gf came here for uni.\n\nWhile they were visiting a group of my close friends came over. I grew up in a pretty diverse place in England and my friend group is also very diverse. Out of the six of us I\u2019m the only white one.\n\n3 of them are Asian (23M Thai, 23F Indian, 21M Korean) 1 is Jamaican (22F) and 1 is mixed Caribbean (23F).\n\nWhen they arrived I immediately noticed her parents and grandparents whispering. I asked her if this was going to be an issue and she assured me that her family isn\u2019t like that and she was sure they were just talking.\n\nWell they did make some uneducated assumptions (like asking if my Thai friend and my Korean friend were related and calling them Chinese, they look nothing alike. As Well as being surprised that all of their English was so good. All of us except 1 were born and raised here) but my gf quickly sorted these out.\n\nI can\u2019t quite remember but during a conversation her grandmother referred to my two black friends as African America, they told her that they weren\u2019t. She was confused and kept insisting that they were. My girlfriend wasn\u2019t saying anything so I stepped in and said that no one here was African American. My girlfriend looked at me confused and pointed to my friends and said \u201cbut they are black, they are African American\u201d.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help it, I started laughing, so did my friends. This made my gf and her grandmother upset and asked what was so funny. I told her that they were not African American, because they were not American. Upon realising the mistake her parents and other members of her family laughed but her grandmother still looked upset.\n\nThis morning she approached me and told me that I was rude to her family and that I could have just left it. Basically saying that I called her family stupid. I didn\u2019t mean for it to come across that way but I said it was the truth. She\u2019s now calling me TA.

They may not think they're 'like that' but...they kind of are", "NTA. \n\nClearly they are Racist uneducated Americans.\nThey are commenting on something that is unnecessary to bring up unless you clearly have an issue.", "NTA they were being ignorant.", "NTA-it\u2019s not your fault they are uneducated. ETA: They also are very racist. \n\nSigned an African living in America that is also NOT African American.", "NTA. Grandma has a narrow world view and ignores social cues. If she wished to avoid embarrassment all she had to do was ask them why when they said they were not African-American instead of continuing to insist in the face of their declination.\n\nEmbarrassment is by nature uncomfortable. Grandma should know that at her age. She should have defused it the same way her family did, with laughter and a rueful \u201cSorry, I shouldn\u2019t have assumed\u201d.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA, the rest of the family laughed it off didn\u2019t they? You were right to correct them, they need to look at why they think all black people are African American or why they assumed your Thai/Korean friends were Chinese. Or why they were surprised they could speak English? It\u2019s shockingly ignorant at best, depressingly racist at worst.", "NTA they are racist white people. How have you not noticed this yet. They could be just uneducated but her assuming that people from Thailand and Korea are all from the same country do seem slightly racist because you mentioned they looked different and on top of that they assumed they are related. This seems more than just being uneducated.", "NTA. \nI think it\u2019s safe to say the biggest Asshole here is the American education system. \n\nIt was funny tho, I chucked a bit reading this. Her family needs to relax a bit it\u2019s not that deep.", "im Black and live in america. i normally correct people who call me African American because..\nim not. im Jamaican and Caribbean mixed as well as Indigenous. i love my AA\u2019s for life but i don\u2019t accept the title african american because it\u2019s not what i am nor is it my history to claim. you weren\u2019t even rude about it. NTA \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Nta and I\u2019m American. It\u2019s pretty ignorant to assume that all people of color are African American or all Asian people are Chinese. Out of curiosity what party of the states are your gfs family from?", "NTA \nThey were ignorant and racist", "NTA \nThis is why having labels for absolutely everything is getting ridiculous. Korean British or is he just British? Or maybe he\u2019s just a nice guy of Korean heritage. It was funny and again NTA", "NTA - they tried, but they *were* being ignorant, and finding it unintentionally funny (and the cause being their nationalism rather than their racism) was probably the best they could hope for under the circumstances.", "NTA at all, and they were being ignorant but hey since many Americans don't have a passport and haven't travelled to other countries maybe it was just an assumption on their part. Surprised your GF thought that though.", "NTA, I would\u2019ve laughed too.  If anything, it softened the blow of how silly they sounded and added some levity to the situation.", "NTA\nYour partner's family is pretty standard dummy ignorant Anericans. It's more prevalent in the older generations, for sure. You were a bit rude, but if these chucklefucks are going to put the burden of responsibility on you to educate them, best be ready for a lesson. I can't imagine speculating on somebody's national origin based on skin color without being inherently bigoted in some way. You don't just lick those opinions off the ground, you know.\n\nEdit for spelling", "NTA. But your gf must be really hot for you to be willing to overlook the amount of racism", "African-American LMFAO.       That's STUPID-funny.   \n\n\nThe rest of it was racist and not funny at all.     Your girlfriends' family are racist and the fact that she is defending them means she's a bit of a racist too.  You might want to sort that one out, friend.     You are NTA.", "NTA. It's okay to laugh at ignorant people when they're being racist if it embarrasses them, because they should be embarrassed.", "YMBTA- Nobody on reddit was there so we can't know for sure how rude you were but overall I say NTA because.... well because... well you just gave them so many chances. lol They weren't realizing something glaringly obvious and it was funny, you can apologize for laughing but I don't think you should feel bad", "NTA, but you could've just explained it the first time instead of correcting her several times.\n\nIn America the term \"African American\" is the most acceptable way to describe people of color. The words colored people/ black people can get people upset. So yeah, they're very programmed to use those words even if someone is full African-British (I assume you guys just call Idris Elba black?), an islander (from the Caribbean), or some other variety of dark brown skin.", "NAH. Were they ignorant yes, but it doesn't sound like they were racist. Why didn't you just calmy explain it? It is better explaining something, than just laughing. If someone does not know something, and you start laughing because they don't know... That is just rude. \n\n(probably unpopular opinion)", "ESH. You don't think laughing at people for not understanding something isn't on par with calling them stupid? Generally it's racist to think all people of one appearance are the same. But I think sometimes it comes from ignorance, not malice. ESH because like I said it's generally racist, and I don't have enough info on the family to be comfortable giving them the benefit of the doubt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t know what else to say.", "NTA  The family got stuck in the 1960s or something.  You tried to correct them a number of times before they figured it out, and now they are trying to act like the victim?", "Can someone explain to me how they were racist? Extremely ignorant yes, but I don't get the racist part.", "NTA I'm m an American and would have laughed. I have a question for everyone who keeps saying racist or bigoted.\nHave your grandparents ever said anything you find uneducated, ignorant, bigoted, or racist in front of you?", "YTA Were you drinking?  You sound like you were pretty rude.  The USA is a big country and most residents have never left. They are not worldly.  Furthermore people immigrate to the USA to become Americans.  When she was calling your black friends African Americans it was actually her attempt to be respectful.  It's silly but you understand she forgot she wasn't in the USA.  \n\nDo you really have to be the older kid in the back of the bus making fun of the freshman?  If I were your girlfriend I'd be questioning your character.  You can't give her grandparents a little bit of grace?", "I would worry that GF was not putting a stop to this. I would seriously wonder if she thinks this behavior is ok.", "Idk about racist, racism implies discrimination. Sounds to me like GF's family is just unintelligent, not hurtful", "This reminds me of when I visited my hometown with my friends from Chicago. One being Puerto Rican, one being Korean and one Mongolian. My parents graduated high school, but can't point out China/Japan/Mongolia/Thailand on a map. \n\nThey treated all of my friends with kindness and hospitality, but some of their questions were bizzare. Like assuming they were all born in their home countries by trying to be kind to ask what life is like in South Korea etc (my Korean friend was born in the US). Or asking what they ate, assuming they stuck to a different diet. \n\nThe difference was that when corrected, they didn't get embarrassed and awkward. \n\nWe have had many talks since that trip though about what the rest of the US and it's population is like. They rarely leave my hometown, and I never realized how little they understood about the rest of the country.", "American education system has always been an issue. Will be for the foreseeable future, unless something changes. However, as individuals we have the ability to learn so we are not ignorant. Plenty of resources like libraries, videos and the internet in general.", "They are scattered around a bit but most of them, including her, her grandmother and her parents are from Michigan.", "Yup, also in America race is a very sensitive issue and a lot of folks try to be inclusive, but just have absolutely not the foggiest how to properly educate themselves.", "I feel like the laughing was initially a \"ha ha how silly\" and continued because nothing hides fear or embarrassment better than laughter.", "yes because op is very close friends with these people and this might cause conflict between op and his gfs family", "GF also thought the two black friends were African American. Sounds like ignorance runs in the family", "Unintentional racism is still racism.", "Constant othering is hurtful, intentionally or otherwise. And making assumptions about a native speaker\u2019s language skills based on their skin tone *is* racist. The word \u201cracism\u201d can cover anything from this kind of microaggression to violence, as well as outright hate speech, depending on the circumstances.", "Mih-chih-gahn! The land of snow! And... more snow!", "My family is from Michigan too. Can I ask where from? I posted a similar story of mine on this thread.", "True, but 9/10 when you educate a racist you get a non-racist. Claiming they are racist and writing them off does nobody any favors", "This sounds less like racism and more like deep seated generational bigotry combined with ignorance. They tried to ask questions(not the thing to do or the way to do it) but flopped. At least gran is trying. More than my parents can say, they're MAGA hat wearing handbags.", "I'll concede that, Only to add that most racism comes from ignorance. So in certain cases clarification might sound or seem like racism when it is a mere lack of understanding or congruence with their experience.", "Legit met my husband in a bar he was convinced upstate NY got the most snow in the US. I bet him it couldn't be higher than my hometown in northern MI. He lost. By...a lot. Michigan is wild.", "I'm not saying to write them off, but intent only matters if it affects your reaction to being called out. Grandma's reaction should have been an apology and an attempt to do better, if her heart was in the right place.", "This statistic was made up on the spot.  When you educate racist people, you usually get nods and then talk about behind your back as being woke and unreasonable.\n\nThe idea that having a talk with people will just make them see the error of their ways.  That's something you see in Hallmark movies.", "yeah", "That I will concede 100% Grandma a lil racist."]}
