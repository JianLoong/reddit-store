They are from America while I\u2019m from England and my gf came here for uni.\n\nWhile they were visiting a group of my close friends came over. I grew up in a pretty diverse place in England and my friend group is also very diverse. Out of the six of us I\u2019m the only white one.\n\n3 of them are Asian (23M Thai, 23F Indian, 21M Korean) 1 is Jamaican (22F) and 1 is mixed Caribbean (23F).\n\nWhen they arrived I immediately noticed her parents and grandparents whispering. I asked her if this was going to be an issue and she assured me that her family isn\u2019t like that and she was sure they were just talking.\n\nWell they did make some uneducated assumptions (like asking if my Thai friend and my Korean friend were related and calling them Chinese, they look nothing alike. As Well as being surprised that all of their English was so good. All of us except 1 were born and raised here) but my gf quickly sorted these out.\n\nI can\u2019t quite remember but during a conversation her grandmother referred to my two black friends as African America, they told her that they weren\u2019t. She was confused and kept insisting that they were. My girlfriend wasn\u2019t saying anything so I stepped in and said that no one here was African American. My girlfriend looked at me confused and pointed to my friends and said \u201cbut they are black, they are African American\u201d.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help it, I started laughing, so did my friends. This made my gf and her grandmother upset and asked what was so funny. I told her that they were not African American, because they were not American. Upon realising the mistake her parents and other members of her family laughed but her grandmother still looked upset.\n\nThis morning she approached me and told me that I was rude to her family and that I could have just left it. Basically saying that I called her family stupid. I didn\u2019t mean for it to come across that way but I said it was the truth. She\u2019s now calling me TA.

Being an uneducated ignorant white person does not make you racist by definition. They didn't seem to do any overt acts of racism or White nationalist behavior. They just seem to be genuinely idiotic and stupid. I know this isn't a popular opinion but being ignorant of other people races and their cultures does not by definition make you racist.

If someone says \u201cIm not African American\u201d why would that be a debate on why they were wrong. The insistence that they know better than the person itself.

If you had made any rude comments like actually calling them idiots or unintelligent, their reaction could have been understandable but not in this case.", "NTA. I'm assuming they're from an area that's not very diverse, so your gf should have known and at the very least warn you that they are.... Let's say, inexperienced. She ALSO should have corrected them and been listening for these faux pas so that she could deal with them herself.", "NTA. No, it was not a place to leave it, she's an asshole for coming at you to say that you all should just take her family's racism and accept it.\n\nThe family was being ridiculous, they deserved to be openly laughed at. It sounds like you shouldn't be in a relationship with this gal since she not only wants you to eat her family's racism completely, she is willing to go after you if you don't", "YTA  It's completely ignorant and stupid to even think any white American over 60 isn't inherently racist. It's literally how they were raised. It was part of their schooling, their worship, their family conversations, etc. It was the fabric of their community. You can't undo a lifetime of racist teaching from all aspects of someone's life in ONE conversation. \n\nTo villainize the grandma for her lack of exposure to lots of other races when she comes from a country that is literally STILL segregated by neighborhood is unfair at best and elitist at worst. \n\nThe family sounds unintentionally racist, which to me means that having calm, respectful conversations to educate these people might be well received and helpful, instead of laughing in their face and then coming to Reddit to get validation for your complete lack of compassion and elite attitude. \n\nOr do your girlfriend a favor and dump her so she doesn't spend the rest of your relationship constantly trying to live up to your gentrification. \n\nP.S. I'm an American and NO, I'm not a republican.", "They were definitely ignorant but not stupid. I would have politely corrected them and not laughed in their faces. If you really like your GF learn how to roll with her family with patience. I do not believe they were harmful intentionally, just backwards.", "Kinda the ass, if your girlfriends family is visiting from another country, why would you invite so many other people over who you see on a regular basis. Go meet them somewhere and let her visit with her family.", "Honestly, speaking from experience, \"your English is so good\" is also an American thing. I've been to many countries and the most I've ever had that said to me was when I was in the US. \n\nThe US can be very monolingual-centric and consider the typical American accent as \"accentless\". Having someone speak English with an American accent, from a country not known for speaking English is like a wild concept for some reason.", "Had a co worker, a non white woman, who was complimenting another co worker (Latino) on how good his English was. She kept going on and on, despite being told, repeatedly, that the guy was from Chicago. She couldn't wrap her head around the idea that not only was he born in the US, so were his parents.", "It's honestly weird that the term \"African American\" is used while white people get to be just \"American.\" One of the few things I think us Brits do get right about race is that the most accepted term is \"black\" not \"black British.\"", "I lived in DC for 32 years. Our block was 75% black, the rest mixed race, white and Hispanic.\n\nFor family health reasons we moved to Salt Lake City. In our little subdivision it's probably 95% white, no Hispanics or Blacks, maybe 5% Asian.\n\nA lot of US areas are like that so outside of cities there can be great unfamiliarity with non white peoples.\n\nIt doesn't justify this kind of behavior but say knowing if the relatives are from Idaho or Vermont versus San Francisco would add a lot of informational value.\n\nPlus some people are just blockheads..\n\nAnd some are racist.", "I think calling them African American is a bit of a brain fart.", "How do people ever except anyone to learn about anything if the first thing people do is call them racist. Not everything is racist. Being unintelligent, uneducated,  etc doesn't make everyone racist. She's an old lady who probably hasn't been many places and grew up being taught or not being taught what she needed to know. It's easier for us nowadays, when we have information in the palm of our hands (yet you still get those who can't even bother to look up info) to judge older people who's only info they learned was what was necessary depending on class & culture. Try stepping out of your shoes before assuming people are racists.", "Ignorance is magic, friend. It makes a lot of Americans think that all who speak Spanish are Mexican.", "Sounds like the rest of the family did laugh once they understood!", "oh my god shut the fuck upppp. Yes let\u2019s blame the entirety of the American education system for having some racist old bat spout some bullshit.", "Mine did *because they were racists.* Sure, they were ignorant because of the way they were raised, but instead of learning, they would continue the same behavior and justify it with \u201cwell, I don\u2019t mean to insult someone by saying \u2018n#%^*\u2019, it\u2019s just what we said growing up.\u201d There isn\u2019t a chance in Hell I would\u2019ve brought them around my diverse friend group.", "For a long time the lesson was \"don't say black, say African-American\". So a lot of people learned that, but haven't realized that the world has moved on, and that even at the time the \"rule\" was simplistic and not always true.", "You\u2019re not an asshole.  I think some people want to find things to be offended about.", "When I was a child (1980s) a term typically used in the UK was Afro-Caribbean. I haven\u2019t lived in the UK in 20 years so no idea if still used.", "Actually calming people African American and then doubling down is not respectful, it's condescending. You don't have to be worldly to know these things, maybe try picking up a book instead of a gun.", "Lmao, unintentionally racist, man the lengths people will go to excuse racism is amazing. People like you are the worst type of racist.", "Right?  He seems to enjoy thinking he\u2019s better than them.", "Everyone lies sometimes. Is everyone a liar? If so then how can the term carry such a negative connotation? Western society still carries a lot of racist assumptions. Even good-hearted people are going to express some from time to time without realizing it. To call people racist when they do is similarly unhelpful. It is the actions we should be criticizing and not generalizing to paint them as bad people.\n\nI think you are right about OP's girlfriend's family. They likely come from a part of America that isn't very diverse. It's especially common for older people to only be used to dealing with their own kind. The probably are totally unaware of how insulting it can be to be told \"You are well spoken.\" And the African-American mistake is one ignorant Americans often make. \n\nSo thank you for your post. It doesn't seem to me that the family was intentionally hurtful. They just need to be educated and not written off as bad people. Racism is insidious. We have to watch out for it in our own behavior and not just in the behavior of others.", "they all grew up in a time with internet, they\u2019re just stupidly ignorant on purpose. no one is this dumb", "Unintelligent people can do and say hurtful things.", "The rest of it was racist and not funny at all. Your girlfriends' family are racist and the fact that she is defending them means she's a bit of a racist too. You might want to sort that one out, friend. You are NTA.", "You know damn well that\u2019s not why I\u2019m blaming the American education system\u2026. You just choose to play dumb and ignore that it\u2019s so flawed that half the American population act like this \u2026. This isn\u2019t an isolated incident honey. THIS IS THE NORM. Wake up. It\u2019s not a great education system. It\u2019s not even good. It needs reform \u2026 I said what I said. Deal with it.", "Op, as you mentioned they are also not African.", "Ikr. I'd personally much rather the blatant racism than the microaggressions and subtle racism.", "Clearly you know very little about Americans.", "This one I understand, probably because I've made the same mistake. I remember watching the Olympics and saying something about the African-American swimmer. A friend pointed out they weren't African-American because they weren't from America. I felt dumb, but I get making this mistake once. I don't understand the girlfriend insisting that they shouldn't have pointed it out, because how else would her family learn?", "Exactly. Ignorance = racism in this scenario.", "I mean it's just ignorance no? We have different words for different things for a reason. In their minds it's polite to call black people African American but they obviously haven't thought about it deeper than that because they've never had to lol.", "Nta and I\u2019m American. It\u2019s pretty ignorant to assume that all people of color are", "Even in America it doesn\u2019t always work. There are black people from countries outside of Africa.  That being said, it really wasn\u2019t all that long ago where calling someone \u201cblack\u201d was seen as offensive here.", "No, most prefer the term black.", "I take your point, although I would note that GF has been in the UK for a minimum of 3 years, with OP for 3 years, so probably knows his friends pretty well or at least well enough to know that they are not American.\n\nIt could have been a fumble on her behalf, possibly due to embarrassment or feeling the need to protect Grandmother who had been corrected a few times by that point, but it was a daft one.\n\nYou are right, mistakes do get made. But I think the next day argument was partly \u2018ok, Grandmother has made several mistakes now and it is getting embarrassing so I am lashing out\u2019, partly \u2018I looked dumb and you laughed at me, because I (maybe) should have known better after all this time\u2019", "not necessarily. When you educated a racist, you often get a defensive racist. I can't imagine a polite conversation where any of the above assumptions are brought up. Those people were ignorant and racist.", "Exactly, but everybody is racist now. Instead of some people are just ignorant, there is a big difference.", " I would seriously wonder if she thinks this behavior is ok.", ">This sounds less like racism and more like deep seated generational bigotry combined with ignorance.\n\nWith love, what do you think racism is if not generational bigotry and ignorance?", "Racism is bigotry and ignorance. Tf?..", "A few years ago, I was having this exact discussion with a friend of mine (for context, i'm a white chick and he's a black dude.)  We had the kind of relationship that we could have really open, non-judgmental conversations about race, religion, etc.  I asked him straight up, \"Do you refer to yourself African American?\" His response was \"Hell no, I'm black.\"", "Now they do, but there was a time when some found that offensive and now people are scared to say it", "Now this is true.

People know but they still believe the lies they were told their whole life. \n\nOr they know or just don't care.
