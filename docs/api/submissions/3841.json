They are from America while I\u2019m from England and my gf came here for uni.\n\nWhile they were visiting a group of my close friends came over. I grew up in a pretty diverse place in England and my friend group is also very diverse. Out of the six of us I\u2019m the only white one.\n\n3 of them are Asian (23M Thai, 23F Indian, 21M Korean) 1 is Jamaican (22F) and 1 is mixed Caribbean (23F).\n\nWhen they arrived I immediately noticed her parents and grandparents whispering. I asked her if this was going to be an issue and she assured me that her family isn\u2019t like that and she was sure they were just talking.\n\nWell they did make some uneducated assumptions (like asking if my Thai friend and my Korean friend were related and calling them Chinese, they look nothing alike. As Well as being surprised that all of their English was so good. All of us except 1 were born and raised here) but my gf quickly sorted these out.\n\nI can\u2019t quite remember but during a conversation her grandmother referred to my two black friends as African America, they told her that they weren\u2019t. She was confused and kept insisting that they were. My girlfriend wasn\u2019t saying anything so I stepped in and said that no one here was African American. My girlfriend looked at me confused and pointed to my friends and said \u201cbut they are black, they are African American\u201d.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help it, I started laughing, so did my friends. This made my gf and her grandmother upset and asked what was so funny. I told her that they were not African American, because they were not American. Upon realising the mistake her parents and other members of her family laughed but her grandmother still looked upset.\n\nThis morning she approached me and told me that I was rude to her family and that I could have just left it. Basically saying that I called her family stupid. I didn\u2019t mean for it to come across that way but I said it was the truth. She\u2019s now calling me TA.

Being an uneducated ignorant white person does not make you racist by definition. They didn't seem to do any overt acts of racism or White nationalist behavior. They just seem to be genuinely idiotic and stupid. I know this isn't a popular opinion but being ignorant of other people races and their cultures does not by definition make you racist.

If someone says \u201cIm not African American\u201d why would that be a debate on why they were wrong. The insistence that they know better than the person itself.

Ignorant as shit and often racist too.", "NTA what hideously ignorant twats. Get a new girlfriend", "NTA, americans seem to have been programmed to say African American and not black. Its seems to be very common now that they believe every black person is either african or African American and cannot understand that is not the case. Your girlfriend and grandma probably thought they were being culturally sensitive and didnt understand what they were doing was not the right terms outside of America.\n\nmaybe you should not have laughed and explained to them what terms are used out aide.of America", "NTA - I just keep thinking \u201cPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.\u201d If they didn\u2019t want to become embarrassed about their ignorance on this topic, then they could have talked about literally anything else. There\u2019s a whole world of things out there to discuss.", "This is why I only use the term African-American when it relates to discussing history. We don't know everyone's ancestry by the color of their skin. And people who keep commenting that these people are unintelligent are wrong. There are many parts of the U.S. where there are almost entirely white. Grandma was trying. She did something we all do. Focusing on being respectful and not thinking logically. NAH but just explain that you weren't laughing at her, you were laughing with her. We all make mistakes like this. They were gracious and trying. That's all we can ask of anyone.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA, they were being rude by assuming and telling people who they apparently were. Get rekt, as the kids say.", "NTA. You were informing the ignorant. It\u2019s a public service. If her family wasn\u2019t so intent on flaunting their ignorance they\u2019d stop getting served", "The insistence on using African American for Black (or anything denoting Africa) in America can get ridiculous.\n\nI'm African and would often get called African American despite people knowing I'm African.\n\nWorse still, some TV station in L.A. was talking about a new elephant that was born or brought to the L.A. Zoo. This clown then said, \"Ruby the African American, I mean African elephant\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA: your GF and her grandmother kept messing up. Even if I extend grace to the grandmother, the GF should have known better and explained to her grandmother.", "NTA. Her family IS stupid and racist.", "NTA- please don't procreate with this person.", "NTA not everyone black is African American.......", "Lol grandma just upset they\u2019re there", "That's how you get to normalised cultural appropriation such as loud American families claiming they are 'Italian' when no one alive in that family has ever been to Italy and their culture is unrecognisable to actual Italians.", "I\u2019m also Aussie and I get this all the time too. Americans think I\u2019m British, and other Aussies have asked where I\u2019m from because sometimes I guess I don\u2019t sound Australian. I think if you pronounce your words clearly (r\u2019s especially) and don\u2019t sound like Kath and Kim, it becomes hard to tell.", "Well I guess English is only spoken in the United States...\ud83d\ude02", "I invite you to look up the history of the Korean diaspora to English-speaking countries to better understand the context behind why the many-generations-removed Italian families are a nonsensical example to make a counterargument with. Korea has a complicated and painful history regarding a collective ethnic identity despite national boundaries -- a history that started less than a century ago and is still ongoing today.\n\nFurthermore, please consider the racial discrimination/othering that even locally born-and-raised Korean-Americans face regardless of nationality. To be constantly told that you are inherently unwelcome in the place you were born simply because you are of a different race is a difficult thing, and its important to allow the children of non-white immigrants to embrace or distance themselves from their ethnic heritage of their own volition without inserting unnecessary opinions and unfair moral pressures. \n\nKorean diaspora claiming their Koreanness -- when they are likely only one or two generations removed at most -- is not cultural appropriation. In fact, it can often be an act of cultural reconciliation that carries great personal importance. So long as they are not harming anyone else or conflating Korean ethnicity with Korean nationality, what business does anyone have policing them on what they can or cannot say about who they are and where they come from?\n\nPlease be respectful of the varied challenges that diaspora from any part of the world face when it comes to personal identity.", "IIRC, a woke typically refers to someone who was previously unaware or ignorant about another's race or culture. OP stated that he grew up in a diverse neighbourhood with diverse friends. In his group, he is the minority. I didn't read him/they as being unkind. They tried to correct the gf and the family.  For those of us who have dealt with this on a near daily basis, sometimes it is all you can do is laugh.\n\nTry this: Where Are You From https://youtu.be/crAv5ttax2I"]}
