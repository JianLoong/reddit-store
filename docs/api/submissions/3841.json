They are from America while I\u2019m from England and my gf came here for uni.\n\nWhile they were visiting a group of my close friends came over. I grew up in a pretty diverse place in England and my friend group is also very diverse. Out of the six of us I\u2019m the only white one.\n\n3 of them are Asian (23M Thai, 23F Indian, 21M Korean) 1 is Jamaican (22F) and 1 is mixed Caribbean (23F).\n\nWhen they arrived I immediately noticed her parents and grandparents whispering. I asked her if this was going to be an issue and she assured me that her family isn\u2019t like that and she was sure they were just talking.\n\nWell they did make some uneducated assumptions (like asking if my Thai friend and my Korean friend were related and calling them Chinese, they look nothing alike. As Well as being surprised that all of their English was so good. All of us except 1 were born and raised here) but my gf quickly sorted these out.\n\nI can\u2019t quite remember but during a conversation her grandmother referred to my two black friends as African America, they told her that they weren\u2019t. She was confused and kept insisting that they were. My girlfriend wasn\u2019t saying anything so I stepped in and said that no one here was African American. My girlfriend looked at me confused and pointed to my friends and said \u201cbut they are black, they are African American\u201d.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help it, I started laughing, so did my friends. This made my gf and her grandmother upset and asked what was so funny. I told her that they were not African American, because they were not American. Upon realising the mistake her parents and other members of her family laughed but her grandmother still looked upset.\n\nThis morning she approached me and told me that I was rude to her family and that I could have just left it. Basically saying that I called her family stupid. I didn\u2019t mean for it to come across that way but I said it was the truth. She\u2019s now calling me TA.

You don't think laughing at people for not understanding something isn't on par with calling them stupid? Generally it's racist to think all people of one appearance are the same.

Or asking what they ate, assuming they stuck to a different diet. \n\nThe difference was that when corrected, they didn't get embarrassed and awkward. \n\nWe have had many talks since that trip though about what the rest of the US and it's population is like.

For the life of me I cannot understand. \n\nLike, what do they think people in Africa call themselves? When they're nowhere close to the Americas?

I live in a mostly white area and I admit that I am intimidated when going into a richly diverse situation. I'm worried about inadvertently causing offense and saying something ignorant because of my lack of experience.  Reddit has made it clear that I'm not to enquire about somebody's background and culture so it makes learning harder. So I travel via google earth, spending time reading about each county and its culture and history. It's a cheap and fun way to travel but I still feel awkward in social settings. Does my lack of experience make me an AH?

Being an uneducated ignorant white person does not make you racist by definition. They didn't seem to do any overt acts of racism or White nationalist behavior. They just seem to be genuinely idiotic and stupid. I know this isn't a popular opinion but being ignorant of other people races and their cultures does not by definition make you racist. Racism in my opinion involves some sort of overt actions or some sort of lifestyle that excludes demeans or otherwise puts down people of other non-white races.", "As a white American are you really sure you want to be with this girl?

Majority of the time it\u2019s subconscious biases and ignorance. IMO, ignorance becomes racism when the person \u201cneeds to be convinced\u201d. Why? If someone says \u201cIm not African American\u201d why would that be a debate on why they were wrong. The insistence that they know better than the person itself. We are all ignorant on some things but you become as AH when you refuse to listen. \n\nIn this story everyone got there in the end so I wouldn\u2019t call any of this malicious racism. I would also not call these people racist based on this story. Their ignorance and the situation was racist but they themselves are not \u201cracist\u201d if that makes sense.\n\nOne last note, direct racism *and* ignorance can be equally upsetting to a POC.
