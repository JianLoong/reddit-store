My ex boyfriend, his father, went MIA 5 months ago. According to his friends there's been some contact, but he's refusing to give his location and he's refused all contact with me/Benny, his family and his best friend of 20 years. \n\nI was a stay at home mum before my ex left as he earned well enough for me to stay home. Any income I brought in wouldn't have even covered child care for a week. I now work outside of the home, but there's not much wiggle room. Benny has some grasp of this concept, but he's a kid and I don't expect him to understand adult problems. \n\nWith Christmas coming up, I've been really stressed out about everything. I've managed to get a few poundshop bits Benny needed for school but that's about it. My own parents and my exs parents are absolute stars so there's no doubt Benny will be spoiled rotten on Christmas but for a while I was feeling really shit about not having anything from santa for him.\n\nI decided about midway through November to sit Benny down and explain that santa wasn't real in the most child friendly way possible, as well as explaining some mommy's and daddy's don't have much to spend so some kids get less than others. He also understands that many kids will still believe in santa and its important he doesn't tell them our \"secret\" so no feelings get hurt. \n\nThis morning Benny woke up sick so I kept him home from school. My sister called around during the afternoon (she's childfree), she was asking benny was he excited for Christmas and what he was getting off santa. Benny said he knew santa was just a pretend game, so he wasn't getting anything off santa. He was happy out in the living room before my sister decided to pull me on it. \n\nShe demanded to know why a 7 year old knows santa isn't real, and I was honest with her and said it's so there wasn't any major upset on Christmas morning. She thinks I am being a major asshole because I \"crushed\" my sons childhood wonder because I couldn't make sacrifices for his happiness.

That\u2019s a really dumb thing for your sister to get mad at you. He also should learn that gifts can be given as a tradition since it shows appreciation to people.

You can explain that Santa is more of a goodness thing. That around this time of year there are people whose hearts open up a little bit more and they give a little extra to people in need.

The only people on this thread who are saying y t a have truly unhinged takes, so don't worry about it.", "That still doesn't give OP the right to take that belief away from him. I still believed in Santa up until I was 10-11 and my parents never took that belief away from me.", "no, I disagree with that - you have to learn eventually, and the 1st person you look up to for answers is from parents.
