My ex boyfriend, his father, went MIA 5 months ago. According to his friends there's been some contact, but he's refusing to give his location and he's refused all contact with me/Benny, his family and his best friend of 20 years. \n\nI was a stay at home mum before my ex left as he earned well enough for me to stay home. Any income I brought in wouldn't have even covered child care for a week. I now work outside of the home, but there's not much wiggle room. Benny has some grasp of this concept, but he's a kid and I don't expect him to understand adult problems. \n\nWith Christmas coming up, I've been really stressed out about everything. I've managed to get a few poundshop bits Benny needed for school but that's about it. My own parents and my exs parents are absolute stars so there's no doubt Benny will be spoiled rotten on Christmas but for a while I was feeling really shit about not having anything from santa for him.\n\nI decided about midway through November to sit Benny down and explain that santa wasn't real in the most child friendly way possible, as well as explaining some mommy's and daddy's don't have much to spend so some kids get less than others. He also understands that many kids will still believe in santa and its important he doesn't tell them our \"secret\" so no feelings get hurt. \n\nThis morning Benny woke up sick so I kept him home from school. My sister called around during the afternoon (she's childfree), she was asking benny was he excited for Christmas and what he was getting off santa. Benny said he knew santa was just a pretend game, so he wasn't getting anything off santa. He was happy out in the living room before my sister decided to pull me on it. \n\nShe demanded to know why a 7 year old knows santa isn't real, and I was honest with her and said it's so there wasn't any major upset on Christmas morning. She thinks I am being a major asshole because I \"crushed\" my sons childhood wonder because I couldn't make sacrifices for his happiness.

I do wrap the presents at night Xmas eve, usually a little bit tipsy on egg nog lol\n\nNTA", "I mean your kid your choice but I personally think you suck for ruining it for him. Odds are pretty great that he'd only believe maybe a year or 2 more anyway. Maybe you're putting too much into gifts and wanted to relieve your stress but damn.", "NTA this is exactly why we won\u2019t be doing Santa AT ALL with our kid. The magic of Christmas isn\u2019t contained in an imaginary friend it\u2019s in the traditions and time doesn\u2019t with family.", "My parents never did the Santa thing.  I never cared. I still got presents.", "NTA my boys are 13 and 16 and Santa has not been a thing for us ever. I told my kids that me and their dad was Santa and every family has their own traditions and not to tell other kids Santa as they know it wasnt real. They never once ruined another kids fantasy and even took pics and laughed with Mall Santa and what not but they knew I was Santa. I did try and keep the tooth fairly alive tho lol but they told me mom we know you\u2019re tooth fairy too\ud83d\ude02", "NTA - I think you did the right thing. My partner's daughter is 3, and she was told that Santa wasn't real (for similar reasons.) Guess who's sill excited AF about Christmas?", "Nta, best of luck to you .", " Nta and honestly beautifully handled. My almost 9 y old still believes with all of her heart. She\u2019s just so wonderful. Anyway- I know other kids in her class don\u2019t believe anymore and luckily only one has said anything but I dread her being crushed finding out the wrong way (like if she\u2019s teased for believing or something). I think you did great and he sounds like a great kid too", "NTA. I teach this age group. Our school is traditionally upper-middle class. A rezoning a few years ago diversified our student population. I have noticed the shift in their thinking as many start to question the existence of Santa, especially as their critical thinking develops. Most of my students will have a bountiful Christmas, but the few who won\u2019t break my heart as they listen to the others talk about their presents, or when they see the kids bring me presents. Yesterday we read a book about Christmas long ago (yes, in my state we are required to teach about local customs, including holidays) and discussed the simple gifts Santa left in their stockings. A boy told the group that he didn\u2019t get many gifts and didn\u2019t believe in Santa, and I saw something click in the Santa-doubters. Why would the benevolent Santa not bring this really good kid a switch and a scooter and a whatnot? They grew up in front of my eyes as they realized and showed empathy. I\u2019m pleased my non-believer felt safe and confident enough to share that with the group, and grateful his parents had prepared him for the inequity he would face. Im sorry you\u2019re going through difficult times, but you are a great support to your son. Also spot on for telling him not to spoil it for the others.", "You were going to tell him that life's not fair any way (the some parents don't have as much to spend bit) so you didn't really need to tell him that Santa's not real. \n\nIf on Christmas day he asks why Santa didn't get him as much as anyone else, you say some people get more than others, that's just how life is. It's basically what you did say anyway but without revealing Santa isn't real. \n\nAlso how is it relevant that Sister is childfree?\n\nIt is none of Sister's business so my vote is ESH", "I've been the kid sat there wondering why santa gave me my cousins hand me downs. Always thought he was a cheeky bastard that nicked my gifts for his habit until my brother wrote santa isn't real on the 9 things I owned. I then realised we was poor as shit.\n\nOps honestly doing the best she can, like my mum did when she got me an advent calendar for my birthday thats on Christmas eve. Second funniest gift I've ever received", "This is EXACTLY why all big, expensive gifts come from me and my kids' dad. I want them to know that they come from us, and I don't want my kindergartner to unitentionally hurt anyone by saying something", "WTF did I just read?", "My daughter is 10 and still loves boxes.  \n\nThe cardboard box was actually inducted into the Toy hall of fame a few years ago", "I actually burst out laughing", "We do the same- Santa brings stocking and \"family gifts\" usually a puzzle, board game, and a lego set we all do together.\n\nMy kids know the truth about Santa- we told them it was a game and figuring out the truth means that they won and now they get to help keep the Magic alive for every believer.", "That's how it's always been for me too. We got candy and essentials and \"little\" gifts from Santa. Every big ticket item was under the tree from our parents/family. I still loved opening my stocking", "We do this too. Santa brings everyone Christmas jammies, fills the stocking (after I load the bottom with socks so he isn't too taxed,) brings a family board game, and when my son was little and still believed a small gift from his Santa letter.\n\nWe lived in a pretty low income area and while not rich, liked to get him 1 big thing. I didn't need him going to school bragging about some big gift from Sanata.", "Same. We also gathered his outgrown toys each November, cleaned them up and made sure all the parts were there, then donated them to Goodwill.  Explained that some parents couldn't afford to buy brand-new things for their kids. He'd get so excited about donating!"]}
