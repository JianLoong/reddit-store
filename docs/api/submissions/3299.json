From the information at hand, I suspect there is more to the story though.", "NTA\n\nJaz needs to learn that you don't ask questions you don't want the answer to. Talking about people and smearing them behind their back and then acting surprised when they 1-find out and 2-don't appreciate it is pretty foolish.\n\nWhy was she reaching out to you on her honeymoon? I've had two and on both occasions, we shut the whole world out with tremendous glee at being entirely alone. Of course, that was before FB, Instagram, whatever. \n\nJaz should probably also keep in mind that her new friends, if they talk about other people the way they did you, they'll do the same to her one of these days, if they're not already. Hard lesson to learn sometimes.", "I'm going to say NTA. Sounds like the whole thing was just one catty high school issue after another. Sounds like you've grown up and she hasn't. \n\nMove on, better friendships await!", "N TA, she asked and you answered. Just get new friends because these ones are broken.", "NTA. If she didn't want an answer during her honeymoon she shouldn't have messaged you during her honeymoon.", "NTA How pathetic do you have to be to call someone whilst you are on honeymoon to ask why they didnt wish you happy birthday\n\nTbh you shouldnt have even gone to her wedding and should have confronted her infront of everyone when you heard what they said to the cousin\n\nShe isnt your friend, the truth is the truth, she asked.

She asked. She took time out of her honeymoon to ask.  Since she did that, no problem with telling her.", "NTA. She asked the question and you spoke your truth. Since she was on her honeymoon why is she even reaching out to you? It seems to me that Jazz is one of those people that keep \u201cfriends\u201d around so that they can adore her. It\u2019s always about her. Since you didnt trip over yourself wishing her a happy birthday, she had to find out why. I guess she learned not to ask a question if she doesn\u2019t want to know the answer.", "NTA. Do yourself a huge favor and block all these people and move on from this.", "NTA, no you had the right to say your peace and end the relationship.

What did the friends say about you behind your back?\n\nObviously is an issue, personally you'd be better off without these people in your life as much as losing friends suck.

Time to cut her out of your life at this point.\n\nShe is the one who called you during her honeymoon. She should have waited until later if she didn't want to chance having her mood affected.", "We\u2019ve been friends for 10+ years and have never had an argument. So i think maybe she\u2019s just shocked. I think the only info that\u2019s missing is she never really liked me, maybe has some past unresolved issues she\u2019s never addressed and instead of talking to me she talks about me.", "Same. Wtf?", "I honestly wish i never accepted the moh role and regret being so agreeable even after everything but I\u2019ve definitely learned my lesson. Never again!", "It sounds like she only invited you out of getting use from you. The way she treated you was not the way of a friend\n\nThis right here. My prediction is her other close friends didn\u2019t want the title and the responsibility of being moh so they collectively decided to use me instead", "I definitely skimped on some details for word count sake but Jazmine and i have very different separate friend groups. I think her friends have never liked me and talk bad about me and since I\u2019ve moved away she\u2019s joined in and started disliking me too. I love fashion and will use every opportunity to create a moment or look (lol). They\u2019re a little more low key and don\u2019t care about fashion as much. So they always comment on my outfits with back handed compliments. Like \u201coh wow you\u2019re always so overdressed!\u201d Or \u201cof course you wore that\u201d what\u2019s low key to me is wayyy over the top to them. I say this to just paint the picture of difference here. This goes for almost everything. I can definitely see how these things can create feelings or give some ppl something to talk about for entertainment. i think difference is fine and not a reason to treat people like shit. They obviously do not think the same.", "It sounds like there probably is, which is weird because there's a lot of irrelevant information that is included.", "Honestly, that was the vibe I got. They're jealous. Keep dressing the way you do and do you :) \n\nProbably best to go nc unfortunately since you have a great friend group although it sucks to lose a best friend, you're not going to be happy having her in your life. \n\nIf jazmine asked why, just say it's obvious the other friends are more important and you do not wish to have a friendship with someone that allows her friends slander another friend behind their back.\n\nYou will go through stages of grief, but you'll quickly find a lot less stress and happiness for doing so. It's never a good idea to keep friends that either slander you behind your back or allow other friends to slander you behind your back while turning a blind eye.\n\nThere's no such thing as being overdressed. I'm a guy that wears adidas shorts 75% of the time outside of work  and I wouldn't bat an eyelid if I met someone who took pride in their appearance. \n\nThe only people that make comments like this are toxic and insecure people. Since jazmine has also started doing it, best to distance yourself from her and find other friends that appreciate you for you.\n\nEdit: I should add my long term girlfriend has decided to start dressing me and has picked a lot of outfits she likes and i like wearing them, turns out adidas shorts were a comfort because I had no fashion sense and get anxious when shopping for myself, she enjoys picking my outfits so win/win. \n\nDressing up made me feel a lot more confident, happier and helped with my self esteem amd I understand why people like my partner puts in hours to get ready."]}
