She should have waited until later if she didn't want to chance having her mood affected.", "We\u2019ve been friends for 10+ years and have never had an argument. So i think maybe she\u2019s just shocked. I think the only info that\u2019s missing is she never really liked me, maybe has some past unresolved issues she\u2019s never addressed and instead of talking to me she talks about me.", "Same. Wtf?", "I honestly wish i never accepted the moh role and regret being so agreeable even after everything but I\u2019ve definitely learned my lesson. Never again!", "It sounds like she only invited you out of getting use from you. The way she treated you was not the way of a friend\n\nThis right here. My prediction is her other close friends didn\u2019t want the title and the responsibility of being moh so they collectively decided to use me instead", "I definitely skimped on some details for word count sake but Jazmine and i have very different separate friend groups. I think her friends have never liked me and talk bad about me and since I\u2019ve moved away she\u2019s joined in and started disliking me too. I love fashion and will use every opportunity to create a moment or look (lol). They\u2019re a little more low key and don\u2019t care about fashion as much. So they always comment on my outfits with back handed compliments. Like \u201coh wow you\u2019re always so overdressed!\u201d Or \u201cof course you wore that\u201d what\u2019s low key to me is wayyy over the top to them. I say this to just paint the picture of difference here. This goes for almost everything. I can definitely see how these things can create feelings or give some ppl something to talk about for entertainment. i think difference is fine and not a reason to treat people like shit. They obviously do not think the same.", "It sounds like there probably is, which is weird because there's a lot of irrelevant information that is included.", "Honestly, that was the vibe I got. They're jealous. Keep dressing the way you do and do you :) \n\nProbably best to go nc unfortunately since you have a great friend group although it sucks to lose a best friend, you're not going to be happy having her in your life. \n\nIf jazmine asked why, just say it's obvious the other friends are more important and you do not wish to have a friendship with someone that allows her friends slander another friend behind their back.\n\nYou will go through stages of grief, but you'll quickly find a lot less stress and happiness for doing so. It's never a good idea to keep friends that either slander you behind your back or allow other friends to slander you behind your back while turning a blind eye.\n\nThere's no such thing as being overdressed. I'm a guy that wears adidas shorts 75% of the time outside of work  and I wouldn't bat an eyelid if I met someone who took pride in their appearance. \n\nThe only people that make comments like this are toxic and insecure people. Since jazmine has also started doing it, best to distance yourself from her and find other friends that appreciate you for you.\n\nEdit: I should add my long term girlfriend has decided to start dressing me and has picked a lot of outfits she likes and i like wearing them, turns out adidas shorts were a comfort because I had no fashion sense and get anxious when shopping for myself, she enjoys picking my outfits so win/win. \n\nDressing up made me feel a lot more confident, happier and helped with my self esteem amd I understand why people like my partner puts in hours to get ready.", "Info: what did she tell them about you? Just having an over the top dress aesthetic isn\u2019t enough for her cousin to ditch you after talking to them. It sounds unpleasant but your vagueness sounds like you are hiding important information.", "NTA. This girl has NEVER been your friend, you've been an associate of convenience for her and she's used to you embiggening her for whatever she does. In return for your friendship she has bad mouthed you to everyone she knows and used you and your money to have a nice wedding. Cut her loose and move on to friends who cherish you.", "NTA! Sounds like the friends are jealous of you and want her to join in on the jealousy. They seem to be the type of friends that wants others to be miserable as they are", "Ok. So let's go through this and look at exactly what \"Jazmine\" did. \n\n1. Asked you to be her moh.\n\nYou were surprised she didn't ask one or both of these other girls. Still, not exactly a crime. \n\n2. She asks both of these other girls. \n\nWhich... you are somehow shocked by? And blame her for? \n\n3. The other girls take over plann- wait, no, that's other people not Jazmine.\n\n3. The other girls leave you behi- hang on, that's other people again. Still not her. \n\n3. Some married dude flir- nope, still not the bride. Dang. \n\n3. You tell her about Flirty McMarriedman, she doesn't believe you. \n\nThis one is actually her bad. She really should have believed her best friend/moh here. Even over the best man. Though it is hard to believe such awful things about someone you have previously had high regard for, so it's an understandable error.\n\n4. She believed the next girl to come forward. \n\nThis looks bad but is quite reasonable actually. She had some time to think, look for clues, think back on his previous behaviour, and most of all there is now an independent third party with a corroborating report. That's hard to dismiss. Maybe should have apologised for not believing you sooner though? \n\n5. After her cute cousin asks you to be his date, he then blows you off completely. He claims Jazmine, Nancy, and some others said horrible things about you. \n\nOk this one is just bizarre. They told him to stay away, so he did, but then also told you all this? Can you give us more detail about these rumours he was allegedly told? Anyone who can corroborate whether this actually happened or not? \n\n6. There is no 6.\n\nOf the five charges against her, 1 2 and 4 can be dismissed off the bat. Asking you to be her moh is obviously not a sin. And if you say you expected her to ask \"one or both\" of the others, then you are clearly aware of the concept of multiple moh's. You even point out the reasons why they might be wanted in a bridal party. And yet you resented them being there? Or you just resented the way they treated you? Because that's seriously not Jazmine's fault. I feel like you are blaming her for the way her friends acted. \n\nThe only thing here that she herself did that even remotely warrants being called an AH is the slandering of you to the hot cousin. Did you confirm that this actually happened the way he described? \n\nSeriously, give us more detail about this bit because most of this is just you bitching about a horrible weekend and blaming your friend for it.", "NTA. I wouldn't even bother with her anymore. I'd ghost her and find better friends.", "NTA.  Jaz doesn't sound like much of a friend, I'm sorry.  From reading your story, I can't even figure out why she asked you to be in her wedding at all, it doesn't seem like she actually likes you very much.", "There\u2019s missing info for word count purposes but i felt like i left in what mattered most. If there\u2019s anything i can add to complete the story for you Lmk.", "Honestly was just trying to make word count \ud83d\udc80 i had an overly detailed post prior to editing. But of course it\u2019s not just aesthetic. I was just trying to paint the picture that we would never be friends if it wasn\u2019t for Jazmine. They basically just told him not to talk to me because they wanted him to talk to another bridesmaid they wanted to play match maker with. He told me they said \u201cshe\u2019s way better than me\u201d and \u201cmore attractive than me\u201d that i was full myself. I know it happened because i saw them talking to him and thought i heard them saying my name but was so inebriated and distracted with different friends and ppl i assumed i was hearing wrong.", "Bingo! I hate to even talk about them like this because it probably makes me seem jealous or hateful. But it\u2019s true.", "I mean when you build rapport with someone for over 10 years you wouldn\u2019t exactly expect behavior she displayed. I was surprised she didn\u2019t ask them FIRST since they would be the easier choice according to location and access to wedding things. And the l fact that they are in best friends and have been for about the same amount of time as we have. Maybe longer. If you ask me and then try to back door 2 more I\u2019m gonna find it bizarre. Why ask me in the first place? If i bring a friend along for something as serious as my wedding I\u2019m going to treat them well. Of course she can\u2019t control her friends or their behavior but mutual respect is not uncommon or unheard of no? To me unwarranted disrespect towards anyone in the bridal party is a direct shot at the bride. She\u2019s just bringing together the people she loves. Why choose now to go out of your way to be disrespectful? At the very least if I\u2019ve done something horrible then address it. I was never directly addressed. Just talked about for no real reason as far as i know. and my best friend joined in. I\u2019m not wrong for having a problem with that.\n\n\nAnd yes i actually heard the cousin slander. But was drunk and distracted by friends i hadn\u2019t seen since i moved away. I thought maybe i was just hearing things. Or thought at the very least that maybe they were saying good things.", "Ok i thought i was going crazy. She doesn\u2019t like me. And that\u2019s okay but why ask me to be apart of one of the most important days of your life? Thank you for the validation.", "The question is, has that lack of arguments been due to getting along, or because you've always found excuses \"she's just joking\", \"that's just how she is\" or similar things.  It's very unusual for someone to suddenly start acting this way so I'd be looking over your history and checking in with your psyche about that possibility.", "The information was relevant to me. I felt that including it showed where i felt wronged during this whole wedding process and showed why im holding some resentment here. I took some abuse (by choice) for her big day only to find out in the end that she was talking bad about me too.", "Don't feel an ounce bad about those people/friends if they speak about you in that form, they're showing their true colors. No one would speak about anyone in that form unless they're petty and jealous of others while being insecure of themselves.", "I can honestly say i thought it was because we get along so well! We joke and tease each other but never in a malicious way. At least so i thought. Now I\u2019m really questioning if there\u2019s something i missed. As far as i can tell nothing i missed except for what she didn\u2019t tell me.", "May be they didn\u2019t offer their wedding planning services so she picked you as MOH.
