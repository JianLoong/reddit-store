My dad made a reservation for a restaurant for my family and three people of my choice including my boyfriend (22M) and my close friend (24F). We needed a last person but my dad suggested my boyfriend\u2019s twin brother. I like him but I\u2019m not close to him and it didn\u2019t make a difference so I told my dad that I just felt comfortable with inviting my boyfriend and my friend. (I told him this multiple times).\n\nWhen we were at the graduation dinner, my dad against my wishes goes and tells my boyfriend to invite his brother. Without thinking I spit the word no in front of my boyfriend. He got a bit mad at me and questioned why I didn\u2019t want his brother at my dinner. I tried talking things through by explaining that this is something super personal to me and I just wanted the people closest to me. My boyfriend understood and we moved on.\n\n\nToday my dad starts saying that I should\u2019ve not said that and that I was a bitch to my boyfriend because of it. \n\nThis feels a bit unfair since I told my dad I didn\u2019t want him to come to my graduation dinner because 1) we are not close 2) sometimes my boyfriend ignores me when he is with his brother 3) although I get a long well with him I know he wouldn\u2019t invite me to something like this 4) this was supposed to be a celebration with the people closest to me \n\nINFO: my family tends to be critical of me and often manages to portray me as the bad person to the point of exaggerating situations.

This was a special evening for you, and it should be up to you who you share that with. Not including the brother does not mean you do not like him, it's just that you don't have that kind of relationship with him. Sure, efforts can be made to change that if you want, but I don't think this was the right setting to start that.", "NTA\n\nyour Dad caused this. You are not to blame", "Does anyone else think it\u2019s sort of weird that her dad wanted the boyfriend\u2019s brother there even after she said no?\n\nNTA", "NTA - you were asked a question, which you answered, and it was incredibly rude of your dad to try to trap you in a bad situation in front of your bf and to later call you a b\u2014-. Wow. He must be thrown by the fact that your bf respected your wishes and didn\u2019t make a thing of it.", "If your dad hosted the party, you were just the guest of honor? So, the guest list wasn't only up to you? I hate being forced into a corner, personally, so I understand your resentment and unhappiness. However, I don't really get how you figured you were entitled, unless you were paying for this? (People who gift us don't usually just say, \"Whatever you want is fine with me!\" after all? Their wallet gives them influence?)\n\nAt any rate, your dad forced your hand publicly and then you made a bad matter worse by being rude. Sorry. Your dad is responsible for the awkwardness he created - not you. \n\nHonestly, I think your dad was being large and in charge because he paid for the party?\n\nNTA", "Your logic makes no sense, it\u2019s OP\u2019s graduation dinner. OP is not close to the brother, it\u2019s not their brother but boyfriend\u2019s brother. Why should they invite someone to a dinner that is a celebration for them, that they are not personally close with? OP reasoning is their own. Dad asked, OP said no, that should have been the end of it point blank, full stop. OP is NTA", "Yeah I hope it is because Dad is obsessed with efficiently utilizing purchases, cuz if not....", "Yeah, I totally agree with you!  It\u2019s so bizarre and random that her dad insisted on having the twin brother there.  From what she\u2019s described she isn\u2019t close to the brother so why in the heck would her dad be fixated on it.  She\u2019s obviously NTA but she is focusing on the wrong issue.  She needs to know the rationale for her dad\u2019s insistence, because it\u2019s just really strange.", "Sounds like her dad was finding a reason to ruin the dinner. The drama isn\u2019t over yet. NTA.", "The first paragraph states that, other that OP\u2019s family, the other 3 people were her choice.", "If you read between the lines. The OP sounds jealous of the close connection of the twins and not wanting the brother there is how she controls them", "I\u2019m not trying to control them. I\u2019ve hung out with them and invited him to my house parties, events birthdays. My graduation was a personal thing and I felt I was going to be awkward for him to be there especially with my family", "I think you hit the jackpot.  I feel stupid now for not picking up on that.  My great aunts were identical twins and my grandmother was the younger sister.  She used to talk about how hard it was because the twins were a unit and she was the odd person out, because it was just the three of them.", "You said you were not close to him, but now you say you hangout, invite him to house parties, events, birthdays. Those sound like personal things. You were not awkward during those times. Yeah, YTA", "House parties with like 20/30 people? Sorry that\u2019s not the same as a literal graduation dinner. And I invite him because of my boyfriend most of the time and because I don\u2019t dislike him\n\nI have more than one friend but I wanted the people closest to me. Why should I invite him and not some other friend? Your logic makes no sense"]}
