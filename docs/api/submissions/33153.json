Wow. He must be thrown by the fact that your bf respected your wishes and didn\u2019t make a thing of it.", "If your dad hosted the party, you were just the guest of honor? So, the guest list wasn't only up to you? I hate being forced into a corner, personally, so I understand your resentment and unhappiness. However, I don't really get how you figured you were entitled, unless you were paying for this? (People who gift us don't usually just say, \"Whatever you want is fine with me!\" after all? Their wallet gives them influence?)\n\nAt any rate, your dad forced your hand publicly and then you made a bad matter worse by being rude. Sorry.

NTA.", "The first paragraph states that, other that OP\u2019s family, the other 3 people were her choice.", "If you read between the lines.

My graduation was a personal thing and I felt I was going to be awkward for him to be there especially with my family", "I think you hit the jackpot.  I feel stupid now for not picking up on that.  My great aunts were identical twins and my grandmother was the younger sister.  She used to talk about how hard it was because the twins were a unit and she was the odd person out, because it was just the three of them.", "You said you were not close to him, but now you say you hangout, invite him to house parties, events, birthdays. Those sound like personal things. You were not awkward during those times. Yeah, YTA", "House parties with like 20/30 people? Sorry that\u2019s not the same as a literal graduation dinner.

Instead of accepting what you wanted for YOUR graduation dinner, he brought it up again in front of your boyfriend and you for the 3rd time time said no. Your boyfriend was not upset by your decision. THEN your father then proceeded to chastise you on his behalf. \n\nYour family (dad at least) appear to create situations to purposely paint you into a corner as the bad guy.", "NTA.  Your reasons for not wanting bf's brother there are sound and reasonable,  not petty or hurtful.  It wasn't your idea to invite him, you did give your guest list to dad and it sounds like you were clear in your answers.  Dad is not cool at all to try to stir some unnecessary drama into your happy occasion.  Also, congrats on your achievement!", "Why's your dad so obsessed with your boyfriends brother?", "NTA. Your dad seems very controlling. He called you a bitch because you didn\u2019t give in and he wanted to punish you for it. If other family members are going along with him, it\u2019s because they are also AHs, don\u2019t want to get on his bad side, or have been conditioned to agree with him. Sorry you have to experience this.", "NTA. Your father is, though. He went against your wishes and invited someone when you did not want that. Then he harped on your refusal after your bf was OK with it. Your father is a controlling jerk. Don't let him pay for anything else because he is buying your control and invading your boundaries.", "NTA, you shouldn't have to keep saying the same thing over and over.

You\u2019re an adult and don\u2019t need him to be inviting people on your behalf.", "NTA, especially if your boyfriend was understanding when you explained it to him. At the absolute most maybe you should apologize to your boyfriend if his feelings were hurt? Dad is being a little too nitpicky at you.", "NTA. Your dad created this situation for his own amusement. I hope you get to go far away from this family soon.", "NTA\n\nyour father is actually disrespectful.", "It sounds like he wanted the attention that twins bring when out together in public.", "NTA but your dad sure is. From now until he dies, be sure to invite people he doesn't like to his parties and milestone celebrations.", "NTA\n\nYour dad worked hard to make you the bad guy on what should have been a celebration of you. Twins definitely end up in their own world at times and shut out others. It would make sense you would want his attention on you. Hopefully you can cut out the toxic family members who are needlessly critical when you become more independent.", "NTA. It's your graduation dinner, not your dad's. What your dad did was a dick move.", "NTA - This is on your Dad for disrespecting your wishes.", "Sadly, you chose a bf who is just like your father. They both ignore you. Break the cycle and choose a man who actually listens to you.", "Different POV.  If your father believes or has noticed the bond between your bf and his twin is very strong he may have been trying to include the twin in order to foster a better overall relationship between the three of you.  Your being jealous of the amount of time attention that your bf gives his twin is not indicative that your relationship is going to thrive.", "Kinda YTA coz how can you get close to your BF twin brother if your going to treat each other like that? If your planning long term relationship and marriage in the future with your BF then you and the twin brother needs to at least spend time all together especially he\u2019s your BF twin brother and twins are really close with each other and if one feels the brother is being disrespected or not treated like a family then your relationship will not last long in the future. but for sure your father is the YTA coz he shouldn\u2019t have done that coz you will be put in an awkward position with your boyfriend and might think you\u2019re not treating his twin like a family or a person that has importance to you", "YTA and maybe your father for picking the wrong time to try to teach you to not be an asshole (but is there really a good time to try to teach your daughter to not be an asshole?).\n\nYou must not like your boyfriend very much or don't consider this relationship very seriously because you don't want him to be around his twin brother.  It was going to be a dinner for 8 people.  Adults can handle having 1 person they don't particularly want to interact at a dinner for 8 people.  Not everything in life is going to be 100 pct about you.  You can suck it up having your boyfriends twin brother sitting at the same table with you for a couple of hours.  Yes it's your day/dinner but that doesn't mean no one else's feelings matter.\n\nAlso, could you have considered that your boyfriends brother may not have accepted the invitation?  So you could have allowed your father to extend the invitation and the brother could have declined. Everyone's happy.  The brother could have accepted and you'd have had to make a polite greeting and more or less tolerated the brother for a couple of hours.  You're less happy (though I suppose here you could make the choice here of being absolutely miserable because you didn't get your way) but everyone else is happy.  But you chose to be the asshole here; your father looks like he raised an asshole, boyfriend looks like he's dating an asshole and you're alone happily being the asshole.", "NTA, why does your dad want the brother there so badly?", "NTA", "NTA, but your Dad is.....  \n\n\nCould it be deep down that your Dad prefers your BF's brother to your BF and hopes you may start looking that way rather than toward your BF ??", "NTA.  Tell your dad he\u2019s an asshole for being such a dick.  He needs to upgrade his listening skills as well as his emotional awareness skills.", " Nta let's hope he dosent bring him anyway I'd dump him.", "NTA. Time to move out and never come back. Your dad's a bully.", "NTA but if your family treat you like this why have them in your life at all. They don\u2019t care about your wishes or respect you so why have them there.", "NTA! Your dad on the other hand is a judgemental, meddling, a$$hat.", "NTA\n\nSo is your dad sleeping with the twin brother or?", "I think it\u2019s really weird how adamant your dad is about inviting the brother. Would he have invited him if he weren\u2019t a twin? Just really odd\u2026", "NTA. Your dad is the T A for explicitly trying to bring your bfs brother to an event about you after you already declined.", "NTA   Very odd that you told your dad several times that you didn't want your boyfriends brother to come.   WEIRD that your dad went above and beyond to get his way and make you uncomfortable in the process.    Your dad is the AH...", "NTA \n\nYour dad obviously still thinks you're incapable of making adult decisions.  Put him on an info diet.", "NTA - your dad sounds like a bully.  \nAnd - Congratulations on graduating from college! \n\ud83c\udf93\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18", "NTA - your dad, AH. Reasons are obvious.", "It's not like you invited your boyfriend's family, BUT his brother. Your dad is being dramatic. It's your graduation, and it's your choice.\n\nNTA", "ESH  \n\n\nIt was a dinner. Not a cruise or some vacation. You were likely in a building with a ton of other people you didn't know well either, but they were sat at other tables. You say you have no issues with your bf's twin brother, that you just aren't close. You also say if he had something like this he wouldn't invite you... That's a rather shallow way of looking at a matter. Maybe inviting him could be the start of getting to know him better. It just seems like a squandered chance, or worse with how you reacted.  \n\n\nNow your Dad is also a piece of work. If you say you only wanted your BF and friend and he went ahead and invited the twin, that's shitty. However, you word it as saying you felt comfortable with your bf and friend. Did you actually say no? It's no excuse, and if you tell someone multiple times your boundaries and then they are crossed, the person who crossed them is in the wrong. Just something to consider in the future - strong boundaries don't make you an asshole, they make a situation clear.", "Hmmm maybe dad wanted her ignored by boyfriend so dad could have all her attention. When bf present dad feels slighted\u2026", "Dad, I'm not a bitch, you're an AH and you don't like it that I said no. Please move away from your parents, go low contact and move on with your life.", "NTA, your dad seems to have a weird need to be seen as a generous and wealthy person, and is ignoring your feelings.

This is bizarre.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Does your dad have a history of sexism? This sounds to me like sexism. A: He called you a bitch; B: He's undermining your (his own daughter's) explicit wishes in favor of what your boyfriend might want; and C: He's getting pissy about it when he embarrasses himself when you have to shut his nonsense down in public and calls you a bitch (Did I mention how he called you a bitch?)\n\nI reiterate: NTA.", "INFO:\n\nWhy was your dad so insistent on you filling that third space? \n\nYou\u2019re NTA but I just find it weird that he\u2019s so obsessed by that", "Dad seems like someone to have in OP's life in small, defined doses, where OP is in control.", "yes i thought it was odd he kept pushing for it and then still gives her crap afterwards.", "Does anyone think it's weird her dad called her a bitch? This is abusive, and shouldn't have happened under any circumstances!", "NTA- yeah. And what she said about her family painting her in a bad light.\n\nIt would make sense for an intimate dinner to have those closest to her there.  I would have a one-on-one with the boyfriend. Just make sure no ill intent was portrayed.\n\nAnd maybe talk about how she said she feels like she gets less attention when he's there too.\n\nBut yeah Dad doesn't seem on her side.  Dad seems like he was trying to cause issue.", "He drove the whole thing for nobody knows what reason. Weirdo.", "I bet her best friend is a girl and the father wants the \"good ole boys\" club.", "He just wanted another person.\n\nIt sounds like he had already made the reservation for 8 and expected her to find a third person to invite other than her boyfriend and close friend.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have a third person to invite so he suggested her boyfriend\u2019s brother. \n\nHe should\u2019ve asked her to start with who did she want to invite and this could\u2019ve been avoided.", "This is something my Mexican parents would\u2019ve totally done, \u201cno seas grosera, invita a su hermano\u201d", "Dads banging the brother", "It sounds like a narcissist behavior on her dad's side (the \"always critical and make me look like a bad person part\")", "My dad likes having things in control most of the time and he doesn\u2019t understand limits or a no for an answer.", "I can\u2019t think of any reason ever a dad should call his daughter a bitch.", "It wasn\u2019t a party it was a graduation dinner which she understandably wanted it to be family and the people closest to her. Sounds like Dad doesn\u2019t like to be told no for any reason. If he thinks it\u2019s a good idea- then he expects everyone to accept it\u2019s a good idea, regardless of other people\u2019s feelings. He struggles to prioritize others opinions even over things they should really have priority over- like how they want to celebrate a major accomplishment they just completed", "So when someone pays for your dinner, they choose what you get to eat?", "Her graduation dinner should absolutely be 100% about her.", "You\u2019re response is crazy. She noted that she isn\u2019t close with her brothers twin - would you expect a guy to have to invite his girlfriend\u2019s sister to his graduation dinner if he\u2019s not close to her?! It\u2019s such a bizarre take. \n\nIt\u2019s her GRADUATION dinner- it\u2019s literally for HER. The point is to congratulate and celebrate her for her accomplishments - her feelings and desires should absolutely take priority. Has no one ever prioritized your feelings?! Is that why you think everyone should just eat their feelings and grin and bear it?!", "So I don\u2019t want my boyfriend to be close with his brother for not wanting to invite him to my graduation dinner party? This is a bold and untrue statement. My father is teaching me to not be an asshole by disrespecting my wishes and crossing my boundaries? Sure he\u2019s definitely teaching me to not be an asshole!", "Think dad is a controlling AH", "Yeah, I think her dad was trying to tear her down in some way. Why else would he call his own daughter a bitch for something (that was barely even an argument) between her and her boyfriend?\n\nI\u2019m betting he has a history of trying to make happy moments for OP stressful and/or unpleasant. My dad used to do this when I was younger\u2014on many birthdays there\u2019d be some huge angry outburst over something petty, and the family celebration plans would basically be canceled. I spent most of almost every birthday as a teen trying not to cry.", "Yeah, my dad would do this too. If he found something that made me uncomfortable or unhappy, he\u2019d use that information at every opportunity. \n\nOP\u2019s dad figured out that her bf ignores her when his twin is around. He insisted that the twin comes because it makes OP uncomfortable. He told the bf to bring the twin because dad wants to damage OP\u2019s relationship with her bf. Now the dad is using the drama that *he* started to call OP a bitch. He\u2019s likely using this as \"evidence\" that OP deserves to be treated badly. \n\nOP needs to greyrock her dad and go to therapy.", "He did, but he ignored her and told the bf to go ahead and invite him in front of her, probably assuming she\u2019d be too polite to say no (again). \n\nThis whole thing is super weird though. OP is NTA for me.", "Her father sure is something.", "Maybe next time don't invite your Dad.", "He understands.

Outrageous.", "Your dad sounds like a huge misogynist.", "You recognize that you are an adult no longer let your father control your milestones and pay for them yourself.", "Don't listen to the above BS.
