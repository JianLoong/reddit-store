{"id": 10493, "submission_id": "117jrkc", "title": "AITA for not telling my MIL my husband and I are having a baby?", "selftext": "My (33F) husband (37) and I are due to welcome a daughter via surrogate in three months. The process has been a long one, going on for about 18 months. \n\nI am pretty close with my parents, despite living in a different country, especially with my mum, so they were aware of what was going on when we decided to start a family, and have known about all the major developments since then. My husband, on the other hand, is not close to his parents. He speaks to his dad more often than his mum (they're divorced), but on average he speaks to his dad every 2 months and his mum every 4/5, same with his sisters. I have only met my MIL once, at my wedding, and have answered the our landline when she's called a couple of times in the years we've been married, but even then the conversation has amounted to, 'Hi...Let me fetch \\[husband\\] for you'. My husband doesn't talk much about MIL either, so I know the general area she lives in in our home country, what her job is, and that's it. All this to say, I have no contact with her.\n\nSo, a few days ago I was home, my husband was also working from home. I answer the phone, it's MIL. I say I'll fetch my husband, she immediately starts screaming, asking why she had to find out from her ex-husband that we are having a baby. I had no idea she didn't know about the baby, and told her as much, but all I got was an earful about how disrespectful and dishonest it was for me not to make sure she knew. She said I was wrong for not reaching out to her at any point. When she was finished I just told her that what she does or doesn't know is up to her son, and took the phone in to him. My husband later apologised for me having to put up with her behaviour and said that he has told her to contact him on his phone from now on. He said the last time he spoke to her properly, was so early in the pregnancy we weren't telling anyone yet, and he intended to tell her next time she called, and didn't expect her to take it that badly.\n\nI don't understand why MIL expected me to manage my husband's relationship with her, it seems a bit sexist that she'd assume I would be responsible for letting everyone know. He's her son, I don't even have her phone number. However, when I was speaking to my mum about this she said I should have found it odd that she hadn't sent any flowers/gifts in congratulations and I should have asked my husband if she knew since I know he tends not to update people on life events. Again, I don't see how this is my fault. My dad said it wasn't my fault, but he can see why MIL would be hurt and that I should reach out to her from now on. My husband says his mother was out of line and I shouldn't feel obligated just because she threw a tantrum, but even friends I've mentioned this to seem divided.

Your husband did not tell her, she can scream at him.", "NTA. She is your husband\u2019s mother and it\u2019s his and HER job to communicate effectively. It\u2019s not your job to do that communication for them. Her reaction also indicates she isn\u2019t deserving of your time anyway.", "NTA  You are correct, it is not your job to manage his relationship with his parents.", "NTA. You have nothing to feel bad about. This is on your MIL only.", "NAH, as you said, it's his mother. No decision was made to exclude her. That was a function of their infrequent communication.\n\nHer outrage is totally understandable. \n\nYour husband is the closest thing to the AH. He could have prevented this.", "I know the full history, and yes it's a little bit messy, but to be honest it mostly boils down to the fact that my husband left home at 15. He did most of his growing up without her, they're just not close. He isn't a spiteful person, he doesn't exclude her on purpose, it's just that when things happen in his life, his family are never the first people he thinks to tell.", "This isn\u2019t the 1600s anymore.  Grow up.  I assume you\u2019re against adoption also?", "Her outrage is only understandable towards her son. Her outrage towards her DIL makes her an AH", "Oh good. Then it sounds like there\u2019s no harm in making suggestions in the future, but continue to let him make the decision for his family.", "NTA and your parents are wrong. It's not your job to manage your husband's relationships with his family or become his admin assistant. This type of kin keeping, mental load, emotional labor, whatever you want to call it, is expected of women when it's not expected of men and you're right - it is sexist. \n\nThank goodness your husband is doing the right things in backing you up.", " NTA - your husbands relationship with his mother is his business. Him not informing her is between them and not your fault. Is it strange to a lot of people? Yes. Lots of people have active relationships with their in laws so it would be weird for them not to mention it. You are not them. Does that make it your responsibility? No.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you be responsible for telling a near stranger about a pregnancy?", "NTA for obvious reasons.\n\n>My dad said it wasn't my fault, but he can see why MIL would be hurt and that I should reach out to her from now on\n\nDon't feed the crazy.  There is a reason her son has limited contact and you should keep that going.  Next time she calls and yells at you just hang up.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to have contact with MIL especially if husband doesn\u2019t not want that. Just forget about it and don\u2019t worry.

In pregnancy you want to announce to people you\u2019d want support from early on. And then surrogacy adds the extra layer of judgement often times, my intended parents chose not to tell anyone but immediate family about the pregnancy until after birth due to judgements and opinions.\n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s involved in your lives so little that you won\u2019t really have to deal with her much at all moving forward.", "NTA \n\nClearly.", "NTA.   If that\u2019s how she acts I think you have a clear picture of why her son is low contact with her.  I wouldn\u2019t let it worry me at all - you have no relationship with her whatsoever, so not your responsibility to tell her anything.", "NTA. Sad to say, lots of people are sexists who lack common sense.", "NTA your husband knows his mother better than you or any of your friends and family. If he's that low contact with her, there's got to be good reasons for it. Believe him when he says she was out of line and you shouldn't feel bad about it. Congratulations on your upcoming baby, and let your husband deal with his mom.", "NTA\n\nYour husband's knows his mother best. If he says you're NTA then you're NTA everyone else's opinion is irrelevant.", "She doesn\u2019t exactly call to catch up or build a relationship with OP why would OP call her? I would have told her to stop screaming and if she didn\u2019t simply hang up and tell her son to call her back.  Don\u2019t take abuse from someone like that and it sounds like there\u2019s really no wondering why she has a poor relationship with her son"]}
