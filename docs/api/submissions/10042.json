I have some childhood friends that I would like to have there, they are two siblings. My parents are also friends with their parents. Several years ago my sister had a bit of a falling out with the older sister and they haven't spoken since. By default, the other sister has stopped talking to my sister too. \n\nThe falling out was over a difference of opinion, (I won't get into it here) but it wasn't anything REALLY bad. My friend has handled it as gracefully as possible but my sister has continued to cling to it with all her might, even though she claims to not care about it. It comes up in conversation constantly and it's very tiring. My sister has a strong personality and takes everything as a personal attack. So when I talk to her, my default is to just nod my head and smile.\n\nNow the wedding is coming up and, of course, I want my sister there but I also want my two friends, their husbands and their parents there. My sister made a comment last week that \"it's your wedding but why would you choose to have them there after how they've treated me?\"\n\nI feel like how they have treated her has nothing to do with me. I did not have a falling out with them. We are not as close as we were when we were kids but I've continued to stay in touch and we will still hang out when I go to my hometown to visit. \n\nMy fiance is very supportive of my choice to have my friends there and thinks my sister is being really selfish. I know he's right and I'm considering un-inviting my sister because I am anticipating trouble with her and my friends there, plus alcohol. I just do not trust that there will not be a fight. And I know my sister would be the one to initiate it. \n\nWould I BTA if I just uninvited my sister instead of my friends? I should also mention I'm getting married twice in two destinations. My sister would be at the first wedding but not at the second (the one in my hometown). She is expecting to be at both.\n\nEdit: ok I\u2019ll elaborate about the fallout. Essentially my sis has some REALLY strong opinions about covid and they are of the extreme right wing variety. I\u2019m not big on politics and try to remain neutral. My friend is an ER nurse and watched countless people die during the pandemic.\nNaturally, my sisters opinions highly offended my friend, who simply blocked my sister on the socials and that was pretty much it.\nMy family and I actually agree with my friend. My sister has been unapologetic and firmly believes this was very extreme of my friend. \nMy sisters unwillingness to acknowledge her comments were offensive is the reason my friend has not been willing to talk further. \nI agree with my friend and so does my family. But I\u2019m also loyal to my sister. \nI\u2019ve no idea what to do\n\nEdit 2: I was afraid of being identified with the fallout info, which is why I was reluctant to share at first", "created_utc": 1676478741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11321o9/aita_for_uninviting_my_sister_to_my_wedding/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You, too, are entitled to your opinion! And because it is your opinion, and your wedding, your sister will need to take a deep breath and swallow her views if she wants to be there.", "Agree.  I would have a 1:1 conversation with sister and explain that you want the other two people there.  Explain that you want her there two, but ask tactfully that she not engage with the others, and you don't want any fighting.  At the wedding, sit them away from each other, although that won't really work at a reception where everyone is mingling and alcohol is flowing.

Now that I've seen your edit about the nature of the disagreement, I think you should do whatever will make you happiest! \n\nAside from the merits of your sister's views on COVID, her reaction to being blocked by an ER nurse who was most likely just trying to protect her own mental health is totally unreasonable! She is entitled to share her views on social media; other people are allowed to take issue with them and, when necessary, block them so as not to be harmed by seeing them. Your friend did absolutely nothing wrong to your sister, and I think it's completely unfair of your sister to be framing it as though she's been wronged by her to try to manipulate you into uninviting a lifelong friend. For the sake of your relationship with your sister, you could just have a conversation and be firm with her that the friend is invited and she is expected to be civil, or she should not come. Remind her that the day is not actually about her! But whatever you do, it should be the thing that will allow you to enjoy your own wedding day the most!", "In my opinion you're not taking sides by inviting both. If you were actually to uninvite your sister, you'd be taking your friends' side. Talk to your sister before the wedding and stress how important it is to you that she doesn't make a scene.

She can attend and behave herself or not, but you shouldn't have to exclude other people who are important to you. I wouldn't uninvite your sister unless you feel you need to, as that would be a bigger step and more of a \"picking sides\" move that would likely affect your relationship with her. But inviting important friends who haven't done anything other than disagree with her is not a slight or attack on her, and she needs to understand that.

If they argue, primarily your sis, you can not nod your head and say yes stand your ground", "OP, is your sister the type who will STFU about her beliefs during the events?  Or is she the obsessive type who will rant on an on and on about her current hobbyhorse no matter where she is, and make everyone else miserable?", "NTA. Who needs a Q-anon at their wedding?  \n\n\nDon't bring your sis. Ever. Celebrate life and love with those who seen how easily it slips away.", "INFO: why can you have the invites out and just lay down the rule that both parties are invited and both have to behave at the wedding should they choose to attend?", "NTA, and to be fair, sometimes you have to excise toxicity from your life. In this case, misinformation on a major health crisis is not just a difference of opinion. You should probably look at all of here socio-political views and see if they line up with actually being someone you want in your life. I've cut more than a few off, nearly completely, due to very hateful and toxic views.", "Sorry, sounds like the sister would just find a new victim. At least have someone on notice to deal with her if she gets out of hand...the greatest wedding gift of all \ud83d\udc95", "NTA\n\nHaving 2 weddings makes things easier. She can come to 1 or none, those would be her options.\n\nI would definetly run from any kind of \"sure dispute\" at my wedding. I actually did :) and for us it worked. So you should choose what you really want.", ">Just anti-covid vax\n\nNot gonna lie, that's a slippery slope there...and she must be sitting at the top of the slide right now.\n\nA buddy of mine had to hear some absolutely heinous shit from people while working in a hospital during covid...like since he worked at the hospital he was really \"responsible for killing people so the hospital could get those sweet covid bucks\" and he was a \"pharma tool\" getting spiffs from Pfizer and others I'd never seen mentioned even on r/HermanCainAward or r/QAnonCasualties. And some of these were from family like Aunts, Uncles and cousins.\n\nLots of people there begin their stories with \"it all begin between 2015-2017\" and amplified as they increasingly spent more time online. I hope your sister finds her way out of the rabbit hole but keep in mind...many don't.\n\nYour sister wants to be at both weddings to make a point to this person. They love their idea of \"being in the know\" and wants their \"told ya so\" moment with this person. If they truly didn't care about said friend, then she wouldn't care about NEEDING to be at both.", "https://imgur.com/a/WN65reF", "I have ended a 35 years old relationship myself not very long ago over a similar argument, with the other one sharing ideas with the sister. I was absolutely disgusted by my ex-friend's insensitivity, am still in shock over the depth of her ignorance, and find her very hypocritical because she does care a lot about healthcare, but only when her family needs it. You get the picture.\n\nI just don't think going deeply into an argument like this, in this discussion, is very helpful. It's really hard having family members who have such opinions."]}
