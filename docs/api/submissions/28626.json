FWIW, gender reveals have nothing to do with the niece/nephew (it's not like they're choosing anything or aware they're happening), it's another party for the parents.

Honestly, reading Reddit I've seen so much \"a step parent is not a real parent and shouldn't try to be\" that what she said isn't even that much of an issue.

You not being there has nothing to do with the relationship you will have with this person once they are actually here and growing up.\n\nThis party is about adults who want everyone to make a big deal over something that has nothing to do with how they will lovingly guide this person into adulthood.

I respect it all. But people who say that often act like they're on some high level of life and look down on those who have kids. \n\nI mean many who have kids often are terrible to those who don't so I can understand the animosity from a particular person. \n\nBut child free is a stupid term. Kids are not an accessory.", "Adultism???? Jfc o would've laughed right in her face.", "Awwww cute", "Hahah I love the downvotes. Soft.", "I mean the point of the program is to get kids of all backgrounds to enjoy the museum and not see it as a weird elitist thing, but there's a difference between treating people with respect no matter their age and not being able to say \"stop putting your hands on the very valuable art\" without it being seen as somehow abusive."]}
