I understand if John can't make it to the party.\" \n\nI was just shocked when she said that. Did she really expect me to miss my kids play? I told Ashley that John, Noah, Bella, and I would all have to miss if she couldn't reschedule.\n\nWhat she said next disgusted me. She asked me why I would rather go to my \"step\" son's play than my \"actual\" sisters gender reveal party. I told her that Noah is my kid and that that is just a sick thing to say.\n\nShe ended up rescheduling the party so that I could come. The only issue is now I'm not going at all because of the comment she made insulting my family.

I'd demand an apology and frankly tear your sister a new one. That was incredibly disrespectful of her. \n\nBut also - gender reveal parties are for the parents, to be all excited about their baby. Your unborn nibling isn't gonna give two fucks whether you attend or not.", "NTA. She said a horrible thing about your family, and that nasty exclusionary attitude is going to bleed through in the way she interacts with Noah, if it hasn\u2019t already. \n\nGender reveal parties are 1000% about the parents and their egos.

That\u2019s an awful thing to say.", ">The only reason I kinda feel like an ahole is because this party is about my first niece/nephew not Ashley.\n\nIt really isn't. Your niece / nephew isn't born yet. Gender reveals and 1st birthday parties for that matter, are for the parents. \n\nNTA and your sister owes you an apology and she needs to be told in no uncertain terms she's never to treat your son any differently because he isn't blood.", "Nah, gender reveals are ridiculous anyway", "NTA\n\nTerrible thing to say by your sister and not going is completely justified. FWIW, gender reveals have nothing to do with the niece/nephew (it's not like they're choosing anything or aware they're happening), it's another party for the parents. You can still be very involved with your niece/nephew without having been at this event.", "NTA but you should forgive her. Did she apologize? If she does, go to the party.", "NTA. Disgusting.", "You're right. This party is about this new baby who will hopefully have close relations with their cousins. Stop.the drama and go. She made a stupid comment. You can hold on to it forever, or you can focus on the little one. \n\nWhen your sister has children, she'll understand more how inappropriate her comment was. As it is, she DID reschedule for you. So go.", "NTA - What an ignorant thing to say! I\u2019m sorry. How did you respond to her? If you haven\u2019t confronted her about it, you should.

Your sister is throwing a daytime, weekday gender reveal?\n\nThis is why people think a lot of these stories are made up.", "NTA, but go to the party. Your sister's first reaction was insulting, no question about it, but she actually listened to you, accepted your answer and did better. When people correct their stupid views and do better, this should be supported.\n\nIf it will make things better, talk to her again, tell her that you never want to hear about your son not being your son, but it seems like she's learned this lesson? Honestly, reading Reddit I've seen so much \"a step parent is not a real parent and shouldn't try to be\" that what she said isn't even that much of an issue. She thought your family dynamics was different as many families have it that way, you corrected her, she agreed (she wouldn't have moved the date otherwise) - time to move on, unless it's not the first time she tries to exclude your son.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
