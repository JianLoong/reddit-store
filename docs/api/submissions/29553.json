I feel like I constantly give and make sacrifices for her. It's never enough she just always wants another thing. She guilt trips me. I am a bit of an introvert and I like feeling comfortable in my own home.

He will never leave and OP\u2019s possessions will probably go missing. OP, do you leave for work during the day? Get multiple cameras because your gf seems like the person who might let her brother in your house when you\u2019re not home. I already know this relationship isn\u2019t going to end well.

He needs to take responsibility for himself and he isn't going to do that if his sister keeps supporting him.", "NTA . Even if he didn't have a drug problem, co-habitation is very difficult. Y'all are still navigating the early stages of your new family unit all under the same roof. Take that time just for yourselves.  Your GF shouldn't be burdened with the responsibility of her brother, it's great that you can help shield her from that. Give all your love to her, and her son. \nI understand she would like to help her brother, if he needs a shower maybe yall can pay for a gym membership for him (under his own name, and paid directly to the gym). Maybe he can come over for a meal every once in a while. But you should not allow ANYONE to move in with you right now. \nI don't like the way you are already building resentment toward how much she \"contributes\" to the home. What's that about? Are you feeling taken advantage of? Is this only about the brother, or is there more you may be upset about? \nI hope you can have an honest conversation with her, and what the future looks like for your family. \nGood luck, I wish Y'all the best.
