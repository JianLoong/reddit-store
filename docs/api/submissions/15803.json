Prior to that I would pay the bills and let him know what his share was.  Both arrangements have worked.  However, there have been times that both of us have helped the other out and it wasn't a big deal for either of us.  We aren't exchanging IOU's or anything like that. Also, after 16 years together we are a family...he's not just my boyfriend so for me it feels a little different than OP's situation.\n\nIt's hard to say that it's a bad relationship, but it feels like if they are having problems working through this utility increase it could be an indication of problems communicating in the future over money.\n\n\\*\\*Edited to add that we split groceries, and other variable costs.  We do budget billing for utilities so it's a set payment each month.", "No they're all in my name", "Part of it is for savings then the rest is for plans she has so frivolous things", "What she made more, but they\u2019re living somewhere *he* wants?\n\nThis may get deleted for being off-topic, it\u2019s just always my first question when the \u201ccouples should split bills proportional to income\u201d thing comes up and I\u2019ve never come across an answer", "The hive mind will judge us all.", "\"I make slightly more but not much\"\n\nNTA, then.
