Also apologies for any errors I haven\u2019t had time to sit down and think much \n\nI (38m) am transgender I was born female to male and realised at age 16, as soon as I could I started hormone therapy and taking testosterone, this is important.\n\nI have an ex, we will call him Mike (37) he lost custody of our daughter who we will call Ali (16F) 12 years ago after we split and he went on a bender, and was caught and jailed and lost custody,  so I raised Ali by myself, she knows what her father did, and a few years ago she wished to go meet him again, I was hesitant at first but I\u2019m weak for my daughter so I let her go, with supervision of course, I could not face him so I sent my mother to watch which she was ok with, but ever since a couple months ago, Ali has been introducing me to her friends as her mother, and referring to me as she, I won\u2019t lie that hurts, as I\u2019ve been open to her about my identity and how it\u2019s ok if she feels similar. I snapped last week as she was emailing her teacher as we missed a parent interview, and the teacher asked if it was alright to speak to her father and she replied along the lines off \u201cMy Dad\u2019s currently at a friends right now, I live with my mother though, she can talk to you\u201d I get her school emails and when I read it I cried, but I ended up going into her room, and taking her computer, iPad and switch away, she cried saying that was her stuff and I told her too bad it\u2019s mine I payed for it and I won\u2019t give it to someone who won\u2019t respect me, she proceeded to scream at me and called me a terrible woman, that was all I needed to hear, I broke all of the items in front of her, and told her to pack her bags, because I don\u2019t want to see her here any longer and she go stay with her addict father, she cried all the way to his place and I dropped her and left, Ali and Mike have left me voicemails and messages saying they wish I get into an accident and I will always be a woman, I told them I\u2019ll see them in court over harassment.\n\nMy mother says I was too harsh, that Ali is going through puberty, and I need to be patient with her, and I have had guilt eating me up inside so reddit AITA?\n\n\nEDIT From what I\u2019m seeing her I am the asshole, but telling me I\u2019m doing this to stir up transphobia for clout? Is ridiculous and I\u2019m sorry it seems that way, I\u2019m going to see her next week, I let my emotions get the better of me, and she is coming home I will sit down with her, and talk, and I just hope she can understand I was terrible, much more then her, and her messaging me telling me I hope I get into an accident Wasnt fair either, I will ask if she wants counselling and therapy, and if she wants the items I broke repaired,  if she wants she is able to stay at a friends house to think, I am going to try and convince group therapy with the both of us though, thank you reddit,", "created_utc": 1671937456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zup7ql/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_can_stay_with/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I highly recommend you not only message her apologising, but agreeing to replace the items you broke. If her father is an addict, do you really want her living with someone like that when you could potentially provide her with a safer place to live?

But no since I was a little kid I fought against racism in my own family. One of my core memories I have is saying no not all x people are bad and like giving my parents examples and all this stuff. So all the YTAs that are giving your kid a break over being transphobic, no stop making it seem that they're 2 and don't know better.

It\u2019s clear to me that she chose a side, and that side is her fathers side in a quarrel that her drunk of a father decided that he would include her. She will probably hate you for sometime, and people will not hear the story you tell they\u2019ll hear hers. \n\nOn the flip side, as a parent you have to sometimes suck up the brattish behavior your children will show. They didn\u2019t choose to come into this world, and they didn\u2019t start the quarrel between you and your ex, so your anger at her behaving like the child she is, is quite frankly an over reaction. Unnecessarily breaking her things, included. (Yes I know you bought them).

Whether your daughter calls you her mother or her father, she is sure to call you a shitty parent. She is a teenager going through a rough time. Of course what she did was wrong. So what? That doesn't excuse your behavior. You don't get to be abusive (kicking out a minor child that you have custody of is abuse) because you got your feelings hurt.

Also apologies for any errors I haven\u2019t had time to sit down and think much \n\nI (38m) am transgender I was born female to male and realised at age 16, as soon as I could I started hormone therapy and taking testosterone, this is important.\n\nI have an ex, we will call him Mike (37) he lost custody of our daughter who we will call Ali (16F) 12 years ago after we split and he went on a bender, and was caught and jailed and lost custody,  so I raised Ali by myself, she knows what her father did, and a few years ago she wished to go meet him again, I was hesitant at first but I\u2019m weak for my daughter so I let her go, with supervision of course, I could not face him so I sent my mother to watch which she was ok with, but ever since a couple months ago, Ali has been introducing me to her friends as her mother, and referring to me as she, I won\u2019t lie that hurts, as I\u2019ve been open to her about my identity and how it\u2019s ok if she feels similar. I snapped last week as she was emailing her teacher as we missed a parent interview, and the teacher asked if it was alright to speak to her father and she replied along the lines off \u201cMy Dad\u2019s currently at a friends right now, I live with my mother though, she can talk to you\u201d I get her school emails and when I read it I cried, but I ended up going into her room, and taking her computer, iPad and switch away, she cried saying that was her stuff and I told her too bad it\u2019s mine I payed for it and I won\u2019t give it to someone who won\u2019t respect me, she proceeded to scream at me and called me a terrible woman, that was all I needed to hear, I broke all of the items in front of her, and told her to pack her bags, because I don\u2019t want to see her here any longer and she go stay with her addict father, she cried all the way to his place and I dropped her and left, Ali and Mike have left me voicemails and messages saying they wish I get into an accident and I will always be a woman, I told them I\u2019ll see them in court over harassment.\n\nMy mother says I was too harsh, that Ali is going through puberty, and I need to be patient with her, and I have had guilt eating me up inside so reddit AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You gave birth to her. Mothers give birth. From her perspective, you are her mother. I know you identify as male, and want others to address you in that way, but your daughter doesn't know you in that way. She knows you as the one who carried her for 9 months... which is what a mother does. \n\nI know that what I'm saying is not politically correct, but your daughter's feelings and psychological state is not necessarily politically correct, either. Perhaps she is struggling with resentment toward you for \"taking her mother away from her\" or something similar. Your transition isn't merely affecting your life, but it affects hers, too. She has friends and school mates who all have mothers. Perhaps she is struggling with the fact that she doesn't. She should be allowed space to process this, and grow at her own pace. It's probably very embarrassing for her. What she needs is a MOTHER to help her through this life crisis... but she doesn't have a mother, so cut her some slack. It's all painful and confusing for her. She's being forced to deal with life decisions you've made for yourself... that also directly affect her, and it's not fair.
