We both work full time. in my fifties, and she's in her late forties. This is her third marriage and my first.  I make about $90K a year, and she makes about $40K. We should be very comfortable, but our finances are tight every month.\n\nWhen I was single, money was never a problem. I've never managed my finances closely, but I didn't really have to: if I felt like I was spending too much, I'd just stop spending for a while, and it worked fine: I consistently saved money. My wife's spending habits are very different: if we have money in our accounts, she'll spend it. Since we were married, we've spent down our (my) savings to essentially zero, and currently owe several thousand dollars to the IRS. I have taken a part-time job, on top of a very demanding full-time job, in order to make ends meet.\n\nToday, I accidentally opened a piece of my wife's mail and discovered that she has been secretly using a credit card. She's had the card since before we were married. I knew she still had it, but she agreed several years ago to stop using it. She refused at first (she said she didn't want me to know what she was spending money on) but she ultimately agreed that it would just be for emergencies.\n\nBefore I was able to see the balance on the statement I'd opened, she snatched it out of my hand, walked away, and refused to talk to me about it. When I asked what she'd been using the card for, she became very angry, told me she \"wasn't prepared to talk about it\" and accused me of \"cornering her.\"\n\nWe are on a path to serious financial trouble. I am willing to cooperate with her on a formal budget, but I don't have high hopes it would work: we tried a few years back and she just disregarded it and spent $300 outside of the budget the first month. If the budget doesn't work, I'm inclined to set up my own accounts and separate our money: we'd split our income 50-50 every month, and each pay half of our shared expenses (mortgage, utilities, insurance, etc.). Each of us would be able to spend/save the balance in our respective accounts.\n\nTo be honest, this feels like the first step in divorce, which it may be. This is not the only point of serious friction in our relationship.\n\nTLDR: My wife spends money indiscriminately and I've just discovered she is secretly accruing debt. AITA for wanting to separate our finances so I can control half the money I earn?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But even when you very sensibly separate your finances, the only way for you not to be responsible for her irresponsible spending habits and increasing debt might be a divorce.  Talk with your lawyer about the laws in your country/state/province, but I don't think there's any other way to avoid joint responsibility for a spouse's debts.  Assuming you might wish to retire someday, if you stay with her, you need a financial counselor, complete transparency about where her money goes, a written budget, and a maybe an ultimatum or two.", "I think even if you separate your finances that won't solve the problem entirely. She'll keep overspending and won't have enough to pay her portion of the bills. And since you're married her debts already affect you. You're not financially compatible. Maybe a financial advisor could help her understand how much damage she's causing. NTA", "NTA. Let's just cut straight to the part where you divorce her because this type of behaviour isn't just a fad. It's clearly been going on a long, long time. Long enough that you should have a cracking view of all those red flags and the two previously failed marriages. Budgeting poorly isn't an AH move. Having a secret credit card, after explicitly stating she would get rid of it alone is ground for a separation due to the betrayal of trust. Add in demolishing your savings with her spending? Talk to a lawyer and make sure her debts are viewed as a marital obligation", "INFO: Did you ever go over finances before marriage? In detail?", "NTA\n\nSet up your own account. Only use the joint account for bills, with no savings account attached to it. I would speak to a financial advisor and a lawyer as well, to make sure that your money is protected. I knew a couple in a similar situation, and her husband found out she had forged his signature on a loan, since she couldn't stop spending. After that, he made sure that he was not responsible for debts she racked up, and all of her private bills were paid out of her account alone. Good luck.", "NTA for wanting to separate but also a caveat -- she makes considerably less than you so splitting expenses isn't exactly equitable and puts a greater financial strain on her. Also consider who does the housework and account for how that is split. This has worked really well for my spouse and I - we account for housework at 1.5x the minimum wage because that is the absolute least we'd pay for a cleaner, and then we split bills (though instead of doing a percentage of each, we each take individual bills that would add up to our portion, with the exception of rent which is split 60/40)\n\nAlso, there are debtors anonymous groups. I have no experience with it other than seeing the sign on my way to work so I can't say if it's helpful but it does  exist if that's something she might be open to.", "NTA.
