Now, since you probably would like to keep the peace, perhaps you can offer an alternative way for your step-father to participate. Will you have dancing at your reception? Perhaps you could dance with him first (after the \\*first\\* dance with your new hubby). Or perhaps your step-father could give the first toast. Or...? He might not be your heart's choice for those activities, but a peaceful wedding celebration might be worth it. And if you choose to not include your step-father in any special way, you're still NTA.

(Good job seeing things from both sides, BTW. I don't know how old you are, but you're showing maturity there.)  \n\n\nYou might consider, in order to allow everyone to save face, to not have anyone walk you down the aisle. A lot of women choose this because they don't like the implication that they are being given from the father to the husband like a side of beef. That way, you wouldn't be answering people's question about your unorthodox choice all day long. You want your wedding to be about your new relationship, right? And not your struggles with your step dad? It's just human nature. People will be curious about why you are walking with your Uncle instead of the man who was with your mom while you were being raised.   \n\n\nPerhaps there's another way to honor your Uncle's role in your life. It's just a suggestion. I don't know the whole of your situation.

My dad remarried when I was 6.  I have never been close to my stepmom.  I did have her walk down the aisle in my wedding as a \"mom\" along with my mom and husbands mom, but that was more for my dad and siblings than me.  My youngest half-brother walked her down.  He was a little too old to be a good ring bearer but would have been the only sibling not in the wedding, so it gave him a job to do.  But, if the situation was reversed and I had a step dad and not a step mom, I never would have made an accommodation to let someone walk me down the aisle that I didn't really want with me.", "NTA. If anyone walks you down the aisle, it should be someone who means a lot to you.  You could just walk yourself down the aisle even.", "NTA, not by a long shot. Sounds like they're all more concerned with appearances. Not being funny, if they didn't want to look bad, they should have fostered a healthy and loving relationship. The only bone you can throw them all, and *only* if you feel so inclined, is to put emphasis on how truly special your bond with your uncle is, hence the decision for him to walk you rather than stepdad. But I personally wouldn't be that nice. Our eldest son walked me when we finally married, and shitty family weren't welcome to our special day.", "NTA - if you have a wedding program you can write a little note about being close to your uncle and recognize it\u2019s unusual but honors your special bond or something. You can choose to recognize your stepfather there also if you want. To be perfectly blunt - step parents can really cause a lot of damage and I question if anyone should ever marry a second time if they have children in the home. Be in a long term relationship in separate houses until your child goes to college or gets a job. And don\u2019t ever kick the kid out over the stepparents issues. Blended families are a myth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
