You know what I did? I was kind to her and used the opportunity to get to know her. Hating her wasn't going to make anything better. \n\nI get the feelings your kids have but they need to get over it or better yet, address it and work through it.

But, like so many other people, it seems hard to imagine that there isn't a reason, even if it isn't obvious to you.  A widow/er remarrying is a normal thing that generally kids accept, especially of the new spouse comes in after the kids aren't kids any more and doesn't attempt to play a parental role.\n\nSo either there is something you don't know, or your kids have an unusual amount of trauma around this, which then I would wonder why.  Did their father die in an unusually traumatic way?\n\nThat wouldn't change the n t a vote.  I am just curious as to the rest of the story.", "NTA I agree with you that you two are a package deal and you have made it clear what respect looks like behaviorally.

He wasn't outwardly \"bad,\" but he never seemed to want to be around other people or make the effort to get to know my wife or her brother or anyone else. \n\nSo I'm wondering - why don't your kids want to be around your husband? Missing their father is one thing, but it sounds like they got to the point of being okay with your marriage. \n\nThere's an INFO gap between \"they were happy I was happy\" and \"now they just can't deal with Jim at all.\" What happened?", "I would go with NAH.\n\nKids do not have to accept Jim as a member of their family or yours.\n\nYou have the right to not attend a family event like a wedding if it means your SO can't be there.", "NTA.

You love him and if he hasn't done anything to warrant their ire other than love/marry you your kind D's need to grow up and be polite.", "I think you got your wording wrong.  You can't tell one person to RESPECT another.  That would require them to admire his qualities.  That is not something that you can force, and you will lose if you try to do that.  However, you can ask that your children ARE RESPECTFUL  in that this man is someone you care for and is your husband and needs to be treated as such.  Unless there is something you are not disclosing, then Jim should be invited to the wedding as your husband.  He also needs to be respectful, not expecting to participate as a close family member, but just as a guest.", "INFO. Did you actually asked your kids WHY they hate that husband of you? Because they may have a reason for that, a reason you can't see or refuse to see.", "In my opinion, I think NAH . You respected your kids feelings and waited until they weren't at home any longer to even think about dating. I get they miss their dad but they are grown adults and need to start acting like it. They are disrespecting you as well and honestly, I'd want my partner to move on and be happy if I passed away, yeah sure I'd want them to find someone who would love and respect our kids but I'd also hope ny kids would respect their dad and the new partner as well\n\nEdit to add. However as people have said Is there a reason they don't want him involved have you actually asked them calmly and heard them out properly.\n\nThinking more on it. The most you can expect from them is civility. In regards to the wedding you may have to compromise and go without husband or you're going to be telling your kids that your husband is more important than them.", "NTA.

They are adults and you really can\u2019t tell them who they have to respect and who they don\u2019t.\n\nYou wanting your husband to be accept is normal but pushing him down your children throats is not going to help the situation. The fact you brought him to other event and him not being invited is probably how we got here. \n\nThe thing is if you keep on the path your on you will loose the children. If you insist on your husband being at this wedding may very well end up with you not getting invited. If your ok with that then let this be the hill you die on. But if you want to continue to have a relationship with your kids you need to put in some work. Telling adults to accept it or else usually doesn\u2019t end well .", "INFO; why don\u2019t they like Jim? How much time did they spend with him before you got married?", "NTA. Your kids suffered a terrible loss and of course no one can replace their dad. You sound like you were a good mother to them during this hard time and didn't even date to spare their feelings. However, they seem to have learned that your feelings and needs don't matter. You are MARRIED to this man and they need to grow the F up. From what you've said he's not been mean to them or told them he's their replacement dad or anything that would cause them to act so cruel. \n\nMaybe you should have dated while they were younger so they'd get over it by now because they are being selfish brats.", "NAH\n\nYou are factually wrong - they are adults and you cannot make them do anything. You and your kids both have to decide what having a good relationship is worth to you.", "If there's nothing else going on, gotta say NTA. It's weird to me that your kids hate Jim so much given the ages they were when you married, and that may indicate something else is going on, but without further evidence, the kids are out of line here. \n\nTo everyone saying respect is earned: from what is described, Jim has been polite, respectful, and good to OP. Respect to the point of tolerance at family events, HAS been earned.", "I think there's more to this story, but until we get some random edits, I'm going to go against a lot of answers here and say...\n\nYTA.\n\nWhy? Because you can't/don't just demand respect. It doesn't work like that. It's mad to think someone gets automatic respect simply because they married you.\n\nPerhaps you could've worded it as \"respect my decision of partner\".\n\nBut i still think there's more to this, because how odd for grown up children to act this way.", "Info: are you willing to lose your relationship with your children over Jim being included? While I do think they are being rude, It sounds like you\u2019ve continuously brought Jim to events where he isn\u2019t welcome or wanted. That can\u2019t have been fun for anyone. By saying you and Jim are a package deal, they may choose to not invite either of you to things. Is this something you\u2019re okay with?", "NTA. \n\nI would feel differently about this if you had either married Jim not long after your first husband passed OR if Jim was the last/latest in a revolving door of men that you introduced to your kids in the years between your husband passing and you marrying Jim. \n\nBut you didn't do either of those things, and in fact seem to have gone out of your way to slow-roll this relationship to try and make your kids comfortable. However, they seem to want to accept no other outcome than you by yourself in perpetual mourning for their father for the rest of your life, and that's not at all acceptable nor reasonable. \n\nAs is said all the time on this sub, a person is free to NOT invite whoever they want to the wedding. But then they have to accept the consequences of that choice - so people who do childfree weddings need to accept that some people with kids can't/won't come if their kids aren't invited, and people who only invite one half of a married couple also need to accept that the other spouse may not come. \n\nI think you're going to have a lot of people on here judge you to be the asshole in this situation if you don't go to the wedding since it's your child. But I think - in this specific situation - it's a battle worth fighting. If you cave into this, I can promise you that your younger two kids will follow suit and only invite you to their weddings, and this will be taken as the precedent to not include Jim from here on out. \n\nIt's a shame that your kids are acting this way, and I hope they come around.", "NTA, you was respectful of their father while they lived with you by not dating etc, its not fair of them to expect you to be a spinster forever more.", "NTA stand your ground.", "YTA, and you aren't telling us something.

They do not owe him an invite to any of their life events. It may be awkward for you, but you need to accept that your children don't consider Jim to be family and want nothing to do with him.\n\nI really hope you haven't tried to force Jim into your children's life events. That would be a major issue that most everyone would react negatively towards.\n\nFrom reading your OP, it sounds like you have done this.

He is not their father and your attitude is you saying \"he's your dad now\". It sounds like they're happy your happy, but you must respect the \"don't want him here\". Because it could be hurtful to them, it could bring up some trauma that wasn't dealt with when they were kids. \n\nAll that being said, you have 0 right to demand their respect to a person they don't know and don't wish to know.", "YTA.
