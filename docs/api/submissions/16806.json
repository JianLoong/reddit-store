However as people have said Is there a reason they don't want him involved have you actually asked them calmly and heard them out properly.\n\nThinking more on it.

However, they seem to want to accept no other outcome than you by yourself in perpetual mourning for their father for the rest of your life, and that's not at all acceptable nor reasonable. \n\nAs is said all the time on this sub, a person is free to NOT invite whoever they want to the wedding. But then they have to accept the consequences of that choice - so people who do childfree weddings need to accept that some people with kids can't/won't come if their kids aren't invited, and people who only invite one half of a married couple also need to accept that the other spouse may not come. \n\nI think you're going to have a lot of people on here judge you to be the asshole in this situation if you don't go to the wedding since it's your child. But I think - in this specific situation - it's a battle worth fighting. If you cave into this, I can promise you that your younger two kids will follow suit and only invite you to their weddings, and this will be taken as the precedent to not include Jim from here on out. \n\nIt's a shame that your kids are acting this way, and I hope they come around.", "NTA, you was respectful of their father while they lived with you by not dating etc, its not fair of them to expect you to be a spinster forever more.", "NTA stand your ground.", "YTA, and you aren't telling us something.

He is not their father and your attitude is you saying \"he's your dad now\". It sounds like they're happy your happy, but you must respect the \"don't want him here\".

OP, can you please elaborate?", "NAH. You're all in a rough spot, and a little more understanding would go a long way.\n\nYou're not wrong to ask your kids to treat the new spouse with basic courtesy, but demanding \"respect\" is probably too much.\n\nThe fact is that adult children whose parent remarries can feel intense resentment toward someone they see as replacing their other parent, *especially* if they don't feel like those feelings are validated by their surviving parent. They don't know where those feelings come from, or understand them, and without intentional effort, they aren't likely to get past them on their own.\n\nThey're kind of being jerks, but they also have a (sort-of not very good, given they're adults and should act like it) excuse.\n\nWhat y'all need is family therapy, for them to get past their issues and you to better understand what's going on below the surface. The last thing you want to do is get all judgy and start making demands though - that's only going to further sour the situation.\n\nBecause what can happen if you just keep pushing on your pov is that you can all end up estranged.

Racist, histrionic, self-obsessed, controlling, jealous, unreasonable. Every word out of her mouth was either screaming or shrieking. Screaming at waiters, screaming at people on speakerphone in the middle of a restaurant. Her whole life was a series of catastrophes of her own making, and my dad would have to pick up the pieces. She was offensive in almost every possible way a person can be offensive, but my siblings and I all kept giving her a chance for the sake of my dad. For YEARS. \n\nAfter about 5 years I'd had enough. I told my father I was happy to have a relationship with him but I could not stand to be around her anymore. My siblings came to similar conclusions. My father wasn't okay with this. He tried to do the \"we are a package deal\" thing and wouldn't attend anything unless she was invited. She wouldn't let him out of the house past dinnertime, so he would occasionally try to steal away and get lunch with us on occasion.

That will never change. Explain that if YOU had been the one who died, you would have wanted your husband to find someone to love him and be happy. That future love would not diminish what you experienced. Then express how grateful you are that you have found someone who can share your life and can love you while understanding and respecting how much you will always love and miss your former husband.

Then tell them that while you understand where they are coming from, their attitudes and actions are unfair to you AND to their father who would absolutely have wanted you to be happy and who presumably raised his children better than they are behaving. They will never have a father/children relationship with Jim, and that is okay, but they need to understand that he is a human being with feelings and that they need to treat him with decency. If they cannot do that, you will need to limit your contact with them. Limiting contact is a sign to Jim of how much you love him, but also as a reminder of their father and the good man that he was. You would not be honoring his memory at all if you allowed your children to act this way to someone who had come to help heal their mother's grief. \n\nBest of luck.

Their first instinct might be that you\u2019re replacing their dad, but that doesn\u2019t make it true.\n\nYou can\u2019t force them to love you husband, but you\u2019re absolutely right they should respect him, you and how he means a lot to you. I hope you get a chance to resolved things with your children, but they have to be willing to.", "On the facts presented, NTA.  But I don't think your problem has anything to do with respect for Jim.  Your kids certainly do not have to like or respect your husband, as evidenced by their current and longstanding behaviors.\n\nIt seems to me that all of this feedback demonstrates a remarkable lack of respect for you.  You decided to marry Jim, Jim is automatically your plus one.  If one of your kids married an AH, you would still invite that AH to holiday dinner.  Why doesn't it work the other way?  \n\nSomething is missing in this story, perhaps their father was a jerk who ran you down all the time?  Good luck in any case.", "NTA. It\u2019s incredibly selfish that your adult children would expect you to remain single forever. You\u2019re not asking them to respect him as their father but to respect him as your partner. That\u2019s perfectly alright. I lost my father when I was 8. My mother started dating again when I was 16/17. She has every right to move on as do you. You\u2019re an individual in your own right. I\u2019m sorry but your children are being AHs.", "NTA - This wouldn\u2019t be the first grown ass adult I\u2019ve known that can\u2019t get past a parent moving on after their spouse passed.

You can\u2019t replace someone who\u2019s dead. \n\nGet all 3 of them together and ask them to give a real explanation.  Not this crap that you\u2019ve replaced their Dad. Because if that\u2019s the only reason they can come up with, ask them if they think you should have just joined a nunnery and why they think you don\u2019t deserved to be loved by someone anymore.", "NTA. So many of the comments are bending over backwards to read into why the kids don't accept him, assuming there is part of the story we are missing or legit reason why OPs kids dont like Jim. \n\nThe fact that OP came to reddit to actually ask others opinion of the situation, I am going to have to assume she is giving it at face value. She said herself their bio dad was a great father. If I were to speculate, it seems plausible and probable that their mother being with someone else's is just another big change on top of the original change, which was losing their dad unexpectedly at important development time (young adulthood). I'm not going to assume Jim is some jerk or that the kids are assholes either, who expect mom to die alone to protect their fragile feelings. People like the status quo and will resist adapting, when they don't want to. OP standing firm seems like the rational thing to do..", "Nta. \n\n\n\n\nMy Nan tried to move on after my Papa died.

Your kids do not want a connection with him, they don't want a relationship with him and that's ok.  And NO, they DO NOT have to respect him just because he exists on planet earth.  Respect is earned and is not granted just becuase you waved your magic wand and wished for it.  You have a choice to make now, be in your kids lives \"without\" your husband being present or NOT be in your kids lives because your new husband isn't welcome.  Make your choice.

You say for they don\u2019t like him for no reason, but there is a reason and you need to ask them. Until someone can provide a sincere reason why he has been uninvited, they need to respect him. If something needs to be addressed, that\u2019s on them to tell you and you to hopefully be kind about it. They could actually be mad at you, not him.", "You absolutely are allowed to say that if they don't want him there that you won't attend.

It was fine to read into their actions and guess their thoughts when they were kids. But now they are adult individuals who are not you. All you can know is what they communicate to you.\n\nE.g. I'll ask specifically: what were the list of tangible issues your kids told you were the reason they did not want him at your oldest's wedding? Kid 1 said they didn't want him there because ____, kid 2 said they didn't want him there because ____, kid 3 said they didn't want him there because ____.", "NTA. You put your love life on hold for your childrens' comfort. The last they can do is accept that you've fallen in love again and respect your relationship. I do see some AH in the comments.

I'm sorry you lost your husband, and your kids their Dad. That's an incredibly rough journey to take. This all must be heartbreaking for you. It sounds like you have done everything \"right\", i.e., waiting until they all left home before seeking a new partner. But they still think you're replacing their dad.  It's all grief. Maybe they can't express their inner conflict about feeling like if they are nice to Jim, they're betraying their dad. And they feel like, if they are still feeling his loss, why aren't you? And they don't want a replacement dad, so how can you want a replacement husband yet? Not rational feelings; but grief rarely is. \n\n I don't think you need to convince them to like Jim, because it's not Jim himself that is the problem - is the concept of him in your and their lives. I'm probably not telling you anything you don't already know, but family grief counselling might be helpful. I hope you can find some peace with all this. I personally would go to the wedding with or without Jim, I don't think I'd want \"missed their wedding\" as part of our story.  And I know that would hurt Jim. Nobody wins, really. I think 'our own kids/YOUR kids'  is probably the number one argument topic in second marriages.  I don't know the solution, it's just human nature I think.", "They aren't seeing you as a person.
