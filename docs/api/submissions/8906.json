Half of the people there seemed like total douches, but my friends were physically forcing me to stay and play the stupid games they were doing.

Once we got in the closet, she kind of backed off into a corner, and I told her that it was okay-- we didn't have to do anything handsy and we could just lie to the others pretend we did once we got out. She looked at me kind of shocked, and then just nodded and sat in the corner.\n\nThis morning, a bunch of her friends were messaging me on Instagram and SnapChat telling me that I was an extreme asshole for not being handsy with her and making her feel undesirable.

Sure, you could have asked her but, did you want to touch and be touched by her?", "Lmao who plays 7 mins in heaven in their 20s \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA", "NTA, I guess, but why are you hanging out with a bunch of grown-ass adults who still play seven minutes in heaven at parties", "NTA- if anything, you were probably the most respectful guy there. But who still plays 7 minutes of heaven in their 20s? lol", "NTA. You were trying to be respectful. You could argue that she was consenting by going into the closet with you, but that's a risky assumption if she's being similarly pressured by her friends.\n\nThe ideal would have been to instead ask first. \"Are you okay with doing this?\" or \"do you feel comfortable with this?\" instead of making the assumption. But what YOU want matters, too, and it sounds like you didn't want to participate. And what you said is way nicer in that scenario than just outrightly rejecting her.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. Her friends are the real problem here. If I were this girl, I'd be mortified that they'd spoken to you about it. If you want a recommended course of action, I would get in touch with her and explain that you didn't want her to feel pressured and misunderstood her body language. Maybe get coffee and have a laugh about it if you can.", "NTA. You did exactly the right thing. You should look back on this and feel proud of yourself for being such a gentleman. A lot of young men your age would have been anything but. She\u2019s being very immature, but I\u2019d just shake it off. It\u2019ll blow over and the gossip will move on to its next victim.", "Shake it off pimp you did well. Risk of sexual assault aside if you were not comfortable and she may have been uncomfortable her friends are just being \u201cmean girls\u201d because that\u2019s what dumb college chicks do. NTA, you\u2019ll be in a new world in a week or two seriously don\u2019t worry too much. I\u2019ve noticed social pressures cause young men too not be true to them selfs and that ends bad.", "NTA but also I can see why she might be destroyed by the experience. As a child of the 80\u2019s, 7 minutes in heaven was something we always read about as kids in random juvenile fiction but I\u2019ve never heard someone actually doing it in real life. Always seemed like a great fantasy, brad/chad/shad/lad takes you into a closet and then suddenly it\u2019s some John Hughes movie. Back then I would have died inside if my crush got me for 7 minutes in heaven but then decided to tell me we\u2019re cool not to touch. That said, I also cared way too much about who picked me during heads up 7-up and was married by senior year so maybe it\u2019s a me problem.", "NTA - I think people forget that you have to consent too? Like they can\u2019t just demand you touch a girl to make her feel desirable like it\u2019s not a you problem. And if she did have an interest she could have made a move and then you decide on what to do. What you did was very respectful and was also your choice. No one can or should ever force you do get handsy with random people. The girls are just yikes.", "NTA - you\u2019re actually a decent human being. This girl had a crush on you and was hurt because you weren\u2019t treating her like an object. You sound like a great human to me.", "NTA, you did the right thing. \n\nShe could have say something to you if she was expecting something to happen", "NTA\n\nYour immediate actions were to be considerate of her feelings. If you make thinking about how the other person will feel the way you handle *everything*, there aren't many situations in life where you'll go wrong.\n\nDon't listen to your friends, OP. You did the classy thing.", "She looked and seemed like she didn't want to be touched. Based on your comments you didn't want to be touched by anyone that night. Ignore them. I'm fact block them. If they ask in person tell them that you're not a r**ist and you're not going be handsy with someone who seemed scared and like they didn't want it. That should shut em up. It's not your responsibility to make some random girl feel desirable. Big NTA.", "She should be grateful you were a gentleman. That is some one you want to get to know. You respected her.", "OP you done the right thing by respecting her as she did not say yes or consent and therefore you are NTA", "NTA She didn't show signs of consent so all you did was express you didn't intend to SA her. Plus consent goes both ways. Even if you actually just weren't into her then you still WNBTA because again 2 people have to willingly agree to it for it to be ok. \n\nIf you want to get to know her then ask her on the date. If not then just tell people she looked uncomfortable and you didn't want her to feel forced into something because of peer pressure, because SA is NOT OK.", "NTA. Being put in a situation like that, especially in this day and age with people getting into trouble over things they supposedly did or didn't do to another person...(not every PERSON should be believed) you should be grateful that she admitted you didn't do anything. If I were you though, I would reach out to her and tell her that the reason you kept your hands to yourself was \"out of respect\", that you didn't feel comfortable with being overly familiar with her physically without her express consent, especially since you didn't know her very well, and if  you're interested in her, tell her as well that you're just not the type of person that jumps into things like that without getting to know them first, and that you would like to get to know her more.", "NTA. They\u2019re the assholes for calling you out. Maybe reach out to the girl and explain what happened. Maybe ask her out if you\u2019re interested", "NTA.  Sounds like a dumb game to me, one that could cause alsorts of confusion and potential for sexual assault.", "NTA\n\nYou seem very kind and respectful. I saw another comment that you mention you cleared it up with her. You respect her, communicate well, and are focused on school. I say continue your path and leave these friends behind. \n\nChange is hard, and so is making friends. Unfortunately, it gets exponentially harder the older you get, but you're still at an age and in a place to find a new group of people whose ideals and morals are closer to what you want to do, and less in line with B movies from the 80s. \n\nGood luck!", "Nta.  What was the party called? A Red Flag party? Super weird.  So now you're a a-hole for not SA-ing a stranger at a party? I'm assuming you're incredibly good looking,  because if you were mildly unpleasant looking or too short you'd be a creep in their texts.", "Sorry but I\u2019m not buying that was happening at an adult party.", "NTA you thought she was scared & uncomfortable,  people are forgetting due to her backing away from you. So you tried to reassure here, you were clearly brought up properly. And one thing people are forgetting, what if YOU just didn\u2019t want to get handsy with her. Doesn\u2019t what you want matter?!?!", "This sounds like an old movie I watched a couple years ago.  Anyway, if true NAH.", "INFO: \n\nWhat 20 somethings play a game that jr high kids play?\n\nHow did your friends physically force you to stay at a party? Were you tied up or handcuffed?", "ESH.
