My husband and I are ecstatic but anxious--I have pretty severe endometriosis and have already had 3 miscarriages. When we found out I was pregnant again we didn't tell anyone, not even our parents, for the first 3.5 months. This is actually pretty standard for the Ashkenazic community, as it's traditional not to inform anyone but close family and friends until around 5 months. It's also traditional not to have a baby shower.\n\nOne of my close friends, \"Eliza\" (31F), isn't Jewish. This has never been an issue between us up until now. There were a few insensitive comments here and there, but she always apologized afterwards. Recently, though, she's been making more and more rude comments about my Judaism, especially since I told her I was going to be applying to rabbinical school after the baby was born.\n\nWhen I told all my friends, including Eliza, about my pregnancy, I made it very clear many times that I did not want a baby shower. I informed them that it wasn't my family's tradition, that in Ashkenazic culture it's considered bad luck, and that given my history (as well as my husband's--his mom died due to complications during her pregnancy with my SIL) I really needed this sense of security. So, when Eliza invited us over for Sunday brunch, I didn't think anything of it.\n\nWhen we got there, her house was decked out in pink and blue and there were all these signs saying \"OP's Baby Shower\" hanging in her living room. About half of our friends were there and they all started cheering, congratulating us, and pointing at all these presents they bought us. I immediately started crying, which I know was kind of dramatic. I just felt really disrespected and overwhelmed, and obviously my hormones are a little out of whack. I turned around and walked straight out of the house and sat crying in my husband's car while he chewed out our friends for not respecting my wishes and Eliza for inviting us over under false pretenses. He came out about 5 minutes after me and drove us home, also crying.\n\nEliza and the other friends at the baby shower have been texting me non-stop ever since calling me ungrateful and overdramatic. Eliza in particular sent me walls of texts telling me that just because I'm Jewish doesn't mean I get to spit in the face of all she put together for me or decide how she wants to celebrate. But my husband is saying that I have every right to feel upset and that all of our friends, including Eliza, knew this wasn't something I wanted.\n\nI know that in American culture baby showers are a fun way to help out new moms. But I'm already so stressed out about this pregnancy that relying on my family's traditions around pregnancy has been really comforting. My husband has also appreciated keeping to these traditions. . I feel like Eliza should have respected our wishes and the motivations behind them, but I also know that a lot of work and love went into planning that shower and I hate that I made my friends feel unappreciated and like I don't value them because we don't share a religion. So. AITA?\n\nEdit: I realized I didn't explain why I was at Eliza's house. She invited my husband and I over last Sunday for brunch but it was actually a surprise baby shower.", "created_utc": 1675576558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u5ajt/aita_for_walking_out_of_the_baby_shower_my/", "score": 6386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rubbing your face in how your traditions and feelings are worthless appears to be really important to her.

That doesn't seem to show a full appreciation to the extent to which she stomped all over your culture and emotional needs at a particularly vulnerable time. Cutting off the friendship completely does seem a more appropriate response.\n\nThis has nothing to do with not sharing a religion.

Also, OP might not even want a pulpit. She might want to be a chaplain or a teacher or the executive director of a Hillel.

You very clearly stated multiple times that you did not want a baby shower.

They intentionally went behind your back about it and they intentionally lied about what the event was because they KNEW you'd tell them no and they couldn't have that. They hoped you would feel bad enough that they spent the time and money to put it together and stay. You had every right to cry! You were majorly disrespected, your sense of safety stripped, and they added unnecessary stress to you and the baby. All because that's what THEY wanted. She said that you were spitting in her face about how SHE wanted to celebrate. She doesn't get a right to celebrate your pregnancy or your baby how she wants. She can wait until she's pregnant for that and if she can't, then good! She'd just teach her kid that it's ok to disrespect other people's religions, cultures, and traditions. She was intentionally insulting you every single time she made a comment. If she can't accept that you don't want a baby shower and you clearly explained why, even though you didn't have to, then to throw one anyway was an intentional disrespect and an intentional insult to you and your religion, wishes, culture, and tradition. Now they're disrespecting you by insulting you for not staying for a shower they knew you didn't want and didn't care that you didn't want it because they did! All your \"friends\" who were at the shower are not your friends. They don't care about your wants, and they don't care about you. They only care about themselves.

The wife really liked the social aspect of it (so did the husband) but explained that she could not bring anything home for the baby until it was born. So, we asked if we could throw her a \"mock\" shower. They were both ok with this. We did not play any baby games. We did have deciroations, but we made it more of a celebration of the new journey the couple was getting ready to embark on.. All of us coworkers bought gifts for them, but we did not give the gifts to them. We stored them in a closet at work. We took pictures of the gifts and wrapped the pictures for her to open, just so they could plan what stuff they would still need.

Sephardic Jews, who are the descendants of Diasporic Jews who settled in Iberia and North Africa, do not have this tradition. \n\nMany *Ashkenazim* avoid baby showers (and even avoid purchasing clothes or furniture for the baby before the baby is born) out of fear that making a big (or even medium-sized) fuss about an unborn baby might cause something bad to happen to the baby or the gestational parent. This superstition stems from the rabbinic notion of the evil eye, or the *ayin harah*. There is an idea that a person with *ayin harah* is incapable of being happy for other people and gets angry when good fortune befalls others. In that moment, their gaze is considered dangerous and might bring misfortune. Because throughout history, there was always someone wishing misfortune on the Jewish communities of Europe, we developed a cultural tradition of not bringing too much attention to good things before they happened so as not to provoke the *ayin harah*. It is for this reason why it is customary not to say *mazel tov!* (congratulations) when you hear someone is pregnant, but *b'sha'ah tovah*, which instead wishes that the baby will come at a good and auspicious time.\n\nThese superstitions have nothing to do with Jewish law and everything to do with the history of persecution Ashkenazi Jews suffered. I don't actually believe that misfortune will befall me if someone looks at me wrong. But I do feel uncomfortable with the idea, and since it's not a part of my culture, I felt no desire to do something that I knew would stress me out and make me second guess myself. \n\nThanks for asking such a thoughtful question and for the well wishes!", "This is one of the most heartwarming things I've read - what a wonderful group of coworker friends.", "Or it\u2019s very early\u2026.

She may even have deluded herself into thinking she really WAS doing you a favor because many of these kinds of people will surround themselves with any false narrative that makes them feel good about their actions, which most know at some level is wrong and they want to feel absolved. \"Well it's not bad luck if I plan it\", \"She will change her mind and feel like she missed out if I don't\", \"Americans do this and she's American so it's okay\", \"Superstition isn't real and that means it's 'harmless'\", \"Every woman deserves a baby shower\", etc.\n\nThat kind of thing. I'd say, if you aren't super duper best friends with her, cut her out and move on.

Sigh.", "Exactly! I had people judging me because I waited to tell everyone till my 4-month mark. Then I told them I didn't want to do a baby shower during the height of covid because it would be risky with my immune system and the state it was in. Afterwards when the baby was born everyone wanted to come over and even then I didn't understand the point having a baby shower; just send the things and we can do a video chat party.", "I have her feline brother! My fat cat Daniel is always the first one to demand food. \ud83d\ude02", "In my Muslim Eastern European village, babies have a clove of garlic safety pinned into their clothing to keep evil away.", "\u201cI can\u2019t be racist towards Jews, they\u2019re white and just like us Christians without the Jesus\u201d \n\nHonestly the amount of times I find that people get upset with ethnic minorities who look white because it somehow gives the white person a pass is astounding. This is why Jews often discuss conditional whiteness. We are included in the majority until we aren\u2019t useful any more then all bets are off and afterwards we are gaslit by being told \u201cyou\u2019re white, don\u2019t complain\u201d \n\nThese women are actively being antagonistic and harmful and are blaming OP for ruining things for them when they are actively violating her boundaries.", "Your family sound amazing.", " But you can do both. Some people (like this Eliza) don\u2019t bother.", "I am so sorry you and other Jewish people are treated this way.  You definitely deserve to complain about how you are treated and we definitely should pay attention.  If we don't then history could and will repeat itself.", "Oh there's a few of them. \n\nLeaped vs. leapt    \nWeeped vs. wept   \nCreeped vs. crept\n\nMy English teacher said that these verbs are in the process of being normalized. Normalization makes for some interesting irregularities. For example, \"meant\" vs. \"meaned.\" Normally the past tense of mean is meant. But would you see an issue with, \"She asked him what he meaned\"?", "I agree, it\u2019s not their job, but if someone is genuinely interested, it\u2019s nice to share your knowledge/experiences. It\u2019s much more meaningful (for me, anyway) to get info from a person than Wikipedia or a YouTube video.", "I have Welsh and Scottish friends same! And aside from the bad luck side a lot of people like the focus on the pregnancy, bond as parents (if you are coupled!) and prepare any siblings and don\u2019t run away with fanciful notions imagining a baby and birth and head in the clouds. Be in the present. Just treat it as part of life. Not everyday is special non pregnant either. It seems a good attitude to normalising pregnancy not detaching with games etc.", "Haha, none of the baby names either of us pre-picked survived contact with the other! It was a classic \"Ew, that's my ex's name... Ew, that was the name of a bully at my school...\" etc., etc. It was a sweet but lengthy bonding activity to find *any* names that both of us liked!", "Lol, my dog did the same. Even though I let him out before bed, he decided 3-4 am is the next bathroom time. Then it spread, so now him, my other dog & myself all need to visit the bathroom around that time. It sucks.", "My parents put a name on the birth certificate for me and my late sister. For me, they told family what my English name was, because I was the first male grandchild on both sides. My late sister's name remained a secret until her Simchat Bat. As I said, my brother's was unintentional - they were just undecided until several days later. \n\nWhen my youngest brother was born, they put a name on the birth certificate that we, and he, wound up never using. We always used his Hebrew name - so when he was 9 or 10, they officially changed it to the Hebrew."]}
