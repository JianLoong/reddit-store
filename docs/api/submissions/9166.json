{"id": 9166, "submission_id": "10u5ajt", "title": "AITA for walking out of the baby shower my friends planned for me?", "selftext": "I (28F) am 7 months pregnant. My husband and I are ecstatic but anxious--I have pretty severe endometriosis and have already had 3 miscarriages. When we found out I was pregnant again we didn't tell anyone, not even our parents, for the first 3.5 months. This is actually pretty standard for the Ashkenazic community, as it's traditional not to inform anyone but close family and friends until around 5 months. It's also traditional not to have a baby shower.\n\nOne of my close friends, \"Eliza\" (31F), isn't Jewish. This has never been an issue between us up until now. There were a few insensitive comments here and there, but she always apologized afterwards. Recently, though, she's been making more and more rude comments about my Judaism, especially since I told her I was going to be applying to rabbinical school after the baby was born.\n\nWhen I told all my friends, including Eliza, about my pregnancy, I made it very clear many times that I did not want a baby shower. I informed them that it wasn't my family's tradition, that in Ashkenazic culture it's considered bad luck, and that given my history (as well as my husband's--his mom died due to complications during her pregnancy with my SIL) I really needed this sense of security. So, when Eliza invited us over for Sunday brunch, I didn't think anything of it.\n\nWhen we got there, her house was decked out in pink and blue and there were all these signs saying \"OP's Baby Shower\" hanging in her living room. About half of our friends were there and they all started cheering, congratulating us, and pointing at all these presents they bought us. I immediately started crying, which I know was kind of dramatic. I just felt really disrespected and overwhelmed, and obviously my hormones are a little out of whack. I turned around and walked straight out of the house and sat crying in my husband's car while he chewed out our friends for not respecting my wishes and Eliza for inviting us over under false pretenses. He came out about 5 minutes after me and drove us home, also crying.\n\nEliza and the other friends at the baby shower have been texting me non-stop ever since calling me ungrateful and overdramatic. Eliza in particular sent me walls of texts telling me that just because I'm Jewish doesn't mean I get to spit in the face of all she put together for me or decide how she wants to celebrate. But my husband is saying that I have every right to feel upset and that all of our friends, including Eliza, knew this wasn't something I wanted.\n\nI know that in American culture baby showers are a fun way to help out new moms. But I'm already so stressed out about this pregnancy that relying on my family's traditions around pregnancy has been really comforting. My husband has also appreciated keeping to these traditions. . I feel like Eliza should have respected our wishes and the motivations behind them, but I also know that a lot of work and love went into planning that shower and I hate that I made my friends feel unappreciated and like I don't value them because we don't share a religion. So. AITA?\n\nEdit: I realized I didn't explain why I was at Eliza's house. She invited my husband and I over last Sunday for brunch but it was actually a surprise baby shower.", "created_utc": 1675576558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u5ajt/aita_for_walking_out_of_the_baby_shower_my/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yet when my first was due, she organized a typical American shower for me before my daughter was born\u2014after all, this was not bad luck for ME.  It might be worth sending a group text/email stating you regret the apparent misunderstanding, but you come from a strong religious and family tradition of not buying  for an expected baby until after its birth; doing so is considered bad luck and actually never done\u2014seeing a shower was overwhelming and brought up distressing memories.

You made your wishes clear, plus have very valid reasons for not wanting a baby shower (although just not wanting one is valid).\nI think it would be reasonable to send some kind of group message to everyone who was there explaining where you were coming from. Don't apologise but do make sure everyone is on the same page. I'd bet that Eliza never passed on any of your reasons for not wanting a shower to the rest of your friends. Personally I'd probably have a dig at Eliza too, saying that you didn't want to have to bring up all the reasons but her disrespect has forced your hand.", "Oh Lovely, I didn\u2019t want one for similar health reasons.

Rubbing your face in how your traditions and feelings are worthless appears to be really important to her. And after she spend all that time and energy being crappy to you, all you could muster up was a quick walk out and a five minute lecture from your husband? That doesn't seem to show a full appreciation to the extent to which she stomped all over your culture and emotional needs at a particularly vulnerable time. Cutting off the friendship completely does seem a more appropriate response.\n\nThis has nothing to do with not sharing a religion.

With friends like these, who needs enemies...", "I mean, as a Jewish educator who works with many rabbis.... rabbis are people? Who are allowed to feel hurt when their friends cross their boundaries? Jewish culture doesn't posit that rabbis are some superhuman conduits to God. They're learned people who have made a commitment to the enrichment of Jewish tradition. Also, OP might not even want a pulpit. She might want to be a chaplain or a teacher or the executive director of a Hillel.

You very clearly stated multiple times that you did not want a baby shower. You said it wasn't something your family did in their tradition and you said it meant bad luck to you because of your culture. It's so disrespectful to try and force you to conform to their idea of a baby shower just being helpful to the mom and a good time. They intentionally went behind your back about it and they intentionally lied about what the event was because they KNEW you'd tell them no and they couldn't have that. They hoped you would feel bad enough that they spent the time and money to put it together and stay. You had every right to cry! You were majorly disrespected, your sense of safety stripped, and they added unnecessary stress to you and the baby. All because that's what THEY wanted. She said that you were spitting in her face about how SHE wanted to celebrate. She doesn't get a right to celebrate your pregnancy or your baby how she wants. She can wait until she's pregnant for that and if she can't, then good! She'd just teach her kid that it's ok to disrespect other people's religions, cultures, and traditions. She was intentionally insulting you every single time she made a comment. If she can't accept that you don't want a baby shower and you clearly explained why, even though you didn't have to, then to throw one anyway was an intentional disrespect and an intentional insult to you and your religion, wishes, culture, and tradition. Now they're disrespecting you by insulting you for not staying for a shower they knew you didn't want and didn't care that you didn't want it because they did! All your \"friends\" who were at the shower are not your friends. They don't care about your wants, and they don't care about you. They only care about themselves.

No words for that one. \n\nEndometriosis sucks. \n\nGood luck with the rest of your pregnancy!", "Not her baby, she doesn't decide how to celebrate anything about it, only you do.\n\nAlso, this is 100% out of disrespect to your religion and traditions, not to mention to you as a person.\n\nI don't know what Eliza's issue with Jews is, but drop her.\n\nMay you have full hands when the time comes.\n\nNTA.", "NTA at all!\n\nYou made it very clear you didn't want a baby shower and she and your other friends then blatantly disrespected your wishes. You shouldn't have even needed to give a reason, but you explained why you would be unhappy with the idea and she went ahead and threw you one anyway. You've not done anything wrong.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy, and all the best.", "NTA!\n\nElisa is! I think she is the one moving the water! \nWhen you are ready to talk to them try to explain little by little (one by one) of your friends again, and if this its not disrespectful to you they can make you another kind of party its called \"Ya llegue\", Im here, its like a baby shower but after ones the little one its at they house", "NTA WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCKITY FUCK\n\n\u201cEliza in particular sent me walls of texts telling me that just because I\u2019m Jewish doesn\u2019t mean I get to spit in the face of all she put together for me or decide how she wants to celebrate.\u201d\n\nE-excuse me did I read that right ? How SHE wants to celebrate ? Does she think it\u2019s her baby ? She have absolutely NO RIGHTS to celebrate and lie to you about YOUR baby, she sounds like a crazy narc person, like what in the actual fuck is this entitlement, you should cut bridge with this person because what the hell, she\u2019s actually acting crazy over YOUR BABY, like she can do what she wants and actually disrespect you and your religion, she\u2019s probably \u201ca bit\u201d antisemitic too ngl", "NTA.  You specifically told them \"NO BABY SHOWER.\"  What do they do throw a baby shower.  That is so disrespectful it's not even funny.  I wouldn't be friends with Eliza after this.  If she is going to do things like this after you said not to; she will do it again and again.", "NTA, you told her exactly how you felt about a baby shower and she chose to ignore it. That's completely on her, not on you. She could have just as easily thrown you and baby a party after birth instead. You had every right to be upset, it shows complete disrespect to you and your feelings.", "My first comment was removed so I'll rephrase: \n\nNTA because:\n1) You told her your boundaries. \n2) Eliza is in the wrong because she disrespected you by breaching said boundaries, not the other way around. \n3) Her entire behavior says that it was never about you, it was about her and everyone that showed up to the party. \n4) A healthy solution would be for them to ask: \"Is it alright if I buy the baby a gift on their first birthday?\" or even \"If you guys need anything like diapers or clothes, let me know when you would like them.\" \n5) Your husband is a legend\ud83d\udc4d\u2728", "Thank you so much for the well wishes and the input! I've been spiraling all week about this, and my husband was finally like, \"babe, if you won't believe me, will you at least believe strangers on the internet?\" and so here we are.\n\nI definitely feel less crazy now, and will seriously consider cutting her and some of her more vocal supporters out of my life, at least until the baby comes.", "Thank you so much for the well wishes. Thankfully, I am a part of a very supportive Jewish community, and my parents, BIL, SIL, and FIL are all coming to stay in town around my due date so that we have that extra support, especially since I'll probably have to be on bed rest for the last couple of weeks.", "Sounds like Eliza has main character syndrome", " your friends cared more about their party than your health and wellbeing, which sucks.", " I think it would be reasonable to send some kind of group message to everyone who was there explaining where you were coming from.", ">I just felt that if something went wrong, I didn\u2019t want the burden of packing and sending that stuff somewhere on top of dealing with whatever emotional issues I\u2019d have to.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought this was a very reasonable and practical side of the Jewish tradition not to set up the baby\u2019s room etc before the baby was born.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I'd personally cut all of them out permanently. They all sound like they knew the shower was bad luck to you and that you didn't want one and didn't care. You deserve to have better friends! This show they put on is their true colors and they're shining bright! They don't care about how you feel, your religion, your culture, or your traditions. That's the opposite of friendship", "I am head of the culture committee at work and asked my pregnant coworker if she wanted a shower or celebration or anything at one of our virtual events. She declined and said she wasn't a fan of all that attention on her. I said sounds good and never mentioned it again.\n\nIt's seriously not that hard to respect someone's wishes. Eliza is the crazy one for feeling so compelled to plan something when she's explicitly told no.", "I don't want to stress you out, because you need to rest and be calm right now.  But your \"friend\" is an antisemite.  She is. And I think you know that.  You need to surround yourself with people who will actually suport you. I wish you all the best with your pregancy.", "I'm genuinely inquiring... what part of the baby shower is bad luck? (That is probably phrased wrong, I'm sorry) I ask because I have friends who were pregnant at the same time I was with my 4th. In their culture, bringing anything into the home for the baby before the baby was born was considered bad luck. We asked if they wanted a baby shower. The wife really liked the social aspect of it (so did the husband) but explained that she could not bring anything home for the baby until it was born. So, we asked if we could throw her a \"mock\" shower. They were both ok with this. We did not play any baby games. We did have deciroations, but we made it more of a celebration of the new journey the couple was getting ready to embark on.. All of us coworkers bought gifts for them, but we did not give the gifts to them. We stored them in a closet at work. We took pictures of the gifts and wrapped the pictures for her to open, just so they could plan what stuff they would still need. When the baby was born, one of us coworkers drove up to the hospital and gave them the car seat we bought and the rest of us delivered the other gifts to their family so that it could be taken into the house after the baby came home. \n\nI have to go with NTA for your situation. I'm sorry that their actions stressed you. I would love to hear more about your culture and the thoughts regarding having a baby shower if you have a minute to type out a response (please know that my curiosity is genuine). I hope the rest of your pregnancy is stress free!", "I\u2019m glad you did this. I can see why you would start to think you\u2019re in the wrong when all your friends are united in their opinions about this, but the majority isn\u2019t always right. It can be so hard to see when you\u2019re in the middle of it. This time you and your husband are right and your friends are all wrong. I hope this helps you put aside your self doubt.", "I\u2019m a white American and am appalled!! Your friend was so far out  of line\u2026I  can barely begin to explain how much I disagree. I totally agree with sharing in a public post/email why you did NOT want a baby shower. Try to not throw \u201cEliza\u201d under the bus. (It would give her ammunition to attack you.) instead focus on your point of view. Caring/rational friends will realize the faux pas and wish to apologize to you. \n\nIt\u2019s totally your choice, but you may want to include a reference to miscarriages, to add justification for a delay. \n\nOne last point\u2026..\u201djust because you are Jewish\u201d should be replied to with \u201cjust because you are American and accustomed to people not respecting religious/family/ethnic traditions\u201d. Those \u201cAmericans\u201d are a minority. There places where that is not the case, but in this case, I think you are correct. \n\nThat sh*t does not convince any American I know. Regardless of who may be in office\u2026 most Americans are decent people who realize we are a nation of immigrants and like others who are new and welcome them. \n\n***hugs and support for whatever you decide. I\u2019m offering an opinion and have no idea of the possible consequences. Just know\u2026.you are not alone or foolish in your choices!! ***", "Just wanted to say NTA 100000%!!! Even if you weren\u2019t Jewish and another culture it\u2019s still extremely disrespectful!! Not just that either but imo rather racist if you tell me especially if she\u2019s being nasty about your culture. It\u2019s like feeding pork to a a Muslim.", "I never once said I think she should turn her feelings off. I just think there are better ways of handling it than storming off and having your husband cuss everyone out. That embarrassing for everyone. Yes, her friend did something bad, but it\u2019s not like she murdered her mom or something.", "Sorry, I accidentally replied to you instead of OP. It's late and my eyes are tired!", "Every major denomination of Judaism in the US offers rabbinic and cantorial ordination to people of all genders except the Orthodox movement! (also, by Conservative I do not mean \"conservative\" as in \"Republican\" but as in the word \"conserve.\" The Conservative movement believes in social justice and egalitarianism, we just also \"conserve\" Jewish traditions like keeping kosher, if that makes sense)", "Not only does the Conservative movement welcome women as rabbis, it also welcomes gay men and lesbians as rabbis. \u201cConservative\u201c may be a somewhat misleading term for people unfamiliar with the various Jewish movements.  \n\n\nOP, so you\u2018re OTD and you\u2019ve got Eliza & co to deal with? You\u2019re really getting it from both sides! (I realize my assumptions about how your family and original community are treating you may be off base.)  I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got a supportive husband and synagogue community!", "She said he *chewed* them out, not cussed them out. Even if he did that intense emotional reaction is entirely valid in a situation involving antisemitism, general disrespect, and extreme amounts of audacity.", "Where did OP say that her husband cussed anyone out? Or that she stormed off? All I read was that she, at 7 months pregnant, walked out of a party she was tricked into that went against a clearly established boundary and her husband, who also has his own trauma and was also disrespected and lied to, called out her friends for their misbehavior. She wasn't at work. She wasn't with congregants. She had no obligation to stay and smile for the comfort of non-Jews. She removed herself from a toxic and antisemitic situation, and she did so with more grace than I'd ever expect from a stressed out pregnant woman faced with that level of disrespect.\n\n(Also, you accrediting what you see as her husband's negative behavior to her and using that as evidence for why she shouldn't be a rabbi reeks of misogyny.)", "My parents were both raised Orthodox but left the movement when I was 7 and my older brother came out as trans. Now my mom reads Torah every Saturday and my dad is the head of the Queer Inclusion committee at their synagogue. The four of us have a grand old time being OTD, and my mom in particular is really pushing for me to become a rabbi to piss off her FIL, lol"]}
