My husband and I are ecstatic but anxious--I have pretty severe endometriosis and have already had 3 miscarriages. When we found out I was pregnant again we didn't tell anyone, not even our parents, for the first 3.5 months. This is actually pretty standard for the Ashkenazic community, as it's traditional not to inform anyone but close family and friends until around 5 months. It's also traditional not to have a baby shower.\n\nOne of my close friends, \"Eliza\" (31F), isn't Jewish. This has never been an issue between us up until now. There were a few insensitive comments here and there, but she always apologized afterwards. Recently, though, she's been making more and more rude comments about my Judaism, especially since I told her I was going to be applying to rabbinical school after the baby was born.\n\nWhen I told all my friends, including Eliza, about my pregnancy, I made it very clear many times that I did not want a baby shower. I informed them that it wasn't my family's tradition, that in Ashkenazic culture it's considered bad luck, and that given my history (as well as my husband's--his mom died due to complications during her pregnancy with my SIL) I really needed this sense of security.\n\nWhen we got there, her house was decked out in pink and blue and there were all these signs saying \"OP's Baby Shower\" hanging in her living room. About half of our friends were there and they all started cheering, congratulating us, and pointing at all these presents they bought us. I immediately started crying, which I know was kind of dramatic. I just felt really disrespected and overwhelmed, and obviously my hormones are a little out of whack. I turned around and walked straight out of the house and sat crying in my husband's car while he chewed out our friends for not respecting my wishes and Eliza for inviting us over under false pretenses. He came out about 5 minutes after me and drove us home, also crying.\n\nEliza and the other friends at the baby shower have been texting me non-stop ever since calling me ungrateful and overdramatic. Eliza in particular sent me walls of texts telling me that just because I'm Jewish doesn't mean I get to spit in the face of all she put together for me or decide how she wants to celebrate. But my husband is saying that I have every right to feel upset and that all of our friends, including Eliza, knew this wasn't something I wanted.\n\nI know that in American culture baby showers are a fun way to help out new moms. But I'm already so stressed out about this pregnancy that relying on my family's traditions around pregnancy has been really comforting. My husband has also appreciated keeping to these traditions. . I feel like Eliza should have respected our wishes and the motivations behind them, but I also know that a lot of work and love went into planning that shower and I hate that I made my friends feel unappreciated and like I don't value them because we don't share a religion.

It's your baby. How she wants to celebrate your baby does not fucking matter, to be honest. \n\nAnd you seem to have very, very graciously explained repeatedly to her that this wasn't what you wanted. You shouldn't have even had to explain why, but you did that, too. \n\nShe's a terrible friend, or, at the very best, a terrible listener. Personally, I'd cut her out. \n\nCongratulations and good luck with your pregnancy. I wish you and your husband the best.", "NTA\n\nShe thinks you should respect who she wants to celebrate YOUR pregnancy. What a ridiculously narcissist statement.\n\nThey've disrespected your culture and your clearly stated wishes.  It doesn't matter how much 'work' she put in. If the work was put into something you explicitly said you didn't want.", "Oh, wow, NTA NTA NTA. You communicated your boundaries, shared why they were in place (which was absolutely not a requirement!!!!), and yet your friends STILL ignored your wishes. You and your husband have enough going on without the added stress of this disrespectful, antisemitic BS. B\u2019sha\u2019ah tovah on your pregnancy. I hope you and your husband have a strong support network outside of these people.", "NTA at all. She is a major one though. She made it about her, to tell you that you don\u2019t get to decide how she celebrates? What the heck, it\u2019s not her baby!! You were very clear on your wishes and she completely disrespected you. And then instead of apologizing continues to berate you. She is not a friend. Neither are the others who should have told Eliza to respect your wishes. I\u2019m so sorry.", "You are NTA. You specifically told them you didn't want one and they went behind your back and threw one for you anyways.", "NTA. Baby showers aren't a part of my culture either. It's disrespectful to your culture and wishes that Eliza went behind your back (even if you're not including the belief of bad luck coming from a baby shower). As someone who's TTC for a number of years, I definitely understand the superstitions coming out.\n\nEliza is TA and any of your friends who are scolding you, write a standard response and send that to them. If they continue to argue the point, just block them. Pregnancy is hard enough without adding petty drama to the mix, and your culture and beliefs deserve as much respect as the next person's (or in this case, Eliza. She can go above and beyond when it's her turn, but please remove her from your life if she's willing to ignore your wishes like this)", "NTA! Holy shit NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for what this \u201cfriend\u201d put you through.", "NTA. As long as you were clear beforehand you didn't want a baby shower, I feel like they overstepped by throwing one for you.", "Nta - you made your wishes known long before the party was planned. You also gave your reasoning (faith and more) instead of a simple not interested which is more than required. She completely disrespect you and your wishes for her own personal desires.", "NTA!!! \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for all you\u2019ve gone through even before this event!! It is your body, your pregnancy, your traditions and your time to celebrate/prepare however you so choose!! You expressed yourself clearly only to be ignored and ridiculed for your own beliefs and choices. To throw the \u201cjust because your Jewish doesn\u2019t mean you get to\u2026\u201d is plain awful and based on that, and her other remarks, anti-Semitic and just bullshit.\n\nIm glad husband helped affirm your boundaries and wishes. Hope you two have a supported and calm time before baby\u2019s arrival.", "NTA.  You have a puzzling friend group\u2014I would expect texts of apology, saying they were unaware of your wishes and traditions and hadn\u2019t wished to upset you.  Years ago I had an Orthodox work friend who explained this custom when her pregnancy became obvious\u2014we had a little gift-giving celebration after her baby was safely home.  Yet when my first was due, she organized a typical American shower for me before my daughter was born\u2014after all, this was not bad luck for ME.  It might be worth sending a group text/email stating you regret the apparent misunderstanding, but you come from a strong religious and family tradition of not buying  for an expected baby until after its birth; doing so is considered bad luck and actually never done\u2014seeing a shower was overwhelming and brought up distressing memories.  You so appreciate the effort and would, after the birth, welcome a (whatever is appropriate in your tradition\u2014home visitation. after-birth shower, etc).  I hope your friend comes to her senses and apologizes.", "This is beyond NTA. That they would follow up to text you and call you ungrateful and completely disregard your beliefs is awful. I hope that you will be able to find comfort with your family and forge friendships with friends that are less selfish and more respectful. Having a new baby can be a lonely time so I\u2019m sorry that your friends went so far in the wrong direction. \n\nIf a person doesn\u2019t eat pork yet their friend, who knows this, spends 3 days making a roast pig feast for their birthday and they refuse to eat it, that person should not spend one moment feeling bad that their friend spent the time or feels unappreciated. That is entirely and completely on them for not respecting you.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Your friend is an AH for not respecting your wishes.", "NTA. \n\nPeople should stop forcing what they think is kindness onto others while going against their wishes and expecting gratitude for return. That is just pure entitlement and self satisfaction. \n\nCongrats on your pregnancy btw. Dont let this get into you. Glad your husband got ur back.", "NTA You made your wishes really very clear. This was very not cool, and more about that \u201cfriend\u201d looking good than caring about you. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA how fucking dare they? Like\u2026 the nerve of them to chastise you, Eliza made it all about herself and disrespects you so deeply? Goodbye. Also this is like\u2026 this is something that once you had told them they easily could have looked up more information about why it was important to you but instead they\u2019re literally making it all about them and what they did instead of supporting you in the way that you have asked during your pregnancy. That isn\u2019t friendship.", "NTA, I am so sorry, that must be so stressful for you. You set a boundary, and your friends cared more about their party than your health and wellbeing, which sucks.", "You are NTA. It is similar in Hindu culture to not tell and while we do have a festival to celebrate in certain subcultures it is only after a good amount of time has passed. Your friend is not a friend.", "These people are not your friends. Sorry OP, that's really horrible to have your wishes and your faith blatantly disrespected like that. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour friends didn\u2019t listen to what you wanted and thought their party was more important than your feelings and traditions. I\u2019d seriously evaluate friendships with those involved/those calling you the asshole here because they do not have your back.", "NTA I had a co-worker who believed it was bad luck or simply taboo to have a shower before the birth of a baby. She was not American and was baby showers in her country were always given after the baby was born. Her wishes as well as yours are to be respected.", "NTA. You made your wishes clear, plus have very valid reasons for not wanting a baby shower (although just not wanting one is valid).\nI think it would be reasonable to send some kind of group message to everyone who was there explaining where you were coming from. Don't apologise but do make sure everyone is on the same page. I'd bet that Eliza never passed on any of your reasons for not wanting a shower to the rest of your friends. Personally I'd probably have a dig at Eliza too, saying that you didn't want to have to bring up all the reasons but her disrespect has forced your hand.", "Oh Lovely, I didn\u2019t want one for similar health reasons. And to me this would have been inviting bad luck too. I am so sorry that you went thru this. I am sad that you were not heard.You are definitely NTA.", "NTA. The selfishness of this \u201cfriend\u201d is beyond believable. I\u2019m sorry that they did this, even though you made your wishes known. \n\nSomething does bother me though. I\u2019m going to be seriously downvoted for this, but I guess I don\u2019t understand why someone who is going to be a rabbi and wants to be the spiritual leader of an entire synagogue would walk out and condone their husband cussing out her \u201cfriends.\u201d That\u2019s a little strange to me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Someone 7 months pregnant? Yeah, no.", "NTA, at all!\n\n\n\nScrew \"American traditions\". My SIL was wholly against a lot of typical American traditions - bridal shower, a big wedding, baby shower, etc - because she hates being the center of attention. Coworkers *still* threw her a small baby shower, which she wasn't thrilled about at all. \n\n\n\nIt comes down to respect. Your desires for no baby showers should have been respected 100%, and not even just because of your faith, but because of your personal wants.\n\n\n\nEliza didn't do anything that required appreciation. Either she respects your religion or she doesn't, and unfortunately she sounds like she doesn't.

Eliza is a major AH for trying to trick you into a baby shower, despite you making it clear about your religious traditions.", "Wow, Eliza really worked hard to disrespect your wishes. Rubbing your face in how your traditions and feelings are worthless appears to be really important to her. And after she spend all that time and energy being crappy to you, all you could muster up was a quick walk out and a five minute lecture from your husband? That doesn't seem to show a full appreciation to the extent to which she stomped all over your culture and emotional needs at a particularly vulnerable time. Cutting off the friendship completely does seem a more appropriate response.\n\nThis has nothing to do with not sharing a religion. It's all about respecting a friend's emotional needs and stated wishes around how they want to approach a monumental life change.

With friends like these, who needs enemies...", "I mean, as a Jewish educator who works with many rabbis.... rabbis are people? Who are allowed to feel hurt when their friends cross their boundaries? Jewish culture doesn't posit that rabbis are some superhuman conduits to God. They're learned people who have made a commitment to the enrichment of Jewish tradition. Also, OP might not even want a pulpit. She might want to be a chaplain or a teacher or the executive director of a Hillel. All jobs that allow the rabbi to have a personal life, emotions, and boundaries. IDK, I guess I don't see why you believe that someone wanting to be a member of the clergy requires that they turn their feelings off.", "TBH I take immense joy in being off the *derech,* lol. I currently work at an incredibly accepting and vibrant Conservative synagogue, so I'm getting a lot of support in pursuing my rabbinate, thankfully", "No worries, if it helps, maybe use what you said in the post as a guide.\n\nExplain to them that baby showers conflict with your beliefs and you'd never force your beliefs on others. Eliza was made aware of this and hosted a party without your consent against your beliefs and, after the many years of struggling, you want to have your pregnancy as per your beliefs without being pressured to accommodate someone whose baby it isn't.\n\nIf these people genuinely wanted to support or uplift you and your growing family, they would understand where you're coming from.\n\nThank you so much, and good luck with your pregnancy journey and little bundle of joy!", "Oh I skimmed that bit. Yeah those friends are the worst. Throw out the whole group and start again.", "That\u2019s great!  Those other places are strictly Orthodox! I didn\u2019t realize conservative congregations allowed female rabbis. Good for them\ud83d\udc4d"]}
