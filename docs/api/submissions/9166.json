{"id": 9166, "submission_id": "10u5ajt", "title": "AITA for walking out of the baby shower my friends planned for me?", "selftext": "I (28F) am 7 months pregnant. My husband and I are ecstatic but anxious--I have pretty severe endometriosis and have already had 3 miscarriages. When we found out I was pregnant again we didn't tell anyone, not even our parents, for the first 3.5 months. This is actually pretty standard for the Ashkenazic community, as it's traditional not to inform anyone but close family and friends until around 5 months. It's also traditional not to have a baby shower.\n\nOne of my close friends, \"Eliza\" (31F), isn't Jewish. This has never been an issue between us up until now. There were a few insensitive comments here and there, but she always apologized afterwards. Recently, though, she's been making more and more rude comments about my Judaism, especially since I told her I was going to be applying to rabbinical school after the baby was born.\n\nWhen I told all my friends, including Eliza, about my pregnancy, I made it very clear many times that I did not want a baby shower. I informed them that it wasn't my family's tradition, that in Ashkenazic culture it's considered bad luck, and that given my history (as well as my husband's--his mom died due to complications during her pregnancy with my SIL) I really needed this sense of security. So, when Eliza invited us over for Sunday brunch, I didn't think anything of it.\n\nWhen we got there, her house was decked out in pink and blue and there were all these signs saying \"OP's Baby Shower\" hanging in her living room. About half of our friends were there and they all started cheering, congratulating us, and pointing at all these presents they bought us. I immediately started crying, which I know was kind of dramatic. I just felt really disrespected and overwhelmed, and obviously my hormones are a little out of whack. I turned around and walked straight out of the house and sat crying in my husband's car while he chewed out our friends for not respecting my wishes and Eliza for inviting us over under false pretenses. He came out about 5 minutes after me and drove us home, also crying.\n\nEliza and the other friends at the baby shower have been texting me non-stop ever since calling me ungrateful and overdramatic. Eliza in particular sent me walls of texts telling me that just because I'm Jewish doesn't mean I get to spit in the face of all she put together for me or decide how she wants to celebrate. But my husband is saying that I have every right to feel upset and that all of our friends, including Eliza, knew this wasn't something I wanted.\n\nI know that in American culture baby showers are a fun way to help out new moms. But I'm already so stressed out about this pregnancy that relying on my family's traditions around pregnancy has been really comforting. My husband has also appreciated keeping to these traditions. . I feel like Eliza should have respected our wishes and the motivations behind them, but I also know that a lot of work and love went into planning that shower and I hate that I made my friends feel unappreciated and like I don't value them because we don't share a religion. So. AITA?\n\nEdit: I realized I didn't explain why I was at Eliza's house. She invited my husband and I over last Sunday for brunch but it was actually a surprise baby shower.", "created_utc": 1675576558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u5ajt/aita_for_walking_out_of_the_baby_shower_my/", "score": 448, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yet when my first was due, she organized a typical American shower for me before my daughter was born\u2014after all, this was not bad luck for ME.  It might be worth sending a group text/email stating you regret the apparent misunderstanding, but you come from a strong religious and family tradition of not buying  for an expected baby until after its birth; doing so is considered bad luck and actually never done\u2014seeing a shower was overwhelming and brought up distressing memories.

You set a boundary, and your friends cared more about their party than your health and wellbeing, which sucks.", "You are NTA.

You made your wishes clear, plus have very valid reasons for not wanting a baby shower (although just not wanting one is valid).\nI think it would be reasonable to send some kind of group message to everyone who was there explaining where you were coming from. Don't apologise but do make sure everyone is on the same page. I'd bet that Eliza never passed on any of your reasons for not wanting a shower to the rest of your friends. Personally I'd probably have a dig at Eliza too, saying that you didn't want to have to bring up all the reasons but her disrespect has forced your hand.", "Oh Lovely, I didn\u2019t want one for similar health reasons.

Rubbing your face in how your traditions and feelings are worthless appears to be really important to her. And after she spend all that time and energy being crappy to you, all you could muster up was a quick walk out and a five minute lecture from your husband? That doesn't seem to show a full appreciation to the extent to which she stomped all over your culture and emotional needs at a particularly vulnerable time. Cutting off the friendship completely does seem a more appropriate response.\n\nThis has nothing to do with not sharing a religion.

With friends like these, who needs enemies...", "I mean, as a Jewish educator who works with many rabbis.... rabbis are people? Who are allowed to feel hurt when their friends cross their boundaries? Jewish culture doesn't posit that rabbis are some superhuman conduits to God. They're learned people who have made a commitment to the enrichment of Jewish tradition. Also, OP might not even want a pulpit. She might want to be a chaplain or a teacher or the executive director of a Hillel.

You very clearly stated multiple times that you did not want a baby shower. You said it wasn't something your family did in their tradition and you said it meant bad luck to you because of your culture. It's so disrespectful to try and force you to conform to their idea of a baby shower just being helpful to the mom and a good time. They intentionally went behind your back about it and they intentionally lied about what the event was because they KNEW you'd tell them no and they couldn't have that. They hoped you would feel bad enough that they spent the time and money to put it together and stay. You had every right to cry! You were majorly disrespected, your sense of safety stripped, and they added unnecessary stress to you and the baby. All because that's what THEY wanted. She said that you were spitting in her face about how SHE wanted to celebrate. She doesn't get a right to celebrate your pregnancy or your baby how she wants. She can wait until she's pregnant for that and if she can't, then good! She'd just teach her kid that it's ok to disrespect other people's religions, cultures, and traditions. She was intentionally insulting you every single time she made a comment. If she can't accept that you don't want a baby shower and you clearly explained why, even though you didn't have to, then to throw one anyway was an intentional disrespect and an intentional insult to you and your religion, wishes, culture, and tradition. Now they're disrespecting you by insulting you for not staying for a shower they knew you didn't want and didn't care that you didn't want it because they did! All your \"friends\" who were at the shower are not your friends. They don't care about your wants, and they don't care about you. They only care about themselves.

The wife really liked the social aspect of it (so did the husband) but explained that she could not bring anything home for the baby until it was born. So, we asked if we could throw her a \"mock\" shower. They were both ok with this. We did not play any baby games. We did have deciroations, but we made it more of a celebration of the new journey the couple was getting ready to embark on.. All of us coworkers bought gifts for them, but we did not give the gifts to them. We stored them in a closet at work. We took pictures of the gifts and wrapped the pictures for her to open, just so they could plan what stuff they would still need.

Cleaned from top to bottom, dishes/laundry/etc, while my mom cooked up some soup, and easily reheated foods to last a few days.\n\nAll she wanted, was no fuss. And limited people at the hospital. My mom went to meet her granddaughter, and to help them get home. While I finished up cooking and cleaning up that too.\n\nThen my SIL wanted a few days just with her, my brother, and their baby, to get to know each other. My dad and I met the baby about a week after. \n\nWe miiiiiiggggghhht have left two presents for the baby and roses for her. My brother said SIL saw the roses, the food, the fully cleaned house, and cried. Hormones. She said something like, this is what respect and family feel like", "Well her friend is definitely controlling and manipulative.  OP says friend's remarks are more recent and I think friend feels like she's losing OP so she belittles anything that they can't share.  The remarks and behaviour are antisemitic because I believe OPs beliefs are seem as a threat by the friend.  I mean the whole baby shower thing was over friend not feeling as though OP was sharing her pregnancy with her.  Friend is toxic and clingy.  Run.", "So the first thing about the whole baby shower thing is that it is very much an Ashkenazi (Diasporic Jews who settled in Eastern Europe) tradition. Sephardic Jews, who are the descendants of Diasporic Jews who settled in Iberia and North Africa, do not have this tradition. \n\nMany *Ashkenazim* avoid baby showers (and even avoid purchasing clothes or furniture for the baby before the baby is born) out of fear that making a big (or even medium-sized) fuss about an unborn baby might cause something bad to happen to the baby or the gestational parent. This superstition stems from the rabbinic notion of the evil eye, or the *ayin harah*. There is an idea that a person with *ayin harah* is incapable of being happy for other people and gets angry when good fortune befalls others. In that moment, their gaze is considered dangerous and might bring misfortune. Because throughout history, there was always someone wishing misfortune on the Jewish communities of Europe, we developed a cultural tradition of not bringing too much attention to good things before they happened so as not to provoke the *ayin harah*. It is for this reason why it is customary not to say *mazel tov!* (congratulations) when you hear someone is pregnant, but *b'sha'ah tovah*, which instead wishes that the baby will come at a good and auspicious time.\n\nThese superstitions have nothing to do with Jewish law and everything to do with the history of persecution Ashkenazi Jews suffered. I don't actually believe that misfortune will befall me if someone looks at me wrong. But I do feel uncomfortable with the idea, and since it's not a part of my culture, I felt no desire to do something that I knew would stress me out and make me second guess myself. \n\nThanks for asking such a thoughtful question and for the well wishes!", "This is one of the most heartwarming things I've read - what a wonderful group of coworker friends.", "Or it\u2019s very early\u2026. And I\u2019m up feeding my \u2018permanently starving\u2019 (according to her), 18 year old beagle\u2026. Who can\u2019t wait for a decent hour for breakfast.", "Thank you for your reply! It is very informative and helpful! Stay true to your beliefs! I'm sorry that your friends don't understand or tolerate them.", "Thank you for taking the time to explain this. Makes a lot of sense. Wishing safe arrival of your baby at a good time!", "B\u2019sha\u2019ah tovah, my friend. I really wish you the best, I really do.", "Nta. This is also a fairly widespread superstition among the Irish, regardless of religion. And if you order prams, cots etc from a reputable shop in the Uk or Ireland they  let you accept delivery after the baby is born, or cancel if you have bad news. I started out with the absolute basics. Then my mother arrived with lots of stuff that she had accepted from friends and family,  but stored elsewhere. Can't think of anything worse than going home after a tragedy to a house full of kitsch. Our ancestors had more wisdom than Eliza", "I am mixed Ashkenazi and Mizrahi/Sephardi and there are actually very similar ideas on the Mizrahi side. Some of my Muslim and Christian friends from the Middle East have similar traditions, superstitions and speech patterns that come down to not tempting the Evil Eye. \n\nEssentially celebrating a pregnancy is seen as counting your chickens before they hatch. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not done. When you have good luck, you\u2019re quick to express your gratitude for it rather than draw attention to it. Eg:\n\nFriend A: how are you?\n\nFriend B: thank God.\n\nThank God is the complete answer.\n\nSimilarly if someone mentions the future, no matter how mundanely, your answer reminds all concerned that you are not so arrogant as to assume you know what\u2019s coming:\n\n\u201cRebecca? She\u2019s well, thank God. Yes she\u2019ll be fifteen in March, God willing!\u201d\n\nAnyway NTA OP. \n\nImagine if you told your coworker\u2019s 5 year old that Santa is a piece of cultural fiction just because you personally can\u2019t wrap your head around asking children to literally believe in this. In a pluralistic society we do our best to honor one another\u2019s culture and background even when it doesn\u2019t totally make sense to us.\n\nB\u2019shaah tova, wishing you a healthy pregnancy and baby.", "Evil eye is a very strong belief held by Indians as well. We also consider baby showers in the Western sense bad luck. We do have our version of the baby shower but it\u2019s more focused on the mother. Traditional gifts for a safe delivery and a healthy infant. In fact the first clothes a baby is dressed are always hand me downs as it\u2019s bad luck to purchase anything for the baby before it\u2019s born.", "Honestly speak after several stillborns my wife and i had that tradition makes brutal sense.", "That\u2019s very interested. When my brother did a year in Grease he bought me a necklace to protect me from the evil eye. I unfortunately lost it at school I think ( I am pretty sure a staff member stole it after it was taken from me as punishment since I didn\u2019t get a lot of jewelry back from that school when I left).", "It was one of the best places I ever worked at. We had a really diverse group and a really diverse population (I worked in healthcare).", "I am not Jewish, but I didn\u2019t want a baby shower during either of my pregnancies because I felt like it would be bad luck. Kind of like tempting fate. Similarly, we didn\u2019t pick out a name for our babies before they were born. We had shortlists we chose from after they were born and we\u2019d \u201cmet\u201d them.", "My Aunty doesn't remember naming her son. She was had a emergency C section and after he was placed on her chest she turned to his Dad told him the name, he loved it instantly. I was fortunate enough to get to see them while she was still in the operating room (I was staying the night at her house, got to go to the hospital 3 times and sit in the waiting room for 12ish hours) and she introduced me to him with the full name.\n\nIt's a family joke now that she was glad she told us, because the named chosen weren't on the short list.", "I didn't name any of my kids either until we met them. I was in the hospital for 2 days with my youngest, and I had no idea what to name them. I was told I couldn't leave with the baby until the birth certificate was filled out.", "Same! After two days they were like \u201cyou have to give this baby a name NOW.\u201d The pressure \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude2c", "That pressure is really unhelpful. In my country you get six weeks to register the birth and receive a birth certificate. You don\u2019t have to settle on a name immediately."]}
