Dogs are not gifts, they are 10+ year commitments.\n\nWorking dogs breeds like a GSD are hard, doubly so as puppies. GSDs, unlike more low maintenance dogs, need structure and a \"job\" in the household. They need, at minimum, 60-90 minutes a day of vigorous exercise (a walk around the block will not do), intense training + mental stimulation, and consistency. They also have a tendency to guard and be overly protective, so jumping on any discipline issues early is a must. Oh and they shed like crazy, so regular brushing is a must. I will also say that due to their size and consideration as an \"aggressive breed,\" every single negative interaction the GSD has with another dog will be, in the court of public opinion, your dog's fault. Little dog barks at your GSD and lunges at your dog, and the GSD snaps back? Your fault. Your dog accidentally runs into someone's leg at the dog park? Your fault.\n\nI have a rescue GSD who was very likely dumped as an adolescent dog when someone was overwhelmed with the training and exercise needs of having a working dog. In fact, the breed has a very high surrender rate to shelters simply because of the family's inability to provide enough exercise/stimulation, resulting in discipline issues. Even though I worked from home and had few other commitments, training my GSD was a commitment in and of itself. He now knows nearly 40 commands but I had to do all that myself.\n\nTo give you an idea of my typical routine, I need to run my adult GSD a minimum of 6 miles a day. MINIMUM. Some days I make do with 30 minutes of aggressive fetch, where he is nonstop sprinting, but I try to supplement that throughout the day with training, puzzle toys, tug of war, and other stimulation. You can't just let a GSD run in the yard (although having a second dog helps with energy outlet), you actually have to interact with / exercise them.\n\nIf your husband wanted a GSD, he should have created a situation where he is the primary handler/owner, not dumped these responsibilities on you. Talk to him about returning the puppy to the breeder.", "NTA. German Shepards take a lot of work and are going to be more high energy than your shi tzu and labrador. A dog deserves a home where it gets the full care it needs, and it sounds like right now that won\u2019t be the case.", "NTA. This is a big decision that he, as your partner, should have enough respect to come to the decision together", "NTA does your husband take good care of the dogs you already have and take them to the park/train them? Play with them? Give them good quality of life? If no then he has no business getting another dog let alone a puppy. \n\nNot only does a puppy require a lot of care but a GS is going to require proper training. I was recently bit by a GS, 8-10 months old and the owner was like, \u201cshe\u2019s just a puppy!\u201d Sir that\u2019s a 45lb puppy that you haven\u2019t trained at all that thank goodness bit my pants and didn\u2019t get my skin. Smart breeds that don\u2019t get proper training will end up in bad situations that may cost them their lives. Imagine if it had bitten a child. \n\nIt\u2019s not heartless to find a proper home for the dog. What is heartless is getting a puppy, not taking proper care of it and creating a stressful situation for the yourself and the dog later on.

I don\u2019t understand how he expected you to take on this very big extra responsibility. That should be the focus of your conversation - you already have enough on your plate and didn\u2019t agree to this.\n\nFrom the dog\u2019s perspective, the puppy is going to get big fast and GSDs require a lot of attention and training. A month old puppy is way too young to come home, they\u2019re going to be missing essential learnings from their mama and litter mates. *I\u2019d be very concerned about the long term effects and safety of my kids.* Speaking from experience I have 2 GSDs and one of them is aggressive towards most other dogs, even though he was raised with another dog.", "Reputable breeders do not release their quality puppies until they are 8 weeks old, minimum.

But I think you could relay it to your husband.\n\nWhen I went to a rescue that focused on German Shepherds to adopt my dog, I saw a family trying to surrender their German Shepherd. Now this dog was not only quite big, but it was HUGE. Like obese. Easily 100+ pounds. And this family had a couple young kids. They clearly loved this dog. But even the dad of the family could not control the dog on a leash, and was being pulled this way and that by the dog as it wanted to sniff things. I overheard the father begging the head trainer to take the dog, but apparently the dog had failed a temperament test and tried to either bite the trainer or another dog. I also heard that apparently this dog had bitten another family member and the kids were starting to be afraid of the dog. The family begged, but eventually took the dog away.\n\nI think about that family a lot. Their dog, who was never trained correctly and never exercised, and thus was both dangerous and overweight as a result of their carelessness and was paying the price. Many shelters will not take dogs with a bite history as they are not easily adoptable. Most likely, that dog was euthanized given its aggression.\n\nI tell you this story because I think your husband needs to understand that what he has done to your family -- you -- and the dog -- is profoundly unfair. This dog will be in your care until basically your youngest is college age. He bought the dog from a disreputable source that has taken the puppy away from its mother far too young, setting up the potential for health and behavioral problems. And he is already not doing the hard work necessary for success, and expects you to do it. That is profoundly selfish, and could end up in a situation like the very sad one I witnessed with the family I outlined.

I usually adopt seniors from responsible breeders, the pound, or rescue groups.

I've had a decent amount of success with it, though, and it's worth considering.\n\nIf that doesn't appeal... weirdly, rescue greyhounds seem to be a really popular choice for a comparatively low-effort larger dog. I've known a couple of people who had them, and they really did just seem to laze about most of the day. They still need exercise, of course, and preferably an option to run a couple times a week, but they don't seem to need the sustained effort of a working dog. \n\n*(People who actually own greyhounds, please correct me if I'm wrong!)*", "For what it's worth, that your husband got a puppy and isn't even engaged in the difficult act of house-training is deeply unfair.", "Of course the kids love the puppy but this seems cruel on his part.

He got the puppy for selfish reasons and leaving you to do the work. Every dog deserves lots of love, attention, park visits, dog parks, training etc. He\u2019s not around enough to be available for a puppy and on his days off doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll step up either.", "... why are you with this object?", "I have a major soft spot for working breeds, GSD\u2019s in particular. My first dog was a GSD and I was involved in all of the training, exercise, and care (at 8 years old) and that was my boy for the next 11 years. It\u2019s a wonderful breed. But they are definitely not for the casual dog owner. It\u2019s a type of dog you work *with*. You develop a partnership with. Not just a dog to greet you when you get home or only play with in the back yard. That requires lots of time and training. And that training and working together doesn\u2019t have an end date. Certainly doesn\u2019t stop when the pup follows basic commands. You need to keep that partnership in tip top shape.

That\u2019s a GIANT red flag. That is from a backyard breeder that gives zero shits about the dog. No careful and selective breeding for a stable temperament or good health. No care for the consequences of separating a puppy far to young when it should still be with its mother and litter mates learning behavioral skills.

It's interesting if that's true.  \nBut is that really what the kids want/need?\n\nIf he wants to spend more time with you guys the two of you should sit down and talk about that.  \nMost of us have a tendency to do things without fully realising why we are doing it.  \nI really hope you will be able to communicate properly with each other. Sometimes we also forgot what it was that we wanted in the first place. If he wants a family then it's important that you guys get to be a family.\n\nIf your kids are old enough they might have thoughts too on what's best.", "I agree. The puppy will be better off with someone who can take better care of him.", "I did use puppy pads. I run out already. This lil one pisses like there\u2019s no tomorrow.", "I know I\u2019m burned out. Maybe he is too but he doesn\u2019t like to talk about his work because for him work stops when he enters the house.", "GS' are smart, loyal, hardworking, and very trainable. But all of that comes with the caveat that they also require a lot of work early on. So if neither one of you really has the time it's most likely going to backfire to have a GS. It's not really a \"family dog\" it's a \"working dog\".", "Thank you. I would rather rehome him than put him in a shelter.", "I will talk to him again. We need to sort this out early. Thank you so much.", "Puppies do that especially younger ones. \n\nIt might be gross but get more puppy pads and place one rag that you use to clean up the puppy accidents(place them in the middle). Then show the puppy the pads with the rags on it. Make get the big puppy pads though because it will give more space for the puppy. \n\nBut tell your husband that he will have to clean ANY accidents the puppy has off the pads even after he gets home.", "That was my initial thought, that it\u2019s not a family dog. That you for this.", "NTA! A month old puppy absolutely needs to be with their mother and litter mates!  They should never leave their mother until 8 weeks at the very earliest, he's setting you up for a lifetime of behaviour issues too, those 8 weeks are incredibly important in their development and health", "Info : why do you want to have a conversation with your husband when he refuses to listen to anything you say ?", "Your husbands behaviour is careless, selfish, irresponsible and infuriating.\nI\u2019m honestly disgusted by his actions.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is all dumped on you. And I\u2019m so sorry for the puppy.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd show him this post.", "Agree. Him clearly bringing the puppy home at just over a month meant he does not know anything about raising a GS.", "Because I do not want to go down his level by being rude. This second conversation will determine my next course of action. If he is amenable now to rehome the puppy then we will avoid fighting. If he does not listen to reason even after I lay down to him the cons and still wants to have the puppy without the accountability then I will rehome the puppy myself when he\u2019s at work.", "I legit told my husband that I would rather have another baby than adopt another puppy. I stand by that statement even though the \u201cpuppy\u201d is now a 5 year old. Never again. Rehome the pup and ditch the husband. Your life will be easier all the way around.", "NTA. Better to return them as pups then to shelter them in a few months. Maximise their chances of finding a home", "NTA. We had a German Shepherd. As an adolescent he grabbed me by the leg and dragged me through the yard. The next day my parents surrendered him while I was at school. I didn't understand why at the time, but yeah, they need training. My aunt's also tried to bite me when I went to let her out of her crate to the bathroom bc I came into her house without her master (the dog knew me). You have to be careful.", "One month? Find the puppy a better home and find out where your husband got it from and blast the place as much as you can on social media or whatever. Dunno if police will help but puppies cant be rehomed at that age! Irresponsible seller, irresponsible husband and poor puppy!!!! NTA", "Great idea to showing him this post and all the comments that are in consensus to rehoming the puppy.", "I will. Thank you for this.", "I have a mini dachshund just lies about sleeping , does not care if he walks or not", "I'm sorry that you've been put in this situation. It's absolutely unfair to you AND the kids AND the puppy.", "I have a king charles cavalier spaniel who is quite a lazy little boy (to my delight!) but the breed can be expensive. mine was gifted to me otherwise I wouldn't have purchased him tbh but I love him more than anything in the world", "A big key is that it\u2019s not shameful to admit a mistake especially if you have your family to help you fix it.", "Lol. The ditch the husband just brought a smile to my face. I am that stressed that giving him up is also a very good solution right now. Thank you for making me smile.", "You know I told the kids today we might be giving up the puppy. I had to tell them the truth about raising the puppy. It\u2019s so heartbreaking to see their reaction but at the same time I was proud to see them understand the situation.", "It's a shitty situation, but it's so good to see that they understand AND it's so good for them to see you stand up for yourself and your needs."]}
