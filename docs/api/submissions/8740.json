Generally, the only line was \"I don't need to check food prices because my bills will still be paid.\"\n\nI think it is a little shocking to see how food insecurity looks \"in the real world\" for some people, as there are myths about who \"should\" access various types of food banks.

Sometimes bringing friends to load up. It was incredibly frustrating, and we eventually had to put a staff member on that area to control it. \n\nBut those were local folks upset our facility existed, and I think there was more than \"scamming\" going on and more of a statement about how \"those people\" shouldn't be the only ones to get free food.", "....
