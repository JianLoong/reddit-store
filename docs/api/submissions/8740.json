All students qualify and you can go once a week. To relieve some of the pressure on my family, I go to the food bank every week and we stock the fridge/pantry with what we do eat and anything in the boxes that we don't eat is donated. For example, we get milk and eggs a couple times a month. We raise chickens so we don't usually need the eggs and most of my family is lactose intolerant and can't have the milk so we give them to the single mom in the apartment down the street or if we get a snack that we don't like we either give it to someone that w know needs it or we drop it off in a food donation bin. \n\nSomeone I know saw me in line for the food bank and called me selfish for going since she's seen my house and knows we can afford it (we have a big house in a good neighborhood but we bought it for next to nothing because it was unlivable and my dad, uncle, and their friends had to spend over a year fixing it up).

Food insecurity and not being able to eat are different things. I think you are a perfect example of someone who can and should eat at the food bank which is why they don\u2019t gate keep it for a certain income threshold. \nI had food stamps in college but people would argue I \u201cmade too much\u201d to qualify because I was able to afford going to college. People shouldn\u2019t have to make a choice between eating ramen, eating a well balanced meal or affording gas.", "NTA.  She jumped to an incorrect conclusion.  You are food insecure and that's what the food is for.", "You don\u2019t need to be dirt poor to benefit from a food bank.  Food insecurity is real.  \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n>My family is broke enough that we struggle with a lot of everyday expenses and qualify for some government assistance\n\nThis here says it all. Don't worry about what others think. If you are being honest about needing the help, then that's all that matters.", "NTA, honestly people need to mind their own business. Why you choose or not to use the food pantry should be up to you. As you stated, you are being very conscious of the resources and sharing what you don't use. You are so incredibly blessed to have a hard-working family that supports you and that you are educating yourself.", "NTA. Poverty isn't a contest. If you feel that your family needs the food, take the food.", "NTA.\n\nFood pantries are for ANYBODY who needs them.  Full stop.", "NTA. This is your way of contributing to a struggling household as an adult child who still lives in it.  You have a need and the food is put to the use for which it is intended. Your friend is horrible for passing any judgment on someone who is standing in line for food bank assistance, it's just not her place.", "NTA.\n\nIf every student qualifies even if you had an amazing financial situation it\u2019d be okay for you to go. Unless your college makes specific rules to qualify that it\u2019s only for students that can\u2019t afford other options, you\u2019re not the a-hole.", "There's a saying, \"everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.\"\n\nPoint being, that person should have never opened their mouth.

There can be wrong in taking more than your fair share and leaving others who need it more without, so the context is important.", "NTA. Someone\u2019s house isn\u2019t indicative of their financial situation. It could be inherited, a fixer upper like you said, etc. If all students qualify for the food bank, you\u2019re not taking advantage of it.

Furthermore, the person calling you one definitely is because they don't actually know anything about your situation. Even if they've been to your house, they don't actually know your situation. They're assuming, and from your description wrongly, your level of income based on a few pieces of the picture. There are literally thousands of people who are in deep debt and struggling paycheck to paycheck in this country while also owning a $500k home and an $80k car, with a high loan payment and little, zero, or negative equity on both.

Appearances can be deceiving and I am sure the people who donate to and fund the food bank are a lot less concerned than she is with whether you're completely destitute or just need a little boost.", "NTA, fuck that person. They are wrong.\n\nI wrote this about food pantries last year\u2014I don\u2019t know how the one at your school specifically works but it\u2019s likely they have more than enough in terms of food and you\u2019re not \u201cusing up\u201d limited food.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/rgzurj/as\\_a\\_regular\\_volunteer\\_please\\_use\\_food\\_pantries/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/rgzurj/as_a_regular_volunteer_please_use_food_pantries/)\n\nBut even if it is limited, who cares?

If the bank started running out of goods or started setting income requirements, maybe you should not go, but as it is, what \"money is tight\" means is different to people of different income levels.  Until you have knowledge that you're taking from someone else whose money is much tighter, I think you're fine.  \n\n\nNTA.", "As the Irishman said when he was kicked by the jackass, consider the source.

If people don't use it, it gets overlooked in funding, and that would actually be more harmful. The simple way to have answered this question is this:  \n\n\nDoes your family eat food? If answer is yes, then NTA. If no, I am terrified.", "NTA. I'm homeless and I stop at every building in my school to pick up snacks like granola bars, hot chocolate, chips, fruit snacks etc so I don't waste fam's food at home (motel room but hey, home is where the heart is). One time I even scored a hotpocket. My family also own two bmws and an audi (doesnt work rn lmao), and I have a mercedes (which also doesnt work atm but. It will. \ud83d\ude25.) \u2014 each of them were below 3k at auction n we just happened to come up. I recently found out my cc also has a food pantry that gives food for free (we have to pay for food) n planned on visiting some time this or next week but have worried about it bc why is this person who pulls up in a 7 series looking for free food? This post made me realize there is no need to give a fuck at all. We need the food, they're offering the food, what are we doing in the wrong? That person does not know your personal situation. They're lacking consideration. Once again, NTA.", "NTA for helping your family with some essentials from the food bank. Edited for definitely not the AH since re donating un-needed items. Thanks for clarification below.", "NTA but the person who dared say anything about your getting food is a huge AH and you should never speak to them again.", "NTA\n\nIf a program helps you *use it*. Suffering isn\u2019t a contest where only the people in the dire-est of straits deserves help. If that were true there would be exactly one person on earth that \u201cdeserves\u201d help and that\u2019s ridiculous. These programs exist to make sure that students have time to focus on school instead of worrying about things like should \u201cwe only eat ramen or heat the house?\u201d. Your family is struggling, the food pantry helps, so *use it*.\n\nAs a side note all these programs get funded *because* people use them.
