I would argue that \"paying for college\" counts as a necessity for students.", "And that\u2019s fine. I assumed other people might draw the line slightly differently. \n\nBut there is a line in there somewhere. \n\nIt\u2019s not always going to be ok for people to use food banks to \u201cjust\u201d increase their savings. There will be a lot of times that\u2019s just selfishness. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not necessarily something food bank staff could or should police. \n\nJust - if someone is asking \u201cam I the AH for using a food bank in my specific circumstances\u201d, these are the boundaries I think would be up for consideration.", "Oh I read it as OP was currently at \u201cschool\u201d and the savings were for a future \u201ccollege\u201d. \n\nCould be wrong.", "If using the food bank means OP\u2019s parents can fix the water heater, or afford tuition for a class, that\u2019s fantastic.", "Yeah, their parents already own the home, they aren\u2019t saving to buy it. And owning one doesn\u2019t mean a person has money in the bank.\n\nFood pantries have fresh food, donated by stores, and if they don\u2019t give it all out they have to dispose of it. Everything isn\u2019t a can of beans.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never worked at a distribution center you probably should give it a go and then you might rethink your opinion.", "Community college", "Yeah my company donates a lot of perishable goods - over-runs, discontinuations, etc that are still within date.\n\nObviously if the food bank can\u2019t use it in time then it\u2019s still waste.  A lot of bakeries and places will do the same with their end of day. \n\nOne local casual dining place used to donate their leftovers to the local senior home down the street as long as it wasn\u2019t temperature sensitive.", "I didn\u2019t say they were saving to buy it. \n\nI said that using \u201cfood bank money\u201d to pay for a property you never could afford is *equivalent to* using it to put money into savings because of equity.", "NTA.  I get why people look askance at people who have \"fancy\" things using the food bank. But it isn't rational.  If you were to sell your house to move into a low-budget rental where you are at risk of a no-fault eviction, your family would actually be more precariously perched than it is now.  Not to mention how disruptive moving would be for your kids.  Prioritizing the roof over head by using the food bank prevents you from being both homeless and hungry.", "> My family is broke\n\neasy NTA", "NTA, if you have any opportunities then you should use them to the best of your abilities. People really only see things from an outside perspective, they dont know what the inner workings or happenings but judge anyway. In this case it's your family living in a nice house in a nice neighborhood but they don't know how hard you and your family are struggling to keep it. It's the same way people put on tough or easy going facades but in reality they could be as sick as can be (take Chadwick Boseman, he's a perfect example of this). \n\nDo what you have to do to take care of your family, don't listen to anyone else's complaints because they only see the outside and not the whole truth.", "NTA Don\u2019t let people talk you out of it. My friend gave me hell over taking student benefits because she thought my family were richer than hers (we weren\u2019t). I stopped because I felt guilty and I very much struggled. Now I pay the highest marginal tax rate as a healthcare professional. I think I was silly for struggling when I didn\u2019t have to back then.

If you qualify for the school\u2019s food bank, then use it.  The person who called you out on it is TA.

I was sick for a couple of years after injury  (repeated sepsis) and I couldn\u2019t work. I had a little money, but no prospect of earning more for a while, so I had to save where I could to eke it out. I didn\u2019t want to sponge off my elderly parents. Cue learning to cook fresh (cheap) vegetables and lots of big batches of vegetable soup. Plus pasta, making my own pizza rather than takeout etc.\n\nI learned to respect everyone on the breadline, especially if they have kids. It\u2019s tough!", "NTA. Most food banks actually have issues with too much food because they get a ton of donations and not enough people use their services.

It is there to help and you donate when you can. People will judge regards just do what you think is moral.", "Ugh- NTA- I am currently unemployed. I drive a niceish car that I paid for in full while I was working. I can\u2019t replace it bc it has a third row which I need to fir my kids and it would cost me more than I paid for this one to get a \u201ccheaper\u201d one bc the market changed. I\u2019ve had a few women comment when I went to pick up food offered through my kids school. Its embarrassing but this is what social services are for.

People are so prideful that they\u2019ll do anything not to use a food bank. I used the food bank for YEARS and it was a godsend. Some friends would judge me or say they were poor too but that they wouldn\u2019t use the food bank because \u201csomeone else needed it more\u201d. We\u2019ll guess what, it\u2019s for people like you, and me. Not just homeless people, but housed people with income issues.

You\u2019re eligible as a student  so there\u2019s nothing wrong with what you need, but stop stocking up and giving the extras to other people.  They should be using their own neighborhood food banks.  Just take what you\u2019re going to use, period.  Otherwise you\u2019re misusing the food bank.", "NTA - The person that confronted you doesn't know your circumstance and shouldn't judge you just because of what your house looks like. Also , from what you said you give items you don't use or need to others that need it which is very thoughtful. If the food bank is open to all students without question, nobody who sees you in line has the right to question you either.", "YTA. In the past at food banks near me ( in the US) I have seen people in fully loaded trucks with the ac blasting, they leave all vehicles on for an hour while on line, cars that cost a minimum of 40k and they are all brand new. Then I see the flip side to this with people who literally are killing themselves working, coupon, and shop at grocery outlets ( I do too it\u2019s way cheaper) do not take any assistance. If your house is that large you all need to sell it and move it is not fair to take away food items from people who need it. If the house you live in is over 600k you are really TA.", "NTA", "Very true.   I have a relative who worked at a food shelf for years.   They said that they are there to help so you never get to a crisis point.   Food shelves (especially those at colleges) WANT to help.

It doesn't sound like they actually have control over getting milk or not, so giving the milk to the single mother neighbor is actually the ethical and moral choice because milk has an incredibly short shelf life and also spoils quickly when not stored properly, so what they are doing with the milk is absolutely 100% the correct choice, especially because it is going to a **single mother**.", "How is she an asshole?
