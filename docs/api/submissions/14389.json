We don't live together but I stay over at his most weekends. For a few months now it's slowly become a regular thing where he will try to jump scare me. It started off just being whilst we were watching a scary film he'd jump during a tense scene to in turn make me jump. Then it transitioned to him hiding behind the bed when I'd come back from the bathroom to jump out on me. For context, I'm easily scared and jump very easily. I have no idea why this even started as we were together for almost a year and a half/2 years before this even became a thing.\n\nI'd sometimes try to \"get my own back\" and also hide when he'd come out the bathroom to scare him. These kind of pranks I'd been mostly ok with. I mean I'd rather they weren't a thing but I just took at as him being playful so I was trying to do the same back.\n\nI can't even remember at what point they took this turn but he started randomly jumping up in bed when I'm trying to get to sleep. He'll jump up and pretend he heard something or saw something. Or pretend something was dragging him out of bed. Again to begin with I laughed it off as he'd just do it once or twice and then stop and I'd be able to fall asleep. Then he started doing it more and more each evening. He started just jumping randomly for about an hour or so right after we'd go to bed in an attempt to make me jump and scare me.\n\nWell, the scaring worked and I'd end up feeling so on edge and anxious that I then couldn't fall asleep for an hour or two after he stopped. It got to the point where I'd say to him when he kept doing this that I don't like it, it makes me uncomfortable/uneasy and I'd ask him to please stop. He'd just laugh off my requests as if I'm just joking but he did put a stop to doing this, or so I thought.\n\nHe'd stopped for a good few weeks but as of last night has started doing this again when I was trying to fall asleep. I kept asking him to please stop and saying I don't like when he does this but he continued. I ended up snapping and telling him that I'm being serious and to stop. I felt so uneasy again, I was shaking and my heart was racing. He just laughed and rolled over, but did stop. I ended up crying quietly in bed next to him because I thought this had stopped and him doing this again for the first time after a few weeks resulted in me feeling more on edge than ever. Plus the fact that I was clearly upset when asking him for the final time to stop yet all he did was laugh and roll over.\n\nI'm now back in my own home whilst typing this and I'm considering messaging him to ask if we can seriously talk about this so really my question is AITA for reacting in this way to my boyfriend's playfulness/jump scare pranks.", "created_utc": 1681052437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12glslo/aita_for_not_finding_my_boyfriends_scare_pranks/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A significant other that cares about and respects you would STOP doing what you say you don't like, especially taking in the fact that he only started doing this after 2.5 years of relationship. \n\nHonestly, I'd be questioning if his other attributes in the relationship are worth being so nervous every time you go to his house, and knowing he doesn't respect you enough to stop when you ask. Good luck, OP,  just know you deserve better and you don't have to put up with his crap. (I'm incredibly glad to read that you two don't live together and you have your own home.)", "NTA.

Even if you initially thought it was funny/cute/playful you\u2019re allowed to change your mind.

When someone repeatedly does something that you don\u2019t like, even after you have asked them to stop, and it\u2019s a reasonable ask, then there are consequences. \n\nIt sounds like he isn\u2019t really paying attention to what you are saying. That might be a sign he doesn\u2019t understand how much it bothers you. It\u2019s possible that he does and doesn\u2019t think it matters much. I\u2019m hoping for the first option, because that is possible to correct. The latter really isn\u2019t.\n\nDon\u2019t text him about it. Just respond in the moment when he does it next. Tell him to stop doing that, firmly. State that you don\u2019t enjoy it and you won\u2019t spend time with him when he does things like that. If he responds with laughter, you have some options. If he responds with an apology or contrition, great. \n\nIf you want to demonstrate that it isn\u2019t cool and you won\u2019t put up with it, take some harmless action that demonstrates your point. Get glass of cold water (preferably ice water) and pour it on his groin. It won\u2019t be comfortable, but it also won\u2019t do any permanent damage.
