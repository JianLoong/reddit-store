We don't live together but I stay over at his most weekends. For a few months now it's slowly become a regular thing where he will try to jump scare me. It started off just being whilst we were watching a scary film he'd jump during a tense scene to in turn make me jump. Then it transitioned to him hiding behind the bed when I'd come back from the bathroom to jump out on me. For context, I'm easily scared and jump very easily. I have no idea why this even started as we were together for almost a year and a half/2 years before this even became a thing.\n\nI'd sometimes try to \"get my own back\" and also hide when he'd come out the bathroom to scare him. These kind of pranks I'd been mostly ok with. I mean I'd rather they weren't a thing but I just took at as him being playful so I was trying to do the same back.\n\nI can't even remember at what point they took this turn but he started randomly jumping up in bed when I'm trying to get to sleep. He'll jump up and pretend he heard something or saw something. Or pretend something was dragging him out of bed. Again to begin with I laughed it off as he'd just do it once or twice and then stop and I'd be able to fall asleep. Then he started doing it more and more each evening. He started just jumping randomly for about an hour or so right after we'd go to bed in an attempt to make me jump and scare me.\n\nWell, the scaring worked and I'd end up feeling so on edge and anxious that I then couldn't fall asleep for an hour or two after he stopped. It got to the point where I'd say to him when he kept doing this that I don't like it, it makes me uncomfortable/uneasy and I'd ask him to please stop. He'd just laugh off my requests as if I'm just joking but he did put a stop to doing this, or so I thought.\n\nHe'd stopped for a good few weeks but as of last night has started doing this again when I was trying to fall asleep. I kept asking him to please stop and saying I don't like when he does this but he continued. I ended up snapping and telling him that I'm being serious and to stop. I felt so uneasy again, I was shaking and my heart was racing. He just laughed and rolled over, but did stop. I ended up crying quietly in bed next to him because I thought this had stopped and him doing this again for the first time after a few weeks resulted in me feeling more on edge than ever. Plus the fact that I was clearly upset when asking him for the final time to stop yet all he did was laugh and roll over.\n\nI'm now back in my own home whilst typing this and I'm considering messaging him to ask if we can seriously talk about this so really my question is AITA for reacting in this way to my boyfriend's playfulness/jump scare pranks.", "created_utc": 1681052437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12glslo/aita_for_not_finding_my_boyfriends_scare_pranks/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That may bring it home to him.\n\nThat said, if you decide enough is enough, and anyone with half a brain would have listened to you the first time, then going straight to breaking up is also a valid response.", "YWBTA if you continue to subject yourself to this. As my 8 year old grand will tell you No means No and if someone says stop, you stop. If she knows that, why don't you? Your bf sounds sadistic, I would either stop sleeping over or better yet stop seeing him", "If a prank causes distress or upset someone, it is just bullying. NTA", "NTA.  He's consistently disrespectful.  You need to drop him.", "NTA. I typically refrain from telling people to break up with their SO in posts on this sub, but I definitely think yours calls for it. What kind of man takes it to the point that his girlfriend goes to sleep crying next to him and just laughs about it?? You deserve to feel safe and secure, especially in bed at night. \n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this. I'd put a hard boundary that if he does it again you won't come over.", "NTA. Im personally hyper against people picking on others via jumpscares and/or phobias. If this is making you as uncomfortable as you say it is, demand an end to those actions. If they continue after that, then I think the best thing you can do is ask yourself why youre with someone that doesnt respect you.", "He is an abusive loser. Ghost his ass and block him on everything.", "From the title, I expected half your ages.\n\nNTA. Jump scaring isn't funny most of the time.", "NTA, a joke is only funny if everyone\u2019s laughing. Your boyfriend is incredibly cruel and sociopathic. He clearly thinks it\u2019s hilarious to cause you immense fear and anxiety, so why would you stay with someone like that? I know your history complicates things, but if I were you I\u2019d get out of there before he gives you a heart attack.", "NTA but please run. It\u2019s a red flag parade here.", "NTA.\n\nI am sorry, OP, but you have to break up with this guy.  This isn't love.", "Jesus christ girl RUN. RUN RIGHT NOW. \n\nActing childish? \u2705   \nScaring you unnecessarily? \u2705   \nViolating clear boundaries you've set? \u2705\n\nIf you're basically having a panic attack afterwards, then it's not playfulness or pranks, it's abuse.\n\nAnd as someone who's been the person crying quietly in bed while my ex slept beside me, let me tell you, that's not a relationship worth being in. \n\nNTA, of course.", "Why, OP are you with a guy who is so heartless that when you are crying next to him because of something he did, he just rolls over and goes to sleep?? \n\nLike how possibly could this be ok and you still wanting to be with him? \n\nI don\u2019t get it. Do you think you are so worthless, that you deserve this kind of treatment from the person who is meant to love you? \n\nPlease please \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb put the whole man in the trash already. You\u2019ll be surprised how your anxiety will mysteriously vanish with him.", "Yes!  One of my favorite sayings- They are showing you who they are, believe them", "I came here to say this. He's literally terrorizing you, OP. Definitely NTA, you need to talk to him for sure, and hopefully it stops.", "This is a great comment", "She is honestly better off ending it now. This is full stop abuse. Emotional terrorism. It will not get better.", "Not necessarily. My boyfriend used to think my reaction  was absolutely hilarious when he would scare me. I have ptsd so most of the time, I'm hyper vigilant. I finally told my boyfriend that if he ever did it again, our relationship was over. He believed me and has never done it again.", "She has explained it so many times that if he doesn't understand by now, he is too stupid to date.", "The pepper spray would really be more for entertainment than explanation.", "She was begging him to stop and crying in bed. She *cried* and he laughed at her and went to sleep.", "She says she cried after he already went to sleep?\n\nYou guys give too much credit for the guy. If he's stupid enough to think these pranks are funny it's very plausible that he is clueless and unawere of how his actions affects other. None of us were there when it happened.", "NTA, and isn't he a bit old for that crap?  He should have stopped the first time you asked him to.  That he didn't and just laughed it off, continuing to do it shows his disrespect for your feelings and his immaturity.  This would be a dealbreaker for me.", "NTA. My wife will scare the fuck out of me every so often and vice versa and it's all in good fun, but what you're describing here sounds like some sort of psychological abuse. This is a pretty serious problem. If it was me I would send him packing.", "NTA It\u2019s time to put an end to this relationship and let him find someone who enjoys pranks as he will always continue to do them.", "NTA. I personally think scaring people is hilarious, but only if I know they'll also find it funny--if not, it isn't actually fun or funny and just makes me an AH. At this point, I'd say it's gone beyond disrespect and actually shows a complete lack of regard for you and your feelings overall. If y'all were 18 or something I might write this off as just being dumb and immature, but there's no excuse for a 31yo man to keep ignoring your feelings like this. Why doesn't he care that he's upsetting you so badly? You are so so so NTA and your feelings need to be respected and honored here.", "NTA! your BF is so incredibly disrespectful. That\u2019s a huge \ud83d\udea9", "NTA - break up with him babe", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is too damned immature to be in a relationship right now, and he cannot be trusted.  Hear that, please.  HE IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY.  He is a passive-aggressive bully who will make the rest of your life freaking miserable.  Unless he's willing to get therapy and change his ways, leave him.", "\" I felt so uneasy again, I was shaking and my heart was racing. He just laughed and rolled over, but did stop. I ended up crying quietly in bed next to him because I thought this had stopped and him doing this again for the first time after a few weeks resulted in me feeling more on edge than ever. Plus the fact that I was clearly upset when asking him for the final time to stop yet all he did was laugh and roll over.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is your ex-boyfriend, right?  Because he rolled over and went to sleep after purposefully making you cry.  That's abuse.  He hurt you, enjoyed hurting you, and will continue to hurt you in the future.  That's your future with him.  Get out now.", "Worst part is you are getting conditioned to expect it so you'll be anxious for it to happen. And it's hard to untrained yourself from this.", " Thankfully, it appears you don't live together.", "OP has told her boyfriend multiple times that she doesn\u2019t like it though. I have ptsd as well. My ex learned so many ways to torture me."]}
