For her 16th birthday, Mike bought Addie a used, but still very nice, car. She totaled it two months later in an accident where she was 100% at fault, and Mike did not buy her another one.\n\nSo far, she\u2019s gotten by with Mike\u2019s car, but he recently had to take a business trip out of town, and was worried about her being home alone without a car. He asked me to lend her my car for a few days as a favor (my wife and I each have one, and it wouldn\u2019t be a major inconvenience to me). I reluctantly agreed. \n\nWhen it was time for me to take my car back, Mike told me that Addie had accidentally put diesel in it and that it had died in their driveway. I had it towed to a repair shop, and asked for $1500 (the amount quoted to my by the mechanic) from Mike to get it fixed. Mike told me that he would transfer the money soon, and I told him to take as much time as he needed. \n\nLater that afternoon, Mike\u2019s wife Lisa called me to tell me that the money for my car would be coming out of Addie\u2019s already meager college fund. She begged me to let the money go because Addie needs that money for college. She actually started crying, and I started feeling really bad. The thing is, I do have the money to pay for the repairs. I\u2019d have to take it out of mine and my wife\u2019s shared savings account (I actually already have with my wife\u2019s permission; I would put the money from Mike into that same savings account to restore the original amount). \n\nEven so, I told Lisa that Addie needs to have consequences for her actions, and if that means she has less money for college, then that\u2019s what that means. She meekly agreed and hung up. \n\nYesterday, I got a text from my sister. She basically called me a selfish asshole for taking money out of Addie\u2019s college fund over a stupid mistake. She said that I was being cruel, and that she knows I have the money, so I should just bite the bullet and let them keep the money. \n\nNow I\u2019m struggling with this dilemma, and I figured that I should get some unbiased perspective.

You're lucky it didn't seize the engine. You're niece broke it and she's got to fix it, if the funds come out of her college fund, oh well. She needs to pay attention and not damage other people's property.", "NTA the parents are responsible for their children\u2019s mistakes. They\u2019re the ones who didn\u2019t teach her that diesel fuel is different. \n\nShe\u2019s already proven to be an awful driver, and It\u2019s not on you to take a financial hit for their poor parenting.", "NTA.  You\u2019re totally in the right for your request.  That said, you could\u2019ve talked with your wife and seen if you could have reduced the penalty to your niece. Or you\nmight also consider a future college gift when she graduates from high school and you could\u2019ve talked those options with your brother and sister in law.\n\nThe fact that your sister jumped in expecting you to completely suck up the cost makes her the real a-hole in this situation.", "NTA. It's past time for her to learn to be careful with expensive things. If her mom doesn't want the money to come out of the kid's college fund, then Addie can get a job to pay it off.\n\nActually that would probably be better in the long run cause then she'll actually learn to value things.", "I would say that the biggest problem is that it seems like Addie has not been taught correctly about how to be responsible with cars. Kids do stupid stuff, but kids are more likely to do stupid stuff when they are not taught correctly by their parents. If she's that way with cars, she's probably that way with other aspects of her life. Again, given that she's 16, I would say that is her parents' fault for not teaching their daughter correctly.\n\nAddie should get a summer job to pay for that $1,500. Her parents obviously work and get by, so I doubt that they would be dependent on her income. Let her pay for it. Depending on how hard she works, you could cut her a break if she's a little short at the end of the summer, or you could make her pay every penny.\n\nIt shouldn't be coming out of her parents' pocket, your pocket or her college fund. She's 16 and can drive. She can work. 20 hours a week X 7.25 = $150. It would take her 10 weeks at a minimum wage job to pay you back. Assuming she works June and July, that would be around 8 weeks. It's still May - no excuse.", "NTA just b/c you have the means to cover it doesn\u2019t mean you should have to. Also, you shouldn\u2019t have given the car to her knowing how irresponsible she was with her own car. At the end of the day, her parents took that risk with someone else\u2019s property and should take care of the cost. They would not be able to pull this same card with someone who wasn\u2019t family.", "NTA-how do you even accidentally use diesel? She probably should not be driving a car unaccompanied.\n\nShe will just have to get student loans like everyone else\u2026", "\nNTA. She needs to learn that some mistakes have consequences. Even her mom agreed. If you feel really uncomfortable, maybe you can offer to pay $500 and let her pay $1000, but that's up to you. There is no need to feel obligated to do it.", "NTA. She is responsible for the damage. If the rest of the family feels like she shouldn't have to pay then ask them to all split the bill.", "You're NTA. You are absolutely right, Addie needs to be held accountable for her own careless mistake. But if this college fund issue is such a big deal, she can get... here it comes... a **job** and pay the money back.", "NTA. Addie or her parents need to cover the cost of her mistake, because that\u2019s what decent people do if they damage someone else\u2019s property. Also, if in the space of what seems like a few months Addie has totalled one car and caused significant damage to another through carelessness, maybe she needs*needs* to experience this natural consequence.   \n\n\nOP isn\u2019t being harsh or mean; he\u2019s not screaming at his niece or making her homeless over the repair. He\u2019s not demanding that the money come from Addie\u2019s college fund - that appears to be related to her parents\u2019 financial situation. OP even told his brother that the money didn\u2019t have to be paid back immediately. But the fact remains that OP did someone a favour, an$ shouldn\u2019t be out $1500 as a result, even if he can afford it.", ">She said that I was being cruel, and that she knows I have the money, so I should just bite the bullet and let them keep the money.\n\nShe knows you can spare the money? I think you should decide that she should spare the money. It's always fun to watch how generous people are with other people's things but not their own.\n\nI agree that Addy should have consequences but presumably this is an accident and not a situation where there was outright negligence or a criminal act like driving under the influence. \n\nPerhaps you and your other sister can network to help Abby connect with a good part time job that would look great on her applications or help her qualify for scholarships to supplement the meager college fund. Maybe she can take dual-credit classes during her last two years of high school and graduate with an AA already completed. Something like that might end up being more valuable than the money spent to repair the car.\n\nGood luck\n\nedited to add NTA", "NTA - however, I\u2019m not sure Addie will know where that money is coming from. So I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s going to suffer consequences truly. Some options would be to cover it for her parents and NEVER do them any more favors; make them pay now but then give Addie a sizeable graduation gift; not worry about it because had Addie been using anyone else\u2019s car her parents would have never assumed the owner would cover the charges; file an insurance claim; ask brother to file insurance claim; take care of it and never say another word about it nor accept money from them. \n\nObviously, it\u2019s your call. But you\u2019re NTA for expecting your borrowed property be returned in the same state it was borrowed in. \n\nAnd this is why they say to never lend anything to family.", "NTA. 16 is old enough to get a job in many places.

If your neice would have had consequences over wrecking her car she may have been more careful with yours.\n\n\nI would also like to mention how extremely hard it is to put diesel in a gasoline vehicle. The pump nose  is usually a red color plus the nose is too big for the hole.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re completely correct that money out of her college fund is a natural consequence for her actions. Even if it was an accident, it\u2019s still her responsibility. Also, it would be extremely disrespectful to your wife if you took that much money out of your joint savings account and didn\u2019t pay it back, especially if you already told her you would. \n\nLisa is also NTA for asking you, as it\u2019s clear that she just wants the best for her daughter.

Why isn't everyone offering to share in it?\n\nFor example - there are 3 of you.  You, Mike, your sister.  Why can't you each put up $500?  \n\nSo in effect, you cancel out $500 in debt.  Your sister puts up $500.  And either the college fund goes down by $500 (better than $1000), or Mike needs to come up with another $500?\n\nTo me - that's what I'd be looking for, compromise.\n\nBut you are absolutely NTA;  and your sister is TA for guilting you.", "INFO: If you have the money to foot the repairs and were willing to, why not have her work the debt off for you?
