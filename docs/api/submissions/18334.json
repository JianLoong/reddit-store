For her 16th birthday, Mike bought Addie a used, but still very nice, car. She totaled it two months later in an accident where she was 100% at fault, and Mike did not buy her another one.\n\nSo far, she\u2019s gotten by with Mike\u2019s car, but he recently had to take a business trip out of town, and was worried about her being home alone without a car. He asked me to lend her my car for a few days as a favor (my wife and I each have one, and it wouldn\u2019t be a major inconvenience to me). I reluctantly agreed. \n\nWhen it was time for me to take my car back, Mike told me that Addie had accidentally put diesel in it and that it had died in their driveway. I had it towed to a repair shop, and asked for $1500 (the amount quoted to my by the mechanic) from Mike to get it fixed. Mike told me that he would transfer the money soon, and I told him to take as much time as he needed. \n\nLater that afternoon, Mike\u2019s wife Lisa called me to tell me that the money for my car would be coming out of Addie\u2019s already meager college fund. She begged me to let the money go because Addie needs that money for college. She actually started crying, and I started feeling really bad. The thing is, I do have the money to pay for the repairs. I\u2019d have to take it out of mine and my wife\u2019s shared savings account (I actually already have with my wife\u2019s permission; I would put the money from Mike into that same savings account to restore the original amount). \n\nEven so, I told Lisa that Addie needs to have consequences for her actions, and if that means she has less money for college, then that\u2019s what that means. She meekly agreed and hung up. \n\nYesterday, I got a text from my sister. She basically called me a selfish asshole for taking money out of Addie\u2019s college fund over a stupid mistake. She said that I was being cruel, and that she knows I have the money, so I should just bite the bullet and let them keep the money. \n\nNow I\u2019m struggling with this dilemma, and I figured that I should get some unbiased perspective.

They\u2019re the ones who didn\u2019t teach her that diesel fuel is different. \n\nShe\u2019s already proven to be an awful driver, and It\u2019s not on you to take a financial hit for their poor parenting.", "NTA.  You\u2019re totally in the right for your request.  That said, you could\u2019ve talked with your wife and seen if you could have reduced the penalty to your niece. Or you\nmight also consider a future college gift when she graduates from high school and you could\u2019ve talked those options with your brother and sister in law.\n\nThe fact that your sister jumped in expecting you to completely suck up the cost makes her the real a-hole in this situation.", "NTA. It's past time for her to learn to be careful with expensive things. If her mom doesn't want the money to come out of the kid's college fund, then Addie can get a job to pay it off.\n\nActually that would probably be better in the long run cause then she'll actually learn to value things.", "I would say that the biggest problem is that it seems like Addie has not been taught correctly about how to be responsible with cars. Kids do stupid stuff, but kids are more likely to do stupid stuff when they are not taught correctly by their parents. If she's that way with cars, she's probably that way with other aspects of her life. Again, given that she's 16, I would say that is her parents' fault for not teaching their daughter correctly.\n\nAddie should get a summer job to pay for that $1,500. Her parents obviously work and get by, so I doubt that they would be dependent on her income. Let her pay for it. Depending on how hard she works, you could cut her a break if she's a little short at the end of the summer, or you could make her pay every penny.\n\nIt shouldn't be coming out of her parents' pocket, your pocket or her college fund. She's 16 and can drive. She can work. 20 hours a week X 7.25 = $150. It would take her 10 weeks at a minimum wage job to pay you back. Assuming she works June and July, that would be around 8 weeks. It's still May - no excuse.", "NTA just b/c you have the means to cover it doesn\u2019t mean you should have to. Also, you shouldn\u2019t have given the car to her knowing how irresponsible she was with her own car. At the end of the day, her parents took that risk with someone else\u2019s property and should take care of the cost. They would not be able to pull this same card with someone who wasn\u2019t family.", "NTA-how do you even accidentally use diesel? She probably should not be driving a car unaccompanied.\n\nShe will just have to get student loans like everyone else\u2026", "\nNTA. She needs to learn that some mistakes have consequences. Even her mom agreed. If you feel really uncomfortable, maybe you can offer to pay $500 and let her pay $1000, but that's up to you. There is no need to feel obligated to do it.", "NTA. She is responsible for the damage. If the rest of the family feels like she shouldn't have to pay then ask them to all split the bill.", "You're NTA.

Also, if in the space of what seems like a few months Addie has totalled one car and caused significant damage to another through carelessness, maybe she needs*needs* to experience this natural consequence.   \n\n\nOP isn\u2019t being harsh or mean; he\u2019s not screaming at his niece or making her homeless over the repair. He\u2019s not demanding that the money come from Addie\u2019s college fund - that appears to be related to her parents\u2019 financial situation. OP even told his brother that the money didn\u2019t have to be paid back immediately.

I think you should decide that she should spare the money. It's always fun to watch how generous people are with other people's things but not their own.\n\nI agree that Addy should have consequences but presumably this is an accident and not a situation where there was outright negligence or a criminal act like driving under the influence. \n\nPerhaps you and your other sister can network to help Abby connect with a good part time job that would look great on her applications or help her qualify for scholarships to supplement the meager college fund. Maybe she can take dual-credit classes during her last two years of high school and graduate with an AA already completed. Something like that might end up being more valuable than the money spent to repair the car.\n\nGood luck\n\nedited to add NTA", "NTA - however, I\u2019m not sure Addie will know where that money is coming from. So I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s going to suffer consequences truly. Some options would be to cover it for her parents and NEVER do them any more favors; make them pay now but then give Addie a sizeable graduation gift; not worry about it because had Addie been using anyone else\u2019s car her parents would have never assumed the owner would cover the charges; file an insurance claim; ask brother to file insurance claim; take care of it and never say another word about it nor accept money from them. \n\nObviously, it\u2019s your call.

The dealership couldn't figure out what the problem was and thought that replacing the whole screen might be the only solution, but being a new design and in the first year of use there wasn't really spare parts for it made by GM yet so they would have to see if they could possibly come directly from the manufacturing plant or something like that. Well top engineers and big wigs from GM wanted to inspect the vehicle personally and investigate so they were going to fly in and check it out, I'm assuming they were very interested in what was causing it for obvious reasons.\n\n\nBut in the meantime they gave her another one as a loaner new off the lot. Well my wife the next day had one of our daughters friends with her taking her to our house to visit and she asked her to pump some gas into the vehicle while she went into the store to get some drinks and she just swiped her card and walked away. After she got the drinks and came back out a few minutes later, the girl was in the car waiting for her. They were only about a mile away from the house and on the way there. I got a call from her saying that the new loaner vehicle was stuttering and stalling and she was a block away from the house. I went outside to go to where she was at and she was just making it to our driveway and the vehicle was obviously not running correctly. And I think what are the odds of getting two new vehicles that are having all these problems?\n\n\nAfter a short call to the dealership, several hours later a tow truck comes to retrieve the vehicle and the dealership brought another loaner vehicle to our residence, but not the same type and not brand new which was fine. A few weeks go by and the dealership call's me back for an update where they stand on repairs to her vehicle and they also mention the cause of the first loaner vehicle malfunction. The first loaner vehicle had gotten diesel fuel in the fuel tank and that was the cause of the problem. My mind went bonkers thinking about how could this have even happened when you can't even fit a diesel fuel fueling nozzle into an unleaded fuel receiver because it's supposed to be too big and how could my wife had been so careless and clueless when she's been pumping gas for years. Then my mind went into panic at what this mistake would even cost since this was most likely my wife's fault and the vehicle only had less than 20 miles on it.\n\n\nContinuing the conversation with the dealership they said the repairs were several thousand dollars and also would negatively affect the price of the vehicle's sale value. I asked them if there was any paperwork that my wife had signed when she received the loaner vehicle and what it says if she did and they went silent and said they'd get back to me. I asked my wife about it right away and she told me the story of how she wasn't the one that pumped the gas and she didn't watch the girl do it either. Obviously this was of no fault to the girl that pumped the gas, I don't believe she even had a learner's permit or much of any driving knowledge, but even if she did that wasn't a valid excuse. My wife also said she didn't sign any paperwork or even had much of a conversation with the dealership when she received the loaner vehicle.\n\n\nA few more weeks of sweating about the possible charges for all the damages they called me back to say that the vehicle we originally purchased had been thoroughly looked over by many people and that they did receive a replacement instrument display and installed it and it has tested thoroughly and the problem was fixed. The dealership never asked me anything more about the loaner vehicle that got the diesel fuel in it and I didn't ask either, but I'm assuming they went over it with their legal department and said it was on them for not having any written agreement on the loaner terms.\n\n\nI did ask the girl that pumped the diesel fuel into the vehicle out of curiosity of how she achieved it and she said that she had seen people pump gas a lot and just assumed that the nozzle didn't normally fit in the receiver once she tried and just put the end to the hole and pulled the trigger and kept stopping when diesel fuel would get close to overflowing and stopped after a few minutes when the level of diesel fuel didn't drain back into the tank. She also said she never spilled even a drop because she was worried about getting fuel on the brand new car. She wanted to act like she knew what she was doing so she wasn't embarrassed for not knowing how to pump gas so she just went with what she assumed she always witnessed. I laughed and gave her some tips on how it should normally work and it's actually not as complicated and a good learning experience for both her and my then wife.", "NTA It's summer.

If the dad didn't give her the option to get a job and is just taking it from the college fund he might be the asshole here. It depends on how that is handled behind the scenes.

The parents should pay for OP's car repairs, and then, if they want to, they can require that Addie get a job and repay them \u2013 or, if they don't have the money anywhere but in her college fund, they should take it, and require her to get a job to replenish the college fund. \n\nAside from that, if Addie's college fund is as meager as her mother says, I doubt that sunstracting $1,500 will make that much of a difference; the fund is clearly not substantial enough to cover much, so she's obviously going to have to take out loans anyway, and an extra $1,500 in student loans isn't really that much in the grand scheme of things.", "There we go.
