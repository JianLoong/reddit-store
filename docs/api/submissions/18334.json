For her 16th birthday, Mike bought Addie a used, but still very nice, car. She totaled it two months later in an accident where she was 100% at fault, and Mike did not buy her another one.\n\nSo far, she\u2019s gotten by with Mike\u2019s car, but he recently had to take a business trip out of town, and was worried about her being home alone without a car. He asked me to lend her my car for a few days as a favor (my wife and I each have one, and it wouldn\u2019t be a major inconvenience to me). I reluctantly agreed. \n\nWhen it was time for me to take my car back, Mike told me that Addie had accidentally put diesel in it and that it had died in their driveway. I had it towed to a repair shop, and asked for $1500 (the amount quoted to my by the mechanic) from Mike to get it fixed. Mike told me that he would transfer the money soon, and I told him to take as much time as he needed. \n\nLater that afternoon, Mike\u2019s wife Lisa called me to tell me that the money for my car would be coming out of Addie\u2019s already meager college fund. She begged me to let the money go because Addie needs that money for college. She actually started crying, and I started feeling really bad. The thing is, I do have the money to pay for the repairs. I\u2019d have to take it out of mine and my wife\u2019s shared savings account (I actually already have with my wife\u2019s permission; I would put the money from Mike into that same savings account to restore the original amount). \n\nEven so, I told Lisa that Addie needs to have consequences for her actions, and if that means she has less money for college, then that\u2019s what that means. She meekly agreed and hung up. \n\nYesterday, I got a text from my sister. She basically called me a selfish asshole for taking money out of Addie\u2019s college fund over a stupid mistake. She said that I was being cruel, and that she knows I have the money, so I should just bite the bullet and let them keep the money. \n\nNow I\u2019m struggling with this dilemma, and I figured that I should get some unbiased perspective.

She needs to pay attention and not damage other people's property.", "NTA the parents are responsible for their children\u2019s mistakes. They\u2019re the ones who didn\u2019t teach her that diesel fuel is different. \n\nShe\u2019s already proven to be an awful driver, and It\u2019s not on you to take a financial hit for their poor parenting.", "NTA.  You\u2019re totally in the right for your request.  That said, you could\u2019ve talked with your wife and seen if you could have reduced the penalty to your niece. Or you\nmight also consider a future college gift when she graduates from high school and you could\u2019ve talked those options with your brother and sister in law.\n\nThe fact that your sister jumped in expecting you to completely suck up the cost makes her the real a-hole in this situation.", "NTA. It's past time for her to learn to be careful with expensive things. If her mom doesn't want the money to come out of the kid's college fund, then Addie can get a job to pay it off.\n\nActually that would probably be better in the long run cause then she'll actually learn to value things.", "I would say that the biggest problem is that it seems like Addie has not been taught correctly about how to be responsible with cars. Kids do stupid stuff, but kids are more likely to do stupid stuff when they are not taught correctly by their parents. If she's that way with cars, she's probably that way with other aspects of her life. Again, given that she's 16, I would say that is her parents' fault for not teaching their daughter correctly.\n\nAddie should get a summer job to pay for that $1,500. Her parents obviously work and get by, so I doubt that they would be dependent on her income. Let her pay for it. Depending on how hard she works, you could cut her a break if she's a little short at the end of the summer, or you could make her pay every penny.\n\nIt shouldn't be coming out of her parents' pocket, your pocket or her college fund. She's 16 and can drive. She can work. 20 hours a week X 7.25 = $150. It would take her 10 weeks at a minimum wage job to pay you back. Assuming she works June and July, that would be around 8 weeks. It's still May - no excuse.", "NTA just b/c you have the means to cover it doesn\u2019t mean you should have to. Also, you shouldn\u2019t have given the car to her knowing how irresponsible she was with her own car. At the end of the day, her parents took that risk with someone else\u2019s property and should take care of the cost.

She probably should not be driving a car unaccompanied.\n\nShe will just have to get student loans like everyone else\u2026", "\nNTA. She needs to learn that some mistakes have consequences.

He\u2019s not demanding that the money come from Addie\u2019s college fund - that appears to be related to her parents\u2019 financial situation.

I think you should decide that she should spare the money. It's always fun to watch how generous people are with other people's things but not their own.\n\nI agree that Addy should have consequences but presumably this is an accident and not a situation where there was outright negligence or a criminal act like driving under the influence. \n\nPerhaps you and your other sister can network to help Abby connect with a good part time job that would look great on her applications or help her qualify for scholarships to supplement the meager college fund.

Although I can't say I'm surprised that Abbie doesn't have great decision-making skills. Consider the people who raised her:\n\n>For her 16th birthday, Mike bought Addie a used, but still very nice, car.\n\nMeanwhile, Addie's college fund is \"meager.\" Buying her a \"very nice\" used car instead of putting that money in the college fund was a decision.

But it sounds like there was an opportunity to buy a less expensive used car and boost that college fund, and that opportunity was missed. \n\nNTA. I feel like this should be a wake-up call for Abbie's parents that they are failing at parenting on multiple fronts. They need to go back to square one with the driver's ed, and rethink their financial priorities in general. They are also teaching their daughter that life is a consequence-free zone.
