I usually go for the cheaper practical items like a car mirror for the back seat for when the baby has to be facing away from the front seat and other various bottle/pump accessories. They don\u2019t seem like very personal gifts, but often the most useful.

My favorite being my baby would starve if I didn't ask for the suggested 20 or so bottles on the list, and my little end up not liking either of the 3pk brands I did choose.  \nOn the flipside, I did get a little annoyed with a few people who went to town with what they thought I would need. (I got 3 diaper genies and I didn't even want one, all I could think was poop sausages, no thanks.) My aunt went so far as to say if I had just put it on the registry there wouldn't have been duplicates, then cried on a visit when she found out I returned them all into gift cards, then used the gift cards to get the things we really ended up needing as we came upon it. \nReally, half the items you don't use long, or is just too much to ask someone to buy for you.

If someone is receiving a gift that is absolutely free especially for baby showers where a gift is not even given in return it would be polite for the person who received it to say thank you and then they can either donate it to someone in need or return the item if a gift receipt is given. I always add gift receipts to items and what the person does with it when they receive it is up to them, but I've never had someone scold me for getting the wrong free gift. If someone scolded me for buying the wrong gift I would simply ask for said gift back since they are ungrateful and don't want it, so I can get my money back or donate it to someone who would be happy to use the item. \n\nI received plenty of stuff over the years that I already had or I don't really need, but never in a millions years would I ever tell the person I didn't like it and they should have bought me something else. Why make someone feel like shit when they put thought, effort, and money into the gift for me? I say thank you and I appreciate the gift. They didn't have to get me anything and could have used that money on themselves, but they choose to spend it on a gift for someone else which is worth more than anything no matter what the item is. OP's sister is TA for being ungrateful about the gift OP gave. The sister could have just as easily said thank you and left it as that.", "Why? It's not a catalog, but a list of \"gimme, please.\"\n\nThere's nothing wrong with gifts from the heart.", "People who have a changing pad", "Yeah which is why you get a multi pack and not a couple monogrammed ones that the baby will quickly grow out of.\n\nAlso not everyone wants a changing pad to lug around and its possible they already have one. Hence the registry with what they wanted/needed.", "They are not only an American thing. E.g. wedding registries are very common in most Western countries. It's considerate for both the recipient and the giver: helps the newly-weds / new parents get essential, useful items; and makes gift decisions easier for the gifter.", "In the case of a baby registry, I completely understand it\u2026the mom-to-be is about to have a major life change, and babies need a ton of stuff. The registry the mom\u2019s way of letting you know what she and the baby need and what would be most helpful.", "Gift lifts in general are a whole other thing but for weddings and especially baby showers they DO serve a very specific purpose. For American weddings, gifts  are meant to be something to help the new couple start their home together. The registry was so the couple could not only communicate what items they still need for their home, but guests don\u2019t have to guess what color and pattern towels the couple would like. This has somewhat changed now that the average couple is getting married a little older, often has lived outside their parents home already, and often have already been living with their new spouse so they have silverware and towels and a toaster.  Now, often registries are more home items that are either nicer versions of what the couple already has (for example a matching set of nice drinking glasses instead of miscellaneous old cups they have had since college). Or are things like nice serverware, which is hard to justify buying for yourself, but very nice to have especially if you are having people over for dinner.\n\nNow for baby showers specifically, it\u2019s still more of my first example of items NEEDED, and the gifts are a bigger deal. Generally baby showers are for a woman\u2019s first baby, and while it is general celebration of her pregnancy, the point is to \u201cshower\u201d them with what they\u2019ll need as a new mom. As opposed to a wedding where the point is to witness and celebrate a new marriage and gifts are generally expected but not the actual point of the gathering.\n\nOften by the time of the baby shower, the pregnant woman will have purchased some items already,  will have gotten some gifted or loaned from family and friends, etc.  So the registry helps to direct people and say, \u201cI already have a stroller but a diaper pail is still needed!\u201d.   Everybody wants to buy cute baby clothes, but babies grow out of them in an instant. I have a friend who had a large baby shower and they had to buy a bigger dresser to hold the dozens of teeny outfits people brought. Which, whatever, they were gifts, but in that case were often given in addition to an item from the registry.\n\nSo while OP was well meaning, the fact that she chose to spend her very limited gift funds on a custom outfit instead of diapers or something the sister actually needs and asked for is frustrating.  I wouldn\u2019t go as far to say she\u2019s an asshole, I think she\u2019s just naiive.  The sister being frustrated is understandable but she handled it in a rude and unnecessary way.  The gift was given, it doesn\u2019t hurt anybody it\u2019s just not particularly helpful, what\u2019s done is done, you can privately roll your eyes and then be polite and thank OP for the gift and move on.", "Because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll get stupid problems like unwrapping 9 different toaster ovens.", "Different registries serve different purposes.  Baby registries have become very popular for practical reasons. \n1. It cuts down on everyone asking the parents what they need. I come from a large family and by the time my youngest sister came around there wasn't really anything baby related she did not have but there would still be people trying to gift her items she had no use for. No one needs 5 diaper bags.\n2. Depending on the registry there are some that allow a group to pool money online for a big purchase. I've done with with coworkers for things like strollers and baby monitors. Things that are practical but not necessarily that it is nice to help out on.", "Because there so many different options on baby items. Parents have preferences and it allows people to buy stuff the parents would actually use.", "This American (me) has always believed that registries were like wish lists, not obligatory purchase lists. OP got a sweet and thoughtful gift. Too bad her sister doesn't find the meaning in her gift.", "I was bullied into having one for my wedding. People wanted to give us stuff, and wanted it to be things we actually wanted/needed.", "I'm in Canada and we have this, too. From my understanding, they're usually wish lists\n\nThe best baby shower I ever went to, the couple only asked everyone for diapers lol", "Is the same with people expecting money as wedding gifts, for me that's pretty much as selling the entry ticket for your party. Too vulgar", "Depends on the parent.  I was inundated with offers of bags of clothing because so many people got 0-3 that their kids didn't even get a chance to wear.", "We wasted so much money on clothes. My Daughter is now 11 months and is just now getting through some of her bigger ones. We aren't far off Winter here so it's just more clothes we will have to buy soon. You can definitely have too many.", "Exactly!  A new parent can never have too many onesies.", "What exactly is the point of giving a gift that the recipient neither wants nor needs, but YOU wanted to give them? What's the end-game? To make YOURSELF feel fuzzy inside? Cause that's not really the point of everyone coming together to support a new parent.", "You should, however, be purchasing a gift the giftee will like. Not something you like or think is cute. It\u2019s a perennial problem. I always appreciate gifts. I would never yell at someone for not giving me a registry gift, but I might be frustrated if it were something I wouldn\u2019t wear on the baby, wasn\u2019t practical, if I didn\u2019t want to advertise their name on their body (dangerous, to some degree). Gifts aren\u2019t for the person who buys the gift. Gift buying and giving doesn\u2019t exist to strike your ego.  It\u2019s an expression of friendship or joy and should be uniquely focused on the gift receiver. If you\u2019re great at choosing gifts that the receive loves, then choose them. If you\u2019re not, registries and wish lists make sense. There is no point in making a gift recipient feel guilty that you spent money (or time) on a gift that they will never use. \n\nAs for OP, I think it was rude of your sis to call you out. I can\u2019t decide on a judgment, because I actually do like registries and wish lists. It means I can buy people things they really want and will be useful. Now, if there was nothing on the list that was in your budget, I think the better option is to ask for more budget-conscious items to be added to the registry.", "The sister was not gracious and that is unacceptable. Although, as such a close relative, it would have been great if OP could have chosen a gift that would have been better received, even if it wasn't on the registry. What concerns me more is that OP's sister seems to need things so badly that she's already in a sour mood about it. Having the baby is just the tip of the iceberg. If you can't comfortably provide for the child from the get-go, what will happen as time goes on? Kids only get more expensive as they grow.", "NTA - agree totally. A registry is meant to be a helpful guide for gift givers, not a command station. Sheesh.", "I highly doubt if she can return PERSONALIZED onesies. That's actually part of the point of a registry: you can return gifts you've registered for to the store if you get too many or you decide that you don't need something after all. Off-registry gifts, especially things like personalized ANYTHING, are often not returnable even if they're the wrong size or not needed. Which is one of the many, many reasons why you should always buy off someone's registry: because it makes life easier for the recipient, who is supposed to be the person you're thinking of and celebrating.", "And OP should know that about her sister and shopped accordingly.", "THIS. When I got married we had a registry. The few people who went off registry got us things that were spot on 'us' and we were delighted.\n\n A gift is a gift, and your sister will find that yours were both thoughtful and needed. NTA.", "No way. They're a suggestion only and a guide as to things they are looking for. Nobody is obligated to buy off it.\n\nMy favourite gifts ended up being custom/hand made items as well as things we hadn't realized we wanted. Experienced moms gave us the most useful things they had and they were *lifesavers*.", "What a terrible analogy!", "Why? If sister can't get her own baby stuff for her own baby, she shouldn't be having a baby.", "Not even the same damn thing.", "Onesies aren\u2019t useful?!", "Right, like, I assume onesies are on the registry because that's what newborns wear. But OP got custom onesies that weren't on the registry, but better. Or OP's sister is clueless and doesn't realize the power of onesies. NtA", "The lack of graciousness for people who give ANY gift is appalling and gross. Registries are not a required guideline someone MUST follow. When someone gives you a gift, you say thank you and appreciate their gesture.", "How about being grateful for anything at all??", "And yet they could afford a custom made onesie, which the mother to be could not return if she didn't like it.", "The sister should have kept her mouth shut and be grateful. Is incredible how entitled are some people", "What? When you receive a gift, you smile, say that you love it and thank the gift giver. No matter what, no excuses, no other course of action.  Only exception is if the gift is something offensive or illegal. Same when someone cooks for you. \n\nNTA. Take the stuff back and get a refund. Don't ever waste any money in gifts for someone that don't appreciate it.", "Wrong. Registries are suggestions.", "You forgot the S/", "I'm with you here because I just helped with my BFF'S baby shower. Frankly, baby gifts are a whole different ballpark. She's not \"ungrateful\" over a birthday gift or wedding - each item on a registry serves a specific purpose to streamline tasks or take something off the parent's mental load.\n\nThe whole goal of a baby shower is to empower that new parent and help provide the **tools** they need for a baby. I think it's kinda a dick move to decide that you know they need better than they do.\n\nYTA", "But YTA? Really? Surely at worst this would be an NAH or an ESH at worst. I mean, she still bought a gift that was thoughtful and minorly useful? And surely if you receive a gift, even if it's not what you want most of all, you should be thankful (instead of going off at the gift giver)?", "Hhahahaha your level of entitlement is astonishing.", "What's more considerate than a gift from the heart?", ">the registry is likely to contain things they absolutely need and perhaps can't afford to buy.\n\nThen they shouldn't be having a baby.", "Registries aren\u2019t tacky at all. They are incredibly practical. \n\nIt avoids a variety of realistic problems like five different people showing up and giving you five different toaster ovens. It also takes the guesswork out of things by people telling their guests what would be useful or helpful to them.\n\nFinally, it avoids another problem. Which is that gift giving is actually kind of difficult to do right. Particularly in terms of matters where personal taste or preferences are involved. Unless you really, really know someone preferences\u2014which is something people tend to *wildly* overestimate their ability at\u2014you\u2019re probably going to get them something they just flatly don\u2019t want and they get absolutely nothing out of. All the while, you could have just very simply picked something off the registry. \n\nSo in short registries exist because if you don\u2019t have one, you\u2019re likely going to get a ton of duplicate gifts, not get a lot of the things you actually needed/wanted, and get a lot of just junk that you\u2019re going to end up storing somewhere until it\u2019s socially acceptable to either donate it or throw it in the trash.", "To add on to Queso\u2019s great points, showers aren\u2019t supposed to be about expectations of other people providing for your new child. They\u2019re your friends and family caring about you and wanting to celebrate the massive life change, often wanting to *shower* you with gifts (sometimes annoyingly so at least in my experience). If someone\u2019s unwilling or unable to join in the gift giving, that\u2019s perfectly fine too. \n\nOP is NTA though.", "Yes, take back the *incredibly useful* personalized onsies, and do what with them?", "Found the sister.", "They may have been re gifts then?

I got my very close friend a subscription for 3 months of the brand she had listed on the registry. That was obviously not a cheaper end gift, but my friend said it was more helpful than she realized it would be because the diapers were just delivered to their house on time and they never worried about running out for some while they were exhausted. I also helped her set up her own account after my subscription ended.\n\nEdit: typo", "I was.  It was an unnecessary hassle.  I was also polite and thankful to the people who gave them.", "I\u2019ve never seen a registry that didn\u2019t have some diapers!", "It really depends what's on the registry. They might not have had changing mats and onesies on it because they already had those things.

It's difficult to judge this one without knowing what the registry looks like.", "Tbh if they got a vacuum cleaner surely they could\u2019ve afforded something on the registry. In general, it\u2019s a good idea for people to have a range of prices, & usually there\u2019s a gift card option as well. It would be rude to have only expensive stuff on your registry and then be mad some people couldn\u2019t splurge.", "Is this some bizarre American thing? I can\u2019t imagine the average mother getting annoyed at any gifts here.", "Exactly! This is spot on. Someone could have regifted something or got a deal on something. Not only are people losing compassion they are losing gratefulness.", "Hmm most people would have things on it that are pretty affordable. My friend who just had a baby shower had tons of stuff, everything ranging from 10-500 dollars.", "Custom made onesies aren't exactly cheap", "I'm so confused.

That is rudeness and entitlement on a level that rises to insanity.\n\n And if you have so much stuff from a first shower, skip the second shower.

Nobody is entitled to getting a gift, and demanding that someone \u201cdo it right\u201d is gross. You aren\u2019t entitled to receive a give that is exactly what you want. If you can\u2019t handle that you would not get a gift that did not match your tastes, maybe just not accept gifts at all.", "I feel like the sister would have a lot more to say", "I agree. The critical piece of info is the price of the registry items. I asked that in another comment. If you can\u2019t afford anything on the registry then obviously you shouldn\u2019t overextend yourself to adhere to it. Every baby registry I\u2019ve seen (and the one I made) had plenty of items between $5-10 so that\u2019s the part that gets me here.", "Not splurge on custom-made onesies?", "Your sister is rude. You were worried about your gift. And in fact, your mother is a bit AH, too, for telling you that and enabling your sister's bad behavior.", "Like all baby clothes. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not useful. She\u2019ll need them in all sizes.", "That\u2019s why I never gift baby clothes. I\u2019ll gift something they can wear after they\u2019re 6mos-1yr, and I gift something for the mom to use for self care.", "That\u2019s why I always gift things that in the 6 month old range. Something that can be layered if it\u2019s going to be cooler or worn on its own if it\u2019s warmer. I\u2019ve had first time parents wonder why I didn\u2019t give cutesy newborn outfits and then come back and say they got it now. It was some they didn\u2019t have to buy later on.", "With the way the sister reacted to getting something not on the approved list, there's no way she's buying second hand clothes.", "Also, depending on the season the baby is born, and wheather the onesies have short or long sleeves, the baby might not even get to use them. I know it sounds silly but if you don't have kids you might not even think on it.", "My SIL donated bags of baby clothes, some with the tags still on them, because everyone did this and her daughter out grew them before she even used them.", "This is exactly why I was always told to get onesies for older sizes and avoid the first months when gifting for a baby.", "Generally the parents have to buy what their baby needs regardless. It's nice if others help, but if you can't provide for your baby, don't have one. If you can't be grateful for a change pad and some cute onesies from the *baby's aunt*, you need to check yourself.", "Exactly it\u2019s kinda like when the golf-obsessed husband gives his non-golfer wife golf clubs for her birthday. It\u2019s tone deaf.", "Nonsense. Nonsense on stilts. A registry is a list of \"gimme, please.\"\n\nAnd, for all we know, there may have been no items left on the registry that OP could afford, if there were any to start with.", "I mean, to be fair, the entire point of a shower is for people to buy you gifts, and the entire point of a registry is for people to know what to get you.", "If you\u2019d like to take issue with the idea that someone is expected to buy someone a gift because they\u2019re having a baby, that\u2019s a bit of a different debate. \n\nBut what\u2019s the point of gift giving?  It is to give someone something they are going to like/want/enjoy. \n\nLet\u2019s think about the stereotypical bad gift giver. A golf-mad husband married to a wife who is a bookworm who isn\u2019t into golf or sports. Instead of getting her books, he gets her golf clubs for her birthday. I think we can agree that the husband did a shabby job there because he bought for his preferences and not his wife\u2019s. \n\nNow, not everyone is going to necessarily be able to know exactly what the recipient wants or needs since it\u2019s a pretty personal thing and as mentioned, you don\u2019t want them to get nine different toaster ovens and three vacuums. So, it makes a hell of a lot of sense for them to post a list of what is actually helpful. \n\nAgain, I can see the point of someone saying \u201cwhy am I automatically expected to get someone a gift because they done got knocked up?\u201d There may be a real discussion there. \n\nHowever if you are going to get someone a gift, you should get them something that\u2019s wanted and useful, and the registry is a really, really practical tool in that regard.", "It\u2019s not thoughtful though. Thoughtful would have been recognising that OP\u2019s sister is very practically minded and would prefer gifts that reflect that.", "My kids were both 10-pounders, so they had already outgrown 0-3mo clothes before they were even born!  I always give 3-6mo or even 6-9mo sizes as shower gifts now.  They might not fit a newborn, but babies grow so quickly that they'll be needed pretty soon. Better to have to wait to wear it than to never be able to wear it at all.", "Oh, what a terrible problem to have. The burden of privilege.", "As if you can\u2019t use bright pink things for boys \u2026", "Why would you assume you'd get a baby shower for a second baby? It's usually for first-time mother's/parents.\n\nI also got a \"hippie\" wrap I didn't register for and it was the best thing ever. The bottles, pacifiers, and baby bullet I picked out turned out to be useless because neither of my babies would take them. Not everything is going to be a winner but you don't know that until the baby actually arrives and tries them.", "Like you said, it's to help, not a demand. If someone is having a child, they should hopefully be able to get most of the things they'll need anyway, a registry is just to help them out if possible.\n\nAnd I have seen plenty of people put expensive things on a registry, that the average person can't afford. So we really don't know if there was anything OP could afford on there. And even with her financial issues she still tried to get her something useful. And what baby doesn't need clothes?\n\nAnd the analogy with the dog doesn't work. If my dog needed medicine, it'd still be my responsibility to pay for it. But someone out right agreeing to get meds for my dog, is different than someone asking me to get something for their baby.", "That's stupid. Don't have babies if you have to crowdfund supplies for them, and can't behave better than a toddler when you don't get what you want.", "the dirty ruined easily is why i gave a friend 110 varying up to 9m. she loved them. i also gave her the laundry baskets she wanted and some other items too.\n\nshe doesn't have a washer/dryer as they have to pay to do laundry. needless to say the stress of being able to toss a disgusting onesie was amazing for her. she was worried about laundry costs because she always heard how much laundry babies make.", "Of course, but the recipeient doesn't have to be rude about it.", "OP said they don\u2019t have much money.", "Which is entitled thought.", "My shower is tomorrow and I\u2019m dreading all of the extra items I\u2019m going to get. It just leads to us having to arrange time to donate/return/sell when I\u2019m heavily pregnant and not in the shape to be doing that! Fortunately for me most of my registry was purchased, but I added nothing over $100 and most items were way under that. I\u2019m definitely going to get items that I\u2019ll be getting rid of, no matter how clear I was on receiving no clothes or toys.", "And if everything in OP's budget was gone (assuming there were any)?", "Ah, so you're in the right to tell someone who gives you a gift you didn't register to fuck right off, that their gift is useless and then walk away? \n\nI was always taught to accept gifts graciously even if they're not what you would've picked - but I guess I'm old fashioned like that.  Being *hostile* to someone giving you a gift seems to me like the height of self-entitlement - OP, I would be not giving your sister any more gifts, full stop, on any occasion, as it's clear all she really wants is cash in acceptable denominations, and I'd wager my own money someone who responds this way to *any* gift doesn't actually appreciate even those.", "If a husband gives a housewife a new vacuum for her birthday, do you think she owes him gratitude and thanks for that too?  I\u2019d say he\u2019s an insensitive oaf. \n\nOP\u2019s sister outright said what would be helpful to her. But no, no, no!! OP knew better. Instead of getting something helpful to her sister which would have taken *no effort* because it was spelled out exactly for her, she got a gift to her tastes instead. \n\nIf you\u2019re so indifferent about actually getting a gift recipient what they want, maybe you\u2019re the one who shouldn\u2019t be giving gifts.", "I am a sister and have a sister. This response is exactly what a sister would say lmao", "That\u2019s what confused me too because that seems more expensive than many useful gifts. I hope the OP answers about the price of the registry items. I\u2019m wondering if she thought the gifts she could afford weren\u2019t fun enough and that\u2019s why she did what she did. If that\u2019s the case I can see the sister being hurt, even though that\u2019s never an excuse for the sister to be rude. \n\nAt the most recent shower I went to I gifted postpartum care items from the registry like witch hazel pads. Really not fun or cute\u2026but I know how much I needed those things and I really want her to have the same comforts I did. If nobody buys those things off the registry she might just go without. I put her needs before the desire to have a cute gift.", "We have no idea on the cost of those onesies, FFS, the OP is the aunt. She probably wanted to give something more special and meaningful than some stupid bottle cleaner or diapers.", "You either responded to the wrong person, or you\u2019re one of those fun new comment stealing bots", "Of course, but that is why you don\u2019t spend money custom monogramming those items.", "People tend to buy baby clothes in newborn or infant sizes though. Even if they buy clothes for other stages, a lot of times clothes aren\u2019t season-appropriate by the time the baby is big enough to wear them.", "She didn't react to the gift bc it wasn't on the approved list, but bc it wasn't useful for her. Whatever that means", "I think you totally don\u2019t understand the point of neither gifts nor baby showers. \n\nThe point of a gift is to get the recipient something useful or that they would enjoy. Like for example, giving a book lover books. An example of a bad gift would be a golf-mad husband giving a his bookworm wife who has no interest in golf a set of golf clubs. See how that works?\n\nA baby shower is not intended as some kind of emergency intervention thing only intended to apply to impoverished mothers who can\u2019t afford a kid. It is intended to help them along their way of parenthood and a celebration. \n\nPart of the custom is baby related gifts. So remember the little lesson on gift giving\u2014you get people things based on *their* wants and preference and not yours?  Still applies!!  \n\nSo here, OP was to get a gift. Her sister posted a goddamn list of things that would be helpful. But instead of saying \u201chey this stuff would help her out.\u201d She says \u201caha! I know my sister\u2019s tastes better than she does. I think these onesies are cute.\u201d No bueno.", "It is not the same thing! What a terrible comparison.", "Personalized onesies aren't usually cheap and then add on a changing pad.  Most people have wipes, diapers, so many relatively  cheap items.", "That\u2019s clearly not how sister and mom see it, or me either frankly. It\u2019s not always gimme please. In this case it\u2019s clearly this is stuff I\u2019m missing if you want to help me get me something from here.", "Looking at this from a different way again i can see how if you are the person giving the gift and have already decided you are the registry could be a good thing for the reason discussed that they will get something useful that they actually need. I dont object to registries if the giver calls upon them.\n\nThe thought I was having and dont like is if someone was having a baby and then said \"These are the gifts i want\" without being asked or anything", "I would rather have no gifts than gifts immediately headed to the landfill.", "I DIDN'T assume I would get a second shower, which is why I registered for neutral colors, which everyone ignored.", "I hear you. OP doesn\u2019t mention they went to the registry and all they saw were expensive strollers and designer booties. Maybe sister needed diapers, not customized onesies and a second changing pad. And I only used the dog example because OP used her dog as something they care about.", "Tell me you have no strong relationship/connections in your life without saying so. Baby showers are pretty normal. It\u2019s not that they can\u2019t afford this stuff. It gives ppl an excuse to celebrate and do nice things for each other.", "Please don't reproduce", "But they didn\u2019t say whether the things on the registry weren\u2019t in their price range. \n\nIf that was really the case, then that\u2019s a good and fair reason to deviate from the registry and I would say so long as they gave a good faith effort at getting something she believed her sister would like and nothing on the registry were financially in her range, then she\u2019d be in the clear.", "Such a burden to have people give you gifts. \ud83d\ude44", "Now that would be a horse of a different color. \n\nIf it was the case that there wasn\u2019t anything available\u2014either due to price constraints, things being sold out or otherwise\u2014then OP just has to do her best and if it goes wrong, it is what is and she would not be to blame.", "Get a package of diapers or wipes then. They cost $5-20.", "You know what?  Yes. \n\nBecause most of the time, when someone goes off registry and gets something they think is some \u201cunique\u201d gift that is off registry, it usually ends up being some white elephant to the recipient. They don\u2019t want it, but due to social pressure they have to thank them for it, pretend to like it, and then keep it for some appreciable length of time as just clutter somewhere in a garage, attic or closet. It does them no favors and usually just ends up being an imposition. \n\nMeanwhile they could have actually gotten something helpful.  Just get something off the goddamn registry?\n\nCan we talk about that?  Absent things being unavailable or out of someone\u2019s price range\u2014*why not just buy off the goddamn registry*?  Why??!?!?", "If nobody buys those things off the registry then buy them your damn self.", "So she gave a nice expensive box-filler instead. Great.", "That account is a year old and has two posts, both within the last hour, so yeah.\n\nNot saying you can\u2019t lurk, read, and only infrequently participate - but this is quacking like a duck.", "A special keepsake from auntie? That won\u2019t take up a lot of room? Yeah. Terrible idea.", "Getting a monogram on something is not always expensive. I got this same thing for my nephew and they just charged me $10 to do it on 3 onesies. My sister would put them on him when going to see older relatives so they wouldn't keep asking his name.", "It\u2019s adorable for the 2 weeks it fits. That\u2019s all it was meant to be.", "I got things in multiple sizes. I didn\u2019t even have to buy much at all for my oldest for the first year and a half. And everything was put away for the next kid.", "Yes it is. It exactly is! \n\nOP\u2019s sister gave a goddamn list in plain English of what would be helpful to her. What does OP do?  \n\nShe says no, no, no!  I do not care!  I find these onesies cute. I will substitute my own preferences and likes and disregard yours. Because I know better!", "You have no idea how much those onesies were.", "And they're often checked off quickly.", "Baby registries often come with coupons or freebies when you make them. Most of the moms I know who made a registry did so because they would get a freebie and a discount on the remaining unpurchased items. I had registries at like 4 different places so I could get the freebies and discounts on the things I needed. When my baby shower was planned (which, usually not planned by the parents to be) the host asked for my registry so she could include it in the invitations. Before the baby shower was planned most of my family asked for my registry to know what to get. This is the reality for 90% of parents who have baby registries and it is only this sub who thinks it\u2019s weird to have them.", "Well, if you\u2019re not getting someone gifts they want, I query what the point is. Why ignore the gifts people want and get them shit they don\u2019t want?", "You suspected you wouldn't but thought you might? Just a weird thing to throw in there.\n\nAnyways, be grateful for gifts people lovingly choose for your baby", "And, if the sister was just asking for diapers or similar items, I totally understand getting upset. They tend to be more affordable,(at least if you're not the one having to buy them constantly). And it'd be a slap in the face for someone to get you something off the registry instead of a pack of diapers", "Please stop crowdfunding dumb choices.", "I admit - \u201ccustom made onesies\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly sound cheap.", "Haha right? This comment thread is weird af.", "Which would probably no longer be on the registry, having been checked off quickly.", "Fair enough.  In your view, naked hostility to someone giving you a gift off registry is acceptable.  I've never gone off registry personally but I still don't agree this is worth actually being hostile to the giver, and would never expect such a person to give me anything again under any circumstances, but differences of opinion are what this forum is for.  Cheers.", "As keepsakes go, it\u2019s an unfortunately pretty disposable one. Some kids are born too big for the smallest size so it might get zero use. It\u2019s not returnable. It has a high likelihood of getting stained or ripped. I don\u2019t think this is E S H at all because the sister is being ungracious. But it\u2019s a shower gift with a lot of downsides.", "It\u2019s gonna end up in a box forever. What use is a keepsake that can\u2019t be used or displayed?

And you missed the point. With what she ended up probably spending to get customized embroidered onesies (which raises the cost)  and a cover, she could have even afforded a more expensive gift.", "Some women do get subsequent showers, yes. My SIL got one for her third child. It's not out of the realm of possibility.", "My first thought too! And I'm very careful about my kid's name in public, I would NEVER have them wear clothing out and about with their name on it, so those onesies would be a nightmare gift for me (they'd be worn at home and probably puke stained in a week).", "I would be happy to receive nothing lol. Im having a shower because friends and family wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. I would never EXPECT anyone to ever buy me anything, I was asked by a handful of people to make a registry.", "imo it's a well known fact that babies go through a ton of diapers and wipes even in just a few months. parents can never have too many.", "I think if you must go off registry, getting something consumable is best. Diapers (size 1) would be the safest bet if you want to get something tangible. Otherwise cash or gift card (or the more new age thing of contributing to a diaper fund).\n\nIf getting clothes is simply too irresistible, at least get a bigger size (taking weather into account).", "I can see where you\u2019re coming from as well. It\u2019s definitely a breach of expected social customs to go the sister\u2019s way. But I\u2019ve been in similar situations and find it frustrating. \n\nI\u2019m also someone who takes pride in being a good gift giver. Something I learned the hard way is that you\u2019ve got to put yourself aside and really listen to what they like and in a lot of cases people will actually tell you exactly what that is. If you just bulldoze over that, you just end up with a very wasteful situation where you\u2019re giving or receiving a lot of white elephants. Which is particularly frustrating when someone outright says in the Queen\u2019s (I guess King\u2019s now\u2026) English exactly what they want and ignore it. \n\nSo you\u2019re not wrong my friend. Objectively, yeah it is rude. This story just hits a little bit of a nerve with me. Have a good night and thanks for the good debate.", "Your Google Fu is weak. You can find a set of 4 custom embroidered onesies for 14 bucks, and not much more for a changing pad"]}
