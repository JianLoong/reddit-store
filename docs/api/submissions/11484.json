I usually go for the cheaper practical items like a car mirror for the back seat for when the baby has to be facing away from the front seat and other various bottle/pump accessories. They don\u2019t seem like very personal gifts, but often the most useful.

My favorite being my baby would starve if I didn't ask for the suggested 20 or so bottles on the list, and my little end up not liking either of the 3pk brands I did choose.  \nOn the flipside, I did get a little annoyed with a few people who went to town with what they thought I would need. (I got 3 diaper genies and I didn't even want one, all I could think was poop sausages, no thanks.) My aunt went so far as to say if I had just put it on the registry there wouldn't have been duplicates, then cried on a visit when she found out I returned them all into gift cards, then used the gift cards to get the things we really ended up needing as we came upon it. \nReally, half the items you don't use long, or is just too much to ask someone to buy for you.

I always add gift receipts to items and what the person does with it when they receive it is up to them, but I've never had someone scold me for getting the wrong free gift. If someone scolded me for buying the wrong gift I would simply ask for said gift back since they are ungrateful and don't want it, so I can get my money back or donate it to someone who would be happy to use the item. \n\nI received plenty of stuff over the years that I already had or I don't really need, but never in a millions years would I ever tell the person I didn't like it and they should have bought me something else. Why make someone feel like shit when they put thought, effort, and money into the gift for me? I say thank you and I appreciate the gift. They didn't have to get me anything and could have used that money on themselves, but they choose to spend it on a gift for someone else which is worth more than anything no matter what the item is. OP's sister is TA for being ungrateful about the gift OP gave. The sister could have just as easily said thank you and left it as that.", "Why? It's not a catalog, but a list of \"gimme, please.\"\n\nThere's nothing wrong with gifts from the heart.", "People who have a changing pad", "Yeah which is why you get a multi pack and not a couple monogrammed ones that the baby will quickly grow out of.\n\nAlso not everyone wants a changing pad to lug around and its possible they already have one. Hence the registry with what they wanted/needed.", "They are not only an American thing. E.g. wedding registries are very common in most Western countries. It's considerate for both the recipient and the giver: helps the newly-weds / new parents get essential, useful items; and makes gift decisions easier for the gifter.", "In the case of a baby registry, I completely understand it\u2026the mom-to-be is about to have a major life change, and babies need a ton of stuff. The registry the mom\u2019s way of letting you know what she and the baby need and what would be most helpful.", "Gift lifts in general are a whole other thing but for weddings and especially baby showers they DO serve a very specific purpose. For American weddings, gifts  are meant to be something to help the new couple start their home together. The registry was so the couple could not only communicate what items they still need for their home, but guests don\u2019t have to guess what color and pattern towels the couple would like. This has somewhat changed now that the average couple is getting married a little older, often has lived outside their parents home already, and often have already been living with their new spouse so they have silverware and towels and a toaster.  Now, often registries are more home items that are either nicer versions of what the couple already has (for example a matching set of nice drinking glasses instead of miscellaneous old cups they have had since college). Or are things like nice serverware, which is hard to justify buying for yourself, but very nice to have especially if you are having people over for dinner.\n\nNow for baby showers specifically, it\u2019s still more of my first example of items NEEDED, and the gifts are a bigger deal. Generally baby showers are for a woman\u2019s first baby, and while it is general celebration of her pregnancy, the point is to \u201cshower\u201d them with what they\u2019ll need as a new mom. As opposed to a wedding where the point is to witness and celebrate a new marriage and gifts are generally expected but not the actual point of the gathering.\n\nOften by the time of the baby shower, the pregnant woman will have purchased some items already,  will have gotten some gifted or loaned from family and friends, etc.  So the registry helps to direct people and say, \u201cI already have a stroller but a diaper pail is still needed!\u201d.   Everybody wants to buy cute baby clothes, but babies grow out of them in an instant. I have a friend who had a large baby shower and they had to buy a bigger dresser to hold the dozens of teeny outfits people brought. Which, whatever, they were gifts, but in that case were often given in addition to an item from the registry.\n\nSo while OP was well meaning, the fact that she chose to spend her very limited gift funds on a custom outfit instead of diapers or something the sister actually needs and asked for is frustrating.  I wouldn\u2019t go as far to say she\u2019s an asshole, I think she\u2019s just naiive.  The sister being frustrated is understandable but she handled it in a rude and unnecessary way.  The gift was given, it doesn\u2019t hurt anybody it\u2019s just not particularly helpful, what\u2019s done is done, you can privately roll your eyes and then be polite and thank OP for the gift and move on.", "Because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll get stupid problems like unwrapping 9 different toaster ovens.", "Different registries serve different purposes.  Baby registries have become very popular for practical reasons. \n1. It cuts down on everyone asking the parents what they need. I come from a large family and by the time my youngest sister came around there wasn't really anything baby related she did not have but there would still be people trying to gift her items she had no use for. No one needs 5 diaper bags.\n2. Depending on the registry there are some that allow a group to pool money online for a big purchase. I've done with with coworkers for things like strollers and baby monitors. Things that are practical but not necessarily that it is nice to help out on.", "Because there so many different options on baby items. Parents have preferences and it allows people to buy stuff the parents would actually use.", "This American (me) has always believed that registries were like wish lists, not obligatory purchase lists. OP got a sweet and thoughtful gift. Too bad her sister doesn't find the meaning in her gift.", "I was bullied into having one for my wedding. People wanted to give us stuff, and wanted it to be things we actually wanted/needed.", "I'm in Canada and we have this, too. From my understanding, they're usually wish lists\n\nThe best baby shower I ever went to, the couple only asked everyone for diapers lol", "Is the same with people expecting money as wedding gifts, for me that's pretty much as selling the entry ticket for your party. Too vulgar", "Depends on the parent.  I was inundated with offers of bags of clothing because so many people got 0-3 that their kids didn't even get a chance to wear.", "We wasted so much money on clothes. My Daughter is now 11 months and is just now getting through some of her bigger ones. We aren't far off Winter here so it's just more clothes we will have to buy soon. You can definitely have too many.", "Exactly!  A new parent can never have too many onesies.", "What exactly is the point of giving a gift that the recipient neither wants nor needs, but YOU wanted to give them? What's the end-game? To make YOURSELF feel fuzzy inside? Cause that's not really the point of everyone coming together to support a new parent.", "You should, however, be purchasing a gift the giftee will like. Not something you like or think is cute. It\u2019s a perennial problem. I always appreciate gifts. I would never yell at someone for not giving me a registry gift, but I might be frustrated if it were something I wouldn\u2019t wear on the baby, wasn\u2019t practical, if I didn\u2019t want to advertise their name on their body (dangerous, to some degree). Gifts aren\u2019t for the person who buys the gift. Gift buying and giving doesn\u2019t exist to strike your ego.  It\u2019s an expression of friendship or joy and should be uniquely focused on the gift receiver. If you\u2019re great at choosing gifts that the receive loves, then choose them. If you\u2019re not, registries and wish lists make sense. There is no point in making a gift recipient feel guilty that you spent money (or time) on a gift that they will never use. \n\nAs for OP, I think it was rude of your sis to call you out. I can\u2019t decide on a judgment, because I actually do like registries and wish lists. It means I can buy people things they really want and will be useful. Now, if there was nothing on the list that was in your budget, I think the better option is to ask for more budget-conscious items to be added to the registry.", "The sister was not gracious and that is unacceptable. Although, as such a close relative, it would have been great if OP could have chosen a gift that would have been better received, even if it wasn't on the registry. What concerns me more is that OP's sister seems to need things so badly that she's already in a sour mood about it. Having the baby is just the tip of the iceberg. If you can't comfortably provide for the child from the get-go, what will happen as time goes on? Kids only get more expensive as they grow.", "NTA - agree totally. A registry is meant to be a helpful guide for gift givers, not a command station. Sheesh.", "I highly doubt if she can return PERSONALIZED onesies. That's actually part of the point of a registry: you can return gifts you've registered for to the store if you get too many or you decide that you don't need something after all. Off-registry gifts, especially things like personalized ANYTHING, are often not returnable even if they're the wrong size or not needed. Which is one of the many, many reasons why you should always buy off someone's registry: because it makes life easier for the recipient, who is supposed to be the person you're thinking of and celebrating.", "And OP should know that about her sister and shopped accordingly.", "THIS. When I got married we had a registry. The few people who went off registry got us things that were spot on 'us' and we were delighted.\n\n A gift is a gift, and your sister will find that yours were both thoughtful and needed. NTA.", "No way. They're a suggestion only and a guide as to things they are looking for. Nobody is obligated to buy off it.\n\nMy favourite gifts ended up being custom/hand made items as well as things we hadn't realized we wanted. Experienced moms gave us the most useful things they had and they were *lifesavers*.", "What a terrible analogy!", "Why? If sister can't get her own baby stuff for her own baby, she shouldn't be having a baby.", "Not even the same damn thing.", "Onesies aren\u2019t useful?!", "Right, like, I assume onesies are on the registry because that's what newborns wear. But OP got custom onesies that weren't on the registry, but better. Or OP's sister is clueless and doesn't realize the power of onesies. NtA", "The lack of graciousness for people who give ANY gift is appalling and gross. Registries are not a required guideline someone MUST follow. When someone gives you a gift, you say thank you and appreciate their gesture.", "How about being grateful for anything at all??", "And yet they could afford a custom made onesie, which the mother to be could not return if she didn't like it.", "The sister should have kept her mouth shut and be grateful. Is incredible how entitled are some people", "What? When you receive a gift, you smile, say that you love it and thank the gift giver. No matter what, no excuses, no other course of action.  Only exception is if the gift is something offensive or illegal. Same when someone cooks for you. \n\nNTA. Take the stuff back and get a refund. Don't ever waste any money in gifts for someone that don't appreciate it.", "Wrong. Registries are suggestions.", "You forgot the S/", "I'm with you here because I just helped with my BFF'S baby shower. Frankly, baby gifts are a whole different ballpark. She's not \"ungrateful\" over a birthday gift or wedding - each item on a registry serves a specific purpose to streamline tasks or take something off the parent's mental load.\n\nThe whole goal of a baby shower is to empower that new parent and help provide the **tools** they need for a baby. I think it's kinda a dick move to decide that you know they need better than they do.\n\nYTA", "But YTA? Really? Surely at worst this would be an NAH or an ESH at worst. I mean, she still bought a gift that was thoughtful and minorly useful? And surely if you receive a gift, even if it's not what you want most of all, you should be thankful (instead of going off at the gift giver)?", "Hhahahaha your level of entitlement is astonishing.", "What's more considerate than a gift from the heart?", ">the registry is likely to contain things they absolutely need and perhaps can't afford to buy.\n\nThen they shouldn't be having a baby.", "Registries aren\u2019t tacky at all. They are incredibly practical. \n\nIt avoids a variety of realistic problems like five different people showing up and giving you five different toaster ovens. It also takes the guesswork out of things by people telling their guests what would be useful or helpful to them.\n\nFinally, it avoids another problem. Which is that gift giving is actually kind of difficult to do right. Particularly in terms of matters where personal taste or preferences are involved. Unless you really, really know someone preferences\u2014which is something people tend to *wildly* overestimate their ability at\u2014you\u2019re probably going to get them something they just flatly don\u2019t want and they get absolutely nothing out of. All the while, you could have just very simply picked something off the registry. \n\nSo in short registries exist because if you don\u2019t have one, you\u2019re likely going to get a ton of duplicate gifts, not get a lot of the things you actually needed/wanted, and get a lot of just junk that you\u2019re going to end up storing somewhere until it\u2019s socially acceptable to either donate it or throw it in the trash.", "To add on to Queso\u2019s great points, showers aren\u2019t supposed to be about expectations of other people providing for your new child. They\u2019re your friends and family caring about you and wanting to celebrate the massive life change, often wanting to *shower* you with gifts (sometimes annoyingly so at least in my experience). If someone\u2019s unwilling or unable to join in the gift giving, that\u2019s perfectly fine too. \n\nOP is NTA though.", "Yes, take back the *incredibly useful* personalized onsies, and do what with them?", "Found the sister.", "They may have been re gifts then?

I got my very close friend a subscription for 3 months of the brand she had listed on the registry. That was obviously not a cheaper end gift, but my friend said it was more helpful than she realized it would be because the diapers were just delivered to their house on time and they never worried about running out for some while they were exhausted. I also helped her set up her own account after my subscription ended.\n\nEdit: typo", "I was.  It was an unnecessary hassle.  I was also polite and thankful to the people who gave them.", "I\u2019ve never seen a registry that didn\u2019t have some diapers!", "It really depends what's on the registry. They might not have had changing mats and onesies on it because they already had those things.

It's difficult to judge this one without knowing what the registry looks like.", "Tbh if they got a vacuum cleaner surely they could\u2019ve afforded something on the registry. In general, it\u2019s a good idea for people to have a range of prices, & usually there\u2019s a gift card option as well.

I can\u2019t imagine the average mother getting annoyed at any gifts here.", "Exactly! This is spot on. Someone could have regifted something or got a deal on something. Not only are people losing compassion they are losing gratefulness.", "Hmm most people would have things on it that are pretty affordable.

That is rudeness and entitlement on a level that rises to insanity.\n\n And if you have so much stuff from a first shower, skip the second shower.

If you can\u2019t afford anything on the registry then obviously you shouldn\u2019t overextend yourself to adhere to it.

It is to give someone something they are going to like/want/enjoy. \n\nLet\u2019s think about the stereotypical bad gift giver. A golf-mad husband married to a wife who is a bookworm who isn\u2019t into golf or sports. Instead of getting her books, he gets her golf clubs for her birthday. I think we can agree that the husband did a shabby job there because he bought for his preferences and not his wife\u2019s. \n\nNow, not everyone is going to necessarily be able to know exactly what the recipient wants or needs since it\u2019s a pretty personal thing and as mentioned, you don\u2019t want them to get nine different toaster ovens and three vacuums. So, it makes a hell of a lot of sense for them to post a list of what is actually helpful. \n\nAgain, I can see the point of someone saying \u201cwhy am I automatically expected to get someone a gift because they done got knocked up?\u201d There may be a real discussion there. \n\nHowever if you are going to get someone a gift, you should get them something that\u2019s wanted and useful, and the registry is a really, really practical tool in that regard.", "It\u2019s not thoughtful though.

I always give 3-6mo or even 6-9mo sizes as shower gifts now.  They might not fit a newborn, but babies grow so quickly that they'll be needed pretty soon.

If someone is having a child, they should hopefully be able to get most of the things they'll need anyway, a registry is just to help them out if possible.\n\nAnd I have seen plenty of people put expensive things on a registry, that the average person can't afford. So we really don't know if there was anything OP could afford on there. And even with her financial issues she still tried to get her something useful. And what baby doesn't need clothes?\n\nAnd the analogy with the dog doesn't work. If my dog needed medicine, it'd still be my responsibility to pay for it.

Being *hostile* to someone giving you a gift seems to me like the height of self-entitlement - OP, I would be not giving your sister any more gifts, full stop, on any occasion, as it's clear all she really wants is cash in acceptable denominations, and I'd wager my own money someone who responds this way to *any* gift doesn't actually appreciate even those.", "If a husband gives a housewife a new vacuum for her birthday, do you think she owes him gratitude and thanks for that too?

If that\u2019s the case I can see the sister being hurt, even though that\u2019s never an excuse for the sister to be rude. \n\nAt the most recent shower I went to I gifted postpartum care items from the registry like witch hazel pads. Really not fun or cute\u2026but I know how much I needed those things and I really want her to have the same comforts I did. If nobody buys those things off the registry she might just go without.

It is intended to help them along their way of parenthood and a celebration. \n\nPart of the custom is baby related gifts. So remember the little lesson on gift giving\u2014you get people things based on *their* wants and preference and not yours?  Still applies!!  \n\nSo here, OP was to get a gift. Her sister posted a goddamn list of things that would be helpful. But instead of saying \u201chey this stuff would help her out.\u201d She says \u201caha!

They cost $5-20.", "You know what?  Yes. \n\nBecause most of the time, when someone goes off registry and gets something they think is some \u201cunique\u201d gift that is off registry, it usually ends up being some white elephant to the recipient. They don\u2019t want it, but due to social pressure they have to thank them for it, pretend to like it, and then keep it for some appreciable length of time as just clutter somewhere in a garage, attic or closet. It does them no favors and usually just ends up being an imposition. \n\nMeanwhile they could have actually gotten something helpful.  Just get something off the goddamn registry?\n\nCan we talk about that?  Absent things being unavailable or out of someone\u2019s price range\u2014*why not just buy off the goddamn registry*?

I had registries at like 4 different places so I could get the freebies and discounts on the things I needed. When my baby shower was planned (which, usually not planned by the parents to be) the host asked for my registry so she could include it in the invitations. Before the baby shower was planned most of my family asked for my registry to know what to get.

Something I learned the hard way is that you\u2019ve got to put yourself aside and really listen to what they like and in a lot of cases people will actually tell you exactly what that is. If you just bulldoze over that, you just end up with a very wasteful situation where you\u2019re giving or receiving a lot of white elephants.

It definitely sounds like your sister was pretty out of line. \n\nBut here\u2019s a few wise words for your next baby shower (and god help you, I hope it\u2019s many many years from now because they\u2019re generally the worst):\n\nBaby shower is a mixed bag. Generally, you get a bunch of useless stuff and very few items you actually need\u2026because the things you *need* are usually higher ticket items. Baby clothes on the other hand, can typically be sourced very easily. Hell, you can get a big ass trash bag full \u2018em for for free! Ask any parent of a toddler, lol.\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna give clothes at a baby shower, don\u2019t give onesies. Size wayyy up, and buy something more substantial. Someone gave me a T3 double lined Columbia rain jacket at my baby shower and it was genius. That thing got some REAL milage before it was retired, because you can always wear a jacket that\u2019s slightly too big, and it\u2019s something they actually NEED. \n\nGenerally, you wanna stick to the registry. Most people include a range pricing, because it\u2019s understood that many people can\u2019t afford the an expensive crib or stroller. \n\nOr better still, team up with some of the other attendees and pool your money to get a big purchase- I would have preferred getting way LESS stuff generally (that said, I graciously accepted all gifts and was appreciative of everything and everyone and sent thank you cards - your sister is def the AH here).\n\nIf you can\u2019t do ANY of that, get mom a lil gift of a postpartum care package (there are great ideas online). \n\nOr just give them MONEY. \n\nEnd of baby shower rant, thank you for your time lol", "ESH\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t call you out, but babies don\u2019t need embroidered onesies that get poop and spit up stains and grown out of real fast, it\u2019s more practical to buy what they need and will use.", "ESH- she could have handled it better, but the point of a registry is so that the items gifted are needed/wanted.\n\nPersonally, I hate clothing with kids names on them and would have been super irritated too to get that. I was irritated after our baby shower and we got tons of clothes, when we already had a bunch, but the only one who knew I was irked was my husband.", "NTA, and for every gift-giving event from now until eternity, buy her a $5 Subway card.

I think your gift was heartfelt and special.", "YTA. I\u2019m assuming everyone saying NTA has never been to an actual baby shower or has no kids.

Then the mom gets less practical things but has a ton of clothes the baby will wear 1-2 times", "Often they don't even fit at all  so never get worn and can't even be passed on to others in need because they have a name stuck on them. Basically, getting names put on clothes often ensures they wind up unused in the trash unfortunately. ALL of this could have been prevented by just speaking with their sister and asking what she needed most before doing anything.", "Yeah I have no idea why so many special baby clothes are hand wash only or have special cleaning instructions or are even dry clean only but it's a massive pain in the ass for parents", ">ghastly bullshit\n\nI love this, lol.", "I am so sad I did not discover kimono onesies earlier than I did.. and it was because of an older ukranian co worker who bought them off registry!", "A changing mat is something she will never use? Get real.", "Yes! I get it - you don't HAVE to give anything. But if someone has gone through the effort to say what they need - they stick to that or buy them nothing if you have that much of a stick up your ass about it!!\n\nI hate waste. I hate having to deal with things cluttering my home I didn't ask for, want, or need. Years of receiving trash gifts from people who continue to ask me what I want then just completely ignore it after I go through the effort of making lists (keeping their budget in mind!) have probably made me sensitive to this, but frig - if you want to gift something, gift something useful. Not for your own selfish desire to know what someone needs more than they do!\n\n(For the record, I would never say anything but thank you to someone's face for a gift. But I will fume inside at having gone through the effort to make a list and have it be ignored. And be pissed as hell when I have to try and donate it - driving an hour to do so - or try qnd give it away - also having to drive to meet someone to give it away. So I end up chucking brand new items in the trash and feeling like shit for doing so)", "It sounds more like it was a gift she would have enjoyed if she were having a baby. I would have hated receiving personalized onesies for my kids (because I don\u2019t like onesies and my kids didn\u2019t wear them) and feeling like I had to wear them on the kids at least once. I also would have felt really bad that someone spent money, time, and energy on a gift that I couldn\u2019t use or enjoy. \n\nReceiving  gifts you don\u2019t want and don\u2019t like turns a gift from something joyful into something more like a guilt trip. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m an advocate for wish lists and registries (within reason; there should always be affordable items on it or a note for, like, dollar store items that can be purchased for those who can\u2019t buy more expensive items). They allow gift givers to give the perfect gift and gift recipients to know how much they are cared for. \n\nNow, it\u2019s possible the sister was just being greedy and wanted expensive items. Or it\u2019s possible that\u2019s she\u2019s received 20+ years of gifts she didn\u2019t want and didn\u2019t like from her sister already; and it was just the last straw. Or maybe she doesn\u2019t like surprises. Not everyone does. Not everyone is into unique and handmade. Getting gifts for other people can actually be really fraught because there is so much emotion tangled up in it. The gift giver put thought into the gift. The gift recipient feels like they didn\u2019t because otherwise, how could they possibly have chosen this?", "What a terrible position the kind gift-givers put you in.", "As another commenter said, the only acceptable response to a gift is \u201cthank you.\u201d Do you really spend time trying to figure out the motive of someone giving you a gift?", ">You had better be going in with the 'needs' already as sorted \n\nExactly! I have 4 kids. (Never had a baby shower) and we had just about everything we needed for each of them. Of course family and friends gave us small gifts like bedding, nappies, bath stuff and cute towels. \n\nI've seen on some mum groups people putting the car seats, travel systems, cribs etc - some really bloody expensive things on their registries and I'm blown away! Some women have even said that they don't allow people to eat at their baby shower if they didn't bring a gift over a certain value. Like ffs, spend the money on the stuff your kids need, not a damn party!", "As someone who just had a baby shower - the people who bought off registry all seemed to get us clothes in the newborn size (which in case you're not familiar, is the smallest non-preemie size and tends to fit most babies for a few *weeks* before the babies grow into the next size). So I've got mountains of tiny clothes that my baby will honestly likely never wear, and I can't return because I don't know where a lot of these clothes came from! Meanwhile, no one bought diapers or baby bottles which the baby will use every day. \n\nNow of course I said \"thank you\" and \"how adorable\" and \"he'll look so cute in this.\" But I understand the frustration. People think they're being more thoughtful and special by going off-registry, but the lack of coordination and reluctance to buy things that aren't as \"fun,\" but much more necessary, makes it a pain. I'll regift the clothes we don't use or try to sell them on Facebook, but it's a waste of money for all of the gifters who spent $40 on a cute name brand onesie that will either get worn 1-2 times and donated, or sold for $5.", "At the end of the day, that's the whole point here. Yes, registries exist for a reason - and sometimes a registry is more than a person can spend, even if those creating the registry try hard to add a broad number of things to it.   \n\n\nAs long as a gift isn't just outright insulting, even if it's something you don't need or weren't super enthusiastic about receiving the polite thing to do is thank someone graciously and then decide later what you'll do with a gift that isn't your style/what you want. Decent etiquette = not being an asshole.  \n\n\nNTA.", "Absolutely. We received things for our wedding not on our registry, we thanked them, sent a nice thank you card, then figured out how to exchange it.

NO ONE IS ENTITLED TO GIFTS.\nSay it louder for the people in the back. \n\nIt used to be considered incredibly rude to throw a shower for one's self (it still is in my circles).

Be gracious and appreciative that they thought about you at all.", "Correct, like I said unless a gift is totally inappropriate you should always act grateful, but just because someone spent time and consideration on a gift doesn't mean that the recipient is going to like it or even give a fuck about it.\n\nI always either buy something specifically asked for or give cash.", "Or, you know, go off the damn registry.", "Lol. You have clearly never tried to carry 2 vacuum cleaner boxes, plus a bunch of other things you don't need, into a store at one time.  It is possible to be grateful for gifts and annoyed at the process at the same time.  People can multitask.  I loved the cash gifts.", "Lol it\u2019s a huge pain to try and return gifts that people don\u2019t buy off registry. You don\u2019t usually have the receipt. Often you don\u2019t even know where they bought it. If I got a vacuum cleaner there are literally 10 stores off the top of head in my town alone that sell vacuums. 7+ month pregnant mom is supposed to just go all around town asking stores if they\u2019ll take the item? I got a dish set for my wedding shower (we already got 2 entire sets FROM our registry) and I eventually just had to donate them because I went to 6 different stores trying to return and never figured out where they came from. \n\nOne of the best things about people buying off registry is 1. You know they want/need it and 2.

We won\u2019t use these (well, we\u2019ll put him in them for when these people come over, or for a picture to send them, but that\u2019s it.\n\nObviously we said thank you and were polite.

I also picked out a carseat with the highest safety ratings.  I don't think it makes someone self-absorbed to spend time and thought trying to find the items that will best work for them.

I was so against it my husband did most of the registry because he knew what our chosen color/theme was. I added maybe a couple of things but that was contribution.

However I appreciate every person who came to my shower (on a very cold and snowy day) because they were there because they loved me and my husband and were excited to celebrate our little baby boy. I never expect anything for anyone, but I appreciate that these people wanted to help in whatever way they could and honestly now couldn't tell you what was on my registry that I didn't receive but I do remember who was there to celebrate. I hate that there is so much focus put on registries and what people think they \"deserve\" and than get angry because they feel they somehow got cheated because they didn't receive exactly what they wanted, they forget what a shower truly is a day celebrating people that love you come together for no other reason but they love you and want to celebrate a huge milestone in your life.
