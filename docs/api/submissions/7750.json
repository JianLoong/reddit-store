{"id": 7750, "submission_id": "10g4dbn", "title": "AITA for not paying attention to my (24m) GF (23f) when I am WFH", "selftext": "I'm a software engineer, I work from home 5 days a week, 8 hours a day and work to some pretty strict deadlines. My company overwork me and they do it because they know I like being busy, but it often means I'm working on 3/4 projects at a time and barely have a moment to step up from my desk while I work.\n\nMy partner had a week off this week and we got into an argument today. All week she has been asking me to do stuff while I'm working, like go to the shops with her or go on a long walk or even dropping her sister in another city (a 90 minute round trip!). She also keeps coming into my home office and starting long conversations which take 20-25 minutes to talk through.\n\nSo she came in to speak to me and started having a rant about her family. After about 5 minutes, I hadn't responded and she asked why I was ignoring her. I said \"I'm really sorry but I've got a deadline today and I need to work towards it, can you talk to me after work?\". She said \"surely you can stop for a minute to talk\" and I said \"it's not a minute though is it? You've already been talking for about 5 minutes\". She said that I prioritise work over her and I've made no effort to do anything with her this week. I said that it's her week off not mine and I have deadlines to reach to and she shouldn't be so selfish and she should leave me alone until I've finished work. She called me an asshole and stormed out.\n\nI don't physically understand what I did wrong. I just want to focus on my work. When work is over then she can have my time. In my view, she should act like I'm in the office even though I'm WFH and not disturb me unless it's important.\n\nBut all day she's been giving me the silent treatment and I can't help but doubt myself that maybe I was an asshole. Maybe I should have used my lunch break to go on a walk with her and talk about what she wanted to talk about, but in a selfish way, I like to just chill and eat food on my own on my lunch break because my job is mentally taxing and I need a 30 minute period of nothing to recover...\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1674141753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g4dbn/aita_for_not_paying_attention_to_my_24m_gf_23f/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everything you said to her was a correct! She needs to go vent to some friends, or find a hobby to do etc. she is being selfish and disrespectful.

It's not social time. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA - your GF doesn't seem to be able to get a grip on the fact that while she is on vacation, you are not and WFH does not mean \"only when my GF isn't demanding my attention\".  I WFH and my husband will stick his head into my work area occasionally to tell me something funny he read or some such, but never when he can tell I'm in a meeting and he always stays out of camera range just in case I'm on a meeting, but just not talking.

A few minutes of conversations are ok, lunch breaks are good to spend time with family (or gf here). But, your work boundary should be respected on the same.\nHaving said that, you could have clarified this/talked to her gently the first/second time it happened so she knew what to expect.

This isn't a vacation or time off. She'd be pissed if you came into her work place and kept bugging her all day. You'll get in trouble if you can't focus and complete your work.

If you were in the office she wouldn\u2019t expect you to talk to her? I think she probably had an expectation that you would slow things down to hang with her, but she shouldn\u2019t have just expected it without telling you.", "NTA - you work from home, which means you should be working. I can understand why she was shocked today though. IMO you should have nipped it in the bud on Monday. When you noticed she assumed you would have time for her during the work day then you should have had an honest conversation with her about your work, the deadlines you are on and that you would not be available to her. The fact that you let her continue to chat with you throughout the week without being honest about your workload and then lost your sh*t on her, I would be upset if I were her too. If you never told her until today, then she had no idea. Communication would have avoided the fight.", "NTA.

If I want to go to lunch together, that has to be negotiated.\n\nDid she want you to also take this week off? If so, she needs to communicate that ahead of time so you can book PTO. Is work bleeding over for you? Do you spend enough time together outside work hours to meet her needs?", "NTA\nOf course not.

Too many people, friends, family and partners, think physically at home means physically and mentally available.

When my BF has his 9/80 Friday off, I often have to remind him that I\u2019m working.", "NTA.  Work from home is still WORK, and you have deadlines to meet.  You can't drop everything for her.  She should learn to treat your WFH situation as if you are at the office.  Point out to her that you wouldn't expect her to leave her job for 90 minutes to drive her sister somewhere (presumably), you can't just get up and leave your job to run long errands just because you are WFH.", "NTA you have completely failed to establish any boundaries with your gf. My husband works from home since 2020. I dont go in his office at all, if I want to speak to him then I will wait until he comes out to go to the loo, or get food or a drink from the kitchen. She needs to understand that you are at work. You need to be firm on your set of rules.", "NTA. Would she drop in at your office to talk to you or rant? She should treat your home office like what it is: your office. She should respect it accordingly.", "NTA. Maybe phrase it like this:  \"If I were at the office right now, what would YOU be doing?\"  When she answers you, say \"then do that, because I AM AT THE OFFICE.  The Office just happens to be HERE right now.\"", "Nta, it's already super annoying when someone tries to talk to you while you work, can't properly concentrate on neither. Why some people treat home offices like a vacation, it actually doesn't matter where the office is, work needs to be done either way. She's acting childish about it, better have a serious talk with her about not disturbing your work time.", "NTA - A lot of people who don't work from home don't quite understand what it entails. I think some have this romantic notion that you can take a break whenever you want. \n\nAlso, some people work in fields that don't have a huge cognitive load, so when you finish one task, you can easily move on to the next. Coding is not like this. The amount of things you need to keep in your head is quite large, and is usually as stable as a house of cards. When you get interrupted unexpectedly, it's not like you can just go back to work. You typically need to rework the whole workflow, re-read elements of the code base etc.  So a 5 minute interruption is actually costing something like 30 minutes of re-boot time.\n\nAs you said, you're basically in the office.  I would offer a compromise and say \"*tell you what, whenever I finish a task, I'll get out of the office and we can chat while I have a coffee, but when I'm in there, please respect my work\"*\n\nHowever, someone saying that you are prioritizing earning a living which allows you to put food on the table and a roof over your head is probably not going to have the proper maturity to understand any of this.", "NTA\n\nYour gf is really immature. Impacting your work, trying to make you feel bad for needing to work your shift, and then the silent treatment?\n\nThis is not an adult that is ready for a healthy relationship. l\n\nYou're gonna have to set a boundary, which means advising her of the consequences and enforcing the consequences.\n\n\"If you can't leave me to my work, I'll be locking the door.\"\n\n\"If you can't leave me to my work, and don't apologize for how you've treated me, then we will need to live separately or break up.\"", "Have you talked to her and set some boundaries regarding your work hours before? Many people WFH and are available to do other things, it\u2019s not always assumed that you\u2019re busy the entire time. I can talk my fianc\u00e9s ear off for an hour while he\u2019s working and it doesn\u2019t matter lol. \n\nIf not, then YTA. Just tell her that you\u2019re busy during work hours.

We usually align our coffee breaks when we both work from home, and have dinner together. \n\nYour GF may not know how much you need to focus on your work. Many people don\u2018t get what developing software actually means. What they see is usually a quiet person typing away all day not realising how much brain power goes into this. \nAnd how even a small disturbance can ruin hours of work done previously.

Here are some things that might help. Get a cute sign that says something like killin it in the office/slammed harder than shot glasses at happy hour, please text me and I\u2019ll get back to you asap and post it on the door. Get a lock and lock your office, if you don\u2019t have them get some great noise cancelling headphones(my partner loves his Bose ote ones as the noise cancelling is kick ass) grab some dev music(Spotify web developers delight is pretty great) and make your office space work for you. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re coming to the realization your partner doesn\u2019t understand the wfh requirements for your job. What does your wife do for a living? If she works in an office how intensive is her job? Does she work in marketing and sales and spend a lot of her time on the phone speaking with coworkers, clients, walking around an office, or is she glued to a desk crunching numbers or writing reports or filing legal briefs? \n\nDepending on how her job goes she may have the ability of it being a more social job and being able to take 5 mins to vent about something frustrating you while waiting for a new pot of coffee or on a 10. She may literally just not ever worked a job that had her on a pounding schedule and also she might not even understand how teams works and how your work is done or assigned. \n\nYou also might want to sit down with your partner and explain how your job actually works and show her some coding. Let her see how mentally taxing and how much focus it takes to do something simple like \u201chello world\u201d. Udemy has some great free coding classes also so she could try to learn for herself what it\u2019s like. \n\nI would be sensitive in how you do the talking part as I don\u2019t think she intentionally is trying to disrespect you but just isn\u2019t aware of how your job works and she was already feeling upset and wanted to talk to you about that. Unfortunately, sometimes we can\u2019t always get exactly what we want when we want it and have to wait. You aren\u2019t unreasonable and I hope that she accepts this as a learning point for her and there aren\u2019t any more problems. If she gives you a hard time then it might be time to look at if this is a pattern of behavior she normally follows. \n\nPartners are supposed to be two people working together to help create one whole family", "NTA.\n\nWould she randomly drop by an on-site office and expect you to go for a walk/taxi her sibling to another city/have a long chat in the middle of the workday?

When you work from home, that separation of work/life is difficult to maintain, and those that haven't ever done it or ever want to do it have a really hard time understanding what it's like.   \n\n\nI've worked from home for something like 11 years at this point. I have only ever once dated someone who actually got it. The rest definitely got a bit salty.
