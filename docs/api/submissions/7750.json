{"id": 7750, "submission_id": "10g4dbn", "title": "AITA for not paying attention to my (24m) GF (23f) when I am WFH", "selftext": "I'm a software engineer, I work from home 5 days a week, 8 hours a day and work to some pretty strict deadlines. My company overwork me and they do it because they know I like being busy, but it often means I'm working on 3/4 projects at a time and barely have a moment to step up from my desk while I work.\n\nMy partner had a week off this week and we got into an argument today. All week she has been asking me to do stuff while I'm working, like go to the shops with her or go on a long walk or even dropping her sister in another city (a 90 minute round trip!). She also keeps coming into my home office and starting long conversations which take 20-25 minutes to talk through.\n\nSo she came in to speak to me and started having a rant about her family. After about 5 minutes, I hadn't responded and she asked why I was ignoring her. I said \"I'm really sorry but I've got a deadline today and I need to work towards it, can you talk to me after work?\". She said \"surely you can stop for a minute to talk\" and I said \"it's not a minute though is it? You've already been talking for about 5 minutes\". She said that I prioritise work over her and I've made no effort to do anything with her this week. I said that it's her week off not mine and I have deadlines to reach to and she shouldn't be so selfish and she should leave me alone until I've finished work. She called me an asshole and stormed out.\n\nI don't physically understand what I did wrong. I just want to focus on my work. When work is over then she can have my time. In my view, she should act like I'm in the office even though I'm WFH and not disturb me unless it's important.\n\nBut all day she's been giving me the silent treatment and I can't help but doubt myself that maybe I was an asshole. Maybe I should have used my lunch break to go on a walk with her and talk about what she wanted to talk about, but in a selfish way, I like to just chill and eat food on my own on my lunch break because my job is mentally taxing and I need a 30 minute period of nothing to recover...\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1674141753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g4dbn/aita_for_not_paying_attention_to_my_24m_gf_23f/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

WFH isn't a staycation.", "NTA, if she\u2019s never wfh before she probably is assuming there\u2019s a lot more freedom than there is, especially in swe. Just let her know, work is work even if you\u2019re at home and deadlines don\u2019t get less serious just because you aren\u2019t in office.", "NTA. You are working. She needs to find a way to entertain herself.", "NTA! I completely agree with you: it's her week off, not yours. Could you have worded better? Maybe.", "You need to sit down and tell her that although you are at home, you are still working.  She wouldn't expect you to be able to listen to her or go on trips if you were working on site.\n\nWork hours are work hours.\n\nNTA", "NTA but your gf is an idiot.", "NTA.  I can't believe how many posts I see where someone is WFH, and their partner doesn't understand that work is still work.", "NTA. You are working. From 8am to 5pm you are in work mode. That doesn\u2019t mean you can go shopping, or go for long walks etc it means you sit at your desk (with breaks for lunch etc) and work. Girlfriend clearly has too much time on her hands and an immaturity issue if she doesn\u2019t get that. She should have planned her leave better to time it with yours. \n\nYou would only suck if you still did this after hours.", "NTA. You have to set boundaries for your work day as if you were working from an office you commute to. She isn't understanding nor does she respect your boundaries.", "NTA, WFH doesnt mean vacation.\n\nYou're still at work, only from home.\n\nYou better explain this clearly to your g/f because she clearly sounds very unreasonable.", ">In my view, she should act like I'm in the office even though I'm WFH and not disturb me unless it's important.\n\nThis is absolutely correct. NTA.", "NTA. Work time is for work. No different to if you were in the office.", "NTA - She needs to respect your boundaries and understand that you're working and don't have the time. She also perhaps needs to grow up a little as well, given her reaction.", "NTA\n\nYour not on vacation, your working.  You don't get to take breaks and do stuff with her simply because she is on vacation.  she absolutely should act like you are in the office when you are WAH.\n\nHow is this even a question?  Your girlfriend needs to grow up", "NTA - youre working. Youre busy. This isnt a hard concept.", "NTA. What is it about people not understanding that you\u2019re working from home and it\u2019s not just an excuse to slack off and disappear for long periods of time, if you were in the office she wouldn\u2019t keep phoning you for a chat. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong this is her problem.", "NTA\nBut it probs wouldve been a good idea to communicate better", "I really can\u2019t comprehend any many people don\u2019t understand that WFH means work. Would your GF barge in your office building and do the shit she did this morning? Probably not. It\u2019s really NOT hard to understand that work means work, wherever you may be doing it at. Everything you said to her was a correct! She needs to go vent to some friends, or find a hobby to do etc. she is being selfish and disrespectful. And than childish by playing the silent treatment game because she didn\u2019t get her way. She needs to grow up!", "NTA. She obviously knows you're working and it's common sense to not continuously interrupt someone who is working. Of course you're not prioritizing her while you're working - work is the priority at that time. It's not social time. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA - your GF doesn't seem to be able to get a grip on the fact that while she is on vacation, you are not and WFH does not mean \"only when my GF isn't demanding my attention\".  I WFH and my husband will stick his head into my work area occasionally to tell me something funny he read or some such, but never when he can tell I'm in a meeting and he always stays out of camera range just in case I'm on a meeting, but just not talking.  And if I tell him \"Not, now, sorry--I'm busy,\" that's the end up of it.  Your GF is being immature and childish.", "NTA but your guys need to have a boundaries/expectations talk around your WFH needs. It feels like she has never done WFH and cannot figure out that it's still WORK.", "NTA.\n\nWFH is work.  People need to understand that.\n\nI mean, it would've been nice for the two of you together to plan some fun stuff during her week off, but she has to realize that you don't have the week off, so there are some real limits to what you can do.", "NTA\n\nWfh IS work. A few minutes of conversations are ok, lunch breaks are good to spend time with family (or gf here). But, your work boundary should be respected on the same.\nHaving said that, you could have clarified this/talked to her gently the first/second time it happened so she knew what to expect. Letting her disturb you and resenting it silently led it to an explosion which could have been avoided \n\nStill NTA", "NTA for the moment but it's clear work and home can't cohabitate.", " NTA. Your girlfriend is being completely unreasonable. My boyfriend and I both wfh, and we know not to disturb each other during work. Sure, we occasionally talk to each other during work if neither of us is busy, but if we are, he respects my time to work and I respect his.", "NTA overall for wanting your peace when you work but you need to communicate better with her. They way you told her off was very much an asshole move and could've been much nicer. You two need to sit down and talk it out, how you need space, the amount of work that you have and how important it is for her to fully understand, she may just not understand it. \nAlso, you need to chill with your work cause your on the direct road to a burnout. It wouldn't hurt if you actually try to take some breaks here and there.", "NTA.\n\nJust because you\u2019re working at home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not on the clock. Work from home is still being on the clock and is pretty like being in an office with the exception of being in a different enviornment. \n\nYour girlfriend needs to understand that while you are at home, you\u2019re still on the clock", "NTA\n\nYou're at work. This isn't a vacation or time off. She'd be pissed if you came into her work place and kept bugging her all day. You'll get in trouble if you can't focus and complete your work. She doesn't seem to understand that working from home means that, despite being in the home, you're *at work*.", "NTA work is work no matter where you do it. If you were in the office she wouldn\u2019t expect you to talk to her? I think she probably had an expectation that you would slow things down to hang with her, but she shouldn\u2019t have just expected it without telling you.", "NTA - you work from home, which means you should be working. I can understand why she was shocked today though. IMO you should have nipped it in the bud on Monday. When you noticed she assumed you would have time for her during the work day then you should have had an honest conversation with her about your work, the deadlines you are on and that you would not be available to her. The fact that you let her continue to chat with you throughout the week without being honest about your workload and then lost your sh*t on her, I would be upset if I were her too. If you never told her until today, then she had no idea. Communication would have avoided the fight.", "NTA. Simple she is being white rude tbh", "NTA *You're working* she needs to grow up and realize that.", "NTA. You are at work. Your office also happens to be at your home.\n\nMy partner and I both WFH but I\u2019m off this week and he\u2019s mostly not. When he\u2019s working, he\u2019s working, even if we happen to be sitting in the same room. If I want to go to lunch together, that has to be negotiated.\n\nDid she want you to also take this week off? If so, she needs to communicate that ahead of time so you can book PTO. Is work bleeding over for you? Do you spend enough time together outside work hours to meet her needs?", "NTA\nOf course not. But the problem before you is how to help your gf understand and respect your work time while acknowledging her feelings and needs. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nYou're at work. You're working. She should leave you TF alone.\n\nIf you were working in a physical office, and your gf phoned you for an extended chat every day, you'd get told to knock it off, and if you didn't, you'd get fired. The rules don't change just because your office is in your house.", "My job has productivity monitoring for certain roles who are WFH. Someone being interrupted like your GF is doing to you would be in a lot of trouble and would potentially impact everyone who works from home.\n\nThere is a lot of trust that\u2019s comes with WFH and it does stress out old school bosses.\n\nNTA at all", "NTA. Too many people, friends, family and partners, think physically at home means physically and mentally available. BUT I suspect you need to romance her properly outside of working hours, you are not in the clear just because you are in the right.", "NTA. Put on headphones and set up some boundaries. When my BF has his 9/80 Friday off, I often have to remind him that I\u2019m working.", "NTA.  Work from home is still WORK, and you have deadlines to meet.  You can't drop everything for her.  She should learn to treat your WFH situation as if you are at the office.  Point out to her that you wouldn't expect her to leave her job for 90 minutes to drive her sister somewhere (presumably), you can't just get up and leave your job to run long errands just because you are WFH.", "NTA you have completely failed to establish any boundaries with your gf. My husband works from home since 2020. I dont go in his office at all, if I want to speak to him then I will wait until he comes out to go to the loo, or get food or a drink from the kitchen. She needs to understand that you are at work. You need to be firm on your set of rules.", "NTA. Would she drop in at your office to talk to you or rant? She should treat your home office like what it is: your office. She should respect it accordingly.", "NTA. Maybe phrase it like this:  \"If I were at the office right now, what would YOU be doing?\"  When she answers you, say \"then do that, because I AM AT THE OFFICE.  The Office just happens to be HERE right now.\"", "Nta, it's already super annoying when someone tries to talk to you while you work, can't properly concentrate on neither. Why some people treat home offices like a vacation, it actually doesn't matter where the office is, work needs to be done either way. She's acting childish about it, better have a serious talk with her about not disturbing your work time.", "NTA - A lot of people who don't work from home don't quite understand what it entails. I think some have this romantic notion that you can take a break whenever you want. \n\nAlso, some people work in fields that don't have a huge cognitive load, so when you finish one task, you can easily move on to the next. Coding is not like this. The amount of things you need to keep in your head is quite large, and is usually as stable as a house of cards. When you get interrupted unexpectedly, it's not like you can just go back to work. You typically need to rework the whole workflow, re-read elements of the code base etc.  So a 5 minute interruption is actually costing something like 30 minutes of re-boot time.\n\nAs you said, you're basically in the office.  I would offer a compromise and say \"*tell you what, whenever I finish a task, I'll get out of the office and we can chat while I have a coffee, but when I'm in there, please respect my work\"*\n\nHowever, someone saying that you are prioritizing earning a living which allows you to put food on the table and a roof over your head is probably not going to have the proper maturity to understand any of this.", "NTA\n\nYour gf is really immature. Impacting your work, trying to make you feel bad for needing to work your shift, and then the silent treatment?\n\nThis is not an adult that is ready for a healthy relationship. l\n\nYou're gonna have to set a boundary, which means advising her of the consequences and enforcing the consequences.\n\n\"If you can't leave me to my work, I'll be locking the door.\"\n\n\"If you can't leave me to my work, and don't apologize for how you've treated me, then we will need to live separately or break up.\"", "Have you talked to her and set some boundaries regarding your work hours before? Many people WFH and are available to do other things, it\u2019s not always assumed that you\u2019re busy the entire time. I can talk my fianc\u00e9s ear off for an hour while he\u2019s working and it doesn\u2019t matter lol. \n\nIf not, then YTA. Just tell her that you\u2019re busy during work hours. But she clearly just wants to spend time with you. Maybe reserve some time after work to go to dinner or a movie or something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
