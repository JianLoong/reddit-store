Your response seems understandable to me, she IS your sister.  Being a sister does NOT guarantee friendship.  Her invasiveness is unusual.  You would think by the time you turned 19 she *would get the hint*.\n\nHas she always attempted to be this invasive in your personal life?  Is something off in her life?  Was there a time in your life when you were super close with this sister?", "NTA- You need to sit your parents and your sister down and explain what is going on. Tell your sister she is not your parent and she needs to stop telling you what to do. Tell her that her advice is not appreciated. Say it in front of your parents so they know what is going on and will maybe stop calling to TELL you to talk to her.", "Well I guess you could tell her you might want to *become* friends, but that in every friendship there are boundaries that need to be respected. One of which is that, if you feel the need to tell her about things that are going on, you will, but that usually you're not the type to talk about stuff- something like that. And that tattling to your parents isn't going to help in any way. Friendships need to be balanced and that's not going to be what happens if you're faced with a barrage of invasive questions every time you see her.\n\nIt makes even me uncomfortable, reading this.\n\nNTA.", "NA here she\u2019s trying to be both a sister and a friend, she wants that, you don\u2019t, it sounds pretty sad all around.  If you don\u2019t want her in your life maybe tell her so she can move on and not be hurt again", "NTA. She isn't your parent, even if there is that age difference. She needs to accept you as an adult, and for some reason that's hard for her. \n\nI would feel uncomfortable (like you seem to be) that she's putting so much emphasis on managing/guiding you. Is she maybe unhappy about how something is going in her own life and this is her way of feeling in control?", "YTA, as an older sibling with a similar age gap, it can be quite hard to walk the line between \u201cbig sibling\u201d and \u201cparent\u201d, even when you have the best intentions. She may not realize the way it makes you feel. The right way to have handled this would have been to have taken her to the side and had a conversation about the level of involvement you want her to have in your life instead of (as you put it) interrupting her and snapping.", "I'd say NTA, but just barely. Snapping at her was not the ideal thing to do, but I understand your frustration. When she's calmed down, apologize for snapping, but then tell her how you feel about her pestering you. Be real about it, without being rude.", "YTA. It sounds like you've had these feelings about the relationship with your sister for quite a while. Instead of snapping at her, you should have communicated that you were uncomfortable with how the two of you interact ages ago. Proactively setting boundaries with each other can help avoid future conflict. As an older sibling, I can empathize with your sister. It's really hard growing up being a second parent, then one day you realize you don't have the relationship with your siblings you see everyone else having. All my younger siblings get along fantastic, and I feel I will never have that same relationship with them because of the responsibility I had as a child. I hope you are able to talk things out with her, and set the boundaries that are best for the both of you moving forward \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb", "NTA. I think it\u2019s the age difference. Unless your parents have siblings with a similar age gap, they may never understand. You\u2019re NTA and it may take a while before everyone understands your boundaries. Also, I learned later in life that my family used my older sister to learn about what was going on in my life when I was in my early 20s. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with you all but it\u2019s good to look at the whole picture sometimes.", "NTA.   Curious, since she\u2019s older, was she responsible for watching you when you were younger?", "NTA", "Seems to me that, MAYBE, your sister genuinely cares for you and wants the best for you and maybe is being very pushy for thet reason.\n\nIf so, she probably did not realise you did not like it so you saying she is not your friend was hurtful to her. \n\nNTA but please have a good conversation with her where you guys both express eachother\u2019s thoughts.", "NTA.  Stand your ground.  When she starts cut her off. Change the subject, get off the phone or walk away.", "You're kind of the AH on this one. She seems like she genuinely wants a connection with you. Who wouldn't want a positive relationship with family? Don't get me wrong, no one can force you to have a friendship you don't want, but idk this seems over the top for me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My sister (27F) is here too. She calls me and texts me seemingly constantly, always asking me what's going on in my life and trying to tell me what to do. If I ignore her, she complains to my parents until they tell me to talk to her. Still, it's been manageable up til now thanks to the distance / technology combo.

Have you guys ever been close? You\u2019ve got an eight year age gap and I wonder if she feels like you guys missed out on true sibling bonding experiences so now she\u2019s trying to insert herself in your life to make up for it. I have no idea but that\u2019s what you should figure out. \n\nI have a seven year age gap between myself (F) and my younger brother (22) and it requires a bit of balance, but if either of us overstep, we have learned to tell each other to back off, essentially. \n\nYou\u2019re an adult, and I wonder if she thinks she\u2019s providing guidance but doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s unsolicited. Best I can tell you OP is to just ask her why she\u2019s taken such an interest despite you telling her to leave you be. Maybe she does have something going on in her life and this is how she\u2019s processing it. Maybe she truly didn\u2019t realize how overbearing she was being until you snapped. \n\nOh and she might cry again when you tell her to give you some space lol. She\u2019ll be okay though. Set those boundaries. It\u2019s important.", "I may be off.  But gonna take a guess. I bet your older sis and parents talk about you often. And they\u2019ve decided that you\u2019re more likely to say things to and listen to your sis than them. So they\u2019re using your sister to try to control you or guide you and learn what\u2019s going on in your life and basically forcing you to keep talking to her. Sadly this can keep you from having a real relationship with your sister. NTA. I feel they\u2019re all ganging up on you because you\u2019re a little different. But be yourself. Keep your boundaries. There\u2019s good advice here. \n\nI do know I\u2019m making some assumptions after reading this. If I\u2019m way off that\u2019s my bad.", "NTA. At least you can tell her. I can't have a normal heart to heart with mine. I have a little similar situation ( I am 27 and she is 34), we are low contact now. As I always say we have a \"love in a distance\",we live in different cities. She wasn't as enthusiastic as your sister about intruding my life but still will have an uncalled reaction on my responses if they are not what she expected. I still remember how she told me (then 13 and 20) that \" everyone has sisters like sisters and I have you\". Well and I have her. But I prefer the distance. She had her own issues It's just I prefer she resolves without my involvement. When we were young parents would tell me to be 'wiser', equivalent to ' be a bigger person'. I did, but as I grew older I thought ' she is an older sister so she should be an example no? Why should I act like an older one?' parents aren't interfering much now since we are adults with our own families, mom can be upset that we can't be closer but she understands and won't pressure me.", "It\u2019s true that you\u2019re not friends, you\u2019re sisters. You didn\u2019t get to choose each other. \n\nI\u2019m gonna say you\u2019re AH just by using the word \u201cpestering\u201d like she\u2019s a roach and then implying that you get irritated at her texting you all the time. As an older sibling, what she does is just what many older siblings that care about you do. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to talk to her, just don\u2019t then. In the end, don\u2019t expect her to be there for you when you need her.", "Yes she is always this invasive. One time a girlfriend and I broke up and she wouldn't stop calling until I told her all of the details. I told her I didn't want to talk about it but then she called my mom and my mom handed me the phone and told me to talk to her. I have multiple stories like this.\n\nI don't know if something is off in her life. She's always done well in school, she's finishing out med school. My parents and teachers always tell me she is someone to aspire to, so from my perspective she seems like she's doing great, but i don't know about her life on a personal level.\n\nShe was out of the house by the time I hit middle school but she never wanted to hang out with me and would tell me to go away when she was with her friends. I get it though, I don't really hang out with my friend's younger siblings either.", "She might just you know like or care about him.", "I appreciate the advice but they know what's going on", "I don't know, from my perspective her life seems great, but I don't know a lot about her personal life. I do sometimes feel like I'm a surrogate \"do-over\" for her. I've told her I want to make my own mistakes. It's what we were arguing about before the \"as a friend\" comment and subsequent snapping", "can you explain what you mean by taking her to the side - we were alone", "Not that I can remember. I had a couple babysitters. I mean, I'm sure she watched me every so often, but it wasn't a regular thing.", "Oh my Lord!  Your family is practically forcing you to talk with your sister and you have complied.  \n\nYou may have read this before but \"'No' is a complete sentence.\"  In other words you don't have to share details about your personal experiences, life or feelings with *anyone!*  I am 56 yo F, mother of two 20-somethings.\n\nThe important thing about a personal life is that it is *personal*!  Some families feel that all members should share everything... I do not agree.  Sweetheart, you don't owe anyone in your family, or friends any information about yourself.  \n\nYou need to create boundaries, with your family and especially with your sister.  As other people may have mentioned, a therapist can help you... or you can research it on the internet.  Do not go with any advertising sites.\n\nYou need to stay loyal to yourself.  That may or MAY NOT include doing what your parents tell you to do.  You're 19, legally an adult.  Surely there is a diplomatic way to tell your parents *no*.\n\nLast thought: I don't think anything I am suggesting is easy, or simple.  If can achieve personal peace, it will be worth all the effort.  Much affection from afar.", "Maybe she you know cares about you lol", "They need to hammer out some boundaries.  A person on the receiving end of those inquiries should not feel offended.  Something is off in this situation.", "If they know she is trying to parent you and keep insisting you keep in contact, you should have a conversation with your parents about being an adult who does not need to be parented by your sister. Set a boundary that you will have a relationship with your sister when she treats you like an adult. Remind them when they call to complain about you not keeping in touch. Set that boundary all around.", "Given what you've said, you may just have to go low/no contact with everyone for a time to get your point across.  It's harsh, but your folks aren't helping and nothing else is going to get the message across to sister at this point.  NTA--anyone is going to snap after years of harassement.", "Hopefully she just cuts contact and never speaks to you again.", "In other words, have a private and adult conversation where it's just you two and tell her what your needs are.  That you don't like being told what to do and the daily check ins feel a tad invasive.  You have to communicate your needs to someone long before they boil over", "Ah. Didn\u2019t realize that from your description. Either way \u201ctaking her to the side\u201d = bringing this up in a less/non confrontational way.", "Then she apparently needs to have a kid so she can stop trying to mother you.", "thank you", "Then she should care about OP's boundaries. No means no.", "I'd assume so", "just realized you've commented three times on this post alone. are you in a similar situation on the other side, perhaps?", "Yes, when someone repeatedly stomps across your boundaries after you've told them to stop, the solution is to be /less/ assertive. \n\nWtf?\n\n\nOP your sister needs to chill out and run her own life instead of yours.\n\n Definitely NTA", "Got it, thanks", "Probably for the best she cuts contact", "She\u2019ll probably stop now", "Nope just think your sister shouldn\u2019t speak to you again", "Has OP repeatedly told them to stop though? I don\u2019t see that in the post. Just that they try to ignore them.", "Okay it's just... it looks like you made an account specifically to respond to this post multiple times. You seem triggered", "Read more of OP'S comments.", "No I\u2019m agreeing with you. You don\u2019t like or care about your sister and have no desire to have a relationship or even like her. Why on earth should you both talking ?", "Posted *before* I wrote what I did?", "For being OP's sister, you're not doing a very good job of hiding your identity. You went from hearing \"you're not my friend, you're my sister\" to \"well I guess we won't talk to each other ever again\".", "Posted before you replied to me, at the very least.", "NTA\n\nSounds annoying. Try communicating with her properly  though.", "Nta", "YTA for not establishing harder boundaries earlier on.", "Yes you were.  What was she \"pestering\" you about?  Would love to hear her side to see if it was pestering or just being helpful.", "It can be both. It's my first year in college. She wanted to know about my romantic life. I told her I didn't want to talk about it and I want to make my own mistakes. I'm sure she means to be helpful but I don't want it.", "If she cared she would respect OP\u2019s boundaries.  I have much older sibs and parents who often forced them into a parental role with me and even they never over stepped this badly let alone this frequently.  And honestly they took me putting them in their places with much more grace.  Even the extremely emotionally immature one.  They did not run to our parents to make me talk to them after they ticked me off by overstepping.  They had at least that much dignity to fight their own battles with me.  Even if it meant they lost.  \n\nI think the sister needs to take a step back and look at why she is doing this because all she is doing is forcing her sibling to cut ties with her.  This is not appropriate older sibling behavior.  It is obsessive, manipulative, and toxic.  \n\nAnd if anything this \u201ccare\u201d seems to me misdirected anxiety she does not have properly managed that has little to do with OP.  I hope this sister gets the therapy and help she needs before she pushes her brother away forever.  And possibly making OP go low contact with parents if they keep enabling sister by forcing Op to be involved with her.  \n\nAnd this is not about OP not liking or loving the sister.  It is about OP not deserving to be treated this way to make sister feel better.  Bc OP is not an emotional support animal or an emotional punching bag to work out sister\u2019s distress of school or whatever is stressing her out.  It may look like care but care means actually listening and respecting another person\u2019s reasonable wants and needs over your own, within reason.  And this seems reasonable for OP to want these things.  \n\nAlso friends don\u2019t do this either so if sister wants to be a friend she would need to change her behavior and learn to emotionally handle herself better anyway.  \n\nAfter reading many of your comments I truly hope you are not the sister because going on here and saying what you\u2019ve said as his sister would mean your behavior is getting pretty unhinged.  It would mean you are extremely emotionally immature and you need immediate help.  \n\nOP is NTA.  Sister needs to stop being inappropriate with OP and learn to have a healthy more equal sibling relationship.\n\nEdited to add: btw my sibs are 14 and nearly 13 years older than me.", "His sister is overbearing and overstepping and forcing herself into a parental role. That\u2019s a great way to make someone want nothing to do with you. If perhaps she\u2019d shown him friendship of any sort he would have reciprocated."]}
