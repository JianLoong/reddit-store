Thomas is 8 and Hayley is 5. Thomas' best friend is having his birthday party in a couple of weeks. The friends parents sent a note home with Thomas' invite stating that Thomas was invited but not Hayley and they would not allow her to join. This note was sent because the last five or so parties Thomas was invited to, she brought Hayley along uninvited and expected her to be included.\n\nThe last party in particular was a bad one because the parents complained that Hayley had no friends within the group of invitees and was left to play alone (this was at an indoor play space that do parties) and it was more stressful having to watch out for her. Thomas didn't want Hayley hanging off of him the whole party either. He didn't want her there to begin with. But now my sister has built a reputation and parents are getting proactive.\n\nSo my sister called up the parents and asked why Hayley was not allowed to come and how rude could they be to exclude a child. They said Hayley is not their son's friend and is not even in the age group of the other kids and would need to be in a different section of the play space (which is true). She said Hayley might not be his friend but she is family of Thomas and it's rude to invite only some of a family unit. They said they would not accept Hayley into the party or pay for her place.\n\nMy sister was telling me about this and complaining that they were rude. She said maybe Thomas shouldn't go. I told her she was wrong for expecting Hayley to be welcome/invited. I told her she should let Thomas have his fun with his best friend and let Hayley enjoy her day without feeling left out by all the other kids present.\n\nMy sister said I was a jerk for thinking of her in the wrong when she has two kids not one and it should be normal for siblings to be invited to parties. I said the birthday kids sibling is a maybe. But inviting 20 kids to a party could soon be 50 if they all have multiple siblings or come from large families and it would be a lot to expect someone to take on.
