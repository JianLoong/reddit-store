Within a week, I found out the same weekend I moved in, he had gotten himself on Tinder, talked to several different women, and also slept with at least one. Then I found out he was drinking again and also huffing dust cleaner. The same night I discovered he was cheating, he then crashed my car. This was all in one week.\n\nAfter that, he went on to lose his job. There was also a lot more that has gone on, but I'll try to keep this short. Last week, I finally got my car back, and my mother flew in to come get me. My children and I are safe with my parents and thankfully, I was still on maternity leave so my work is taking me back happily. Now here is where I am struggling. \n\nThrough this entire week, he hasn't once asked about our children and has only wanted to talk about how he is suffering because of me.

He is demanding I sell my wedding ring and send him the money so he doesn't get evicted.

Most of all, do NOT give him any money, because he can't handle that money right now.
