When she finally decided to come relive me, she asked \u201ccan you please do my 4 hours for me? I gave her a blank look and said no. Then she went off on a tangent about how her skin isn\u2019t as dark as mine and how she\u2019ll burn alive out there, and how she\u2019s tired from school, mind you this is my second job and I also do school.

If you're angry over this encounter, don't show it.\n\nTell them exactly what happened: the fact that she was late relieving you, what she said, what you said. Don't offer your personal opinion of her. It's unnecessary, because the dialogue speaks for itself, and saying things like \"Whenever she asks anyone for anything, they always do it\" will just make you come across as unprofessional.\n\nWith any luck, Sam will be exaggerating her side of the story and bursting into tears all over again and telling management what an awful person you are for refusing to work her shift. Your calm and professional demeanor will impress management much more than her hysterics.", "NTA.\n\nIf she didn't want to work she shouldn't have taken the job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, yeah, and you didn't make her cry. She chose to start crying because she thought it would get her out of doing something she didn't want to do. I guarantee you it's worked for her before.", "NTA\n\nBut please update us after management gets involved.", "NTA and you may want to talk to them about little miss and what appears to be some, at a minimum, bigoted tendencies. She can\u2019t do her job because she\u2019s such a lily-white flower, unlike you? What the heck\u2026.?", "Nta. She's entitled af", "NTA \n\nI doubt anything is going to come from management. You\u2019ve worked your hours, she asked you to cover hers and you said no, as is your right to. There\u2019s no way you could get into trouble and if you do, you should find a different job.", "NTA, has she never heard of sunscreen?", "NTA, i'd be talking to management about my relief bileing late in hazardous temperatures.", "NTA. \n\n1) If your coworkers really cared, one of them can cover's Sam's shift. \n\n2) This will be a good experience for Sam in *not* getting away with ridiculous nonsense. What kind of entitled person--19 or otherwise--thinks that asking someone to cover an extra 4 hours shift (for no stated reason, mind you) is a reasonable request? \n\n3) Good for you for sticking to your guns. Continue to stick to them.", "NTA, no one should be forced to work for 9 hours in 100+ degree temp.

I wear spf 60+ sunscreen, wear long sleeved tees and lightweight pants, and choose when I spend my time outside. Including jobs. Granted, I do not live in Texas.\n\nThere should (hopefully) be no problem with the inquiry. She asked you to take her shift. You said no. From the way you wrote it, you fulfilled your contracted hours/duties and then some. She is the one that tried to coerce/manipulate you. In fact, you could possibly file your own claim to that effect.\n\nNow if you swore or were threatening in your language or anything, that might be different.", "NTA, your Co-Worker needs to grow-up.", "Nta I would have asked \u201care you really crying because I want to clock out and leave because my shift is over?\u201d I speak to my 2 year old like this. \u201cAre you really crying because I said you can\u2019t hit me?\u201d Even my 2 year old stops crying when I approach him with logic lol", "Nta.

Stay calm, stick to the facts, and remind them you\u2019re also in school and working multiple jobs to support yourself and goals. She sounds like a world class manipulator. Steer clear, say nothing.", "NTA, the fact that she brought up her skin tone is gross. She knows she works outdoors. I've worked 10 hours in the sun and I'm a red head with the typical super pale skin with poor melatonin which dose make me very susceptible to sun stroke and sun burn even with heavy sunscreen. I would never bring up my skin tone as a reason someone else should work my shift last minute. That is just absolutely crazy and gross. Her reaction to just breakdown and cry is so unprofessional. If she wanted to make it reliant on someone else, then she should have just called out and made it her managers issue. She knew what she's doing I'm sure she's tried to make it out that she was the good person in letting someone cover her shift appropriately. \n\nWhen you meet with management stick to the facts. The facts of exactly what she said then exactly what you said. You can apologize that you weren't more professional when holding your boundary. You've been thinking about how you can respond more professionally if something similar occurs in the future. Even ask how they would like you to respond differently. You don't wanna portray that you didn't like her previously to this encounter.", "NTA - Hell no! I live in Texas and we hit 112 degrees today. It\u2019s a miserably hot summer here. \n\nYour co-worker was scheduled to work and she needs to work. When management interviews you, keep you answers short and low key. Keep your personal opinions of her (and perhaps a little jealousy) to yourself. Keep your voice quiet and professional. Skin color has nothing to do with it-she should work. Good luck!", "NTA. Give her sunscreen and leave", "NTA. I\u2019m the palest person I know, I swear I could get moonburn XD it\u2019s not an excuse not to do my job. She\u2019s an adult, as you said, so she needs to grow up and deal with it. You don\u2019t always get your way in life, those tears aren\u2019t going to get her very far. Why should you have to pick up the slack? If there are interviews, I would take a union member or a trusted witness with you to make sure you aren\u2019t ganged up on. If they still try to do that, take it higher (if possible) to people who don\u2019t know either of you and will look at the facts rather than go off their opinions of you or her.", "NTA for declining the extra shift. The crying was not your fault.\n\nBonus points for spelling \"bawling\" correctly!", "NTA. She needs to grow the fuck up.", "They sell shirts with sun protection \n\nSend her a link\n\nNTA she sounds awful", "As a Texan, I don't blame you.  Not only that, but for anyone to expect you to work overtime because she can't handle the heat.  Well then, she should move up north.  We don't need cry babies here that can't handle the heat.   \n\nAlso, if this is THE TEXAS grocery chain, it is my understanding that corporate doesn't want you guys outside too long. One of the individuals who returns the carts told me they are only allowed outside for a set amount of time.  Even personal shoppers are only allowed a set amount of time.\n\nAs for the big chain with the smiley face, I was told they are only sent out when carts are low.  As for the personal shoppers, I was told that they are also restricted on how long they are outside.  \n\nAre these people crazy.

Like others said, stick to the facts keeping opinion and conjecture out of it. Let them know she was supposed to relieve you at a certain time. You saw her arrive and go inside. She came out to relieve you 30 min later than she was supposed to. When she asked you to cover her 4 hours, you said no. Let them know about the comment she made regarding your skin. The only thing that may become an issue is you saying to her \u201cYou\u2019re grown. Figure it out\u201c. It\u2019s never great to have appeared snarky to a coworker. I hope your meeting goes well. Good luck!", "NTA - make sure in the interview you let them know that her tardiness to relieving you almost put the company in a lunch break violation.\n\nAlso check on laws regarding working outside. I know CA has some for farm workers.", "NTA\n\nSounds like this is a management problem that should have been taken care of long before now.\n\nNot your problem not your responsibility. You did your time.", "NTA. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. You've already worked your shift, plus 30 minutes. You were hot and tired. I'd have told her the same thing, but less nice.

Also, tell the people in the group chat that any of them could have covered and make sure you tell management you will not cover for someone who acts entitled.  Also, if yiu have an hr I would report her recism.", "NTA that is highly manipulative behavior. She's not used to hearing no, so her response is to burst into tears. To try to make you feel bad so you cave to her demands, and to make it look like you were being hurtful to her to your coworkers. That is absolutely not ok.", "NTA. Oh, hell no. She was supposed to relieve you but didn't? Expected you to essentially work a double shift, in the heat? So long as you weren't openly rude or verbally abusive to her, no way were you the asshole.", "Make sure you tell them every thing that was said. Tell them \u201cshe stated she wanted me to work her shift because her skin wasn\u2019t as dark as mine and she would burn. Also that she was tired from school\u201d. Tell them exactly what you said word for word. You didn\u2019t say anything wrong or mean but showing your honest will go along way.", "Good luck tomorrow and stand your ground. Stay confident you are not in the wrong one bit. The skin colour comment is troubling because what does she mean, she doesn\u2019t wanna burn implying just because you\u2019re black you don\u2019t burn in the sun? And your coworkers calling you the asshole and making you feel bad just gives me the vibe they\u2019re discriminating against you, because you stood your ground and didn\u2019t let the poor little white girl crying victim win and get her way. I would bring up the group chat also in the meeting.", "NTA.\nI agree, just the facts ma'am. You can state that your outside time was over and that you did not want to pick up her portion. You could state that if there was a reason for her not relieving you, it was your understanding that  she should have brought her issues to a manager who could have made that call. You can apologize for your choice of words and promise to be more professional in the future, asking what management would suggest as the ideal way to handle the situation. You, of course, can hate your co-worker with every fiber of your being, just don\"t show it.", "Tell them about the racial comment she made about your skin.

Bringing out the groceries is the worst, especially when it is so hot outside. The only time I relieved someone\u2019s shift was when they broke they broke their foot lol. You taking that 30 minutes was generous.", "Bring up the fact that she used your skin color as part of her excuse to not do her shift, if they talk to you.", "NTA. If you're POC and she's white, sounds like she might have been weaponizing white woman tears. She's manipulating the situation to make her look like the victim and you like the aggressor. The tears center her feelings, rather than the facts. Stay calm and stay factual when you meet with management.", "NTA what sort of defence is \u201cmy skins not as dark as yours\u201d? That just means you\u2019re hotter than her (temperature wise) during work.", "This 100%.\n\nFacts only. Short, simple statements. Answer yes/no.

I\u2019m a little scared, not going to lie, i have never been in trouble at work. I kept track of the time that things happened because I knew when I saw that she was reliving me, she might try to pull something like this.

But remind yourself that you've done well in keeping calm so far.\n\nIf the conversation you posted above is accurate, then you didn't shout at Sam, you didn't say \"How dare you!\", you didn't yell at her for being late, you didn't accuse her of racism, you didn't accuse her of manipulating people into getting what she wants. You weren't super polite, but I think your response was fair, and you certainly weren't rude or unprofessional.\n\nSo all you need do is keep up this demeanor tomorrow. Even if you're feeling nervous, tell yourself \"They don't know I'm nervous, and I'm not going to show it.\"\n\nI'm reasonably confident that this interview will go well for you.\n\nIf the worst happens and it doesn't: well, you have another job, you have school, so you probably have your sights set on higher things. I've been treated unfairly at work more than once. I moved on to much better jobs and left those people far, far behind.\n\nGood luck.", "Agree with the comment you replied to. I would add that you felt disrespected by the skin pigment comment, and if you are uncomfortable working with her going forward because of it, I would say so, but respectfully to your supervisor, because you are sticking with facts. Having a feeling is a fact, but acting out because of it probably won\u2019t get you the result you want.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re actually in trouble.
