I would never bring up my skin tone as a reason someone else should work my shift last minute. That is just absolutely crazy and gross. Her reaction to just breakdown and cry is so unprofessional. If she wanted to make it reliant on someone else, then she should have just called out and made it her managers issue. She knew what she's doing I'm sure she's tried to make it out that she was the good person in letting someone cover her shift appropriately. \n\nWhen you meet with management stick to the facts. The facts of exactly what she said then exactly what you said. You can apologize that you weren't more professional when holding your boundary.

We don't need cry babies here that can't handle the heat.   \n\nAlso, if this is THE TEXAS grocery chain, it is my understanding that corporate doesn't want you guys outside too long. One of the individuals who returns the carts told me they are only allowed outside for a set amount of time.  Even personal shoppers are only allowed a set amount of time.\n\nAs for the big chain with the smiley face, I was told they are only sent out when carts are low.

In addition to other redditors words about the interview, I would like to add that should everything go well with the interview, expect that you will be the most hated person thanks to the antics of Sam.
