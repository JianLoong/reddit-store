I hope your daughter dumps this asshat soon!", " NTA sounds like he\u2019s a user and she needs to drop him. Does she have low self esteem?", "NTA. You're being insanely reasonable. I don't know anyone whose parents would still let them borrow the car to drive to work if they let some uninsured, possibly unlicensed AH drive their car! \n\nSeriously, the fact your daughter isn't thanking you on bended knee seems mad to me, add that she actually tried to call you out?? Madness. \n\n>I have a feeling he\u2019s been driving it a lot more than I\u2019ve seen.\n\nThis just makes it so much worse! How are you such a chill mom? He's definitely been driving it loads though if they're already at the stage where he'll do it to the house, and your daughter knows you have a porch cam.", "NTA and you're getting some great advice.  Start low tech by checking the odometer before she goes to work and start logging the numbers every evening when she gets home. Within a day or two you'll know if the car is being used while she's at work. Next step is to either add some sort of nonApple tracking device OR if you are free during the day drive to her workplace and see if the car is there. \n\nIf it's true that someone is using the car while she's at work, tell her she has one week to find other transportation or find a job she can walk to or take the bus.  (You may want to purchase some sort of immobilization device like a steering wheel lock.)\n\nWhen the bf can't use her car -- and if she buys a car she won't have extra money for him to sponge which makes it likely he'll move on to the next mark. You could even \"sell\" her the second car as long as she makes (sizeable) weekly payments.  That would be less cash flow for the bf to sponge and when he's out of the picture you'd be able to return the car to her and stop taking the payments if you'd like. \n\nAs many have pointed out here the insurance is actually a HUGE issue and you could end up literally losing EVERYTHING.", "Nta", "NTA. Your car, your rules.", "Nta If you do see it moving around while your daughter is at work, be sure and report it stolen. Nothing kills a romance like felony charges.", "NTA.  Big nope if that car sharing.  I\u2019d shit that down ASAP", "NTA! This is a hard no", "NTA", "NTA. Tell her it\u2019s not a big deal to *her* but it is a massive big deal to *you,* the *owner* of said vehicle that you only gave *her* express permission for *her* to drive. She does not get to transfer this permission at her whim because it\u2019s *not her car.*", "NTA. If he drives it without your permission, call the po-po!", "NTA first, the car isn\u2019t hers to ask him to go to the store for her. Second, if he\u2019s using her for the car, that is something she needs to see.  What other alternative ways for her to get to work could she have if you take the car? \nCan she afford to Uber? Maybe split the cost for her?", "NTA, you are liable for what happens with a car that is in your name not matter who is driving it.  WTF is wrong with her that she makes a list of red flags and stays with the guy.  The big issue is that at 1:30 is has to go get beer and takes your car.  It is not like he is going to the all-night pharmacy to get some medications he all of a sudden needed.  How much had he had to drink before he left for the beer.", "NTA. It's your vehicle that you gave her permission to drive, not him. I would be very skeptical of letting your daughter drive it even \"just to work\" as they will likely find a way for him to continue using it.

Good luck.", "NTA, it's your car, you choose who has permission to drive it.\n\nDaughter = yes\nSleazy-sounding bf = nope\n\nIf she can't respect that, taking away her access too is a reasonable precaution.", "YTA\n\nShes 22.

She are letting a person with a cavalier attitude towards other people's property use a motor vehicle you're legally/financially responsible for.

NTA", "She will get notified that an AirTag is following her so it may defeat the purpose. \n\nRegardless, I would be all over the insurance aspect. If he hurts someone, you\u2019re likely liable.

Your daughter needs to grow up.", "Why don\u2019t you be an adult and tell her not to lend it to her bf, instead of punishing her for not being able to read your mind?  \n\nYTA", "I'm not sure how it works in the US, but in the UK if this situation happened and he crashed the car then you would claim it as stolen under your insurance and you would still get it paid out.

Or using a Tile if daughter and fleabag are both iPhone users so it doesn't show up on their Find My apps.

I wish you and your daughter the best! She may not react positively, but at least she'll know you're on her side.

It's an emotional reaction and even if she knows the right thing to do is dump him, she probably won't want to hear it.   \nI dumped my dirt bag bf, I knew it was the right thing and he was an abusive mooching bum, and it was completely my decision, and I still took weeks to go through with it and cried for weeks afterward.  \nAll you can do is talk to her without judgement", "[removed]", "It's as little as 10 days in some places!
