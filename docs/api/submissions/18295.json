If he gets in an accident and the insurance company discovers he was allowed to drive the car on a regular basis without informing them, they will probably deny coverage (and they will certainly deny coverage if he is driving without a license).

This can go wrong in so many ways, especially since he doesn\u2019t even have the respect to ask you to use your own car.

The AirTag is a great idea for monitoring that. Have you checked the mileage on it?  \n\nYou are def NTA here. Your daughter is though. She has shown complete disregarded for your wishes. It is not her car to do with as she pleases. She has demonstrated that she does not adhere to your rules and limitations on its usage. In fact, when confronted she double down and blames this conflict on you- you're just mean. If it is truly a car that you love and do not want to see damaged, I would second-guess allowing her to borrow it.

If OP said one of their cars was 20 years old but they kept it for their child to drive, maybe I\u2019d say she should sell it.

She recognizes he's not a great guy (seriously, writing down a list of his red flags?) but is now all of a sudden protecting him from you. Have you noticed any other behavioral changes? Going out with friends less, staying in more, things like that? I think it may be worth having a good heart-to-heart conversation with your daughter about him.

The app is great.", "She's 22 and shouldn't have to share her location.
