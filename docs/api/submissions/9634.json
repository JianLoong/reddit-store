To keep it short I have bad asthma and was hospitalized for 5 days and had just gotten back home.\n\nMy sister (23F) picked me up from the hospital because my mom (52F) Dad (60M) and my step dad (67M) were all at work. \n\nI was just so happy to be home and shower and get back to normal after the whole ER and hospital experience. My step-dad came home from work and greeted me and was happy that I got back home (he gets home from work before my mom). Some time after I get a call from my mom, she wants to buy pizza for us since I\u2019m back home. She tells me to tell step-dad to order pizza from Costco (so she can pick it up on the way home), I misinterpreted what she meant and thought she meant me to ask him to go get the pizza from Costco himself. Also I thought it was weird that she was calling me to tell him something when she could have just called him directly (this will be important later)\n\nI end the call and go to my parents bedroom where he is. I tell him what I thought I was supposed to \u201chey [step-dad] I hope this isn\u2019t a bother but mom asked if you could go get pizza from Costco.\u201d He retorts \u201cno, what? I just got home. Is your mom still on the phone? Damn\u201d I just say \u201cI\u2019m sorry the call ended but you can call her back if you want\u201d\n\nI hear him leave to his car then come back in. My cousin is in the living room with her kids because their school buss drops them off near my house so they are always there after school, I myself am in my bedroom just resting being back from the hospital. He starts talking trash about me to my cousin saying \u201cOP screwed up big time. He really messed things up. Wtf. He really didn\u2019t understand what was up.\u201d \n\nNow this is where I may be TA, I didn\u2019t intend to call him out but I caused him to call himself out actually. I came out and loudly said \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the miscommunication\u2026\u201d he interrupts \u201cyeah you screwed up big time dude!\u201d So I interrupt, \u201cif mom wanted to speak to you directly she should have called you directly\u201d to which he responds quietly \u201cI left my phone in the car.\u201d I give a sassy \u201cunhhuh right that\u2019s why.\u201d As I go back into my room and close the door.\n\nI tell my mom about the situation and she\u2019s on my side saying that he shouldn\u2019t have been saying those things especially to family when I\u2019m right in the next room. She\u2019s also glad I stood my ground against him. \n\nWe then have dinner and I see that he\u2019s being standoffish he\u2019s more serious than normal. He\u2019s still addressing me but only minimally. \n\nMy stepdad has been giving me the silent treatment since. I said good morning to him this morning as he was on his way out to work and he completely ignored me. I mean it\u2019s easy to see he\u2019s an AH but that doesn\u2019t necessarily exclude me from also being an AH in the situation. Could I have handled it better?\n\nEdit: I must mention my mom did call my stepdad before she called me.\n\nEdit: he didn\u2019t actually go to Costco. He got to his car called my mom, cleared the misunderstanding, came back inside, and started to talk about me to my cousin and her kids.\n\nEdit: I do play rent, and as mentioned before the pizza was to celebrate me coming back from a 5 day hospital visit.\n\nEdit: his 30 year old son (my step brother) also lives with us and pays less rent then me because I have a better job. Idk why that would matter to people so much but I guess it does matter.\n\nEdit: again idk why this matters. It\u2019s my mothers house, she built it from scratch and since he was renting and didn\u2019t own a home he moved in with his kids when they got married. They\u2019ve always acknowledged that it\u2019s her house and not his. All the comments about me living in my step-dads house are assuming that he\u2019s the main provider. He\u2019s not. In either case this post isn\u2019t about our living situation.\n\nEdit: idk why this matters but they got married 2020 so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been my stepdad since I was a child or anything.", "created_utc": 1676036075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ys4z5/aita_for_calling_out_my_step_dad_in_front_of/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to chill. \n\nNTA in normal conditions, even more with the context that you just got out of the hospital. Step dad should be a little more supportive.", "Is no one going to mention that OP had to stay at the hospital for 5 days?\n\nHe started at ER and it was deem serious enough that he was hospitalized. \n\nNTA\n\nThe mom was buying pizza to celebrate his coming home from the hospital ffs. \n\nHis stepdad couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t do a minor thing as go pick up pizza. When it was found to have been a miscommunication the stepdad went off complaining with his cousin and kids? How emotionally mature is the stepdad to have what seems like a tantrum for a miscommunication from someone who just got home from the hospital?", "NTA, shit happens.\n\nYou may have screwed up. Even though miscommunication is inevitable if you go trough a middle man....\n\nBut he should talk behind your back, it's good to call him out on that", "so a simple miscommunication caused by him leaving his phone in the car so no one could contact him directly, that was fixed within _minutes_ of him _getting_ his phone so he didn\u2019t even leave the house to actually go anywhere, is cause for him to come in ranting and raving about how _YOU_ screwed up? \n\nNTA. your stepdad was making a mountain out of a molehill and to your younger family members who absolutely do _not_ need to be involved in that stuff. your mom even sided with you, as she should have, because stepdad was just being a total ass for no reason. you didn\u2019t do anything wrong here, it was a misunderstanding that got cleared up pretty much instantly. stepdad is just mad over something that wouldn\u2019t have happened at all if he hadn\u2019t forgotten his phone in the first place.", "INFO: You \u201creally messed things up\u201d and you \u201cscrewed up big time\u201d? What am I missing here (after having read your post for 3 times now\u2026)", "NTA. That is a ludircrous level of dramatics for him to throw over a minor miscommunication, which means his gigantic emotional displays have nothing to do with anything you did. He wanted to throw emotional fits in a dramatic fashion, he wanted you to be the target/scapegoat for  his drama, and this was the only thing he could come up with. None of it has anything to do with you.", "NTA.   He's a drama king.", "NTA\n\n\nHe felt the need to power trip and got checked.,...and is now sulking lol.", "Your stepdad is such a colossal a-hole that the shadow of his a-holery casts a dark cloud over everything.  If spending a few minutes in his car and on the phone realizing your innocent mistake sums up to a \"screw up . . . big time\" it paints the picture of your step-dad living in a world in which nothing bad ever happens to him . . . or the more likely thing . . . he is such a perpetually entitled and negative person that he is the victim in everything and everyone else is always wrong.  For God's sake you just got home from a 5-day stay in the hospital and he is such a selfish person that he throws a tantrum for an innocent misunderstanding, trash-talks you to your family intentionally within earshot and continues his intimidation tactic with the silent treatment.  What an a-hole.", "ESH  You all made a big deal out of a misunderstanding that got cleared up in a few minutes. You should both try seeing things from each other's point of view.  You just got back from the hospital. He just got home from work & didn't want to go out again.   \n\nThis isn't only about you, but I wish people who say, \"I pay rent\", would qualify that with, \"I pay market level rent\", the same rent they would pay for a house share with that number of people, or \"I pay rent but only a nominal amount\" or \"I pay rent but far less than I would pay for my own place\".  All rent payments aren't equal, and paying your parents rent that is far less than what a stranger would charge you, isn't a magic ticket that allows you to be rude to the people you live with.", "YTA geeze the guy worked all day, you did screw up, admit it apologize and move on. Your jab at him was uncalled for, you live under their roof at 25, grow up and act like an adult.", "YTA for posting this. This is not a conflict. This was just a miscommunication that was cleared up before the 'mistake' even played out fully. It's not even worth the energy that y'all are putting into it. He wasn't even trash talking behind your back - he was fresh off of solving the mistake YOU created and just reacting to it. YOU weren't listening to what your mother actually said, YOU sent your stepdad on a wild goose chase - and he was able to catch it in time. ALL of you suck for making an Almost-Mistake into a Real Argument.  This is not the end of the world, there are a lot of worse things out there that are way more worthy of fighting about.", "ESH    You are right, it was miscommunication and you seem to have doubled-down unnecessarily and you knew it at the time.   Now he's hurt after having actually been glad to see you home and healthy while you are uncomfortable with the way he took things.   You know that the answer is to talk it out.   At the very least you can tell him that you are uncomfortable with getting the silent treatment and ask him if there is more to it than the pizza miscommunication.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
