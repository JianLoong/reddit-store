The counselor was out of line, both in caving right away to a request that could have had another solution and in undermining the luggage crew perks (good luck getting more luggage crew next time, counselor).\n\nIf the other girl has issues sitting next to boys, that's something that needs to be addressed with her one on one to explore whether the counselors need to watch that elsewhere on the tour. She might have just been crying wolf because those were not the boys she wanted to sit next to. In any case, it is very much not your problem. I hope you enjoyed you solo ride.", "NTA. Her issues are her problems. The situation is not unsafe for her and you had a deal", "NTA, you were promised something by the organization and they tried to strong arm you into giving it up, I would write to their complaint department about the counselor who should either disband this little agreement if they cave under pressure or they need to be firm about luggage crew being able to keep their own seats", "NTA you earned that seat and she wasn\u2019t in danger", "NTA. Tell her to join luggage crew if she wants her own seat. \nGood for you for standing your ground. If she can't sit with boys/men, why is she on a co-ed trip?", "NTA - your labour got you that privilege and it should not be removed just becasue you are a girl - because that is essentially  what it comes down to.  Shame on the counsellor for assuming you would be the people pleaser instead of finding a way that did not automatically  disadvantage you.", "NTA- the empty seat was payment for the work you did loading everyone else\u2019s bags. \n\nThere were other options for the girl, everyone just wanted to take the lazy way out and make you share.

It can get incredibly infuriating when just because you\u2019re a girl you\u2019re expected to be \u201cnice\u201d and give up things you\u2019ve earned for no discernible reason than your gender. The counselor is FOS imo.", "NTA,  She probably didn't think those 3 boys were cool enough for her  and so she didn't want to sit next to them.  You earned an empty seat and you deserve it.", "NAH - She asked the wrong person to share seats with, and once the right person was found the problem was solved. You don't get to decide if someone is valid for feeling uncomfortable, you could have just made it about wanting your own seat that you earned. But you had to be assertive to avoid getting walked over and she'll probably get over it. Just don't assume you know how comfortable people are, it's not up to you to decide how she feels.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was the adult in the group who should have found a solution to this problem without pressuring either of the teenage girls into an uncomfortable situation or into giving up an agreed upon perk.
