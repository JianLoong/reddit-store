Tell her to join luggage crew if she wants her own seat. \nGood for you for standing your ground. If she can't sit with boys/men, why is she on a co-ed trip?", "NTA - your labour got you that privilege and it should not be removed just becasue you are a girl - because that is essentially  what it comes down to.  Shame on the counsellor for assuming you would be the people pleaser instead of finding a way that did not automatically  disadvantage you.", "NTA- the empty seat was payment for the work you did loading everyone else\u2019s bags. \n\nThere were other options for the girl, everyone just wanted to take the lazy way out and make you share.

You don't get to decide if someone is valid for feeling uncomfortable, you could have just made it about wanting your own seat that you earned.

Instead, they targeted another girl to give up your earned privilege to \"solve their problem.\" Were any of the guys on luggage duty asked to give up their solo seats to meet someone else's preference? One of those guys sitting alone could have been moved to sit with a luggage crew guy and princess could sit by herself. There's a whiff of sexism in this.", "NTA. You were promised your own seat.

You don\u2019t think she could have been uncomfortable because one or more of those boys had been inappropriate with her?  Because that\u2019s the first thing I would have thought.  I hope you are never in a similar position.  It would be a shame if circumstances forced you to gain some empathy that you don\u2019t naturally have.", "Awesome on you for being that young, female, and standing up for yourself. Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m in my mid-30\u2019s now and only in the last few years have I learned to be assertive. As a 15yo I would\nhave never had the guts to set and maintain those boundaries. You Zoomers are just so cool.", "NTAH if she really had anxiety about this, she would have made sure she was sitting with a girl. It would be different if this was a girl who obviously had a bad experience, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that.

That counselor just likes to enable manipulative shits.", "First thing that came to mind for me is that she may have experienced sexual trauma in her life, unfortunately. Or some type of abuse.

There were other solutions though. Like you said, she could've asked someone else. The boys sitting alone could've just sat together and she could've sat there, your counciller could've offered their seat.\n\nYou had a deal and worked for you chair as a perk  so you saying no is perfectly fair.

Did you call the counselor names? Did you start throwing things? No. A third party even saw what was happening and probably volunteered because she could see you were right - if she were pit crew she'd want her reward seat too. \n\nINFO: what kind of cool talent do you have or contest did you win to be able to go on this tour? It sounds really great.", "NTA. I command you for advocating for yourself. You said no.

The same rule should apply to you as it does to the boys. The counsellor could have asked one of the boys to share with another boy.", "NTA. I'm assuming there were are counselors on the trip. I would talk to one of them, whichever one seems the most reasonable, and tell them what happened. That you don't appreciate the other counseling offering up your seat when you are on luggage crew.", "Something to bare in mind as a general good practice. \nIf someone says they're uncomfortable around men, please don't question it.\nIf they're lying for some reason sure that sucks, but you don't know what that reason could be.", "Essentially you paid for an \"upgrade\" with labor and were expected to sacrifice your comfort for someone else to be comfortable.  \nNTA", "NTA. Great job advocating for yourself.  The counselor decided it would be less work to make *you* solve the problem, by giving up your family earned benefits. That is lazy and unfair. Never stand for that treatment.", "Technically you are in the right but the perception of everyone is going to be that YTA so that is my vote.

Maybe that\u2019s just me but that\u2019s the feel I get.\n\nNTA- there were multiple options for fixes. The adult in charge didn\u2019t even try to find one, just assumed the woman who put in extra work solely for a perk should be willing to give up the perk the second it mildly inconveniences anyone else.", "The girl asking to see to switch seats is \"fine talking about her crushes\" She no problems being around guys.

She didn\u2019t want to sit with *those* boys in particular.", "When another girl doesn\u2019t want to be near males, you need to be her ally.
