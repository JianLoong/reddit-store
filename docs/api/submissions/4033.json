I get home and I just want to relax but I can\u2019t.\n\nMy daily schedule is that I\u2019m up at 540 to leave the house at 610 to get to work at 730, I don\u2019t even have time for breakfast, it\u2019s a long travel time because I don\u2019t drive currently - I put up with it as they\u2019re training me in my L3 qualification in hopes I can further  my career, I like the school I work at and whilst the travel time is bothersome I love it; I finish work roughly 430, sometimes later depending on paperwork/how long it takes to tidy up the nursery so I\u2019m usually home around 7, which isn\u2019t too late if I didn\u2019t have to cook or walk the dog.\n\nSIL texted me on my break one day last week  \u201ccan I come round?

He's still firmly tied to mommy's apron strings. And you absolutely have the right to decide who's involved with YOUR OWN CHILD.", "NTA \nYour boyfriend is an inconsiderate prick. What is he going to do when you are 7-8 months pregnant and really need help? Say it\u2019s your chore too? What is he going to do when the baby is there? He is the Red Flag. His family too. They asked you. You gave an perfectly fine answer and they ignored it anyway.", ">He said they\u2019re his family, they don\u2019t have to ask to come around especially since he would\u2019ve said yes anyway and they had no duty to cook for me especially since they don\u2019t know when I\u2019m home.\n\n>Boyfriend says his ma told him it\u2019s a red flag that I have to give him permission to have family around, that I should fix my work schedule for the baby anyway.\n\n\nYou know who is the red flag? Your boyfriend and his family. They 100% should ask to come over and you BOTH should agree on it. I don't see how not knowing when you'll be home means they can't leave over whatever they ate in a tupperware for you, do they not eat leftovers ever? And how exactly does he propose you \"fix your work schedule\"? \n\nYou need to have a serious discussion with your boyfriend before this baby is born. NTA.", "NTA - your bf and his family are giving of red flags here. YOU ARE GROWING A WHOLE PERSON. You're going to need him to do more while you're pregnant, and if he isn't doing his bit now, how can you rely on him when there's a tiny human depending on you both for their survival? Honestly, what do you get out of this relationship, and are you sure you want to raise a kid that thinks this family's behaviour is normal and ok? It isn't.", "They're one of those families. Imo NTA you're the pregnant one, clearly working full time and having it hard as it it. Your boyfriend should be more catering towards you and understanding. Family should always ask to come round, it's not just the boyfriends house it is also yours and things like that should be arranged. You cannot be expected to come in cheery from working especially when no food was cooked for you and yet you are still expected to clean up! To me they're the red flag!", "NTA and it\u2019s clear that his family is intentionally trying to exclude you. If your bf can\u2019t see that, might be a sign of bigger problems down the road.", "NTA. You're not trying to prevent him from seeing family. You declined having them visit due to being tired and not wanting to visit. And so they came anyway and made a meal but not enough leftovers for you to have when you got home? And then BF wanted you to clean up? Wtf is that about?", "NTA. That is an unusually f\u2019ed up scene. I don\u2019t understand why she bothered to ask you if she wasn\u2019t going to listen to your wishes. And did he tell you it was your turn to clean up in front of them? If so, that feels like a power move effectively humiliating you in front of his family. If you didn\u2019t get to eat the dinner, you don\u2019t need to clean up. Especially not in this scenario. I also think it\u2019s high drama that you \u201ckicked everyone out\u201d but it\u2019s clear that this has pushed you to the brink so I can\u2019t totally fault you for going bonkers on them. You and he have a bit of an age gap. I\u2019m concerned that he hasn\u2019t grown much in the 3 years that you\u2019ve been together. This just sounds like so much childish, thoughtless behavior on his part. Though I also can\u2019t imagine telling his family, \u201cdon\u2019t come here.\u201d Is it possible that you two can get couples therapy? If you didn\u2019t have a baby on the way, I\u2019d say that the two of you have gone different directions.", "NTA. You have every right to have a say in who is in your own home and when. The fact that his family has so easily convinced him that your opinion and wants shouldn\u2019t count is the red flag to me. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s so unfeeling and unsupportive. \n\nThe icing on the cake is that they apparently didn\u2019t have any obligation to make food for you (while they were making their own), but that you had an obligation to clean up after the meal you didn\u2019t get to have any of? Horrible.", "NTA and what in the actual F.  That whole family is a red flag. YOu need to set some boundaries with all of them. And I'll be damned if I'm washing the dishes after they messed up the kitchen and didn't even cook for me? My chore? nope. I'm not the maid.\n\nINFO: did you have to make your own meal that night?", "NTA, he can clean up after them at the least. \n\nIt\u2019s a red flag that he thinks your job is to serve his family and keep sweet.", "NTA. How can your BF be so stupid to not notice how tired you are? I mean if he is that excited ro be a dad, he should be the one that helps the chore around the house in the majority. And if he is smart, he wouldn't invite his family to the house and let you clean up the mess.", "NTA- Does he not care about how you feel? You\u2019re the pregnant one going through all the sickness, emotions and hard work schedule. Why is there no compassion for you?", "NTA  But him and his family currently are the very definition of controlling AH's   This is your home as well.  They called you said \"NO\" and they showed up anyway?   And then your boyfriend watched you clean up their mess?   You are getting a full preview of what it will be like after the baby arrives.", "You\u2019re in your first trimester-which is the time when most pregnant women are exhausted. You put in a long day at work, came home to no dinner cooked for you, but expectations that you clean up the kitchen. They said they were celebrating the baby, but couldn\u2019t bother to leave food for the person growing the baby? A 50/50 split on chores is not fair either. First of you need more rest due to the pregnancy and secondly your BF doesn\u2019t have have a commute - and you are traveling 3 hours a day. With that work schedule your BF should have dinner ready when you get home. NTA- but your BF - and his family is.", "NTA.\n\nYou live with your boyfriend, not his family. Imo this is opening the door to have very little regards for your need just after the birth and the hectic sleeping schedule that probably awaits you.\n\nIf your boyfriend wants to entertain guests he has to do the extra chores that come with that and you might help if you feel like it.", "NTA.\n\nShared home = shared decisions about guests. Obviously both people have to be reasonable within that. If you're feeling unwell/exhausted that's absolutely reason enough to say \"not now\".\n\nTheir message about celebrating with your bf specifically was odd. How did they expect that to go down? Did they really think that you, exhausted and putting your body through all the physical changes to grow this baby, would want it implied that the dad is the only one celebrating? Sheesh.\n\nYour bf's rigidity with house tasks is absurd. Nobody should expect their partner to clean up after a gathering that they weren't involved with. These aren't shared dishes from a shared evening. Even if they were, he chose to insist you upkeep this task rather than recognising that the woman carrying the baby and working long hours might just need to be cut a bit of slack? \n\nYeah, NTA, OP.", "NTA.  \n\nI understand your BF wanting to have dinner with his family but, you had already said no, AND they left the dishes for you, which is rude AF.", "NTA And tbh he would be my ex boyfriend. Because he's perfectly willing to treat you like a servant. Are you sure you want to be tied to this man and his family for life?", "NTA. You had an awful day. You wanted to relax. That's not too much to ask. And as far as asking permission to have people over, it's your house too. You should both have a say in who comes over. I'm sure that your boyfriend would want to have a say if you were trying to bring people over. They think having to ask permission is a red flag, yet they still asked you if they were okay to come over. They only said it was a red flag since they got the answer they didn't want.", "Boyfriend is a walking red flag. NTA and I would get out before this is your life forever.", "\u201cHis ma told him it\u2019s red flag\u201d\u2026\n\nYour boyfriend doesn\u2019t care about you. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA - Splitting chores is great, when you are creating the need for them equally. Why should you have to do dishes for a meal you weren\u2019t involved with at all? Also pregnancy, by it\u2019s nature is going to very disproportionately burden you, he would ideally be taking on more then 50% of the chores during this time. It\u2019s a red flag when people pretend to ask for permission when they are going to ignore your wishes anyway.", "NTA. They came over, made a mess, didn't even leave you leftovers, and expect you to clean after them. You have a giant boyfriend problem.", "NTA. I have a feeling the mother is going to be one that barges in the delivery room too. You should get out while you still can.", "NTA - time for some boundaries!", "NTA. It was rude of them to leave the dishes for you when they didn\u2019t even have the decency to make food for you. If they weren\u2019t sure when you were coming home your boyfriend could\u2019ve asked, even if you were coming home later and they wanted to eat earlier they should\u2019ve left a plate for you.", "Oh my goodness. NTA. But you need to address this now, or you\u2019ll face a lifetime of being treated like trash. The first trimester is brutal, and you Ned the support of your partner. You don\u2019t have it. Is this how you want to parent? Sharing your life with a man who doesn\u2019t even think he should feed you and his unborn child?", "Oh Honey, nta at all! This sounds like a very worrying situation for you, your boundaries and wellbeing are not being considered at all by your boyfriend or his family. And it does not sound like it will be getting better at all. What will happen when the baby is there? Will they continue to walk all over you and your boundaries? Can you pull the plug on the relationship and get out and maybe stay with family that will actually take care of you?", "NTA and I\u2019d think long and hard about what your plans are. It\u2019s going to be a nightmare dealing with an infant and those people.", "NTA!\nLet me tell you! Those dishes would of stayed in the sink till I die!! \nYour BF is a jerk!

Your boyfriend needs to be on your side and help you set boundaries with his family. He needs to recognize he has started a new family with you and that you and his child need to be the priority.

That sucks.", "The only red flags here are your boyfriend and his family. You are growing a literal human inside of you, of course you're tired! On top of that, you're working and still maintaining 50% of the housework. You are pulling more than your fair share of weight right now and your boyfriend needs to get his shit together. Not to mention, but who the fuck cooks food for other people and then tells the one person that wasn't cooked for that they are responsible for cleaning up the dishes and resulting mess? Those are some Olympic level mind games to be playing on a pregnant woman, and you do not deserve this treatment. You should be getting support from your partner and his family, not more drama and work. \nYou need to think very carefully, OP. Pregnancy has a way of bringing forth any unhealthy behavior patterns within a relationship and you are getting a very clear view of what the rest of your life will be like with your partner and his family if something big doesn't change. Things won't suddenly get better just because baby came. If anything, that will be the next big catalyst for more issues to arise. This is extremely common.  I don't know if you are in therapy already, but it may be something to look into if not. Having another person in your village to help support you while you are going through these next phases of life can really make a world of difference.", "Nta\n\nEspecially after they expected you to wash the dishes for food that wasn't even made for you.

Why should you clean up dishes from a meal you didn't get to enjoy after being at work all day.  You already said you didn't want guest that evening and here they are making a mess for you to clean up while you are starving with a lil person inside you that needs to eat too.

You need to have a conversation with your boyfriend that when his family visits it's his responsibility to clean up afterwards.

While she can\u2019t even stand straight. Because it sounds like he will and this needs to be addressed NOW.

That is not my chore.\n\nAlso, as long as MIL and SIL continue to disrespect me, they should not expect to know our children well.

I\u2019d be incandescent with rage, and if you weren\u2019t so godawful tired and without support, you would be too. Have a come to Jesus talk with him, and if he doesn\u2019t shape up in the next few months, don\u2019t let sunk cost fallacies keep you in tjis relationship. You deserve a partner you can depend on, not someone who sees you as a bangmaid.", "NTA\n\nBF needs a wake up call- you are growing a human in your body. He also left their celebration mess for you to clean up and didn't even have the courtesy to leave you food. Furthermore, you told your SIL it was a bad time and she ignored you anyway before leaving extra work for you to do. That's just plain rude, BF's family or not. And it is perfectly reasonable to need to ask other residents if company is ok.... BF is free to see his family whenever, but not free to inconvenience you.\n\nHe'd better shape up, tbh, and stop taking you and your role in this pregnancy for granted because his family is going to find out how much less visitation they'll have when you split up if he doesn't. \n\nHonestly, if he's going to ignore you in favor of his mom, red flag.

He\u2019s already not being respectful of your need for personal space from his family, so once the baby comes, he will continue to disregard your need for space from them.

You can still be loving and say no. \n\nYou are going through significant body changes that effect you physically, emotionally and mentally and you need to be able to feel comfortable in your own home. I suggest keep your support network close, whether that\u2019s family or friends of yours. You need all the support you need. \n\nI used to work in perinatal mental health and I saw this problem ALL THE TIME. So so so unfair for them to say you aren\u2019t excited about the pregnancy. A lot of the time pregnancy is romanticised way too much which is so toxic. At the end of the day this pregnancy experience is uniquely yours, no one else\u2019s! No one should be telling you how you should feel. A lot of the mothers I would work with had so many feelings of guilt that they weren\u2019t feeling connected to the pregnancy because their family had put these expectations on them. \n\nI really hope you can sort this out, however, you need to put yourself first. Once this baby comes you want to be surrounded by people who will listen to how you are feeling and respect the choices you make for you and your baby. You do not want this kind of energy around.", "Nta\n\nMy petty self would have rounded up the dishes, taken them to MIL/SIL house and left them in the doorstop. \n\nYou aren\u2019t Their slave.\n\nIt\u2019s only \u201cyour chore\u201d if you partake (even then your partner should be picking up more of the tasks) .You didn\u2019t get to eat anything, your \u201cpartner\u201d (\u201c \u201cbc he\u2019s not a real one. Just a walking red flag) should have done the dishes for what he got to eat. \n\nHe is trying to guilt you and manipulate you\n \nYea nah. Start an emergency secret fund. Sweetie you\u2019re gonna need it if you stick around.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want to have children with someone who is still tethered to his mommy\u2019s apron strings.", "i hope you read all these comments!! this is fucked up. sometimes the posts on this sub are so fucking depressing, too many ppl so warped by their shitty partners that they have no idea how much theyre being taken advantage of. the fact that youre posting on here thinking you mightve done something wrong..."]}
