For you to have to wait 20 minutes is ridiculous, rude, and unacceptable.", "NTA.  You\u2019re doing her a favor and she was beyond rude and entitled.", "NTA. You were doing her a favor and she was taking advantage of you. I wouldn't risk my job for a random coworker either.

And you waited plenty long enough. No reason for you two to both be late because she can't manage her time.", "NTA\n\nThe co-worker doesn't respect you.

If you wait for more you might be late with her.", "NTA.\n\nIf she can't be bothered to show up on-time she doesn't deserve the ride.  No sense making yourself late for her.", "NTA. commitments are commitments.", "NTA. Have had a similar problem with one of my friends. Same job, gets up at the same time (we used to text each other in the morning) but somehow always needed an extra 15 minutes to \"get his shoes\". Made us both late a couple of times and we're on our last warning. Work starts at 9am and the drive is 40 mins. Didn't wait for him the next time he didn't pick up my 10 calls (it was 8:15 at this point) and had the audacity to call me at 8:50 and call me an AH for not waiting (I was 5 minutes away from work)", "NTA I had a similar situation and also finally just left. She was furious when she finally got to work. And I did feel a little bit bad about it, but she wasn't answering her phone even though I could see her light was on and I could see her shadow walking around so she was up  Two, I was doing  her a favor by going out of my way to pick her up and bring her home. And three, she got to where she was expecting even if her shift was different than mine that I should be picking her up and bringing her home. I even made a point later that day to ask her if she needed a ride home, and she was quite rude in her refusal.  She didn't ask me again after that.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing you could have done differently was text \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for 20 minutes. I\u2019m leaving in one minute whether or not you\u2019re in the car\u201d before leaving. But not having done so doesn\u2019t make you an AH.\n\nIf she asks for a ride again, tell her you need a) an apology for the wasted time and the times she made you late and b) a commitment to coming to the car when you arrive before you\u2019ll consider it.", "NTA.  Her inability to be ready on time is not a valid reason to cause you to be late.  She can sort out her own transportation.", "NTA and I will never understand why people who should be grateful for a favor instead act rude and entitled. No more rides for her.", "Nope NTA!\n\nIf someone is giving you a ride to work, if you are  not ready and waiting for them, before they come, you are late.\n\nIf this was the first time she did this, maybe, but she has been making it a habit.

When you're relying on other people to get to work, making them wait 20 minutes for you because you decided to not be punctual and be ready on time, seems like a really shitty move. Very inconsiderate on their part. Never give that person rides again.", "NTA, she\u2019s not respecting you or your time. You shouldn\u2019t be late because of her. I had the same with a coworker. I was leaving a voicemail while pulling away. He came running out with shoes in hand. Never made me wait again.", "NTA, you had to leave of face the consequences of being late to work.  She is not worth risking getting written up.  You waited for 20 minutes.  She needs to find her own way to work.", "She probably would've blamed her being late on OP. People like this have no shame.\n\nI am so mad for OP that they were treated like this, but SO proud that they stood up for themselves and said \"no more.\" We hear so many stories here where people roll over, let others walk all over them, and give themselves completely up to the assholes in their lives, and then ask if they're the asshole for daring to ask for just a little bit for themselves. \n\nNot OP! Stand firm, OP; you're NTA!", "I would say 5 minutes is enough. 20 minutes is way beyond when OP barely made it to work in time. An extra red light could have made him late.

You waited longer than you should have.  Her making you wait 20 minutes is outrageous.  You've made the right decision to let her get to work on her own.", "NTA. You were doing your friend a favor, and she was unconscionably thoughtless and entitled.\n\nYears ago I had a friend whom I was meeting for dinner. She finally showed up an hour late. Her excuse? She stopped to shop for cosmetics.

You were doing her a *favour*, you are not her chauffeur and she needs to respect your time.", "NTA. I live with someone who is exactly like this and I have left him many times. 15 minutes is my wait time. And he knows this and accepts his fate.  Side Note: My boss makes anyone who is late apologize by saying, \"I am sorry I don't respect you or your time enough to have been here when the meeting started\" and that has really helped our team be on time.", "She ditched you.

That's just nonsense. And then she came downstairs thinking you would still be there? What fantasy world is she living in?\n\nOP, NTA and don't ever give her a ride again even if she's standing there waiting to go.", "NTA. Two minutes max I\u2019d be waiting. More often than not, be ready before I arrive.", "Nta", "NTA - I was young and working on a painting crew before I ran my own, used to have to pick the other guys up because no one had a Lisence, hated it, bunch of drunks with DUIs. Now winter in Canada is a solid -35 sometimes so I\u2019ve already had to get out and warm the car up, and then wait for buddy for 20 minutes and sometimes he just wouldn\u2019t respond. So one day I just left, told my boss I wasn\u2019t driving anyone anymore, then a couple days later I got my walking papers, so I started my own outfit, fuck him.

She can arrange her own way there and take as many hours as she likes to get ready.\n\nDon't you give in, either", "NTA, OP is being nice by offering a ride to and from work. Co-worker needs to be ready at the pickup time except for an emergency in which she needs to let OP know and OP goes to work directly. This isn't a ride share service.", "You waited for 20 minutes?? You're a saint. You are doing her a favour. If she doesn't show up on time you have every right to just drive off. NTA", "NTA. You're doing her a favor and she can't be ready on time. My car was broken down for 6 wks and I relied on others for rides; I tried to be ready and downstairs when they arrived.

Not your responsibility. It's a nice thing to do - to offer someone a ride, but they need to be responsible and respectful. \n\n\nI don't have a car at the moment, and I can deal with it for 90% of what I need. For the few instances where I'll ask someone for a ride, you can be sure that I am waiting downstairs a few minutes before our scheduled time, I offer gas money, and I'll occasionally make some brownies as a thank you.", "Exactly how is her taking too long to get ready on time to catch up to you your fault though?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI have a brother that needs trips to visit family members and doesn't drive and pulls this same shit.\n\nYou arrange a time and he will show up 15-30 minutes later with some excuse.\n\nIt's annoying.", "nta", "NTA.
