With respect to YOUR time.\n\nWhat was she expecting? That you're late too and get in trouble with her?", "NTA. She should be ready and waiting for you when you arrive. For you to have to wait 20 minutes is ridiculous, rude, and unacceptable.", "NTA.  You\u2019re doing her a favor and she was beyond rude and entitled.", "NTA. You were doing her a favor and she was taking advantage of you. I wouldn't risk my job for a random coworker either. She can figure out another way to get to work.", "Sorry, the rule of passengers in need of a lift is that they are ready and out the door before the driver doing them a favor arrives.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nYou were doing *her* a favour. And you waited plenty long enough. No reason for you two to both be late because she can't manage her time.", "NTA\n\nThe co-worker doesn't respect you. If they did, they would be ready and waiting for you before you arrive. Basic respect is basic respect.", "I\u2019m happy you told her to not bother meeting you after work.

If you wait for more you might be late with her.", "NTA.\n\nIf she can't be bothered to show up on-time she doesn't deserve the ride.  No sense making yourself late for her.", "NTA. commitments are commitments.", "NTA. Have had a similar problem with one of my friends. Same job, gets up at the same time (we used to text each other in the morning) but somehow always needed an extra 15 minutes to \"get his shoes\". Made us both late a couple of times and we're on our last warning. Work starts at 9am and the drive is 40 mins. Didn't wait for him the next time he didn't pick up my 10 calls (it was 8:15 at this point) and had the audacity to call me at 8:50 and call me an AH for not waiting (I was 5 minutes away from work)", "NTA I had a similar situation and also finally just left. She was furious when she finally got to work. And I did feel a little bit bad about it, but she wasn't answering her phone even though I could see her light was on and I could see her shadow walking around so she was up  Two, I was doing  her a favor by going out of my way to pick her up and bring her home. And three, she got to where she was expecting even if her shift was different than mine that I should be picking her up and bringing her home. I even made a point later that day to ask her if she needed a ride home, and she was quite rude in her refusal.  She didn't ask me again after that.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing you could have done differently was text \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for 20 minutes. I\u2019m leaving in one minute whether or not you\u2019re in the car\u201d before leaving. But not having done so doesn\u2019t make you an AH.\n\nIf she asks for a ride again, tell her you need a) an apology for the wasted time and the times she made you late and b) a commitment to coming to the car when you arrive before you\u2019ll consider it.", "NTA.  Her inability to be ready on time is not a valid reason to cause you to be late.  She can sort out her own transportation.", "NTA and I will never understand why people who should be grateful for a favor instead act rude and entitled. No more rides for her.", "Nope NTA!\n\nIf someone is giving you a ride to work, if you are  not ready and waiting for them, before they come, you are late.\n\nIf this was the first time she did this, maybe, but she has been making it a habit. That she lost her ride to work, is totally on her.", "NTA, obviously. She took advantage of you and you refused to let her keep doing it. Kudos.", "I mean, technically the cut-off is a lil harsh maybe, but if you would've been late because she was being late... I'd say NTA", "INFO: does this person have their own vehicle?", "Was she expecting you to arrive at the time that you did, or did you arrive early and catch her off guard?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People like this have no shame.\n\nI am so mad for OP that they were treated like this, but SO proud that they stood up for themselves and said \"no more.\" We hear so many stories here where people roll over, let others walk all over them, and give themselves completely up to the assholes in their lives, and then ask if they're the asshole for daring to ask for just a little bit for themselves. \n\nNot OP!
