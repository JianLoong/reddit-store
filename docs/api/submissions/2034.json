You definitely need to gain a better understanding of child development if you have any hope at curtailing the negative behaviors your daughter exhibits and help guide her into being a decent human being as she ages.

I can't imagine doing this to my kids.", "YTA ma'am she's 4 that's what she's supposed to do if you don't like being a parent just say that. because nothing you just said makes sense she's a toddler genius", "She is only 4. Her actions and behaviors are because of how she has been raised/treated for the last 4 years. You aren\u2019t going to undo that by not giving her any Christmas presents. \n\nKids need structure and boundaries. While you say you are a first time parent, isn\u2019t everyone with a child a first time parent at some point? That is no excuse, there are endless resources out there. Books, podcasts, classes, documentaries etc. even your pediatrician could answer questions and point you in the right direction for resources. Do not wait to do this.

The answer is no but if you keep doing the same things you are going to get the same results.\n\nYou set the standard of what you accept and what you don't. No means no. She keeps getting out of her bed? You put her back. BUT do not engage. \n\nOne example is my daughter went through a stage of not wanting to wear clothes when leaving the house. I needed to go up the street and she want to come. I told her \"you have two choices: you put clothes on and you can come with mummy or you don't and you stay home with daddy\".\n\nShe did not want too so I told her ok, I will see you in a bit and I started to walk out the door. Guess how quick she wanted to put her clothes on then? \n\nBe consistent and follow through. Remind your daughter of her choices. Don't engage when she is carrying on.\n\nShe has acted this way because it has worked for her. From this moment on, it no longer does because you are taking the control back.

You either need to teach her how to behave or seek a professional child counselor who could offer advice or help out. If you don't try and change your teachings as a parent, your child won't do the same with her behaviour.", "YTA this is why you set rules and boundaries let me deal with each part individually.\n\n1) Not sure about the Grandma one, depending on distance she could sleep over at her grandmas once a week or Grandma could call before bed as a reward for good behaviour.\n\n2)Maybe she cries because she has a sensitive scalp and it hurts to have her combed. You should ask her.\n\n3)Bedtime routine is important maybe she doesn't want to sleep in her own room because she is afraid of the dark or the monster under her bed. Now I think Co-sleeping depends on whether that works for you. If you put her to bed in her room and she ends up in your room put her back. \n\n4) The tablet and phone time should not be indefinite so give her a time limit and stick to it. Warn her when time is almost up since she doesn't understand the concept of time yet and children get upset with sudden change. Set the timer where she can see it.\n\n5) if she breaks something on purpose there needs to be consequences if it's not an accident like if it's a toy then she loses the use of the toy. You need to show her that breaking things means they can't always be fixed.\n\nThe consequences should mirror the action as much as it can. \n\nChildren need rules and boundaries to feel safe. \n\nChildren don't want to act out, they only want to be understood and don't have the vocabulary to tell you. You need to show her that you are a safe space where she can express how she feels.\n\nChristmas is a grey area because even though we tell children that if they are naughty Santa will give them coal.

Does she throw a tantrum when she doesn't get her way in class? Ask them what they do when bad behaviour occurs. I recently read that ignoring a tantrum could cause emotional issues. Try to find out what helps to shorten the tantrum, it could be leaving her alone, holding her, or just letting her know you're there for her when she needs you. Validate her feelings as to why she has a tantrum, is she upset, angry, sad and why does she feel that way, when the tantrum is over obviously. Even young kids want to be heard, want to be taken seriously. Kids don't want to behave badly, l bet she wants to be a good little girl but doesn't know how. Compliment good behaviour, discipline bad behaviour. The punishment needs to fit the crime of course, like taking away the tablet for the morning/afternoon, no sweets today. You can't punish a child for something that happend yesterday, if she behaves badly now she needs the be disciplind now, after a warning of course. Doesn't matter if you're outside of your home, there is almost always a way to discipline immediatly.", "Giving her positive attention is a great start. Make sure that you are keeping her engaged with you on an outing or playing a game regularly. It\u2019s really easy to get into a negative dynamic when kids misbehave often and become very reactive. I would try talking to her and explaining what behaviour you expect and what the consequences will be. Just start on one thing. If you try to tackle everything at once it will be too much for you all. You need to decide what that thing will be. Then tell her when I ask you to do something e.g don\u2019t kick us which should be an absolute no no then she needs to go to her bed. One of you will probably have to stay with her. But explain it to her. We don\u2019t like it when you kick us, it hurts and it isn\u2019t kind. If you do that then you will have to go to your room. Then stick to it. This may not be the best example because it seems as though her bedroom is a problem. You might want to start with her hair, be positive, let\u2019s get your hair brushed, make sure it doesn\u2019t hurt and then we can do x,y,z. \n\nIs her sleep ok? You mention she won\u2019t sleep in her bed and wants to sleep with grandma and it sounds as though she sleeps with you. This could be a tired kid. \n\nIt is probably worthwhile talking to a paediatrician or some kind of parenting help that is available to help you set what you what your family to look like.", "Ahaparenting.com will be helpful. I wish I had found it before my kids were in middle school, but it even helped from them on.", "Consequences.\nStart a chart to track her behavior and set short term goals such as a treat or activity at the end of the week. Things like holiday gifts are a bit more of a long term goal you can introduce next year.\n\nMake sure the goal is something the child actually wants, not what you think the child should want.\n\nUse markers or stickers and explain which behavior gets positive marks and which behavior gets marks taken away. \n\nGo over results daily - but not immediately after a tantrum. The child needs to be receptive and listen to you.\n\nBe consistent and don\u2019t let your temper or frustration get the better of you. This will take time and you will probably have many setbacks until she understands this is not going to change.", "The other thing is sometimes they just need a time out/quiet time if you\u2019ve exhausted your other options. If they\u2019re overstimulated and exhausted and starting to get whiny/frustrated they aren\u2019t getting what they want. Just *calmly* be like okay sounds like you\u2019re getting worked up why don\u2019t you go take some quiet time in your room and I\u2019ll come check on you in a few minutes. Lights off door closed. Just let them be.", "read about proactive approaches to childhood behavioural management. \n\nits a way to condition your kid to be good without yelling, or tantrums or exhaustion. I promise you it'll be worth it.", "Please google 'positive parenting solutions'.  It's an online set of classes. It saved my sanity. \n\nMy daughter's behavior was similar. (She was later diagnosed with ADHD). \n\nAnd I didn't have the parenting skills. I didn't have the patience. And I think my daughter was feeding off my negative energy. We were in a constant negative cycle of bad behavior/negative reinforcement/resentment/exhaustion. It sounds like you are there too right now. I had so much love for her, but it wasn't enough. I needed TOOLS. Please do look that online course up. I think it will help.", "This right here! Also- don't try to reason or negotiate with her in the heat of a tantrum.", "You are doing poor parenting though. You have allowed her to act that way and haven't put a stop to it. You need the tools in place to be a good parent, not everyone automatically has them. Look online, seek advice from professionals. She is only four, you can turn it around. However you can not blame her or punish her, she can't control her emotions.\nParenting is very hard, everyone makes mistakes.", "The way your child is acting while normal for young kids, you should have more control. That\u2019s because you haven\u2019t been putting in the effort and commitment to actually *parenting*. And now you wanna cancel christmas because you haven\u2019t disciplined your child correctly.", "You need to attain better parenting skills to raise your child in a healthy way. Believe it or not, parenting well is not natural born skill. It is largely a reflection of how you were raised. No shame in trying to better the experience for your kid. It will actually make you happier too in the long run.\n\nTake some parenting classes and stop blaming your 4yo", "\u201cI\u2019ve never been a parent before, but despite seeing evidence of a child struggling with behaviour, I blame it on the child and not on my ability to parent.\u201d.\nNote AITA isn\u2019t a place to get advice", "This isn\u2019t the place for advice. In fact, it\u2019s against the subreddit rules", "It is bad parenting, whether you have experience or not. You don't know how to parent, take a class.", "I don't have to have robbed a bank before to know you should wear a mask and have a getaway car waiting.", "Lack of knowledge or experience doesn't exempt you from being a poor parent.  I get it's your first and there is no guidebook on parenting since every child is different.  Become better and more knowledgeable on what to do instead of throwing your hands up and saying I can't do anything.  Set boundaries, she will push back on them because she is testing how far she can go.  Stand firm, don't let her walk all over you, at the end of the day you are the parent.  It will take time and there will be shouting and tears, but it is for her benefit down the road.  You won't see it now, but she will thank you for being a better and more dedicated parent when she's older.\n\nAlso, buy her something for Christmas, even if it seems like she doesn't deserve it now.", "Watch some supernanny videos. Your daughter's behaviour reminded me of those. I think they will truly help, there's a lot of techniques for different things. Taking Christmas away should NEVER be a punishment.", "Well, you've never had a child before.  . .", "So, let\u2019s recap:\n\nYour preschooler is a she devil that should be able to fully obey with no guidance, to the point you\u2019re taking away CHRISTMAS \n\nBut you, the near middle aged adult woman is in no way shape or form a bad parent, or have anything to do with your child\u2019s behavior, because it\u2019s your first \ntime\n\nWhat the heck are you smoking, lady? You have no blame here but your child is a monster?\n\nGolly gee whiz, wonder why. Giving a kid no boundaries as well as lamenting that it\u2019s not your fault!\n\nGreat parenting", "Try it.  I'm no expert on 4 year old behaviors, as my youngest of 5 kids is now 23. I used TV as a babysitter more than I like to admit and I should have interacted with them more often looking back. \nNow is your chance.  Switch things up.

As others have said, you need parenting classes.", "Yeah, we were shocked at the difference between the amounts of screen time can have on behavior. But cutting back can be a painful process. We're always trying to find that right balance.", "It's ok to feel exhausted by your kids, but don't punish her like this, especially on Christmas. These things stick.", "no i am not dismissing everyone. but i did notice how most of the replies were quite judgemental and immediately saying that OP was the AH. it can be difficult for parents to be honest about how they feel because of the judgement and backlash that comes from opening up. i am speaking from a place of experience and knowledge.", "My parents used to cancel our gifts and give them to our step siblings when we were bad, needless to say my brother and I hate gifts now.", "That\u2019s great advice thank you", "That's awful, and in my opinion a form of emotional abuse.", "Yup, I've had multiple therapists say that if I was a child and telling them the stuff I was going through they would of had me pulled from my home."]}
