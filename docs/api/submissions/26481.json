I understand being private and wanting to be off social media. But what you\u2019re talking about goes way, way beyond that, into the territory of being unwell. Your family doesn\u2019t even know what university you went to? Or where you work? \n\nYou should speak to someone about this. It\u2019s impacting your ability to have a closer relationship with your family and people in general. It\u2019s ok to let people in. And memories are a wonderful thing to have- I hope you find a way to preserve memories that\u2019s also healthy for you.", "NAH\n\nWhat you're describing is WAY beyond just being private. You can have you boundaries ut don't be surprised when others find that weird or inconvenient or just alienating.", "NAH. Your sister, understandably, wants to have photos of family with her son. You don\u2019t have to be in photos if you don\u2019t want to (though I do think you have issues.) \n\nI do find this very strange. There\u2019s private & there\u2019s paranoid. You seem to be veering to \u2018*paranoid*\u2019. Unless you work for the security services, as long as your wishes about keeping family photos private/not posted on social media is respected, it seems wildly irrational to be this obsessed with \u2018privacy\u2019. I\u2019m all for privacy, but this sounds like something is going on.", "It\u2019s strange.. you probably need therapy though", "I think you need to talk to a professional, you\u2019re beyond private to the point that it\u2019s unhealthy it seems.", "NTA at all for not wanting your picture taken. I'll admit I find your compartmentalization of your life pretty extreme, but I wasn't in your shoes. Do you by any chance have some resentment of your sis or other family members for not helping out more with your mom?", "NAH.\n\nOp, have you gone through therapy? I hate armchair diagnosing anyone, but I feel like this goes way beyond being a private person. It looks like you're not letting anyone know the real you, or get too close.", "Nah.  But gotta admit, you\u2019re very strange.  You really should see a therapist about this obsession with privacy.  It\u2019s not healthy.", "I find it hard to judge, but I once was a person who didn\u2019t want their picture taken. I hate seeing my in photos. \n\nOne day I read an article that changed my life. It was by a woman who nearly died. Her family had no photos of her, and she realised that she saw an ugly, unlovable person while they saw the daughter/sibling/friend they adored, who had a lovely smile and lit up the room. \n\nMy MIL has two photos of me in her house, and I hate myself in both of them, but I am proud she likes me enough to want to show me off to the world. (She\u2019s awesome.)\n\nIf you can bear it, let your sister take pictures. It seems to mean a lot to her.", "YTA, you can just ask her not to post them online. But wanting to have pictures of your own family is normal and not allowing anyone to take pictures for over five years is fucking weird. People like to be able to have pictures showing how kids age, and how 'look your auntie/uncle used to hold you/read to you even when you were little' it's not weird. I'm not a huge fan of having my picture taken but I do let it happen at family gatherings and when I'm holding my cousins baby (the closest I'll get in the foreseeable future to having niblings).", "NAH. It's reasonable to not want your picture taken. It's also reasonable to want pictures of your family.  I have a similar aversion to getting my picture taken, but my family is at least nice enough to at least ask me to be included in one picture together and then respects me enough to not take any other random pictures of me throughout the day. It's a very easy way to keep the peace to just allow a single picture every now and then. But every now and then needs to be at a rate your more comfortable with than her. She doesn't need to take a dozen pictures of you every time your over, but if she sees a good chance and is at least willing to ask, \"Hey OP, would you mind if I take this one picture with you and your nephew?\" It wouldn't kill you to acquiesce.", "NAH You get to decide whether or not your photo is taken or not in family situations.  You might want to consider some therapy to see if you aversion to photos has a cause other than just preference.", "YTA - I get being private but you have taken this way too far. You have the right to be a hermit I guess, but your sister is not wrong for wanting to capture memories with you. Have you actually had a conversation with her? Have you told her \u201chey, I\u2019ll take photos but don\u2019t post them\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll post for one a month\u201d or whatever? To me it sounds like you\u2019re just constantly being evasive which is weird, unhelpful, and probably very exhausting. She\u2019s your family, and like it or not there will be personal details shared and photos taken if you\u2019re around them.

Even if you are NTA, I can understand your sister's frustration and her desire to immortalize memories.

There is being private, and then there is whatever you are doing. Your family doesn\u2019t know your job, where you went to college, or even what your major was? What? What do they know?

It doesn\u2019t matter what your reasons are. No photos means just that.", "NAH but you go way beyond private into paranoid. It's one thing to not want copious pictures taken of you.

Serious question are you like an FBI informant in the WPA?", "NTA.  \n\nI read your comments and in one you clarified that your sister is a chronic social media poster, whether people like it or not.

If she can respect that boundary, I don\u2019t see an issue with you being in photos with your nephew. If she breaks that boundary and posts all of her pictures to Facebook regardless of your wishes then double down and refuse to be in any pictures with your nephew.", "Nta, for she gonna put it on social media", "NTA - I don\u2019t like having my photo taken either and I\u2019d be pissed if someone took my photo and put it on social media.  \nTell your sister that the fact that she\u2019s put photos of you on social media tells you she can\u2019t be trusted with taking photos of you", "You should probably keep a couple current pictures of yourself in case you like go missing, but I don\u2019t think your sister needs them.

It's not just a single photo anymore, it's the potential to be posted online, and she has already done this to you.  It makes me sick with anger to think about them trying to sneak and take pics anyway, even when you've told them how you feel.  Why is a facebook post so much more important than them respecting you, or you trusting them?\n\nIgnore these comments from people implying you are weird for being so protective over your privacy, and telling you that you need therapy - how dare they!  It's totally fine to feel this way.", "\"I'm a private person\" yet comes on Reddit to talk about her family. YTA and you need therapy.", "NTA. No one gets a say on whether or not a picture will include you but you. \n\nI seriously doubt that your nephew is going to miss you in photos when he looks back at his baby pictures. You could always take photos with him on your phone, so that your sister can't post them.", "YTA and you need to understand that what you're doing will be extremely alienating to anyone you want to have in your life.\n\nDisallowing pictures by anyone for any reason is gonna make people feel weird. Refusing to tell your own family what you do for a living will damage your relationships by making them feel like you hold them at arm's length. \n\nThis goes beyond being private. It's how someone would act if they were on the run. Is everything okay? Do you even want to have close friendships, meaningful connection with family, or a romantic partner?", "Yta - this goes beyond being a private person and I think you actually need to talk to someone and get some help.
