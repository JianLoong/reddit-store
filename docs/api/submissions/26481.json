It\u2019s impacting your ability to have a closer relationship with your family and people in general. It\u2019s ok to let people in. And memories are a wonderful thing to have- I hope you find a way to preserve memories that\u2019s also healthy for you.", "NAH\n\nWhat you're describing is WAY beyond just being private. You can have you boundaries ut don't be surprised when others find that weird or inconvenient or just alienating.", "NAH. Your sister, understandably, wants to have photos of family with her son. You don\u2019t have to be in photos if you don\u2019t want to (though I do think you have issues.) \n\nI do find this very strange. There\u2019s private & there\u2019s paranoid. You seem to be veering to \u2018*paranoid*\u2019. Unless you work for the security services, as long as your wishes about keeping family photos private/not posted on social media is respected, it seems wildly irrational to be this obsessed with \u2018privacy\u2019. I\u2019m all for privacy, but this sounds like something is going on.", "It\u2019s strange.. you probably need therapy though", "I think you need to talk to a professional, you\u2019re beyond private to the point that it\u2019s unhealthy it seems.", "NTA at all for not wanting your picture taken. I'll admit I find your compartmentalization of your life pretty extreme, but I wasn't in your shoes. Do you by any chance have some resentment of your sis or other family members for not helping out more with your mom?", "NAH.\n\nOp, have you gone through therapy? I hate armchair diagnosing anyone, but I feel like this goes way beyond being a private person. It looks like you're not letting anyone know the real you, or get too close.", "Nah.

It\u2019s not healthy.", "I find it hard to judge, but I once was a person who didn\u2019t want their picture taken. I hate seeing my in photos. \n\nOne day I read an article that changed my life. It was by a woman who nearly died. Her family had no photos of her, and she realised that she saw an ugly, unlovable person while they saw the daughter/sibling/friend they adored, who had a lovely smile and lit up the room. \n\nMy MIL has two photos of me in her house, and I hate myself in both of them, but I am proud she likes me enough to want to show me off to the world. (She\u2019s awesome.)\n\nIf you can bear it, let your sister take pictures. It seems to mean a lot to her.", "YTA, you can just ask her not to post them online. But wanting to have pictures of your own family is normal and not allowing anyone to take pictures for over five years is fucking weird. People like to be able to have pictures showing how kids age, and how 'look your auntie/uncle used to hold you/read to you even when you were little' it's not weird. I'm not a huge fan of having my picture taken but I do let it happen at family gatherings and when I'm holding my cousins baby (the closest I'll get in the foreseeable future to having niblings).", "NAH. It's reasonable to not want your picture taken. It's also reasonable to want pictures of your family.  I have a similar aversion to getting my picture taken, but my family is at least nice enough to at least ask me to be included in one picture together and then respects me enough to not take any other random pictures of me throughout the day. It's a very easy way to keep the peace to just allow a single picture every now and then. But every now and then needs to be at a rate your more comfortable with than her. She doesn't need to take a dozen pictures of you every time your over, but if she sees a good chance and is at least willing to ask, \"Hey OP, would you mind if I take this one picture with you and your nephew?\" It wouldn't kill you to acquiesce.", "NAH You get to decide whether or not your photo is taken or not in family situations.

To me it sounds like you\u2019re just constantly being evasive which is weird, unhelpful, and probably very exhausting. She\u2019s your family, and like it or not there will be personal details shared and photos taken if you\u2019re around them.

If she can respect that boundary, I don\u2019t see an issue with you being in photos with your nephew. If she breaks that boundary and posts all of her pictures to Facebook regardless of your wishes then double down and refuse to be in any pictures with your nephew.", "Nta, for she gonna put it on social media", "NTA - I don\u2019t like having my photo taken either and I\u2019d be pissed if someone took my photo and put it on social media.  \nTell your sister that the fact that she\u2019s put photos of you on social media tells you she can\u2019t be trusted with taking photos of you", "You should probably keep a couple current pictures of yourself in case you like go missing, but I don\u2019t think your sister needs them.

It's not just a single photo anymore, it's the potential to be posted online, and she has already done this to you.  It makes me sick with anger to think about them trying to sneak and take pics anyway, even when you've told them how you feel.  Why is a facebook post so much more important than them respecting you, or you trusting them?\n\nIgnore these comments from people implying you are weird for being so protective over your privacy, and telling you that you need therapy - how dare they!  It's totally fine to feel this way.", "\"I'm a private person\" yet comes on Reddit to talk about her family. YTA and you need therapy.", "NTA. No one gets a say on whether or not a picture will include you but you. \n\nI seriously doubt that your nephew is going to miss you in photos when he looks back at his baby pictures. You could always take photos with him on your phone, so that your sister can't post them.", "YTA and you need to understand that what you're doing will be extremely alienating to anyone you want to have in your life.\n\nDisallowing pictures by anyone for any reason is gonna make people feel weird. Refusing to tell your own family what you do for a living will damage your relationships by making them feel like you hold them at arm's length. \n\nThis goes beyond being private. It's how someone would act if they were on the run. Is everything okay? Do you even want to have close friendships, meaningful connection with family, or a romantic partner?", "Yta - this goes beyond being a private person and I think you actually need to talk to someone and get some help.

Your sister has reason for wanting pictures to remember you by and for her son.\n\nConsider a compromise where you will allow maybe an annual picture of you with him where you can be prepared and look your best and stipulate that these pictures are for her and her son only and are never to be posted anywhere online.\n\nIf even that isn't something you can live with, still NTA and your sister should respect your wishes but do consider it.", "Yeeeeeeeaaaaaah OP takes privacy to a very weird length. Your family doesn't know where you went to college or what you do for work? That's....something that requires therapy unless they're actively dangerous people.", "Agree. I thought my husband was very private, but I couldn't imagine this level of boundary.", "Yeah, I feel like a normal boundary would be to say, \"Please don't post any pictures of me on social media. You can take our picture together but it's only to be shared with family and never online.\" That would be reasonable. This...is over the top unless OP is in the witness protection program or something. Her family...doesn't know where she went to school or what she does for work? Is she a spy? Actually this would make more sense if she was in the CIA or something.", "I don't know. I sort of do the same thing.\n\nFor me, coming from a family with a narcissistic mom and an alcoholic dad, separating different aspects of my life and hiding just comes naturally.\n\nI'd rather lie than explain certain things about my life.\n\nI understand that others find it weird or inconvenient or alienating. But that's not really of concern to me. As I suspect it doesn't with OP.\n\nI do have certain close people who know more than my family or friends do. But even then, they don't know everything.\n\nFor example, no one in my personal life knows that I've gotten a pay hike every year since I started working and I'm now earning more than double what I started with 7 years ago. Everyone just assumes I'm still stuck as a lowly college graduate.", "I'm an internet detective. OP is incredibly sensible. I can tell you most people's mother's maiden names within a few min even if you can only see a few profile pics and who liked them on FB. If you've ever posted a pic in your back garden, in front of your house, or out of your window, I can tell where you live. I do it to debunk fake IDs. People have no idea how much info they leak, let alone what their relatives leak for them. That's two pics out there now probably captioned with OP's name and relationship to the kid, posted by someone whose pic is liked by people with two clusters of surnames, OP's sister's, and OP's sister's maiden name. So now you can work out OP's full name. I have found really quite famous people's personal FB by pure accident because their idiot aunt tagged them in a photo.", "I agree, I think OP left a few things out on purpose, maybe for her own safety. She could be in witness protection and is fearful of someone from her past finding out about her.", "You mean NTA. Some people don\u2019t like their photos being taken and that\u2019s their right. Just because you find it weird doesn\u2019t mean you can force someone to do something they don\u2019t want to.", ">You seem to be veering to \u2018paranoid\u2019\n\nOP made that turn a while ago and kept on going.", "Yeah. The only people I have ever met that were that bad about pictures were dudes in their 40s with professional or government jobs where they didn't want any pictures of them at their nerdy hobby (LARP or live action roleplay) because they were afraid it would get back to an employer and look immature and hurt their career.", "I wonder if a compromise would be for OP to take selfies with her nephew. That way OP has full control and doesn't have to share them, but does have something to show the nephew when he's older if they want.", "There are other very good reasons not to want your picture online and we can start with all the data harvesting and AI deep fake porn being made. People can't be trusted not to put your picture online or store it in the cloud somewhere. And once it is there it's over, other have access to it too.\n\nI don't think you all realize how many creepy people have pictures of you or how many predatory companies (which is all of them) are exploiting your images.", "This is where I\u2019m leaning as well. How can you develop and cultivate any kind of relationship with people when you\u2019re this closed off? I noticed OP said she hasn\u2019t taken a picture in 5 years\u2026 so when she was 18\u2026 the same age as when her mother passed. I wonder if OP was this private before or if this began after the mother\u2019s passing?", "I know someone who hates to have her pic taken. She will turn away or try to step back, or even put her hand up to block. This is a self esteem thing, not secret government job issue. Several years back a close relative passed away, and while looking at the pics on the memories table at the funeral she got mad when she realized no pics of her with the deceased were included. She thought at first she was being excluded for some reason, not realizing at the time it was all her own fault. Some day we will all be gone, and our loved ones will want to remember us. I hope OP can move past this issue for that reason.", "Right? It doesn't sound like he went NC with his sister. How does he not share where he's in school or what degree he's getting? Like, when she asked, did he just refuse to answer? It would have been at least a few years.", "OP you\u2019ve made it so that no one knows you. That\u2019s tragic.", "I relate to this so hard. I never posed for photos because I hated how I looked. \n\nWhen my cousin died, I was at his funeral looking at all the pictures of him with friends and family. I realized, if I died at that moment, my family would have no pictures of me. \n\nI started letting people take my picture after that.", "This. I hated taking picture but my late sister do. Till to this day I regretted not having more pic together and i changed my mind.", "Dang that was my first thought with very specific info too. Also \n\n> I explained my extenuating circumstances to my five choices of universities and all five accepted me.\n\nI\u2019m not anywhere near as private as OP and I wouldn\u2019t have had the guts to share my personal experience to 5 academics when I was still a teenager. That ain\u2019t private!", "Hahah that's a great question. So much for private", "Or worse, an unwanted felon.", "If only for the nephews sake as he gets older to know that his aunt was in his life.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s weird or normal. You have the right to not do anything you don\u2019t want to.\n\nDrinking alcohol is normal. Does that make someone an asshole for being sober?", "Exactly! If OP is so paranoid than why tell strangers their business all over Reddit?!?", "OP is mentally unwell if they won\u2019t even tell their sibling what their degree is in. They either need to seek mental help or grow up. Why go around your sister if you hate them knowing anything about you. The sister is very kind to keep maintaining this relationship", "> Serious question are you like an FBI informant in the WPA?\n\nOP is British,  living in the U.K.  I am fairly certain the FBI have no role in policing within the U.K.  Mind you, China set up police stations around the world, including the U.K; perhaps the FBI have also got illegal FBI stations in the U.K.  \n\nOh yes, those illegal police stations have not gone away, despite China having been told to remove them.", "It's not self-centered to not want a photo of yourself immortalized; the sister and nephew have no right to any photos.", "Okay, thank you. I thought I was missing something insanely obvious about why she is so private. The backstory made no sense.", "Well she has to tell the people first she doesn\u2019t want to be in the pictures\u2026.", "??? Lol.", "no doubt", "It makes you sick with anger?", "How could sister have respected that op did not want her picture taken if op never told her? Sister figured it out for herself after a while. Don\u2019t complain that others try to take a picture of you never tell them that you don\u2019t want to be in pictures.", "Except she didn\u2019t. She wrote her sister figured it out eventually  She never said something like \u201e I saw you trying to take a picture of me and nephew. Please don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t want to be photographed.\u201c  you can not complain that someone is not respecting your boundary if you never tell them it\u2019s a boundary.", "I'm older and veeery happy to have no photos of me existing.\n\nJust because you know a few people who changed their minds doesn't mean op will.", "My favorite go to is the weather.  Followed by traffic.", "The nephew has absolutely zero right to any photos of the OP.", "Op doesn't seem to have a son.  The child in question is her nephew.   And op's sister seems to have taken tons of pictures to show him what he looked like as a baby", "Yeah, the only people I know that can\u2019t say exactly what they do for work are decently high up in government or military. I understand being private, but that\u2019s a bit extreme, even if OP was a high clearance gov employee", "yea it is a bit extreme", ">  \"Please don't post any pictures of me on social media. You can take our picture together but it's only to be shared with family and never online.\" \n\nAnd how do we know OP hasn't asked that and her sister still tries to take her photo and post it online.", "I will say as the partner of someone who does this- it can be a little... difficult? I'll try to explain my side\n\nI met my partner 10 years ago in college and developed this giant af crush on him. Unfortunately he was dating someone else at the time but only like 3 people knew. So everyone, including him, is watching me make a fool of myself (to his credit he said \"he wasn't ready for a relationship\") until one of the 3 took pity on me and took me aside and said hey, he's in a LDR. Whoops let me respectfully back the fuck off and try to erase the last 4 months of my life. \n\nAnd then when he and I started dating 3 years after that- he didn't really tell anyone, not even the Family members he has a good relationship we were dating until 2 years in. I remember us going to a party and introducing myself to the people there and them being shocked we had been dating for 2+ years. \n\nAnd I get its nbd for him and it's 100% his privacy and yes it can be odd and inconvenient sometimes but alienating is where I draw the line. There are some experiences he will not share and thats OK but I better freaking know the important crap like who I should not talk to/allergies/etc. It's respecting the relationship and trust that has been built and withholding important information would feel like a violation of that trust.", "Yeah but your reason is your dysfunctional parents, that makes sense. OP doesn't mention any issues with her parents, I mean unfortunately her mum is deceased. They are extremely different circumstances causing the same behaviour. You might understand someone being like that because you are but the reasons are totally different which changes everything.", "Im a professional genealogist and I have found identities of living descendants of deceased individuals using just a single Facebook like on a photo. It\u2019s so easy in the U.S to find people. However, I know England and Europe have a lot more privacy laws.", "But is the small risk of someone finding something about you worth never taking a photo of yourself or family? Like if OP gets married will she ban everyone from taking photos? Don't get me wrong, I avoid posting photos on the internet but this seems extreme.", "OP\u2019s looking at paranoid in the rear view", "There\u2019s a big difference between not having social media or uploading to the cloud and family not knowing a single thing about OP since they were 18.", "Okay thats definitely true but op could maybe have some Polaroids with the nephew that she keeps at her place to show him in the future. They don't have to be digital photos in her sister's possession", "Frankly, it\u2019s sounds like a coping mechanism due to the passing of their mother. If OP never gets close to anyone again, they can\u2019t be hurt again. \n\nSeek help OP!", "Exactly. And with no one knowing her, that also means no one can support her when she needs it (as she clearly does). It doesn't sound like she let anyone support her when she was going through her mother's death, which her sister also had to go through. It's a very lonely life.\n\nI get not wanting pictures on social media because of privacy and other reasons. My brother doesn't want me posting photos of his kids on social media that he's not on, and I respect that. But not wanting pictures at all, even for yourself to look back on, makes me sad. Whenever I see my family (we live in different countries), we take a lot of pictures because we never know if something could happen, and it could be the last time. I'm SO glad I did that with my grandmothers especially. I know not everyone is like that, but it's something to think about. Maybe OP just isn't sentimental, but it sounds like she doesn't have a bad relationship with her sister now. But it must be really hard for her sister, especially if it's just the two of them, because there's always going to be that detachment. It's just sad to be so isolated when there's nothing here to indicate a reason for these extreme boundaries, and it doesn't just affect OP. I don't think she's an asshole, but I feel for both of them.\n\nETA: NAH", "Or worse.... a wanted unwanted felon", "They don\u2019t even know where OP works or studied in school. At this rate, the nephew won\u2019t know OP existed.", "How come you get to enjoy old photos of them and don't reciprocate? They're not for you, they're for people who care about you.", "If that family member refused to say what they do for a living,  where they went to school,  and refused pictures my mind would go to something nefarious.  I wouldn't let them around my child either.", "If my sister wouldn\u2019t tell me what her degree was in, where she went to school, what she did for work, or anything else about her life I\u2019d assume she was selling drugs, sex, or both. I may still allow closely supervised visits but yeah I\u2019d be pretty paranoid about it", "How would you feel about Polaroids you kept at your place?", "OP, please edit your original post to include this Facebook post information.\n\nIt seems an important piece of information, especially when it comes to the amount of privacy you have.", " Info: Why haven\u2019t you told her that you don\u2019t want a picture taken (and posted) and giving her a chance to respect your boundary instead of going away from your nephew every time you see her with the cellphone?  That kind of makes you an asshole in my eyes.", "I think we found OP's other main account.", "My mother makes books every year of photos of her grandchildren, including photos with friends and family, from that year. It's one of their birthday presents. They range in age from 18 months to 18 years, and they all LOVE looking at their books, especially the 3YO and 6YO. I'm in my 30s and also love looking at old pictures. I get OP not wanting them on social media, but it's a shame she is depriving her nephew of that opportunity and could affect their relationship.", "I feel like those people can at least say they work in the military or for the government or something but I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s family even gets that kind of vague answer about work stuff.", "And Hitler was a bit eccentric. No, this is incredibly extreme to the point of crippling relationships.", "So you couldn't accept a simple no but kept chasing him after he told you no? And you complain about looking like a fool?", "You don't think having to care for her severely unwell mother and then having her die while still a teenager is an issue that is likely to have caused trauma???", "Forgive me, but my dysfunctional family is not the reason. They taught me how to be more secretive and private. But that is not why I do it.\n\nI just like being private. Always have. Ever since I was 3 (that's as far back as the stories go).\n\n###Edit:\n\nJust to clarify, the point is not about what the reasons are.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is that people like us rarely care about how weird or alienating we may seem to other people.\n\nAnd the reason for that is that we prioritise our own sanity / mental health over the need for conformity.", "Maybe bcz it\u2019s after her and gaining", "\" I'm not paranoid if it's real\" - OP, probably", "I have to wonder *what* OP talks to her family about, if not about anything in her life?\n\nAlso, why even spend time with them? They seem more like strangers than family.", "That her choice isn\u2019t it ? Who are you to say she needs to tell anyone her business", "I would assume they were involved in something criminal or morally questionable and that would put an end to them being around my children.", "i would assume that family member didnt want me in their life in all honestly \ud83d\ude10", "They know what I look like too.", "No way.\n\nIf it makes YOU feel unwell, it is not important that others want it.", "Or which degree they chose", "It struck me as excessive as well, but it may also mean they never asked/were interested?\n\nFrom this and from OP being the sole caregiver to her mom I sense some very strange family dynamics.", "I did stop after he told me that but we were also in the same clubs/labs together and whenever the group would hang out I would be severely awkward around him- so it's less me chasing him and honestly just how I reacted to (and sometimes still react to) him just existing lol. Ever just say the stupidest shit bc your brain just dies? Like one time we were studying and he was like \"fuck me\" and before my filter kicked in my response \"bend over and I will\"- so that is not an uncommon slip up around people I find attractive\n\nAlso it did not help that he still wanted to maintain a friendship and there was an awkward period where I did try to pull away initially and he kept inviting me to places (coffee/boba) and me assuming (bc he rejected me) that everyone else would be there and I would show up and it would be just him which led me to think he was low key interested back\n\nAfter I learned he was in a relationship, I unfortunately had to just drop the friend group, which was the only way to keep a boundary since bc no one else knew he was dating someone. They all kept trying to put us together and it wasn't my place to disclose he was in a relationship so.....\n\n Definitely dumb early 20s with shit communication.", "I actually kind of wonder if OP is involved in something shady and not legal.", "Op literally posted here to solicit strangers opinions.", "It absolutely is! And I never said otherwise. All I said is that if she decides to make this choice she needs to be realistic about what it means, and that she\u2019s likely to deal with people confused by it for her entire life. \n\nAnd her making this choice doesn\u2019t mean that every single person she ever interacts with has to curb their own behavior to contort to this very unusual lifestyle. She is absolutely free to live her life as she pleases, but can\u2019t really get upset when others don\u2019t choose the same for themselves, and/or think OP\u2019s choice isn\u2019t something they\u2019re going to go out of their way to assist with.", "Also, what would you talk about if you didn\u2019t talk about your day to day. When I see my family, we discuss who I went out for coffee with, what activity I did and who I did it with. My mum wants to know how my friends dad is doing and for me to send them her best wishes. University is years long and to not tell them which one you went to is so fucking strange. My brother would ask me what assignments I\u2019m working and we discuss what project he\u2019s doing atm. This is so strange. If my brother wouldn\u2019t tell me what his degree subject was, I\u2019d not have him in my life", "If you truly think that that is all that photographs are for then I feel for you.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
