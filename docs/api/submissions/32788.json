She was telling her manager at work about my wedding including the location. Apparently, her manager got excited and said that she will be near country X at the time when the wedding is scheduled and asked my mum if she could come along. I think it was the initial shock from the fact that her manager (a woman whom I don't know AT ALL - not even her name nor what she looks like) asked my mum point blank if she could come, but I bluntly said \"No\". She asked why and I simply replied with \"I don't know her\" but her argument was that she knows her.

I kept quiet hoping she would leave it, but she started to ask if my fianc\u00e9's dad was allowed to have a friend. I said yes because he actually knows that friend and that friend has watched him grow up whereas I don't know her manager at all. It is also important to point out that my future FIL has been contributing to the wedding costs, but my parents have yet to contribute a single pound. They keep promising that they will early next year - so we will see. Anyway, when I told my mum this, she got upset and said that she should be allowed a friend. She started to talk about how they spend so much time together, go on hikes together, etc. I became fed up and reminded that I don't know her manager at all and that her manager is just a friend now but probably won't be in two years. She kept quiet for a while. I could tell that she was not happy. She then said that my attitude towards friendships was wrong and that I should not be thinking about them ending. The rest of the conversation was off and we said goodnight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still think it's a weird request especially when said manager just asked to come - I have never heard of anyone doing this but I am new to weddings; I have never attended one and I don't know what's normal and what isn't.

This is a wedding not a backyard BBQ.  The audacity of your mom\u2019s manager is impressive.  It\u2019s tacky and rude to try to invite yourself to any event but especially a wedding where you don\u2019t know the host.  Weddings cost money.  Why would pay for a stranger to eat and drink at a wedding.  Your mom needs to respect what you said and let it.  Also stop JADE-ing. No is a complete sentence.  The more you explain the more she will argue. \n\nI had this same problem when I got married. We were planning a micro wedding and I was strict with the guest list.  Only close family and friends.  My husband\u2019s mother told him that she was going to travel with a friend and bring her to the wedding.  I said absolutely not.  I was not having some rando that my husband hadn\u2019t even heard watching us get married and eating a five course dinner.  I said she can travel with whomever she wants but they were not allowed at wedding.  Period.  If she needed help getting to the wedding her other son or daughter could bring her.  Side note they refused to travel with her because she\u2019s a hot ass mess.  Also we paid for the wedding ourselves so no you aren\u2019t going to TELL me that you are bringing anyone.

It was under 15 people. Mostly family and very very close friends+spouses.\n\nWe were flying in, when I heard that the groom's parents last minute invited this couple that were complete strangers to both the bride and groom .\n\nThey just happen to be vacationing in the same country, and practically wedding crashed. \n\nIt was so ODD. \nAmong all these photos of their nearest and dearest, was this random couple! Who didn't know them at all.\n At one point the coordinator got confused, and gave a boutonniere to the Male Stranger. It was for the father of the bride! Why did he possibly think he deserved a boutonniere is beyond me.", "NTA. Aren\u2019t your mom and dad coming as a couple? Can\u2019t they be each other\u2019s company. Why do they need to bring friends? Especially ones you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a wedding not a potluck.", "INFO are your parents still married to each other?", "[deleted]", "This is tough for me. we had a similar thing happen at our wedding. Random friends invited by our parents and one of our guests invited their parents. I was also a destination wedding and pretty small group so it was very weird. We said no but did let each set of parents invite 2 friends because we did not hear the end of it. That said we paid for our whole wedding. If your parents are contributing I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the same. I\u2019m gonna say NTA but if she\u2019s forking over money she should get to invite her friend", "Whatever happened to plus 1 invites?  Weddings seem over curated these days. \nWho will your mom know at this?", "NTA but I would allow my mom to invite this friend/manager as a goodwill gesture", "[removed]", "LOL. She wants a plus one option for parents? Are they in an open relationship? Why does your mom need a plus one? Should your DAD be that? This is so odd. Its baffling.", "NTA. \n\nIt's a ridiculous ask, and I don't think much of her friend for asking if she could \"come along\" as if it were a bowling night instead of a wedding.", "NTA. Has she invited her manager to her house? That's enough. Manager wants one free stop during her holidays. Manager isn't a friend. And your mom doesn't have the right to throw a tantrum. Manger would not be interested and invite herself if this happened in the US. Tell her to go to DisneylandParis instead", "NTA.   It\u2019s not usual for people to bring friends to weddings at all.    I know some people say you can invite a plus one, but that\u2019s normally single people who possibly might not know lots of the guest lost so they have someone there they know other than the bride/groom who are likely to be trying to socialise with loads of people.     I\u2019d not expect married parents to bring a plus one/friend.", "NTA.  Your reasoning is sound and the manager inviting herself along is poor etiquette and weird.  How amazing she'll just \"happen to be nearby\" around your wedding, too.  Is your wedding in a special venue that manager is trying to get into for clout?  \n\n\nFor my wedding, MIL (long single) asked for a friend for a plus one.  It was her bestie, someone my ex husband knew very well and I knew in passing.  That was fine to me.  Bestie got sick week of wedding and MIL asked to sub in another friend (one of several years, a neighbour).  We said sure thing.  Our best man also asked if HIS mom could come because she knew ex-husband very well, and we said okay since there was room on the list and she ALSO knew MIL well.  It kept her happy with a little social circle of comfort along with ex's uncle and aunt.    \n\n\nBut if MIL had wanted to invite her church ladies eg to our small wedding?  HECK NO.", "Hi guys,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for your comments. They have been extremely insightful and somewhat amusing. I am going to address a few things here: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. My parents are still married BUT it has been a very turbulent relationship. Without going into all the details (because it is a super long story), it was so rough at one point that a restraining order was issued against my dad and for a whole year, he was not allowed in the house. That's all I will say. \n2. I am inviting my mum's side of the family so all of her siblings and family will be there. She also knows a quite few of my school friends. \n3. I am 99.9% confident that the friendship between my manager and my mum is not romantic because she is a very God fearing Christian woman but more importantly, when I thought back to it last night, my mum has a pattern with friendships where she really gets attached to them, they let her down and then the friendship ends. As a result, my mum really doesn't have any close close friends.\n4. The location is a beautiful natural spot in country X. I would not be surprised if the manager wanted to attend just for Instagram or clout. \n5. After speaking about it with my fianc\u00e9, I realised that the main source of my opposition to her request stems from the fact that first and foremost, I don't believe that she should be blurring the professional and personal lines. As some of you pointed out, I don't think she should be blurring those lines. Secondly, as some of you also said, I hated the fact that her manager just asked to come. It was appalled me so much that it made me think that she's going to annoy me at my wedding. \n6. After sleeping on the matter, I am considering allowing my mum to invite a friend who I know and like, but that friend can only come to the reception (ceremony venue has limited capacity) --> But I will only offer this to her (and my dad) once we receive the money.", "NTA. However, why doesn\u2019t your mom\u2019s manager invite HER to join her in country Z as an extended vacation and chance to travel together?", "I wouldn't even invite myself to a backyard BBQ. Why do some people think it's ok to invite themselves to other people's events?", "My thought, too.", "That\u2019s what I thought.", "Yes, they are", "Her mom can social with her friend anytime outside the wedding.", "Her own husband, or ex, it's unclear. Her daughter? Other relatives?", "She did not say they weren\u2019t, but it is customary when finances allow for the parents to contribute. Like she said her future FIL has done.", "[deleted]", "She did. And she said \"no'. Mom's the one nit dropping it."]}
