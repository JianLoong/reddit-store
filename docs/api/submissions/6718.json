Moreover, if your home situation suddenly changes this drastically, will the adoption even go ahead as scheduled? Do you think perhaps this is more related to panic about expanding your family on your solo wage than the actual likelihood of being laid off? After all, your wages don't put you more at risk of redundancy if you are an important player in your company, which it sounds like you are.

What she now has is the possibility of having less time for her two existing children even without adding to the brood, having to adapt to a new schedule, figure out how to juggle it all while pretending to be OK with it when actually she isn't and there is no actual genuine reason being supplied to her as to why her life is being turned upside down at this critical point in raising her children.
