My roommate and I have been getting along okay with a few minor exceptions relating to him being loud, but after a few discussions I thought we were good. I got him to start closing his door quietly and we agreed to communicate in advance if someone was coming over. \n\nRecently, he started dating this girl and she\u2019s always spending the night. It started off as a once every two weeks kinda thing, but now she\u2019s here every other night. They talk loud, she has zero noise control or courtesy, and I\u2019ve already been woken up by her loud laughter and conversations after a long day at my internship. My roommate and I had a small conflict over this, where he apologized and promised to keep it down, and we left it at that.\n\nJust now though, I was heading to bed and started hearing loud thumping and sex noises coming from their room. Our apartment is already tiny enough, so I could obviously hear every moan and every sound. It wasn\u2019t obnoxiously loud, but it\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t give a shit that it was midnight and I could\u2019ve been sleeping. I was pretty annoyed since it was late, so when I got done with the bathroom, I flushed the toilet and coughed a bit, making my presence clear. After they still continued with their loud activities, I said screw it, walked back to my room, and shut my door quite loud.\n\nThat got them to finally quiet down and I think she ended up leaving. Or maybe not, I\u2019m too tired to tell. But the noises finally stopped. My roommate however, left his bedroom to clean himself up, and slammed his door when re-entering, so he obviously got my hint and isn\u2019t too happy about it. I know I was being petty, but I genuinely don\u2019t even care that she\u2019s over. It\u2019s just the loud noises that got to my head. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701928508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cox8w/aita_for_shutting_my_door_while_my_roommate_was/", "score": 511, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(This is sarcasm by the way, otherwise, ew.)\n\nIn seriousness though, if the inconsiderate nature of your roommate is actually affecting your sleep or performance at work then it's not unreasonable to let him know if it continues you will have no choice but to file a complaint.\n\nI'm not saying this will improve the dynamic between you, rather it may make it worse, but at least you fairly warned them.", "Who cares if you\u2019re the AH here - he definitely is. So I guess maybe and so is he. I\u2019m not sure what options you had in the moment", "NTA,", "NTA. I get that he has his own room, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have to be courteous to you and the other people in the dorm. You\u2019ve had this conversation with him before about the noise levels, yet he didn\u2019t change his behavior or ask the girlfriend to keep it down. \n\nYou could have done much worse than slamming a door.", "NTA  \nYou've already had conversations about him being loud and had came to certain agreements regarding it. But it sounds like he had decided to ignore those agreements and continue on with his loud fuckery.   \nI think you did the right thing by slamming your door even though some may call it cock blocking.  \nyou're living together so you have to be accommodating towards each other instead of ignoring each other's feeling towards certain activities.", "NTA he forgets he doesn't live alone.", "NTA - if slamming the door loud was taken as rude, then they clearly knew they were being loud and your roommate was probably mad cause he couldn\u2019t have sex longer. \n\nMaybe the gf didn\u2019t realize you could hear anything and now that she does hopefully they\u2019re quieter. \n\nEither way he\u2019s TA.

Dorms are to study not to hook up. To boot he is living like he's the only one there.", "The answers people post to this will be very telling lol", "NTA but also this is your first taste of roommates. you're in college, people are gonna have sex, you probably will too, and it's probably not always going to revolve around making sure no one is in an adjoining room. They're in a bedroom with the door closed, maybe get some ear plugs and try to recognize you'll probably be on the other end of the same situation some day. You're going to be sharing small space with this person for a long time, is dead silence really worth ruining their fun, or is it something you could cope with and bank some goodwill?", "NTA. You did literally nothing wrong. You're allowed to use your own apartment. What they did was downright disrespectful.", "He finally got the memo huh.

Instead of being quiet-ish he's disrupting his roommate and not letting him sleep. This is why most dorms have rules which are basically to keep the peace. To boot OP mentioned that she is sleeping over now practically every other night. Two people are supposed to live there not three. Again, if the roommate was being respectful I ain't got nothing about it, but the fact the roommate is living like it's his place and he's the only one there is a big issue. Why should OP risk failing classes when he can't get rest and study in peace for the sake of someone getting laid?", "I agree it is the roommate who is responsible for creating the conflict here and ultimately who will be responsible for fixing it. I just don\u2019t like when people jump to go to some authority over any interpersonal conflict. This is hardly some exceptional circumstance lol, it\u2019s college, people are going to hear their roommates having sex in dorms at inconvenient times. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s ok that the roommate is doing it and inconveniencing OP. It does mean that it\u2019s a common enough thing that someone else isn\u2019t always going to be there to step in and solve your problems for you. Growing our skills at things is good and overreliance on authorities halts our own development and creates dangerous situation when, in many cases, the authorities in a given context are dangerous.\n\nNow, if OP is at their wits\u2019 end with this thats reasonable, and approaching an RA for help with a challenging roommate situation could be a step forward. That\u2019s a different thing though than \u201creport him\u201d", "NTA I'm assuming she also lives somewhere. They can go live a p*rno there.

Are you just guessing that he thinks you're the asshole or has he actually called you an asshole?

But stop being petty and instead knock annoyingly at their door while they\u2019re \u2018busy\u2019 until they respond and ask if they can keep it down.

You want to live on your terms go rent solo privately", "Was gonna say ESH because slamming doors to send a message is not really a great tactic and it sounds like you could\u2019ve addressed it after the fact based on how your roommate\u2019s responded to reasonable interactions before.

Time for a new housemate to who is respectful", "NTA but I think you need a hobby for when they're keeping you up. \n\nMight I suggest learning to play the vuvuzela?", "NTA I do the same thing when my roommate puts the ac on in the middle of the night and forgets to turn it off. I slam my door and he sends me a msg like \u201cf*** u had to wake me up but I\u2019m sorry\u201d it\u2019s petty but feels good.", "Some girls are ridiculously loud with their moaning", "NTA- I'm petty so I'd be getting up at 5:30am tomorrow to make the world's loudest cup of coffee and stack of pancakes. \n\nStudent apartments are not known for being particularly noise friendly but the polite thing to do is at least attempt to be quiet after midnight.", "Definitely not. They should at least try to keep it down when they know other people are in the house. He wouldn't like it if you did the same thing. You are NOT the A-hole", "NTA. I\u2019d shut my door too.", "NTA and thats weird as fuck. ur roommate should take into account ur living there too!", "NTA. I deal with neighbours who have parties till 3am and I have to be up at like 5 or 6 am sometimes. And since their backyard is by where my room used to be (I moved rooms when my brother moved out) I could hear everything they did. So I got fed up one day and went off on them and told them to STFU and called the cops. It\u2019s not juvenile at all. It\u2019s called being respectful. And he\u2019s not doing that.", "The hothead in me would have gotten up and immediately re-slammed my door several times. If it's war he wants, it's war he gets. I lived with several people before, and was always a loud fucker, but knew when I hit the limits and the onus was on me!", "Not everyone is obsessed with fucking all the time.", "I don\u2019t think your fit for dorm life if you think it\u2019s reasonable to tell your college roommate he can only have sex on weekends", "It wasn't intended to shame them. It was intended as honest communication about the situation. Perhaps growing up in a very liberal place has given me an atypical perspective, but I generally find that people are more receptive when you outline how a behavior crosses very common boundaries as opposed to litigating when behavior is \"rude\" or \"inconsiderate\". That way leads to annoying discussions about dishes, clean toilets, etc."]}
