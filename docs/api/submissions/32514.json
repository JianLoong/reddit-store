{"id": 32514, "submission_id": "18cox8w", "title": "AITA For shutting my door while my roommate was having loud intercourse with his girlfriend?", "selftext": "I live in a college dorm with two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a common area. My roommate and I have been getting along okay with a few minor exceptions relating to him being loud, but after a few discussions I thought we were good. I got him to start closing his door quietly and we agreed to communicate in advance if someone was coming over. \n\nRecently, he started dating this girl and she\u2019s always spending the night. It started off as a once every two weeks kinda thing, but now she\u2019s here every other night. They talk loud, she has zero noise control or courtesy, and I\u2019ve already been woken up by her loud laughter and conversations after a long day at my internship. My roommate and I had a small conflict over this, where he apologized and promised to keep it down, and we left it at that.\n\nJust now though, I was heading to bed and started hearing loud thumping and sex noises coming from their room. Our apartment is already tiny enough, so I could obviously hear every moan and every sound. It wasn\u2019t obnoxiously loud, but it\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t give a shit that it was midnight and I could\u2019ve been sleeping. I was pretty annoyed since it was late, so when I got done with the bathroom, I flushed the toilet and coughed a bit, making my presence clear. After they still continued with their loud activities, I said screw it, walked back to my room, and shut my door quite loud.\n\nThat got them to finally quiet down and I think she ended up leaving. Or maybe not, I\u2019m too tired to tell. But the noises finally stopped. My roommate however, left his bedroom to clean himself up, and slammed his door when re-entering, so he obviously got my hint and isn\u2019t too happy about it. I know I was being petty, but I genuinely don\u2019t even care that she\u2019s over. It\u2019s just the loud noises that got to my head. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701928508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cox8w/aita_for_shutting_my_door_while_my_roommate_was/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(This is sarcasm by the way, otherwise, ew.)\n\nIn seriousness though, if the inconsiderate nature of your roommate is actually affecting your sleep or performance at work then it's not unreasonable to let him know if it continues you will have no choice but to file a complaint.\n\nI'm not saying this will improve the dynamic between you, rather it may make it worse, but at least you fairly warned them.", "Who cares if you\u2019re the AH here - he definitely is. So I guess maybe and so is he. I\u2019m not sure what options you had in the moment", "NTA,", "NTA. I get that he has his own room, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have to be courteous to you and the other people in the dorm. You\u2019ve had this conversation with him before about the noise levels, yet he didn\u2019t change his behavior or ask the girlfriend to keep it down. \n\nYou could have done much worse than slamming a door.", "NTA  \nYou've already had conversations about him being loud and had came to certain agreements regarding it. But it sounds like he had decided to ignore those agreements and continue on with his loud fuckery.   \nI think you did the right thing by slamming your door even though some may call it cock blocking.  \nyou're living together so you have to be accommodating towards each other instead of ignoring each other's feeling towards certain activities.", "NTA he forgets he doesn't live alone.", "NTA - if slamming the door loud was taken as rude, then they clearly knew they were being loud and your roommate was probably mad cause he couldn\u2019t have sex longer. \n\nMaybe the gf didn\u2019t realize you could hear anything and now that she does hopefully they\u2019re quieter. \n\nEither he TA. And, I\u2019d be petty too if he talked he didn\u2019t listen and was interrupting my sleep.", "NTA screw your roommate time to report him because I am pretty certain he's in violation of dorm rules. Dorms are to study not to hook up. To boot he is living like he's the only one there.", "The answers people post to this will be very telling lol", "NTA but also this is your first taste of roommates. you're in college, people are gonna have sex, you probably will too, and it's probably not always going to revolve around making sure no one is in an adjoining room. They're in a bedroom with the door closed, maybe get some ear plugs and try to recognize you'll probably be on the other end of the same situation some day. You're going to be sharing small space with this person for a long time, is dead silence really worth ruining their fun, or is it something you could cope with and bank some goodwill?", "NTA. You did literally nothing wrong. You're allowed to use your own apartment. What they did was downright disrespectful.", "He finally got the memo huh. NTA", "Yeah I don\u2019t know what else I could\u2019ve done. Like I get it they were doing their thing, but at least wait till the weekend any maybe let me know your girl is gonna be over right? Like this midnight thing is annoying", "OP is NTA but wtf the idea of reporting someone for such a normal ass conflict is wild. \u201cDorms are to study not to hook up\u201d sounds like something an out of touch sitcom dad would say, they\u2019re a living space.", "> screw your roommate\n\nI think we can assume that the roommate has had enough screwing for the night", "The thing is at this point his roommate is being completely disrespectful of OP. Instead of being quiet-ish he's disrupting his roommate and not letting him sleep. This is why most dorms have rules which are basically to keep the peace. To boot OP mentioned that she is sleeping over now practically every other night. Two people are supposed to live there not three. Again, if the roommate was being respectful I ain't got nothing about it, but the fact the roommate is living like it's his place and he's the only one there is a big issue. Why should OP risk failing classes when he can't get rest and study in peace for the sake of someone getting laid?", "I agree it is the roommate who is responsible for creating the conflict here and ultimately who will be responsible for fixing it. I just don\u2019t like when people jump to go to some authority over any interpersonal conflict. This is hardly some exceptional circumstance lol, it\u2019s college, people are going to hear their roommates having sex in dorms at inconvenient times. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s ok that the roommate is doing it and inconveniencing OP. It does mean that it\u2019s a common enough thing that someone else isn\u2019t always going to be there to step in and solve your problems for you. Growing our skills at things is good and overreliance on authorities halts our own development and creates dangerous situation when, in many cases, the authorities in a given context are dangerous.\n\nNow, if OP is at their wits\u2019 end with this thats reasonable, and approaching an RA for help with a challenging roommate situation could be a step forward. That\u2019s a different thing though than \u201creport him\u201d"]}
