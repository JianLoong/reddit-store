{"id": 32514, "submission_id": "18cox8w", "title": "AITA For shutting my door while my roommate was having loud intercourse with his girlfriend?", "selftext": "I live in a college dorm with two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a common area. My roommate and I have been getting along okay with a few minor exceptions relating to him being loud, but after a few discussions I thought we were good. I got him to start closing his door quietly and we agreed to communicate in advance if someone was coming over. \n\nRecently, he started dating this girl and she\u2019s always spending the night. It started off as a once every two weeks kinda thing, but now she\u2019s here every other night. They talk loud, she has zero noise control or courtesy, and I\u2019ve already been woken up by her loud laughter and conversations after a long day at my internship. My roommate and I had a small conflict over this, where he apologized and promised to keep it down, and we left it at that.\n\nJust now though, I was heading to bed and started hearing loud thumping and sex noises coming from their room. Our apartment is already tiny enough, so I could obviously hear every moan and every sound. It wasn\u2019t obnoxiously loud, but it\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t give a shit that it was midnight and I could\u2019ve been sleeping. I was pretty annoyed since it was late, so when I got done with the bathroom, I flushed the toilet and coughed a bit, making my presence clear. After they still continued with their loud activities, I said screw it, walked back to my room, and shut my door quite loud.\n\nThat got them to finally quiet down and I think she ended up leaving. Or maybe not, I\u2019m too tired to tell. But the noises finally stopped. My roommate however, left his bedroom to clean himself up, and slammed his door when re-entering, so he obviously got my hint and isn\u2019t too happy about it. I know I was being petty, but I genuinely don\u2019t even care that she\u2019s over. It\u2019s just the loud noises that got to my head. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701928508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cox8w/aita_for_shutting_my_door_while_my_roommate_was/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(This is sarcasm by the way, otherwise, ew.)\n\nIn seriousness though, if the inconsiderate nature of your roommate is actually affecting your sleep or performance at work then it's not unreasonable to let him know if it continues you will have no choice but to file a complaint.\n\nI'm not saying this will improve the dynamic between you, rather it may make it worse, but at least you fairly warned them.", "Who cares if you\u2019re the AH here - he definitely is. So I guess maybe and so is he. I\u2019m not sure what options you had in the moment", "NTA,", "NTA. I get that he has his own room, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have to be courteous to you and the other people in the dorm. You\u2019ve had this conversation with him before about the noise levels, yet he didn\u2019t change his behavior or ask the girlfriend to keep it down. \n\nYou could have done much worse than slamming a door.", "NTA  \nYou've already had conversations about him being loud and had came to certain agreements regarding it. But it sounds like he had decided to ignore those agreements and continue on with his loud fuckery.   \nI think you did the right thing by slamming your door even though some may call it cock blocking.  \nyou're living together so you have to be accommodating towards each other instead of ignoring each other's feeling towards certain activities.", "NTA he forgets he doesn't live alone.", "NTA - if slamming the door loud was taken as rude, then they clearly knew they were being loud and your roommate was probably mad cause he couldn\u2019t have sex longer. \n\nMaybe the gf didn\u2019t realize you could hear anything and now that she does hopefully they\u2019re quieter. \n\nEither he TA. And, I\u2019d be petty too if he talked he didn\u2019t listen and was interrupting my sleep.", "NTA screw your roommate time to report him because I am pretty certain he's in violation of dorm rules. Dorms are to study not to hook up. To boot he is living like he's the only one there.", "The answers people post to this will be very telling lol", "NTA but also this is your first taste of roommates. you're in college, people are gonna have sex, you probably will too, and it's probably not always going to revolve around making sure no one is in an adjoining room. They're in a bedroom with the door closed, maybe get some ear plugs and try to recognize you'll probably be on the other end of the same situation some day. You're going to be sharing small space with this person for a long time, is dead silence really worth ruining their fun, or is it something you could cope with and bank some goodwill?", "NTA. You did literally nothing wrong. You're allowed to use your own apartment. What they did was downright disrespectful.", "He finally got the memo huh. NTA", "Yeah I don\u2019t know what else I could\u2019ve done. Like I get it they were doing their thing, but at least wait till the weekend any maybe let me know your girl is gonna be over right? Like this midnight thing is annoying", "OP is NTA but wtf the idea of reporting someone for such a normal ass conflict is wild. \u201cDorms are to study not to hook up\u201d sounds like something an out of touch sitcom dad would say, they\u2019re a living space.", "> screw your roommate\n\nI think we can assume that the roommate has had enough screwing for the night", "The thing is at this point his roommate is being completely disrespectful of OP. Instead of being quiet-ish he's disrupting his roommate and not letting him sleep. This is why most dorms have rules which are basically to keep the peace. To boot OP mentioned that she is sleeping over now practically every other night. Two people are supposed to live there not three. Again, if the roommate was being respectful I ain't got nothing about it, but the fact the roommate is living like it's his place and he's the only one there is a big issue. Why should OP risk failing classes when he can't get rest and study in peace for the sake of someone getting laid?", "I agree it is the roommate who is responsible for creating the conflict here and ultimately who will be responsible for fixing it. I just don\u2019t like when people jump to go to some authority over any interpersonal conflict. This is hardly some exceptional circumstance lol, it\u2019s college, people are going to hear their roommates having sex in dorms at inconvenient times. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s ok that the roommate is doing it and inconveniencing OP. It does mean that it\u2019s a common enough thing that someone else isn\u2019t always going to be there to step in and solve your problems for you. Growing our skills at things is good and overreliance on authorities halts our own development and creates dangerous situation when, in many cases, the authorities in a given context are dangerous.\n\nNow, if OP is at their wits\u2019 end with this thats reasonable, and approaching an RA for help with a challenging roommate situation could be a step forward. That\u2019s a different thing though than \u201creport him\u201d", "NTA I'm assuming she also lives somewhere. They can go live a p*rno there. It's not like you knocked and asked them to keep it down. Lol", "Why is it so hard to be respectful of others and their space? Your requests were ignored Everytime you had talked with about the loud noises? It\u2019s not so much the noises but I feel the timing of those noises is off. Boundaries bruh, set them in place and enforce them to your roommate and his guests. Walking on eggshells or n your own home is no way to live. Just my opinion though", "NTA and better than me, I yelled to my roommate to shut the fuck up because I could hear them from my room downstairs with headphones on lmao.", "NTA. I don't understand what the problem is with you closing your door. \n.", "NTA", "NTA Have you considered playing a porn video up loud back at them. If he says anything, say \"oh sorry dude, listening to you guys got me a bit heated so I was having a wank and didn't realise I was being loud\".", "NTA", "He can quiet down or deal with the fact that he's bothering you.\n\nHe is the asshole btw. That's some 16 y/o behavior", "NTA ohh nooo did you make your roommate uncomfortable with loud noise? That's a shame.", "Dude\u2026 this whole problem could be solved with a simple pair of noise cancelling headphones. When I went to college literally everyone owned a pair. Why you may ask? Because sometimes your neighbor is gonna do the nasty at 1am.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but don\u2019t go and act like there are no options.", "Why are you posting this before actually talking to him about this specific event? Are you just guessing that he thinks you're the asshole or has he actually called you an asshole? Go communicate with your roommate.", "NTA - in this situation the only solution would be to turn on some porn and turn it up just loud enough so they can hear it.", "NTA. But stop being petty and instead knock annoyingly at their door while they\u2019re \u2018busy\u2019 until they respond and ask if they can keep it down. Do this every time u til they figure it out.", "NTA but this is one of the things about sharing a house with someone. You want to live on your terms go rent solo privately", "Was gonna say ESH because slamming doors to send a message is not really a great tactic and it sounds like you could\u2019ve addressed it after the fact based on how your roommate\u2019s responded to reasonable interactions before. But think I\u2019m  actually leaning towards NAH because hearing roommates having sex in college is relatively normal and slamming doors ain\u2019t all that bad. Talk to your roommate when the girlfriend\u2019s not around and it\u2019ll probably all be okay.", "Your generation is doomed.", "Alright so here\u2019s the deal \u2026. Your nta for shutting your door , and I understand what you\u2019d like \n\n but your the asshole for acting like a child in your expectations that your roommate who pays just as much as you to be there to have to tippy toe around you and your expectations. . Especially since it comes across as petty and jealousy of him having a gf \n\nIf you can\u2019t handle what comes along with shared accommodations then find a place for just you otherwise find your self a partner and have sex wars .", "NTA - but also slamming the door is an escalation. Then the roommate escalated also. Some people here offer you bad advice be escalating further.\n\nThis is a normal ass conflict.\n\nYou roommate is in love or something with a loud person. He wants to spend time with her. He wants to have sex.\n\nYou want  your sleep.\n\nYou both need are totally ok. Start talking about facts and figure it out.", "Dude you\u2019re in school with a roommate.  He has a girlfriend.  Deal.  YT (extremely privileged) A", "Why didn\u2019t you just bust in and join the festivities? Sounds like an invitation to me.", "ESH. \n\nIm not even sure I believe how horrible your roommate is given how uptight you seem. Buy earplugs or move out.", "AH + AH = NTA\n\nLOL.\n\nThey don't respect you, then do what you gotta do.", "NAH, lmao I doubt this will be the only time you experience this issue and you might find yourself on the other side of a similar situation. It tends to be part and parcel of having roommates and thin walls. You might want to invest in some ear plugs or something. I\u2019ve found ear plugs + white noise to be very effected.", "Nta \nBut until you\u2019re able to resolve this, do you have earplugs?", "Who cares?", "Idk last time you went to college but dorms are 100% okay to hook up in and aren\u2019t just meant for studying. These are young adults out on their own learning life and guess what young adults have sex", "what do u mean by that", ">Talk to your roommate when the girlfriend\u2019s not around and it\u2019ll probably all be okay.\n\n\nLike all the other times he has talked to him?", ">but your the asshole for acting like a child in your expectations that your roommate who pays just as much as you to be there to have to tippy toe around you and your expectations\n\n\n\nNo one is asking for anyone to tiptoe. Op is asking that they not be loud. \n\nThey have had discussions about it and agreement to that effect. It doesn't fly out the window for sex", ">Dude you\u2019re in school with a roommate. \n\nSo Op gets this memo and his roommate doesn't just because he has a gf? \n\nIf the shoe was on the other foot, will roommate be happy ?", "No. AH + AH = ESH", "It's rude and juvenile. Tell him that you have not consented to being a participant in the exhibitionist kink he and his girlfriend obviously have and that it's unacceptable to include someone in your kink without their permission.", "I do know of an obnoxious method, why not give it a try. When they are in the middle of their nightly duties, knock on their door, call it an emergency, and when he answers your door, greet him and his GF, engage him in a not so urgent conversation for a few minutes (not more than 5 minutes), thank them both and then leave. Repeat it a few times (to kill their libido) and they'll be quiet so not to disturb your sleep. Edited to add this: Mind you be polite always during the conversation and any resulting arguments.", "OP or his parents are paying a shit load to have that dorm. Basic common courtesy is not too much to expect.", "Whatever.\n\nIn life sometimes you are the roommate sometimes you are the OP.  Dude your buddy is getting some good action and all you have to say it\u2019s hurrrrr it\u2019s too loud.  Massive A.", "This", "If you go to the RA you are reporting him. The RA is the one that handles complaints and furthers them on. Again this is a dorm, not an apartment so they are designed for studying students. The only one here that is not growing skills is the one causing the issue."]}
