But you can communicate clearly that if he does, he is crossing a serious line in your relationship and crossing your boundaries. If he still goes, he is showing you where his priorities lie. Then you get to decide how you move forward with your life after he has made that clear to you.\n\nETA: For those of you claiming I am being unfair to OPs husband and a bad person for telling her to \u2018just leave\u2019 -\n\nI am not telling OP to leave her husband, reread my comment. She states pretty clearly she does not want him to attend. All I am encouraging is open communication.\nIf it is a final straw for her whether or no he attends, then that\u2019s a fact and her decision. She needs to make him aware of those feelings. HE then needs to decide if wants to prioritise saving their relationship or his own desire for the weekend away. \n\nI did not say which priority he should decide, simply that he had to decide one or the other. To go or not to go. And his wife needs to let him know exactly how she feels about those choices, whether she is in the right or not. They need to communicate that. \n\nIf the wife feels slighted by him going, then she needs to decide what she wants from their relationship going forward. That could be therapy, communicating and deciding on some goals together so they can find some peace and fairness in their marriage, or it could be leaving him. He also has the same choices.\n\nPostpartum issues can really mess with a marriage. I am a stay at home mother of two and I well understand that. My husband and I both dealt with various degrees of PPD. What matters is whether or not you view your marriage as worth fighting for, or not. That\u2019s the choice both OP and her husband need to make for themselves.", "NTA. Are you getting a \"once in a lifetime\" break too? Somehow I doubt it given that you have a 3 month old who depends on you for food.", "NTA - First off, your new baby is only 3 months old and you have a 3yo as well.  He needs to be a father first.  If your baby was older and sleeping through the night he might have more of an argument, but leaving you alone with two children that young when you are exhausted and won't be able to get a decent sleep is just plain irresponsible and dangerous.  Secondly, if you're uncomfortable with him being around strippers, he needs to respect your feelings and your marriage.  He can visit with his friends some other time.  He could take the new husband-to-be out to dinner and give him all the advice on what being a married man is about...like not drooling over strippers while your wife is breastfeeding your newborn baby.\n\nYes, it's important that you both get a little down time.  But that doesn't involve being a 6hr drive away.  How would he feel if one of the kids got seriously injured and he couldn't get home because he was too drunk to drive and 6 hours away even if he was sober.  It's just a bad idea.", "NTA. it\u2019s going to be exhausting for sure so I get where you\u2019re coming from. If he goes to the bachelor party you should be able to get a little break too.", "NTA.\n\nTaking care of your kids and helping out your wife is more important than getting drunk and watching strippers. If he wants to go out can't he do something more local with his friends?", "NTA - there should be two parents but sounds like you have a bratty teen and two babies. Family has to come first especially if one parent is struggling. \n\nCan you get help from other family? So he can go on this weekend and then another weekend ?

It is what it is.", "NTA.\n\nWhen you have a new baby, especially coupled with a toddler, sacrifices have to be made as a parent to account for this new responsibility. His role as a parent takes precedent over a bachelor party. I have a feeling he\u2019d be upset if the roles were reversed, because taking care of two young kids alone is understandably a huge task. The distance of the party from you and the kids would be concerning for me as well; what if there was an emergency?! \n\nPlus: if most of his friends are very much single, there will be more bachelor parties your husband can attend in the future anyway!", "NTA i would end my relationship if my partner went to a strip club, let alone leaving me to take care of our newborn child and toddler by myself. you can\u2019t make him not go, but you can certainly set boundaries and/or leave if he does.", "NTA\n\nTime and place for everything. You've got a toddler and a newborn and need all the help you can get. You both need a break, sure, but you need one before he does.

Still time for those when the kids are older and you can have babysitters if you have lots of friends still yet to walk the aisle.", "Anyone from your family or his available to stay with you to help with the kids while he\u2019s gone? Is it about having the help or is it about not trusting him with strippers and endless Booze? Both valid concerns.", "NTA. I'd maybe say otherwise if you weren't taking care of an infant, but your husband seems selfish. I don't have kids, but I don't think I would even ask my partner to do that. I'd just turn down the invite. Then again, staring at naked women and getting horribly hungover isn't fun for me anymore.", "NTA if he didn't want the responsibilities of parenthood, he should have made different choices. Three months is pretty early to leave when you're struggling to nurse and have a mobile toddler to take care of. However, I hope you two can have a getaway for yourselves soon, as you both need that.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being a bit selfish.  Moms have a tough job.  Dads should support and take over when Mom is worn out from taking care of the kids.  Going away for a weekend is not a huge priority (unless it's with the rest of the family, but I digress).", "NTA\n\nDrinking and watching strippers is more important to him that helping his wife and spending time with his kids?", "NTA i'd seriously reconsider if this is the man you want to live the rest of your life with.", "I love you girl! Been there so many times. Hang in there. We went to counseling and in it my husband I agreed that I get 4 weekends away a year ALONE! I book an air bnb 1-3 hours from home with a bathtub, bring my art stuff, books and sewing machine and enjoy me time. It\u2019s been a lifesaver. And though I could go see friends or party, this alone down time I cherish.  Try and advocate for some self care, being a full time mom is THE HARDEST job ever, and you get no recognition.  And most of the time everyone is always telling you what you\u2019re doing wrong, telling you how easy it is\u2026 when you\u2019ve sacrificed everything to raise kids.  Hang in there! You\u2019re NTA at all. And side note- I m not into hubby going to strip clubs so it would\u2019ve been an over my dead body hell no from me", "Have you had time off since having bub? Maybe you could negotiate let him have this weekend and you plan a weekend with your friends and pump some milk if bub will take a bottle I know sometimes they don\u2019t. Even see if you can get a babysitter for the 3 year old and go out for dinner together.", "NTA, you should never have to ask your partner to be a present parent. It is not some thing that he should be doing as a favour to you, but it\u2019s something that he showed himself feel responsible about. \nYour anger and reaction is absolutely justified. I think you should either write a letter or sit him down and give him a verbatim of what your 24 hrs look like and ask him how he thinks this is doable for a whole weekend. \nI\u2019m sorry you are in a stressful position at this time and point in your motherhood, you deserve better.", "girl after looking at your profile i would question this relationship if i were you.", "What's the fun in being drunk with strippers on your face? That's just disgusting if you're married.", "NTA\n\n  \nThere is plenty he could do with his old friends that doesn't include a ton of half naked women.", "Soft ESH.\nI get being upset, but you\u2019re both entitled to breaks. Denying that sucks.\n\nLet him have this and tell you want to book a girls night away in X weeks/months as a trade for this. He sucks because he didn\u2019t offer up compromises, just complaints. Not ok.\n\nDue to my husbands job and other factors, I pull the most parenting weight. It is hard. But that resentment will kill the relationship quickly, so find an outlet.", "NAH. It would be tough taking care of two children while he's away having fun. But having fun is healthy, and you should start planning a fun night or two off for yourself soon! Pump some milk, and take off. It's easy to see why you're not on board with the situation but you both deserve to still be people outside of your marriage and children.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I commented with the hopes that husband is supportive, loving, and perfectly willing and capable to take on baby duty so his wife can take a break. I didn't want to immediately assume husband bad, husband leaves 95% of child duty to the wife while he does his own thing. Unfortunately, your post history makes it sound like he has a pattern of putting himself first. Tbh, you might as well let him go because it sounds like you should start getting used to the idea that you're a single parent. He's not going to wake up one day and suddenly be the equal partner you need him to be.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou both deserve time to yourselves every once in a while. \n\nAs a new mother, breastfeeding a 2 month old, I can say I\u2019m coming from a similar place. I tell my boyfriend all the time to go spend time with his friends. He tells me the same. I know it\u2019s harder for us breastfeeding, so maybe you\u2019re feeling a little bitter (and I get it) but you have options - pumping, formula, etc, if you\u2019ll be away for more than 4 hours. \n\nPlease take time for yourself and let him do the same. I know this may be an unpopular take because of the nature of the event he wants to attend - but you\u2019re relationship and parenting will be better if neither of you are feeling bitter or trapped.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m editing to add a few things so no one has to read all my responses unless they want to. I knew this would be downvoted a lot, and that\u2019s okay because this is just my opinion based on one post. I do not believe in the misery loves company relationship. I think that if you\u2019re unhappy you shouldn\u2019t stop your partner from having fun. I think sometimes one person does pull more weight, but this should all be discussed and balanced (of course it can\u2019t always be equal) in some way. Not doing so can build resentment and bitterness in a relationship and I\u2019ve seen it so many times. I don\u2019t think that parenting means you never get time away from your children again. I believe this husband, if it was important, should have figured out a compromise and gotten her help if he cared enough for her. I think they are both deserving of time away, help, and fun. \n\nNow, someone commented that if I check her other posts, that he frequently lacks in parenting - goes away, games, drinks, etc. My original opinion still stands based solely on this post. However, of course if he is already enjoying himself frequently and lacking in his parental duties it would change my opinion and rating - but none of that was included in the post and I didn\u2019t do any deep diving into this persons history. To me, this post then just comes off as a vent piece and not really wanting to know if she\u2019s an Ass hole. You already know you\u2019re not at an asshole for not wanting him to go away if he\u2019s always an inadequate partner. Get a marriage counselor.", "Yta only for the comment it\u2019s his 3 month old no it\u2019s both of yours", "YTA\n\nThe tone of your post leaves little to the imagination. You are tired, and tired of being tired. You\u2019ve been in the trenches for a few years and probably haven\u2019t slept a single good night in 4 months.  However, the gist of your argument is: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have fun, neither can you, yeah!\u201d and that is pretty thin. I\u2019d take what you are saying more seriously if you actually objected to him being around strippers. Is that the case?", "Kinda yta. I have been there and I know that it is exhausting. But taking a stance of \"No one gets to have fun right now because I'm not\" just pits you and he against each other. If your issue  is the strippers then be honest and tell him it's about that. If it's about the lack of help then have a conversation about maybe a family member coming to stay. But if you have a marriage where he only gets to do things that you are doing with him you are likely on the short road to an eventual divorce", "As a single person that I am...

If things are really getting out of hand then OP needs to go to marriage counseling and not come to Reddit air all her marriage drama.

It\u2019s not right to only agree with one person because they are the same sex, gender, or ethnicity as you since many people tend to do this. I may not have had a child, but it does not mean I don\u2019t empathize with females when they say they are having are hard time with their children. Trust me I get it, I\u2019ve seen it and I have lived through it and it\u2019s not easy, and I have had my fair share of helping raise kids just as when I helped my brother and his spouse when they needed me when they were new parents 4 times over, including one miscarriage. OP is not giving us a full story just a shortened story of what\u2019s going on. If I had more details about their home life and marriage then I could add more but I don\u2019t and I\u2019m just giving my opinion on the situation at hand. Just because guys are having a bachelor party weekend doesn\u2019t mean all the guys are going to be on their worst possible behavior, we have no right to say that as we don\u2019t know them and don\u2019t know what kind of stuff they are going to do. Imagine it this way, what if OP was the one going away on a bachelorette weekend and her husband had to stay at home with the kids. Every single one of you would be saying she\u2019s NTA and that she deserves the break and he\u2019s just getting a taste of what it\u2019s like to be a mom, etc, etc, etc,\u2026I do know that if OP and her husband love and trust each other then it should not be a problem and they can compromise that she can have her own kid free getaway or something so that she can relax while he takes over for her. It\u2019s not fair to prevent someone from doing something because you can\u2019t do so  and that\u2019s what OP is really complaining about. My military comment was basically saying that if my mom and so many other moms can handle dealing with the kids for a longer period of time then she can handle her kids for a shorter amount of time by herself, especially since she is going to be a parent for ever, it doesn\u2019t stop, ever. If OP has others in her life that can help her if she is really struggling then she can and should ask for help, not come to Reddit for advice. This may also be the perfect time to start teaching the toddler how to help with things in a safe manner while mom is supervising the toddler such as \u2018 hey let\u2019s make PB and J sandwich together or hey let\u2019s separate laundry\u2019 or anything  else the toddler can do since the toddler may be cable of doing a lot by this time but again I don\u2019t know since we don\u2019t have a full story. OP if you are reading this just find a way to compromise with your husband and don\u2019t be so uptight and strict with each other, marriage and being parents is not easy and there\u2019s always going to be something new to challenge the both of you that I know you can work on together.", "Whether or not I have kids is not the point as I\u2019m sure many other post here are by people in the same boat. I am still allowed to have an opinion and that was what OP asked for. If she only wanted other moms to give their opinion then she should\u2019ve stated that but that\u2019s not written down anywhere. I can and do have empathy and I know what moms and expectant moms go through, which is a lot so I understand she\u2019s tired and needs help and I get that she wants her husband there to help instead of going always for a weekend but again I don\u2019t know the full story of their home life so I say she should let him go and find compromise else where. I\u2019m not going to be bullied to say she\u2019s NTA. It\u2019s not a red flag from what I see and if OP couldn\u2019t see red flags before she entered into a marriage and had kids with her husband then that\u2019s her problem and it ours. \n\n1. He can also do this at home on the internet so there\u2019s no stopping that.\n\n2. It\u2019s not her first go around with a newborn\u2026yes new things happen with every child because not every child is there same but that\u2019s what you have to expect with every child. \n\n3.

No problem at all. \n\nI resented my partner for a long time. I used to go to about 4 social events a year, I'd have to inform her a month in advance and she'd give a lot of grief over  that month so I'd be filled with guilt for going and have a bad time because I knew I'd be coming back to an argument. I never once did this to her.\n\nAfter many years of trying to get this point across and a separation period we finally got this right. My partner says have a good time and gives me no grief about going to the occasional social event I go to. I come home earlier and have a better time because I actually look forward to going home rather than putting off returning to an argument.\n\nThe comments on here are so concerning.

The other thing with a baby this young (really, any age baby though) is that they will often fall asleep while feeding, and if you move them from their comfy spot on mom, they will wake up and wail. In the early days, sometimes literally all you do is just sit there and nurse because the baby needs to eat, it takes 45 minutes to do it, they fall asleep on you, you choose to enjoy some silence so you just let them sleep on you rather than wake them up and have to address the screaming, and then before you\u2019ve even finished an episode of a show they wake up and you have to feed again.

Probably because mom smoked during his pregnancy but who knows for sure. \n\nThen she got pregnant with her 3rd  about 4 months ago, and just had to have a forced induction because of defects that won't make the fetus viable. \n\nThey have such bad credit they can't get anything. A bankruptcy that's nearly 7 years old now. Car insurance has to be paid upfront in full, barely get a cell phone, don't even qualify for a car loan. Can't get any utilities in their names anymore. \n\nLike they well and truly just didn't give a single fuck about any of their responsibilities for years and years. It was always sonone else to bail them out. \n\n They would call his parents or my parents and be like \" hey I'm being evicted tomorrow, and the powers shut off, and our car got repo'd yesterday,  the $2000 credit card we got 6 months ago maxed out and didn't make a single payment on. They are after us.  The car insurance hasn't been paid,  same with my cellphone.   \n\nSo they would message you this shit from Facebook Messenger or whatever.

She doesn\u2019t want to give the kid formula so she can get time away from the baby, she just wants support (emotional, household, childcare for the older child) while she stays *with* her baby.\n\nThat\u2019s not even getting into the pumping/engorgement issues others have said.", "Formula is expensive and in rural places can still be in short supply.

He had much more of a relationship with her this way than he would have, and they are very close now. \n\nHe also freed me up to be there for our daughter more, so there was less push/pull between our daughter\u2019s needs and my other responsibilities and needs. \n\nIt sounds like your parents blame your \u201cyou-ness\u201d for how overwhelmed your mother was.
