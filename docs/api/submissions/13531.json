Somehow I doubt it given that you have a 3 month old who depends on you for food.", "NTA - First off, your new baby is only 3 months old and you have a 3yo as well.  He needs to be a father first.  If your baby was older and sleeping through the night he might have more of an argument, but leaving you alone with two children that young when you are exhausted and won't be able to get a decent sleep is just plain irresponsible and dangerous.  Secondly, if you're uncomfortable with him being around strippers, he needs to respect your feelings and your marriage.  He can visit with his friends some other time.  He could take the new husband-to-be out to dinner and give him all the advice on what being a married man is about...like not drooling over strippers while your wife is breastfeeding your newborn baby.\n\nYes, it's important that you both get a little down time.  But that doesn't involve being a 6hr drive away.  How would he feel if one of the kids got seriously injured and he couldn't get home because he was too drunk to drive and 6 hours away even if he was sober.  It's just a bad idea.", "NTA. it\u2019s going to be exhausting for sure so I get where you\u2019re coming from. If he goes to the bachelor party you should be able to get a little break too.", "NTA.\n\nTaking care of your kids and helping out your wife is more important than getting drunk and watching strippers. If he wants to go out can't he do something more local with his friends?", "NTA - there should be two parents but sounds like you have a bratty teen and two babies. Family has to come first especially if one parent is struggling. \n\nCan you get help from other family? So he can go on this weekend and then another weekend ?

His role as a parent takes precedent over a bachelor party. I have a feeling he\u2019d be upset if the roles were reversed, because taking care of two young kids alone is understandably a huge task. The distance of the party from you and the kids would be concerning for me as well; what if there was an emergency?! \n\nPlus: if most of his friends are very much single, there will be more bachelor parties your husband can attend in the future anyway!", "NTA i would end my relationship if my partner went to a strip club, let alone leaving me to take care of our newborn child and toddler by myself. you can\u2019t make him not go, but you can certainly set boundaries and/or leave if he does.", "NTA\n\nTime and place for everything.

It is not some thing that he should be doing as a favour to you, but it\u2019s something that he showed himself feel responsible about. \nYour anger and reaction is absolutely justified. I think you should either write a letter or sit him down and give him a verbatim of what your 24 hrs look like and ask him how he thinks this is doable for a whole weekend. \nI\u2019m sorry you are in a stressful position at this time and point in your motherhood, you deserve better.", "girl after looking at your profile i would question this relationship if i were you.", "What's the fun in being drunk with strippers on your face?

Not ok.\n\nDue to my husbands job and other factors, I pull the most parenting weight. It is hard. But that resentment will kill the relationship quickly, so find an outlet.", "NAH. It would be tough taking care of two children while he's away having fun. But having fun is healthy, and you should start planning a fun night or two off for yourself soon!

I know it\u2019s harder for us breastfeeding, so maybe you\u2019re feeling a little bitter (and I get it) but you have options - pumping, formula, etc, if you\u2019ll be away for more than 4 hours. \n\nPlease take time for yourself and let him do the same. I know this may be an unpopular take because of the nature of the event he wants to attend - but you\u2019re relationship and parenting will be better if neither of you are feeling bitter or trapped.", "Yta only for the comment it\u2019s his 3 month old no it\u2019s both of yours", "YTA\n\nThe tone of your post leaves little to the imagination. You are tired, and tired of being tired. You\u2019ve been in the trenches for a few years and probably haven\u2019t slept a single good night in 4 months.

But taking a stance of \"No one gets to have fun right now because I'm not\" just pits you and he against each other. If your issue  is the strippers then be honest and tell him it's about that. If it's about the lack of help then have a conversation about maybe a family member coming to stay.

It\u2019s not right to only agree with one person because they are the same sex, gender, or ethnicity as you since many people tend to do this. I may not have had a child, but it does not mean I don\u2019t empathize with females when they say they are having are hard time with their children. Trust me I get it, I\u2019ve seen it and I have lived through it and it\u2019s not easy, and I have had my fair share of helping raise kids just as when I helped my brother and his spouse when they needed me when they were new parents 4 times over, including one miscarriage. OP is not giving us a full story just a shortened story of what\u2019s going on. If I had more details about their home life and marriage then I could add more but I don\u2019t and I\u2019m just giving my opinion on the situation at hand. Just because guys are having a bachelor party weekend doesn\u2019t mean all the guys are going to be on their worst possible behavior, we have no right to say that as we don\u2019t know them and don\u2019t know what kind of stuff they are going to do.

Every single one of you would be saying she\u2019s NTA and that she deserves the break and he\u2019s just getting a taste of what it\u2019s like to be a mom, etc, etc, etc,\u2026I do know that if OP and her husband love and trust each other then it should not be a problem and they can compromise that she can have her own kid free getaway or something so that she can relax while he takes over for her. It\u2019s not fair to prevent someone from doing something because you can\u2019t do so  and that\u2019s what OP is really complaining about. My military comment was basically saying that if my mom and so many other moms can handle dealing with the kids for a longer period of time then she can handle her kids for a shorter amount of time by herself, especially since she is going to be a parent for ever, it doesn\u2019t stop, ever. If OP has others in her life that can help her if she is really struggling then she can and should ask for help, not come to Reddit for advice. This may also be the perfect time to start teaching the toddler how to help with things in a safe manner while mom is supervising the toddler such as \u2018 hey let\u2019s make PB and J sandwich together or hey let\u2019s separate laundry\u2019 or anything  else the toddler can do since the toddler may be cable of doing a lot by this time but again I don\u2019t know since we don\u2019t have a full story. OP if you are reading this just find a way to compromise with your husband and don\u2019t be so uptight and strict with each other, marriage and being parents is not easy and there\u2019s always going to be something new to challenge the both of you that I know you can work on together.", "Whether or not I have kids is not the point as I\u2019m sure many other post here are by people in the same boat. I am still allowed to have an opinion and that was what OP asked for. If she only wanted other moms to give their opinion then she should\u2019ve stated that but that\u2019s not written down anywhere. I can and do have empathy and I know what moms and expectant moms go through, which is a lot so I understand she\u2019s tired and needs help and I get that she wants her husband there to help instead of going always for a weekend but again I don\u2019t know the full story of their home life so I say she should let him go and find compromise else where. I\u2019m not going to be bullied to say she\u2019s NTA.

No problem at all. \n\nI resented my partner for a long time.

I never once did this to her.\n\nAfter many years of trying to get this point across and a separation period we finally got this right.

Are you the husband or something?", "and you are assuming there arent. highly doubt you know better. There are 2 children rn no one should leave the other alone. Even if he offered for her to go she couldnt, she is breastfeeding.", "It\u2019s worse when there\u2019s a baby. Especially because he doesn\u2019t have anything to take a vacation from. He sits on his ass and does PS5. \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah that\u2019s all a bit different from lounging around with strippers dangling their knockers in his face isn\u2019t it?", "Having the other parent around is still helpful, even if the baby won't take anything other than Mom.\n\nThe other parent can prepare meals, clean, change diapers, watch the baby while Mom takes a shower or a nap. When Baby falls asleep on Mom and she's trapped, the other parent can get things for her so she doesn't wake the baby by having to get up. Get Mom something to eat and drink! Get her a blanket! Also, it's very frustrating being alone with a baby for a long time and having no adult conversation.\n\nIf Dad wants to go away for the weekend, then someone else has to be there to help Mom during that time. And Mom has to be able to get some time to herself too. As someone else here suggested, a massage or facial or pedicure would be fine if she can't get away for a weekend. Or she could go out with a friend for a couple of hours, catch a movie, have a meal, whatever. Just something that let's her decompress and feel like a human being again.", "I do believe what she\u2019s trying to say is even if baby would take a bottle, breast milk or formula, the mother would still have to pump to avoid pain, amongst other things. I went five hours without pumping after I had my first and my breasts were rock hard, leaking and aching sooo bad by the time I got back to my pump", "An exclusively breast fed baby sometimes won\u2019t take formula and some may have allergies to that formula. There is so much they don\u2019t tell you before you become a mother/parent. You learn it all as you go. Also, even if you have kids from the same parents, they all grow and develop and prefer different things. It\u2019s not as simple as most would think.", "You had a newborn who went 4-5 hours between breast feedings? Even my 6 month olds didn\u2019t do that. It wasn\u2019t until they were in solid food that they could go 2-3 hours without nursing.", "where can i find some hunks for hire? asking for myself", "I totally get that. My husband is not typically super involved with the day-to-day stuff because of his work schedule, but is certainly capable of stepping in when needed and can handle them on his own when he has to. And I grew up with an awesome dad who more than held up his end of the parenting responsibilities, so the \"dads are inherently useless\" narrative annoys me too. It both dismisses capable dads, like you, and makes a convenient excuse for the shitty ones.", "> But going for the memorial versus making a fun vacation out of it with extended days for breweries and beach relaxing...\n\nWhy are you trying to pretend that he didn't take an extended beach holiday as part of that trip? She straight up says she had no problem with him going to the memorial, but he extended the trip to go and do other things that clearly weren't grieving.", "She had no issue when it was planned, she left it until right before. \n\nAs a parent I have learned to preplan everything, as you need to be able to ensure the other parent had all the information in advance to work around you being there. \n\nAnd that goes for all parents regardless of gender.", "Haha what? Just because you say something in a public forum doesn\u2019t mean other people\u2019s unsolicited opinions suddenly count.\n\nMonogamy has everything to do with it. If you don\u2019t get it that\u2019s your problem, and I honestly couldn\u2019t care less what style of relationships you choose, so I don\u2019t care to explain what should be a simple concept to you.", "You've just advised her to leave her partner! \n\nTo literally be alone with her kids for longer than the weekend he'll be with his mates.", "It's 1 weekend, that's hardly abandoning them for long periods, geez. How do you think single parents get by? By getting help from family and friends, responsibility is getting someone to look after the kids so you can look after yourself and be at your best. No one wants a depressed, burnt out parent. She needs to have fun and relax, too.", "Judging by her other posts I don't think this is likely to happen. Her husband doesn't seem to be involved in their kids daily lives enough to be trusted to care for them alone, or to be trusted to offer to do so or be willing to do so.\n\nAnd honestly 4 hours of \"relaxing\" is nowhere near equal to a whole weekend away. Even if she pumped enough to take 2 whole days away. It doesn't seem like her husband is responsible enough to be trusted to take care of a newborn and a toddler alone. And she'd still have to pump every 3-4 hours in order to not be in pain. \n\nThis just isn't the time for him to be taking weekend trips away and leaving her alone. They can plan a strip club trip next year, after the baby is no longer BF, that they can go on together and get a baby sitter lol. Sacrifices are made with kids, especially new borns. Her body isn't even fully healed yet. Leaving her alone, right now, would be something an irresponsible father and husband would do.", "it\u2019s harmless and they both need a break. I find the advice of taking turns and enlisting their support system to be more sensible than sulking", "I\u2019m definitely not arguing that, it\u2019s the simple notion that not everyone is built the same. Expecting everyone to respond the same, is confirmation bias. \n\nMy dad can\u2019t cook for shit, so imagine being my father and trying but being told that the food is gross or seeing your wife not eat because what you made is gross.\n\nYou also misunderstood or didn\u2019t fully grasp what I said.\n\nMy mom didn\u2019t get naps, unless I was touching her. So it doesn\u2019t matter what dad did, he could take me for a drive, but do you wanna go for a drive with a toddler screaming bloody murder and crying the entire time? Fuck no you don\u2019t. Much less screaming bloody murder that mom isn\u2019t touching him. \n\nAs a mother do you want to know that your child is literally CRYING AND BEGGING for mom, because she is in the shower, and ALL you have to do, is set me in a bouncy chair next to the shower and I\u2019m good? Then why would dad bother helping at all. \n\nEvery point you\u2019re making, is the points my mom tried ti make, but fully admitted it was wrong of her, because it was my traumatizing to me, than it was to just give me what I wanted. The baby counselors and all agreed, even the doctor expressed that if that\u2019s what I want then I should be given that. \n\nSo now, again, what is my dad supposed to do? \u201cHey babe go to work I got this\u201d when he KNOWS that he won\u2019t got this, when mom knows he won\u2019t got this? \n\n\u201cHey babe, take care of the kid, I\u2019m gonna take care of us\u201d that was the most logical, and sound decision. Sure my moms feelings were hurt at the time, but even she\u2019s fully admitted that it was the smart decision. My dad isn\u2019t a cuddly or coddle you guy. \n\nCompletely ironically, if you feel my dad wasn\u2019t a good partner then why during the divorce did both my sister and I fully agree that we didn\u2019t want to see our mom at all, and wanted our dad to have full custody and take care of us? I can tell you why, both my sister and I agreed that my mom, long term, alone, couldn\u2019t take care of both of us. \n\nShe was struggling to feed us, she was struggling to cloth us, she was struggling to even make it to our ball games and practices, to where if I was going to moms after I had to catch a ride several times, where my dad showed up to every single practice and game. He watched both of us, for 2-3 sports, practice and never missed a game. All while providing 3-4 deer, 3-5 turkeys, an elk, and several pounds of catfish each year, gave up several of his dreams, sacrificing so much of the things he really wants to get done in his life, for mh sister and I. \n\nArgue all you want about how it wasn\u2019t fair that he didn\u2019t help my mom raising specifically me as an infant, but one could argue it wasn\u2019t fair that he sold a lot his shit, well over $150,000 in the late 90s early 2000s, shit my mom had zero financial help in him getting. Stuff he had before the marriage. She got to keep all her stuff, but he sold his stuff to make ends meet. Argue that it wasn\u2019t fair my dad fed my sister and I later in life, while my mom refused to make child support payments and took my dad to court over it, and WON saying she couldn\u2019t pay child support because she needed the money to support the kids that she wasn\u2019t even raising. \n\nPeople are different, have different personalities, different views, different outlooks, and you should really understand your partner. Otherwise issues will arise. My mom, super emotional. My dad, super logical with no fucks to feelings. My step mom adores my dad and loves that he can ground her. Different people, need different things, due to different personalities. I think my parents should have evaluated themselves more, before adopting my sister and I.", "One of my sister's kids refused breast feeding, the next absolutely refused the bottle. Maybe he would have taken it eventually but there's only so many hours of screaming you can take, considering my sister was able to breast feed. Probably a kid won't starve to death if they have to be bottle fed... But sometimes it's a far cry from \"you can just bottle feed them\".", "I see, the comments read to me like she doesn\u2019t want to have to take all her pumping stuff with her, that\u2019s what I thought she meant by it, pain as in annoyance. But I could be reading it wrong. \n\nI dunno though, I\u2019d rather have a bit of pain and some free time for my sanity rather than being constantly stuck in a house being milked like a cow for hours at a time lmao but that\u2019s why I moved to bottle feeding mine earlier on.", "More than aware, but how will she know if she doesn\u2019t try? If bottle feeding is a way that allowed her to regain a bit of herself and have some free time so she doesn\u2019t burn out and lose her shit, then it\u2019s worth looking into.", "No, I just googled the answer and that\u2019s what popped up lol", "I myself had/have a shit useless non involved farther so know what a shit dad is like, I literally strive to be so much better than him.\nI'll be leaving work in 1hr having been here for 22 hrs, 2 runs to the school, shopping and housework and that's probably less than 50% of the work load but I do it out of love for my little family. \n\nHaving now read her other posts, this man is just like my father and she would be better off without. Best thing mine did was fuck off.", "I honestly couldn't imagine what it would be like to be in a relationship so suffocating that spending a few days a year with my family was considered wrong.\n\nWhy are these people procreating even?", "How do you know she had no issues when it was planned? That is a major assumption to base anything off of. She could have told him to fuck off the moment he mentioned it to her.\n\nAlso let\u2019s say for the sake of your argument she did agree before, she has had a a baby since then and shit changes when you have a kid. The things your partner might have been ok with they might now not be ok with. That\u2019s basic communication skills.", "If you share an opinion online, people can and will react to it. \n\nJust because people don't agree with you, it doesn't mean that 'ThEiR OpiNiOn DoEsN't CoUnt'", "You have issues. There is no mention of the guy wanting to fuck anyone. I never said my opinion counted, and I don\u2019t care about your life. I\u2019ll stand by my opinion, because you sound like a bitter old woman who has to use a leash instead of trust. \n\nHave a nice life, as it affects me in no fucking way.", "If he prioritises a weekend-long party while his partner is drowning at home, and asked him not to go, she's better off without him. Being alone is easier when you don't have someone dissapointing you over and over.", "Yes. But when you have an infant, you suck it up. Those times will come back, but the baby's needs and your family's needs come first for a while, when your kids are this young, and when your partner is struggling. You won't die from missing a drunken weekend because you have more important jobs to do. \nA weekend IS a long time, if you're the parent stuck at home alone with everything, when you needed your partners support and care, but they left to party.\nSingle parents don't have help at all times, but she might be better of learning to manage on her own, without being let down and dissapointed again and again.", "Well actually no it isn\u2019t really harmless when she\u2019s obviously at the end of her tether caring for a toddler and a new baby 24/7 and he wants to go off and get wrecked. I can absolutely guarantee you she won\u2019t be getting an entire weekend to herself to sit around drinking and getting lap dances from oiled up strangers any time soon. Time to yourself is reasonable. An entire weekend when your partner\u2019s mental health is obviously suffering isn\u2019t.", "We don't know OP's stance on strippers. Some partners set a hard boundary at interaction with sex workers; they consider it a form of cheating (I'm making zero comment on whether I agree or not, but that *is* how some people see it, and they're entitled to that view).\n\nIt may not be harmless, regardless of any other factor; because OP may not view strippers as harmless.", "Even if a baby wont take a bottle now, you can freeze the milk (it lasts up to 12 months froze) and use it later, when the kiddo is older and will totally take a sippy cup.", "Omg yesss the pain is intense. I went out for 2 hours the other night and didn't fully drain before hand. I couldn't even enjoy myself. Wound up getting a clogged duct.  Shows me for trying to go out for dinner. I'd rather not have a clogged duct and a wet t shirt out in public.  I'm at the 3 month mark rn and my supply is also increasing so I have to pump and feed her what honestly feels like constantly. Heck I'm scrolling rn b/c I just finished feeding her at 4 am. Every 2 hours on the dot with this one. I would become a puddle if I didn't have my husband to help. He goes out once a week to play music and he works all day before hand, those are the days I think I can't make it. Him being far away for multiple days wouldn't work for me rn.  Definitely in a few months but I'm not confident enough in this role to be alone yet. NTA", "[On average, they will eat every 3 to 4 hours. However, breastfed infants may need to eat more frequently at the beginning of this stage because breast milk is digested more quickly than formula.\"](https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-should-an-infant-eat-when-they-are-3-6-months-old-5186150)\n\nMy kids all ate a lot more frequently as a breastfed baby. Science may have changed but when I was breastfeeding I was taught breast milk is easier to digest and goes through babies quicker, hence needing to eat more often. Also, at 3 months they probably are going through a growth spurt and they are eating more so that your body can adjust to their growing needs.", "If you can't imagine not leaving your heavily pregnant wife alone and with another young child while you go and lie on the beach and go to breweries for a week, please don't have kids. That is a totally normal and reasonable expectation. His own father told him not to go and to stay with his family.", "Cheating isn\u2019t just fucking. You sound super pressed and making loads of assumptions just because someone doesn\u2019t agree with you.", "I would leave her with help, obviously.  But maybe this is a money thing after all.\n\nMy kids and wife are all happy and healthy, thanks very much, but like I said, I consider being cut off from all existing relationships to be a massive red flag.\n\nThen again, maybe there's no real good options here.\n\nToo rich to live in a multi-generational household that proves support and family care.  Too poor to hire help.\n\nA muddled middle breeding ground of insanity all around.", "Again\u2026. Whatever you say. \n\nYou\u2019re sounding kind of pressed yourself. I did have a nice life. You can\u2019t shut up. Who\u2019s pressed??\ud83d\ude02\n\nCan\u2019t take judgement about something you posted, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t post.", "There's a difference between an abuser cutting off someone from their support network, and not going to the beach because you have parental responsibilities. not everyone can outsource every responsibility they have."]}
