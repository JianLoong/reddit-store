But you can communicate clearly that if he does, he is crossing a serious line in your relationship and crossing your boundaries. If he still goes, he is showing you where his priorities lie. Then you get to decide how you move forward with your life after he has made that clear to you.", "NTA. Are you getting a \"once in a lifetime\" break too? Somehow I doubt it given that you have a 3 month old who depends on you for food.", "NTA - First off, your new baby is only 3 months old and you have a 3yo as well.  He needs to be a father first.  If your baby was older and sleeping through the night he might have more of an argument, but leaving you alone with two children that young when you are exhausted and won't be able to get a decent sleep is just plain irresponsible and dangerous.  Secondly, if you're uncomfortable with him being around strippers, he needs to respect your feelings and your marriage.  He can visit with his friends some other time.  He could take the new husband-to-be out to dinner and give him all the advice on what being a married man is about...like not drooling over strippers while your wife is breastfeeding your newborn baby.\n\nYes, it's important that you both get a little down time.  But that doesn't involve being a 6hr drive away.  How would he feel if one of the kids got seriously injured and he couldn't get home because he was too drunk to drive and 6 hours away even if he was sober.  It's just a bad idea.", "NTA. it\u2019s going to be exhausting for sure so I get where you\u2019re coming from. If he goes to the bachelor party you should be able to get a little break too.", "NTA.\n\nTaking care of your kids and helping out your wife is more important than getting drunk and watching strippers. If he wants to go out can't he do something more local with his friends?", "NTA - there should be two parents but sounds like you have a bratty teen and two babies. Family has to come first especially if one parent is struggling. \n\nCan you get help from other family? So he can go on this weekend and then another weekend ? He\u2019s not really offering up any support or other options.", "NTA. Kids complicate life and sometimes get in the way of fun times. And kids don\u2019t get made by just one person. It is what it is.", "NTA.\n\nWhen you have a new baby, especially coupled with a toddler, sacrifices have to be made as a parent to account for this new responsibility. His role as a parent takes precedent over a bachelor party. I have a feeling he\u2019d be upset if the roles were reversed, because taking care of two young kids alone is understandably a huge task. The distance of the party from you and the kids would be concerning for me as well; what if there was an emergency?! \n\nPlus: if most of his friends are very much single, there will be more bachelor parties your husband can attend in the future anyway!", "NTA i would end my relationship if my partner went to a strip club, let alone leaving me to take care of our newborn child and toddler by myself. you can\u2019t make him not go, but you can certainly set boundaries and/or leave if he does.", "NTA\n\nTime and place for everything. You've got a toddler and a newborn and need all the help you can get. You both need a break, sure, but you need one before he does. Especially if you're breastfeeding. \n\nDad needs to step up and be a parent right now. Go to the wedding, skip the bach party. Still time for those when the kids are older and you can have babysitters if you have lots of friends still yet to walk the aisle.", "Anyone from your family or his available to stay with you to help with the kids while he\u2019s gone? Is it able the help or is it about not trusting him with strippers and endless Booze? Both valid concerns.", "NTA. I'd maybe say otherwise if you weren't taking care of an infant, but your husband seems selfish. I don't have kids, but I don't think I would even ask my partner to do that. I'd just turn down the invite. Then again, staring at naked women and getting horribly hungover isn't fun for me anymore.", "NTA if he didn't want the responsibilities of parenthood, he should have made different choices. Three months is pretty early to leave when you're struggling to nurse and have a mobile toddler to take care of. However, I hope you two can have a getaway for yourselves soon, as you both need that.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being a bit selfish.  Moms have a tough job.  Dads should support and take over when Mom is worn out from taking care of the kids.  Going away for a weekend is not a huge priority (unless it's with the rest of the family, but I digress).", "NTA\n\nDrinking and watching strippers is more important to him that helping his wife and spending time with his kids?", "NTA i'd seriously reconsider if this is the man you want to live the rest of your life with.", "I love you girl! Been there so many times. Hang in there. We went to counseling and in it my husband I agreed that I get 4 weekends away a year ALONE! I book an air bnb 1-3 hours from home with a bathtub, bring my art stuff, books and sewing machine and enjoy me time. It\u2019s been a lifesaver. And though I could go see friends or party, this alone down time I cherish.  Try and advocate for some self care, being a full time mom is THE HARDEST job ever, and you get no recognition.  And most of the time everyone is always telling you what you\u2019re doing wrong, telling you how easy it is\u2026 when you\u2019ve sacrificed everything to raise kids.  Hang in there! You\u2019re NTA at all. And side note- I m not into hubby going to strip clubs so it would\u2019ve been an over my dead body hell no from me", "Have you had time off since having bub? Maybe you could negotiate let him have this weekend and you plan a weekend with your friends and pump some milk if bub will take a bottle I know sometimes they don\u2019t. Even see if you can get a babysitter for the 3 year old and go out for dinner together.", "NTA, you should never have to ask your partner to be a present parent. It is not some thing that he should be doing as a favour to you, but it\u2019s something that he showed himself feel responsible about. \nYour anger and reaction is absolutely justified. I think you should either write a letter or sit him down and give him a verbatim of what your 24 hrs look like and ask him how he thinks this is doable for a whole weekend. \nI\u2019m sorry you are in a stressful position at this time and point in your motherhood, you deserve better.", "girl after looking at your profile i would question this relationship if i were you.", "What's the fun in being drunk with strippers on your face? That's just disgusting if you're married.", "NTA\n\n  \nThere is plenty he could do with his old friends that doesn't include a ton of half naked women.", "Soft ESH.\nI get being upset, but you\u2019re both entitled to breaks. Denying that sucks.\n\nLet him have this and tell you want to book a girls night away in X weeks/months as a trade for this. He sucks because he didn\u2019t offer up compromises, just complaints. Not ok.\n\nDue to my husbands job and other factors, I pull the most parenting weight. It is hard. But that resentment will kill the relationship quickly, so find an outlet.", "NAH. It would be tough taking care of two children while he's away having fun. But having fun is healthy, and you should start planning a fun night or two off for yourself soon! Pump some milk, and take off. It's easy to see why you're not on board with the situation but you both deserve to still be people outside of your marriage and children.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou both deserve time to yourselves every once in a while. \n\nAs a new mother, breastfeeding a 2 month old, I can say I\u2019m coming from a similar place. I tell my boyfriend all the time to go spend time with his friends. He tells me the same. I know it\u2019s harder for us breastfeeding, so maybe you\u2019re feeling a little bitter (and I get it) but you have options - pumping, formula, etc, if you\u2019ll be away for more than 4 hours. \n\nPlease take time for yourself and let him do the same. I know this may be an unpopular take because of the nature of the event he wants to attend - but you\u2019re relationship and parenting will be better if neither of you are feeling bitter or trapped.", "Yta only for the comment it\u2019s his 3 month old no it\u2019s both of yours", "YTA\n\nThe tone of your post leaves little to the imagination. You are tired, and tired of being tired. You\u2019ve been in the trenches for a few years and probably haven\u2019t slept a single good night in 4 months.  However, the gist of your argument is: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have fun, neither can you, yeah!\u201d and that is pretty thin. I\u2019d take what you are saying more seriously if you actually objected to him being around strippers. Is that the case?", "Kinda yta. I have been there and I know that it is exhausting. But taking a stance of \"No one gets to have fun right now because I'm not\" just pits you and he against each other. If your issue  is the strippers then be honest and tell him it's about that. If it's about the lack of help then have a conversation about maybe a family member coming to stay. But if you have a marriage where he only gets to do things that you are doing with him you are likely on the short road to an eventual divorce", "As a single person that I am... I would be hating you too cause its not like he sees his colleges friends always or they get married always. The kids will be there 3 days after. Id hire you a nanny for 3 days and go... \n\nBut on the other side I dont have a gremlin sucking my tits all day...", "YTA it's a bachelor party. I'm 100% sure that you will, at some point, be invited to a party. Just because you're struggling doesn't mean you need to make him suffer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There middle ground here? I just did 6 days in Orlando, my wife stayed home with our three month old but her parents also stayed with her for the week.

Navigating parenting is difficult - and I can\u2019t imagine with multiple children.. but maybe there\u2019s a compromise - and maybe if both of them had some time to do things on their own, bigger events wouldn\u2019t be so important to attend.", "I\u2019m not projecting, I hope for the best for this family and I don\u2019t think either of them should \u201csuck it\u201d. \n\nIt is so not easy.

That is the compromise.", "Parenting is hard and you have to lean on your partner and take when your partner gives. Everyone needs to blow off steam for a few days.", "Is that the definition of a compromise? Good to know.\n\nHowever, the reality is - there are so many options to make this work. Maybe they can get a friend or family member to stay with her the weekend to help? Maybe he could pay for a baby sitter to stay with her during the day with the toddler so she\u2019s less overwhelmed?\n \nOP\u2019s feelings and frustration are valid and I empathize with her completely.
