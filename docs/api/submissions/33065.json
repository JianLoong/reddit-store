I\u2019m stating this because it\u2019s relevant to the story.\n\nThere was a team leader at the restaurant who we had recently promoted at the time. She had worked there for about year at the time and we never had problems with her until one day, I was looking at the sales on the screen and I had seen multiple meals throughout the day costing 0 dollars. Normally I wouldn\u2019t think too much of a couple free meals, but the problem was that there was multiple meals from the same order ticket and the price was 0 dollars. Seeing that she was the only team leader there at the time, which means that only me and her had manager IDS, I went up to her and asked her did she give the customer a free order with her manager ID. She said that they needed a remake since we messed up their order last time. I said ok but it didn\u2019t explain the other free meals. I decided to put it on the side since I was busy at the time. \n\nWell an hour later I was in the office balancing drawers and I peered on the cameras to see her giving a free meal to another customer. And that customer who looked like he was getting ready to pay until she came up to him. Seeing as I\u2019m the manager I went outside and asked him what happened, and he told me that nothing happened, and that the lady randomly told him it was on the house. At this point I knew exactly what she was doing and it wasn\u2019t going to work. I called her into the office and asked her if she was doing what I thought she was and she confessed and said \u201cwe gotta stick together over here\u201d. She expected me to understand since I\u2019m black too, but this is wrong on so many levels. She abused her manager ID and lost sales for the company plus we live in a fairly conservative state, so if they found out that this was happening at the restaurant, we\u2019d get torn up by lawsuits.

She was also opening up your restaurant to lawsuits based on discrimination.", "NTA. The point of the matter is that she was giving away food, who to isn\u2019t important.

She's probably been stealing from the till too.", "You are ALL correct. You should have given a second chance, you DID give a second chance, and she stole from the company again, exposing that she also lied. \n\nUnfortunately, you did the right thing.

If she had given free meals to needy people, regardless of their skin colour, it would have been different.

But i cant see how youd be subject to a lawsuit", "You did what the company wants, you work for them not for your relatives. The team leader could've come to you to ask, but acted on her own, so she needs to take the blame. Being a manager is tough sometimes but you seem to have a good eye for things. Maybe put into place an agreed policy, and get staff to run things by you and not act alone", "It is generally considered theft.\n\n\n\nAlso, it sounds like she lied to you about the first incident you caught.", "NTA\n\nAlso, you're definitely management material if you can call the hard shots like that. \n\nShe's basically a racist thief.", "Hm. American work culture is a lot more brutal than in my home, so I do not know if what you did is expected or normal. So no comment on this, I do not know what tools and guidelines you have.\n\nBut something had definitly to be done, some form of reprimand? So NTA in general. Maybe someone from the US can better judge if what you did was too far or not.", "INFO: does your company not have any set policy for giving critical feedback and allowing the employee to attempt to do better?", "She stole from the company.

He forgot a question, she committed theft repeatedly. Don\u2019t sugar coat it. It was theft. You made the right call.", "NTA,  the racial discrimination isn't the biggest issue here. It's the fact she was stealing from the company by abusing her privileges as a team lead", "You\u2019re NTA. She was stealing from the company, no matter how charitable her intentions were. \nThose who think you acted too quickly and should have given her a second chance, remind them that this young lady did it repeatedly, lied about what she was doing when initially questioned, and then was presented with evidence when she repeated the act before she admitted she was doing it. It was deliberate and she introduced race to justify her misdeeds. \nYou did the right thing.", "NTA. I understand that her heart might have been in a good place, but you're right about the possibility of lawsuits. She not only was risking getting you and her fired, she was risking everyone's job if they decided to shutter that location in order to pay the damages.", "YTA for being such a company stooge. This company does not give a fuck about you and would fire you tomorrow if your car broke down and you missed a shift.", "YTA. You are not going to inherit the company.\n\nIn Spain we had a similar case lately. A popular tiktoker spoke about how she gave extra whipped cream, let people go to the bathrooms without spending and giving extra discounts on a chain caf\u00e9 (not the american one). She did that for 5\u20ac/h. She ended up being fired in a similar manner when the thing blow out and HR showed her video of giving extra stamps on a discount stamp pamphlet. It went viral and the Streissand effect got her a job at a Representation Agency. \n\nThat guy she gave her the free burger, when able to get his own, would no doubt get back and buy his meals at your restaurant. You lost a good employee, and plenty of customers because he'll get back with money, but won't stay when he notices she's gone.\n\nIf you see someone stealing from a big chain, while the boss gets tax cuts by getting the benefits  to fiscal paradises, you either look the other way, or burn the bosses house. \n\nThe news of the Spanish case:\n\nhttps://www.20minutos.es/noticia/5191704/0/despiden-carmen-merina-camarera-que-se-hizo-viral-denunciar-sus-condiciones-laborales-si-alguien-me-quiere-contratar/", "NTA she is and sounds like an entitled zoomer", "YTA because of you a decent human beeing lost her Job.", "She not only had a chance to come clean, but she had a chance to stop with no repercussions.  If you steal something while you know you've been caught recently, even if you got away the first time, you have to be pretty stupid to try to steal again from the same location on the same day.  Fool me once...", "Heart of gold for stealing? Idk bro especially since it was racially motivated imagine a white person did this y'all would lose your mind... I agree the biggest problem is then lying about it after she got caught then doing it again she knew it was wrong so yikes", "How is it noble?  It would be noble if a person clearly looked homeless or didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for the food but to give free food because of the color of their skin is not noble.   If you reversed the color to white would\u2019ve you said the sane thing.  \n\nThis person is a thief and liar so nothing noble about that.", "It's not unlikely that this level of dishonestly would be an automatic firing offense anyway.", "Theft is normally gross misconduct and instant dismissal.", "The company will definitely give a fuck about the both of them if a lawsuit comes up.", "And that company could also fire OP if he knew about the theft and did nothing about it.", "Theft is theft bro in America we actually punish people that do that ... We don't know how long she was doing it until homie caught her in the act so", "No a thief lost their job. She\u2019d be decent if she gave free meals to those in need.  \n\nWhen you work for a company you. Any just give things away and expect consequences.  If the skin color was different I bet your reaction would be too.", "If you want to operate under the notion that the restaurant deserves to be exploited, I\u2019m game.\n\nIn that case, a decent human being would give free meals to everyone, not just their own race.", "How is a racist thief a decent human being ?", "And if OP did nothing and corporate found out, he would loose his job along with her, genius", "Please read the whole sentence, not just 3 words of it. Or heck, read the whole comment.\n\nI used the phrase \u201cheart of gold\u201d because that\u2019s the reason OP and his family are questioning the firing.

Here it is theft as well, and as I commented, the lady in the caf\u00e9 got booted. But who are they robbing tho? I'd feel robbed working for 5\u20ac/h or the minimum wage while others get bonuses in the millions. I'm a human person first, second an employee. So I'd do the humane thing before the corporate thing first.", "Stealing from a thief is not theft.\n\nWe are talking about systematic exploitation of workers.\n\nBut yeah how could I forgot that Ronald McDonald has to pay His Yacht.", "I they found out what? How will they prove that He knew whats happend?

Racist assholes stealing food from the company they work for don't have hearts of gold. I get what you're both saying, it's just the difference between agreeing on principle or not.", "I read your whole comment giving someone a free meal just because they're black isn't having a heart of gold it's just giving away free things to black people because she's black lol again if she was white you wouldn't have said that if she was only giving food for free to whites... That's theft and to me if it was a homeless guy it would be different as you pointed out she lied and knew it was wrong. Either way to me her intentions weren't necessarily good because only one type of customer benefited if the story is different I'd agree more, but I strongly disagree just on that point alone", ">It\u2019s a common phrase used to describe someone who means well but is misplaced in their actions.\n\nIve never seen Heart of Gold mean that nor does any of the google results im finding for that phrase....", "Well, she is only justifying her bad behavior. \n\nShe is a thief and a racist.", "And the human thing to do would be to punish someone who decides to steal .... If you wanna get paid more don't work at some cafe that pays like crap? But i see what you mean I just don't really agree because she gets paid bad it's ok she did that? No justification needed I agree to an extent, but ultimately if you're in a shit job it's your fault.", "I\u2019m out of time so I can\u2019t teach English to another person on here. \n\n\u201cThe employee was a thief and a racist\u201d I AGREE with this statement.", "I agree that's the only problem I have with it if the race was different the reaction would be totally different. Treat everyone the same theft is theft! Hope I wasn't rude tho dude!", "No-it\u2019s not about the disagreeing on the principle, because I never said she actually has a heart of gold. I said she \u201cMAY have a heart of gold\u201d, and I fully acknowledged (in the same comment) that she was actually in the wrong.\n\nWe agree on the principle, you just want to pick out a few words and act like you know what I said.", "I don\u2019t think you understand the term \u201cheart of gold\u201d.", "Here are some selections for you\u2026\n\nLanguagehumanities.org\n \u201cIt is also used to indicate a contrast between a person's appearance and behavior by suggesting that the individual has a good heart underneath an exterior that suggests otherwise.\u201d\n\nNosweatShakespeare.com (Shakespeare is who first used the term) \n\u201cDescribing someone as having a heart of gold, meaning that they are a good, kind, generous person, isn\u2019t always without shades in its meaning. It is more usually used as an excuse for something less pure.\u201d\n\nThe phrase is also idiomatic, so it\u2019s meaning is dependent on context, which is why the rest of my original comment provides the relevance and context in which the phrase is being used.", "I agree with THIS even if you don\u2019t like how I phrased it. I know I phrased it correctly for what I wanted to say. \n\nYou think \u201cheart of gold\u201d is positive. I think \u201cheart of gold\u201d is negative disguised as positive. I\u2019m good to agree to disagree on this at least.", "I don't think you understand that having a heart of gold means doing things for someone for the right reason the intent wasn't there so you adding the phrase heart of gold makes no sense but I'll be the adult here and just say agree to disagree because to me she got what she deserved and to me she wasn't doing anything right at all", "It means that the person likes to help for the sake of helping. By extension, it also means that the person is in the wrong.\n\nSo a person with a \u201cheart of gold\u201d frequently \u201cgives\u201d when giving isn\u2019t needed or right to do.", "Oh God you just can't let it die can you \ud83e\udd23 again still only halfway there buddy I'm done wasting my time"]}
