It\u2019s not recommended to put clean dishes in a dishwasher. You are supposed to scrape off any food particles larger than a grain of rise then put them in the dishwasher. Also, regardless, you should be cleaning your dishwasher and the filters every few months or so. She is wrong, it is wasteful and her method actually decreases the lifespan of the dishwasher. \n\nIt\u2019s insane to have such a fight over something that is both easy to look up and overall really not a huge deal. Her defensiveness over this is childish at best but to give you the silent treatment for days after is kind of unhinged.", "NTA because it sounds like she has an anger problem. It's a waste of water, energy, money, and time to wash them before using the dishwasher. Why doesn't she just wait until the dishes have been thru the dishwasher and then clean any that might not be clean enough?", "NTA\n\nThat's absolute nonsense. Why have a dishwasher and not use it? Yes you don't want large chunks of food in a dishwasher but it has filters to catch small ones?", "NTA but this isn\u2019t a hill to die on. If she wants the dishes washed 2x and she isn\u2019t expecting you to wash them 2x as well, let it go.", "NTA. This is a pet peeve of mine. If you have an electric dishwasher, you should just scrape and rinse off the dishes before putting them to wash in the dishwasher. \n\nWhat a waste of her valuable time to wash the darn dishes before using the dish washer. Just calmly ask her *why* she thinks she needs to so thoroughly wash them. Maybe it was habit, and now you\u2019ve backed her into a defensive corner. \n\nThat said, you\u2019re right.", "NTA. Her way of washing dishes is indeed wasteful and unnecessary. Maybe your way of talking about this with her could have been nicer - but she reacted with insults and the silent treatment which is emotionally abusive behavior, so you're in the clear here. I hope your discussions are usually more civil and she hasn't made a habit out of treating you like this.", "NTA. She's an idiot and it wastes water. \n\nThat said, nothing ends relationships more than resentment over household chores. So maybe just get rid of the dishwasher.", "Definitely not. And, there are actual studies out there showing that rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher is unnecessary. But washing them once then washing them again just in case? In case of what? I wonder what your wife is afraid of that she's doing both. Or maybe she's a bit OCD. But, doing both IS a waste of resources (it's just the truth) and makes no sense. It's curious that your wife is now giving you the silent treatment. Interesting choice on her part, and it would be valuable to figure out why she does this. I suspect this is a pattern of hers. I'm also thinking your wife has issues admitting when she's made a mistake because getting defensive is indicative of that. Just go and talk to her about the whole thing because her doing the double washing just doesn't make sense, so there is something else going on underneath it all. NTA", "NTA. Experts say that dishes shouldn't be too clean because the sensor in the dish washer thinks the dishes are cleaner that they might be and then up washing the dishes less that they should have been.", "NTA and tell your girlfriend that in order to work properly all modern dishwasher tablets require some food residue to work", "NTA - if you're washing the dishes till they are spotless, then they don't need to go in the dishwasher and waste your electricity. If you want to use the dishwasher, just run stuff under the tap to hose off bits of food first. \n\nI hate dishwashers, though. They never clean as well as I do, and I got fed up of having to basically clean everything twice because the machine sucked.", "You can google this and show her that modern dishwashers and their detergents are specifically designed for \"dirty\" dishes and as long as you are scraping excess food off of the plates (and with cheaper dishwashers you'll have to presoak those with burned on food) and she is, infact, wasting time and energy/water by prewashing the dishes. \n\nNAH you're wife is just uninformed (or maybe has some OCD issues?)", "NTA\n\nYou're right and she seems to have a combined pride-and-anger problem.", "NTA. You are literally correct, it is costing extra money (not to mention using extra water and possibly electricity depending on your water source).", "Absolutely NTA and this is an area of contention for me and my wife as well.  I've actually read several things that recommend NOT rinsing your dishes, like this:\n[https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/home-improvement/should-you-prerinse-dishes/](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/home-improvement/should-you-prerinse-dishes/)", "[deleted]", "So imagine.  You don\u2019t clean the gunk off the dishes, glasses and stuff.  Turn the dishwasher on it fills with water and soap, then is goes around and around.  Drains and fills back up with water.   However, all the food and crud does not go down the drain, it stops at the filter, so now the supposedly clean rinse water has food particles all through it.   \n\nI wash off the dishes so there is no food on them and treat the dishwasher more like the sanitizer wash.   Keep in mind too that the caustic dish washer soap will scratch and dull the finishes on glasses and plates", "OH come on now, hurting your wallet?  That's where you dug deep for that one and she is striking back.\n\nWhy are you guys letting something SO SMALL get in the way?\n\nIf you don't want to have to pre-wash dishes, buy a BOSCH.  They're amazing.\n\n....   So...  You could do a little investigation with the manufacturer/seller of the dishwasher and find out just what is needed.  I would expect rinsing dishes, and wiping off things that have hardened onto the dish.  With a bosch, I think you only need to give a rinse (and some don't even do that much.)  Bosch's are amazing.  Had one once.  \n\nWhere did you get the idea that the dishes don't need to be pre-rinsed and in some cases pre-washed? (I dont' mean washed really, I mean water wiped with a dishrag)...  Did you grow up with your parents owning a BOSCH?  I'm really not even kidding here.\n\nI had the old GE or Whirlpool dishwashers and was like, why does my mom's dishes hardly even need to be wiped/rinsed before washing?  It's because it was a BOSCH and they are amazing.\n\nSo I bought a BOSCH.  Yep.  amazing.  Expensive.  It died because we self-installed it and it needed some sort of electrical buffer so that when the power fails for example, that it is protected.  Not installing it properly concerning the electric plug buffer thingie - meant that it got fried eventually.  Have to wire the new electronic appliances correctly so that they have the proper buffer in place, I can't remember what it's called.  \n\nNow our dishwasher is plugged into something special that protects it that way.\n\nOK Back to the wifey, why are you guys fighting?  Think of your vows.   If you would do those things in your vows for her, why wouldn't you pre-wash dishes?\n\nAlso, is she having control issues, or is she just tired of dirty dishes coming out of the dishwasher?    I mean she's not your mother and doesn't need to tell you what to do with the dishes.  Neither of you should parent the other - that is a marriage wrecker.  She's parenting you with telling you how to prewash the dishes and you're parenting her telling her about money wasting...  Come on you guys...  \n\nI suggest a little fun.\n\nFIRST check the manual for how you're supposed to do the dishes with this thing.\n\nYou guys agree to something like, if you wash the dishes your way and she can't tell the difference, then you're free to do the dishes as you please.  If the dishes come out with crud on them or fingerprints, you'll do them her way.  BUT if the dishes come out FINE your way (and according to the manual), she needs to let go of expecting YOU to do the extra steps.  Let her do what she wants personally though.\n\nOK - whoever is right, buys dinner for the other.  GO ON A DATE.  The winner picks the place.\n\nTURN this into fun you two.  \n\np.s.  Doing the dishes her way causes the dishwasher to be more of a sanitizer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or find a detergent that is less effective lol.", "You are correct. Dishwasher soap is meant to remove gunk. You are supposed to leave a bit of residue on plates to get them to wash correctly.
