I was young and didn\u2019t fight her on custody and when he got older we weren\u2019t close so I felt awkward asking him to live with us. She tried to prevent us from communicating and moved around a lot so it was always hard to spend any time with him until he got his own phone. But now I have spent more time with him and now we are close. \n\nMy second wife is hard working and very financially successful as an engineer. In fact she makes more than me. Our daughter takes after her, she is a straight A student and is going to be back in school to be a nursing practitioner soon. \n\nMy wife is angry with me because my daughter and I aren\u2019t close. She goes to her mom for everything and doesn\u2019t speak to me much. We were close when she was young but since high school it\u2019s like she pretends I don\u2019t exist. I try to reach out but it\u2019s met with silence. I think my wife poisoned her against me because I have spent most of my money on my son. My wife told my daughter I didn\u2019t pay for an cent of college for her and my wife did all the saving for her college fund. \n\nI didn\u2019t really contribute to my daughter\u2019s college fund.I didn\u2019t pay for any piano lessons etc. I did pay for half of the family expenses with my wife like the mortgage but my extra money has been going to my son. Partly child support but I\u2019ve also been contributing outside of that. He didn\u2019t finish school with good enough grades for college. I gave him money to upgrade his grades and helped him get a place to start college. He got 2 semesters in and then left because he was depressed. He has a lot of issues from growing up with his mother and I feel partly responsible because I didn\u2019t try to fight for custody. I give him money for rent and he has issues holding down a job so he needs support. \n\nMy daughter recently reached out with an schedule for her and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding. It had his and mom\u2019s dance but not the father daughter one. I was confused and asked my daughter about that and she replied \u201cwe aren\u2019t close enough for that\u201d. I was shocked and asked her why she would consider us not close and she said \u201cwell you basically disinherited me\u201d. I called her and asked her to explain and she said because her mom paid for college and will be helping her with her NP degree and I didn\u2019t give a crap about her after middle school because of my son. I explained everything I said above to her(and she knew most of it before that as well).She said I should have split my funds and time between them. I told her I felt like I did and she got angry and said I didn\u2019t and it\u2019s like she was raised by a single mom and that\u2019s why she is uncomfortable with having a wedding dance with me because it would be a lie.\n\nI felt like I was fair to them, I lived with my daughter I just didn\u2019t pay for things outside of food, mortgage, utilities etc. that\u2019s because I felt like my wife had it covered and my son was getting nothing. My ex wife wasn\u2019t saving anything and I wanted to help him because he was having a much harder time than my daughter who had an attentive mother. But she felt I was prioritizing my son and in her words \u201cdisinherited her\u201d. I feel like she should understand the situation but she didn\u2019t want me to be included in the wedding much at all.", "created_utc": 1697497934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179jpz6/aita_for_disinheriting_my_daughter/", "score": 301, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Use your brain and it's pretty obvious", "More Info - are you divorced from your 2nd wife too?\n\nRegardless, YTA - you admit that you spent most of your money on your son, but you also throw in a line where your daughter accuses you of not splitting your \"money and **time**.\"  Seems like you left out details about how you failed your daughter.  It sounds like she has plenty of reason to not feel close to you.", "YTA, and you sound like an all around shitty parent to both your kids.  \n\nYou let your son stay with a drug using Mom and didn't pay attention to your daughter.  Why are you surprised she does not want to be around you?", "YTA. You didn't disinherit your daughter, you neglected her in an effort to save your son. You failed both. Apologize to both. Vow to be better and do it. You have a lot to make right with your daughter, and it will take a long time. Your son needs support in getting professional help, not just paying his rent.", "YTA.  Poor little OP, nothing's ever your fault, is it?   You didn't father your son because of the evil ex (and you didn't fight for custody, even though you paid child support) and you didn't father your daughter because you spent all your time and money on your son?\n\nAnd your wife \"poisoned\" your daughter by telling her the truth?  And somehow this was enough to trump all the actual parenting... because you were still a fully involved parent, right?  Right?\n\nSomehow it's all the women's fault that you didn't raise either of your kids.  Sure.", "YTA. From the get go. \n\nYou let your son be raised by a drug addict. Why the fuck didn\u2019t you fight for custody? So crappy parenting from the start. Doesn\u2019t surprise me that it carried over to the second. \n\nYou claim you did do that (in terms of splitting time and money), yet everything you wrote clearly shows you didn\u2019t. So just stop with the lying. \n\nYou yourself said that you paid for half of the family expenses but none of the extras. So no, you didn\u2019t do shit. And your daughter is absolutely right. \n\nWhy the fuck weren\u2019t you putting money into a college fund for her or helping pay for piano lesson? \n\nAnd now you pretend to be surprised when she says you\u2019re not close?\n\nOh ffs. Grow up. You sucked with kid number one, and it continued with kid number 2.", "INFO\n\n> My first wife had drug problems and still got primary custody of our son. I was young and didn\u2019t fight her on custody\n\nWhy the shit did you not fight to keep your child away from someone with a drug problem?\n\nWTF does being young have to do with anything?", "I know you meant well, but YTA. You fell into the very common, but still unacceptable, trap of ignoring the child you think didn\u2019t need you (at least not like your son) and overcompensating with the child you perceive as needing more.\n\nIf you can manage a sincere apology and work on yourself through therapy, maybe your daughter will come around. Your end goal, however, should be to realize your mistakes and be better, not corral her into the relationship you want. She doesn\u2019t owe you that.", "YTA.  I have a feeling your wife has been telling you how she and your daughter feel for years. And you ignored it. I see why you did what you did, maybe it was the correct thing even, but you don\u2019t just ignore a festering resentment like this.  You needed to work this out with your wife, marriage counseling or even divorce, and continually communicate with your daughter.  \n\nI think that if you\u2019d involved anyone else in your plans you might even have come up with a better solution, for both your kids.", "I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that you and your daughter probably weren\u2019t that close prior to middle school either, she was just too young to realize that her dad wasn\u2019t all that interested or involved.  \n\nI know you didn\u2019t pay for her activities but how many of them did you attend?  Not just the recitals or big events but the every day stuff?  How many times were you the one taking her to doctor\u2019s appointments or helping her navigate situations with her friends?  If she feels like she was raised by a single parent it goes deeper than you not paying for college.\n\nYou have a lot of excuses why you weren\u2019t involved with your son and now you\u2019re using him as an excuse for why you couldn\u2019t be involved with your daughter. Have you considered that maybe you\u2019re just kind of a shitty parent?  Also, YTA", "YTA\n\nYou managed to be an absent parent while living in the same house. Impressive. \n\nYou failed both children. You abandoned your son with a drug addict then tried to make up for it by neglecting your daughter in favor of your son.\n\nETA: OP was 22 when his son was born. He is using the fact that he was young as an excuse. I would have assumed he was 16 based on the spin he put in it. 22 is old enough to put on your big boy pants and be a parent.", "YTA- to BOTH of your children. YOU CHOSE not to fight for your son when he was a child and as a result his life was crappy.  YOU CHOSE to ignore your daughter because you finally decided to be a father to a son you never cared about.  You are a massive TA and deserve everything your daughter said. Count yourself lucky she is CHOOSING to allow you to come to her wedding. She'd be well within her rights to ignore you the way you keep CHOOSING to ignore her", "Why should she treat you like a parent when you\u2019ve never acted like one to her? You were a roommate, Her moms husband. You don\u2019t get to be mad at her now for the role you chose to play in her life. YTA", "what's the relationship between your son and your daughter like?", "YTA . She grew up and realized that daddy spends all his time with his other kid. You neglected your daughter and now you\u2019re suffering from it . Nobody\u2019s fault but yours", "YTA. You had two children but only \u201chelped out\u201d one you thought deserved it more because of your guilty conscience. To not contribute anything to your daughter except the minimum it\u2019s almost like she was on minimum child support while your son got everything extra. Honestly I\u2019m surprised your wife is still with you.", "YTA.\n\nYour reason for only supporting your son doesn't matter, you had the exact same obligation to your daughter.\n\nYou did what many parents do, you failed one child and, in your attempts to fix that failure you fail your other child.\n\n>I told her I felt like I did \n\nDon't lie, it just makes you a bigger AH.\n\n>I lived with my daughter I just didn\u2019t pay for things outside of food, mortgage, utilities etc. that\u2019s because I felt like my wife had it covered and my son was getting nothing.\n\nSo, you admit you didn't, it doesn't matter that you daughter mother could provide her more, YOUR obligation was the same.\n\n>I feel like she should understand the situation but she didn\u2019t want me to be included in the wedding much at all.\n\nShe does understand, it's just that you are wrong.", "How is this a question? Is this written by the daughter?  \n  \nEither way, YTA.", "YTA. Your daughter was communicating her feelings, and you're dismissing them while also being defensive. If your daughter doesn't feel like you were an emotionally present father, then you  weren't. Stop trying to force a relationship, and start rebuilding on her terms.", "Your daughter seems to have a fairly accurate grasp of the situation and your priorities. What a shame. YTA.", "I kept having to double check your post that this is your actual biological daughter you're talking about, and not a stepdaughter you aren't related to or legally responsible for.\n\nYTA. You did let your wife raise her as a single mother. She got nothing from you other than a roof over her head and food, which is the absolute legal minimum - and I get the feeling you only covered those because you had to pay for those same things for your own upkeep. Her mother's ability to pay for all of her extracurriculars and provide emotional support didn't absolve you of your parental duties, it only meant even less for your daughter because she had only one parent, not two.\n\nWhy do you want public credit for parenting someone you admit that you didn't have a hand in raising? Why do you feel you should get a dance with her when you admit you put all of your effort and money into your son? You had two biological children, not one. Parenting is about being responsible to all your children, not just the one that's easiest to throw money at.", "YTA\n\nLet me reword this. \"I felt so guilty for earlier mistakes with my son that I made a whole new new set of mistakes with my daughter, who now thinks I don't give a darn about her because I'm doing everything I can for my son and nothing for her. Why does she think I'm a bad father?\"", "I love how you casually slip in that you not only not payed for anything for your daughter, you also spent very little time with her. You clearly favor your son, who you used to neglect, but in trying to make it up to him, you completely disregarded your daughter for years. YTA.", "YTA. Her mom time doesn\u2019t make up for not having dad time. Get a grip!", "YTA she's prioritizing herself and her fiance on their wedding day.  I'm sure she's sure you'll understand the situation", "Your daughter had an attentive mother. That's great, since she has a parent who cares about her. But you can't ignore her needs in favor of your son's and expect her not to feel abandoned.  She works hard and gets no support; he drops out of college, and you pay his rent. It sounds like your time goes to him as well. You have two kids who needed you, but you're trying to make up for abandoning the first by abandoning the second. YTA", "YTA. You don't even see that you made the same mistake twice. As a father you neclected both of your children. Money can't make up for the all the times your son would have needed you growing up and living together didn't save your daughter from feeling like she couldn't rely on you either. I think you would benefit from therapy to talk about the relationship you have with your kids right now. The good thing is your daughter and you were close in the past so there is a foundation to build on. Your son would also benefit from a father who could guide him with more than just financial help to find a more independent path in life.", "Supporting your son is an understandable goal. But pushing your daughter over to her mother like a passed football is not the best way to do it. Daughters need to feel dad is there, you have not been. She started slipping away and you never really tried to find out why, just seemingly shrugged and accepted the convenience of it as allowing you to dedicate your guilt to your other child. Apologies and amendment of behaviour could help... but it could also be that the ship has sadly sailed away. The excuse of 'you were okay and someone else needed me' is not acceptable, SHE needed you.", "I don't understand how a family runs finances where you can identify which parent paid for what for which kid. In families I am familiar with,  kids are a family expense and are funded with family money based on family decisions. Your description of time is also foreign to me.  Did you really not go to your daughter's activities,  drive her and her friends all over the place,  and travel as a family?", "Why are you with your second wife? In a real marriage people share their money. So it\u2019s not his money or her money. The fact your wife has told your daughter it\u2019s only \u201cmy\u201d money that paid for xyz shows that she wanted a wedge between you and your daughter. Maybe you did spend more on your son but when your 2nd wife married you she became his stepmother and she should have been willing to treat him just like her own child. Divorce your wife! I do not think that you can save your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA. How do you not see it? You feel guilty for screwing over your son (because that's exactly what you did), so you think screwing over your daughter in his favor makes up for it?\n\nGuess again. Now she doesn't even love you anymore.", "YTA unintentionally, and so are both your wives are too but more directly.\n\nYou meant well for your son, but ignored your daughter in the process.  Of course your ex made things difficult, and that sucks, but your current wife also made it worse.  By making it obvious she was paying for everything, not \"we're supporting you\" but \"I'm supporting you\" to the daughter she deepened the rift.  Your current wife should have spoken to you about what she was seeing with your daughter far sooner, or maybe she did and you missed it.\n\nEither way, you inadvertently caused this issue, and only time spent could possibly fix it - if your daughter is willing.  The fact you still are favoring your son with basics isn't helping when you're not contributing time, energy, or money towards your daughter.\n\nThe only ones innocent in this are the kids.", "YTA - you managed to be an absentee parent for both of your children, congrats.", "You can stop waiting on that father-daughter dance.  That ain't happening.\n\nBut no, you didn't \"disinherit her.\"  You \"severely neglected her.\"  Semantics are important.\n\nOh, and YTA.", "YTA, Hope your son takes care of you in your old age because you clearly picked your favorite.", "YTA \n\nYou sound really confused like \"that was the situation\" \"wife had it covered\" yeah she had it covered because you didn't. That was the situation because YOU made it the situation. Your daughter shouldn't have to come to you on her own to form a relationship, you are her father, why weren't you doing more? Yeah maybe some teens don't want to be close to one of the parents but you know what those parents don't do? Stop trying. \n\nYou didn't try with her and she noticed. She saw you try with your son. She saw you spend money, emotional needs, attention on your son but never on her. In your mind she didn't want it and had those needs met, and that's exactly why she was raised by a \"single mother.\" You chose not to do those things for her and these are the consequences. \n\nRealize that what choices you made, even though you just thought was just how it was, were still choices. Just like how you made the choice to leave your son with his drug addict mother. In situations you make choices, and by not making a choice because you think it won't help or change things, that is still a choice. \n\nDon't make excuses because in the end they're just flimsy excuses. People see actions as a way to prove words. You weren't there for your daughter, period. For whatever reasoning, you just weren't. Instead of being stuck in the past, think of what you can do to fix the relationship. Because if it was fine like how you thought it was, you wouldn't be in this situation now. Just because it's like this, it doesn't mean your wife poisoned her mind. She's an adult, she has eyes, her own perception. She doesn't need anyone else, not even your wife to tell her that you were an absent father. Even in your own words, in your post to us, we can see that you were not a great father to her, of course you don't have a close relationship and it is of your own doing. Sure you lived together, maybe paid for the food on the table, a roof over your head but you did nothing more than that. And if you think that's all it takes to be a good father, well, lay it out. What did you give your son that was more than that and not give to your daughter? Doesn't matter if one needs more than another in your perspective, they're both your children. And by not making it fair, you favored your son and so your daughter knows she is less compared to her half sibling because that's exactly how you treated them. \n\nYou're trying to argue with people in the comments but realize this is exactly what your daughter feels and we are trying to help you understand. Whatever narrative in your head that made you innocent is not how it seems in the real world, in writing to us or in person to your daughter. You will never form a good relationship with your daughter if you do not attempt to see things from her perspective and take some responsibility for your actions.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re doing things opposite. You should be loving and caring with your daughter and harder on your son. \n\nAlso, why does your wife complain about you not paying for college when she was saving for your daughter college the whole time? Just want to complain. \n\nYour daughter for being a jerk and ungrateful. Is she in a serious relationship by any chance?", "YTA. I bet you haven't contributed to her wedding either. I'm left wondering who is giving her away because I don't think it will be you.", "The train left the station years ago and only now do you notice?", "YTA times infinity.\n\nAnd you paid for your son to \"upgrade his grades\"? What, like a bribe to the school? Paying a hacker? Your daughter is right, you ard not a dad. You are an AH, though.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter had the opposite of what your son got. \n\nShe had an absent and emotionally neglectful father and an attentive mother.", "Oh, so you shared a roof with your daughter that automatically makes you a good father? Nuh. \nIt\u2019s your fault. YTA.", "YTA, you were not a present father to her. You don't get to be shocked when you didn't do anything with her extra curriculas and leaving everything that wasn't a necessity on your wife.", "YTA.  You were an absent father to your daughter whom you lived with.  You didn\u2019t fight for custody for your son.  You shift blame for your crappy parenting in your wife poisoning your daughter\u2019s mind.  She doesn\u2019t need to.  You said your daughter is smart and could see that you weren\u2019t there and doing bare minimum all the while trying to buy your son\u2019s affection.", "YTA. So you pay for basic basic things and call that fair? I don't see a valid reason as to why all of your money goes to the son.", "YTA and in the top 5 of those I've seen here. The only things I don't get it's why your wife is still with you but I think now your daughter is going to be married you are going to be single really soon lol.", "ESH, kind of surprised at all the YTA comments. \n\nIt sounds like you weren\u2019t entirely fair to your daughter and gave majority of your time/money/attention to your son- with that being said though, your first wife took time away from your first child and made it difficult to have a relationship with him and you likely felt you needed to make up for that. Your second wife was extremely immature telling your daughter all these things that would obviously make her feel bitter towards you. Both these women have acted incredibly petty and immature and I\u2019m not going to blame you entirely for not knowing how to navigate this with 100% success rate. \n\nThis stuff is hard. Keep doing your best, and try to make more of an effort contributing and considering your daughter as well as your son - take them out together, contribute to them equally.", "ESH\n\nYour wife, daughter and you all suck for focusing on the money.  You did not disinherit anybody.  You spent more on the child who had different needs.  This happens even with biological siblings.  If one out of three kids needs braces, a tutor, plays an instrument whatever.  It doesn\u2019t sound like the daughter lacked for financial support.  Her and your wife are just now mad it didn\u2019t come from your paycheck.  You need to discuss with your wife, if she didn\u2019t feel you were pulling your full share of your daughter\u2019s expenses she should have discussed your joint family budget with you.  Not complained about it to your daughter.  I\u2019m not sure how bad your relationship is as husband and wife right now but I\u2019d have a deep discussion on budget issues.  Does she think also haven\u2019t done your share towards retirement savings, vacations, other discretionary spending?  If you can find a common ground then together talk to your daughter.  They are poisonings the well when they mix budgeting into resentment about being close.\n\nBUT you also need to talk about the apparent neglect.  If they were ever neglected because you didn\u2019t help them with expenses, understand what they did without.  But it sounds like they never came to you and said \u201cwe need $$$ for band camp\u201d.  So it seems like the neglect is more spending time and paying attention to your daughter.  If she can\u2019t even share a dance at her wedding there are some deep resentments you should try to understand, apologize as appropriate, try to develop a way better adult relationship with her than you had with as a teenager.  You should not have let her set the tone of your relationship as a teenager.  When she stopped talking to you it should have been a priority for both you and your wife.  \n\nIt does sound like as your daughter got older your wife might have used her as her venting partner.  That\u2019s not appropriate to put a child in this position.  You and your wife should seek couples therapy to learn how to function as a couple, not 2 separate households sharing a roof.  If it\u2019s not too late.\n\nDid your guilt make you overspend on your son?  Possibly.  Look at this with your wife.  Do some planning now for your future retirement and if you\u2019re in the position estate planning.  If it\u2019s truly a disproportion, and some of the spending was indeed luxury spending and unnecessary, you have time to adjust whatever is truly \u201cinheritance\u201d money.  With your children fully aware why and it\u2019s dependent on you not needing the money yourself in your old age.\n\nGood luck.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA. As I read a lot of these comments, I get the sense that most people voting YTA are not parents. \n\nI'm 38, have a wonderful spouse who is a really great parent, and we both still struggle to raise our two kids. Those who don't have kids have NO CLUE how difficult it is, and they're not considering the fact that your \"choice\" was to try to fight to be the primary single parent at such a young age. And being a parent at 22 is YOUNG. Commenters make the assumption that just because you're not in high school, that should make you a fit parent, and that you should be making great decisions in life. You know what I was doing at age 22? I was going out, drinking, and clubbing! \n\nNobody is also accounting for the fact that the legal system has historically favored the mother in custody battles, so the best that OP could have hoped for was shared custody. Based on the info he had at the time, there was no way he was going to get full custody. \n\nAs a father myself, I also understand that you can't treat your kids the same. Even if they resent you in the future, some kids just have greater needs. Take an extreme example such as a child with mental illness and another that doesn't. These same commenters would never judge you for treating them differently. They don't get it, and are living in an ideal world - one that they will understand was unrealistic at best once they grow up.", "I\u2019m gonna go with all around ESH here. \n\nIf you did spend more time with your son than your daughter, that\u2019s probably why she leaned on her mom more and can make you an AH. HOWEVER, you paid for mortgage, groceries, etc. around the house, which your son was not receiving from you so you spent money on him as well. I think your daughter is TA for faulting you for not paying for her college and post graduate tuition. It is always a great bonus to have a tuition fund but if you couldn\u2019t afford it, then what the hell is her problem if your wife was able to? \n\nYour wife is the biggest asshole here because she voiced her issues with you to her underage daughter. That is NOT ok. It\u2019s a marriage therefore it should be a joint effort - your wife made the divide between where money is spent pretty clear and I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still with her after this.", "Sounds like you are gonna ruin the relationship with both your kids. You said you are paying your son's rent. Does he work? I wouldn't worry about his education. it sounds like he's not interested. You are making him dependent on you which is not a good idea", "You don\u2019t mention how old your son is. If he\u2019s had two semesters of college, I\u2019d guess over 18. Why are you still paying child support? You know he\u2019s not a full time student. You financial responsibility to him ended when he quit school.\n\nNow, your moral responsibility is something else. You feel guilty so you enable his hobo lifestyle. You\u2019ve basically turned your back on your wife and daughter. You should consider divorcing and moving, by yourself, to a new city/state.

I was young and didn\u2019t fight her on custody and when he got older we weren\u2019t close so I felt awkward asking him to live with us. She tried to prevent us from communicated and moved around a lot so it was always hard to spend any time with him until he got his own phone. But now I have spent more time with him and now we are close. \n\nMy second wife is hard working and very financially successful as an engineer. In fact she makes more than me. Our daughter takes after her, she is a straight A student and is going to be back in school to be a nursing practitioner soon. \n\nMy wife is angry with me because my daughter and I aren\u2019t close. She goes to her mom for everything and doesn\u2019t speak to me much. We were close when she was young but since high school it\u2019s like she pretends I don\u2019t exist. I try to reach out but it\u2019s met with silence. I think my wife poisoned her against me because I have spent most of my money on my son. My wife told my daughter I didn\u2019t pay for an cent of college for her and my wife did all the saving for her college fund. \n\nI didn\u2019t really contribute to my daughter\u2019s college fund.I didn\u2019t pay for any piano lessons etc. I did pay for half of the family expenses with my wife like the mortgage but my extra money has been going to my son. Partly child support but I\u2019ve also been contributing outside of that. He didn\u2019t finish school with good enough grades for college. I gave him money to upgrade his grades and helped him get a place to start college. He got 2 semesters in and then left because he was depressed. He has a lot of issues from growing up with his mother and I feel partly responsible because I didn\u2019t try to fight for custody. I give him money for rent and he has issues holding down a job so he needs support. \n\nMy daughter recently reached out with an schedule for her and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding. It had his and mom\u2019s dance but not the father daughter one. I was confused and asked my daughter about that and she replied \u201cwe aren\u2019t close enough for that\u201d. I was shocked and asked her why she would consider us not close and she said \u201cwell you basically disinherited me\u201d. I called her and asked her to explain and she said because her mom paid for college and will be helping her with her NP degree and I didn\u2019t give a crap about her after middle school because of my son. I explained everything I said above to her and she said I should have split my funds and time between them. I told her I felt like I did and she got angry and said I didn\u2019t and it\u2019s like she was raised by a single mom and that\u2019s why she is uncomfortable with having a wedding dance with me because it would be a lie.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But if she wasn't happy about that, she should have talked to him.\n\nMaybe she did and he didn't listen very well. But taking it to the daughter was wrong. OP may be exagerating the claim of his wife poisoning their daughter against him... but  i doubt it is wholely without merit. There is no reason for OPs wife to give their daughter the details of how the college fund was funded, unless there was already resentment built up. But turning your kid against their other parent is an ugly way to deal with it.\n\nI also think the daughter is included in the ESH. She's been cutting him out of her life since HS. Probably 8 years, possibly more. Did OP maybe spend more time with his son and not enough with her? Possibly.\n\nBut at the same time, once she started to cut him out, it would have become an ugly negative feedback cycle. She's having nothing to do with him, so of course he'd spend time with his son (and generating resentment). She doesn't involve him in an activity, or acknowledge when he does show... and it becomes the reason he's not invited/acknowledged the next time. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. Eventually the cycle goes on long enough that how it started is forgotten and all that's left is the pain.

He went over the top with it, though.", "both your wife and your daughter has always aware of the existence of your son since the beginning?\n\nI will be honest, a lot of children who grew up as an only child will go through a stage of grief, if you will, once they suddenly have a sibling in their life. Because at one point, they didn't have to \"share\" their parents. All the attention and love was on them.\n\nThink of it from her perspective, hmmmm, my friends have a brother and sister to play with, I don't. And in order to deal with that, she comes up with \"oh well, at least both of my parents are MINE only, and I get all the attention and everything\". For some it gets to the point where that thinking becomes rooted as an identity.\n\nEven for full siblings, it is a difficult process. There has even been cases where the older child threw her baby brother out the window of an apartment building out of these negative feelings. But what usually happens is that most older children starts finding joy in having a sibling by their side, and so despite the fact that (as long as it's not too imbalanced) they have to share attention...etc. It feels more than worth it.\n\nBut in your case, she seems have gotten all the negatives of having a sibling, no positives.\n\nThis would be way easier to solve if she's still a child... but she's not anymore. And quite frankly, she's at an age where she's no longer in as much of a need of a father figure compared to before. In other words, you kind of missed your best chances.\n\nHere is what I suggest,\n\n1. do not have expectations of her returning any feelings, your efforts to make things right...etc. Whether or not you choose to put effort in is your choice. Whether or not she accepts is another question that you cannot force things. But do not be discouraged. As long as you've tried your best, she 100% knows, but years of uncertainty and hurt cannot be that easily forgotten. Make sure to be consistent with your effort, and don't take rejections personally.\n2. have a talk with your wife. This is the one person she trusts, and it is very important that you have your wife on your side. You guys are in this together, she is not your enemy. Ask her for advice and how to help, make it clear to her that you guys are in this together, also let her know your boundaries. (i.e. ask her to instead of going to her child telling her that her mother did everything and her father \"disinherited\" her, comfort her, offer her assurance that her father loves her no matter what. And instead, go to her father to discuss these negative feelings to find a solution.)\n3. Make sure to let your daughter know that your love never subtracts, only multiplies. You can invite both of your children over at the same time or go out with both of them, it doesn't always have to be one or the other. I have two younger sisters, the youngest one require more attention from me for obvious reasons. I always tell them that I love them all the same in amount, just in different ways. The older one feels comfortable coming to me when she feels like she needs more from me, and I set up a time to fulfill that need while asking for my grandparents for help with the youngest one during that time.\n4. set up a will (can be something along the lines of wife 50%, daughter 25%, son 25%- whatever you do, make sure that your children get equal amounts) send it over to your children, let them both know that they are both not any less important than the other, and that you feel so lucky so proud to be the father of them.\n\nagain, there is not as much you can do at this point with both children being adults and having their own lives, I do wish you luck. Recognize your shortcomings as a parent (we all have those), it's never too late.", "The financial choices of the parents on which contributing parent is directing money where is not a child's concern.  In a marriage where kids are involved, most have a level of joint funds.  Unless OP refused to pay for his daughters stuff, but more likely it was an arrangement they had based on circumstances and available funds, this issue is only there because the wife made a point of it.\n\nI'm not saying OP is a saint here, far from blameless, but it isn't as if the daughter is going without in favor of the son overall, and it isn't as if dad is wasting money gambling or on something frivolous.  When parents are together it should be a united front of caring for the kid, that's what the wife should have projected, not a \"I'm the only one helping/supporting you.\" and then getting mad that dad and daughter aren't close.", "I think you're overly focused on a small detail and losing sight of the bigger picture.

His comments state that he only knew about weed and cigarettes at the time, and that he also did weed, so that would have been a moot point in court.
