Just bc your parents are still providing you financial assistance, doesn't mean they get veto power over your life choices when they have no repercussions or hurt anyone.\n\nShe's bullying her own child bc she cares more about other people's theoretical opinion than her own relationship with her child. Either she's letting her anxiety rum away with her instead of trying to process it and logically realize that ppl's other opinions won't negatively impact her life or she's trying to emotionally manipulate you into doing what she wants.

(BTW, I'm from the U.S.)\n\nThat was a hard call for me, because this seems less like a morals situation and more like something that is just actions and consequences. Like you got a tattoo knowing that your parents wouldn't like it, but that's your right. Your parents could choose to go nuclear and stop assisting you, but that's within their rights. You could then choose to go nuclear and go no contact, but that's your right. It's really just a chain of possible events.\n\nHowever, after thinking about it, you aren't asking about whether you're an AH for *getting* a tattoo. You're asking if you're an AH for *not covering it up*.\n\nI think maybe dress code rules would be applicable here. Employers and schools can require you to dress a certain way. There are social expectations for what you wear to religious facilities and events, weddings, and funerals.\n\nBut how to apply those expectations to your situation? Well, a landlord would be within their rights to have a dress code *I suppose*, but that would be pretty outrageous. And here's the thing: Employers, schools, etc. don't get to dictate what you wear while away from their facilities and events.\n\nYour mother is worried about what people will think of her, but *you are not an extension of your mother*. You are your own person.\n\nYour mom trying to dictate what you wear outside of her home is where she crosses full on into AH territory. \n\nAll of that said, only you can decide if the battle is worth it. Covering up is objectively a small thing, but how you feel about it is not. Even though I don't agree with it, I do understand your mother's social dread. That's also a feelings thing. Sure, it's easy to say that the opinions of others shouldn't matter, but sometimes they do and sometimes people struggle with being judged by others. You don't care what those people think, and personally I wouldn't either, but I also understand that it's apparently not so easy for your mom.\n\nBut feeling disgusting is no small feeling, and your mom's fears don't automatically outweigh that. Your options aren't just either cover up or don't, there is middle ground to consider. You could carry bandaids, for instance. Then you'd just slap one over the tattoo if you happen to see someone she knows. It would be a bit of a hassle, but it's one potential compromise. \n\nOf course, you are under no obligation to compromise either, especially if it harms your self esteem. As I said, it's up to you to decide if it's worth it. \n\nI feel the need to ask if you have actually told her how it makes you feel like you're some kind of disgusting person when she asks you to cover up? Judging by the fact that she didn't throw you out or stop assisting you, I'm guessing that she does in fact love you, and would not want to make you feel this way. Perhaps she just needs to clearly hear and understand your feelings to be able to focus on coming to terms with her own.\n\nIt's not like your tattoo can be hidden forever. Eventually someone in her circle will find out, regardless of whether or not you try to accommodate her.\n\nFor what it's worth, I have a large, and highly visible tattoo that I wouldn't dream of covering up for anything short of a professional dress code. Maybe for wedding pictures if I like the person who's asking enough. Maybe.

She was super anxious and had an alcoholic for a dad and it made her controlling and this was way before mental health was anywhere near accepted (Think 1940-1960s. My mom was way younger than most of her siblings so she missed most of the fireworks).\n\nAnyway eventually one of my uncles got a tattoo or one of my aunts started dating a guy with a tattoo (I think he was in the navy).I don't remember the story exactly it been a couple years since my mom told me. From what my mom told me it was kinda similar to OP's situation: Grandma pitched a fit, Grandpa was mostly apathetic, but after a bit, things settled down cuz while my grandparents had some toxic beliefs that may have been more common at the time, ultimately, they loved their kids enough to realize it wasn't that important in the grand scheme of things and it's not like the tattoo was going anywhere so they let it go.\n\n When their adult children didn't become human goblins bent on worshiping Satan, they eventually decided it was silly to get upset about in the first place. By the time I was starting college my aunt was getting a tattoo to honor my grandma after a nickname my grandma would call her (it was a type of flower) and when she showed my grandma she loved it. I think she added more after she passed to make it a partial sleeve. \n\nI know OP is at the beginning of this situation and there's no guarantee it will work out as well as our family's did, but I hope OP sees it and takes some kind of comfort from it that things may seem sticky now but that doesn't mean it won't be better eventually.\n\nSometimes to make things better and to break toxic cycles, it means pushing back against people we care about and making them a little uncomfortable sometimes. Sometimes our parents are wrong and sometimes we have to stand up to them. It doesn't sound like OP's Mom is going to throw her on the street so it's not like she's risking homelessness. She's not endangering herself by acting as an independent autonomous adult. Mom learning to either stand up to her gossiping relatives or learning she can't dictate her daughter's choices now that she's an adult is something that is better they both learn now than when OP is older and struggling to stand up to her mother while her mother is trying to control her SO or how she parents her own kids", "If her extended family is that judgemental it\u2019s only a matter of time before something happens that causes their disapproval.", "It\u2019s her body bro, at age 19 a grown woman is supposed to check with mommy if they\u2019re allowed to get a tattoo? \n\nNTA. \n\nOP your mom sounds like me before my son got a tattoo lol\u2026 she needs to realize you\u2019re a different generation and tattoos have gone mainstream. \n\nHer ultimatum is absurd.

Mom, being a bit more practical (and seeing her special coffee creamer disappearing at a much faster rate) would quietly walk by and pick up the cash or put a post-it note on the check for us to make it out to her.  Dad knew she did it - his pride just would not allow him to accept money from his children.  Mom knew how much the grocery bill went up.", "We pay my in laws rent. It's well below market value, however they're not keeping the money. It's going towards the mortgage and a separate savings account for us. The trade off is we handle most of the up keep and give them a call for major things. Like the time our garage opener died and it was 1k and change to get a new one installed. We paid for it up front and in laws paid us back in full.", "I think its - your going to have to pay a lot more to not live in this house a few hundred a month is nothing and gets them ready for the responsibility of monthly bills.", "My mother charged me rent in grad school. But I think it was only after the divorce and loss of my father\u2019s income. She said that I was paying for the raised utilities for living there( I did not pay full market rent). I couldn\u2019t afford market rent! I was offended initially, but it made sense.", "Yes it is, I\u2019ve seen it plenty and I\u2019ve friends all over the US. You reach adulthood and get treated like one-pay rent, pay food, pay for your bills/split bills. It\u2019s really not that uncommon in the US at all.", "No one said they should live as children. But if you\u2019re a fully grown adult with no mental or social issues living at home and not paying rent, I think it\u2019s *extremely* fair to live under the rules of the household. You don\u2019t like it, to get your own place. It\u2019s not your house, it\u2019s not your rules.", "I know plenty of people who pay their parents rent. I know plenty who don\u2019t. Their living situations are understandably far different. Especially cus the ones not paying rent know that it\u2019s not their house, so not their rules. They follow the rules set out by their parents because they recognize it\u2019s not their house", "I paid rent to my family it's not that I didn't mind paying rent it was the fact that they'd double it every month, so that I would move out faster :/.", "I dunno. If you\u2019re responsible for something, you would have a level of control and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy in any way. I understand where you\u2019re coming from but responsible isn\u2019t the right word for it. Care for them, certainly. But responsible for them isn\u2019t great. If they\u2019re adults, they should be responsible for themselves. I would care for and about my kids forever, just like my mom does for me. But I cannot be held responsible for choices that they make as adults (not young adults but by the time they\u2019re 26, I think they should be responsible for themselves and shouldn\u2019t fall back on it\u2019s my parents\u2019 fault thing).", "I\u2019m just talking about language. There\u2019s no definition of \u2018rule\u2019 that limits its meaning in the way the poster above would like. The rule might be unreasonable. It\u2019s just juvenile to suggest \u2018RuLeS dOn\u2019T wOrK liKE tHaT!\u2019\n\nThis is a mother/daughter dispute, nothing more. Mother gets to set \u2018the rule\u2019. Daughter can break it, call it unreasonable, whatever. She then lives with the consequences. Under her mother\u2019s roof.", "So... No source", "Being intoxicated doesn't mean they have to be involved. But she would still be disrespecting them. Respect is earned. Why should they respect her when she does not respect them?", "Respect: \u201cdue regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others\u201d", "I am questioning why OP seems shocked and upset that her mother is acting as her mother said she would. If the entire family was tattooed, and OP got a matching one and the mom went off the deep end, I would be on OP's side. OP was told \"we disapprove of tattoos\" and then is shocked by the disapproval? OP gets to have the tattoo, it is her body and her choice. And, her mom gets to not want to see it.", "Not you, but the person to whose correction you chose to argue with.", "No. It depends on the culture, family and the economic environment. Even in the us, with so much of our culture promoting the dodging of parental responsibility, that\u2019s not a particularly uncommon realization. \n\nOp didn\u2019t rock the boat, her mother did. \n\nDad has disdain for the tattoo. What mom is doing goes way past that.", "I agree any expectation to cover up outside of the home is excessive and controlling.", "Well yeah but you seem pretty privileged no? And also like, do you think other cultures that care more about family interdependence are worse in that regard", "Independent doesn't only mean financially independent. You can be mentally and emotionally independent. Becoming mentally independent from your parents is necessary to be a healthy individual and not co-dependent on them.", "Yes, because this 19 yo should be fully held responsible for the consequences of capitalism. Making all the sense...", "The, like \"you're 18 and not my problem anymore\" way of parenting just makes me feel physically sick, its so mean and such a weirdly impersonal way to treat someone you brought into this world. I don't think parents like that really wanted kids in the first place.", "It just, like, doesn't mean her parents arnt taking it too far and being ridiculous over something harmless. Particularly if she is doing her best to grow and work on herself and does her part around the house. Its just a tattoo. Part of learning to be an adult is finding yourself, they need to respect that she isn't going to be a carbon copy of them and give her room to figure herself out. Express their disapproval, fine, but not speaking to your DAUGHTER for a MONTH!? Life is too short to be that petty with the people you love.", "Responsibility isn't about control. Whoever taught you that it is did you a disservice. Responsible is about doing what is in the best interest of whoever or whatever you are responsible for. And responsibility isn't an either or either. My children are already responsible for themselves. They are responsible for the choices they make and how they affect themselves and others. They are responsible for picking out the clothes they wear and eating enough to make sure they are full. A person can be responsible for themself while others are also responsible for them. An employee is responsible for themself, but their employer is also responsible for them. So yes, adult children are responsible for themselves. A lot more than a child would be. But that doesn't negate the responsibility of the parent. Anymore than the responsibility of the employee negates the responsibility of the employer.", "Is Japan's tattoo issue Yakuza IDs?", "Most likely... because OP said it's summer right now.", "Rules aren't a dictation. They are agreed upon boundaries so everyone in the house is treating everyone else with respect and  decorum. Only authoritarians see rules as something that are unilaterally decided with no input from anyone else. It might work this way with young children cuz they have to be taught how to be a respectful and kind person, but you have to give them more and more autonomy as they get older. OP is legally an adult and she has the proper emotional and intelligence skills to make this decision.\n\nThe problem with authoritarian parents is they always struggle with their children becoming independent adult because while they have taught their kids to respect them, they never learned to respect their kids. They either had authoritarian parents themselves so never learned the skills set needing to cope properly with this or the continue to expect their children as obedient \"mini-me's\" and only are allowed to make their own decisions and beliefs as long as it's exactly what the parent thinks it should be", "As if you could read laws in German, French, Swedish, Dutch or Danish\u2026", "Being intoxicated in someone's home inherently  involves them. You still haven't explained how this disrespects them in any way shape or form", "Yes. And you are using the word to mean \"subjected to abusive control and not complaining\"", "OP doesn't mention her parents warning her, or telling her how they'd react. So there was no ''as her mother said she would''. OP said *she* thought her parents would huff and puff but then get over it.\n\n>thought they\u2019d be a little upset but get over it after a few days.\n\nWhich is what her dad did. She didn't expect her mother to blank her for a damn month, and her mother never gave her any warning that she'd do something like that either.\n\nAnd the issue isn't that her mother disproves of tattoos - her dad disproves of tattoos but he's being civil about it. Her mother's concern is *her own reputation*, because she's worried their bigoted family members will judge her as a ''bad parent''. Not concerned they'd judge OP for having a tattoo, but that they'd judge *OP's mother.*\n\nThe issue isn't her mother not wanting to look at tattoos - it's her mother feeling ashamed at the idea others will think poorly of her, and projecting that shame onto OP to try and protect herself.", "Came here to ask that, if the tattoo was a swastika I would call the mother's reaction warranted.", "Cool that was your experience. I knew 3 people tossed out on their 18th birthday. Let one of them sleep in my car and later couch for a few months so they could finish high school. I graduated in 92. \n\nIt happened very frequently to my generation in the midwest. Nice to know it was not a countrywide thing.  I moved out at 17 myself. It was rough but nowhere near as hard as it would be these days.", "Because in Australia we don't move out of home to go to uni/college, like it seems is very common in the US.", "I live in California & the only housing the average 18 year old can afford is a college form from taking out a student loan! I lived with my mom for a few years after I turned 18. It seems pretty common. More so with the current housing crisis of housing costing so much!", "I would also point out to your mom, that people are going to start talking about you anyway since you are wearing warmer clothes than normal to cover the tattoo. Especially when they know you and know it isn't something that you would normally wear in the hot weather. It will only be things like, \"I wonder what is going on with spare2004? She always looks like she is overheating but she isn't wearing cooler clothing\". The same people she is so worried about talking about your tattoo, will be the same people that will chat over your change in clothing. The longer this goes on, the more shit that will hit the fan when everyone finds out you actually do have a tattoo, because I promise, it will not be hidden forever. I get your mother is worried about all of the snide comments that her friends will say, but maybe she needs to stand up for you or to get better friends. My mom also hates tattoos, but she has told me that if I want one, she will accept it. Your mom is free to fret over every time thing others might think of her and her family, but pushing that onto you is not okay.", "Some of these comments are insane. The tattoo shouldn\u2019t be a huge deal, you shouldn\u2019t need to move out over it.\n\nDefinitely NTA and your mom will get over it eventually.", "I totally agree that the parents \\*shouldn't\\* be telling OP to cover up their tattoo, but they are, and will continue to do so. To whatever extent, grown children living with their parents may need to give up some level of autonomy. If the psychological cost is too high, they may need to look at other options. I understand this choice, because I've had to make it myself.\n\nI don't think OP's the asshole, but a little delusional that getting a huge tattoo while living with conservative parents won't be a big deal. OP may list off cultural and economic reasons for having to live with parents. Those reasons are valid, but they are frankly also reasons why the parents may feel entitled to comment on OP's body. I don't think it's reasonable for OP to take a slice from the middle of the cake of the traditions that they're going to follow.", "You sounds entitled and out of touch.  Yeah it\u2019s your body.  And you can choose to walk it out of your parents house and their rules.", "The tattoo does affect the parents; it is a source of embarrassment for them. \n\nIf there is a housing crisis in your country, then maybe instead appreciate the fact that your parents are so good that they would allow you to still live with them. The least you can do is to stick to the rules that they give you. \n\nNow sure, you can negotiate for some wiggle room, but in the end it is their house and they are well within their right to accept that everyone who chooses to live there, abides by their rules. \n\nYes, the children are adults... But this is what the world of adulting entails.", "Exactly. She pays rent to live in their house; she does not pay rent to live in her body. NTA.", "Agreed, I'm 28, I only moved out of home when I was about 25, and only because I moved in with my partner.\n\nAt 18, there is no way I could have afforded to live on my own, and I've been working since I was 17.\n\nI also get the \"my house, my rules\", but I don't see how this can rationally be used in the context of what someone does with their body.\n\nIt's a tattoo, (granted I'm biased, I am COVERED), my parents were not at all supportive of my getting tattoo, or piercings, but they're rational people, and knew I knew what I was doing, and that ultimately it's MY body, and I have to live with it.\n\nGetting a tattoo isn't grounds to kick your child out, that's abusive and controlling.", "Her parents are still supporting her paying for school and most of her living expenses. Tattoos are expensive. I would be upset that she made a poor financial choice and might rethink my financial support.", "They do not own her body and everybody is saying just that. She is allowed to make her own choices. Mom cannot control her ... outside the house. \n\nThat being said they own the house, they dictate the rules of their house and they can choose who is allowed in their house etc. \n\nThey can decide to ask her to move out based on any reason they see fit. They do not owe her anything at this stage - she is adult and own her body and life now. They do not like her boyfriend, her religion, her ... Fill the blank ... And they are perfectly in right both legally and morally to ask her to move out. \n\nMind that she knew that they disapprove so she knew the consequences. \n\nThose indeed are 2 separate concepts - but it simple means both are legally and morally allowed to do and feel what they want", "My first thought was that OP should post a lovely picture of her new tattoo on Facebook. No need to cover it up if everybody knows. Then again I'm stressed and feeling petty, lol.", "Okay, any marginal understanding I had for your mom is completely gone hahaha still a resounding NTA", "Kids are a giant responsibility and a lot of irresponsible people have them.

Nothing will stop me from being covered and I\u2019m in a profession that\u2019s against it. I just outperform everyone on, show up earlier, never complain.

It couldn\u2019t have cost that much and while you should be fiscally responsible, it\u2019s not unreasonable to have the occasional purchase that makes you happy.", "Well, yeah, I originally come from one of those countries. (I don\u2019t have the impression we\u2019re talking about the religious police coming after you, but some stigma in the older generation about tattoos). \n\nWhat I don\u2019t see is how that is in any way relevant. She\u2019s still a grown woman who paid for her own tatoo. It\u2019s still her body. \n\nEither she gets to make decisions about her body (that don\u2019t impact her family\u2019s safety) or she doesn\u2019t. If you\u2019re going to argue that she can\u2019t make those decisions, it seems to me you\u2019re arguing that living with your parents means that you are not an adult and you shouldn\u2019t have the rights of an adult.", "\"Body autonomy or some BS\"?\n\nYou're incredibly flippant over something as important as control over one's own body.", "She is owning it. But she\u2019s also learning that while she can do whatever she wants, she can\u2019t control how people react to her choices. Like it or not, nobody is required to support her decision. Now that\u2019s something she can deal with.", "OP didn\u2019t know her mum would react in such an extremely irrational way. She expected some disapproval, like her father reacted. She certainly didn\u2019t expect a vague threat to her living situation if she refused to cover it up! You can\u2019t claim it\u2019s just house rules and she needs to abide by them or move out. House rules aren\u2019t a way of controlling every aspect of someone\u2019s life, especially when those rules take away body autonomy! You and OP\u2019s mum think it\u2019s ok to tell an adult what they can and can\u2019t put on their body just because they live under your roof. What this tells us is that you\u2019re a neurotic parent whose love is conditional on you controlling every aspect of your child\u2019s life and body.", "My first piercing was a septum my mom made a huge fuss 3 years later she doesn't even bat an eye at my double nose piercing or my growing number of ear piercings because I at least removed the one that made me \"look like a bull\". It helps that on paper I'm a very good girl, got my degree, while working fulltime, never bring home over night guest ect.\n\n Moving out to get my body mods just isn't realistic I'm in a housing crisis area plus a HCOL area, to be able to move out if have to move about 4 hours away from any major city and my job kinda revolves around being IN major cities so it's wasn't gonna happen.

OP should not have expected mom to suddenly change her stance.", "Ah, I didn't see Australia mentioned.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she expected her mom to be cool with it.
