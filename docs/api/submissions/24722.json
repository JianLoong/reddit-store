I\u2019ve never gotten along with her parents and my brother bites his tongue a lot around them. Since I\u2019m not dating their daughter I\u2019ve never had that mindset. We\u2019ve butted heads in the past over things that to me are minuscule but to them is the end all be all. \n\nAbout a month ago my SiLs sister gave birth to her first child. My SiL has a busy schedule but told her sister to let her know when she goes into labor as she has cleared it with her boss to leave when that happens as she wanted to be there for her sister. \n\nShe never got notified and tried calling but no one answered. A few days later her sister calls her and told her she can come visit the child. She did and found out that her other sister, dad, stepmom and grandparents had all Ben at the birth and hospital. Except for my SiL. She was devastated. She got over it (not really) and the wedding happened and while it was happening I kept an eye on her stepmom. Who complained the entire wedding\u201dit\u2019s taking to long\u201d, \u201cwish they would have done that different\u201d. And she kept going on. I never saw her smile one time but did hear her tell her youngest daughter at the wedding that when you marry someone make sure they are a doctor, lawyer or pharmacist as they make a lot of money and you\u2019ll be secure. Keep in mind my SiLs dad is a pharmacist. This made me so mad as I took it as a personal attack as me and my brother are farmers and don\u2019t make money like those professions. \n\nA few weeks after they got back from the honeymoon, we were drinking and talking and she asked about what I thought of the wedding. I was genuine and told her she would\u2019ve been better off not inviting her family as they were a waste of space and money. She asked me to clarify what I meant and I told her the truth as I see it. \n\nShe is not a part of their family that\u2019s why she was excluded from the birth of her nephew and her stepmom \u201cbitched\u201d the whole time and never once smiled. Telling her daughter to marry for money not love and everything I believed in was bad about them being there. She was getting tearful and we called it an early night. Before I left I told her sorry for going off about her family but I consider her family and can\u2019t stand to see her treated that way. \n\nIt has blown up now into a huge deal. Word got back to her family about their actions and now my brother and family are pissed at me for starting shit. SiL hasn\u2019t really spoken to me except to come jump her car off at work. \n\nSo AITA here?\n\nEdit-1. This keeps getting brought up. I didn\u2019t just start tearing into her family were discussed the wedding and honeymoon and at the end I mentioned it and she asked me to elaborate on what I meant and I did. \n\nEdit2 I am on the spectrum and so I do miss certain social things. I\u2019m a literal person and that makes it difficult when people as me a question cause unless they give me very specific instructions I\u2019ll do exactly as I was told. It\u2019s led to some problems in the past due to me just bleeding out what I\u2019m thinking or feeling. \n\nEdit 3 to the people asking if I\u2019m trying to destroy her relationship with her parents, I\u2019ll have you know it\u2019s already strained. Her parents disproved of the marriage to my brother as we are \u201cpoor white trash\u201d as I\u2019ve heard her family say and also due to things they have done to her in the past. They are the kind of people that go to church and preach about god but are nowhere near being actual Christians. \n\nEdit4. Why would I purposely make her upset. She asked me a damned question and my stupid brain took her question literally which I gave her my entire honest answer. That may make me an asshole for being unfiltered but I truly was not trying to upset her. She is my sister and I love her like my brother.\n\nEdit5. When she initially asked me about her wedding I told her it was beautiful, her dress and decorations were utterly gorgeous which I told her. We discussed other things from the wedding like the venue and how might it have been different. This is when I responded with what has led me to post here. People are assuming that I just burst out and told her that her parents are shitty people. She doesn\u2019t need me to tell her that as she has complained about it for the last 5 years I\u2019ve known her. I just didn\u2019t expect it to spread to her family.", "created_utc": 1692122028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rzndx/aita_for_telling_my_sil_the_truth_about_her_family/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And since you like to brag about how you don't care about their feelings, blah, blah, blah, I think this was way more about you, and not liking them looking down on YOUR family, and it had absolutely nothing to do with SIL. You didn't protect her. You hurt her. Badly. And you're too much of a coward to admit it.", "NTA even before the edits. She deserves to know bc she is an adult wasting emotional energy on people who couldn't keep from shit talking her on her own wedding day.", "NTA. She knows the truth.", "YTA\nShe was asking your opinion on the wedding itself not an analysis of her lift", "NTA  My sister is in autistic spectrum too, so she is literal and unfiltered when speakin. After a while you grow accustomed and is kinda funny asking questions only to hear what will she said.", "YTA, but a completely relatable one. \n\nShe may have needed to hear that, but it probably wasn\u2019t the time, place, or correct framing to do so. And also, that\u2019s not your job. \n\nI am EXACTLY your kind of asshole by nature, it took a long time for me to realize those things.", "I am totally going NTA. Even if you can\u2019t read social queues. And the more information you gave about how you responded and she asked you to elaborate I would have done the same thing. The wedding was beautiful but it looked like your family wasn\u2019t enjoy the day. She said explain, you did because she is family! She needs to take off the rose colored glasses and go NC with her horrible family. Good for you dude. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "I\u2019m not an in your face person. Not sure \nwhat lead you to believe that. Brash I would imagine so. I did have nothing to gain as she knows her parents don\u2019t like me and my family. I\u2019ve told her for years even though she knows that they are toxic people who she shouldn\u2019t invest time and effort in. This time it probably hit close to home since it\u2019s her wedding and they still acted like brats. \n\nYou think that since I\u2019m a literal person I\u2019ll get in your face and get rowdy. I haven\u2019t had a confrontation since my days in the middle school locker room with bullies. \n\nI love my SiL and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let her get tested like shit by people who are supposed to love her.", "I\u2019m not entirely sure. I\u2019m sure she said something to her sisters who ran back to their mom with the information.", "Maybe not\nRight at that moment though", "I'm sure she's well aware of the favoritism by now from dealing with them a lot longer than you. She didn't need your two cents.", "You said \"I\" a half a dozen times. Because this was about you.", ">my brother and family are pissed at me for starting shit.\n\nIt's a bit rich to complain that you started shit when in fact she goes around repeating to people what you said to her in private.\n\nSHE started shit. You just had an honest conversation in private. She has no right to go around telling people what you said and then complain that they found out and blame you for it.", "I think that sometimes people use \u201cBeing on the Spectrum\u201d as just an excuse to be assholes.", "She is and no he doesn\u2019t my father and mother are always helping her and my brother with projects around their house. In the year they have been in their new house. Her parents have been there once and none of her sisters ever come to their house. She goes to visit them. \n\nHer dad is a coward who is also pretty useless in my opinion. The man couldn\u2019t change a tire to save his life so she relies on my brother and myself as well as our family to help her with things as I said above.", "How else do you address yourself while writing from your own point of view?", "Yeah because his feelings were hurt.\n\nWe get that your feelings were hurt. Still not appropriate", "Her birth mom hasn\u2019t been in the picture since she was little. I\u2019ve never asked her as she never mentions it. Her sister did and gave a bullshit excuse like it was bad reception and no one could reach her. I called bullshit on it when I first heard it. In 1999 my cousin managed to call us in the hospital to tell me his wife was giving birth and we were fishing in a rural ass bayou. \n\nIt comes back to her stepmom. My SiL and her always butted heads and never really liked each other. She was I believe 6-7 when her stepmom came in the picture and was not a good mom in my opinion. She and her husband treat SiL differently from their bio children and I\u2019ve seen and known to many people who care about the \u201cblood\u201d relation than anything else which the stepmom obviously does. SiL wasn\u2019t invited to the birth due to the stepmoms wishes and the dad and bio daughter are to \u201cconditioned\u201d by her bullshit and obeyed. SiL cried for an entire day as she and her sisters are close. But it didn\u2019t matter cause stepmom doesn\u2019t like her or see her as her child.", "It doesn't matter what she says about her family. It's not your place to trash talk them because you wanted to give your opinion. You need to stop and think before you say something. You need to think about the consequences before you say it because like now, once you say it you can't undo it and there are consequences."]}
