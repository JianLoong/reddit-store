{"id": 24722, "submission_id": "15rzndx", "title": "AITA for telling my SiL the truth about her family?", "selftext": "So my brother just got married not to long ago to my SiL. I\u2019ve never gotten along with her parents and my brother bites his tongue a lot around them. Since I\u2019m not dating their daughter I\u2019ve never had that mindset. We\u2019ve butted heads in the past over things that to me are minuscule but to them is the end all be all. \n\nAbout a month ago my SiLs sister gave birth to her first child. My SiL has a busy schedule but told her sister to let her know when she goes into labor as she has cleared it with her boss to leave when that happens as she wanted to be there for her sister. \n\nShe never got notified and tried calling but no one answered. A few days later her sister calls her and told her she can come visit the child. She did and found out that her other sister, dad, stepmom and grandparents had all Ben at the birth and hospital. Except for my SiL. She was devastated. She got over it (not really) and the wedding happened and while it was happening I kept an eye on her stepmom. Who complained the entire wedding\u201dit\u2019s taking to long\u201d, \u201cwish they would have done that different\u201d. And she kept going on. I never saw her smile one time but did hear her tell her youngest daughter at the wedding that when you marry someone make sure they are a doctor, lawyer or pharmacist as they make a lot of money and you\u2019ll be secure. Keep in mind my SiLs dad is a pharmacist. This made me so mad as I took it as a personal attack as me and my brother are farmers and don\u2019t make money like those professions. \n\nA few weeks after they got back from the honeymoon, we were drinking and talking and she asked about what I thought of the wedding. I was genuine and told her she would\u2019ve been better off not inviting her family as they were a waste of space and money. She asked me to clarify what I meant and I told her the truth as I see it. \n\nShe is not a part of their family that\u2019s why she was excluded from the birth of her nephew and her stepmom \u201cbitched\u201d the whole time and never once smiled. Telling her daughter to marry for money not love and everything I believed in was bad about them being there. She was getting tearful and we called it an early night. Before I left I told her sorry for going off about her family but I consider her family and can\u2019t stand to see her treated that way. \n\nIt has blown up now into a huge deal. Word got back to her family about their actions and now my brother and family are pissed at me for starting shit. SiL hasn\u2019t really spoken to me except to come jump her car off at work. \n\nSo AITA here?\n\nEdit-1. This keeps getting brought up. I didn\u2019t just start tearing into her family were discussed the wedding and honeymoon and at the end I mentioned it and she asked me to elaborate on what I meant and I did. \n\nEdit2 I am on the spectrum and so I do miss certain social things. I\u2019m a literal person and that makes it difficult when people as me a question cause unless they give me very specific instructions I\u2019ll do exactly as I was told. It\u2019s led to some problems in the past due to me just bleeding out what I\u2019m thinking or feeling. \n\nEdit 3 to the people asking if I\u2019m trying to destroy her relationship with her parents, I\u2019ll have you know it\u2019s already strained. Her parents disproved of the marriage to my brother as we are \u201cpoor white trash\u201d as I\u2019ve heard her family say and also due to things they have done to her in the past. They are the kind of people that go to church and preach about god but are nowhere near being actual Christians. \n\nEdit4. Why would I purposely make her upset. She asked me a damned question and my stupid brain took her question literally which I gave her my entire honest answer. That may make me an asshole for being unfiltered but I truly was not trying to upset her. She is my sister and I love her like my brother.", "created_utc": 1692122028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rzndx/aita_for_telling_my_sil_the_truth_about_her_family/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When someone asks you about their wedding, you say \"I loved the cake!\" or \"The band was great!\" or \"You looked so beautiful.\" You DO NOT take this as an opportunity to hurt her and to stir up trouble within her family. You do NOT say, \"I ... told her she would\u2019ve been better off not inviting her family as they were a waste of space and money. She asked me to clarify what I meant and I told her the truth as I see it.\" You say you were being genuine, and you were. You were being an genuine AH.

Not all opinions, even if correct, need to be expressed.", "Soft YTA - she needed to hear this, but it was the wrong time. You should have waited until she confided in you about her family later down the line. A better thing to do is show her how a loving family behaves so that she comes to her own conclusions. Very rarely do people respond well to having the truth shoved in their faces. It sounds to me like you meant well, but were being a bit messy as well. I get it. Her family is judgemental AF.\n\nAlways remember: what starts in anger, ends in shame. Apologise and don't do it again.", "YTA. You are also hyper-fixated on the stepmom, as if her opinion is SO IMPORTANT. Why were you staring at stepmother the whole time? If you were doing that, YOU weren't smiling either, right? Mind your business, man.\n\nAnd you know what--if the sister didn't want your SIL at the hospital, that is HER CHOICE. She's not a monster for it. She was focused on having a baby at the time. \n\nYou completely tore down her family (who she cares about, faults and all) and told your SIL they don't actually *love her* with a flimsy opening of \"hey, how did you like my wedding?\" Wow.", ">She asked me a damned question and my stupid brain took her question literally which I gave her my entire honest answer. That may make me an asshole for being unfiltered but I truly was not trying to upset her. She is my sister and I love her like my brother.\n\nDoesn't matter what SHE asked, YOU decided to answer her question that way. There is millions of way that you could have answer her question. You are responsible for which way you decided to use. You could have just said that you dislike how her family threat her, and how they seem to not value your brother because he doesn't have a high paying job. You didn't have to go with the \n\n''told her she would\u2019ve been better off not inviting her family as they were a waste of space and money.''\n\nor\n\n''She is not a part of their family''\n\nYour actions speak louder than your intention. No matter how you love her and consider her your family, your actions hurt her. Maybe you were genuine, but that was genuinely hurtful to your SIL. You are mad at her family, but took her on her. Now not only does she feel hurt by your BIL, but she also have to deal with her family having a melt down over what you said.\n\nIt's her family and she have to deal with them the way she see fit. Your job as a BIL is to support her and make your own boundary.

All your mother did was complain and your dad never really smiled or participated. I know their your family but it bothers me they did on your wedding day. It\u2019s like they only went so they could say they went not because they love or care about you. And what your mom said to your sister is sickening. I don\u2019t mean to strike a nerve but you told me to keep and out out for anything that might happen and I\u2019ve told you what happened. They were the only ones to complain or have a problem.

You brought it into the discussion because you decided she should know.  That makes you the de facto shit stirrer.  Absolutely no reason to say what you did.  Your intentions were to make sure she knew how YOU felt.", "She already knows how I feel about her parents cause she has shared the same thoughts.
