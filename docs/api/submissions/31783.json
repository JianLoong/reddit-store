Mainly, I wanted to know why he thought I was spoiling Misty and why he was gungho about treating our other two kids the same. I may have also chewed him out for acting like missing senior year was no big deal because he didn't see how much his daughter looked hurt during Ash's year. And that just because his family cut him off at 18 doesn't mean he can repeat the cycle again for his own children after spending 25 years trying to prove that he is a better parent than they were.\n\nI hate to admit it, but it boiled down to poor communication.\n\nMy husband (MH) just assumed we were giving Misty money to go somewhere on spring break when we've never done it with our other two kids. We told our kids when they were starting college that while we're happy to help them with whatever expenses they will need, we aren't going to fund any activities that will involve binge drinking or acting like a jackass (i.e. Spring Break. I grew up in South Texas. I know that environment).\n\nMH told me he while he isn't upset about how much I spent, he wished I had talked to him about it first since we share finances.\n\nNow here's where I fucked up: I said in my original post that I sent money to Misty. I actually purchased a ticket for her. Knowing how quickly tickets go, I went on the ticket website and just bought one for her.\n\nShe originally wanted to get a mezzanine seat towards the back for $160. I saw some available orchestra seats that were closer to the stage for twice the amount. So I told Misty not to worry about it, and I went and purchased her a better seat in the first row behind some tables. The total came out to around $350.\n\nMH and I talked it over and we made up. We're going to better work on our communication skills moving forward and be more transparent with our finances.\n\nNow here's the big update. Misty came home from college for Thanksgiving. We sat her down at the kitchen table. I had the spreadsheets detailing the amount we spent for Brock and Ash's senior years and the average. We told Misty that we're sorry we never did anything to make up for her lost year.\n\nWe told her that we a budget for her. What does she want to do?\n\nMisty decided she wanted to do two things: The first is to use part of the money to spend spring break in New York. This coincides with seeing Cabaret. Her two best friends attend college in New York, so her plan is to take a train (we live in Boston, so it's a four hour Amtrak ride) and spend the week at her friends' dorm. My husband and I are planning a couple of excursions for them, like dinner at a nice restaurant. But this is all going to take time put together. Misty would also like to use whatever is left to buy a moped.\n\nAll in all, this turned out really well. Misty is ecstatic about seeing Cabaret. This will be her first Broadway show and her first solo trip. We haven't seen her this happy in a long time.", "created_utc": 1701017288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184ew27/update_aita_for_giving_my_daughter_money_money_to/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Finally some decent freaking parents making up to their kid!", "Thank you for the update.
