Mainly, I wanted to know why he thought I was spoiling Misty and why he was gungho about treating our other two kids the same. I may have also chewed him out for acting like missing senior year was no big deal because he didn't see how much his daughter looked hurt during Ash's year. And that just because his family cut him off at 18 doesn't mean he can repeat the cycle again for his own children after spending 25 years trying to prove that he is a better parent than they were.\n\nI hate to admit it, but it boiled down to poor communication.\n\nMy husband (MH) just assumed we were giving Misty money to go somewhere on spring break when we've never done it with our other two kids. We told our kids when they were starting college that while we're happy to help them with whatever expenses they will need, we aren't going to fund any activities that will involve binge drinking or acting like a jackass (i.e. Spring Break. I grew up in South Texas. I know that environment).\n\nMH told me he while he isn't upset about how much I spent, he wished I had talked to him about it first since we share finances.\n\nNow here's where I fucked up: I said in my original post that I sent money to Misty. I actually purchased a ticket for her. Knowing how quickly tickets go, I went on the ticket website and just bought one for her.\n\nShe originally wanted to get a mezzanine seat towards the back for $160. I saw some available orchestra seats that were closer to the stage for twice the amount. So I told Misty not to worry about it, and I went and purchased her a better seat in the first row behind some tables. The total came out to around $350.\n\nMH and I talked it over and we made up. We're going to better work on our communication skills moving forward and be more transparent with our finances.\n\nNow here's the big update. Misty came home from college for Thanksgiving. We sat her down at the kitchen table. I had the spreadsheets detailing the amount we spent for Brock and Ash's senior years and the average. We told Misty that we're sorry we never did anything to make up for her lost year.\n\nWe told her that we a budget for her. What does she want to do?\n\nMisty decided she wanted to do two things: The first is to use part of the money to spend spring break in New York. This coincides with seeing Cabaret. Her two best friends attend college in New York, so her plan is to take a train (we live in Boston, so it's a four hour Amtrak ride) and spend the week at her friends' dorm. My husband and I are planning a couple of excursions for them, like dinner at a nice restaurant. But this is all going to take time put together. Misty would also like to use whatever is left to buy a moped.\n\nAll in all, this turned out really well. Misty is ecstatic about seeing Cabaret. This will be her first Broadway show and her first solo trip. We haven't seen her this happy in a long time.", "created_utc": 1701017288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184ew27/update_aita_for_giving_my_daughter_money_money_to/", "score": 689, "replies": ["Finally some decent freaking parents making up to their kid!", "Thank you for the update.  It's good that everything is working out well.", "[Link to original post.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qxw6f/aita_for_giving_my_adult_daughter_money_to_make/)", "Omg what a great update. Also hahaha you grew up in the valley. Of course you don't want to fund a spring break; I totally get it now. I'm so glad Misty is happy and that you're making things as even as you can. Between all of your kids it doesn't even matter if it's dollar to dollar even, it's the gesture and it's the noticing that matters the most. One thing that's great about my in-laws is that when someone needs help and people have needed help there's been disability and illness and things etc. They try to then do something similar for the other kids as well. Even though the kid being helped at the time, wouldn't resent a sibling needing something extra. You sound like you have a great family and everyone can work on communication skills. It's not just you guys!", "Hope your daughter has a great time! I desperately want to see that show", "Glad for this update. As someone who works in a school, I saw firsthand how devastating it was that those kids lost out on their entire senior year. It was heartbreaking and even now the kids talk about being saddened about missing out on certain things like one class lost out on the 8th grade trip everyone took, another few missed out on certain classes in person like ceramics or robotics which they were sad about and alot just got depressed not being able to be in school. Many also suffered from not learning as well while trying to adjust to online learning. Most won't openly complain but you could see it. A family friends daughter broke down into tears when her prom dress showed up (it had been ordered special in March and showed up in April for their May prom) and she realized she wouldnt likely ever have reason to wear it. Even the next years seniors suffered because they missed things like homecoming and their prom was outside on the field in tents rather than the nice country club it was usually at. Giving a child who had to go through a year+ of disruption to their norm and losing something that was 12-13 years in the making, since they entered school, is nice and if the kids who were able to do their senior activities ever got upset then all you would have to do is point out what they did get. I helped arrange senior things last year and the trip = $500+, Prom= $45 ticket, $100 +/- dress/tux, senior swag/gear/cap and gown= $50-$200, Pictures = $150-400, senior ad and yearbook= $80-150... it all adds up and she likely only got a yearbook, if that. I am glad he came around and that she was so appreciative. She will always remember how awful her senior year was BUT she will also remember this trip and it will make her smile.", "What a wonderful update!  You guys are fantastic parents. I\u2019m so glad you were able to communicate and work everything out.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "So happy for her!", "Wow, you and your husband worked this out so well.  Go good marital communication and non-defensive spouses who listen to one another!!!  I applaud you both.  And what you've done for Misty is so very important and so meaningful for her.  Bravo!!!\n\nNTA, and neither is your husband", "Just out of curiosity, when you think South Texas Spring break, was it San Marcos or SPI that popped up? \ud83e\udd14", "I grew in south Texas too! Glad you did not give them money for that!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nexcept for this: \"My husband and I are planning a couple of excursions for them, like dinner at a nice restaurant. \" .. this is ridiculous. She is not 11. Let her plan her own vacation.", "If she is frugal, the bus is a much more affordable to/from Boston than the train. More pocket money for NYC.", "Not all heroes wear capes.", "Cabaret isn\u2019t just an entertainment; it gives insight into the culture behind the Holocaust.  I\u2019ve seen it several times and the experience is seared into my memory.", "Maybe Misty wanted her parents input on the trip? \n\nAlso, if they're paying they're more than likely making reservations ahead of time and booking other tickets for excursions and the like? \n\nNot really ridiculous."]}
