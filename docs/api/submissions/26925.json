I was tired of his behaviour and as soon as he got back, I left him. This was 8 months back.\n\nThing is, I used to be the breadwinner and caregiver in the relationship. I paid most of our bills and since I worked from home, was primary caregiver for girls. My moving out left him in scrambles especially since he can't afford bills or afford childcare. \n\nYesterday he called me saying how he hasn't paid rent since and is in debt since I left him. I told him its not my problem anymore. He said it was cause of me that he took 50% custody (he never asked me) and now his ex refuse to change it back. That I should atleast send him money to make payments so they aren't evicted. That I owed that to him and his kids \"who saw me as mom\". \n\nI told him while I love them, neither they nor he was my responsibity.

Yes, if your relationship had progressed, it would have been a different story. He showed you who he was and you opted out - and his recent comments cement you made the smart choice.", "NTA. This guy used you, and now he's trying to guilt you by using his own children. Keep him away from your life.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't your responsibility. Helping wouldn't make you a good person.

They see their mom as mom. I'm sure you had a good relationship with the daughters but this is pure emotional manipulation. Also, he's not asking for you to spend time with the daughters. He just wants your money. Don't get conned like this.", "NTA. Sounds like a classic man expecting the women in his life to do the majority of work, childcare, etc. It's probably why his ex left him too. \n\n Y'all weren't even together that long.

Don't let this guy guilt-trip you. What if he never met you in the first place? Who would he call then? No, he needs to grow up and take responsibility. It's not your fault that he does not want to do it.", "Oh no, surely NTA\u2026 but for some good advice: never move in so soon after starting a relationship (especially when kids are involved).\nYou did MORE than should be expected: keep your head high and move on!", "NTA he created the situation. If you were the breadwinner for two years, I would say you have done more than your fair share for kids that you have no legal obligation to.  He needs to grow up and take responsibility for his choices.", "NTA\n\nTime to block his number", "Wow, that guy took the concept of baby trapping to a whole new level. Disgusting. OP, don't feel bad and if you can, block the guy. You might also want to talk to the children's mom, because what your ex is doing is not okay (making you out to be a mom to the kids, having you do the whole childcare and putting the financial burden solely on you).

You can also make a list of times you babysat them and calculate a fair babysitting price and let him know you already helped by giving him X childcare. A whole weekend away with you watching the kids? That would have cost $1000 EASY. Change the narrative with him!", "NTA : You have no fault here and should not ever feel bad you did what you could for the kids while you were in a relationship with their father. I think he is just trying to guilt you because he is probably not over you yet.", "NTA your ex is a freeloader and deadbeat plain and simple, trying to manipulate you into continuing to be his ATM.", "Nta, he was using you and now trying to guilt you into helping the fact he's a loser.

Whatever he did before, he needs to go back to that & figure it out.", "Looks like you dodged a bullet.

I recommend to block him.", "Yep, he\u2019s a dead beat dad who tried to unload his kids and financial obligations onto OP.
