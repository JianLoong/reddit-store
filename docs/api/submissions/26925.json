Not your responsibility.  The madness of assumption here--that you should CONTINUE to pay his bills<rolls eyes>.\n\nGood for you for NOPING OUT when he did that by the way, too many Women let men continue to walk over them, live off them(and before someone makes nasty accusations at my comment--yes women take advantage of men too)", "NTA. \n\nBreadwinner AND caregiver?! Yeah, block this guy's number and don't look back. You put up with far more than you ever should have, and likely the only reason he sought custody was to reduce could support and ditch his kids on you. \n\nRun, girl!", "NTA LOL. Tell him tough cookies and block him.", "NTA.  He got 50/50 custody to keep from having to pay child support. He expected you to care for them so he didn\u2019t have to pay.  Those are HIS kids.  HIS responsibility.  Not yours.  He was using you and still wants to.  Expect the guilt trips to continue.  Don\u2019t fall back into that mess.", "Nta,", "Nta. Was he always this full of bs? This manipulative? Always trying to guilt trip you?! Not only is it not your responsibility, why would it be your fault he didnt pay rent or bills? He's a grown man. If he didnt want to do it on his own, he should have shown some appreciation & learned to ask instead of demanding. All he cared abt was the perks, still does", "NTA.\n\nA bit of advice...he shouldn't have been able to contact you post-breakup, as it was a bad breakup. You should have blocked him so he can't contact you.\n\n(Positive breakups, it's ok to have ways to keep in contact.)", "Maybe his kids miss you, but either way, he's behaving appallingly towards you\nHard NTA", "NTA - you owe this man NOTHING. The children are not yours, you did not adopt them. You are not financially, morally or legally responsible for them. It's his own damn fault that he cannot afford to do whatever it is he wants to do/pay for rent, etc. Count yourself lucky that you got out of there and block the SOB on any social media and your phone.", "NTA as long as you stay this course. He tried to play you a fool, you didn\u2019t let it happen. You are every lazy deadbeats dream, someone that will support them AND their kids by another woman. You showed hi,m. Good for you.", "This. OP, do yourself a favor and block this guy. He seems very good at manipulating you, and you don't need this guilt trip every time he needs money or someone to raise his kids.", "I might go so far as to get in charge of the mother and let her in on what has been said. I am willing to bet she agreed to 50/50 because he argued for it and probably kept loudly doubling down. From the sound of what he is saying to OP he probably threatened all kinds of crap including how bad a long drawn out custody case would be if they couldn't agree on mutual terms. How expensive it would be, and how he would fight to get the kids full time as he had a stable living environment and how as the OP is helping to give the children all the \"extras\" \n\nI am also betting that he never actually went to the mother to change the order because changes would put him back to paying child support. Which he doesn't want to do and if he can't pay other bills he certainly can't pay child support."]}
