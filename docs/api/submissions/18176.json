Why should you have to go all the way up to the 6th floor because of his mistake?", "NTA, but if I were you I'd hope the garage has good cameras. Otherwise I predict keys or slashed tires in your future. Also your place sucks if the receptionist made you talk to the guy instead of handling it.", "NTA. It probably was just a mistake but that doesn\u2019t mean he can just inconvenience other people because of it.", "He's the asshole.\n\nIt was your spot.  If he just moved in, they probably JUST told him the parking rules.  Just because he had work in the morning, whatever, bad choices on his part don't fall on you.\n\nIf I was new to an apartment, and I accidently parked in a spot that wasn't mine, even if it was the middle of the night, I would be apologizing saying something like \"Sorry, I just moved in, didn't realize I was parked in the wrong spot\" because these are my neighbors I have to live with for the foreseeable future.  I wouldn't be flipping them off blaming them for my mistake.", "NTA\nIf he didn\u2019t want to be inconvenienced he shouldn\u2019t have parked in a spot not assigned to him.", "NTA. You don\u2019t want to risk being towed because someone wasn\u2019t paying attention enough during their move in to know the rules.", "NTA\n\n> he flipped me off and said something along the lines of \"bad karma buddy\" \n\n**FOR _HIM_**, maybe.", "NTA.  Your not responsible for assumption that he can park anywhere.  Also, his lack of preparation by not asking what the parking rules/situation was when he signed the lease is his fault not yours.  He was being a lazy AH which needed to use a mirror to flip that recipient off.", "NTA. Also, I don't think he understands how karma works.", "NTA, the bad karma would be on him because he's in YOUR parking spot.", "NTA - it was your parking space. If you were a pushover about it he might park there again.", "NTA\n\nI've lived in apartments with assigned spots before.  They always make it VERY clear when you get all of your move-in paperwork which spot is yours, which spots are available for guests, and what the consequences are for parking in someone else's spot.  He knew which spot was his.  He didn't want to park there.  He took a gamble that no one would do anything about his car being parked in the wrong spot until he left for work in the morning and he lost.  He's lucky all you did was make him move the car.  The last time I had an assigned space at an apartment it was in a similarly desirable location and was \"stolen\" at least every other week until the management office gave me authorization to call the tow company.", "NTA\n\nHe was just being lazy", "NTA \n\nHe should have been given info about his parking spot if he even has one and it was a minor inconvenience so he was just being an AH.", "NTA\n\nIt's your spot and you're entitled to it, you shouldn't have to give up your car spot because someone can't be bothered moving. If he wants to double down on being wrong there's not much you can do about it, other than make him move and then forget about him.", "NTA\n\nIt's your spot. He was wrong.", "NTA- if you'd had let him stay, this would become and ongoing issue.  If everyone gets assigned parking spots, then he'd have been told what his was. HE saw and easy to get spot, took it and hoped to get away with it.", "NTA. It is your assigned parking spot. You are in the right. He doesn't sound like someone who would pay for your towing fines if you got towed. Also, assigned places are usually paid or included in the rental cost. So you literally paid for that spot.", "NTA he fecked around and found out.", "ew, NTA but he is.  why didn't the person at the front desk handle it?  that doesn't seem right.  that's your spot, you pay for it, he needed to move.  period.  what an ass.  i've had my car towed because i parked in someone's spot, unknowingly.  they weren't nice like you and tried to get ahold of me, they just had me towed.  he should consider himself lucky you didn't do that.", "NTA, likely a mistake but that doesn\u2019t justify flipping you off and inconveniencing you either. Dude just moved in and is already trying to make people mad at him?", "Nta\n\nBut he was right about the \"bad karma\", except he was reaping *his* bad karma. He knew spots were assigned, that or he ignored all the paperwork they most likely gave him when he moved in. He tried to take someone else's spot, good on you for standing your ground.", "NTA. Thems the rules.\nHE can park on the 6th floor or wheee8and take the risk of being towed.\n\nYOU have reasons you need to use you space that go well beyond convience for either yourself or him.\n\nIf he wants to be a baby about getting his crap out of your space, so be it.", "NTA, but a strange battle to pick on everyone\u2019s end. It sounds like an honest mistake, but he was the far larger AH for handling it the way he did.", "INFO: \n\nIf you were concerned that you might be towed for parking in someone else's spot, and not sure if you were allowed to park on the sixth floor or another spot closure, why didn't you ask the person on the front desk where you could park that was unassigned? \n\nYou could even, for good measure, asked them to leave a note for any colleagues who might deal take over from them before you would move your car, in case there was a complaint/tow request from a third party, and/or left a note of explanation on your windshield. \n\nOr, could you have asked the front desk to identify the new tenant's actual assigned spot, so that you could park there overnight?  Since the front desk was able to track down the errant parker, it sounds like they had a record the vehicle regs for all residents, so wouldn't they also have a record of which spots are assigned to whom. \n\nAnd just out of interest, how long did you have to wait for him to come down and move his car out of your spot?  (Just wondering here whether the 5 min or so to drive up and time getting back you avoided was still lost as a result of time spent waiting for him to come down.)", "You could have asked the front desk if you could have parked somewhere else. Especially since it sounds like it was an honest mistake on his side. But since you pay for the parking spot I will go with NAH", "esh you can technically be right but still also be a dick", "NAH. \nSounds like an honest mistake. Weird that FD didn't handle it for you or at least offer another solution for the night. That's what they're there for.\nYou weren't wrong for wanting your own space, but you may have just picked a battle with New Guy.", "ESH! Sounds like the guy didn't know he had an assigned space or where it was. He should have had that information. You could have parked on the 6th floor for 1 night and left a note on your windshield.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
