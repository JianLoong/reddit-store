The reason I put quotes is because my mom also has a strong tendency to lie, and it\u2019s gotten to the point where I can\u2019t trust anything that comes out of her mouth.

You can forgive her when she gives you the stolen \u00a31600. That's the only type of apology that matters. Until then, she remains an unrepentant thief.\n\nIf she were actually extremely upset, she'd be taking steps to rectify her thievery. Instead she's putting on a show and deflecting. (as usual)\n\nMeanwhile, the less you interact with or see her, the better.", "NTA.  Next time she screams at you tell her every time she screams at you it negates any apology she ever gave.  Tell her she does not get forgiveness when she has not changed.  Quit falling for the guilt trip.  She is your mother and you deserve better.  Let her cry.  Who cares?  No one should.  They are fake tears to gain sympathy, not an actual expression of remorse or guilt.  If she truly cared, she wouldn't be acting like she is the victim when you are the victim.  She is trying to deflect blame.  Don't fall for it.  The sooner you realize that you should write her off as a person the better off you will be.", "NTA. Will your dad help out at all? \n\nYou are owed that 1600. Demand she pay you back. \n\nThen NC. What a piece of work", "NTA  \nGo non contact and keep it that way. My mother and father are genuinely abusive and horrible people who ruin everyone around them. I went non contact 15 years ago with my father, and going on a year and a half with my mother. I'm 43 and I don't need that toxicity in my life anymore, you don't either.", "NTA - If she did need them for \"house bills,\" then that should have been brought up with you,  not something she tried to sweep under the rug.  Someone apologizing & \"regretting it\" doesn't mean they have been forgiven, as it's not up to them to decide.  She made the decision to split the money a certain way & then went against it.\n\n\"If her mother hadn't had died,\" there wouldn't have been the money to begin with, so she needs to stop trying to pass the blame. \n\n\" are saying that I should just forgive her for the sake of our relationship.\" But when will it end? Will she continue to treat you like that? How she's treating you is not acceptable at all.", "NTA\u2026 Her apology was shallow and insincere.  If she was truly sorry there would be some effort on her part to make it right.  Forgiveness is not something she needs from you, it\u2019s something you do for yourself, and it will come when you are ready, and not when she wants it.", "NTA.  What your mother did was totally wrong and it appears she tries to bully you with her yelling whenever you try to discuss it.  She's an adult and needs to take responsibility for what she has done, not just \"apologize\" and think that erases her bad actions.  What can she do to restore this money? It's clearly a debt she owes you. She, in essence, stole it and needs to return it.  Maybe an account can be set up and she can begin contributing to it to make you whole.  This is the responsible solution and maybe then you can begin to forgive her for what she did.", "NTA, are your parents still together? Are there any family members you could move in with? The way your mum reacts is abusive.", "NTA. Can you protect the 1k left so your mom can't get it? I'm not sure of the rules there, but you have to be 18 in the US to open a bank account by yourself. Perhaps you could have a trusted relative open an account with you.", "It doesn't sound like the kind of a relationship that's worthy of having anything done for its sake. Your friends need to STFU. You are very young, and people tend to come to the conclusion that staying away from their parents is the healthiest thing for them to do much later in life -- and even then, they always have unsolicited advisers in their lives who pressure them to let people like your mother off the hook. It's not clear why seeing her has to be planned -- do you live with your father? are they divorced? -- but yeah, she's going to act like it's *her* not forgiving *you*, and like the fault is yours and forgiveness is hers to give or withhold. At any rate, she sounds like a mess you don't want to muck up your life just as you are starting it. \n\nYou are NTA. \"Just forgive her\" is not a thing. Forgiveness is a long and tough slog, and must be at least asked for.", "NTA. Your mother robbed you and lied about it. \n\nWhen I read about the stories, a question I often wonder is \"if you gave them a pre-prepared apology that acknowledges what they did and why it was wrong, would they read it to earn forgiveness?\"\n\nIndividuals like this always seem like, for all their dishonesty, they are so against taking any responsibility of any kind for even the most innocent of mistakes that they can't even fake an apology. It's always a \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" non-apology.", "Did she also spend your sister's share ?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I don't think the question is what was with the 1,600 pounds. It seems to me that you are dealing with n-parents and the theft was just the last drop. If that's the case, all you should be thinking about is how you're going to get through this mess until you're of age and get out of it. You will never see the money again and you will probably not get any mental support, confirmation or anything like that. I also think that the apology is fake and not real. Try greyrocking, leave them as soon as you can, go nc and never look back. All the best.", "ESH. Something hinkey went on if your mum was persuaded (coerced?) by her brothers  to give her legal share of the inheritance to you. By any chance did any of the uncles end up double dipping?

I\u2019ve been living with my dad for nearly three years now and the court order expires in october but I\u2019ve made it clear to her the rules in it stay the same even after it ends (which funny enough was another thing she was upset with me about.)", "If she were actually extremely upset, she'd be taking steps to rectify her thievery.", "No, but my mom has caused some money problems with my sister before if I\u2019m correct.

(Sorry about that) My mom and dad split up 12-13 years ago and I have been living with my dad for nearly 3 years who is also trying to push her to pay the money back into an account he can control, but she\u2019s making no effort to respond to his messages, so he\u2019s currently looking into further action to help get the money (and some interest) back.", "It was a mutual agreement between the three of them, both of my uncles have two kids and everyone (grandkids) was told about the amount of money they were receiving (apart from me only being told I had \u00a31000). However something did happen that made my mom and one of my uncles stop talking for a while, I am unaware of the reason but I have high suspicion it was to do with the money because my uncles and my mom made it clear they did not want anything from my Nana.", "Most mediation and family therapy does this, and you\u2019ve just hit on one of the limitations of the field. The discipline and practice is based on the idea that all parties are coming to the table with equally valid, rational points to make. This works great in non-abusive situations, like one of my parents also has issues apologizing (for their parents were jerks reasons, not pathological or abusive ones). Rather than the therapist saying one of us was right, one of us was wrong, and who owed who an apology, my parent learned ways to communicate their apology without having to explicitly say or do things that upset them, and I learned how to meet them halfway and accept their attempts with better grace. This worked because my parent is a good person who just has some flaws, I am too, and we love each other and our relationship was equally important to both of us. \n\nThe problem comes when one party is clearly in the wrong, which puts the therapist/mediator in an incredibly bad situation where if they call out the abuse they risk alienating the abusive party and making reconciliation impossible - and there are plenty of abuse cases where it is very possible and abusers can stop and make amends for their abusive behavior. The problem is that in order to get there and with a case that\u2019s this bad and pathological, there has to be a willingness on everyone\u2019s part to go through years and years of hard work, not just a few family court mediation sessions. And sometimes, like in this case, that process simply may not be worth it in the end.", "Unfortunately you'll never see that money. The fact that she's refusing to pay you back directly makes me think that she just wants you to stop talking about it.\n\nWhat's most likely going to happen is she will keep putting you off, for years if possible until she's backed into a corner and has no choice but to admit she lied. At which point she'll throw a tantrum about the fact that you're angry.\n\nAs much as it sucks, you need to write both the money and her off completely. It's awful that you'll lose that money, but your life will be happier without her in it.", "I am sure she is putting money in her account. She is saving it for herself, however.", "I would then ask your dad to go back to court for full custody. And then go no contact with mum. This is gonna affect you mentally and at your age you need good people around you.", "Yeah. Your uncles ripped off your mom. If the estate had been divided [as specified by law when there is no will] by # of siblings, each sibling would have received $2666.66. Uncle 1s [family] got $3200, Uncle 2s [family\u2019 got $3200 and your mom\u2019s [family] got $1600. I suggest you talk with her like an adult.  She still gave you $1000 when legally she didn\u2019t have to, after her brothers ~~manipulated~~ talked her out of her full share. No wonder she\u2019s mad at her brothers and frustrated with you for \u2018refusing to forgive\u2019 her. You feel hurt because you think she ripped you off. Think how she feels that her brothers *did* rip her off. IMHO."]}
