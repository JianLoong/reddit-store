You can forgive her when she gives you the stolen \u00a31600. That's the only type of apology that matters. Until then, she remains an unrepentant thief.\n\nIf she were actually extremely upset, she'd be taking steps to rectify her thievery. Instead she's putting on a show and deflecting.

Tell her she does not get forgiveness when she has not changed.  Quit falling for the guilt trip.  She is your mother and you deserve better.  Let her cry.  Who cares?  No one should.  They are fake tears to gain sympathy, not an actual expression of remorse or guilt.  If she truly cared, she wouldn't be acting like she is the victim when you are the victim.  She is trying to deflect blame.  Don't fall for it.  The sooner you realize that you should write her off as a person the better off you will be.", "NTA.

What your mother did was totally wrong and it appears she tries to bully you with her yelling whenever you try to discuss it.  She's an adult and needs to take responsibility for what she has done, not just \"apologize\" and think that erases her bad actions.  What can she do to restore this money? It's clearly a debt she owes you. She, in essence, stole it and needs to return it.  Maybe an account can be set up and she can begin contributing to it to make you whole.

It's not clear why seeing her has to be planned -- do you live with your father? are they divorced? -- but yeah, she's going to act like it's *her* not forgiving *you*, and like the fault is yours and forgiveness is hers to give or withhold.

Your mother robbed you and lied about it. \n\nWhen I read about the stories, a question I often wonder is \"if you gave them a pre-prepared apology that acknowledges what they did and why it was wrong, would they read it to earn forgiveness?\"\n\nIndividuals like this always seem like, for all their dishonesty, they are so against taking any responsibility of any kind for even the most innocent of mistakes that they can't even fake an apology.

It seems to me that you are dealing with n-parents and the theft was just the last drop. If that's the case, all you should be thinking about is how you're going to get through this mess until you're of age and get out of it. You will never see the money again and you will probably not get any mental support, confirmation or anything like that. I also think that the apology is fake and not real.

The discipline and practice is based on the idea that all parties are coming to the table with equally valid, rational points to make. This works great in non-abusive situations, like one of my parents also has issues apologizing (for their parents were jerks reasons, not pathological or abusive ones). Rather than the therapist saying one of us was right, one of us was wrong, and who owed who an apology, my parent learned ways to communicate their apology without having to explicitly say or do things that upset them, and I learned how to meet them halfway and accept their attempts with better grace. This worked because my parent is a good person who just has some flaws, I am too, and we love each other and our relationship was equally important to both of us. \n\nThe problem comes when one party is clearly in the wrong, which puts the therapist/mediator in an incredibly bad situation where if they call out the abuse they risk alienating the abusive party and making reconciliation impossible - and there are plenty of abuse cases where it is very possible and abusers can stop and make amends for their abusive behavior. The problem is that in order to get there and with a case that\u2019s this bad and pathological, there has to be a willingness on everyone\u2019s part to go through years and years of hard work, not just a few family court mediation sessions.

The court won't force her to pay the money back, it just gives you the legal authority to do so yourself.
