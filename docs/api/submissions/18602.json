Later this summer I am getting married to my fianc\u00e9 Alex [30M] and Matthew is the best man. \n\nMatthew and Alex are close friends and my brother organized the bachelor party trip. During this trip, he met this girl named Marla [late 20s F] and went on one date with her and they flirted, but didn\u2019t kiss (he even told me he found her cute, but a little annoying because she wanted to text everyday). I did not think much of it because her city is on the other side of the country. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and Marla travelled to our city to visit family and ended up reconnecting with my brother. He fell for her hard and fast and they decided by the end of her trip to try to date. Nothing against it, I thought it was very rushed, but I was in a LDR myself with Alex for a while because of circumstances of life before we got engaged. Matthew asked me for Marla to be his date for the wedding reception and for the rehearsal dinner, which I, again, found a little premature but agreed nonetheless. \n\nMore recently, I accidentally eavesdropped a conversation between Matthew and Alex and that included some very private discussions of Marla\u2019s sexual prowess. I pretended I didn\u2019t hear it but I was extremely triggered because Alex seemed a little too interested and I was a little disgusted that my brother would discuss his intimacy like that. \n\nA few days after that, Alex and I finally met Marla in person. She was nice and pretty enough, although I was surprised because she\u2019s not my brother\u2019s usual type (she\u2019s also from a different ethnic and religious background). No matter how much she tried socializing with, I confess I was still upset and wasn\u2019t very nice to her. Matthew noticed and confronted me over text, so I called him and told him the truth about why I was upset and didn\u2019t want his girlfriend at the wedding. I did say some explicit things and called Marla names (which I do regret) and told my brother that he wasn\u2019t in love, he was just in lust because she does some unusual bed stuff. \n\nAlex ended up hearing the call and tried reasoning with me. He did say he was sorry for engaging in this type of conversation. I\u2019ve forgiven him but he thinks we should let Matthew bring Marla to the wedding. My parents are also on Matthew\u2019s side and are pressuring me (they helped pay for the wedding), saying that my brother really likes this girl, etc. She\u2019s not aware of the whole conundrum just yet, as far as I know. \n\nHonestly, for me is almost a matter of honor. I don\u2019t see why I should have to see this person I don\u2019t know even at my rehearsal dinner and reception just because my brother is throwing a tantrum. It is my wedding, not his. He\u2019s threatening not coming to the wedding if I don\u2019t let it go. \n\nTL;DR: I don\u2019t like my brother\u2019s new girlfriend.

It's okay to be jealous, as long as we're aware of it, and you clearly are. That's a good first step. The next step you need to take is to stop taking your jealousy out on other people.\n\nBy your own description, you were extremely rude to Marla, whose only fault in this exchange seems to be \"being someone guys talk about.\" What does it matter what she does behind closed doors with consenting adults? Why do her private decisions give you the right to judge her?\n\nYou could argue that her decisions aren't private when your brother and fianc\u00e9 are talking about them, and there's some truth in that. But you know who's to blame for that, right? Your brother, for publicizing his sex life, and your fianc\u00e9, for encouraging it. To start with the former, it's okay to tell him \"I love you, and I don't need to hear all the sordid details about your relationship.\" Having a boundary is fine. Saying \"I will not let my fianc\u00e9 near anyone he's remotely interested in\" is not a boundary, at least not one you get to set.\n\nAnd now, onto Alex himself. You say you've forgiven him, which is fine! But you also act like if he looks at Marla in five seconds they'll be making out on the dance floor. Your actions and your words don't match here: either you've forgiven him and trust him to be faithful to you (and to watch his words), or you haven't and you're scared someone more \"sexually interesting\" will steal him away. If it's the former, act like it. If it's the latter, now might be a good time to look into some counseling to help you through this patch- or reconsider whether you want to be with Alex at all.\n\nWhile the couple can choose who to invite or not for any reason, denigrating your brother's partner and being rude to her face means YTA regardless of invitation status. It's up to you whether you want to repair this or not.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry, this is for whose \u201chonor\u201d exactly? Do you not want her at the wedding because you think your fianc\u00e9 is mind cheating? Or because you are jealous? Or because you are slut shaming? It\u2019s one of those and all of those reasons suck.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t dislike her because of something she did, you dislike her because of things other people did to her. You don\u2019t even know if she is comfortable with your brother sharing these intimate things about their sexlife, and yet you act as though she somehow did something to you.\n\nYou already told your brother she could come, so now you have to be true to your word. \n\nYour insecurities are YOUR problem to deal with.", "YTA So you don\u2019t like this girl because of her sexual \u201cprowess\u201d (LOL) and being from another race and religion. Just wow! You\u2019re acting like a racist, bigot and sexist all at once. Yes, you\u2019re the asshole for denying your own brother a +1 because you for whatever are threatened by what she does in bed with your brother.", "YTA-For multiple reasons and don\u2019t sound mature enough to be in a marriage.", "YTA for all those reasons. Not a single thing on your list is Marla\u2018s fault. Great choice to destroy your relationship with your brother over *being jealous that your fianc\u00e9 and your brother talked about your brother\u2019s sex life*. Great choice blaming a woman you hardly know and say is nice enough for the behaviour of two horny men who are close enough to you that you should take it up with them. Great choice to alienate family due to your own insecurities. Maybe you should get some therapy before you get married.", "YTA...you told him he could invite her and now changed your mind because you feel a certain way.  What she does with your brother in the bedroom is none of your business.  His relationship with her is none of your business.  Yes...you are the bride and it's your wedding but are you really going to base your opinion of this girl on locker room talk that you were never meant to hear? So what if the relationship is based on lust.  He isn't 5 and you aren't his mother.  Enjoy your day and pick a different hill to die on.", "YTA 100%\n\n>More recently, I accidentally eavesdropped a conversation between Matthew and Alex and that included some very private discussions of Marla\u2019s sexual prowess. I pretended I didn\u2019t hear it but I was extremely triggered because Alex seemed a little too interested and I was a little disgusted that my brother would discuss his intimacy like that.\n\nNone of these are Marla's mistakes.\n\n>She was nice and pretty enough, although I was surprised because she\u2019s not my brother\u2019s usual type (she\u2019s also from a different ethnic and religious background).\n\nYou have no right to judge what is your brother's type and this alone makes you an AH because no one likes someone judgemental that thinks they get to decide what type one gets to like\n\n>I did say some explicit things and called Marla names (which I do regret) and told my brother that he wasn\u2019t in love, he was just in lust because she does some unusual bed stuff.\n\nHow would you like it if someone told your fiance what he had with you was just lust?\n\n>Honestly, for me is almost a matter of honor. \n\nWhose honor? This has nothing to do with honor and you know it.", "YTA. Go off on Alex and Matt but what'd Marla do to deserve this? The only time she met you, you weren't nice to her. Then you tried to slut shame her behind her back after eavesdropping in on a private convo.\n\n>I don\u2019t see why I should have to see this person I don\u2019t know even at my rehearsal dinner and reception\n\nThis would've been a valid point, except Matt had asked you for permission and you agreed to invite her. You're trying to hide your jealousy and prejudice behind \"honor\". What honor?", "YTA...so you're judging a woman for (presumably) enjoying sex and/or having an active and healthy sex life?  It's your wedding so I guess you can be as intolerant as you'd like but I think you can probably say goodbye to you and your brother being best friends since you've decided this is the hill you die on.", "YTA\nHonestly OP, you just sound unhinged at this point. You seem determined not to like Marla for any reason. From what I can tell from your story, the only offense Marla has committed is dating your brother. As his gf, why shouldn\u2019t she be his +1?  You say it a matter of \u201chonor\u201d, but whose honor? She has done nothing disrespectful. If anyone was disrespectful, it was your brother who was talking about their intimate life with someone else and yet you want to take it out on Marla. You said you called her names and said explicit stuff about her? Why? By your own admission she was \u201cnice\u201d, yet you talk trash about her behind her back\u2026You say you were not very nice to her because you were upset . Why were you taking any of this out on her?\n\nIt sounds more like you are jealous of her, than anything else. The comment about her being \u201cpretty enough\u201d was very catty, and your own admission about calling her names (for no discernible reason) was illuminating. \nThe only one \u201cthrowing a tantrum\u201d here is you. Your brother is simply standing up for his girlfriend who from your own account was nice to you ( yet you were rude for no reason .)", "YTA\n\n\u201cI was a little disgusted that my brother would discuss his intimacy like that.\u201d\n\nSo why aren\u2019t you uninviting your brother?\n\n(Edited to clarify that I don\u2019t think this is an uninvitable offence.

You gave the permission, and now want to revoke it over perceptions of her that are none of your business.", "YTA. Ever heard of the concept of slut shaming, because that is exactly what you are doing here. I mean it is your wedding and you can invite or disinvite who you want, but you are TA for the reasons for which you want to disinvite her.", "YTA. Don\u2019t let the jealousy stain your shirt on your way out.", "YTA.

Everyone is ragging on you over jealousy, but it's your wedding and no one is owed a date.\n\nIt sounds like your brother is stringing along some poor girl who is into him to use her for sex, and depending on the content of the conversation I'd probably be uninviting my brother AND / or reconsidering who I was marrying if I found my fiance engaging in such talk.\n\nBut you can't pretend this is Marla's fault and your fiance is some pure innocent party here.", "YTA, sounds like you're jealous about the attention she's getting from the men in your life.

Life is going to be difficult with, or without a partner. \n3. You need to love, respect, and trust your partner. Because, if you don\u2019t, every difficulty will turn into resentment and bitterness, and your marriage will come to an end for one of those reasons.\n4. Honesty is the best policy. In every respect. It is the only way to be happy, and harmonious (ie. you have to ask for what you need and want, and be honest with yourself about what those things are).\n5. Jealousy is normal, and should be addressed. People don\u2019t just have an affair out of the blue. It is a result of many tiny decisions to ignore each other, ignore our desires, ignore our spouse\u2019s needs, ignore an attraction we might have to another person. \nWe have to be aware of what we feel and why. If someone in the relationship is attracted to another person, they have to admit this, and figure out how to avoid that person, if they respect and love their spouse. If someone is having difficulty connecting with their partner, and feeling love for them, they have to figure out why, and how to improve things.\n6. We are in charge of our own happiness. Before you can fully commit to another person, you have to love, and cherish yourself. \n\nAnd along with all of that, you need to separate your anger towards your parents, your brother, and your fianc\u00e9e, and deal with each accordingly. Whether you choose to have this girl at your wedding, is up to you. But, resolve all of these issues first. Writing can be a great way to communicate our feelings to people, because confrontation triggers almost everyone. Reading a letter or email gives us time to take in, and digest information, before we respond.\n\nBe honest, and kind to your fianc\u00e9e and family (they love you), and try to be open to hearing their side as well. \nWeddings are stressful, but they don\u2019t have to ruin your relationships. \n\nGood luck OP.
