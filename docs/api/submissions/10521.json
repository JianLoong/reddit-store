Personally I'd have a signed agreement of some description.  And receipts.", "Should clarify I wouldn\u2019t personally do this to my partner. But I\u2019m my hypothetical scenario \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI dunno. Something to really think about.", "So what?  She can do that. Or she can live with him if she wants. But she should pay rent.", "...if she pays rent to someone else, she's still paying someone else's mortgage so they can eventually own the property without paying it all themselves. That's literally how renting works. She'd also probably be paying more, as rent usually covers a lot more than just half the interest and half the HOA fees.\n\nThe only real benefits to renting somewhere else would be the fact that a landlord can't kick her out on a moments notice just because the relationship soured, and they cover all the maintenance.", "LOL the interest allows equity to build.  Not sure that renting from your boyfriend is always an advantage since should the relationship sour she might have to move on very short notice--and telling that barely a month in she's already considering if she'd be better off renting elsewhere.", "It's not a good idea to assume everything will go well and you definitely will marry your partner - thus relying on them for a home especially.\n\nAnd what if they break up, he dies, they lose the home? Many things could stop her becoming a homeowner.\n\nIt's not even partially her asset. Her name isn't anywhere. Be realistic.", ">But as a tenant, she would have a lease and security.  As it stands, if they break, she is immediately homeless.", "Jesus. I just looked it up and it's not required in a lot of states. That's fucking wild man and totally fucked up.", "Well you got a raw deal. I\u2019ve rented 3 and all 3 included refrigerators.", "That\u2019s so crazy", "My bad. Op has me wound up. I clearly need to step away from Reddit for a bit", "For what exactly?", "I didn\u2019t do any of this, I\u2019m not doing this, this isn\u2019t about me. These are all things that OP\u2019s GF should have, considered and weighed before moving in. It doesn\u2019t sound like she was forced into this. And it sounds like she has the means to get her own apartment if she chooses. \n\nIt\u2019s usually a mutual decision to move in together and not forced. If this was forced I would obviously have different opinions and this would be a different conversation.", "She has makes decent money. She wouldn\u2019t be out on her ass if they broke up. If she was a tenet she would also have to deal with all the restrictions that come with a lease.  \n\nI\u2019ve said it once and I\u2019ll say it again SHE MADE THE CHOICE TO LIVE WITH HIM rather than renting. Obviously the benefits of living with him were enough for her to choose that. \n\nIn my state a landlord can break a lease the same way a tenet can. With a 30 day notice. No one safe. (Assuming they pay their dues) Homeowners are", "I know you're not doing this, hence why I specifically mentioned \"her\" in my comment...\n\nMutual decision or not, that attitude is stupid.", "YTA. Damn, you nitpick. I can totally see you counting every square of toilet paper and telling her how much she will pay per square. You sure took the romance out of what should be an exciting time in a relationship.", "YTA My advice is to ask her what she thinks is fair.", "YTA, but not an uber AH.\n\nYou specified an amount for rent. It's not her house. As long as she's paying that amount, maintenance, repairs, pest control, landscaping, broken pipes - those are yours. Totally fair for utilities, but that's it. It's not her house, and the upkeep isn't hers to cover.", "This is a tough one. I agree expenses should be split by both people living there. Even when I was married, we split the expenses and never merged finances, but we talked about it and did it in a way that was fair and beneficial to both of us - I paid the rent and water, but he paid the cable, internet, for groceries, and the electric. It worked for us. $35 extra or less didn\u2019t require an entire budget adjustment. \n\nYou sort of just seem like you\u2019re trying to nickel and dime every last thing when let\u2019s be serious, without her you\u2019d have to pay everything yourself. You\u2019re benefiting from any amount she contributes. YTA for making a relationship partner feel like a tenant.", "Your financial agreement is that of a tenant and a landlord, since her name isn\u2019t going on any claims to the property. Pest control and maintenance are landlord expenses, not tenants. She\u2019s entirely right, if she\u2019s gonna have to pay all that she may as well go find her own apartment where she at least has the security of a legal contract.", "INFO: Have you created or offered a lease?", "NTA for rent bc I mean she lives there now too & that makes sense, but anything else she shouldn\u2019t have to pay. You lived there first and you bought the house, that\u2019s ur problem buddy. She\u2019s just living there & didn\u2019t buy it with you.", "YTA because you conveniently left out that you are now trying to get your gf to pay half of the maintenance on the house. You both agreed on how much rent she should pay you before she moved in. You don't get to change how much she pays after she moves in.", "YTA. You charge the rate for renting a room in your area. End of story", "YTA, not for charging her rent, that\u2019s only fair, but it\u2019s not on her to pay for maintenance. You and she need to figure the fair market value on a rental in which she is in a shared space, and then her half of utilities, that\u2019s IT, and she certainly should not find herself paying more than she would if she were renting. Good luck.", "Yes, this. \n\nOP you need to stop thinking about the benefit to your mortgage, and/or what your actual costs are, because that\u2019s not the relevant factor. \n\nDid she want to come & live with you at the timing she did, or was she lured into it by you offering a cheap financial deal?\n\nShe said that if she had to pay the extra $17.50 (is that once a year? Monthly? Weekly?) she might as well move out. \n\nDoes that imply she never really wanted to move in to start with?\n\nOr that what she\u2019s paying you is already close to market rent so she\u2019ll be paying more than she\u2019d otherwise have to for the \u201cbenefit\u201d of living with you?\n\nOr is she just emotionally blackmailing you into financing her life? \n\nYou have potentially confused the thinking for both of you around this, by linking any payment she makes to you with your mortgage. \n\nYou didn\u2019t need to do that. \n\nShe would have to pay rent if she wasn\u2019t living with you - there is no obligation for you to continue with your expenses unchanged but hers drastically cut. \n\nThe best approach is to agree something where both of you are better off than you would be otherwise. \n\nMaybe that looks like her paying 75% of her previous rent total, while you also get a reduction to your overall expenses. \n\nRemember as landlord you have the emotional / admin hassles of all the maintenance. Organising the pest control people to come out. Making sure the boiler is regularly serviced. Dealing with emergency plumbing problems. \n\nAnything she pays you in \u201crent\u201d can go into your emergency house repairs fund (notionally). \n\nThere is no need for you to subsidise her life. \n\nBut you\u2019ve left it a bit too late to make major changes to the numbers for this year. This should have been discussed before she moved in. \n\nAlso, this is on the ethics of who pays how much. Depending on where you live you might want paperwork so that the money she pays is clearly \u201crent\u201d to a \u201clandlord\u201d and doesn\u2019t give her any entitlement to the property. But also you\u2019ll probably have to pay tax on that income. Make sure you have a \u201ccohabitation agreement\u201d drawn up (or whatever it\u2019s called locally to you).", "Yes you are if I go and buy a house and rent it to you the rent I charge will include all of that and more to make a profit. What he suggesting is less than that.", "You do realise that fair market rent is going to be much higher than what he's charging now, right?", "> expecting her to help you build equity in your house but trying to call it rent.\n\nDo you think it should be illegal then for people to let out a house they have a mortgage on?", "Why not? They are in a relationship not married.\n\nI have seen exact posts on Aita where if it's the woman who is the homeowner then the men are leeches trying to live rent free and if its men who are homeowner then why is this AH charging his gf rent and building equity that he won't share.\n\nUtter hypocrisy on this sub is sometimes mind-boggling", "It often is, letting out a house requires a specific kind of mortage.", "why do you believe she sucks as well?", "Because she\u2019s entertaining this BS by negotiating with him, when he\u2019s reaping all the long term benefits. She\u2019s ignoring the giant red flag.", "This is the same in NZ. I think it\u2019s 3 years here. And yes usually one buys the other out or the house gets sold and split. Can u quite u fair in some instances", "The freedom of paying much more than she is now?", "Market rent is almost certainly **much** higher than what she's paying.", "If that's true then it is still a good idea to have a contract and receipts.", "To protect both parties. She's paying rent."]}
