If he\u2019s not contributing to most of the electric cost, he shouldn\u2019t be getting away with using most of the electric.\n\nIt\u2019s very possible he\u2019s costing thousands per month in electric depending in his rigs, if it\u2019s only a few hundred extra than it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019s making much profit or any profit at all if he also had to pay the electric bill, so he\u2019s basically making profit directly from OP because he keeps the coins, while OP pays the electric bill.\n\nI\u2019d give him 3 choices. He either picks up 100% of the electric bill, he disconnects his mining equipment or he moves out and can then mine all he wants while he\u2019s paying his own bills.\n\nFor those saying it\u2019s not much more of a cost, an Antminer D3 pulls around 1.2kW, 8 of those at the UK rate of ~\u00a30.30 per kWh running 24/7 would cost me \u00a325,000 a year on top of all my other electric usage (~\u00a3100/m). Even if the son has a less powerful rig and electricity is cheaper, he should still be covering the cost of his electric used from the profits of his coins.
