Im really not degrading your calculation or in any other way. You clearly just dont know what cryptomining entails.  Im nudging you in te right direction.", "How could OP 'police' this?\n\nThey go to work, to sleep, out for whatever reason, and he's back to running them all.\n\nHow many would be ok since he still won't be contributing?", "you are so off on your calculations you're clearly being deliberately obtuse. Multiple computers crypto-mining, and it's 100% going to be a 24/hr thing (my bf used to, but he realised it was a lost cause a while ago) so he is almost certainly going to be using the vast majority of the power and causing the bills to rise. And depending on where you are in the world, there are already insane pressures on power bills without that.", "You also need to consider the increased cost of air conditioning. Crypto mining will dump an immense amount of heat into OP's home. They might as well be running a couple of space heaters all day long.", "You don't even know where they live, you aren't doing math, you are making shit up", "O hell no. Make him pay his part or kick him out", "I'm guessing UK and you're right electricity is ridiculous right now with the price hikes my usage hasn't changed but because the rate has my bill is more than double. Gas is even worse! Get your son to cough up or get out because he's effectively stealing money from you to make money for himself because he has no business outgoings because he's not paying for the electricity for running 8 mining pcs 24 hours a day.", "Yeah I thought it wasn't very lucrative anymore? So how much money is OP's son really make?", "\ud83e\udd23 yup", "Did you not read the OP? The son is refusing to pay all the extra costs, OP is having to pay it themself.", "Give it up. The dad said he works for minimum wage and 1/4 of his income goes to electricity his son is using to mine bitcoin. He\u2019s not jealous, he\u2019s sick of funding his leech sons bs bitcoin business when he\u2019s not paying any part of the bills. That\u2019s all there is to it. The bill went way up. The son makes money off mining bitcoin. And he doesn\u2019t help with the bills", "No, what OP asked was whether they were out of line for throwing out their son for using excessive electricity and refusing to contribute. The question wasn't \"please can some random redditor start pumping me for private financial information so that they can decide how much the son should be paying\". This is Reddit Overreach. \n\nThe son could, in theory, have been asked to move his farm elsewhere but even then if he has an income and is living in the house, he should contribute. The answer is NTA."]}
