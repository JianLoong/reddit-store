Or depending on your provider could \"pause\" any devices that are his, if he can't access the internet there's no use of the electronics. \n\nI just feel as if jumping to kick him out is a little extreme. However your past is vague and left up for interpretation. \n\nBest of luck!", "NTA. I'd make him start paying rent and electricity.

Should have already been out on his own.  The fact that you\u2019ve been so gracious as to host him this long, should have been enough.

On the street.", "NTA \n\nYou wanting an adult to pay for 50% of a bill they are running up is reasonable.

I have no idea what crypto mining is, but if he is making money ( as he says he is) and not paying you rent, he is a scrounger.  If he's doing stuff that uses a lot of power he should pay the excess.

Lock out the circuit breaker to his room and give him a battery powered light for his room.

Kick your lazy ass son out and tell him to get a job and an apartment.  Why, as a parent is everyone so afraid of their kids and what they are going to say?  Get a backbone.  You can't afford to support him.  Maybe you are the ah for not having a backbone and be a strong parent and not letting your son walk all over all over you.  Good god man.", "YTA for raising a son who wouldn't pay half the electric bill when he's using probably 3/4 the power. This conversation sounds have started before now. Now you've raised a self centered AH and your solution is to just release him onto the world. Who do you think it's supposed to teach him to be a better man? Where is he supposed to get that from?", "isn't mining crypto kinda over? I'm not that knowledgeable about it but I thought that the rate you can mine crypto gets exponentially smaller all the time and that means the electrical costs get exponentially larger.  I thought people basically stopped mining crypto years ago because it was so hard to make any money doing it, even if you're not paying for 100% of your electricity", "no", "NTA.

Ur son is a greedy ass.", "Nta, but gpu based crypto mining is dead so im pretty sure this is bullshit.", "NTA - he's investing using your money and the only way to stop it is to not have him there. It's a painful but rational choice. I'm sorry he isn't mature enough yet to honor his relationships by not using you as a slush fund for his gain.", "NTA. Go take a picture of your electric meter and write down how much it uses over a time period. Now go flip the breaker for his BS thieving rig and measure over the same time period. Create a bill & present it to him along with the new rent contract. Then it\u2019s agreement or 30-day notice to vacate.", "NTA, he isn't make any money, he is basically stealing it from you via crypto mining. I wonder if how much he make crypto mining even matches the cost of the power he is using. He should be paying the entirety of the power bill imo. Also, crypto currency value is very volatile and honestly the whole thing is imo a bit of a scam.", "Absolutely not!", "NTA. And by the way, your son is definitely an asshole. He makes more than you, uses the lions share of the power, and doesnt pay anything towards it? Yeah in my house his feet wouldn't even hit the floor.", "Simple answer: no", "INFO - can you not charge him rent?", "Just flip the breakers off...

Part of cryptomining is you are essentially running up your electric bill the more you are mining. I bet 75% to 90% of your bill is from him.

He's making money off your electricity too and not paying.  I know that kills the electric bill.  Since he is making sooooooooooooo much money, tell him to buy a place and pay his own bills.  He should not be doing this on your back.", "Nope.", "In order to make him move out you will need to take him to court. It's the only legal way to do i,t. I had to get a lawyer and take all the proper steps to evict my daughter and her husband from my house. Even though your son is family he is considered a tenant and has all tenants rights. Go to legal aid for assistance. Good luck,", "NTA and congrats.", "NTA. He has money, he\u2019s a grown adult.

That being said, crypto mining is kind of like trading electricity for digital currency.\n\nThe son should be paying pretty much the entire power bill.

I'm disabled due to lupus. I do have an income, and my husband works. We own our home. As long as our kids were in school full time, they weren't expected to pay any rent. They all have had part-time jobs and helped pay for their transportation, gas, and phones (we helped them get used cars). Once they graduated or were no longer full-time, they have been expected to pay a nominal amount of rent, car insurance, phones, clothes, and house expenses. This encourages responsibility and accountability. Each one was \"eased\" into it. We didn't just drop the hammer on them at 18. You train your kids up from a very young age with increasing responsibilities so that by the time they get to be 21, they shouldn't be shocked or surprised to be helping around the house or paying for things. So, I have to wonder here if OP has failed a bit on the parenting program and has clearly not managed expectations in his OWN HOME. This does not excuse his son. A 21 year old knows when they're taking advantage of someone. They do have agency. I think it has taken two to make this situation happen, and they're both TA. .", "Wait people are allowed to live at home their parents home without paying bills? Once I was 18, if I had a job, I had to pay bills. What is this privileged life?

It's like running long-life incandescent bulbs. They use more power to create similar amounts of light. If you use just one, it's not that noticable.

I remember how unfair I felt that it was, even after they went over household expenses and explained how cheap that is for rent and food. What they taught me was to budget. Knowing I needed money allocated to pay for my bills helped prepare me for that reality. Charging rent to a family member who is able-bodied, and bringing in money of their own isn\u2019t taking advantage of that person, it\u2019s acknowledging the fact that precious few things are free in this life. Sharing some of those costs is considerate and kind. Exploiting your family for the cost of running your business is unloving and inconsiderate. By paying the electricity bill, he could continue mining at your home and not pay rent. You came to ask if you\u2019re the AH if you kick him out. I say no.
