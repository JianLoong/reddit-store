So if the kids are still in Uni and live elsewhere, the parents have to pay for their rent by law. Or, the kids live at home. For example, my father (75) never left the family house. He got married, my mother moved in and we grew up with our grandparents, who stayed with us till their deaths. If all adults in the house have jobs or a pension, usually they share rent, bills, food etc. But if someone is unemployed, disabled, a stay at home parent or whatever, nobody kicks them out.
