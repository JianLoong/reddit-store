I'd advise you to give her exactly 0% of the company, and she should probably find employment somewhere else.", "NTA - 1) your company that you founded 2) nowhere had she talked about actually being a true shareholder with her money into the company.

DO NOT go through with part ownership, I can guarantee you this will not end well.\n\nDon't let her use that toxic \"but faaamily\" mentality to trick you into giving away half the business you created and worked hard for. 5-8 hours of work a week, for which she was paid a generous salary, and she thinks she built your business and should be gifted half of it?! This is absolute insanity!!!", "She isn't being professional in these negotiations. Are you sure that you would even like to own a company with her?\nEdit: NTA", "YWBTA if you caved in to your sister's demands.\n\nHow did she go from doing a little work for 5-8 hours a week to thinking she was entitled to 50% of your business?

She thinks that just because she's your sister she's entitled to a part of what you own.", "NTA\n\nShe pulled 5-8 hours a week and was paid hourly.", "NTA, Honestly I'd email the documentation you made to any family members giving you grief.  \n\nYou should never be below 51% owner unless someone is flat out buying you out.  \n\nDepending on what you company is worth giving away some percentage because family, and because keeping the peace might make some sense.  But even then your company would have to be worth very little to even consider that.", "NTA. She was paid, and not unreasonably so.\n\nBut _WHY THE F*CK_ did you even entertain the idea of giving her a part of the business for nothing to start with? That's on you, you poisoned the well by not making sure that any such questions weren't met by immediate response question of what her contribution will be. Pretty sure you could hire plenty for $25/h for a few hours a week.", "NTA, she worked 8 hours a week and you employed her and paid her well. It is insane to think she should own any part. Your husband was very smart about having you list out the financial contributions, I would also write out the amount of time worked you put in versus her, then I would show her and any family interested the evidence. A 10% stake is a token of appreciation to your sister for her help, not really something she is owed at this point. Probably best to let her go with a nice severance package to keep the peace at this point though.", "NTA. Sis wants a free pass in life. Working 5-8hrs per WEEK and claiming she build the business. Little delusional there are we.", "NTA. She wants 50% of your company where she\u2019s an overpaid secretary but doesn\u2019t want to put any money into it? She is greedy and entitled. I\u2019d give her a 2 weeks notice of termination and keep my company. If the family wants to complain ask them if they want to give up 50% ownership of their home or car to the sister and her pay nothing because it\u2019s the same premise, except on your case she\u2019d be making money. That should shut them up.", "NTA, answering emails is not building a business. Don't give her anything. With that entitlement it will eventually kill your business and your relationship.", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds very entitled.\n\nYou hired her to help her out, and now she's entitled to half the company? That's some pretty ego-centric thinking there.", "NTA, she's just being greedy and manipulative. If she's not happy with your fair proposal let her start her own business. Also, this is generally why business and family/friends don't mix well. Might be better off going separate ways regardless and hope she gets over it eventually.", "NTA this is why we dont mix business with family. She is an employee you hired not a business partner .", "NTA she was basically trying to steal from you. You should probably let her go, she\u2019s not going to do good work for you now.", "Omg. NTA. Don\u2019t even entertain her drama. I don\u2019t know what kind of relationship you have but her entire shtick is BS. Honestly. \n\nIf I ever tried to pull this on my sibling, which I would never, they would quite literally laugh in my face. I\u2019d probably join in on the laugh. Your sister\u2019s a joke, she\u2019s either really that dumb and greedy, or really smart and manipulative. Please don\u2019t fall for it. \n\nYour idea of incremental percentage in ownership offset by how much she invests - financial, time and energy wise is more than fair. \n\nDo you guys have a history of you being a pushover, her stomping on boundaries or taking advantage of you?", "Your mistake was not saying no straight away. Is she expecting to continue doing less than 10hours of admin a week for 49% share? NTA", "NTA. \n\nI think you were far too generous to even suggest 49/51. She's being entitled and completely ridiculous.", "NTA. For many reasons but also, you can\u2019t own a business 50/50. It\u2019s always 51/49 for shared businesses", "NTA. Your sister wants that \u201centitled I am family, I deserve a cut\u201d of your business.  She was your employee.", "NTA. What makes her think she is entitled to something after only working a few hours a week and not investing her own money. She was compensated for her time. Tell her to go work those hours at another business and ask that owner for the same agreement. She'd get laughed out of the building. .....And she f*ng knows it.", "NTA, please, for the love of any higher power, do not agree to 50/50 ownership. If she's difficult now, think about how things will end up in the long run. At this point I wouldn't give any % of the business to her, if things go well, she'll take credit for it, like she does now, if by some reason business is slow, hits a though spot, temporarily, I'll let you guess who she'll blame. Besides, mixing business and family rarely goes well, this situation is a perfect example, you hired her, paid her for the job she's done and look at her entitlement.", "NTA. If she can\u2019t handle a single disagreement imagine how it will be once she owns any part of the business. She is clearly getting greedy with your success and is not entitled to any of it. You were very gracious offering 30%. If you weren\u2019t related and you weren\u2019t so nice, she wouldn\u2019t be going from employee to part-owner; she would be going from employee to unemployed.", "I am confused here. Why are you even offering 49%? Does she bring anything to the table except for the 'I am your sister' point? Does she add in any investment of money or expertise?", "NTA. You were incredibly generous to have initially offered *30 per cent*. It's your business, you started it and have done the majority of work in building it. She's lucky you're even offering 10 per cent for free. 5-8 hours a week? I spend that much time shitting in a week.", "NTA, but wow\u2026 the fact the you even CONSIDERED giving her any ownership, let alone 50/50, without considering upfront contributions (or really any details) shows you really need to step up your game as a business owner.

As others have said, she's an employee.\n\nFor context that may help you, I'm employee #3 at a large startup. My duties have significantly more responsibility than your sister and I can put a huge financial value to my work. I'm the top performer with respect to billable hours and revenue. Despite all this, my equity offer was for 2%. Your sister wanting 50:50 shows a staggering level of entitlement for something that you built. You also shouldered the risk.

My second question is, why did you not have something in writing in the first place? My third question is have you paid her anything up until this point and if so do you have proof? The two of you had a verbal agreement. As Judge Judy would say, \"don't pee on my leg and tell me it is raining\" (yes, I know people will get pissed for me quoting her).

He hired his twin brother, because he had been jobless for years with his nonsense study and he wanted to be kind. Then he hired his wife too, because she was also jobless. But BIL had this as a side thing. He also worked 40 hours a week, so he started it and it was mostly them who worked there. After a few years it didn't go well and he wanted to sell the company and they could work for the one who bought it. So BIL being kind said: you did so much work. Lets do it 50/50. We each get half of what he pays for the company. But no, his wife said she worked there so much (so did the other ppl he hired), so it had to be split 1/3 for BIL and 2/3 for them. BIL didn't want problems w his brother, who is also nice, but his wife is the boss, so BIL said okay. That's what you get for being friendly and wanting to help family.", "NTA.

So this hits close to home.  \n\nWhen you do a startup- you make a *cap table*, capitalization table.  It's a list of who owns how much of the company.  Different contributions can all have value.  For example let's say you're going to build a tourism resort-- one guy puts in a bunch of money, the other guy quits his day job and supervises all the construction.  The first person's contribution has an obvious dollar value.  The second guy's contribution does not.  You could take the average wage of a construction foreman times the amount of time he was there, or you could take whatever hourly rate he used to get paid at.  Or you could just agree on a percentage.  Point is, it can be whatever you want it to be.  \n\nHowever, if during that time you're also paying the dude a construction foreman's wage, what has he actually put in?  He's doing the same job he was before, and he's getting paid for the output.  Does he have any right to expect ownership of the business?  \nMost people would say no.  He's been paid to do a job.  **He hasn't actually INVESTED anything, not time nor money, so he doesn't get equity ownership.**  \n\nI would argue the same thing with your sister.  She's been *working* for $25/hr the whole time.  She hasn't invested a dime, nor has she worked for free.  Nothing of hers was risked.  So I see no reason why she deserves 1% equity let alone 50%.  \n\nNow, if she was doing work valued above $25/hr, the situation changes.  IE, if she was getting paid $25 for work that's worth $100, an argument should be made she deserves some equity because she was *investing* taking a low wage in the hope of future business success.  But this is the sort of thing you should **always negotiate in writing ahead of time!!!**.  \n\nHowever if you've put in way more time and money and hours than she, it sounds to me like she's expecting half a business to be handed to her.  And the fact that she won't accept minority ownership (IE, she needs decision making authority) is a red flag-- if she had the wisdom to make such decisions well she'd have asked for it earlier before she invested her time.  \n\nSo I say big NTA.", "Wow I wouldn\u2019t even give her more than 5% if she made no financial contribution to the business. She can have 10% if she worked for free and return all the salary you have already paid her. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister hasn't done much for the business and just wants to ride your coattails.  That is wrong.  \n\nTell her that her reaction makes you realize that you cannot be partners and you will employ her for six month stints, based on work performance.\n\nSounds like you've been giving into your sister's needs without really thinking about what you have built and input to make this business viable.  Your sister is merely an employee.  Employees don't get percentages of the business.\n\nIf she's willing to blow up your family over this, I'd let it happen...and don't employ her at all.", "NTA, doing basic work does not entitle her to ownership. Giving  her 10% is extremely generous. \n\nReally though, she doesn't add much value, and she seems very entitled,  better to give her nothing. Giving equity is easy, getting it back if there is a problem is not. \n\nMany businesses have been destroyed by giving ownership to the wrong person.", "The owner might die of laughter when hearing that outrageously ridiculous proposal!", "You got it wrong. Husband in no way supports 50/50 to keep the peace. That's what OP said. Husband said to calculate the actual contributions."]}
