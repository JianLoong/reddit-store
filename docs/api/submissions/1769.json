She had recently had a baby and was not planning on returning to work but still needed a little money. She asked if there was anything she could do to help the business and I said yes. Her responsibilities included answering some emails, organizing existing spreadsheets and reaching out to other business (which was her background, but none of the reaching out lead anywhere). She clocked about 5-8 hours of work per week and I paid her $25/hour. I still created the product for the client, answered follow up emails from the client, handled the financials and ran the social media and website. About a year in, we decided to do a \u201crebrand\u201d. We hired someone to make a new logo and I built a new website. About 5 months before the launch of the rebrand, she asked if we could \u201cget something in writing\u201d (an employment contract) and also expressed an interest in owning a part of the business. I told her we could definitely get something in writing and I would think about the part ownership. Three months later, I suggested a 70/30 split to which she disagreed. She said she was looking for a 50/50. I said I was definitely not comfortable with a 50/50 and the highest I would ever go would be 51/49. She responded with \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of being part owner when your decision would still be the final say. Again, I told her I would think about it. 2 weeks before the launch of the rebrand, I was talking to my husband and made the comment about having to give her 50% to keep the peace. He advised me to write down my financial contribution to the company vs hers. Obviously, the financial (let alone time commitment) was staggering. I presented her with a spreadsheet of tiers to buy into the company. 10% for free and then tiered payments all the way up to 49%. She was very angry saying that I had blindsided her, betrayed her and even went as far to say she built my business. I\u2019ve apologized for not bringing it up until the week before the launch, but she refuses to speak to me. She refuses to come to family thanksgiving or Christmas and it\u2019s tearing my family apart.", "created_utc": 1667888410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypd7gy/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_50_of_my_small/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was an employee. You paid her a wage to do a job. You have the financial interest in the company, if she hasn't invested her own money why does she think she's entitled to any form of ownership interest?", "70/30 was more than generous!\n\nWhy should she get 50% if she has not done 50% of the work? NTA.\n\nAnd not speaking to you is highly unprofessional. Imagine if she had 50% of the company and something didn't go her way. I'd advise you to give her exactly 0% of the company, and she should probably find employment somewhere else.", "NTA - 1) your company that you founded 2) nowhere had she talked about actually being a true shareholder with her money into the company. She's trying the old \"we're family\" perspective, when You're not, you're co-workers", "NTA Your sister is an entitled, manipulative asshole. DO NOT go through with part ownership, I can guarantee you this will not end well.\n\nDon't let her use that toxic \"but faaamily\" mentality to trick you into giving away half the business you created and worked hard for. 5-8 hours of work a week, for which she was paid a generous salary, and she thinks she built your business and should be gifted half of it?! This is absolute insanity!!!", "She isn't being professional in these negotiations. Are you sure that you would even like to own a company with her?", "YWBTA if you caved in to your sister's demands.\n\nHow did she go from doing a little work for 5-8 hours a week to thinking she was entitled to 50% of your business? At the very best she could get contract if she wishes to continue working for your business.\n\nNTA, OP. She thinks that just because she's your sister she's entitled to a part of what you own.", "NTA\n\nShe pulled 5-8 hours a week and was paid hourly.", "NTA, Honestly I'd email the documentation you made to any family members giving you grief.  \n\nYou should never be below 51% owner unless someone is flat out buying you out.  \n\nDepending on what you company is worth giving away some percentage because family, and because keeping the peace might make some sense.  But even then your company would have to be worth very little to even consider that.", "NTA. She was paid, and not unreasonably so.\n\nBut _WHY THE F*CK_ did you even entertain the idea of giving her a part of the business for nothing to start with? That's on you, you poisoned the well by not making sure that any such questions weren't met by immediate response question of what her contribution will be. Pretty sure you could hire plenty for $25/h for a few hours a week.", "NTA, she worked 8 hours a week and you employed her and paid her well. It is insane to think she should own any part. Your husband was very smart about having you list out the financial contributions, I would also write out the amount of time worked you put in versus her, then I would show her and any family interested the evidence. A 10% stake is a token of appreciation to your sister for her help, not really something she is owed at this point. Probably best to let her go with a nice severance package to keep the peace at this point though.", "NTA. Sis wants a free pass in life. Working 5-8hrs per WEEK and claiming she build the business. Little delusional there are we.", "NTA. She wants 50% of your company where she\u2019s an overpaid secretary but doesn\u2019t want to put any money into it? She is greedy and entitled. I\u2019d give her a 2 weeks notice of termination and keep my company. If the family wants to complain ask them if they want to give up 50% ownership of their home or car to the sister and her pay nothing because it\u2019s the same premise, except on your case she\u2019d be making money. That should shut them up.", "NTA, answering emails is not building a business. Don't give her anything. With that entitlement it will eventually kill your business and your relationship.", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds very entitled.\n\nYou hired her to help her out, and now she's entitled to half the company? That's some pretty ego-centric thinking there.", "NTA, she's just being greedy and manipulative. If she's not happy with your fair proposal let her start her own business. Also, this is generally why business and family/friends don't mix well. Might be better off going separate ways regardless and hope she gets over it eventually.", "NTA this is why we dont mix business with family. She is an employee you hired not a business partner .", "NTA she was basically trying to steal from you. You should probably let her go, she\u2019s not going to do good work for you now.", "Omg. NTA. Don\u2019t even entertain her drama. I don\u2019t know what kind of relationship you have but her entire shtick is BS. Honestly. \n\nIf I ever tried to pull this on my sibling, which I would never, they would quite literally laugh in my face. I\u2019d probably join in on the laugh. Your sister\u2019s a joke, she\u2019s either really that dumb and greedy, or really smart and manipulative. Please don\u2019t fall for it. \n\nYour idea of incremental percentage in ownership offset by how much she invests - financial, time and energy wise is more than fair. \n\nDo you guys have a history of you being a pushover, her stomping on boundaries or taking advantage of you?", "Your mistake was not saying no straight away. Is she expecting to continue doing less than 10hours of admin a week for 49% share? NTA", "NTA. \n\nI think you were far too generous to even suggest 49/51. She's being entitled and completely ridiculous.", "NTA. For many reasons but also, you can\u2019t own a business 50/50. It\u2019s always 51/49 for shared businesses", "NTA. Your sister wants that \u201centitled I am family, I deserve a cut\u201d of your business.  She was your employee.", "NTA. What makes her think she is entitled to something after only working a few hours a week and not investing her own money. She was compensated for her time. Tell her to go work those hours at another business and ask that owner for the same agreement. She'd get laughed out of the building. .....And she f*ng knows it.", "NTA, please, for the love of any higher power, do not agree to 50/50 ownership. If she's difficult now, think about how things will end up in the long run. At this point I wouldn't give any % of the business to her, if things go well, she'll take credit for it, like she does now, if by some reason business is slow, hits a though spot, temporarily, I'll let you guess who she'll blame. Besides, mixing business and family rarely goes well, this situation is a perfect example, you hired her, paid her for the job she's done and look at her entitlement.", "NTA. If she can\u2019t handle a single disagreement imagine how it will be once she owns any part of the business. She is clearly getting greedy with your success and is not entitled to any of it. You were very gracious offering 30%. If you weren\u2019t related and you weren\u2019t so nice, she wouldn\u2019t be going from employee to part-owner; she would be going from employee to unemployed.", "I am confused here. Why are you even offering 49%? Does she bring anything to the table except for the 'I am your sister' point? Does she add in any investment of money or expertise?", "NTA. You were incredibly generous to have initially offered *30 per cent*. It's your business, you started it and have done the majority of work in building it. She's lucky you're even offering 10 per cent for free. 5-8 hours a week? I spend that much time shitting in a week.", "NTA, but wow\u2026 the fact the you even CONSIDERED giving her any ownership, let alone 50/50, without considering upfront contributions (or really any details) shows you really need to step up your game as a business owner. You need to actually think about these kinds of things before making HUGE financial decisions", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or huge stuff like streamlining your inventory system to cut costs. Simple setting up an office and handling the administrative work isn't the same as building the buisness even noting how key that stuff is (which I think you generously covered by offering her 10% for free).", "NTA. Why are you giving her anything?? This makes no sense. Just because you\u2019re related to her doesn\u2019t give her a percentage. She was employed and paid a wage for her work. Barely a day a week on admin tasks isn\u2019t a significant contribution or anything to do with building a business.\n\nStand up for yourself - she either works as an employee or she finds other work. Stop apologising. A percentage isn\u2019t up for debate. It\u2019s not her business. \n\nShe wants to sulk and emotionally manipulate you? She can do that from home until she grows up.

Guarantee she slacks off once she got it. \n\nShe didn\u2019t build the business. You did. She didn\u2019t put any money into it, she took money from it.

Business isn't just about money, you have to be able to work together. Her rather odd views on how business ownership is determined would be massive red flags for me.

An employment contract is fair. Handing her half ownership (or even 30% ownership) is not fair. Since she's got neither sweat equity nor cash to put down, she's not earned it.

OP owns the business and hired the sister to do some jobs and paid them for that work in that sense its more of an employer and employee relationship between the two", "Oh, I am sure that relationship is long gone by now. The question is how to make sure sister doesn't succeed in poisoning the family now.", "Exactly, had this been anyone else asking for a share in the business, would OP have done this?\n\n\nNTA\n\nAnd if she feels this entitled, how will she be like if she gets a share?
