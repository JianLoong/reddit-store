She did nothing wrong here, you're just bitter that you have to be the one to disappoint him. Grow up.", "NTA but I don't think your ex has painted you into a corner, she is simply not able to get him up to Canada for his camping trip. My understanding is he probably asked her to make sure it was okay that he missed their vacation, and yeah she probably should've talked to you before Okaying it herself but it reads to me as \"yeah you can miss our vacation to go but I can't take you ask your dad if he can\" and now its up to you to decide whether or not you're able to take him. If you can't take him you can't take him he might be bummed but it is kind of last minute and no one would fault you for not dropping everything to take him to Canada .", "Sorry, but driving twelve hours twice over is no good at all, and your son has to face that reality.\n\nTrue, I don't see why he has to vacation with mother instead of with his GF, whom he obviously wants to get to know in a casual family setting. I've always been wary of parents imposing a vacation on kids who passionately do not want to spend time that way.\n\nBut twelve hours? Then another twelve hours? That's a family vacation in itself.\n\nCan't he take a plane? They have airports, etc. in Canada, don't they?", "Be the parent. Say no. It sucks, but it\u2019s what we do. \n\nYou can give your son the opportunity to plan something another time, but this plan with mom has been in place for a while. He\u2019s 15. While I do believe in giving teens more and more freedom as they get closer to 18, I also believe that it\u2019s important to teach them to honor commitment, and that life is going to have different moments where something seemingly better comes along. \n\nIn this case, his long distance girlfriend who lives in another country at their ages of 15 and 14 doesn\u2019t take precedence. This is not the age for that. This is not a teen drama show on free form.

Like- maybe you are willing to drive half way and his GF's family can drive half way. (I realize depending on where they live in Canada that could be an incredibly long drive for them but they made this invitation- the parents should have spoken with you before telling their daughter that she could invite your son.)\n\nMaybe he flies in- and GF's family picks him up- and you agree to cover half his flight but he has to work to cover the other half.

And I think I'd start by asking whether there's a plane that would get him most of the way (so you could drive him to the airport, and GF's family could pick him up from a Canadian airport).\n\nAnd yeah - if I was going to send my teenage kid off camping abroad with another family, I'd want to know that family, and have some confidence that they are sensible people.\n\nGF's family aren't assholes here - GF probably asked them \"can my US bf come camping with us?\" and they said \"sure - we have plenty of space, as long as he can get himself here\". Mom probably told the kid \"it's OK with me if you skip the holiday with me and go to Canada instead, but I can't get you there\". I'd call this mild AH behavior, because mom and dad should be discussing whether they'll let their kid travel out of the country, and not using the kid as an intermediary. Which leaves dad, who is allowed to not want to spend a solid day driving for each of the next two weekends, and is also allowed not to want his kid to camp abroad with people he's never met.\n\nSo I think NTA.

Had he been offered the invite earlier from his  girlfriend, it wouldn't be so rude.  \n\nHad the invite been made in a more timely manner, perhaps low cost options to get him there would have been feasible.\n\nSpell it out for him the difference in time and cost had the plans with the girlfriend been made earlier.\n\nAt this point, explain that it isn't feasible given the short notice.  If she lived maybe tops two hours away, it might be possible.  Cost and time commitment to get him there is not reasonable.\n\nI  would then give him the option of going with his Mom and sister as planned or stay with you but that vacationing with his GF is not feasible.\n\nMy two cents.", "NTA\n\nyou'll never convince him", "How hard is it to tell a 15yo that this is too short notice so it's not gonna happen?

It's the parents of a 14 year old inviting a boyfriend they hardly know on vacation. They should be encouraging their child to grow as an individual at that age, not latch onto a boyfriend. I'm not against high school freshmen dating, but there are reasonable, age-appropriate limits.

That's why I said age-appropriate  limits. There is a difference between seeing a movie or hanging out for a few hours on a weekend and an entire week isolated camping. The 14 year old shouldn't be put in the situation to accommodate a bf for multiple days without being able to walk away. Because accommodating is generally what teenage girls do instead of standing for their own interests. It's the wrong lesson to teach.\n\nShort dates where the parents can step in after and ask \"did you have fun, did he (or she, we can flip this scenario) make you feel good about yourself, are you comfortable being alone with him etc.\" are important to teach kids to expect to be treated with respect in relationships.\n\nI had too many high school classmates with parents that only cared that their kids had a boyfriend/girlfriend - almost like a status symbol for the parent. Those kids ended up divorced before 25 or pressured to stay in abusive relationships. I'll count my cousin as one of those parents too.

If she was encouraging about him going and implied it was reasonable for you to take him, that would be an asshole move. But it easily could have been something like her telling him there was no way she could take him, and him asking if he could go if you agreed, and she said that wasn't likely but that she wouldn't stop it. \n\nBut also, you need to own your own decisions, and you can own your no without taking on guilt then blaming that guilt on other people. Just say no and mean it.", "NTA, but your son will not have a good time in Florida, and likely neither will anyone else if you force him to go.", "NTA. Kids gotta learn they can't always do what they want, arrangements have already been made.", "NTA \nHe is too young to go camping with his girlfriend's family in another country for a week. And this is coming from someone who was doing international travel for festivals by herself at 17.\n\nHave you met the parents? \n\nI myself would draw a hard age line of 16 for crossing borders for vacations without parents. It might only be a year older, but the line has got to be drawn somewhere.", "NAH.\n\n2016 is 7 years ago, her wanting all the time she could get then with an 8 year old kid has zero bearing on her being willing to give up a week with a 15 year old when the 15 year old asked. \n\nOf course 15 wants last minute logistical miracles to hang out with his girlfriend! Super normal! So is disappointment when your parents don\u2019t creat said miracle.\n\nDriving for 12 hours for the next two weekends sounds horrible and you don\u2019t have to do it. Refusing to give up your next two weekends to produce a logistical miracle for your kid does not make you an AH. \n\nHowever, if you want to sit down with your kid and try to come up with a solution other than you driving all the way twice, that would be really great. At least talk to the girlfriend\u2019s parents about ways to get the kids together in the future. Teenage long distance sucks. If camping this time doesn\u2019t work out, maybe a spring break trip? Can he go up for Canadian thanksgiving and she come down for the American one?", "Ex-wife should have talked to Dad BEFORE she told the kid it was fine with her.", "No . She said he can go but she won\u2019t drive him. Dad can say exactly the same thing.", "Yeah but 14 isn't old enough to bring a bf on a family vacation. Yes they are old enough to behave, but vacationing together is pushing the relationship into more mature territory than is appropriate. That's basically teaching your kid that you should always be with your bf. Feels kinda stifling really. I've known people whose parents did this, and they all did get very codependent in their relationships.\n\nHealthy relationships allow, even encourage you to carve out your own time, for yourself, with your family, etc. Even married people don't spend every waking moment together.\n\nA better way to handle this would be to give your kid some money so they can buy their bf a souvenir or something, set aside some phone/computer time for them, etc. That way, they get to have their relationship, but still get family time too.", "NTA, no that's absurd. \n\n6 hours is absolutely unreasonable to expects someone to chauffer anyone anywhere. Forget the short notice! I can't even imagine asking my parents to do that when I was a kid at all. I would have been laughed out of the room.\n\nIf he wants to take a trip like that, he can let you know WELL in advance and you can work with him to save the money TO FLY.\n\nThis isn't you being the bad guy by saying no. This is him being totally ridiculous by even asking.\n\nOooh it's *so* easy for mom to say she \"doesn't have a problem with him going\", but fuck her for getting his hopes up instead of telling him he was being unreasonable to ask.", "\"You can go if Mom wants to take you.\"\n\nNTA", "That just puts the kid in limbo. Dad is being good by giving the kid a definitive yes/no.", "No, I won\u2019t drive you to another country.\nThat\u2019s pretty definitive.", "Exactly, which makes dad the bad guy who says no, which is the corner OP is talking about.", "NTA\n\nYou don't even know these people. Your son doesn't even know these people. Not going on vacation knowing people.\n\nPlus, what happens if something goes wrong? Do you have international traveler's medical insurance for your son? That family isn't going to the legal authority to authorize medical care.\n\nAbsolutely not.", "Info: would your ex be in Florida while your son is on the Canada trip?", "NTA. It sucks that your ex painted you into this corner. A 12 hour drive each weekend is too much, imho.", "Nah, he'd probably end up knocking her up on accident anyways.\n\nChildren need supervision or they make dumb mistakes.", "Exactly.", "ESH except for the 17 year old sister. YTA for being too afraid to say no, I would\u2019ve never asked such a thing my parents would\u2019ve laughed in my face. Your son by even thinking this is ok to bail on plans and thinking you\u2019ll drive 24hrs in a week for him. Your ex wife for not caring if he goes on vacation and also telling him no while accommodations and tickets are presumably already set? Like what in the world", "Right? My parents told me no a lot, like it happens. But no way would I have ever asked for what OPs kid is asking for.", "I mean it\u2019s Canada, they are nice", "Why are parents so scared to tell their kids \u201cno\u201d these days?", "Or they're teaching her that the people she brings home will be treated kindly and welcomed into the family fold, so she'll always feel comfortable introducing them to her dates, won't feel the need to hide relationships from them, and they'll have a good chance of always knowing where she's at in her development and what's going on with her social life so they can keep her safe.\n\nWhat awful parents."]}
