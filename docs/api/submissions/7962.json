If you don\u2019t want dye, then you don\u2019t have dye. End of story. Hugs though for the shitty situation.", "That sounds so cool tho? May sounds like a jerk. NTA.", "NTA. \n\ncontrary to popular belief,  just because it's her wedding,  it doesn't mean she can make her guests (yes, even bridesmaids) do whatever she wants.\n\nand on a side note, these ridiculous rules and demands really get out of control. is this a US thing?", "NTA, but your brother and SIL are huge AH. I would skip the wwedding of these people w/o notice.", "Yesterday I read a really good comment: \"maybe she should hire an actor\" NTA", "NTA It\u2019s literally a birthmark. Imagine if you had one on your face and she demanded you cover it up because she doesn\u2019t like looking at it. That would be horrible. Besides, the white streak in otherwise dark hair is so cool.", "NTA - asking someone to alter their appearance, especially if it has risks like chemical burns, is an AH move. Also having dark hair with one streak of white sounds cool as heck and probably looks awesome.", "NTA, but if you ever feel like having a patch of coloured hair, maybe give vegan dye a shot? I have a sensitive scalp and it works a lot better for me. That's if you want to", "NTA \nYou /could/ compromise by seeing if one of those wash out hair coloring spray stuff but honestly you shouldn't have to. That is what you look like and as it's been stated in other comments- they knew you had this hair when they asked you to be in the wedding. \n\nThis is the spray stuff I'm talking about- I used it for Halloween as a kid \nhttps://www.partycity.com/black-hair-spray-182049.html", "Bodily autonomy is the most important part of this conversation, but I want to add it's also her natural hair color! It's not even like she chooses to dye it rainbows (like I do, because bright colored hair is awesome too) or something crazy that will clash with the dresses, it's WHITE. As neutral as it gets. NTA", "Here we go again. Why do brides feel so entitled? I\u2019m going to steal something I just read on another post today. I think it was like:\nIf they want you to act/play a part, then they should hire actors.", "Exactly what r/PommieGirl said, don't dye your hair for anyone but yourself!!! Of course there is hair chalk in bright pink, or purple, or blue you may enjoy. Or spray in hair colors in green, turquoise, lavender, etc ....I'm petty and I love purple so I know what I'd choose just to watch her face. Stay true to your ideals and do not get bullied into doing something you don't want to do especially since real hair dye gives you a chemical burn and rash.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Plus temporary dyes sometimes don\u2019t come out.", "Ooh I love this idea. \n\nNext family dinner, turn up with exactly half your hair bleached white to match the streak :-)", "My friend has this condition and it looks awesome - maybe she\u2019s also jealous OP will steal a bit of thunder\u2026", "NTA. I'd be pulling out anyway over the language she used to describe your white streak", "OP dodged a bullet here. Go ahead and get uninvited- you don\u2019t want these people\u2019s slime on you anyway. Yuck!", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t want to be in the wedding of people with that type audacity. What an ugly thing to demand.", "exactly -  a friend of mine has super smooth silky hair..   very light blonde.\n\nAny dye she puts into it just sticks.  It's weird.\n\nWe used the exact same temporary dye together years ago..  mine washed out in a week or so and hers actually had to grow out.", "Exactly.\nDear OP, next time Mary comes to your house ask her when she is going to get \"that thing\" covered.
