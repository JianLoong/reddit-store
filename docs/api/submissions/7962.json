If you are considering coloring it for the wedding my suggestion is this: Contact a reputable salon in your area and explain the situation. Ask if they will do a patch test for both permanent and semipermanent hair color. This test is normally done behind the ear and if there is a reaction it would be on a very small spot and not your whole head. Plus, it won\u2019t involve any hair so no changes there. Make a decision based on those results.\n\nKeep in mind too that white hair has no pigment in it and may not even accept artificial hair color because the interior structure of the hair shaft may be missing the bonds that the hair color alters so the color has nothing to adhere to. You could also ask for an off the scalp test in one small spot to see if it will even cover but there are no guarantees.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s your hair.
