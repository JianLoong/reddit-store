Even my mechanic said he was thrilled to have the business but if I\u2019m bringing my car into the shop every week than it\u2019s not a car worth owning. \n\nIt was at this time that I decided to sell the car.

I didn\u2019t even want to have that car sitting in my parking spot if I couldn\u2019t drive it or fix it. \n\nSo I called one of those \u201cwe buy scrap cars\u201d places. The kind where they send a flat bed to your location and take the car and pay you a few hundred bucks just to take the thing off your hands. I was offered $300 to have my car taken from me that day. \n\nAs this was going down, my GF told her mom that I was selling my car for $300. She got all hyped up and said they needed a new car for their farm and if I was going to just get rid of it to a random for $300, then I should just sell it to her for the $300 instead. \n\nI thought sure whatever. I don\u2019t care who gets the car as long as I get my $300. So I delayed the scrap car guy and told GFs mom to come over and she could buy the car for $300. \n\nGFs mom came over with $100. Said she could get the rest the next day. I said no deal. I start getting called a cheap prick and that I don\u2019t trust her to pay me back. I said can you do an e transfer for the remaining $200 and she said she didn\u2019t have the money in her account. I said $300 for a Toyota Camry that still runs is a steal. If you don\u2019t have the money right now I\u2019m not gonna wait for it. I\u2019ll just sell it to the scrapper and be done with it. So that\u2019s what I did. \n\nGfs mom is extremely upset that \u201cI don\u2019t trust her\u201d and \u201ci couldn\u2019t just wait a day with the car for her\u201d\n\nI wanted that car out of my life forever THAT DAY. that\u2019s why I sold it so cheap to begin with.

Edit: typos", "NTA, you were set on selling it. The mother could have easily called you and said hey I don\u2019t have the money right now but I will later on. She didn\u2019t do that, she came over with less than the agreed upon amount and thought you would just take it. She probably was expecting you to accept the $100 then guilt trip and manipulate you into letting the other $200 go since she\u2019s your girlfriend\u2019s mother.", "NTA.  It sounds like you did not trust that she would get the money.  She's not family, so you do not owe her.  However, if you are planning to marry your gf, you may want to rethink this.", "NTA and im sure you already had the idea that you wouldnt see the rest of the money. You dont show up with less than what was agreed upon. The car also had a plethora of issues according to you and unless you disclosed that and made her aware, she wouldve complained the moment something happened as well. What you do with your car is your own business.", "NTA You did the right thing. Chances are you\u2019d never have seen the other $200 if you\u2019d given her the car for $100 with a promise to pay the rest someday when she didn\u2019t even have the money in her back account.", "NTA. \nI really don\u2019t care what your reasons are. You\u2019re selling the car. If someone wants to buy it, they need to come with the full price. \n\nThe hustle was on the moment she showed up with $100. If she really needed an extra day, she would\u2019ve just texted you that she needed an extra day.\n\nAssuming that this woman raised your girlfriend, you might have some problems down the road. Keep an eye on your GF.", "NTA.  If she doesn't have the money today she's not going to have it tomorrow.  She's trying to get something for nothing from you cuz she's your gf's mom and assumes she can take advantage of you.  What else is she going to demand if you start this.\n\nEdit - spelling", "NTA\n\nBut you are in a relationship with this woman's daughter.\n\nWhat you did will probably effect your relationship and not in a good way. That said I think whatever you did would have effected your relationship.\n\nLook how quick this woman started calling you a cheap prick. The second the car broke down she would have blamed you.", "NTA\n\nYou told her the price, she agreed, then she came back with less than the amount.\n\nIf she had any intention of actually paying three hundred dollars, she'd have been honest and VOLUNTEERED that info rather than show up with a hundred and tried to manipulate and insult you for giving it to her practically free. People do this all the time, esp on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace meetups. \n\n\"Yeah, listen I have a hundred on me now, and I'll give you the other two hundred when I get paid, can you work with me?\" is not a hard sentence to utter. To show up with the intent of changing the price, no matter what stories she told you, was dishonest.\n\nI did something like that on Ebay years ago. Not to ask for a reduction in price. Because of a hurricane, when we lost our roof, my daughter's toys were badly damaged, from a specific theme. A seller was offering a huge lot of the EXACT toys we lost. I asked up front for her to take the sale down, and allow me to buy them the first week of the next month, full asking price, no bidding. She was lovely and we had a nice chat, and it worked out great. People will work with you if you can have a decent conversation like a normal and honest human being. \n\nIf gf mom had asked to take the car and make payments, and make an informal written contract, this would not be an issue, I'm sure.\n\nOP, you did the right thing. She'd have disappeared with the car, stiffed you, then threatened to sue the minute it started needing repairs again. If gf disagrees, knowing all the facts, you might want to start pulling away.", "I mean...yes, she should have been forthcoming about needing an additional day to get the money before she came over, but I think the question you should really have asked yourself is whether having the car gone THAT DAY was worth alienating your in-laws over.", "ESH. She should have showed up with the full amount, or communicated to you sooner that it would be a couple of days to get you the amount.\n\nYTA because it sounds like leaving it in the parking spot till she could get the full amount would have had 0 impact on your life, other than you wanted it out of your life THAT DAY. \n\nQuestion: Do you dislike your GFs mom?

Or the next day when she had all the money?", "Soft YTA\u2026\n\nYou could have waited a day and that would have been much better for your relationship.\n\nBut\u2026 a $300 car that needs continual repairs should not go to someone who doesn\u2019t have $300. You would have just been the bad person within a month for selling them a defective car. \n\nSo, I agree with the ultimate action but I think you could have handled it better.", "YTA. It\u2019s your girlfriend\u2019s mother. One day. You couldn\u2019t wait one day so you blew up your relationship with your girlfriend\u2019s mom.", "YTA are you really that impatient you can\u2019t wait a day?

I gave an old shit car with some MOT away once and it broke down and died a few months later as I warned it would, and the choosing beggar moaned how I'd cost them money because they had to pay a 25 pound admin fee to the insurance company.

If you can't afford the upkeep on a car, you can't afford the car.\n\nAnd the mom could do neither", "Their point is if she really didnt have the money, she shouldve said so on the phone. Saying you wanna buy something and then bringing a low amount is a common craigslist scam.", "Good. For him.", "This!", "Exactly, not being kind is what makes OP an asshole.

If you can't guarantee OP is getting paid in full, then your entire comment is based on a faulty assumption.\n\nBTW, I agree with OP. The chances of him getting paid in full are slim and none. The mom is not going to be suddenly $200 richer tomorrow. She didn't explain to OP where the money is going to come from in the next 24-hours. She is almost certainly lying, and there is going to be a parade of never-ending excuses as to why she can't pay OP.", "\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\ude01", "They didn't ask for a favor.

This is just the way I feel about it.I just don't think the GF would have brought this to her mom if she knew her mother would flake out on the payment but you are correct, I absolutely can't guarantee he would have received the rest of the money.\n\nOn the topic of faulty assumptions though: from the way OP describes the situation it doesn't seem like this happened yesterday/today or even that recently. He described that his position got moved to be WFH \"in the midst of the pandemic\" so my guess is this is an older issue. Meaning we dont really have a means of knowing on which day of the week/month this happened on.", "Personally I think ESH. \n\nFamily shouldn't have assumed he'd be okay with it and should have told him ahead of time about not having all the cash.\n\nOP had the car for eight years and suddenly needed it gone that day? Starting a conflict with a girlfriend's family over $200? Not good choices either."]}
