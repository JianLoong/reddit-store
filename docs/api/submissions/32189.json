I called her and politely told her that her reaction bothered me. I am open to her help, but I would appreciate it if she didn't treat me like a child. She got mad, called me a name she knows I hate, and hung up on me. I called her the next day to resolve it and she didn't pick up or call me back.\n\nI let it be. The couple of times we saw each other after, I didn't bring it up and carried on civilly with her. But then I had the baby and she ghosted me. No call, no text, no congratulations. I didn't hear from her for months.\n\nMy kid was nine months old before we ended up in the same room again, and by then, I wasn't interested in pretending like everything was fine because people were watching. I didn't say a word to her.\n\nFast-forward to now, I found out she's pregnant with a girl and engaged. I did not find this out from her. Our father had to text me. I decided to call and congratulate her, and that's how I found out she blocked my number.\n\nHonestly, I am not interested in this mess anymore. Even I know how ridiculous this whole situation is. A blow-up over a crib for my kid. A friend says my sister was just hurt because she wanted to help me and I wouldn't let her. And it was that \"hurt\" that kept her from calling or texting after the baby was born. She claims I need to be the bigger person, or I won't be in my niece's life.\n\nAt this point, I accept that. My family has always been a toxic mess, but no one ever saw that because I was the scapegoat. I was the one with the problem and making the problems, and nothing would ever be wrong if it wasn't for me. Exactly like what is happening now.

I have no time for that passive aggressive stuff. I consider what she did that.", "NTA if you decline taking the high road and refuse to speak of it further. If others get involved, just say it\u2019s between you and your\nsister and they need to mind their own business. Just be low drama about it.\n\nYour sister sounds like a piece of work. It probably won\u2019t be her only wedding so maybe things will be better in a couple years for wedding number two or three.", "NTA. Live your life and focus on loving your sweet baby. You did nothing wrong. Your sister took her sweet @$$ time and you were nesting. As for your friend? You don\u2019t need that kind of negativity.  Ugh.", "Babe. Be petty. Hang onto that resentment. Let thy cup overfloweth with their tears.\n\nYou don't seem to be missing out on anything by not being on good terms with them.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all, but it is definitely important you make this call w both eyes wide open. That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re gonna say & it\u2019ll likely devolve more. Are you ok w having a problem w your dad & stepmom? Are you ok w possibly having to cut them out? If you\u2019re good w that (I think I would be, based on what you\u2019ve shared), then don\u2019t go and no you\u2019re NTA for that. But if you\u2019re not ok w that being the probable outcome, maybe now\u2019s not the time to take that stand. \n\nIt really is your call & you\u2019re not at all the AH, but there\u2019s gonna be an outcome from deciding not to go and I hope you\u2019re aware & ready for it, otherwise it\u2019s just gonna hurt you more than going would have.", "Here's the thing. YOu're going to get blamed. It doesn't matter what you do. You will always and forever get blamed because that's apparently your role in the family. So knowing that, why would it matter what the fuel is or that she has any? You need to cut contact, live happily, and gray rock them all as much as possible. Don't give them free rent in your head or heart, and don't waste your energy on them. I would block her number so you know she can't reach out, and then ignore the invite. NTA", "She will always gaslight; this is just the current phase. Is it worth it? Sorry you have always had to be the scapegoat and peacemaker - this will never end and they won\u2019t change. Be happy and congrats on the baby. I would send a nice gift and be done with it - She\u2019s not worth anything more, but you are. Also, your friend sucks.", "Nope\u2026NTA for doing so. It is an invitation, not a subpoena.", "And your friends seems a little obtuse. It\u2019s either she doesn\u2019t know your family and can\u2019t empathize or she does and is one of those people who thinks family is family no matter how they\u2019ve hurt you.\nEither way she didn\u2019t even try to see your side or how your sister hurt you.\nA month is enough time to put together a crib especially if your sister was begging you to do it. And a sorry would have sufficed when she didn\u2019t.\nYou didn\u2019t refuse to let her help especially since you called multiple times to get it set up during the month.\nThose people don\u2019t deserve to be in your life.", "Your friend is viewing the situation through a normal lens, though, rather than a toxic/dysfunctional one. The lens matters, and people who have always had functional relationships can't fathom the realities of dysfunctional ones.\n\nYour friend is just projecting what she *thinks* your sister was feeling. The only one who can say for sure is your sister, and she chose not to speak to you about it. Your friend has no more information than you do at this point.", "You're not letting anything go on.  You TRIED to reach out to your sister, but she blocked you. The ball is now in her court.\n\nYour friend is in the wrong her.  Is she also friends with your sister?", "I have had some very toxic encounters with my family and the best advice I can give...do what is best for you. Consider you first. Everyone is telling you to put others ahead of yourself. Are they? When have you come first? Your happiness, your wellbeing? Do it now, whatever it is because you deserve the best.", "If your sister were actually \u201cexcited to be with\u201d you and wanted to \u201cbe there for the baby\u201d, then she would have *been excited to be with you and been there for the baby.* You did not create this drama, you did your best to resolve the situation that your sister caused, and the fact that she is continuing to behave like a petulant child is not your fault. Separate yourself from these negative people (\u201cfriend\u201d included), and move on with your life.", "Your friend doesn't know your sister, she's thinking of her as a regular person, not a narcissist. Your sister set you up. She expects you to come crawling back.\n\nYou need to think long and hard if you want to teach your baby it is okay to let yourself be treated by this. Or whether you should tell your father you have reached your limit and you will no longer be the only one to make the effort. A wedding invite isn't welcome without her apology and effort on her part well before the day.", "NTA.  You get treated like you let other people treat you.  You've had enough of your family's b.s.  Like you said if you would only do this, everything would be ok.  Well it's not ok to treat you like everything is your fault, especially when it isn't.  Sounds like you'd be better off without them.  She blocked you, that message is pretty clear.  Move on without all this b.s. drama.", "You are not letting the conflict go on, you are refusing to engage in it. That\u2019s different. Frankly, you\u2019re better off without your sister and \u201cfriend\u201d. Don\u2019t bother going to the wedding or anything thing else related to her. She made her choice. Focus on yourself and your baby.\n\nNTA", "That\u2019s a very smart idea. Move to the other side of the country and start over with new friends and the family you have made. Sometimes a fresh start is the only way to truly break free from the toxicity of a dysfunctional family. I wish you all the best of luck and please keep us posted! Also, spend the wedding day with your family, maybe go on a weekend trip and check in to a nice hotel, book a massage and just enjoy yourself.", "Here's the thing: *maybe* she forgot, or was busy, or you could have asked her for a date she could put the crib together before doing it yourself. We don't know. (Honestly, she should have been an adult and followed through, but stuff happens.) \n\nEither way, at this point, she's a complete asshole now. Whatever happened then, it doesn't matter. Like you said, even you know how stupid this is at this point and you have better things to do than clean up other people's messes that aren't your kid's. Congratulations on your baby, let the rest of them kick rocks.", "Get a better friend...cause she is TA and so is your sister. You've tried to reach out, you're blocked. As far as I would be concerned, it's over. Don't let this BS live rent-free in your head.", "I already commented but I'm just going to add that my fiance moved across the country for me and it also meant moving away from his 2 toxic sisters. It was hard for him to move away from where he grew up, but it's been so much better for his mental health.", "Your friend is an Ah too. Just how much time were you supposed to wait  until your kid reached 18 years?! NTA and Ignore your ah friend and distance yourself and your child from toxic ah's like those in your family.", "If that \"friend\" is also your sister's friend, she's no friend of yours. Your sister needs you to be the scapegoat and will not tolerate a friend who defends you. Lose them both.\n\nIf people ask, you can say vaguely that you and your sister have drifted apart over the years. There's no need to mention the crowbar and other tools she's used to widen the split. \n\nLet it go, let her go, let the friend go, and leave them all behind. You have a good life ahead of you.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f this is not normal and should not be viewed as such", "A lot of commentary is telling you to decline (which is appropriate), but if asked and challenged about being a bigger person, then UNO card and tell them to expect adult relationships and relay that a apology to you is expected.  And if they persist - they can apologize for not valuing your sense of worth against abuse.\n\nStay strong", "Are you Cindarella?? I think you should politely say that you won't come to the wedding. It doesn't sound like she really wants you there either, so that should be a Nice wedding gift."]}
