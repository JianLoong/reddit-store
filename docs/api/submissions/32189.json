But then the crib arrived and sat in my entryway for a month, with no ETA on when she was coming to help me. So I put the crib together myself.\n\nMy sister got very mad about this and made a fuss. I called her and politely told her that her reaction bothered me. I am open to her help, but I would appreciate it if she didn't treat me like a child. She got mad, called me a name she knows I hate, and hung up on me. I called her the next day to resolve it and she didn't pick up or call me back.\n\nI let it be. The couple of times we saw each other after, I didn't bring it up and carried on civilly with her. But then I had the baby and she ghosted me. No call, no text, no congratulations. I didn't hear from her for months.\n\nMy kid was nine months old before we ended up in the same room again, and by then, I wasn't interested in pretending like everything was fine because people were watching. I didn't say a word to her.\n\nFast-forward to now, I found out she's pregnant with a girl and engaged. I did not find this out from her. Our father had to text me. I decided to call and congratulate her, and that's how I found out she blocked my number.\n\nHonestly, I am not interested in this mess anymore. Even I know how ridiculous this whole situation is. A blow-up over a crib for my kid. A friend says my sister was just hurt because she wanted to help me and I wouldn't let her. And it was that \"hurt\" that kept her from calling or texting after the baby was born. She claims I need to be the bigger person, or I won't be in my niece's life.\n\nAt this point, I accept that. My family has always been a toxic mess, but no one ever saw that because I was the scapegoat. I was the one with the problem and making the problems, and nothing would ever be wrong if it wasn't for me. Exactly like what is happening now. There wouldn't be an issue if I had \"just let her help me and put together the crib.\" \n\nI'm tired of it. I know they're (my sister and stepmom) going to invite me to the wedding, because my father will make sure they do, but I will not go without a sincere apology from her. I tried to make it up to her, despite doing nothing wrong, and got nothing but the silent treatment at every turn. I have no interest in going to the wedding so we can keep up the facade of being a happy family. \n\nBut if I don't go, it's just more fuel for her, and more proof that I'm \"resentful,\" \"not letting it go.\" and \"the problem.\"\n\nWIBTAH if I toss that invite in the trash?", "created_utc": 1701522710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1893g0f/wibta_if_i_dont_go_to_the_wedding/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First off this whole crib situation is ridiculous. You gave her a month, she didn\u2019t do it so you did. Disappointing but honestly could be water under the bridge.

You might not be invited to this wedding, despite the fact you are sure that your father will be mad if she doesn't invite you.

Still, why would you go to a wedding to which, if you are invited, you know you are being thought about only because another person has forced the bride to invite you?

You owe her nothing. If anyone asks tell them the truth she offered them a month later said nothing and got mad and I'm not feeding into anymore and don't care how you or anyone else feels about it.", "NTA. Don't go.

Heck I\u2019d throw it in a fire. I would burn that bridge.", "NTA. My half sister and I haven't spoken in more than a decade for similar seasons. She didn't even bother a text when I got cancer and had to endure 8 months of chemo and multiple surgeries. F her and F your sister.", "NTA, but honestly why would you want to go if you know it wouldn't be a sincere invite anyway? If she only invites you because \"your dad makes her\" she clearly doesn't really want you there.", "NTA. Why would you go to the wedding of anyone who hasn\u2019t spoken to you in months/years and has your number blocked. Tell your dad it\u2019s not necessary to force the invitation from them and that you\u2019re fine not attending since you have no relationship with her anymore. Remove yourself from that toxic environment and if you\u2019re not in it you won\u2019t hear their complaints, so it just won\u2019t matter.", "NTA. Don't expect an apology, and don't engage with her. It was ridiculous of her to be mad about the crib. You had it for a month with no sign of when she would come assemble it. Besides, what a ridiculous thing to get angry about. She can decide on her own when she wants to reconcile. You've done what you could, and now you should just go peacefully on with your life.", "NTA.\n\nYou tried. You went above and beyond in your attempts to patch things up. She\u2019s not interested, and there is nothing you can do about that. You can\u2019t go back in time and change the decision you made to put together a crib without her. And I think you both know that this estrangement is not *actually* about a renegade crib assembly. \n\nYou have no reason to believe that your sister would actually want you at her wedding, and until you hear otherwise from her, I\u2019d assume she\u2019d be happier if you stayed home. Dad can whine and beg all he wants, but it\u2019s not his wedding, so it\u2019s not his call. Simple as that.", "I don't think my sister will change or wants to, but my friend made me feel so terrible. She claimed my sister was just hurt because she was excited to help me and be there for the baby, but I refused her. She said at this point I'm letting the conflict go on, and if I keep holding on to anger, it will affect my ability to be a good mother. It'll also harm my kid's chance of having a family, or a relationship with her cousin.\n\nLike I said, I am somehow always the problem. Before that conversation and finding out I was blocked, I was considering moving out of the country. Now I know I'm moving. I'll never escape this toxicity as long as I'm near it. If it's not my parents or sister making me feel bad, it's others doing it on their behalf.", "It\u2019s never \u201cjust the crib\u201d. \n\nOP said she was the family scapegoat. The crib was an excuse.", "Oh, they\u2019ll invite her. Can\u2019t turn down an opportunity to get a gift from somebody now can we?", "I was being dramatic. I will politely RSVP no, then I'll throw it in the trash.", "Reddit is helping a lot, actually. It helps to get an outside perspective on the situation since every day there's something new. I feel staying NC is best, even if it means I won't know my neice. This thread helped confirm that.", "Your friend doesn't sound like a good person, or just doesn't understand your family dynamic. Or if they know about it, doesn't sound like they fully Believe it. You know your family better than anyone, you're NTA. Protect your peace.", "NTA\n\nBut get better friends.", "Does your friend not know the situation or does she know something you don't? A crib sitting there unbuilt for a month isn't a \"refusal\" of your sister's help - it's her not helping. Then your sister gets upset and basically blocks you because she didn't help to set up a crib for your child? That's ridiculous.", "This person is not your friend.", "Is your friend also an asshole", "Your friend is an idiot. Truly, dump them.", "Yes. I don't think it's about the crib. It's because I called her the day after she blew up on me and told her I didn't appreciate how she spoke to me, and that she needed to stop treating me like a child.\n\nMy sister isn't used to being corrected. She proudly calls herself a princess and I'm not joking.\n\nGrowing up, she would go into my room and help herself to whatever she wanted. If I complained, my stepmother scolded me for being selfish and not sharing. She never had chores, that was all on me. If my dad did tell her to do something, my stepmother went behind his back and told me to do it myself. Whenever she did something wrong, it was my fault for \"setting a bad example.\" \n\nShe was never held accountable. So me calling her out when she was \"trying to help me\" did not go over well. Even so, I can't believe she's taken it this far. At this point, I've lost any interest in a relationship with her."]}
