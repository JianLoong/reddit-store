How many did you disturb when you got up to chase down the management?", "Just curious, me being older than dirt, is it the light or the fact that it is light from a phone.", "Wtf are you on about?

Because the theatres turn the lights completely off, the only light that is usually seen come from the screen, the emergency exit sign and the lighting on the steps. Your eyes can adjust to that because it's constant and not too bright.\n\nBut when someone is texting, their phone screen will light up at random times, it's not a constant brightness. So when you're immersed in a film in the dark and you see something catch your eye either in the peripheral or in front of you, it breaks your immersion. Regardless if it's only for a second, it's distracting enough, and if it's happening often enough, it gets annoying.\n\nMaybe not the worst thing to do, but there's a reason why they clearly state before each film to turn your phones off. That's literally the rule in most theatres for a reason. \n\nI say this because I go to the movies often and every other film I've seen, there's been that one person to bring out their phone during the film more than once and it's caught my attention, and I'm sure it catches other people's attention as well.\n\nMaybe it's not distracting to some, but it IS distracting to others in some capacity.", "You just said ten other people could hear you.", "If the OP says it was a typo, then I will accept that.", "I agree they should not be using their phone and is against the rules.", "No I didn\u2019t.
