Because the theatres turn the lights completely off, the only light that is usually seen come from the screen, the emergency exit sign and the lighting on the steps. Your eyes can adjust to that because it's constant and not too bright.\n\nBut when someone is texting, their phone screen will light up at random times, it's not a constant brightness. So when you're immersed in a film in the dark and you see something catch your eye either in the peripheral or in front of you, it breaks your immersion. Regardless if it's only for a second, it's distracting enough, and if it's happening often enough, it gets annoying.\n\nMaybe not the worst thing to do, but there's a reason why they clearly state before each film to turn your phones off. That's literally the rule in most theatres for a reason. \n\nI say this because I go to the movies often and every other film I've seen, there's been that one person to bring out their phone during the film more than once and it's caught my attention, and I'm sure it catches other people's attention as well.\n\nMaybe it's not distracting to some, but it IS distracting to others in some capacity.", "You just said ten other people could hear you.", "If the OP says it was a typo, then I will accept that.", "I agree they should not be using their phone and is against the rules.", "No I didn\u2019t.

Not by a long shot. The couple was rude and inconsiderate AF. The management team is lousy as well. As a frequent movie goer I feel ya. Doesn't matter how low the brightness setting is on a cell phone, in a movie theater it's like a lighthouse. You can't help being distracted by it. Personally I say time to brush off your writing skills and complain to the theater company, you may be able to at least get a refund or free passes out of it. If you have the theater manager's name be sure to use it.", "NTA people like this have no home training. If you can\u2019t sit through a movie and not be on your phone then stay at home.", "NTA As long as you aren't yelling at them like a lunatic, you should always tell these people off", "NTA\n\nHate people like that.", "NTA, you are a lot nicer then I would have been; honestly you probably should have been meaner, people like this do not learn until they are put in their place, they have no right to ruin the movie experience for everyone else around them and if they want to spend the time texting instead of watching the movie they should have stayed home. I\u2019d have also requested a refund from the theater and if they wouldn\u2019t give it back charge on the credit card, if this isn\u2019t made right someone needs to pay (cash wise).", " NTA. Going out to the movies is expensive. It should be treated with some dignity.", "NTA and those people should never be going out to a theater if they can't stop using their phones. Seriously WTF they pay $20 per person tovgo out and spend it looking at their phones? GTFO\n\nStuff like this is why I miss having Alamo Drafthouse around me. They don't mess around and they WILL kick you out for doing things like this.", "Dude, if it was just the texting, I would say try to ignore it (even though everything you\u2019re saying is 100% true.) But then they are PUTTING THE PHONE UP to record the screen? Good gravy that\u2019s obnoxious!", "I just wait for the release and watch on my big tv and surround sound that I bought with all the money I save not going to movies. I enjoy watching at home with people who don\u2019t talk or use their phone. NTA but the theaters that allow phones and talking patrons are.", "NTA. That recording the movie is illegal.", "If they wanted to text for a longer period of time.", "Unfortunately it seems that people no longer know how to behave at movie theaters. I have a unlimited movie membership at my local theater and have run into a lot of AHs who think theaters are their rooms or something. The worst experience I had was a few months ago where we reserved seats in advance in the middle of the back row (bf doesn\u2019t like people sitting behind him in theaters) and these two large groups come in right before the movie theater, bot sitting all the way at the top with us on either side of us, with the rest of the theater empty. The group on the left spent the whole movie on their phones, taking selfies with the flash, yelling and arguing with each other to the point that a few of them would loudly move seats to halfway down only to later come back. There was even a little girl laying on the floor at their feet and we were seeing a horror movie. The group on the right would make loud comments about everything that happened in the movie and discuss it loudly. All of this happened during the whole movie, not just a few minutes worth. \n\nIt really sucks that this is what the common moviegoer has resorted to because tickets are expensive and we just want to enjoy ourselves. NTA and I\u2019m not really surprised the employees did nothing. I doubt they\u2019re paid enough to deal with all the entitled AHs who do this at theaters. I doubt that unless they were thrown out of the theater, they\u2019d continue even if they were told by employees to stop. Unfortunately they\u2019ll likely deal with at the minimum some verbal harassment for trying to kick them out. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that BS.", "Same. I\u2019m a passionate film buff, love going to the movies, and am sad that they\u2019re declining. I even pay for those overpriced snacks just to put some money into the theatres. But the other patrons are so awful and self-centred that it\u2019s become an unpleasant experience. I\u2019m going less and less often.\n\nNo one, absolutely no one, came to the movies to see your phone light or hear your conversations. Shut the hell up, put your phone away and off, and unless the movie/screening is targeted towards that age group, please, leave infants and toddlers at home.", "Yes.", "No I didn\u2019t.", "In my experience, opening night doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better behaviour.", "**\"Also, I only see movies on opening nights when I expect better behavior.\"**  \nthis is actually a really good tip. thanks", "This. Exactly this. I rarely go to the movies anymore because it really can get down to what happened with you and your group.  I was once followed to the ladies room and beaten up because I had the temerity to ask three girls in the row behind me to please be a little quieter (they were gossiping about friends, in full voice, through the movie).", "It\u2019s assigned seating. I also picked my seat for a reason.", "I'm really confused as to how OP ended up between a couple tbh. Not relevant to the phone thing but neither offered to switch seats?", "I was TRYInG to focus on the movie but couldn\u2019t with people on their phones next to me.", "It\u2019s reserved seating. I chose my seat for a reason.", "Don't use your phone in the movie theater. A \"darkened\" screen is still bright as fuck in the dark ass movie theater. Why do you do this? Normal people hate that you do this. They run the ads before the movie telling you not to do this for a reason! Why are you special and entitled?", "Right? I genuinely don\u2019t get why people even bother going.", "Are there even that many half decent movies every week?", ".... moviepass? did you hear their ceo got kidnapped? It's all in this very informative video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBO\\_7UezpbY", "It\u2019s also copyright theft and will get you immediately thrown out of the screen. At my local they periodically come in with some kind of detection device to check for AHs recording.\n\nIf I were OP I\u2019d contact the cinema and try to get some sort of comp voucher - they\u2019re getting their tickets cheap/free but they could also get discounted or free food for this incident. When I was still paying for individual movie tickets, I\u2019d complain and get a comp ticket for this.", "That's what he should have told manager.  Situation would've been dealt with differently by management", "Yes, I am sure that that billion dollar company is hurting because someone recorded the movie. /s", "Who's to say they weren't disturbing multiple people but OP was the only one to speak up?", "I guarantee you employees would rather deal with one complaint from the person who spoke up during the movie than ten complaints after the movie from people who were too lazy to come out and complain and instead got more and more annoyed as time passed until they raged at the employee as they left.\n\nNo one is going to voluntarily leave a movie to complain about something that didn\u2019t happen. Staff absolutely can say something even if they don\u2019t see it themselves. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some complaints about phone usage during the movie, we\u2019ll have to ask you to step out if you need to use your phone.\u201d You then step just out of view for a few minutes and watch. \n\nMost people take the hint. Many are paranoid they are still being watched and actively engross themselves in the movie to prove they aren\u2019t doing anything wrong until they don\u2019t even realize you\u2019re no longer there.", "But it's not really stupid though. Of course they have to catch them doing it so they can verify that there indeed is a customer that is breaking the rules and which customer it is. To the manager, you're just a random customer who could easily be mistaken on the person or lying out of jealousy, racism, xenophobia, general assholery or a multitude of other reasons because some humans behave terribly and you can't exactly just look at a person and go \"oh, they're 100% telling the truth\".", "They absolutely can let someone know there has a been a complaint and remind them to step outside if they need to use the phone. They may not want to remove the customer without witnessing it, but they can make them aware there was a complaint and that staff is watching them. \n\nAn exception would be if you can\u2019t identify who was being disruptive, you just know \u201csomeone down front had their phone on\u201d then staff might just observe. But if you told them exactly who they could have definitely said something. \n\nAnd pretty much no one is going to willingly miss part of a movie to complain about something that didn\u2019t happen at all.", "In my experience recently, opening night/weekend has been the worst for me. For better behavior I prefer a matinee on a weekday afternoon. To be fair that's probably not better behavior, just less people around to act badly lol.", "Lmao if you\u2019re that easily distracted by someone silently texting stay home. Your incessant complaining would\u2019ve been more annoying than a screen", "Depending on the cinema there can also be showing of old movies", "Ooh most realised my comment wasn\u2019t clear/misleading. It\u2019s $20 a month not week. So as long as I see at least 2 movies a month, it\u2019s worth it. \n\nThis week I\u2019m planning to see three movies. Saw Mafia Mama on Friday, def recommend it. It was funny and we love a good movie that says \u201cfuck the patriarchy\u201d. Last night I saw the popes exorcist which idk if it was because I was distracted but, I didn\u2019t react enjoy. \n\nI\u2019m seeing renfeld today and I\u2019m super excited for it.", "Hey they shouldn't be on the phone during the movie but you caused a major distraction for the entire theater by going to a director twice.", "AMC has a similar program", "That's exactly the video I was hoping for.", "No it\u2019s AMC stubs a list.", "Weird, that guy looks exactly like the CEO of Tide", "Right exactly like clearly I was annoyed enough to miss parts of the movie which I hate doing. And I told them exactly which seats the couple we\u2019re sitting in", "Lol what? You are what\u2019s wrong with society these days.", "The person texting during the movie should stay home.", "I don\u2019t involve myself with assholes whenever possible. And someone who thinks that\u2019s acceptable is for sure an entitled asshole.\n\nA retired cop shot and killed someone over this years ago, it started with a phone being on/used, escalated to popcorn throwing and now some kid will grow up without a Dad (the phone user).\n\nBut I also wouldn\u2019t sit there and pay money for some entitled asshole to make me mad and ruin my experience. I\u2019d leave and demand a refund and probably post a review so others would know and it would give more motivation for the theatre to start enforcing the rules. Enough people do that and the theatre will eventually crack down on it.", "Your opinion is wrong. Don't use your phone in a movie theater. There is literally no good reason to.", "I see, that's not a bad deal then.", "the rich and famous. it's all nepotism.", "Cry more", "Same goes for the person talking during the movie. A dim screen and texting is a lot less irritating than the person loudly policing the texters around them", "I'd just move seats", "Lol grow up. Your parents failed at raising you. Now run along I\u2019m done talking to a child.", "Nah. Texting during a movie shows complete self-centeredness and disdain for society. Asking someone to stop being rude at least has a considerate motivation behind it.", "Is your car purposely made to be used with no light inside of it, you know, like how movie theater is purposely dark? A light in a dark movie theater is distracting and it is not allowed for a reason.", "Stop using your phone in a movie theater. You are distracting everyone. It is a bright screen in a black room, even with the brightness \"turned down.\" You are unbelievably selfish and rude for doing this.", "I\u2019ve never heard there are cameras in movie theaters. Do you have a source for this?", "Who is to say how many others were disturbed by talking and were disturbed by texting.  I am sure the OP doesn't know how many people were silently wishing that she would drop the issue.   I am sure that getting up twice disturbed everybody behind the OP.  The OP could have taken a different seat the first time she got up to talk to management and then enjoyed the movie.  However, I suspect that the OP was more invested in seeing the drama of the texting couple get their comeuppance from management.  Deprived of that, the OP tried again.  Again disappointed, the OP created their own drama.", "I don't take my phone to the movie.  The darn thing is an irritation even when it is powered off.", "http://www.atthecinema.net/video-surveillance-systems-in-cinemas\n\nThere are a lot of sites that talk about this from a quick Google search, but here is one of the links. \n\nhttps://www.bigsecurity.com/video-security-camera-systems-for-movie-theaters.html\n\nHere is a link to a company that sells survalence cameras to movie theaters.", "Oh, you're sure of that huh! It's interesting seeing as it seems like you're in the assumption position just as much as the rest of us. Again, if the AHs, who were ignorant, rude and breaking the law, had, in fact, just made an intelligent, kind, and law abiding decision, none of this would have happened in the first place.", "You sure act like a person who uses their phone in the movie.", "*Again, if the AHs, who were ignorant, rude and breaking the law, had, in fact, just made an intelligent, kind, and law abiding decision, none of this would have happened in the first place.*\n\nI would have to agree with that.  Still the texting couple's inconsiderate behavior does not justify the OP's inconsiderate behavior toward the rest of the audience.  Did you notice that I changed my vote to ESH?\n\nAs for making assumptions, yes, in the light of insufficient information, that is what we have to do.", "Thanks for that explanation.  I'm changing my vote to ESH.  Texting couple and OP were distractions.", "You have seen me act anywhere?", "Weird hill to die on considering they\u2019ve already responded to you asking where you got \u201cten\u201d from\u2026 but okay."]}
