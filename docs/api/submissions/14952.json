Third, apparently, your movie theatre is different from everyone else's because all the theatres by me straight up state multiple times before a film to \"Turn off your ringer and put away your phone.\" Fourth, it's actually illegal to record any part of a film.

Please, spare the rest of the audience from your drama; just leave and get your money back.", "Yeah 100%. Most theaters have cameras facing the seats from where the screen is. They can literally see everything. A dim light every once in a while is not enough of a reason for them to want to get into a possible confrontation and disturb everyone's experience in the room. Depending on how the scenario plays out, this could take up a large chunk of time, enough that people may want their money back for the disturbance.", "Not the same thing", "Who is to say No one else in the theatre was also annoyed by the cellphone people. Sure, it was distracting for someone to be \"talking\", however, they only spoke because of someone else's bad behavior that was impinging on the experience they had paid for. It's a cause and effect. No cellphone use would have  meant no talking from the OP in the first place.", "None of the other people heard me because they weren\u2019t close (there were two people in the back) and I said it at a volume that only ten couple could hear.", "> You are being distracted by things that don't generally distract people. You, on the other hand, were definitely being a distraction to the people around you. You got up twice and even spoke during the movie.\n\nYou're wrong. Most people get distracted by phone screen in dark movie theatres. Just like how most people get distracted by talking in movie theatres.", "So, you disturbed ten people.  How many did you disturb when you got up to chase down the management?", "Just curious, me being older than dirt, is it the light or the fact that it is light from a phone.", "Wtf are you on about? What math are you doing? Where are they 10 people coming from?", "That comment very clearly has a typo. The OP meant \u201cthe\u201d not \u201cten\u201d. Come on now\u2026", "For me, it's the sudden appearance of light which draws your eyes away from the screen, even for a moment. Because the theatres turn the lights completely off, the only light that is usually seen come from the screen, the emergency exit sign and the lighting on the steps. Your eyes can adjust to that because it's constant and not too bright.\n\nBut when someone is texting, their phone screen will light up at random times, it's not a constant brightness. So when you're immersed in a film in the dark and you see something catch your eye either in the peripheral or in front of you, it breaks your immersion. Regardless if it's only for a second, it's distracting enough, and if it's happening often enough, it gets annoying.\n\nMaybe not the worst thing to do, but there's a reason why they clearly state before each film to turn your phones off. That's literally the rule in most theatres for a reason. \n\nI say this because I go to the movies often and every other film I've seen, there's been that one person to bring out their phone during the film more than once and it's caught my attention, and I'm sure it catches other people's attention as well.\n\nMaybe it's not distracting to some, but it IS distracting to others in some capacity.", "You just said ten other people could hear you.", "If the OP says it was a typo, then I will accept that.", "I agree they should not be using their phone and is against the rules.", "No I didn\u2019t. Sorry you clearly lack the ability to read. That\u2019s your problem not mine."]}
