They like to have party\u2019s but I am not really a party guy. I usually work late so I am tired when I get home so the 2 of them tell me when they are going to have a party and I find something else to do, usually go to a movie or something. Yesterday I had a really bad day at work and throughout the day it slipped my mind that they where having a party. When I got home I was annoyed but knew it was my fault for forgetting. They convinced me to come inside and have a drink and afterwards I felt better. I still wanted to go to bed so I just told them to maybe keep it down a little and they said okay. That should have been the end of last night. \nAbout an hour after I got home when I was dozing someone knocked on my door really hard and I ignored it. Then one of my roommates girlfriends friends came in my room. She (19F) was obviously drunk and I was also a bit drunk. She asked if she could stay in my bed because it was quiet and I said sure. It wasn\u2019t a big deal she laid on my bed and I fell asleep.\nI woke up this morning with her on top of me. She was fully clothed and nothing was to weird except for her using me as a pillow. Now my roommates girlfriend though is saying I am a weirdo loser asshole who took advantage of a drunk girl and if I was a good person I would have gone to another room to sleep. I explained what happened to my roommates and they are on my side. Also the girl who slept in my bed is also agreeing with me that nothing happened. But her group of friends are saying I am a weirdo for letting her in my bed and an asshole for not sleeping somewhere else.\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1691460099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l4crq/aita_for_not_leaving_my_bed_when_a_drunk_female/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not the girls boyfriend worrying, but another girl worrying.", "Maybe I should edit my original post (seeing some confusion) but the girl who crashed in my bed isn\u2019t my roommates girlfriend it\u2019s one of her friends who is single. My roommates and long time friends are both on my side and all heard the girl who slept in my room say nothing happened.", "His friends are on his side. It's the roommates girlfriends and their friends that are calling him weird and claiming he took advantage of the chick.", "As I understand it, the girl who was insulting OP was not the one who was sleeping in his bed. It was one of her friends.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It\u2019s confusing the way it is written but Roommate A and Roommate B have girlfriends. Roommate A\u2019s gf slept in OP\u2019s bed, and Roommate B\u2019s gf is complaining about it even though Roommate A\u2019s gf said she doesn\u2019t agree and thinks everything was fine.", "There are two \"roommate's girlfriends\" in the story I believe, one who slept in the bed and one calling him a weirdo", "How dare you not let her pee on you, she was just being hospitable!\n\n/s", "it wasn't the roommate's girlfriend, it was her friend. read before you accuse someone of cheating maybe?", "Please educate me: \"SJW\"?", "You found a lot more than a bed to crash in that night,you found a winner \ud83d\udc4d", "\u201c..pill\u201d.  Haven\u2019t heard that expression in 40+ years.  Where are you and roughly how old for you to use it?  I assumed it was dying out with my 90+ year old mother.  Love the word though.", "Also wait a minute is the girl that came in your room calling you an asshole or is it a different girl? I am slightly confused but either way you are not the asshole here... Whichever girl is talking shit is the asshole... I don't necessarily blame the drunk girl unless she is the one talking shit", "Honestly I didn\u2019t even KNOW she was saying this until I matched one of her friends on tinder. Went on a date and then she told me like a week later about what this girl was saying about me and that was the end of that \ud83d\ude02 \n\nIt\u2019s a wild world out there take care mate and good luck!!", "Yeah. The \"she\" who OP shouldn't feel comfortable around is the roommate's gf who made the accusations, not the wandering drunk friend who stood up for op.", ">Your way treats the woman like she\u2019s a Faberge egg and that\u2019s horribly misogynistic.\n\nna bro the way this person would treat women isn't about treating women as fragile, it's about men protecting ourselves against false accusations. The fact that OP is falsely accused of inappropriate behavior is exactly the issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMen need to protect ourselves because you sure as hell arern't going to do it for us. And if you're a man that don't change a damn thing because you clearly aren't watching out for men's best interests.", "In a perfect world it\u2019d be nonsense, I honestly do believe it\u2019s best to avoid intimate situations with drunk women, not understanding what part of that is misogynistic, but would be open to understanding.", "I meant in future if ever happens again, it's 5am here and I'm 11 hrs in on my night shift brain not working properly now lol", "Only if it's the top comment which won't happen.", "O.o... this makes it even more NTA.

I\u2019m Midwest and not quite to 40 yet. \ud83d\ude02 how doomed am I?", "The girl said nothing happened, it's her friends that are dating the roommates that are creating the drama.", "Different girl. My roommate\u2019s girlfriend is calling me an asshole and a creep. The girl who slept in my bed and my roommates are both on my side and know nothing happened.", "It\u2019s assuming that women are keen on accusing a man of impropriety.", "Though I can't fully tell if the girlfriend at fault is blaming him. She backed him up by saying nothing happened, but it didn't say if she was one of the girls calling him a weirdo. I think she is on his side and is a friend to the roommates girlfriend????", "Gotcha thank you I just saw the wording of \"roommates girlfriend\" twice and thought it was the same person", "Oh ok I gotcha... In that case.. fuck her... who the hell is she to go around saying that... She needs therapy", "They're not, but it does happen and it's absolutely life ruining for a man if it does. The risk-reward isn't worth it", "It sounds to me like it was a roommate's girlfriend who was calling him weird for letting one of her friends sleep in his bed and the girl who shared the bed with him was taking his side.", "Yeah my roommate is a long time friend and is kind of shocked at his girlfriend. He seemed pissed about what she was implying that I did even though her friend told her nothing happened. I know this might make me a jerk but if this is how his girlfriend normally is when things happen she is probably horrible to be around.", "Yea. I think so too. If the chick who is involved doesn't care, why she the roommates girlfriend care?", "He should be pissed you are not a jerk at all she sounds like a major pain in the ass", "That's the million dollar question. Maybe she just doesn't like OP and is trying to tear him down to try to stop her friends from liking him. That's just a guess though."]}
