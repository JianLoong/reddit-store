{"id": 24138, "submission_id": "15l4crq", "title": "AITA for not leaving my bed when a drunk female came into my room?", "selftext": "I (20M) live with 2 of my male friends in a pretty nice apartment. They like to have party\u2019s but I am not really a party guy. I usually work late so I am tired when I get home so the 2 of them tell me when they are going to have a party and I find something else to do, usually go to a movie or something. Yesterday I had a really bad day at work and throughout the day it slipped my mind that they where having a party. When I got home I was annoyed but knew it was my fault for forgetting. They convinced me to come inside and have a drink and afterwards I felt better. I still wanted to go to bed so I just told them to maybe keep it down a little and they said okay. That should have been the end of last night. \n\nAbout an hour after I got home when I was dozing someone knocked on my door really hard and I ignored it. Then a friend of my roommate\u2019s girlfriend came in my room. She (19F) was obviously drunk and I was also a bit drunk. She asked if she could stay in my bed because it was quiet and I said sure. It wasn\u2019t a big deal she laid on my bed and I fell asleep.\n\nI woke up this morning with her on top of me. She was fully clothed and nothing was to weird except for her using me as a pillow. Now my roommates girlfriend though is saying I am a weirdo loser asshole who took advantage of a drunk girl and if I was a good person I would have gone to another room to sleep. I explained what happened to my roommates and they are on my side. Also the girl who slept in my bed is also agreeing with me that nothing happened. But her group of friends are saying I am a weirdo for letting her in my bed and an asshole for not sleeping somewhere else.\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: The girl who came in to my room was not one of my roommate\u2019s girlfriends. It was one of their girlfriend\u2019s friends. The girl who slept in my bed is single and not friends with me or my roommates which is why it is worded weirdly. The only way any of us new her was through one of my roommate\u2019s girlfriends.
