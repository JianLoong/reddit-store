Will she handle any other future issues in your relationship with the same lack of concern?", "So I saw in the comments that she is suffering with depression and perhaps you are too.

But you are neglecting yourself. I'm worried.\" \n\nIf she's able to have this conversation with you and self reflect, you might be able to work on a solution. \n\nIf she's depressed, she needs treatment. If it's a sensory thing (cold water, hard bristles, wet skin, goopy toothpaste) there are small changes she can make to help her hygiene routine. Things like wet wipes, dry shampoo, soft bristles, tongue scrapers, dry toothpaste, toothpick floss,  a heater to warm the room during a shower are things that help me a lot with a hygiene routine.", "Oh man, the teeth thing is absolutely gross, dude. Only once a day is pretty gross, tbh. Once every two weeks is revolting. It\u2019s boring? What? It takes like 2 minutes. She sounds very mentally ill and you need to get her major help or she\u2019s going to get an infection or septic and she\u2019s going to have a pile of medical bills and/or possibly die.", "Oral b and sonicare/phillips have toothbrushes with Bluetooth and an app that can kinda turn brushing into a game (also teaches you how to brush with an electric toothbrush bc no one does it right haha). Maybe you can get her this, and bring her her toothbrush in bed with a cup to spit in. My husband and I do this for each other when we are super tired or sick. If you use a toothpaste like boka or risewell, it shouldn\u2019t be rinsed off after (and may help repair any damage she has done from going so long without brushing her teeth). Perhaps doing smol acts of kindness for each other in each of your depressions will help you both pull out of it. \n\nBe gentle about giving her the gift, let her know that oral health is key to longevity and dental issues can lead to a lot more serious health concerns \ud83d\udc9c \n\nThere are also waterless shower wipes. Maybe a pack by the bed will help her out a ton. Remind her you\u2019re doing this all from a judgement free zone, but that caring for herself in the best way she can by meeting her where she is will help tremendously. Even if she only has the energy to do pits and privates it will go a long way.\n\nETA, you could even offer to sponge bathe her with the wipes and extra kisses. Make it a sensual, bonding experience that makes her feel special and cared for. \n\nYou in no way need to take on this role of caretaker, but if you have it in you (and want to save yourself and nose as a bonus lol), it could possibly help her get started on the right track and show her she can get things done at 30-60% instead of having to do 100%, which is extremely daunting.\n\nETA again, have you considered it\u2019s a trauma response from abuse? Some people will subconsciously make themselves more \u201cgross\u201d to stop abuse from happening\u2026.and that can turn into a habit. Not saying this is the case here, but food for thought. Could explain why she is so very touchy about the subject.

If she was raised this way/her whole family is gross, then you might not be able to change much.", "This is the second hygiene post I\u2019ve seen today and it baffles me that people can stay in a relationship with someone who showers or brushes their teeth so infrequently. I refuse to kiss my bf if he hasn\u2019t brushed his teeth", "Once every two weeks is absolutely disgusting. This doesn\u2019t require a delicate conversation. This requires a major wake up call.

If she doesn't want to hear it, she has no interest in changing. She has shown you who she is. Now you must decide whether you like, & want to marry, that person. A person who has terrible hygiene.\n\nBy the way, I think she needs serious mental health help. \"It's boring\"? Is she serious? Is she five years old? Listen to music or a podcast or something while you shower & brush your teeth. She is setting herself up for future pain & VERY expensive dental bills. Not to mention no one is going to want to date her stank self.", "Ooof. NAH but your GF needs professional help because this sounds a lot like either a severe depression with some symptoms of catatonia or perhaps autism burnout. \n\nIf a person is struggling with activities called ADLs (\u201cactivities of daily living\u201d) this is typically a sign that something is very wrong and they need help to get out of the rut, but it\u2019s often very hard for them to accept help because they\u2019re already feeling like crap about themselves and probably ashamed. \n\nHas your GF always struggled like this or is it a newer behavior? Did she recently experience a major loss, failure, or traumatic event? Does your geographical region have something like adult protective services so that she could be connected to a social worker?  Does she have a job or leave the house much? \n\nAnd what are you doing to keep *yourself* healthy and whole? It\u2019s really painful to watch someone you love circling the drain like this, particularly since nobody can make them do anything unless they\u2019re an immediate risk of self-harm or harm to others. \n\nNot a clinician so please note this is not \u201cofficial\u201d medical advice, but I\u2019ve done a lot of volunteer peer counseling and dealt with severe depressive episodes myself, and all this rings very familiar. Hoping the questions above help you both get sorted. It\u2019s not easy to accept help when severely depressed, but I\u2019m glad I got the help I needed.

There are a lot of factors contributing to it but the main three are depression, fibromyalgia, and autism. I see you said she also struggles with depression? Perhaps she's also on the spectrum as well. Either way, you need to have proper communication with her. She's worried you are grossed out? Well you are and you need to communicate that. Try talking through strategies to help her work through the things needing to be done. Because of my fibromyalgia I have a bath stool that I can sit on which has been incredibly helpful. Offering to wash her hair for her might be a big help as well. \n\nThere will be crying and she will feel insecure but this needs to happen for her health and your happiness.
