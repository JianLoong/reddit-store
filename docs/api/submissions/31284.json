They want someone to come and help them with the kids. They haven't wanted you there until now. In fact, your relationship is so nonexistent that they couldn't even talk to you directly!! you were the last one to reach out to them. If they want you in their life, then they need to make some effort as well.", "NTA. They've made zero effort except to complain to your mother.\n\nYou hardly ever see them. Would your life be enriched if you saw them more often?\n\nIf no, you're done. If yes, is it worth the one-sided effort?", "NTA and you said it. The phone and the freeway go both ways. They can make an effort to visit you as well. My guess is your sibling wants you to participate for appearance's sake. Apparently they haven't changed much from their previously petty fake rich social media days.\n\nI'd tell your parents to butt out. You are both adults and if your sibling has a problem, they need to contact you directly.", "NTA\n\nThere isn\u2019t a foundation to build on and their lack of reciprocity makes it worse.", "NTA --- Let me translate for you, sibling is upset you don't make more of an effort to buy gifts/things for their kids and be around when they want/need a free babysitter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They don't want to a relationship w you, they want to know what \"you\" can do for \"them\"? It's funny how family doesn't have time for you, until you have something they want from you. Sounds like my in laws. Not good enough to hang out with, but always has their hands out expecting gifts on holidays and birthdays.  I get you. I really do.   \n\nI also barely escaped dying a couple months ago in a natural disaster.  Not one call or text from any brother in law or sister in law on my husband's side. I don't exist, until xmas rolls around and they expect us to send gifts for their kids.  I'm over it. No one's getting shit this year."]}
