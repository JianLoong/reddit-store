I know that all my friends who have Life360, sit and check on their kids' whereabouts every single day.

They are clearly tracking OP literally all hours of the day, every day. That is not \"in case of emergencies\".

There are a limited number of cases where 24/7 phone tracking can be justified, but the odds that 4 people in your life all fit into those special cases are slim to none.

They don't phone people in the middle of the night demanding answers. They don't get pissed about not being asked permission to do normal adult things(plays, studying at home?).  Those tracking apps don't solve murders(they rarely even help), they don't prevent kidnappings, the don't stop rape. \n\nThose tracking apps are designed to catch infidelity and work pretty decent at that.

If you cut them off from your location sharing, let them know you\u2019re sharing with a trusted friend so they don\u2019t need to worry.\n\nI should add that my husband and I, as well as her older sister, share our locations with her too. It\u2019s a shared family thing that we all respect and don\u2019t abuse.

You are actually....becoming an adult!!\n\nYou have to stand up for yourself at some point. \n\nAnd I think the only reason they are paying for your phone is so they can track you. \n\nGo to mint mobile and get cheap service. Eliminate the issue altogether!\n\nAnd feel no guilt. There is no reason for them to know where you are. If you need help, the whole school will reach you before they ever can!", "Nta but it's time you get your own phone", "NTA. You have helicopter parents and it\u2019s skewed your view of what\u2019s normal. This isn\u2019t normal.", "OP, it's time to get your own phone in your name, then they can't say anything. NTA.", "Get a burner and leave your smart phone at home whenever you go somewhere. Nta", "NTA.  Sounds like your parents may be a couple of narcissists.  Be wary.  If I were you, I'd cut that string and get your own phone and your own phone plan.  As long as they have strings attached to you, they have ammunition to pull stunts like this.  Cut those strings if you want real freedom.", "NTA-you need to learn to be an adult and enjoy your years at university (I really miss those years!) But I\u2019d say get your own phone and pay for your own service so they can\u2019t try to hold it over your head. And it\u2019s one thing to have it in case you were MIA for a few days and not answering calls but it\u2019s another thing to basically stalk you at all hours of the day.", "Perhaps surprisingly, NAH.  OP you are a new-minted adult, doing the sort of things that you should do.  The parents, while *wrong*, are coming from a place of love and concern.  Recommend you sit them down, praise them for worrying about you, but be firm that you've reached the time in your life where you *have to* be more self-reliant.  If you really want to spread the butter thick, remind them that it's their teachings that got you to this point.", "NTA, it is truUUULy a wonder why you wouldn\u2019t wanna visit lol.", "At first I was like: okay, according to the true crime stuff I watch and listen to it is probably clever to have such an APP.\n\nThen you explained how your parents are behaving and yeah NTA", "INFO: Who owns the car you drive? What does \"largely\" fund myself mean?", "YTA for even installing it to begin with. Let me be crystal clear, you are an adult. It is none of your parents business what you're doing, where you are going, or when you gwt home. If they were paying for 100% of your college needs (the way any real parent with the means to do so does) it still wouldn't change that reality. The cord should have been cut long ago. It's time to gently inform your parents they need to get a hobby. You are not some 8 year old they need to track and harass. You're an adult, in college, and it's time they start acting like it.", "Power move send the phone to them registered mail and get your own OP.", "Unlike the other parents you trust your kids, and I'm sure that trust is reciprocated.", "Ah yes, the white knights of reddit have arrived! Stay sheltered you poor incapable 18 year old female, the big scary world is just too much for your feminine hands! Beware! Better yet, wear a leash around so your mommy can keep you safe!", "And if OP has the misfortune to befall such nefarious attention, the chance that that tracking app will do her any good is basically zero. It serves no legitimate safety purpose.", "It's irrelevant who owns the car, or whether they help fund OP, this is controlling behaviour.\n\nThey don't get to, or need to, know every tiny detail of how OP lives. ESPECIALLY if she is not hurting her parents, other people, or herself. She is allowed to live her life her own way without being survailled or controlled through \"We own your car\" (if they do own it) or \"We help fund you\" like your questions imply.", "None of that matters. She owns the car if it was a gift. If not tell mommy she can shove it and to call the cops.", "Re-install the app first and leave the phone on when you send it, but don't tell them you sent it.", "I giggled at that. I like the way you think", "\"If you feel the need to cancel my phone, then do it. Don't expect to get my new number.\"", "I like to think we have an excellent relationship.  I trust them 100%. I'm incredibly proud of the young adults they are.", "Feel free to mail the phone to me in Australia. I will take it through some dubious places.\n\nPlaces can include (but not limited to) local prison, an LGBT friendly town and a Jehovah's witness church.. and I will take a picture of a koala or kangaroo too just cause.. Straya.", "Ooooh, that would be fun!"]}
