This is my first time posting.\n\nFor some background I\u2019m Bi and my parents are devout Christians. I\u2019ve never told them about a relationship in the past (guy or girl) because they always seem against me dating in general. Because of this I was pretty private with my life in general growing up. They noticed this a from time to time asked me to be more open and talk to them. This last Oct/Nov they said I was so secretive they felt like they didn\u2019t know me and wanted to build a better relationship. \n\nI never wanted to have a \u201ccoming out\u201d or anything like that because for me that\u2019s just not who I am. I just want to live my life with who I want. So I figured once I got into a serious with someone I would tell them then. I did let it slip maybe 7 yrs ago that I was dating a guy in conversation and it wasn\u2019t a great reaction they strongly suggested it was \u201ca phase\u201d.\n\nOver the years though they seemed to grow and become more understanding so I thought when I was ready it would be better. \n\nSo on to the dilemma. I (28M) have been with my bf \u201cGriffin\u201d (27m) for 9mo. We are long distance so we fly back and forth to stay with each other every month. Because of this we\u2019ve gotten pretty serious ,have met each others coworkers ,friends, bosses etc. He also told his parents about me. He is for sure my forever person. \n\nNow my mom ( 55F) and my dad\u2019s (57m) vow renewal (basically like a second wedding for already married people) is next week. \n\nI asked to talk to them both in person as it was important they were suppose to come over the first day but said they were busy and were going to come the next day. The next day comes and they push it off again another day. Wednesday comes but only my Dad showed up. I was a bit annoyed by this but i just wanted to get it over with. \n\nSo I told my dad about Griffin and he said \u201cI\u2019m not going to disown you , you\u2019re my son and I love you but this is against my beliefs and I don\u2019t approve of it. I don\u2019t want to meet him or know anything about him ever\u201d.  I felt pretty defeated so I just said ok and left the room. He then left and my mom called. She said she was busy with planning so she couldn\u2019t make it over but my Dad told her and she wanted to meet him to know who I was dating but did not want him to stay at the house when he visits again (I rent one of my parents properties they don\u2019t live there it\u2019s just me and my dog \u201cBubble\u201d). She also refused to call him my boyfriend and referred to him as a friend.And said I\u2019d have to answer to God for my sin.  \n\nSo now I\u2019m torn. I know their vow renewal is a big deal and I am suppose to walk my mom down the isle all of our family and extended family will be there but considering their reaction and lack of support in my relationship, I don\u2019t feel like I should support theirs.

I think it would be incredibly difficult to publicly support two people who do not support you.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m sure it would be incredibly painful for you to do that given their homophobia.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t go either.

They\u2019re going to make your life hell with their homophobia and you and Griffin don\u2019t deserve that.  Skip it and go house hunting with Griffin instead :)", "NTA. I think you need to have a conversation with your parents about what it means that they cannot accept your partner, and more importantly, that they can't accept you as you are. Be clear with them the way you expect to be treated--and it is more than reasonable to expect your parents to be supportive of your relationship--then tell them it's up to them to do so. If they will not, then you will keep your distance, including not being part of the vow renewal. You may need to consider how this will impact your housing situation, given that you are currently their tenant and they have already attempted to tell you whom you can and cannot have at the place you pay to stay. \n\nI'm so sorry that your parents have reacted this way. You deserve their acceptance and support, and the fact that they have not given that to you--for years, because you've been hiding an important part of yourself for a long time knowing they would not be accepting--demonstrates something deeply wrong with them. Good luck to you moving forward.", "NTA They just showed their true colors.  That their religion is more important than their own child, and despite saying they won't disown you, they're trying to disown major things about you. They're making it your job to make THEM comfortable about your life instead of accepting you. So if you don't feel comfortable being around them, don't.  Plus, I'm guessing the renewal is a religious event?  So it's understandable not wanting to be there.  But at least tell them if you're not going to attend (if you're comfortable).\n\nEditing to add: this doesn't mean you have to cut them out or never revisit the conversation.  But because this is still so fresh and hurts, it's ok to need space right now.", "NTA if you choose not to go, but understand you need to get yourself completely untangled from them now that they've shown you who they are.", "NTA ***BUT...***\n\nI don't  know.  Do you support your parents' continued marriage? This ceremony is really about them,  not you.  So you can walk her down the aisle and play nice for  a bit. Hi can leave the reception early. You have a friend waiting!\n\nIf you don't go at all, you better plan on finding other housing arrangements, Pronto! Because you will be the topic of conversation during the whole shindig,  whereas if you leave  early,  your parents can shrug their shoulders and say \"he had a work commitment\" or whatever. \n\nAfter the ceremony, you can certainly decide to go no contact. And I would look for another place to live, since they are trying to dictate who you can and cannot invite into your place of residence. But if you show up and play along, you'll be able to look at a more leisurely rate. If you just don't show up, you and Bubble will be twisting in the wind, and believe me, it's quite hard to find a rental that allows dogs in this market. \n\nIf,  since you are bi, you eventually marry a woman, don't invite these people.

Not an easy decision, and wrong you have to make it.", "Definitely YWNBTA.... but\n\nI am unclear about what you were expecting.

You can either choose to attend or not but I don\u2019t see how it will help you in any way in the long run. You are free to love whoever you choose that has nothing to do with your parents. If you no longer support their marriage then that\u2019s a separate issue.", "NTA, It's up to you and I wouldn't blame you at all for skipping, but think about whether you're upset and uncomfortable or just trying to teach them a lesson.

If my parents couldn\u2019t do the basic courtesy of not being bigoted about my relationship then I\u2019m not going to their how renewal to support their continued marriage or whatever. You don\u2019t owe unsupportive bigots anything, even if they are your parents. \n\nIf you decide to not go to the vow renewal or to go low / no contact, I do suggest you have money set aside because I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your parents try to evict or remove you from their rental property after that.", "NTA my own mother is someone I am super low contact with. It is just not worth my emotional wellbeing. if it will hurt you then do not go!!!!", "WNBTA. Honestly, I think you'd be more of an AH if you DID go to the vow renewal.", "NTA. But I have to be honest-To go from being the one who was supposed to walk with your mom to not going I just don't know. I mean you have every reason to not want to, but it seems to me their reaction to your relationship would hardly be news and they were clear about where they stood before. I guess I would have just said no to going or being involved from the get go.", "In my humblest of opinions, I think that not going would be petty, and not demonstrate what loving family members do for each other. I would go, and revisit the conversation at a later date. They've just learned the information, and they need some time to sit with it and think about it. When you do revisit it, I'd plan it to be at a neutral location (like a coffee shop), and try to work it in after some pleasant conversation. Perhaps you could throw in some of their religious beliefs into the mix such as it's not up to them to judge you. Jesus loved everyone. Love is love. \n\nI am sorry that you are dealing with this. I think it is hard for some people to accept that their children arent living the life they'd planned and dreamed for them. Many parents dream about their children growing up and getting married to a member of the opposite sex and living essentially the same life that they themselves live. If they haven't had much interaction with gay couples, it is totally foreign to them.", "Really?\n\nDo you really have to democratize the answer with a bunch of randos when the answer is obviously yes, YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
