It was attended by our group of friends, some of my friends colleague\u2019s, and a group of her husband\u2019s colleagues. I attended alone as my own husband was at work. \n\nThe day was fun but the groups didn\u2019t really mix until later in when the colleagues from the husbands company mingled with us after they\u2019d had some drinks. \n\nI needed to leave to get home for my sitter to go home, so I called a taxi. My friend offered to wait outside her house with me but I declined and gave her a hug, then said goodbye to everyone and went to wait. \n\nA moment later one of the husband\u2019s colleagues came out and asked if he could catch a ride with me to be dropped off on my route home. \n\nNow my friend and I live on opposite sides of the city so this was going to be an expensive journey, however, I didn\u2019t mind dropping him off if I was going that way anyway. \n\nThe taxi arrives and we head off, but as we reach the main road to head east, this guy tells the driver to continue on over and head south. The female driver eyed me in the mirror then asked him his address, which turned out to be not on my route, but a detour that would add at least another \u00a310 to my journey. \n\nI asked this man did he have cash on him to pay for that. He handed me a \u00a31 coin. He looked me dead in the eye as he did it. I just looked at him and said I think it\u2019s going to be more than that. \n\nHe then said next time we see each other I will owe you anything, I laughed, and he then said suggestively, anything you want. \n\nI asked the taxi driver to pull over and told the guy he would need to walk from there because I wasn\u2019t paying for him. \n\nSo I feel conflicted; had that been a woman who couldn\u2019t afford the ride home I would have absolutely taken her. But I was just shocked this grown man with a good job had the audacity to give me a single \u00a31 after he accosted me alone to get in my taxi. It\u2019s so ridiculous it\u2019s almost funny. But I also feel like a dick for chucking him out to walk home at night. My friend was appalled when I told her and said I shouldn\u2019t feel bad. My husband says if he is at the next social event he is going to let this guy know how creepy he behaved.

He was banking on you not making a fuss. The \u00a31 coin thing is just cheeky. If I didn't have cash and the taxi didn't accept card the first thing I'd do would be to get out my bank app and ask that person for their deets so I could transfer.", "NTA and I hope your friend told her husband so he could have a word with his colleague. That guy was acting like a creep.", "Absolutely NTA. He was either trying to get a freebie ride or take you home. Very creepy of him to jump into your ride by lying either way.", "NTA he was predatory", "Nta he thought you were weak and would just do it and he ended up having to walk/wait for ride", "Oh, goodness, NTA. This fellow was a scammer clear and through. Please, stop overthinking it and proceed guilt free!", "NTA, you did everything right.", "NTA - the way you've presented it he was weird and inappropriate.\n\nBut it is possible he genuinely didn't have cash on him and he's a normal bloke who will give you a tenner next time he sees you or when he's next at work with your friend.
