It was attended by our group of friends, some of my friends colleague\u2019s, and a group of her husband\u2019s colleagues. I attended alone as my own husband was at work. \n\nThe day was fun but the groups didn\u2019t really mix until later in when the colleagues from the husbands company mingled with us after they\u2019d had some drinks. \n\nI needed to leave to get home for my sitter to go home, so I called a taxi. My friend offered to wait outside her house with me but I declined and gave her a hug, then said goodbye to everyone and went to wait. \n\nA moment later one of the husband\u2019s colleagues came out and asked if he could catch a ride with me to be dropped off on my route home. \n\nNow my friend and I live on opposite sides of the city so this was going to be an expensive journey, however, I didn\u2019t mind dropping him off if I was going that way anyway. \n\nThe taxi arrives and we head off, but as we reach the main road to head east, this guy tells the driver to continue on over and head south. The female driver eyed me in the mirror then asked him his address, which turned out to be not on my route, but a detour that would add at least another \u00a310 to my journey. \n\nI asked this man did he have cash on him to pay for that. He handed me a \u00a31 coin. He looked me dead in the eye as he did it. I just looked at him and said I think it\u2019s going to be more than that. \n\nHe then said next time we see each other I will owe you anything, I laughed, and he then said suggestively, anything you want. \n\nI asked the taxi driver to pull over and told the guy he would need to walk from there because I wasn\u2019t paying for him. \n\nSo I feel conflicted; had that been a woman who couldn\u2019t afford the ride home I would have absolutely taken her. But I was just shocked this grown man with a good job had the audacity to give me a single \u00a31 after he accosted me alone to get in my taxi. It\u2019s so ridiculous it\u2019s almost funny. But I also feel like a dick for chucking him out to walk home at night. My friend was appalled when I told her and said I shouldn\u2019t feel bad. My husband says if he is at the next social event he is going to let this guy know how creepy he behaved.

Ask yourself if it was a woman who could 100% afford the fare? You\u2019d think her a scammer. This guy\u2019s a scammer.", "NTA. He can pay his own way.", "NTA. \"I do not have cash on me, but I might sexually harrass you in the future, so let us just call it even\".

The cab driver clearly agreed with you and felt the vibes were off as well. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I think he's both a scammer and a creep. Kudos to you for calling him on it. \n\n He will probably try something similar AGAIN\\~but if your reaction causes him to do it *less often?* A WIN!!", "NTA. He literally tried to take advantage of you by making you pay for his taxi fare then got creepy and gave you a pound? Fuck that prick. That behaviour is not acceptable. Cheap weird bastard.", "NTA he knew what he was doing", "ESH. \n\nYour last paragraph is sexist and ugly.", "He was basically offering you a quid for sex.\n\nNTA.", "NTA! You successfully offloaded a creep. Congratulations!", "NTA.

That person should have offered to pay part of the shared route and 100% for the remaining part BEFORE the ride.\n\nIm curious: How did he know where you were headed, and why would you agree to ride with someone who is basically a stranger?", "We do have mobile banking which is pretty instant, which is why it was so odd. The taxi would also have had contactless payment so he could have said for it to take him home, paid to there and then I pay the rest of the journey. There was nothing though, just the single coin in my hand and the proposition when I questioned it.", "How so? The man wanted to bum a free ride and then hit on op, he seems pretty ugly to me.", "If he had said that he couldn\u2019t afford it or anything like that I would have been more sympathetic.

Also, almost everyone has some Payment App on their phones - or he could have at least explained why he didn't have money at the money but would send you money the next day.\n\nAlso he should have offered to pay half of the fare as soon as he approached you.

The small detour he caused did cost extra on my journey and of course I paid that.", "This man gave me no indication he couldn\u2019t afford it. Who asks to share someone\u2019s taxi and add to the fare without expecting to pay for it. As I\u2019ve said previously, I would have been more sympathetic had he not been so creepy about it.", "Hey I appreciate how that reads. If they guy had been genuine I would definitely have handled it differently, but his whole cop was here is a single coin and if you want more then wink wink. That\u2019s offensive. But I did feel conflicted that\u2019s why I posted here, letting him walk home at night didn\u2019t make me feel great, but I also would do the same thing again if presented with that proposition.", "NTA - He wanted a free ride on your dime.  It would be different if his drop off was truly along the way, not miles from it.  Tell the cheapo to pay up.", "NTA. Mind blown.", "**NTA!!!**\n\nHe was totally out of line, not just with his creepy come on, but trying to detour YOUR taxi and expect you to pay for it.

It was kind of like whatever he works with your husband. That's not really much. Until the sexual innuendo. That was a good reason to throw him out. Highly innapropriate to hit on your work colleagues wife. NTA.", "That was beautiful", "So earlier in the evening he had joined our group to mingle, a friend was asking about my new house as I\u2019ve recently moved. That\u2019s how he knew the area I was going. And while he was basically a stranger he was trusted to be at my friends home and it didn\u2019t seem a problem to me to drop him off on my route home, until it became a problem.", "Your comment screams \"white lives matter.\" Surely you're a better person than this.", "He also misrepresented where he lived, I believe.", "Awesome, I wish it was an \"of course,\" but some people wouldn't have, especially given how uncomfortable the situation was", "Yeah but still. 10 pounds is like 15 minutes or less. I mean a bit of an idiot but whatever. It was the sex thing that was way too much.", "NTA. \n\nDude was being creepy as hell. Worst case scenario, he planned the whole thing to try to proposition you, which is cringe and just ew (and I hope he didn't get your address from this). Best case scenario, he thought he was being funny and didn't know how to read the room.

I have not met this person before.", "Unless your friend handpicked each and every one of them - the fact that this dude was at the party means absolutely nothing.\n\nI don't mean to insult you or anything, but please be careful next time.
