She seemed sorry I didn't want us to fight anymore so I forgave her. A lot of people suggested that I have a sort of celebration with my daughter which I did do. We baked a cake together yesterday and she also made me a birthday card (there's glitter everywhere now) which was very sweet! \n\nThis probably wasn't the update most people wanted since a lot of people who replied wanted me to divorce her or for there to be some big fight between my wife but I just don't think that's necessary. I really love her and I'm happy with her, I don't want anything to change this was just a mistake that hopefully won't happen again.

How is it YOUR fault she forgot your birthday? Come on, now.", "This is just sad.", "Dude, the *one* thing someone should remember is their partner's birthday. The fact that she even said it was your fault for not reminding her speaks volumes. If she actually cared about you, if your happiness was that important to her, she would have remembered\u2014or she would have at least been extremely apologetic upon realizing she forgot.\n\nInstead, she yelled at you and acted like your birthday isn't important enough to remember.

What about other milestones? Does she need to be reminded of your anniversary? Her own parents or family members birthdays? Literally every event that happens in your life does she not take the initiative to remember and engage on her own??? \n\nWhat she said is completely ridiculous and cruel. You have known her for a presumably more than one birthday, right? Considering your daughter is 4 years old your wife has experienced multiple birthdays with you. If after 5 plus years she can't remember your birthday she honestly doesn't give AF. \n\nYou don't have to divorce her but the same time that doesn't mean you go through life being treated like shit and being told you deserve to be treated like shit. \n\nYou have a daughter that you need to set an example by.

He had definitely not planned for it and scrambled a couple days before it, but never forgotten it completely. And if he ever did, he would feel terrible and not blame me. Between yelling at you for being upset and then blaming you, she sounds abusive. People in abusive relationships often don\u2019t realize they\u2019re being abused.

Instead of being accountable (remembering was HER responsibility, not yours), she blamed you. Instead of apologizing, she blamed you.

Don't fall for it.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nUrge your wife to update her 2024 Daytimer, calendar, etc. NOW with reminders for every birthday and other important family event.

No excuse for ever forgetting anyone in the family/neighbourhood's birthday or anniversary again.\n\nThere's lots of themed choices for these - I like the Sandra Boynton one but there's floral or horses/mountains/dolphins/tv-shows etc choices too - look online and pick something she likes so it doesn't look passive-aggressive (actually maybe just get one for your kid instead, but still ensure it gets placed somewhere the whole family can see it daily).", "i wish she had given you a better apology than that. hopefully she does better moving forward, but by her response\u2026 keep an eye out, know your worth. i mark down birthdays on my phone so that i don\u2019t forget anyone! some i remember, others the dates get switched around, but i make sure everyone\u2019s bdays are in my phone (i even give them emojis!). maybe suggest that to your wife? i think certain phones you can use family sharing to share a calendar, but i\u2019m not entirely sure\n\ni\u2019m glad you had time with your daughter!!! trust me, she\u2019ll appreciate you letting her use the glitter. it was probably the best parts of crafts at home, my dad hated the clean up but liked having new art to display at work.", "Um... she should know your birthday.

You should *not* have to remind your wife, of all people, of your birthday. You just shouldn't. And the fact that she is actually placing some of the blame on *you* for not doing so instead of just taking responsibility, acknowledging that she messed up and apologizing is... not great, to say the least. All she's doing here is making excuses (too \"tired\" to remember a birthday? really?) or deflecting responsibility onto you. Everyone makes mistakes, sure, but the way she's reacting is a bit concerning imo. \n\nYou deserve better. Would your wife be willing to consider counseling? Because it feels like there's something there besides just being tired and defensive over making a mistake.

The wife sucks but if OP is okay with that then he can continue to have all the forgotten birthdays he didn\u2019t remind her of in his future then.", "This was my take exactly. She clearly won't take responsibility for any of this. He shouldn't have to remind her and being tired is something everyone suffers with most days.", "For real, this is super sad :/ forgetting happens. Life is weird. Sometimes we fuck up. All I know is, is if I forgot someone's birthday even if I'm not super close to them, it would not even enter my head as a possibility to lay any blame for that at their feet. People get weird about birthdays, or insist that celebrating one as an adult is childish. Usually after theyve been called out for forgetting. It really is just a baseline showing of care though. Caring deeply doesn't mean you won't fuck up and forget, but it does mean you won't try to make someone feel even worse because of your own lack of care or attentiveness", "some people just suck at remembering birthdays. my ex-wife was incredibly generous in nature and with her time, loved getting people gifts that they'd enjoy, basically all the traits you'd associate with being good at birthdays. And she was, if she didn't completely forget them.\n\nFor me, the reason it never upset me is because she'd forget her sister's, her mum's, her own birthday. So i never took it personally and just got in the habit to remind her. It was never a big deal.\n\nOn the other hand, if my partner only seemed to forget my birthday and no one else's, I'd be quite upset.

I hope you find someone who loves you back OP.", "That ENTIRE section right there actually made me say \"yo wtf?!\"out loud. Yknow how many times my husband and i have been bone deep exhausted during one of the other's birthdays? Frequently,  especially after kids. But never, EVER have i not only NOt forgotten my husband's birthday but never BLAMED *him* for *me* forgetting his birthday. Not ONCE in 15 years together. What kind of DARVO crap is that?!", "Unless she was unexpectedly working 12 hour shifts every single day for the entire month leading up to his birthday, what was her excuse for not remembering or preparing in advance? Nobody buys someone\u2019s birthday present, gathers friends to celebrate, books a restaurant for a meal, etc on he day. Being tired on the day is an excuse and a weak one at that, the planning, effort, and preparation to celebrate someone\u2019s birthday is all done in advance. Once the work to celebrate is done it\u2019s not hard to remember on the day to actually celebrate.", "Right if the shoe was on the other foot the wife would never forgive him for forgetting her birthday. He shouldn\u2019t have to remind her I mean they\u2019ve been together for years it\u2019s really no excuse", "OP should do the same to her and if she asked why OP didn't wish her, OP should give her the same replies.", "Yeah that\u2019s manipulative as heck.", "Ffs textbook gaslighting.", "Also that she 'seemed sorry' instead of saying that she was sorry. Not even an 'I'm sorry it hurt your feelings' deal, which is a half-apology at best.

I\u2019m sure she remember some random co worker/ or church member\u2019s birthday but can\u2019t remember her own husbands??? I\u2019m not accepting that excuse. I hope OP take this as a sign to know how much his wife doesn\u2019t care about him.", "Yikes. If only there were things invented like calenders and such. \n\nWow, how crappy a person is that. Why is op accepting this?", "Like if she's your wife she should know when your birthday is, she shouldn't need someone else to remind her. I understand she was tired but op doesn't need to tell her about something she should already know. I haven't read the original post so I might be missing something though.", "The sad thing is, while he is an adult and can remain in an abusive marriage, if he wishes, he doesn't think about his daughter who has to grow up in an abusive home like he has. He is just continuing the cycle of abuse. YTA to yourself and your daughter, OP. Btw, just because she doesn't beat you, doesn't mean it's not abuse.", "I'm embarrassed for OP.", "Truly.", "Right? OP will probably regret this decision a few years into the futures. He doesn\u2019t realise what it\u2019s like to not be loved\u2026 she literally said his reason for crying was \u201cnot important\u201d, and passed the blame onto OP. I\u2019m assuming this happens a lot in their relationship- where she makes OP the one at fault (I may just be assuming though).

Everyone should be celebrated on their birthday!", "I guess she just doesn't wanna admit she messed up. I hope op talked or will talk to his wife about how dismissive she was and how bad she made him feel. If she knew about the insecurities op has about his birthday not being celebrated or even acknowledged at the very least she should have tried to make him feel loved and appreciated instead of putting the blame on him.

But thanks :)", "Read the original post", "Thanks!", "I was gonna buy a calendar anyways! Last year I marked all of the important days (birthdays, holidays etc) on it with my daughter to teach her all the months and numbers, even though I think she forgot everything the next day because she was only 3 but that's okay haha", "Alright thank you\n\nThanks! Glitter is her favourite thing to decorate things with which is very unfortunate for me when I have to clean it all up afterwards haha", "Thank you", "There really is no reason for you to be mean.", " I plan on responding to all of them I'm just a bit busy at the moment", "Maybe, thanks", "Thank you!\n\nI keep finding glitter in places that she hasn't even used it there. I don't understand how such a small child can create such a big mess", "Thank you!", "Even if she didn\u2019t have a phone, paper calendars exist.

Maybe better communication after\u2026 I\u2019m just sad. \n\nOn me, I\u2019ll admit I had it all calendared and everything and I completely forgot to greet my wife just before bed as is our usual tradition.
