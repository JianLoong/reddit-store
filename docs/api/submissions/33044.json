She seemed sorry I didn't want us to fight anymore so I forgave her. A lot of people suggested that I have a sort of celebration with my daughter which I did do. We baked a cake together yesterday and she also made me a birthday card (there's glitter everywhere now) which was very sweet! \n\nThis probably wasn't the update most people wanted since a lot of people who replied wanted me to divorce her or for there to be some big fight between my wife but I just don't think that's necessary. I really love her and I'm happy with her, I don't want anything to change this was just a mistake that hopefully won't happen again. My wife told me that it's partly my fault anyway because I should've reminded her that it was my birthday but I didn't and I agree with that.

How is it YOUR fault she forgot your birthday? Come on, now.", "This is just sad.", "Dude, the *one* thing someone should remember is their partner's birthday. The fact that she even said it was your fault for not reminding her speaks volumes. If she actually cared about you, if your happiness was that important to her, she would have remembered\u2014or she would have at least been extremely apologetic upon realizing she forgot.\n\nInstead, she yelled at you and acted like your birthday isn't important enough to remember.

But seriously, be careful with this one.", "Well this was a depressing af update.\n\n>My wife told me that it's partly my fault anyway because I should've reminded her that it was my birthday\n\nSo is she saying it's okay for her to forget your daughter's birthday if no one reminds her? What about other milestones? Does she need to be reminded of your anniversary? Her own parents or family members birthdays? Literally every event that happens in your life does she not take the initiative to remember and engage on her own??? \n\nWhat she said is completely ridiculous and cruel. You have known her for a presumably more than one birthday, right? Considering your daughter is 4 years old your wife has experienced multiple birthdays with you. If after 5 plus years she can't remember your birthday she honestly doesn't give AF. \n\nYou don't have to divorce her but the same time that doesn't mean you go through life being treated like shit and being told you deserve to be treated like shit. \n\nYou have a daughter that you need to set an example by.

Not compassion and kindness, but cruelty and neglect?", "Nah that\u2019s bs on your wife if she loved you she would at least remember your birthday and or even say it you don\u2019t want to divorce her that\u2019s on you but dude the fact she not only got mad at you for not reminding her she\u2019s definitely manipulating you and she don\u2019t love or care for you", "Sorry but your marriage sucks and your wife just gaslit you to the moon.

He had definitely not planned for it and scrambled a couple days before it, but never forgotten it completely. And if he ever did, he would feel terrible and not blame me. Between yelling at you for being upset and then blaming you, she sounds abusive. People in abusive relationships often don\u2019t realize they\u2019re being abused.

Instead of being accountable (remembering was HER responsibility, not yours), she blamed you. Instead of apologizing, she blamed you.

In this case, she is gaslighting you, making you think it was partly *your* fault that *she* failed to remember your birthday. Don't fall for it.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nUrge your wife to update her 2024 Daytimer, calendar, etc. NOW with reminders for every birthday and other important family event.

Terrible, no empathy and I hated him for it. You don\u2019t treat a loved one like that, there are no excuses. Did your wife even apologize for yelling at you?

No excuse for ever forgetting anyone in the family/neighbourhood's birthday or anniversary again.\n\nThere's lots of themed choices for these - I like the Sandra Boynton one but there's floral or horses/mountains/dolphins/tv-shows etc choices too - look online and pick something she likes so it doesn't look passive-aggressive (actually maybe just get one for your kid instead, but still ensure it gets placed somewhere the whole family can see it daily).", "i wish she had given you a better apology than that. hopefully she does better moving forward, but by her response\u2026 keep an eye out, know your worth. i mark down birthdays on my phone so that i don\u2019t forget anyone! some i remember, others the dates get switched around, but i make sure everyone\u2019s bdays are in my phone (i even give them emojis!). maybe suggest that to your wife? i think certain phones you can use family sharing to share a calendar, but i\u2019m not entirely sure\n\ni\u2019m glad you had time with your daughter!!! trust me, she\u2019ll appreciate you letting her use the glitter. it was probably the best parts of crafts at home, my dad hated the clean up but liked having new art to display at work.", "Um... she should know your birthday.

You should *not* have to remind your wife, of all people, of your birthday. You just shouldn't. And the fact that she is actually placing some of the blame on *you* for not doing so instead of just taking responsibility, acknowledging that she messed up and apologizing is... not great, to say the least. All she's doing here is making excuses (too \"tired\" to remember a birthday? really?) or deflecting responsibility onto you. Everyone makes mistakes, sure, but the way she's reacting is a bit concerning imo. \n\nYou deserve better. Would your wife be willing to consider counseling? Because it feels like there's something there besides just being tired and defensive over making a mistake.
