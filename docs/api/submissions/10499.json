In our bathroom, I have a basket of pads, tampons, and panty liners on a shelf near the toilet. The only cabinets and draws in the bathroom are too far away from the toilet for me to reach while sitting on it, so the main reason I did this was so that I could change my products more easily. It also makes them more accessible for guests. That way if someone comes over and needs a pad or tampon, they won\u2019t have to go digging through our cabinets and draws to find one. My bf\u2019s brother (M26) came over today to see our apartment. After using the bathroom, he complained about my period products being out in the open and said I should put them away because \u201cnobody wants to see that\u201d.  But I don\u2019t think he has the right to come into my apartment and tell me where to put my stuff. My bf told him \u201cWhen you start menstruating, you can tell her where to put her products.\u201d and he got mad and said \u201cNobody needs to know whether a woman menstruates or not and nobody needs to see her products.\u201d I genuinely don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so disgusting about seeing a wrapped, unused, period product in someone\u2019s bathroom.", "created_utc": 1676939064, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117pcmt/aita_for_keeping_my_period_products_out_in_the/", "score": 693, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can ask the hosts discretely if he needs something so personal and gross, since it would be gross to leave it in the bathroom in plain view. Make sure you put it somewhere very \"discrete\", meaning not in a bathroom cupboard where he can find it on his own.", "Absolutely NTA. Props to your bf for standing up for you as well. He's a keeper.", "NTA because your bf who actually lives with you is fine with it so who cares what his brother thinks.\n\nFor the record I\u2019m a woman who keeps her sanitary products in the cupboard and has never had any difficulty managing getting them out before using the toilet. I also have never heard of someone expecting to use sanitary products at someone else\u2019s house as where I\u2019m from we are all very prepared with our own. I would side eye a basket of period goodies in someone\u2019s bathroom to be honest.\n\nSo what I\u2019m saying is my outlook is 100% the opposite of yours when it comes to storage of sanitary products but even I still think it\u2019s your bf\u2019s brother who is TA here.", "I don\u2019t understand why some guys are such snowflakes about menstruation. Your bf\u2019s brother needs to grow the fuck up. NTA.", "NTA And I LIKE your bf! So nice to see a dude in favor of normalizing feminine hygiene products! A friend of mine's college age son carries tampons and pads in his backpack in case someone needs them.", "I know some people in the southern US pronounce the word \"drawer\" differently, but they also spell it differently (\"draw\")?", "\"Nobody needs to know whether someone poops or not!\" - OP's bf's bro, probably", "Wait, am I the only one keeping my TP in the cupboard?", "I hope he never goes to a retail store. God forbid he's shopping and sees pads and tampons or incontinence supplies on a shelf, where other people will see. Cause somewhere out there, someone is menstruating. The horror!!!1!", "That's what I was thinking. Or, you know, the period products on the shelves in grocery stores. Does this guy never go to the store?", "If it were my brother, that would be my cue to chase him around the apartment with tampons.", "The only cabinet in my bathroom is the one above the sink. Boxes of tampons are in a container on the windowsill next to the toilet, toilet paper is in a storage tub under the sink. If anyone has an issue with it, they are very welcome to take the 5 minute walk to the nearest servo and use the toilet there.", "I thought a little curtain on a draw string was standard but the cupboard works too.", "SHIT TICKETS NOOOOOOOOO \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "Shit tickets \ud83e\udd23 never heard that before and yes it is going to be my new favorite thing to say.", "that aisle is always clearly marked (and avoidable) and on the rare occasion that 'feminine hygiene' doesn't take up an entire aisle, they usually pair it with cleaning products or something else that someone like the brother would never need.", "My son's two best friends are girls. Lots of period talk. He & his friends walked one day and he said, \"Mom, do you have any tampons? We're going to the gym and [friend] got her period and needs a tampon.\"\n\nHanded him one, friend used the bathroom, and then off they went. Totally normal. Your BIL is super weird.", "You got the good brother", "BF is a keeper. Bro, not so much.", "I get awful bloody noses in the winter.  I've been period free for a few years, but I still keep tampons in my car for this reason.", "It actually tends to be on the same aisle as \u201cfamily planning\u201d products, I.e. condoms and such.", "You\u2019ve got a good kid\u2014well done!", "100%", "The first time I suggested to my S/O to use a tampon for his (frequent) nosebleeds he looked at me like I was an alien. Now he has his own tampons in his work bag."]}
