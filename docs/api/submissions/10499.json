{"id": 10499, "submission_id": "117pcmt", "title": "AITA for keeping my period products out in the open and not away in a cabinet?", "selftext": "So my bf (M22) and I (F21) recently moved in together. In our bathroom, I have a basket of pads, tampons, and panty liners on a shelf near the toilet. The only cabinets and draws in the bathroom are too far away from the toilet for me to reach while sitting on it, so the main reason I did this was so that I could change my products more easily. It also makes them more accessible for guests. That way if someone comes over and needs a pad or tampon, they won\u2019t have to go digging through our cabinets and draws to find one. My bf\u2019s brother (M26) came over today to see our apartment. After using the bathroom, he complained about my period products being out in the open and said I should put them away because \u201cnobody wants to see that\u201d.  But I don\u2019t think he has the right to come into my apartment and tell me where to put my stuff. My bf told him \u201cWhen you start menstruating, you can tell her where to put her products.\u201d and he got mad and said \u201cNobody needs to know whether a woman menstruates or not and nobody needs to see her products.\u201d I genuinely don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so disgusting about seeing a wrapped, unused, period product in someone\u2019s bathroom.", "created_utc": 1676939064, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117pcmt/aita_for_keeping_my_period_products_out_in_the/", "score": 247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
