{"id": 10499, "submission_id": "117pcmt", "title": "AITA for keeping my period products out in the open and not away in a cabinet?", "selftext": "So my bf (M22) and I (F21) recently moved in together. In our bathroom, I have a basket of pads, tampons, and panty liners on a shelf near the toilet. The only cabinets and draws in the bathroom are too far away from the toilet for me to reach while sitting on it, so the main reason I did this was so that I could change my products more easily. It also makes them more accessible for guests. That way if someone comes over and needs a pad or tampon, they won\u2019t have to go digging through our cabinets and draws to find one. My bf\u2019s brother (M26) came over today to see our apartment. After using the bathroom, he complained about my period products being out in the open and said I should put them away because \u201cnobody wants to see that\u201d.  But I don\u2019t think he has the right to come into my apartment and tell me where to put my stuff. My bf told him \u201cWhen you start menstruating, you can tell her where to put her products.\u201d and he got mad and said \u201cNobody needs to know whether a woman menstruates or not and nobody needs to see her products.\u201d I genuinely don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so disgusting about seeing a wrapped, unused, period product in someone\u2019s bathroom.", "created_utc": 1676939064, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117pcmt/aita_for_keeping_my_period_products_out_in_the/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How is this different from seeing toilet paper in the bathroom?", "Nta 100%.  Your bf's brother is extremely immature.  By his logic, we shouldn't have toilet paper out in the open because \"no one wants to know when he takes a shit.\"  He's an idiot.", "NTA\n\nShout out to your boyfriend, he definitely passed the test.\n\nHis brother is a misogynist, so feel free to disregard any opinion that he has ever, he would disregard yours.", "NTA and your BFs brother needs to grow TF up.", "NTA, your house, your rules. Plus its a major red flag on your boyfriend's brothers part that he feels threatened by a tampon lmao", "NTA Since when did feminine hygiene products become more offensive than paper you use to wipe you backside after a bowel movement? Does he walk around with a crusty honey hole because toilet paper is \"embarrassing\".", "NTA. Of course there\u2019s nothing wrong or disgusting about it! At least your boyfriend gets it.", "Your BF sounds like a gem, his brother sounds like the younger sibling. \n\nNTA", "I think your basket is a solid solution and your reasoning is sound, and helpful!\n\nWhatever made that man so upset is a him problem. \n\nNTA not one bit.", "NTA\n\n100% of the people living in the apartment approve of this practical and convenient way to store period supplies. What your boyfriend's brother thinks is irrelevant and it's way ruder to lecture someone on how to handle their period (or how to organize their bathroom) than it is to cause someone's eyes to briefly encounter a tampon or pad staged for future use.", "Nta. Your boyfriends brother needs to grow up. Good on your boyfriend for standing up for you.\n\n\nNo woman should ever feel ashamed for her period.", "NTA: Your boyfriend responded to that wonderfully! I'm so glad he is on your side and took care of this situation. As a woman, I always keep some pads on the back of the toilet in a basket for easy reach. If you only brought them out when it's that time of the month, then it would be OBVIOUS, which would probably annoy your bf's brother even more. He has no right to dictate where you keep your feminine products in your own home. I can only imagine how he would be if he ends up in a relationship with a woman who gets her periods. Yikes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Grammar fixed", "NTA\n\nBF is pretty awesome to shut him down like that!", "NTA - chase the idiot around with an opened tampon it should be entertaining. \n\nGlad your partner gets it.", "Tell him to F off! He can have a say when it\u2019s his bathroom. Thank you for being considerate.\n*at least we know he doesn\u2019t creep around women\u2019s restrooms or he would know this is normal.", "NTA it's your and your boyfriend's place you do as you want. His brother is being childish and rude. Personally I keep things tucked away but thats my house. You do you in your house, you know?", "NTA you kidding me.It\u2019s your apartment and why would we (girls) put the products where we can\u2019t reach\u2026. That\u2019s just really inconvenient. Man these guys are idiots getting mad at such small thing. Tell them to suck it", "NTA. Any woman would greatly appreciate you leaving products out for others and I totally get the ease of access reason. Some men are so weird with menstruation and I truly don\u2019t know why.", "NTA. \n\nIt's extremely odd to say where someone can place stuff in their own home. Besides that, I'm flabbergasted someone is that weird about periods/products. Even male student housing I've stayed had tampons on their bathroom shelves for guests to use.", "NTA. He has no idea what a period is or how inconvenient they can be. Tell him he shouldn't have toilet paper out next time you're at his place.", "Sounds like he's just really immature and can't handle the fact that you menstruate and want your products where they're the most convenient for you. NTA and he needs to grow up", "I think you already know that you\u2019re NTA, and your BF\u2019s brother is just misogynistic. Thumbs up for your BF for standing up to him, although even if his brother menstruated, he would still have no say in where you put your personal hygiene products since *he doesn\u2019t live there*. I\u2019d say he needs to grow up, but it\u2019s not an issue with age.", "NTA.", "Not even his place, NTA, tell the brother pay your rent and he gets a say in how the place is setup, otherwise stfu. He\u2019s the AH.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s hilarious \u201cWell I don\u2019t need to know you shit either so better hide the toilet paper\u201d If wants to come over he can go walk elsewhere to find a bathroom to his liking.", "NTA.\n\nI will never understand why some men are uncomfortable with period products...this coming from a man.\n\nIf he is 22 and still have an issue with periods and stuff then he shouldn\u2019t have a girlfriend, shouldn\u2019t move in together, and god forbid he has a daughter and it that time comes she has her first period; will he freak out then?", "NTA - Opinions are like a$$holes. And your boyfriends brother sounds like an a$$hole.", "NTA and a rare shoutout to the bf!", "NTA. Does this guy also object to toilet paper being left out where everyone can see it, on the basis that \u2018nobody needs to know that men shit\u2019?", "Next time he comes over, hide the toilet paper since that's used for wiping asses and nobody wants to see that.", "Your bf's brother is a good example of tell me you're an incel without telling me you are an incel.", "NTA tell your boyfriend he gets an A+ for his brothers stupid comment.", "Your boyfriend\u2019s brother doesn\u2019t want to see something that has Tampax or Kotex on it? It offends him? It\u2019s your bathroom. Tell him to take an education course and get over it. \nYNTA", "NTA \n\nI love how your bf totally defended you and told his brother off \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA your bfs brother is a loser", "NTA. BF put it pretty succinctly. Your house, your bathroom, your uterus.", "No nobody NEEDS to see them that\u2019s true, but nobody else gets to tell you how to arrange your apartment or house either. I am more reserved about this than most women so mine has always been put away in a cupboard but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong either. I love your boyfriend\u2019s response to his brother. I will be stealing that from him if anyone ever complains to me about such things. Definitely NTA. Quite apparently your boyfriend doesn\u2019t mind so there\u2019s no reason not to keep them where you need it at.", "NTA.  \n\nFunny how hes the older brother, but your boyfriend has more lived experience and wisdom than him.", "I \u2764\ufe0f your bf\u2019s response!", "NTA  Wait untill you leak on the bedsheets. That shows the men from the boys.", "Nta. Your bf is 1000% right. I do the same thing in my home because I have a similar obstacle of my cabinets and drawers not being near the toliet.", "Even if he walked in on a bloody toilet he'd have been overreacting. At least in that case I'd understand it being gross. It's embarrassing for him to be an adult man and still be treating periods like some dirty secret. NTA.", "NTA. And your BF gets it - kudos to him! His brother on the other hand\u2026is apparently traumatized by visible tampons? \n\nHe might wanna get that checked out.", "NTA and also your boyfriend sounds excellent.", "NTA and feel free to offer to accommodate his discomfort by pointing him toward the nearest gas station whenever he needs to use the toilet while visiting.", "NTA also A+ response from your bf", "NTA", "NTA, your boyfriend\u2019s brother ITAH. Slam dunk, take your puritanical misogyny somewhere else if you don\u2019t like it.", "NTA. There's nothing gross about it. I'm glad ypur boyfriend stood up for you and I'm sorry his older brother acted like such a little baby.", "NTA at all", "Ugh, a childish 26 year old. How annoying. Would ask him where he hides his tampons next time I'm over at his place. NTA.", "NTA sounds like your boyfriend is immature are you sure you wanna be with a scoundrel like him?", "Came here to say this exact thing!!!", "Because men are supposed to be using it too!", "Toxic masculinity embodied, hope the BF doesn\u2019t have any of that.", "Ah, but if men need it/do it then it's normal and totally fine.....", "Ikr, it\u2019s kinda sad that the younger brother is more mature than the older brother", "It's the BF's brother that has the issue and he doesn't even live there.", "Wait until he becomes a dad and his hormonal, exhausted wife is leaking everything everywhere!", "(BFs brother, not BF. Friend)"]}
