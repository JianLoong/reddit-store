I'd ditch her.", "NTA. \n\nHe's saying he's reformed because he's involved in a court case with a previous employer, and that looks good. He'll revert to his natural form once his legal troubles are over.", "NTA. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "NTA Your friend is pretty gullible if she thinks he really has no way to access his own social media accounts to delete the videos.", "NTA I have to wonder what he considers \u201creformed.\u201d Public apologies? Being actively anti-racist and working against white supremacy? Friend either had their head buried in the sand, on some level shared some of those beliefs, and/or doesn\u2019t think white supremacy is a big deal. Or maybe just desperate. Imagine settling for a white supremacist, ew.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that people can change. But with the information given, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s done the work to change.", "NTA\n\nThe lack of public apology or recant says it all.

Looking like your friend is a bit naive or she's not who you think she is \ud83d\ude23 \n\nHe's not reformed unless he's actively anti-racist. Don't let him know where you live.", "NTA.   It says a whole lot about your friend that this wasn't a deal breaker for her.

I\u2019d drop the friend as well.", "NTA but probably will hurt that friendship. F supremacists", "NTA. Your friend is blinded by this guy's behaviour, which is likely to not be all that reformed, although it could be, but I doubt it.

Just move on with your merry life.", "NTA and I suggest you look up Derek Black, who comes from a family of white nationalists (he\u2019s David Duke\u2019s godson) and was involved in white nationalism from a young age. He is no longer a white nationalist but he actively denounces his former beliefs. Has this guy done the same? It doesn\u2019t seem like he has.

And if you turn out to be right, you won't be there to help her.\n\nI don't mean that in a \"bend over backwards to accomodate him\" way. Boundaries need to be stated and respected.

Plus, just because someone changed it doesn't mean that they're deserving of forgiveness.", "I mean.. if you don\u2019t offer people an avenue for redemption, how exactly do you expect to fix the problem? \n\nYou have to be accepting of change, otherwise the only chance of acceptance is to double down on the hateful rhetoric. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to like him but you\u2019re not doing yourself, or your cause, any favors by actively shunning him. Daryl Davis converted more neo-Nazi\u2019s by hugging them over a beer than shouting \u201cbash the fasc\u201d ever did.\n\nNAH because your feelings are your feelings, he\u2019s not an asshole if he\u2019s actually trying to change, and your friend isn\u2019t an asshole for wanting her friends to like - or at least pretend to like - her boyfriend.", "YTA poll some guys who have what your friend ostensibly wants.  You should find your opinions are not universal.   If you want to deal with men, you've got to learn to tolerate them.", "NTA-he's trying to pretend to be reformed because of the impending lawsuits.", "NTA - if she\u2019s dating with him knowing who he is do you really want to continue being friends with her ?   \nLike you said he\u2019s still suing \nIt doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s changed \nYet she\u2019s dating him anyway \nDo you really think you\u2019ll be able to be kept apart from him all the time ?", "*Am I the asshole for saying I will not like him?*\n\nWhy waste your time? I'd distance myself completely.", "NTA, I\u2019d drop her, which I understand isn\u2019t an everyone friendly solution but no way is my friend dating someone who was involved in the fucking insurrection bro", "Oh wow NTA. He's still suing for wrongful termination he's not reformed. \n\nI'd tell friend not only do I not like him, I will no longer associate with her.", "so, he's a moderate republican it sounds like.  nta.", "NTA. Forgiveness is a gift, not an obligation. Even if he is reformed (which, for the reasons you listed, is a big 'if'), he's not owed a second chance.", "NTA. Trump supporters are incapable of change. He is evil, and he always will be.", "Is your friend desperate, stupid, or both?", "NTA if he was sincere he would remove the videos and make an apology video. Maybe even a warning video for young men on how to avoid the white supremest traps online. (Also a video on how he fell into the Jan 6th riot, regrets it & feels like an idiot.)", "As a former racist, I didn't change overnight. It takes a long time and it takes drastic life changes. Also, fugg my parents for teaching me that shit. I wouldn't accept him on the fact that he was in the insurrection before even considering the other crap.", "NTA. Good on you OP!", "That's a line of the month contender there", "An award to you for that last line. Brava!", "\ud83c\udfc6", "Isn\u2019t the FBI accepting tips or leads on anyone involved?\n\nI\u2019m just saying\u2026", "Agreed. Those monsters made me feel ashamed to be an American.", "Yup. There are reformed ones out there but they've been doing the work for YEARS, not just a few months of lip service to look good for a trial.", "wow, you compare sex workers to neo-nazi terrorists?", "the fact that he's suing because he was fired for participating in a violent coup tells you he hasn't changed, he's a liar.  \n\n\nif he had changed, he would accept the consequences of his actions because he recognized he had done wrong.", "But what justification can he have that he shouldn\u2019t have been fired for comments he made about Jan 6 or white supremacy that isn\u2019t him saying those things are ok to say?", "If he felt true remorse for his past beliefs, he would accept and understand that he lost a substantial amount of salary for good reason. Usually, when someone recognizes that they've done something wrong, they accept the consequences because they know that they deserve it. His actions come across as if he is pretending to disavow white supremacy because he doesn't want to affect his social/professional life anymore. Not because he genuinely no longer believes it.", "so he thinks he was wrongfully fired for his views? Which means he doesn't think his views are wrong. **which means he's still a white supremacist.**", "nah tolerating nazis is not the same as tolerating men.", "How has he changed if he's still going through with suing his employer? And this guy is not owed a chance just because he decided to change after creating, inciting and encouraging racial violence against others. Plenty of horrible people can say that they've changed, but that doesn't change the impact of what they have done, nor does it erase it.", "People can change, but making up for extraordinary hatred requires extraordinary effort. Not even bothering to get the videos taken down or making new videos about his reformed views says it all about how seriously he's taking this. The fact that he has a pending lawsuit hanging in the balance is probably his real motivation", "Why do they need to accept him as change without proof they don\u2019t deserve to meet me unless I feel safe around them and a white supremacist and a Jan 6th supporter would not be someone I feel\nComfortable around and I am white man. \nThe man is in a suit about getting fired for his beliefs he clearly believes them enough to sue a company over firing him for them. \nIf he didn\u2019t actually believe that stuff he would say \u201cyou know what I fucked up I was wrong to post that stuff I should take it down. He wouldn\u2019t keep it up with some bullshit excuse he can\u2019t take it down, he would be suing a company for wrongful firing because of those beliefs. \nLook a persons actions don\u2019t just listen to their words.", "He's still suing his employees for firing him for participating in Jan 6, how has he really changed? Also, I'm not sure if OP is a minority but if they are, you and no one else, have the right to tell them how they should feel about someone who has spewed vitriolic hate online. As OP said, this person has not done enough to show that they have really changed, so they are not owed OP's friendship.", " Time to change his name, then. That's not a joke.", "Exactly. Wouldn't want to be with anyone that stupid.", "Yup, the whole thing is if 9 people sit down at a table with one nazi, really there are 10 nazis at the table.\n\nOPs friend and gone deep into white supremacist territory and is happy to lie to friends who wouldn't like it, over time she'd try to push you towards the same ideals. \n\nShould there be room for people who actually change, sure, with caution, but if you look up the guy and all you can find are hate speech videos he's obviously put zero effort into taking down and is still suing over being fairly fired for hate speech and involvement in Jan 6th then he hasn't changed, she knows this, she's enabling him.\n\nI'd dump the friend and tell her exactly why.", "Definitely both.", "Facts! He has accepted no responsibility for the harm he's caused, hasn't even acknowledged that he's caused harm. Just running his mouth because no self respecting woman would give him the time of day if he told them he still believes in all the awful things he's said and done.", "There's a great scene in the movie Twelve Angry Men where someone is spewing racist garbage and everyone stands up and turns away from him.", "Sounds like she has a Savior Complex.", "NTA op. If he really has changed and embarrassed to see himself in those videos he would find a way to get them taken down and would agree with his termination for hate speech. Especially as he is likely making money off those videos.", "Wouldn't doubt if the BF plans to use OP's friend as a character witness.  So he's doing whatever he can to convince her he's changed. \n\nIf I were OP, I'd caution my friend to not get involved with any of his legal issues.", "not only has he not accepted responsibility, he's trying to sue to undo the consequences of participating in a violent coup. which means he stands by what he did.", "o yes never thought o f that angle either.  i hope the op tells the friend to stay out of the legal issues.", "If they can still say that they meant it at the time of sentencing, it\u2019s not perjury. It\u2019s not illegal to change your mind, after the fact. Many convicted prisoners regret taking a plea deal instead of trying their luck at trial, but unless they have a large budget for legal fees, they take what they can get.", "Probably both", "Exactly. He doesn't like the consequences of his own actions. Bet on his strong ties to the same groups and working on the plan for the next coup attempt."]}
