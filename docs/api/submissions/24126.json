He has told her that he has changed and doesn\u2019t believe anything he had said prior and he claims that he can\u2019t get into his account to delete all of the hate speech videos.

I\u2019ve told her that I am just not going to like him.

That shit was extremely recent, and there\u2019s fair reason to doubt he\u2019s actually changed.\n\nYour friend has incorrectly interpreted the phrase, \u201cFuck Nazis\u201d", "NTA - I'd be worried he plays \"reformed person\" just to win the lawsuit.", "NTA.\n\nHe is lying. You can make a petition to have the videos deleted even if you don't have access to your account. He is likely still active in the community or generates revenue from the videos. He likely isn't reformed at all and is just saying that he is because he wants to get laid and no one wants to fuck a white supremacist.", "NTA. Involved in Jan 6th is all I need to know. That\u2019s not \u201coh I\u2019ve reformed\u201d territory.", "NTA. You're friend is a closet white supremacist or just plain, fucking stupid. I'd ditch her.", "NTA. \n\nHe's saying he's reformed because he's involved in a court case with a previous employer, and that looks good. He'll revert to his natural form once his legal troubles are over.", "NTA. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "NTA Your friend is pretty gullible if she thinks he really has no way to access his own social media accounts to delete the videos.", "NTA I have to wonder what he considers \u201creformed.\u201d Public apologies? Being actively anti-racist and working against white supremacy? Friend either had their head buried in the sand, on some level shared some of those beliefs, and/or doesn\u2019t think white supremacy is a big deal. Or maybe just desperate. Imagine settling for a white supremacist, ew.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that people can change. But with the information given, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s done the work to change.", "NTA\n\nThe lack of public apology or recant says it all. If he meant it, he\u2019d mean it publicly.\n\nAnd he\u2019d be doing a lot more than shrugging his shoulders about not being able to get into his accounts to delete the videos.", "Say no to nazis. NTA", "I don\u2019t know this guy, or his extremes, but I can tell you that if he has changed, he\u2019d likely understand your attitude. Nta-if change is genuine, he doesn\u2019t like his former self either", "Nta but I would not be friends with someone dating a white supremacists. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t care if you say your reformed unless I see you do mean full change and denounce everthing you said in the past publicly for all to hear you ain\u2019t getting shit from me and I would not feel comfortable around that friend. And I\u2019m betting your friend is a white liberal?", "NTA I think you are on to something and his \"reformed\" beliefs are just an act. You can always find a way into an account... if he'd actually changed he wouldn't want any of that stuff associated with him.", "Hundres of videos? Jan.6? everything still up? Tell your friend she don't need your aproval and you don't have to give it and you hope she's right.", "NTA. People don't get totally locked out of online accounts these days, generally not ones they were attached to enough to use their real faces. If you forgot the password, you have the email, ND anything you post videos on usually has a backup contact number too. He's not putting up an apology because he doesn't want to, not because he can't. And he's still suing, which tells me he ar least thinks that hate speech shouldn't be a big enough deal to get fired for, even if he's stepping away from it.", "NTA\n\nHe's also misleading your friend, or at least your friend is willing to be misled.", "NTA. Looking like your friend is a bit naive or she's not who you think she is \ud83d\ude23 \n\nHe's not reformed unless he's actively anti-racist. Don't let him know where you live.", "NTA.   It says a whole lot about your friend that this wasn't a deal breaker for her.  If it was someone who had disavowed their former belief after a long reflection and counseling and it was in the past that would be one thing.   Someone who is still dealing with immediate consequences of their hatred?  And is possibly still facing legal consequences for trying to overthrow the government?  That's some real poor decision making on her part...", "NTA. People can and do change, and I think that is important to realize. However, it sounds like he was a whole other breed. Still suing his former company, involvement in January 6th, and not actively trying to undo the harm he's done online are key signs he really hasn't changed nearly as much as he has to.\n\nI'm curious about your friend's values if she thinks this is an attractive romantic partner", ">My friend did not want to tell me his history because she knew it would taint\\^H\\^H\\^H\\^H\\^Hinform my view of him.\n\nFTFY.\n\nNTA.  Even if he is completely \"reformed\" that is quite a past.  Can the dude even articulate what is different, what drove him to express those views in the past and what changed?", "NTA. I\u2019d drop the friend as well.", "NTA but probably will hurt that friendship. F supremacists", "NTA. Your friend is blinded by this guy's behaviour, which is likely to not be all that reformed, although it could be, but I doubt it. You've said your piece, and all you can do is hope that she's either right that he's changed, or hope that she's not damaged by the aftermath.", "NTA", "NTA - You can like or dislike, associate or dissociate from whomever you'd like. Just move on with your merry life.", "NTA and I suggest you look up Derek Black, who comes from a family of white nationalists (he\u2019s David Duke\u2019s godson) and was involved in white nationalism from a young age. He is no longer a white nationalist but he actively denounces his former beliefs. Has this guy done the same? It doesn\u2019t seem like he has. It\u2019s one thing to say you\u2019re no longer a white supremacist, but he actually has to own up to it instead of just saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter anymore\u201d", "NTA\n\nI will not brook a Nazi or white supremacists either. \n\nI would still advise caution. Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. And I'm not talking about the new man here, but about your friend. If you draw a line in the sand, you run the risk of alienating her. And if you turn out to be right, you won't be there to help her.\n\nI don't mean that in a \"bend over backwards to accomodate him\" way. Boundaries need to be stated and respected. But relationships are tricky. How much do you value this friendship? What's the most important thing to you here? Is your friend changing because of this relationship?", "Nta racist ppl don't change your never the asshole against racist ppl", "That's rough buddy", "> I understand that people grow and change but if he is still suing for wrongful termination for \u201cfree speech\u201d how much has he really changed? \n\n He lost a substantial amount of salary and is trying to recoup it. I don't think that's a sign he believes in white supremacy. \n\nI'd also be concerned that he's just lying to her if his social media is still intact, but you won't actually know until you meet the guy.", "I\u2019m sure", "You\u2019re the asshole because you\u2019re not even giving him a chance after he\u2019s changed", "People have the capacity to change and some really want it. Maybe he has made real efforts. This guy sounds like an asshole for his beliefs, YTA for not giving someone the grace to change.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I doubt he is reformed if he won\u2019t put in more effort to delete the videos, issue a public apology, or quit pursuing the lawsuit.  He\u2019s probably starting to recognize that actions have consequences and is becoming more conscious of his public persona.  If he was truly regretful, he\u2019d put in considerably more effort.", "He has done no work to make amends, not even a public apology, despite his offenses being extremely serious--he didn't just fall for that shit or go along with a bad friend group, he made a podcast and participated in a violent attack on all of us.\n\nYou are NTA for refusing to give him a chance. Your friend defending him is inexcusable. I know it's easy for me to sit here and type this since it's not my life and not my friendship, but IMO you should cut her out of your life at this point. Honestly, if I were friends with YOU, and you remained friends with her, and she continued in this way, I would cut you out of my life.", "NTA- she\u2019s being a fool because he has not changed. Let\u2019s hope she catches on before she gets in too deep.", "You have no reason to believe he's changed. It's a lot easier for this person to hide his true beliefs if he's been let go of his main gig spewing hate speech. I wouldn't trust this person as far as I could throw him. You don't owe her anything and she's honestly an idiot or has poor morals herself for trusting him blindly. Makes my skin crawl. NTA.\n\nEdit", "NTA. \n\nYou are right about him suing his employer- people who truly want forgiveness or to atone for how they were, don't continue to push for how they were wronged for being held accountable for what they did. \n\nAnd let's say he is truly sorry and changed, so what? He participated in a violent protest, held views and supported people who were actively violent and hostile to multiple types of people who live in America. He actively supported views of those who have killed, harassed, and harmed people of color. You don't have to accept that he is changed and a good person, you can decide you are all set from accepting someone like that in your life, and you certainly don't have to like him. \n\nSure, if this was 20 years from now and he had a track record of being a good person, I'd feel differently. But this is still pretty fresh, he is still suing, and like you said, she is choosing this person, not you, and there's no reason you need to accept him.", "Your friends probably a racist herself", "NTA. Has he had any tattoos removed or covered? If not, has he discussed any plans to do so?", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't matter what he says. It's two simple questions to put an end to the conversation.\n\nWhat is he doing to make amends to everyone he has hurt?\nWhat is he doing to combat the further spread of hate speech?\n\nHis answer will likely out his intentions.", "If a group of friends hang out all the time and one of them is a white supremacist, how many are racist?  (Spoiler, all of them).  \nThere\u2019s no way he doesn\u2019t have access to his social media to take that crap down. He likes it there. He wants it there.
