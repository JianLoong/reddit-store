One of her dumb decisions led to my nephew who is now 2 years old. I put aside my differences with my sister and have an amazing relationship with him. I babysit him all the time and come to play with him while my sister sleeps (she works overnights). \n\nMy issue is that my parents and sister want me to give up my car to her so that she can have a safer car since hers is old and keeps breaking down. My car is something I worked my ass off for and I really don\u2019t want to give it up. My parents bought it for me as a birthday gift since my grades had been so well throughout high school and I got into a very good college.

It's an essential piece of your plan for independence and a better life!  There's no reason on earth for you to do that to yourself. No matter how much of yourself you give to your greedy sister, she will always want more. Don't let her get away with gaslighting you about how you brought all this bad stuff into her life!", "NTA.\n\nIt's your car.\n\nAnd be sure they don't have the keys to it, because I wouldn't put it out of possibility for them to just take it.\n\nIn which case, call the cops.", "Nta. Please don't let her guilt trip you into it. You earned it. If she wants one, let her bf get a job & buy her one. The fact they would guilt trip you is enough of a reason to say no. Tell her if she keeps it up, you wont be babysitting anymore either (trust me, she may try to bluff you for a moment but once she knows your serious, she won't want to jeopardize a free sitter)", "NTA. Give her nothing. Take her nowhere.", "NTA. Just because she had a child doesn't mean she gets special treatment.", "NTA. It's your name on the title and I presume you're paying insurance. Just like how you worked your a$$ off to get nice things, so can your sister. Your parents are enabling her to be a brat. She's not entitled to your gains. Her work availability is overnight? Well she needs to hunt for a better paying overnight job. And she and the BF are texting you too?! Tell them to either combine their monies together along with sis' car, trade it in for something that works or come up with the money to buy your car at KBB Value. But DO NOT GIVE IN AND GIVE FREELY!! Actions. Have. Consequences.", "NTA it is not your responsibility to care for you nephew in anyway", "Yes, because what's next? You buy a nice home and then they say you must let them have it/rent it cheap because you are only 1 person and they are 3? With having a child you have the responsibility to provide for them.", "I think the parents are on OPs side, she's just projecting her (unwarranted) guilty feelings onto them. Like, if they wanted to buy the sister the car they could've given it to her and not OP, or even not put it in OP's name only.", "actually it\u2019s her parents car, she did not buy it", "I'm so confused about the finances here. OP is 18 so I'm assuming she's had the car no more than 2 years. So parents had the funds to get OP a brand new car less than 24 months ago but somehow the sister's only options are \"shitbox that barely runs\" and \"OP just hands over her own vehicle\". \n\nThe parents can't help the sister buy a newer but still second hand car? Give her a deposit for some finance? Who tf just asks for someone's car?", "It\u2019s in her name and she pays the insurance.", "No it sounds like she never would've met their standards for grades to get a car. She didn't do well in school...so a high GPA reward was never in the cards", "NTA and frankly your nephews safety is not even you parents responsibility it's your sisters who decided to get pregnant at 19. \n\nLet her suffer the consequences of her decision and don't let them bully you into giving the car. Very frankly I'd rather you smash the car than give it to an entitled loser.", "Oh, your parents will probably threaten to kick you out, to stop supporting you financially etc. if you don't relent. Or they will just take the car keys when you are asleep and give them to your sister.\n\nSadly, your sister is the golden child now, because she gave your parents a grandbaby. You no longer matter to them. :(", "OP got nice car from the sounds of it, and will have half of college paid. Does sister get any money for anything? Let OP keep the car and parents use some of college money to buy sister one. Otherwise they are continuing to punish sister for actions she could well regret. ETA, and parents are putting sister's against each other by telling OP that it is her choice, then encouraging her to give it to sister. Now that I think about it, they are probably giving sister financial support. They need to figure out what they can reasonably give each daughter and not make it all about rewards and punishments for good and bad behavior.", "I would probably stop babysitter for her too. Her sister is trying to guilt and bully her out of car. That\u2019s some serious entitlement. OP put aside their differences to help her out and her sister still isn\u2019t satisfied."]}
