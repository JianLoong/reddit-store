I only hung out with a few friends and spent my free time either studying or playing sports throughout high school. While my sister struggled in school and hung out with the wrong people and got into some very bad stuff. This didn\u2019t make her a bad person but it made her make some very dumb decisions. One of her dumb decisions led to my nephew who is now 2 years old. I put aside my differences with my sister and have an amazing relationship with him. I babysit him all the time and come to play with him while my sister sleeps (she works overnights). \n\nMy issue is that my parents and sister want me to give up my car to her so that she can have a safer car since hers is old and keeps breaking down. My car is something I worked my ass off for and I really don\u2019t want to give it up. My parents bought it for me as a birthday gift since my grades had been so well throughout high school and I got into a very good college. I spent countless nights staying up till 3am studying, gave up on time with my friends and bf just so that I could keep my grades up. Honestly I view this car as my baby and a product of my hard work.\n\nMy sister has been texting me all week about it and her boyfriend too. She has been telling me it\u2019s only fair since I was the reason our parents never paid attention to her and just because I got good grades doesn\u2019t mean I deserve the car. She told me i\u2019d be putting her son in danger if I kept making them drive their unsafe car. My parents told me it\u2019s completely my decision but I can feel that they want me to give it to her. I know they most likely can\u2019t afford a brand new and even slightly used car now, especially since they are going to help pay half of my college.\n\nI understand that she needs a safer car but I don\u2019t feel like it should be my responsibility to provide it for her. Like I said I worked so hard for it and I\u2019ll be left carless if I do let her have it. I want my nephew to be safe but shouldn\u2019t that be my parents job not mine.
