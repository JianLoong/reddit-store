So basically, you passed down the part of the appearance genetics that looks like your brother, but you didn\u2019t pass down the part that looks like you so much. At least not in terms of coloring.  Or, if you did pass it down, something stopped it from expressing, and made this part express instead.\n\nI read that we don\u2019t pass down all of our genetic information to our children. Only half of the genetic information in the child is from each parent, so not all of your genetic information can fit inside him.  It\u2019s also well known that darker hair and eyes and skin are dominant genetically over fairer coloring.\n\nSo if he inherited the darker coloring from you, and the darker color was dominant over the genes from his father, this would be the outcome. You don\u2019t have to fuck your brother to be carrying similar genetics, but not outwardly expressing all of them in your own body.  If you\u2019ll pardon the expression. I\u2019ve also heard that there are some components of genetics that expressed differently, depending on gender. Your son and your brother were both men.\n\nNTA, obviously", "NTA!

The MIL is sick.", "My son looks like my brother and his da mixed so should I assume they messed around and I had the baby? NTA MIL is insane!", "NTA. My daughter and my cousin's daughter (who are I forget how many years apart) look like they could be sisters. My children's baby pictures and mine look so much alike that unless you know which picture you are looking at you will mistake one for another.", "NTA. If I was you, I would have called her way worst things then you called her. You made a very adult choice to just leave.", "NTA.  Does she not realize you and your brother have a lot of the same genes and it makes sense that your son could look like any of your relatives?", "My brother is a dead ringer for one of my mom's brother's. Our sister, his twin, is a dead ringer for one of my dad's aunts. Genetics are weird.", "NTA but she must have a lot of resentment towards you to be that disgusting with gross insinuations.\n\nMy friend has a son who looks and acts exactly like her deceased brother. Genetics are like that.", "NTA she\u2019s absolutely disgusting, I\u2019d go NC after that. There is nothing that she can say that will excuse what she said.", "Mother in law is batshit crazyy. Your husband needs to tell her stop. Why isn't he protecting his wife and child from this. \n\nNTA. But you have a husband problem.", "NTA this is bizarre and I am glad your husband supporting you so far and I hope he does not make you go near this woman ever again!", "NTA. Holy disgusting thoughts Batman! \n\nYeah I\u2019d not only have burned that bridge it would be nuked into orbit.", "Tell her to lay off the daytime television. NTA", "NTA what on earth is wrong with her???", "NTA- I would literally never speak to her again.", "Honestly, some people are born to be ignorant idiots. You could have them research about a topic all their lives and they\u2019d still say some nonsense like they\u2019re right. But, you\u2019re correct. She\u2019s definitely disgusting and sick in the head.", "Obviously your MIL is both the e AH and completely ignorant of how genetics works. My dad looked nothing like his dad but was the spitting image of his uncle (who had also passed well before he was born) but guess what, his dad was was most definitely the father.\n\nNTA.", "NTA she clearly doesn\u2019t understand how genetics work. My great grandma is the only redhead in my family, yet two of my cousins from different siblings have red hair. Do people call incest??? No because they know genes can be recessive. What an AH and an idiot", "NTA. Seriously genetics can really be weird. One of my sons strongly resembles my grandmother\u2019s brother, who died decades before I was born. It\u2019s so disturbing that her mind went to incest and not \u201cHey, genetics!\u201d", "NTA. MIL is disgusting. In front of the grandkids no less. I would done with her period.", "All of its appalling, but the cherry on top of the already disgusting accusations of her having an incestuous AFFAIR with her brother, is that she was a predator and had said affair with her brother that is 10 years her junior. That woman is nuts!", "NTA. Not at all. Your MIL is simply disgusting and ignorant. This is how genetics work. \n\nI recently reconnected with my estranged sister. My teenage nephew who I haven't seen since he was about three is almost exactly like me. It was almost spooky. We look the same, think the same, and even have some of the same medical conditions.  It never in a million years would cross anyone's mind what your MIL suggested. Eww.", "Is your husband Danny Fenton?", "NTA- what is wrong with her? My brother and I look very similar because we are related. We also have a much younger cousin who looks like us as well because that\u2019s how genetics works!", "NTA if I were you talk to your husband and low/no contact with her and and send her her a science book about genetics and how it works.", "NTA. She ignorant of how genetics actually works. And she's not willing to educate herself on it, instead she's chosen the most disgusting response ever. Do not apologize.", "NTA my son looks nothing like me or his sperm donor he is a carbon copy of my little brother. Everyone thought he was my brothers kid when he was out with my mom and personality is super similar. \n\nMy mom had super genes when it comes to boys they all look very similar as kids and I was the odd one out but you MIL is sick I\u2019m so sorry your dealing with this.", "MIL is gross and honestly... dumb. Does she understand biology? How family and traits and all of that work? NTA.", "So instead of grasping basic biology she instead decided to accuse you of sleeping with your brother and him fathering your child in front of your two children and other family members!?!? \n\nNo contact from this point forward is the only feasible solution. \n\nNTA", "NTA. My niece (sister\u2019s daughter) looks exactly like I did when I was a toddler and nothing like my sister. DNA is a strange thing.", "Meanwhile, in Alabama\u2026.", "> They like the same sports, have the same personality, style and my son\u2019s ex girlfriend looks exactly like my brother\u2019s ex girlfriend.\n\nSo what?? This is meaningless. YTA.", "Dear God, what is wrong with OP's MIL?! She clearly doesn't understand how genetics work. And it's disturbing enough for her to jump to this outrageous conclusion, but to make these comments in front of the child?!\n\nSo glad OP has her husband on her side, because it's time to go no contact. I'm desperately hoping they don't try low contact, especially since MIL is not only unapologetic but has the audacity to try and play the victim here.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "Good lord. NTA, OP. I would have lost it on her. What a disgusting thing to insinuate! And to say these things in front of your child?!? I'm livid for you and applaud your restraint.", "This ^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNTA\n\nMIL is a massive a*****e though! Massive! Yugeeee", "I would never go around this woman again", "At New Year\u2019s, actually. Brought that mess into 2023. Smh \nNTA.", "Idk why I was assuming mil thought she slept with her dad \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "Not even strange genetics. We have non-identical twin girls - one looks a lot more like me and my side of the family, the other clearly picked up a lot more from her mother's side, including looking a fair bit like her aunt at that age, more than her mother.\n\nOP's son is just visibly from his mother's side, nothing weird about that - kids often look similar to a close, or even not-so-close relative from either side. Though obviously the random jumble together does sometimes chuck up some odd surprises!\n\nThat MIL leapt to that means OP's son was fathered by her dead brother? What a weird and horrible thing to think, let alone say out loud!\n\nSoo NTA. OP, your MIL owes you a helluva more contrite apology than that, and you've nothing to apologise for.", "I\u2019m just trying to clarify that this isn\u2019t an issue for my husband at all despite what his mother believes.", "The thing about grandparents is definitely not true\u2014you have half your DNA from each of your parents, and on average 25% from each of your grandparents. But most physical traits in humans are complicated and affected by multiple interacting genes, so it is completely possible for physical resemblance to a grandparent or other family member to be particularly strong.", "I dunno my daughter looks exactly like my sister\u2026. Starting to wonder if maybe I\u2019m not her real mom after reading this post.", "You realized you were pregnant 6.months after his death? Him being the father would be quite the trick...", "Well originally OP didn\u2019t say how old she was and when she got pregnant, so when I was first reading it, i thought it was her older brother who died when OP was young.", "Here's my poor person's gold for that statement. \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "I look almost identical to a second cousin. Genetics are wild.", "Exactly. It's called DNA. MIL apparently doesn't understand how it works. My son looks like a mixture of all of my brothers and he looks nothing like his father. Oddly enough, he most closely resembles my little cousin, who is my mom's half-sister's son, even though they wouldn't share as much DNA. DNA is a crazy thing.", "My grandma looked nothing like her siblings - blond where they had black hair, green eyes instead of brown, etc.  Her parents said she resembled a distant cousin.  Well, I found an old photo of my Grandma\u2019s brother when he was a young man and he looked so much like my Dad\u2026 and later I did genetic testing that proved that I am second cousins with granddaughter of my Grandma\u2019s older sister.  Said sister had black curly hair, brown eyes, long face and was tall.  My Grandma was blond, green-eyes, didn\u2019t reach 5 feet and had round face.  Yeah.  Still sisters.  My Mom looks a lot more like her half-sister than her full sister.  My cousin is pretty much a clone of his father and grandfather.  I am a perfect blend of my parents features.  Genes are indeed funny.", "I look nothing like my brothers. They have 90% of my parents features in some combination. If you lined us up you'd never believe I was related to the rest. One is ginger, one is blonde and both have blue eyes. My hair and eyes are both deep black-brown and I'm three shades paler than they are. But I look exactly like paternal grandfather in everything but eye color. It happens.", "Right?  My mom has brown eyes, my dad has green eyes. They have zero children with brown or green eyes. One of my sibs has hazel, but that\u2019s the closest there is. My mom is also a red head and my dad has black hair. My sibs and I are all blonde. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Come to think of it, my son looks just like his Dad... maybe he's the mom and my husband cheated on me with himself!!!", "Thank you for that chuckle.", "Not to mention now re-thinking his whole relationship with his grandma, a person he once thought he could trust and love and has now revealed herself to be an unsafe haven.", "Yep. I look nothing like my mother or father, but before my transition, I was a carbon copy of my late aunt (on my dad's side), even have some of her habits, and fav animals.\n\nGenetics are wild.", "My husband and I have 2 boys. One looks exactly like my husband. My other looks like my cousins on my mother's side of the family- but I look like my dad. \n\nGenetics are weird man.", "I have a daguerrotype of my great great grandfather. It looks like a picture of my brother in 19th century costume.\n\nMy sister has one son who is the spitting image of his father but has her mannerisms. Her other son looks like her but acts just like his father.\n\nGenetics is weird. Mother in law is not just ignorant but completely disgusting.", "Same except for the jawline bit  he-he", "I look more like mother than my father. My daughter looks very much like my wife\u2019s cousin\u2019s daughter. Except she has the same color hair as my wife. Whose hair was golden blonde until she got pregnant, when it changed to the same red-blond/bronze color my daughter was born with. Oh but my daughter has eyes the same shade of blue as mine. And the same ultra-fair skin as my wife. (We jokingly say they aren\u2019t white \u2014 they\u2019re clear.)\n\nWild stuff.", "I don't look like either of my parents except for coloring. We all have light eyes and hair. But my brother and I used to look like twins when he was about 18 and I was in my 20s. He even got asked if he was the older one \ud83d\ude02"]}
