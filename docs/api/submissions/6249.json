A kid isn't formed from a gene puddle, it's a gene pool, preferably a nice deep one. Genetics are wild and wonderful and a total crapshoot. And how a person looks is only a fraction of their full genetic makeup. My grandparents were both brunette with dark eyes and wham bam my aunt came out strawberry blonde with blue eyes.

The sooner MIL understands this and how wrong she is to voice her opinions the better.", "As I understand it, all that would really need to happen is that the genes you passed down to your son were more dominant than the genes passed down by your husband.\n\nYou could be carrying the same genes that control appearance as your brother has, except that for you some different appearance genes were predominant. So basically, you passed down the part of the appearance genetics that looks like your brother, but you didn\u2019t pass down the part that looks like you so much. At least not in terms of coloring.  Or, if you did pass it down, something stopped it from expressing, and made this part express instead.\n\nI read that we don\u2019t pass down all of our genetic information to our children. Only half of the genetic information in the child is from each parent, so not all of your genetic information can fit inside him.  It\u2019s also well known that darker hair and eyes and skin are dominant genetically over fairer coloring.\n\nSo if he inherited the darker coloring from you, and the darker color was dominant over the genes from his father, this would be the outcome. You don\u2019t have to fuck your brother to be carrying similar genetics, but not outwardly expressing all of them in your own body.  If you\u2019ll pardon the expression. I\u2019ve also heard that there are some components of genetics that expressed differently, depending on gender. Your son and your brother were both men.\n\nNTA, obviously", "NTA!

I found out I was pregnant around 4 weeks along, so I know it\u2019s possible to find out really early.", "I was actually pretty far along. I can\u2019t recall perfectly but I was almost 4 or 5 months when I announced it.
