So basically, you passed down the part of the appearance genetics that looks like your brother, but you didn\u2019t pass down the part that looks like you so much. At least not in terms of coloring.  Or, if you did pass it down, something stopped it from expressing, and made this part express instead.\n\nI read that we don\u2019t pass down all of our genetic information to our children. Only half of the genetic information in the child is from each parent, so not all of your genetic information can fit inside him.  It\u2019s also well known that darker hair and eyes and skin are dominant genetically over fairer coloring.\n\nSo if he inherited the darker coloring from you, and the darker color was dominant over the genes from his father, this would be the outcome. You don\u2019t have to fuck your brother to be carrying similar genetics, but not outwardly expressing all of them in your own body.  If you\u2019ll pardon the expression. I\u2019ve also heard that there are some components of genetics that expressed differently, depending on gender. Your son and your brother were both men.\n\nNTA, obviously", "NTA!

My brother\u2019s kids also allllll looked exactly like him too. If I put pictures of all the kids as babies, I\u2019m pretty sure most would think they were siblings and not cousins. But ewwwww, no one would actually go *there*", "NTA. When is your MIL's birthday? Maybe you can gift her a genetics book?", "NTA, this\u2019s Jerry Springer/ Murray material.", "NTA. This is just mind blowing.. I look very similar to my aunt, and my niece looks more like she would be my child than my own sister, who is her mother. Looks like someone missed some basic biology classes..", "NTA", "NTA \n\nCould you not just get a paternity test and prove it to her beyond all doubt?\n\nI mean, I guess it\u2019s not strictly speaking necessary, you know you\u2019re innocent, your husband knows you\u2019re innocent, really this isn\u2019t something you should even \u201chave\u201d to prove. But in the name of getting your wretched MIL off your back a paternity test could be a good idea.", "Yeah that tends to happen in families it is called genetics \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 wow that woman is such a moron NTA", "Not Christmas, new years. So obviously accusing OP of an incestuous relationship and baby was the best way to ring in the new year! /s\n\nShe is  absolutely disgusting and warrants no further contact. NTA", "My mom has zero resemblance with her own sister but looks like the twin of her cousin. This has been pointed to her multiple times and she just laughs it off. \n\nThat's how genetics is. It's sad that some people are so ignorant and foolish like your MIL.\n\n Plus how hurtful she is to all of you in her own stupidity. NTA.", "\"Waaaaaah! Whaaaaaa! She had no RIGHT to insult me when I accused her of f*cking her brother! She owes me an apology!\" /s \n\nIn what narcissistic hellhole of delusion is she wallowing that SHE'S the victim? This is a no-contact type of accusation. Block her. Stop answering her or justifying yourself. She KNOWS she crossed a serious line and is full of narcissist regret: \"I'm sorry you got your feelings hurt. But, it's your fault for talking about your brother. APOLOGIZE TO ME!!\" So disgusting. If she doesn't like being called names, she shouldn't have started it. And, she's NOT sorry. NTA", "No no no. Not at Christmas at New Years. \ud83d\ude1d Ops MIL needs a crash course in genetics.", "Right? Sounds like she has said it before though. It should have been a cutoff after the first time. In some countries, it'd still be justifiable homicide to shoot her on the spot for that kind of insinuation.", "I think I threw up a little in my mouth when that implication came up as soon as it did in OPs post. Forget that MIL had to be so vile that even Springer would go pale at the idea of having her on set. \n\nOP needs to make sure she gets maximum shunning from every last person in the family until she not only apologizes for the filth that left her mouth, but admits explicitly that she is wrong and off base. Anything less should leave her in as much of an exile from both sides of the family as possible. \n\nI fear that her wildly successful insane belief is coming from an even more vile place than OP or anyone else may suspect if her first place to reach is that OP was sleeping with her brother", "I dont think that MIL insinuated it. She full out said it. Due to how stupid and shitty it is, OP is being nice to MIl and downgrading it by insinuating that l.", "Nope, don't even drag it out. This woman thought she could call OP a \"Brother F***er\" numerous times and finally get OP to break down and admit it. That is a total insult to OP's brother and his memory. Leave her to stew in her fowl.", "Not even Columbo would leap to those conclusions.", "Just what I was thinking, I don't know why the husband has let this go on so long, either. When I was born my father's mother saw me and was adamant my mom had slept with someone else, because I didn't look enough like my father. She wouldn't let it go. The insinuation was enough to make my parents go NC with her, and I didn't meet her until I was 14. And OP's situation is much worse... that's such a nasty accusation to throw at someone.", "And I thought my fil was dumb for thinking his cat got impregnated by 2 males at the same time because 2 are orange and 2 are grey. Now I have the perfect father's day present, thanks to you.", "People can\u2019t control how others act. The OP said the MIL had said things before but that she hadn\u2019t said anything in awhile, so they probably figured it was done. And mothers can be stubborn as hell, no matter how many times you try to tell them to stop something.", "Yeah, my brother got this once. Showed someone a pic of my son and they said, \"Are you sure he isn't yours?\" Seriously?! He was so grossed out, but imagine being this stupid. Also, I look like the girl version of my brother, so of course my son could look like the boy version of me (aka, my brother!)", "Yeah honestly I was waiting for the \"oh my god he's so-and-so born again!\" not \"oh my god you fucked your brother!\"", "Why is that effort on them to move away and not for the mother in law to fuck off after that accusation?", "OP is the asshole because they told their mother in law that no, they didn't sleep with their brother before he died? They're the asshole for shutting down their mother in law for saying OP and her husband's son is the product of incest? Are you absolutely delusional?", "How is it meaningless? And how does it make the person who accused OP of incest not an AH?", "OP needs to?? How about her husband, the father of her child? It\u2019s his mother who is being vile. Close family members can look alike and I imagine some allergies may be genetic. Most of my extended family is allergic to sulfa but no inbreeding has happened.  My son is 6\u20195\u201d with black hair and hazel eyes and is built like a lineman (American football). His father is 5\u201910\u201d with nondescript hair and blue eyes. But there\u2019s no way that anyone else is his father! There are so many different genes that determine who we are. People need to not judge because obviously false accusations are extremely hurtful and could destroy a relationship. OP, please tell your husband that his mother needs to stfu or she will lose access to her grandson. I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this. You are NTA completely.", "What the heck!??? NTA and your MIL is all the things you called her.", "Yeah women should all clean up family messes ourselves /s", "OMG imagine what this was like for your son. He probably doesn\u2019t even want to think about his own parents having sex to conceive him, but now, thanks to psycho-MILer he has to also think about his mom having sex with her own brother (shudder). That probably needed a lot of showers to wash off the grossness. NTA and you did the right thing getting your kid out of the toxicity asap.", "Tell her you'll get a paternity test, and if it comes back that the father is your husband (and it will!) You will go no contact with her forever.\n\nSee how \"sure\" she is that he's not your husband's and if she wants to play stupid games.", "Your MIL needs to stop taking the movie *A Simple Favor* so literally.", "I agree. Doing a test could be traumatic for the kid too.", "Resemblances even skip generations!\n\nThe resemblance between my niece and I is uncanny. My grandmother even has our preschool pictures positioned side-by-side on her mantle and it's still spooky, lol.", "My sister\u2019s daughter/niece looks so much like me when I was her age. I\u2019ve sent her old photos of me to show her, and she can\u2019t believe it.", "More like 50% :)", "My sister and I married brothers. We do not look anything alike. Different hair texture and color, different eye color and shape and just overall face shape and feature differences. My ex and his brother look nothing alike, 6'3 vs 5'7, hair dark thick curly vs lighter straight and balding.  My sister and her ex have 3 boys. The oldest looks so much like her that I was ablle to convincingly recreate her senior pics with him. The middle looks very much like his dad. The youngest looks completely unlike either of them. He looks like me and my ex. \n\nMy daughter (with my current husband, no intervention) is a carbon copy of me. She and my youngest nephew look far more like siblings than he does to his brothers. Genetics are weird. \n\nThere were a lot of jokes around when my sister was pregnant and her youngest was born. I was bloated from ivf drugs and my sister was losing weight from HG. It was *hilarious* to some people to \"joke\" that ivf had worked but for whatever sick reason they concocted I'd given the baby to my sister and her husband,  Absolutely. Fucking. *HILARIOUS.\"*", "To be fair, a litter of kittens can have multiple fathers among them because of superfecundation. It\u2019s not always the case since the average non-pedigreed cat is already a mixed bag of genetics and crossing two of them can give you a lot of different color kittens, but it is definitely possible within the right window of time.", "I am one of four. One of us has blue eyes, one has green hazel, and the other two are brown. My parents are blue and green hazel. Genetics are weird.", "You are definitely NTA here! Your MIL is absolutely disgusting to even suggest that, especially in front of your son.", "Ok got it! And, yes you handled the situation a lot better than most people (myself included) would have.", "Just to get away from the drama I guess. My mother's relative always had issue on us and to protect our peace we just moved away and it really helped us. \nIt's just a suggestion based on experience.", "I could say the same about my older son and my sister.  They don't look alike but they have very similar personalities plus both have ADHD, which neither my husband nor I have.", "My sister complained that she didn\u2019t just give birth to one like me, looks, original personality, behaviour. She was like one of me is enough.\n\nBut this makes me feel I can go by them and claim said child as mine. So exciting!", "Then someone has some  'splaining to do to your vagina.", "How strange my kid looks nothing like me but Shares features with the mailman hmm", "Your husband likely cheated on you with your sister. Insist on a maternity test and contact a divorce lawyer. Either he cheated and you need a divorce, or you are the real mother but your marriage is broken because you asked for the maternity test. \nSorry to hear that.", "My father in law is 5'5\". My husband is 6'4\". Genetics are ridiculous.", "My husband has brown-black hair and brown eyes. I have light blonde hair and green eyes. Both of our daughters have dark red hair and blue eyes. Genetics really are wild.", "I too, am *glad* she went off on MIL. She's teaching her kids to stand up for themselves no matter who comes at them in such a disrespectful way.\n\nHey OP, don't just demand an apology! \n\nTell her you'll talk to her on the condition she starts your meeting spending five minutes with a bar of soap in her filthy mouth. \n\nIf anyone has earned it, she has!\n\nWhat a degrading and vile thing to say. Seriously.... There's no coming back from that.", "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.\nAgreed. And OP, I think you and your husband need to have a sit down with your son and reaffirm the truth. Root out any evil thoughts that your MIL planted in his mind. \n\nGosh what a wicked MIL.", "This. Some kids, especially teenage boys, seem fine because they aren't talking about it. It's not always the case though.", "Nah fuck that. She doesn't need to do anything but forbid MIL from ever seeing her or her kids ever again. That's a fucked up line to cross. I'd certainly never forgive such a disgusting insinuation.", "Oh yeah, my daughter looks more like my sil than me.", "I'm the carbon copy of my maternal grandmother. I look nothing like my parents.\n\nEdit. Meant paternal and autocorrect made me look dumb.", "My sister looks exactly like our dad's mom, who died when she was a baby. She has different coloring, but her face is like a copy-paste of our grandmother's. Whenever anyone sees a photo of our grandmother in her 20s they comment on it.  People also say that we all look like our dad--but then at the same time, as a kid, my other sister looked \\*so much\\* like my mom's grandma that people thought a childhood photo of her was my sister in dress-up clothes.", "I am apparently an almost perfect copy of my paternal grandmother, while looking almost nothing like my parents or siblings", "Omg, my youngest looks like my grandpa, whose been dead considerably longer than my sons been alive. It was his ghost!! \nNta.", "I have brown hair and green eyes, my husband has brown eyes and hair. My daughter has red hair and blue eyes and no one in our families have had red hair for at least 4 generations. We're all just ginged sleeper cells waiting to drop red headed kids. Genetics is wild.", "NTA. She was acting rudely.", "Same, but paternal grandma!", "An acquaintance of mine was going through a divorce and she didn't know she was pregnant until 6 weeks before she gave birth. She was on the chunky side but not hugely overweight, and she kept having her period. Stress can do weird things.", "My son is a clone of his father and has been from the moment he was born. Same Cow Lick, same feet, same crooked teeth, same natural curly dark hair & eyes. Same dimples.\n\nOMGOSH!!! Maybe he\u2019s both the Mother & the Father!", "I meant paternal too! Need to proofread better ahaha. Apparently our personalities are pretty similar too."]}
