I absolutely adore them and love being their nanny but it\u2019s not always the easiest job. Last week I took them to the library for toddler singalong/playtime, while I was there the mother texted to ask me if there was any chance I could swing by Wegmans to pick up a couple of items for dinner that their delivery order had missed. This is typically not a common task for me, as it tends to be a hassle bringing 3 toddlers into a grocery store, (usually they get groceries delivered, curbside pickup, or I\u2019ll stay home with the trips while a parent ships) but I definitely don\u2019t mind every now and then.\n\n  \nThe parking lot was somewhat full when I got there but there were two empty spots next to the handicapped spots that said \u201creserved for expectant mothers or parents of young children.\u201d There were two spots open and there weren\u2019t many spots in a similar close vicinity to the entrance, so I parked in one figuring that it was okay since I had 3 toddlers with me. Moments after I parked, a woman pulled into the remaining reserved spot (she had an infant).\n\n  \nAs I was just finished getting the triplets out, a woman with three kids (I would guess ages 5, 7, and 10?) was walking past and stopped to asked if the babies were triplets (EXTREMELY common question I get asked while in public with them) and commented on how cute they are. She then said that I don\u2019t look like I\u2019ve carried triplets and I don\u2019t even look old enough to be a mom. Can\u2019t say I was surprised here because I do regularly receive weird/invasive comments in public from people who assume I\u2019m their mom. I just did my typical \u201cHaha I\u2019m just the nanny!\u201d and brushed it off as I always do. \n\n  \nThe mom started freaking out at me and said as the babysitter I shouldn\u2019t be parked in a spot \u201cspecifically for PARENTS\u201d and that since I\u2019m being paid, I should deal with parking further back. She told me she, as a mom, could\u2019ve parked there but wasn\u2019t able to because I took the spot, and that I should move so actual parents could park there. \n\n  \nI said \u201cI parked here because I have 3 toddlers in my care\u201d and started walking into the store with the triplets. She followed us in, loudly ranting at me, before going her separate way once we were fully inside.\n\n  \nThe parents I nanny for said I was fine and that I should of course take those spots if available when I\u2019m out with the triplets. But when I told most of my friends they said that while the woman should\u2019ve minded her own business, she *was* right that I was being paid so I should\u2019ve dealt with farther parking, and I was wrong for taking a spot meant for actual parents.

Why only actual parents? If you have children with you then you qualify for the space? \n\nRight?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThose spots are there to help you get the children out of the car and into the shop easier and without having to get them across the car park, for their safety. It has nothing to do with  making it easier because parents don't get paid.", "NTA. It may say PARENTS  but what it means is ANYONE with small children. With older kids, that woman didn't need the spot as much as you did. Her kids are old enough to walk a distance, the triplets aren't.", "NTA. The spot is for people with young children. Being their biological parent or not shouldn\u2019t negate that fact.", "NTA. If it gives any street cred, I'm a homemaker with a 4-year-old and a 2-year-old and I'm 38weeks pregnant.  I say you can park there.", "Those spots are to accommodate the difficulty of dealing with a stroller/carrier and groceries.  They aren't specifically for lazy idiots to just not want to walk as far.  This woman is hopeless.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA.  Those spaces are to give extra room for you to open doors wide when getting tiny humans out of the car/clip them in and out of car seats; the \"parent/guardian\" status is irrelevant.\n\nThat woman is TA, 100% out of line.  Your being paid doesn't mean you need any less space to get those 3 kids out.  She obviously is prejudiced against nannies or people paid to serve.  May she be infested with the fleas of 1000 camels \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA - those spots are there to make things either for people with children. Would people have an issue if it was a grandparent parking there with their grandkids?", "NTA. You had 3 tiny humans. It can be hard enough to wrangle one across a parking lot - I can't imagine 3! Good on you! That woman needs to mind her own business and stop worrying about what other people are doing. As for her taking the spot, her children aren't 'young' as I'm sure the sign means under 5 or so. You need to learn not to interact with people like that, nothing good can come of it.", "NTA. The point of the spot is for people WITH children or pregnant. Wrangling 3 toddlers into a store warrants a medal as well as a parking spot closer to the store", "NTA. I don't think it's meant to be taken as you literally had to give birth or adopt the little ones you are with to use the parking spot. The purpose of the spot is to make it easier to shop with little kids, so it would extend to other caretakers as well.", "NTA the spots are there so adults caring for small children aren\u2019t walking through a busy parking lot. It\u2019s for the safety of the little humans and having 3 toddlers is absolutely a reason I\u2019d park as close as possible to protect them.", "NTA. Just because you're being paid doesn't make it any less of a hassle. A lot of women are put on paid maternity leave while they're pregnant/new mothers and I'm sure they expect to be able to park there too.", "NTA. The signs should say caregiver, or just anyone with young kids in the car. That woman is a major asshole for several reasons ... she should not have commented on your body and basically she needs to mind her own business.", "You're serving as a caretaker of those three children.  That spot is a practical amenity for customers with kids, not an award for childbearing.  I dub thee NTA, sorry you as a nanny had to deal with a ninny.", "NTA. She can kick rocks.", "NTA, You had 3 18-month-old kids, park in the spot. It is designed for people with infants and toddlers. Normal people know how hard it is to shop with little kids. The sign should say people with little kids not parents.", "NTA\n\nThe intention of those spots are is make the experience easier for someone with children. There is no one checking birth certificates to see if you are actually their parent. Either way, in the absence of their parents, you are in loco parentis, meaning responsible for the children. You're fine. The lady is having a bad day and is very wrongly taking it out on you.", "NTA The parking spot isn't for parents. It's for the person with small children. That might be a parent, it might not. She was already being rude af for making comments about your body.", "NTA. I raised three kids each two years apart in age. As a mother I think you are just who is supposed to park there!", "The point of the space has nothing to do with parentage, ffs. It\u2019s not an award for people who gave birth. \n\nNTA", "What does getting paid or not have to do with wrangling young children in a parking lot? What if it's grandparents, is it acceptable until there's a barter where Grandma watches the kids and dad fixes her porch, and then she's getting paid in kind and doesn't qualify for the spot anymore? \n\nNTA. What a ludicrous argument she was trying to make.", "NTA 100%.... there is \"letter of the law\" and there is \"spirit of the law\"....Spirit or intent of the law should always trump the letter.\n\nThe point of having such spots is to help moms, dads, or whoever wrangle kids near the store where its safer for the kids and easier for the caretaker, vs being in a parking spot much further away, far more taxing to handle, and  exposing small children to the risk of dars constantly backing out of spots.", "NTA. Can I just mention the fact that it would also be dangerous to park further away? I basically raised my sister from Infancy to about toddlerhood. It is not an easy job by any means. If I had the option to park closer to the store to make sure the kid in my care didn\u2019t have as much of a chance of wandering off, I would have. Parent or not.", "NTA, that woman is a lunatic. Not to mention there is absolutely zero legal base for those spots; they\u2019re not like handicapped spots. I could legally park my childfree ass in one of those spots and strut in there with my head held high. It would make me an asshole, but there\u2019s not really anything anyone could do about it.", "NTA, those spaces are there so toddlers aren\u2019t running across car parks. Parent or not, purpose was met. Would she have yelled at a grandparent? Doubt it. Also, her kids don\u2019t really qualify as \u2018young children\u2019 (I\u2019ve also seen this as \u2018infants\u2019) at 5, 7 and 10 they should be able to walk escorted across a car park, not the same as three toddlers.", "NTA, you're a nanny with three Triplets who are only 18 months old, you're juggling three toddlers who need constant care and supervision to make sure they don't run out into the parking lot where there are cars. You may not be their parent, but the spot is there for people with little kids to make stuff safer and easier. \n\nShe's a mom with kids, but they are 5, 7 and 10. Old enough to follow mom inside with no issue, she sounds entitled.", "NTA Of course you can park there if you have three toddlers in your care. I truly don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re friends and that lady would think that it mattered that you were being paid. That doesn\u2019t make it easier to deal with young kids in a grocery store.", "NTA. The spot may be called \"parents of young children\" but the point of having a specific spot isn't to walk less. It's the extra space for unloading strollers, of which you had. Stepparents, foster parents, guardians, ect are all entitled to that spot, it's not just for people who gave birth.", "NTA \n\nNext time, \u201csorry I\u2019m in a rush and can\u2019t talk\u201d", "NTA, one of the reasons that those spots exist is so that there's fewer chances of a small child running in front of a car in a parking lot, not just to create less of an inconvenience. It's a courtesy the business is providing to help you be able to safely maneuver their space. This is the type of situation they exist for.", "NTA - I\u2019m sure the use of the word \u201cparent\u201d there is just short hand for anyone acting as a guardian of children. You had the kids with you, therefor you qualify. This lady is just nuts.", "NTA. Those spots are reserved for people with infants and toddlers in tow (could be parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles or Nannies)  - I\u2019d probably be mad(der) if a parent parked there without their kid(s) but that\u2019s not the case here, you are a champ of running an errand with triplets.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA.  That woman is. So you don't look like you've given birth to triplets? You could have adopted them.  They could be your wards. They could be your step kids. They could be your HOUSEPLANTS,  for all it's her business. You had three little kids in your charge. Doesn't matter how they came to be there.  You're who that spot was designed for.", "NTA, caregivers would have been a way more appropriate term to use. Wrangling 3 18 month olds entitles you to the spot", "NTA in fact you had more of a right to park there than she did! The point of the \u201cparents of young children\u201d parking spots is because it\u2019s notoriously difficult to get babies and toddlers in and out of stores/the car. 5, 7 and 10 are not young kids (in terms of what the close parking is for)", "Absolutely F'ing NTA. 5, 7, 10 aren't young children. I would be far more upset to see her parked in that spot. You are caring for 3 toddlers, you absolutely take precedent. \n\nYou were absolutely within your rights to park there.", "Would she get upset if it was grandma or grandpa with the triplets? Let her be angry. Her kids can walk", "NTA, the important thing for those spaces is that you're getting small children in and out of the car. Not your relationship with them.", "NTA\n\nWhat about guardians? Grandparents, aunts, uncles, foster homes? \n\nYou did good. I\u2019ve been a nanny and I\u2019m a mom now, and I would have done the same as you", "NTA - it's obviously a convenience spot for people with young children. She's delusional.", "NTA but the other asshole here is your boss, who thinks that you should go to a supermarket with three toddlers.", "NTA. It makes total sense that this happened in a Wegmans parking lot\u2026at least if your Wegmans is anything like mine is. \n\nI would have doubled down and been extra petty when she started in with the invasive comments about your age and body. Something along the lines of \u201cI still get carded and no one ever believes I\u2019m 43.  So blessed to have such amazing genetics.\u201d", "NTA.  The point is minimal fuss and distance with small kids, not\u2026congrats on having sex, you get a shorter walk.  Wtf.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re caring for three young children and needed that spot to get them safely in and out of the car. That\u2019s what the spot is for - it\u2019s not a \u2018reward\u2019 for the actual parents.\n\nYour response was perfect. Don\u2019t give this a second thought.", "The woman who said that too you is an idiot. Simple as that. Continue to park in parent spots with the triplets. NTA", "NTA. You used the spots just as they were designed.", "NTA, I\u2019m a parent if you got 18 month old triplets I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the mom, grandma, aunt, or nanny, park in the damn spot it\u2019s what it\u2019s there for.", "Nta its a spot that is close bc kids are a hassel. Not for those who are biologically related.", "NTA. F*** her.", "NTA as a mother of three I say you have as much right to park there as I do. The whole point is that it\u2019s difficult and unsafe to get young children across the parking lot. \n\nBy her logic are grandparents allowed to park there?  Aunts and uncles? Older siblings?", "WTH?! Those spots aren't just for convenience but for safety. Trying to wrangle three very young and short children through a busy parking lot is a recipe of disaster. Your kids are much younger than hers, you are actually much more entitled to park there. I wouldn't use those spots with a child older than 5.", "I remember an elderly person parking in the new mother's parking spot. I had planned on parking there (I was pregnant) but I guessed the lady needed it more than I did. I didn't confront her about it for that reason.", "NTA. Its a spot for folks with young kids. U had 3 with u. It was meant for situations like yours.", "Sorry, but why is there special parking for pregnant women and women with kids. They can walk like everyone else. There is no special parkingforr seniors and they need it far more than the others. Those who  have kids or who are pregnant are younger and capable of walking farther.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
