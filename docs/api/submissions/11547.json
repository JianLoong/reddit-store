I long for the day I can call a rich greedy landlord and say \u201cgarage door won\u2019t open, fix it.\u201d Or \u201chey, there\u2019s water in the basement, you might wanna get someone in to look at that.\u201d\n\nEdit: even if I paid double my current mortgage and property taxes in rent, it would still be a cost savings compared to what I\u2019ve paid in terms of: mortgage, property taxes, and home repairs over the 5 years.", "lmao 401ks are not just for rich people. what an incredibly ignorant thing to say", "So you think people should 1) not earn money on their savings 2) work until they die?\n\nIf you are poor it's even more important to learn how to invest.", "Your Aunt gifted you 12k and you have the nerve to complain? I think I found the real reason she gave you the boot.", "They're taking all the financial risk though. I'd charge for that for sure", "I probably won\u2019t take the risk but for those that do allow others to live in their homes, I think raising the rent every year when property taxes are raised for the homeowner is reasonable. Buying a house is always a wise investment, I\u2019m just wanting to sell ours to make the profit from what we\u2019ve paid into it.", "People will always need to rent, or want to rent. It shouldn't benefit those who can afford to buy up all the properties and profit from it. Those properties should go to social housing so everyone has a roof over their head without constant threat of eviction through no fault of their own.", "Yeah but equally \"but everyone else is doing it\" is kind of a bad excuse.", "Just don't invest in the roof over people's heads. Get a job. Pay into a pension. Don't sit on your ass taking money every month from real people who can't afford a home.", ">If you are poor it's even more important to learn how to invest.\n\nTruly spoken like somebody who's never had to choose between heating and food.", "They lived in an uninhabitable apartment if she can't rent the damn thing out to non family!", "lol, my auntie gave me a family discount that came with MANY exceptions that involved being a part of the family, and it is one I regret both for our relationship and the bleak results of mixing 'business with family.' If I had know what I do now, the 12k was not worth the toxicity that it created.   \n\n\nRest assured, i'll be most definitely paying back that money if ever hear her complain again about how no one appreciated her and her abusive behavior.", "I\u2019m fortunate enough to be able to afford luxury rent prices. Why should I take away a government sponsored home from home some one who actually needs it? \n\nUnless the social housing is going to offer tiers of accommodations, then I\u2019d rather rent from a landlord who will provide me with luxury accommodations. Somehow I don\u2019t see the government proving places with doormen, heated unground parking, and on-site fitness facilities. \n\nThere should be significantly more subsidized housing available, without a doubt and in the past I\u2019ve worked with organizations that are trying to achieve that. But the answer isn\u2019t for folks as fortunate as I am to use socially supported accommodations.", "You don't seem to understand that pensions invest in real estate. \n\nSo you really think ppl who can barely afford rent could afford to buy? So the options are: buy or be homeless?", "Or, that's how over time you or your children get out of poverty. \n\nInvesting is simply a form of saving - do you think only the rich should have savings?", "Everyone should be able to use socially supported accommodations. That way there's a mix of socio-economic situations in every community, instead of sink estates or luxury areas.", "Buy or have social housing.", "Savings are great but your being naive assuming everyone has the discretionary spending to be able to afford to.", "If you're assuming people are being paid enough to put money away, you're *very* out of touch with the realities of being poor", "Hoarding housing, a thing people need to live, isn't a service.\n\nAnd yes, OP owning three houses when most people own zero houses qualifies as hoarding.", "Tell you what - How about the sister buys her own house and it's all good?\n\nNo? She can't afford to buy? \n\nIf she can't afford a *heavily discounted rent*, there is no way she can afford housing in that area. \n\nThe sister needs to move to a place she can afford or buy if she can. The brother is absolutely providing a service. Who do you think fixes the house his sister lives in? Deals with taxes? Deals with broken appliances? \n\nThe brother is taking on *massive liability* and not making ends meet. The sister is a damn mooch and living beyond her means."]}
