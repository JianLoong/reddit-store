And they don\u2019t likely appreciate any of your generosity as they view the situation as you\u2019re better off so you\u2019re obligated to help us.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say who is the AH without knowing what his sister pays now vs new price as well as what he can rent it out to strangers. And what alternatives his sister may have - friends, family (not you, duh), or a studio?\n\nAsking for $100 more - reasonable. $1000 more - unreasonable. Same with stranger renter.\n\nInquiring minds want to know!?", "I agree but this is her sibling, and she is trying to go the extra mile. She is not obligated to, but since she's trying to be nice, that's where negotiations come in", "I agree with you If it was his only source of income then him being worried is justified, but evicting your sister just so you can't have extra income is somewhat bad :D", "you are literally the comic  \n\"we should improve society somewhat\"  \n\"Oh, but you LIVE in a society... I am very intelligent\"", "I\u2019m confused. She as in sister or OP? \n\nThe sister is unwilling to negotiate. I don\u2019t get how she doesn\u2019t understand rent goes up every so often. Her rent wasn\u2019t increased for three years so she should have been prepared for an increase eventually. Rents rarely go down, unless of course someone gives you below market rate.", "in my area landlords only need to notify of their intent to non renew within a specific time frame. i've never heard of it like your area because how else would evictions work.", "Then if it\u2019s not affordable to a renter, the renter should buy a house. Ya know, since landlords are the devil, or whatever the bs whining is. This works both ways. Don\u2019t like the situation, make a different decision on how to live.", "Many would rather complain and push out hatred toward landlords than understand what it costs to own a home, which you did ask. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re willing to learn. I grew up poor an in low income housing so had no clue until I was in my twenties. One thing I learned as a bookkeeper for a property management company is insurance companies often require certain conditions before they\u2019ll cover you. Sometimes it\u2019s additional security features, others it\u2019s replacing high cost items more often like water heaters, roof, HVAC systems, etc. that, and renters insurance on a home can cost more than general homeowners.", "They do not need to justify the cost so long as they fall within guidelines. If you\u2019re month-to-month it means the tenant OR landlord can cancel with a months notice. Not just the tenant. It also means the landlord can raise rent within local landlord/tenant laws.", "Thank you for explaining the insurance part. I understood homeowners insurance as something you could get, and the cost based on the current state of your home, as well as your personal property that had value, kinda like car insurance, your covering an \"as is,\" rather than wanting a specific state of livability before insurance can be received. And hadn't even thought there was a renters insurance, I thought it was still a general insurance thing, but that does make sense to have two completely different types.", "Your view isn\u2019t realistic though. No one would work in those industries if they don\u2019t get any profit, money to pay their workers, etc. Look at farmers. They work in a very tough industry with very long demanding hours. I work with horses. The stable I work and live at is on a dairy farm. Those guys work so hard, harder than many people in office jobs do. I know a farmer who is 87 years old and is still working on the farm. If you think they don\u2019t deserve to make a profit so they can supply food, housing and luxuries for their own families, then you are 100% wrong. \n\nI 100% agree that everyone should have access to food, housing and medicine, but this should be at the cost from the government, not from the general public who are also just trying to make a living.", "In my city plenty of regular homeowners not even LL have seen their taxes, utility costs double. \n\nSo some LL definitely are seeing their costs go up by a significant amount. \n\nI'm sure some LL are just trying to make more money but some are also likely just trying to survive.", "But you've already admitted that you think landlords are meanies. So it isn't going to matter what OPs expenses are."]}
