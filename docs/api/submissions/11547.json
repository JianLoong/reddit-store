OP has a lot of holes in this story, and I'm inclined to think that if he could fill them in favorably, he would - why would any OP leave out truthful information that makes them look good?", "My taxes just went up. I live in a state with very high property tax. If I was renting out a property and the property taxes went up $1k-$2k, I would want to tack that onto the rent.", "Excuse me for having empathy for people", "But it\u2019s not just the mortgage. It\u2019s insurance, property taxes, assessments, you don\u2019t actually know what his business costs are and how they might be changing.", "If it's so terrible, then sell those properties? Like, there's a very easy solution to your problem.", "Look at Vienna:\n\nMore than 60 percent of the city\u2019s 1.8 million inhabitants live in subsidized housing and nearly half of the housing market is made up of city-owned flats or cooperative apartments. \n\nhttps://www.politico.eu/article/vienna-social-housing-architecture-austria-stigma/amp/", "As long as they are not landlords.", "Which increases yes. But not at the rates landlords would have you believe. They\u2019re making a killing", "imagine putting \"fair rent\" together without a negative and not wearing clown makeup.", "Lol you think i know what an nft pic would look like?\n\nI've saved way too much to gamble it, thanks.", "Yeah I'm not saying everyone can I'm saying it's absurd to discount real estate as a vehicle for investment among ordinary ppl.", "I agree that everyone should learn financial literacy, it's valuable.\n\nAnd those who have good financial literacy, usually invest and diversify their savings without even being beyond poverty level.\n\nWhile also for many, there is no spare income to save for an emergency, never mind income they can afford to invest and not have access to.\n\nWhen so many people can't afford a $500 emergency, they are definitely not thinking about investing or real-estate. \n\nSome of these commenters are expressing just that. Maybe if they weren't so overworked and hungry. \n\nBut yes, investments are not for rich people, I know many with lower class incomes making sure their money is getting them farther.\nEspecially since inflation is devaluing our savings, more than ever, when one had spare money, they need to find safe places to build its value. At this point, even maintaining value.\n\nBut when my bank calls me and ask if I'd like to review ways to invest my money, I laugh and say, I don't have any spare money and that's not changing any day soon.\n\nI wish I had learned any amount of financial literacy before my 30s. Coming from a low income family, most of my family had no idea how to build wealth, didn't understand many basic things. Crucial things that should be taught through school so people understand money, inflation, taxes and investing.\n\nMaybe then they would be more likely to save it away and invest when able versus gambling it away and wishing on a miracle.\n\nI hope some day I can save money to invest it. Just not my reality today and inflation is affecting the lower class significantly more.\nWe need to know about these things and understand what's happening around us, even if we cannot act on it.", "That's the point i was trying to make.\n\nInvesting isn't only for the rich even if the poor can't much of the time. \n\nRather, they are those who could most benefit from learning how to make the most of their money and have it do the most for them. \n\nMany do save for important things, that doesn't mean long term savings, but for important costs. Well, better to earn more on those savings - or pay off high interest credit cards - and so on. \n\nMany landlords - their rent is their pension or their retirement fund in full.", ">Sure, he complains about \"rising costs\", but he's given no specifics about what his sister is actually paying or what those costs are.\n\nWe know that it is below market because he is giving a familial discount. \n\nWe *all* know about rising prices on everything and since he has *unlimited liability* for the house, he would be a fool to not price that into rent. \n\n>The sister is, per OP's own admission, paying rent. Heavily discounted or otherwise, she's contributing what she can afford.\n\nLet's say you had a friend. \n\nThis friend comes out and eats with you. \n\nYou, trying to be nice, pay for part of his meal (that's the discount).\n\nThe friend pays what they can and this *was* the agreement. \n\nThe prices on the menu go up. \n\nYou *want* your friend to keep coming out with you, but can't afford to provide *an even larger discount*. Or, maybe you just don't want to.\n\nYour friend refuses to contribute more or discuss how they could. \n\nDo you keep paying for that friend to eat with you, or do you tell them to eat somewhere less expensive?\n\nIf what she can contribute isn't enough, she has no right to stay there. Her *brother* has no obligation to pay for *her* housing. \n\n>I hope that the social services you no doubt despise are there for you in your old age.\n\nHer brother is not a social safety net program."]}
