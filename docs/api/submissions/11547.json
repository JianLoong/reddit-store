Give her a recommendation as the Landlord, consider helping her with the deposit. \n\nBut, don't use the word \"evict\". Eviction is done through the courts after breaking the lease, if she is saying she can't afford a higher rent, that is not grounds for eviction, not paying rent is grounda for eviction.\n\nAlso, double check the terms in the lease you have with her.", "How much are you trying to raise it?

Are you making sure you\u2019re following the regulations? Or just arbitrarily increasing?\n\nThe only way I could see you being NTA is if you are following regulations (allowable increase, correct amount of written notice given etc), and you let her find another place before actually evicting her.

I would figure out how much you need to increase the rent to make ends meet, and then tell her simply but openly how much you need to increase the rent to cover costs. She will then have to make a decision about whether to pay it or move.", "NTA. You rely on the money to pay bills. Give her a rent increase notice like any other landlord would and let her decide what to do about it. She can budget differently or find a new place within her budget.", "INFO: What are the terms of your contract? Does it specify when you can raise the rent? Your contact is your first and foremost obligation. If the contract doesn't allow for rent hikes then you are most certainly the AH.", "NAH\n\nYou are allowed to charge a fair market rental rate.  She can decide whether she can afford it or not.\n\nMake sure you are following the proper legal procedures for landlords where you live (some may limit how much you can increase the rent, and there will likely be notice period requirements etc.).\n\nI\u2019d just tell her what you want to raise the rent to.  If she continues to say she can\u2019t afford it, then let her know how much time she has to find a new place that is more affordable.

And, like everyone else, those expenses are rising.\n\nWhat I would do is find the minimum amount you need to raise your rent to cover your expenses.  Maybe add an extra 10% to the costs to cover eventualities that might happen with any property.  Then make that the rent she must pay going forward.\n\nIf your sister still \"can't afford it\" evict her.  Like others have suggested, you can help her find a new place to stay.  But I wouldn't rent to family ever again, to avoid these conflicts.\n\nYou shouldn't put yourself into ever increasing financial stress so your sister can keep a below market rate rent.   And your sister is absolutely an AH for refusing to try to work with you so you won't need to evict her.", "NTA, you\u2019re doing what you need to to stay afloat.

Shouldn't have gotten her involved with business.", "I guess it depends on how much you need to raise the rent. I mean you don't want to use your rental properties as your sole source of income I hope you actually have a real job as well. But let's say you only need to raise it like 150 bucks what I would do is say hey look as of June 1st it's going up $75 then January 1st it's going up the other $75 that way you're still raising it but you're giving her time to be able to work it into her budget and figure out another budget. You don't want to evict your sister I promise you're going to have nothing but problems for the rest of your life with family I mean if that's something you can live with then do you whatever but most people don't want to be put in that situation.

If so, what grounds are you doing so?  She\u2019s paying rent and so you cannot evict her for non payment. What does your lease with her say?", "NTA. She isn't willing to work with you to even give you a baseline of what she can afford. You can't be expected to give and give and give when she won't meet you halfway. Does she expect you to give up on asking so she gets her way?", "Landlords gonna landlord. Because it's your sister you feel bad about it, but millions of people are going through evictions because those who can snap up all the properties. Now they've got rising costs and passing it on to people who simply can't afford it.\n\nDo what you've got to do, but YTA for being a landlord.", "NTA. Not fair of her to put you out of money that she should already be paying. If she\u2019s not willing to compromise on the rise in cost, then she needs to leave. I rent from my grandparents and thankfully they haven\u2019t raised the price at all. They own another complex and he\u2019s only raised it by $20 a year if that since it\u2019s in a separate town.", "If you have a signed contract on the amount you can't just increase the rent. You can increase it when the lease is up, but doing so prior would make this a YTA verdict (and it's probably not even legal to do so).", "YTA. \n\nYou own two properties that you rent out, and I assume one you live in, and you\u2019re considering evicting YOUR SISTER to make more money. Jeeeez. People\u2019s homes should not be an opportunity for others to make money.  Landlords are the worst.", "Yep YTA. People aren't making enough and rent is out of control right now. You want to \"keep up\" at the expense of others having a roof over their head. And it's your sister.", "YTA\n\nYou're collecting passive income for sitting on your ass and doing nothing. Now, you want to put your family on the street so you can squeeze the life out of some other unlucky shmuck. This is why being a landlord is such a scummy business. You fuck with people's lives and only see the numbers behind it.", "Yes, absolutely, you are.\n\nIt is pretty plain and simple: she can't afford paying more. She doesn't  have to sit down with you and talk about all the avocados and toasts she is spending her money on.\n\nEveryone is dealing with inflation.\n\nSure you can evict her like every other landlord is doing to people who are unable to afford rent.  It is perfectly within your right... and much like many of these landlords who are 'making extra money on the side', they are assholes.\nthey don't care if people become homeless. You just get the added spice of knowing that you're evicting your sister. Hope it is worth it. \n\n\nHomeowning should be a necessity, not a business.\n\nAlso legally you shouldn't be allowed to just randomly reneg on an agreed upon price if there is a contract involved. Most renters require advanced warnings, and depending on where you live, having a maximum limit of how much you can raise the rent every year.  So, probably bad luck with your sibling, she should have not taken your offer in the first place.", "It depends on how much your raising it. Being a landlord is NOT like other jobs. You are providing a HOME for a human being who has human rights. That's why there are all sorts of laws trying to prevent landlords from doing what best for them to maximize profit.
