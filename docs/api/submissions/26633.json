What did this \"friend\" expect you to do?", "NTA\n\nYour friend is wrong. Like I say to my husband, \"You can't throw people under a bus they're driving.\"*\n\nGiven what you said about the gf, she doesn't want to be raising an ablest and a bully. That's part of why they immediately went off on him. Sibling (even step) disagreements are frequent. But bullying someone for their medical condition is fucked up. He fucked around, he found out. \n\n*In case it's not clear... if you've caused the problem I can freely assign you responsibility for it because the issue exists because of you (this is usually a work statement, not personal, but it fits here)", "NTA \n\nThis person lives in your home with you and it looks pretty permanent so you shouldn't have to deal with his nastiness on a daily basis, it really takes a toll on your mental health when each day you walk in the door to what should be your safe space you have to bolster yourself for his name calling and insults. The fact that he basically ignores your physical limitations and chooses this way to harass you is cruel. He's a bully. I am happy you did that recording so they both know what is going on.", "NTAYour friend isn't your friend. Your friend thinks he should have just gotten away with it? That's basically the only answer. You're going to get a lot of comments that are angry with this 'friend'. It would be a good idea to show them so they know they should be supportive instead of blaming the victim.", "NTA. Being rude and negatively affecting relationships is one thing but protecting yourself is another", "NTA at all. This is your home too, you deserve to be comfortable in it. No one was to be ridiculed all day at home by anyone. It\u2019s the fact nothing was being done before that he believed he could continue to treat you like garbage. He\u2019s 19 and he has a girlfriend, he should know better. He\u2019s an adult", "NTA but that's just a moral judgement (legally recording consent laws vary widely across different states).", "op=NTA\n\nYou have the right not to be bullied in your home.  He was bullying you.  You offered proof of it.\n\nSad to say, I doubt he'll stop.  The only way he'll stop is if he's made to leave.  And I see no indication in your post that that will happen.", "the only way this makes any kind of sense to me is if your friend has a thing for him. she\u2019s a bad friend regardless, but at least that would explain her motivation. maybe make some different friends. nta.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
