Housing is hellish there and the only place she found was an apartment-share that didn\u2019t allow pets. She asked me, almost begged me to take Parmesan with me until she found something better. She helped me out in the past, so I agreed to take him in for free.\n\nOne thing led to another and I ended up agreeing to take care of him until she graduated (this is a 1 year learning program). Some rules were made, one of them being: I\u2019d pay for the dog food but any grooming or medical bills were for her.\n\nAbout Parmesan: he\u2019s a sweetheart but also an idiot who eats everything he finds (plastic wraps included). He also has some ear problems that require a lot of care.\n\nOne month ago, I got distracted by some chores and forgot to put one of my bags of groceries away. I realized too late that the dog had rummaged through it. He had eaten some bread with the paper wrap, and almost half a bunch of grapes! No need to say, I freaked out! I don\u2019t know if there's any Parisian reading this, but if you recently saw a girl running through the sub with a French Bouledogue in her arms and vomit all over her shirt, that was probably me.Parmesan stayed at the vet for 2 days. I called my friend to tell her what happened, and kept her updated with her dog\u2019s situation. I took a few days from work and worked from home the rest of the week so I could watch over the dog. Thank God, he got better.\n\nAfter he fully recovered, I told my friend about the vet fees (600\u20ac). She asked if I was kidding. I told her no. She started screaming and told me I had some nerve to ask her for money after I almost killed her dog. That when she agreed about covering vet fees, she meant for his ear problems, not for things that were obviously my fault.\n\nLook, I feel horrible for what happened. I know I should have been more careful. But I can\u2019t afford this bill at all. I offered to cover for 25% of it. No answer. I proposed her to pay in installments. No answer. I went once to her apartment. Her roommate told me she wasn\u2019t home and agreed to give her my message. No answer.\n\nAfter a month, I lost it and texted her\u00a0: \u00abKeep ghosting me and I\u2019ll tie your dog in front of your apartment\u2019s door then freaking leave. Pets allowed or not, I don\u2019t care!\u00a0I\u2019m out\u00bb This was an empty threat. I wouldn\u2019t do that to Parmesan. I just wanted her to finally answer her phone. But she still hasn\u2019t nor did she visited her dog since the incident. AITA?\n\nEdit: I felt entitled to ask because I had said yes to a few weeks at first, not a whole year. The first months were basically me asking her every week \u00abSo, found a place?\u00bb and her answering \u00abnot yet\u00bb. Then she just said that it'd be way simpler that way and I agreed because, yeah, I grew a bit attached to him, but also: what else was I supposed to do? This is also the first time I\u2019m asking her anything in 8 months.

Firstly, you fucked up by allowing him to eat poisonous food. However, I gather from your post that you do not have the financial means to cover this kind of cost. Moreover the deal with your friend implied that you would buy the basic daily care stuff while she would cover the larger unanticipated bills. Out of the two of you she is the one that should have budgeted for this situation.

If OP had said no do you really think the friend would have came and got him? It was either OP keeps him or dumps him at a shelter because the friend had zero intentions of taking him back", "The friend is abusing OPs good nature. She should be paying OP to keep the dog and paying for food.\n\nI'm sure OP was guilted into keeping the dog.", "No, the op agreed to take the dog for a few weeks then the owner started not answering their questions about when they were going to get a pet friendly place so the op got stuck with the dog for this long.. The original agreement was for a few weeks and the OP basically got manipulated into keeping the dog for longer.", "It hasn't been a year. Seven months is a long time but it is not a year. And if she couldn't watch the dog that long, she should have told the owner.\n\nAlso, the owner not having trained the dog is something OP knew. It's not like it was a surprise. Dogs don't know cause and effect. People do. If dog is not trained to stay out of shit, keep toxic shit away from where dog can reach it.\n\nOwner isn't great for not picking up their dog months ago or training their dog, but OP was fine doing this all this time until they almost kill the dog based on THEIR negligence. \n\nIf I run over someone's kid because mommy didn't teach him to look both ways, that shit is still my fault.", "Agreed.", "No she shouldn\u2019t, because she chose to make the arrangement to watch the dog under those parameters. It\u2019s not like she agreed to care for the dog for a week and was stuck with it for 6 months.", "Yeah I'm with you here, the owner seems pretty flippant about just leaving their dog for a year with someone; then seemingly not visiting. I'd say they abandoned that sweet Parm with OP", "If your dog is at a kennel and needs medical attention because of negligence that\u2019s absolutely not on the owner.", "This, OP is NTA at all. The owner is for essentially abandoning their dog. OP is doing their friend a HUGE favour by taking in the dog and feeding it. If friend don\u2019t have OP, they\u2019d be footing a hefty bill to keep their dog at the kennel.", "The owner didn\u2019t abandon the dog, she made an agreement for OP to care for the dog for a year. And covering normal medical expenses does NOT include bills occurring due to OP\u2019s gross negligence. The dog could have died. It is 100% OP\u2019s responsibility.", "\"One thing led to another and I ended up agreeing to take care of him for the length of the entire program\"\n\nSecond paragraph. Doesn't matter if OP \"got manipulated\", she still agreed. It was on her to be responsible and have a back bone and say no if she was uncomfortable or incapable.", "> Edit: I felt entitled to ask because I had said yes to a few weeks at first, not a whole year. The first months were basically me asking her every week \u00abSo, found a place?\u00bb and her answering \u00abnot yet\u00bb. Then she just said that it'd be way simpler that way and I agreed because, yeah, I grew a bit attached to him, but also: what else was I supposed to do? This is also the first time I\u2019m asking her anything in 8 months. But maybe you\u2019re right, it was a bit insensitive", "That's kinda exactly what happened apparently lol", "She agreed to a few weeks, and got stuck for  a year.", "Okay and how much did this lady save by getting her friend to watch her dog instead of sending it to a kennel?", "She made an agreement for OP to look after the dog for a few weeks, and then grifted OP into looking after the dog for longer, at OPs cost. OP was conned. Any court in the world would make owner pay the bills, backpay expenses,  and OP would probably also get the choice to keep the dog.\n\nOwner is 100% in the wrong here.", "Friend scammed OP into taking care of the dog for a few weeks that rolled over to near a month. Maybe the friend should use the money they saved on not paying for dog care and spend that on a vet.", "OP wouldn't be in this situation if it wasn't for the friend. The friend chose OP and accepted OP as a person to look after the dog. \n\nOP is to blame here, gross negligence is an exaggeration. I doubt many dog owners know dogs can't have grapes, let alone non dog owners like OP.\n\nThe friend is also to blame, they ultimately took the risk of having someone look after their dog. OP also makes it clear they thought all medical expenses were covered, not \"normal medical expenses\" as you assume. \n\nIf OPs information is accurate, the friend wouldn't win at small claims as they agreed to cover medical expenses. That was on the friend for not clarifying that. \n\nThis was a total accident that could have happened to anyone. For that reason, yes, OPs fault, but also the friend needs to realize the situation and take responsibility for THEIR dog.", "That doesn\u2019t matter. Would your animals be happier for a year in a kennel, or with a loved one? What matters is that the owner and OP made an arrangement that worked for both of them. OP\u2019s negligence could have caused the dog to die. It is 100% their responsibility to cover the medical cost.", "Do people really not see a difference between covering normal medical expenses and medical expenses that OP is entirely at fault for? Seriously??", "I see the difference fully, that doesn't matter though. OP was told medical expenses were covered, there was no condition given on that. A medical bill has come up and they don't want to pay."]}
