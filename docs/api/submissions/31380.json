Housing is hellish there and the only place she found was an apartment-share that didn\u2019t allow pets. She asked me, almost begged me to take Parmesan with me until she found something better. She helped me out in the past, so I agreed to take him in for free.\n\nOne thing led to another and I ended up agreeing to take care of him until she graduated (this is a 1 year learning program). Some rules were made, one of them being: I\u2019d pay for the dog food but any grooming or medical bills were for her.\n\nAbout Parmesan: he\u2019s a sweetheart but also an idiot who eats everything he finds (plastic wraps included). He also has some ear problems that require a lot of care.\n\nOne month ago, I got distracted by some chores and forgot to put one of my bags of groceries away. I realized too late that the dog had rummaged through it. He had eaten some bread with the paper wrap, and almost half a bunch of grapes! No need to say, I freaked out! I don\u2019t know if there's any Parisian reading this, but if you recently saw a girl running through the sub with a French Bouledogue in her arms and vomit all over her shirt, that was probably me.Parmesan stayed at the vet for 2 days. I called my friend to tell her what happened, and kept her updated with her dog\u2019s situation. I took a few days from work and worked from home the rest of the week so I could watch over the dog. Thank God, he got better.\n\nAfter he fully recovered, I told my friend about the vet fees (600\u20ac). She asked if I was kidding. I told her no. She started screaming and told me I had some nerve to ask her for money after I almost killed her dog. That when she agreed about covering vet fees, she meant for his ear problems, not for things that were obviously my fault.\n\nLook, I feel horrible for what happened. I know I should have been more careful. But I can\u2019t afford this bill at all. I offered to cover for 25% of it. No answer. I proposed her to pay in installments. No answer. I went once to her apartment. Her roommate told me she wasn\u2019t home and agreed to give her my message. No answer.\n\nAfter a month, I lost it and texted her\u00a0: \u00abKeep ghosting me and I\u2019ll tie your dog in front of your apartment\u2019s door then freaking leave. Pets allowed or not, I don\u2019t care!\u00a0I\u2019m out\u00bb This was an empty threat. I wouldn\u2019t do that to Parmesan. I just wanted her to finally answer her phone. But she still hasn\u2019t nor did she visited her dog since the incident. AITA?\n\nEdit: I felt entitled to ask because I had said yes to a few weeks at first, not a whole year. The first months were basically me asking her every week \u00abSo, found a place?\u00bb and her answering \u00abnot yet\u00bb. Then she just said that it'd be way simpler that way and I agreed because, yeah, I grew a bit attached to him, but also: what else was I supposed to do? This is also the first time I\u2019m asking her anything in 8 months.

By your own admission you were careless in leaving the groceries within the dog's access because you knew that the dog would try to eat them. Well, it did, and the vet bill is the outcome, along with a dog that's still alive (silver lining?).  Claiming distraction / forgetfulness doesn't absolve you from culpability.

She shouldn't be blatantly ignoring you, especially regarding the health of HER dog, but you should have been more careful about dangerous foods when you were completely aware that this dog will eat anything within his vicinity.

Firstly, you fucked up by allowing him to eat poisonous food. However, I gather from your post that you do not have the financial means to cover this kind of cost. Moreover the deal with your friend implied that you would buy the basic daily care stuff while she would cover the larger unanticipated bills. Out of the two of you she is the one that should have budgeted for this situation. I think you have made financial offers that should have been acceptable to your friend.\n\nI think the last threat you made to chain the dog up outside her appartment is far out of line.
