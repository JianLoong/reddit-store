She calls her something different now cause she didn't like that I copied it but I stuck to it cause if I kept coping her it woulda been obvious.\n\nHowever I also know my cousin on my step-dads side calls his grandma(step-dad's step-mom) mom-mom(ETA when asked he specified it was because she was mom's mom) so I kinda see both as acceptable. While specifying that I have no first-hand experience, I would say by my understanding a kid will repeat words when first learning and may go \"mom! Mom!\" When wanting you and she may take it to mean her and you may want to avoid instances like that.\n\nAlso in my family we had grandma/grandpa as one side of the family and big momma/grandad as the other side(with grandma/grandpa last name for great grandparents) so I get wanting different names for grandparents to be able to talk about them separately and easily. Weirdly when my step-dads parents came into play we all ended up with different names for them. One sister said grandma/grandpa first name, the other says grandma/grandpa bear(the name we originally came up with as kids meeting them), and I just kinda went with their first names cause we call my stepdad by his first name so that seemed fair....did continue the grandma/grandpa last name for great grandparents tho.\n\nMaybe you can find a different grandma nickname while still not one you're uncomfortable with together?", "NTA.  It does seem a little weird.  Growing up one side of my family my great grandparents were Nonnie, Pampaw, and Mammaw and my grandparents were Nana and Pawpaw.  There are plenty of alternatives that aren't \"mom-mom or mum-mum\"", "NTA.  She needs to understand your boundaries.", "Umm, mawmaw, pawpaw, etc has been used on one side of my family for generations, going back to my grandparents using names like that for their grandparents.  It may be a regional thing but grandparents being \"grandma and grandpa\" is NOT a universal thing", "I had a friend who called her grandmother Mom-Mom (in the 80s). This was in Maryland.
