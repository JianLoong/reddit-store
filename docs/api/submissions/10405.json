ESPECIALLY when you have a history of miscarriages", "ESH. \n\n(1) In your wife\u2019s defense, two drinks are not going to make a whole lot of difference in a healthy pregnancy, and especially not at the 5 month point (I\u2019m an MD)\n\n(2) In your defense, it can\u2019t be easy feeling like someone is doing something that might put your baby at risk and feeling like your wife is not being honest with you. \n\nYou handled it so, so wrong though. Correct response: talk about your concerns to your wife and talk to your OB about it. You should not have yelled at her or threatened that CPS would get involved. \n\nMy best guess would be that either your wife did research or one of the other women there reassured her that it was okay. Either way - yelling at and shaming an otherwise conscientious, careful woman was the wrong way to go about it, my friend.\n\nEdit: \nI said ESH because *everyone* sucks here. The wife drank while pregnant and did not talk to her husband about it. AH move. Husband handled it by yelling at her. Also an AH move. \n\nAlso I am in no way condoning alcohol during pregnancy and wouldn\u2019t tell someone that it is okay.  Just pointing out the statistical reality, which is that two drinks over an entire pregnancy won\u2019t make much of a difference (assuming wife is being honest, which I am fully aware she may not be).", "The fact that she got tipsy while pregnant is concerning, does she have a drinking problem? I\u2019ve known some pregnant women who have a small glass of wine later in their pregnancies, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone get tipsy or close to it. I would be concerned.", "After 2 miscarriages, I think you know how precarious it is to lose them. She isn't helping matters by drinking.", "NTA. Yikes. I would\u2019ve yelled too.", "NTA.\n\nOne glass of wine isnt recommended till the third trimester and even then its suggested you avoid it. \n\nI dont think yelling is helpful but you are right to be upset about it.", "Not making a judgement here, but the most recent info has shown that having even a small amount of alcohol at any time during a pregnancy can trigger certain enzymes that can slow or stop a baby's brain development. My wife never drank a drop after she found out she was pregnant with our kids.", "NTA.\n\nShe really need to grow up big time, and quickly.", "NTA. She had a lot of past miscarriages, so it should be common sense to not drink anything that can damage the baby\u2019s development. I know of people who drink while pregnant, and it causes developmental issues in the child.", "NTA. It is just not okay to drink or do drugs or ingest anything that would negatively affect the baby. I mean seriously - she can\u2019t do 9 months without alcohol? After losing several babies already? Why take the chance!!!! Alcohol is poison. It is poison to us adults in quantities that our livers cannot fully process. It is poison to a developing baby even more so. You reacted out of passion for your child. Clearly you care more about the baby than she does.", "NTA there are some situations where yelling is appropriate and this is one. If she was slurring in the video she clearly had more than 2 drinks. Especially with a history of miscarriages it's a huge unnecessary risk & potentially damaging to your child", "I'm going with NTA. when you are trying to convince,  and shes drinking, that's incredibly irresponsible. Sure some babies are ok if mom has a drink or two... others are not. There is no knowing how one baby gets FAS and another does not. Safer to just abstain.", "There is no safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy. Source: CDC. \n\nAnger is justified here.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. While yelling at someone is generally a bad thing, being upset for the health risk to your unborn child makes it understandable. Especially with your previous miscarriages and the resulting emotional trauma. A small amount of alcohol may not be dangerous depending on many factors, but it seems careless for her to risk it. I wish you both the best of luck with your family.", "ESH: I\u2019m not entirely sure that she was slurring her words or truly tipsy. It could be that she was being giggly with her friends. That aside, if she did have a drinking problem, yelling at her is going to accomplish nothing. What do you plan to do? Lock her up and control every single thing she does? You can speak to her as an adult but ultimately it\u2019s her body.", "Just barely NTA, entirely because of extreme provocation.  Screaming at your spouse is not okay.  Threatening her with CPS involvement over one instance of poor judgment when you have no evidence of actual harm done is controlling and not okay.\n\nBut I imagine that after having lost two babies already, seeing your pregnant wife visibly drunk and slurring on social media while you\u2019re sitting home has got to be both terrifying and infuriating.  It\u2019s also a huge violation of the trust you need to have with your child\u2019s other parent - that both of you will always prioritize your child\u2019s safety and best interests.\n\nI would suggest therapy either together or for you alone if she\u2019s not interested.", "NTA. Sure maybe you could\u2019ve went about it calmer but i understand why you are upset and have any right to be. And I am NOT not a medical professional, but some studies and doctors do say a glass of wine during pregnancy is fine. Always talk to the doctor as well as a OBGYN. Being *DRUNK* during pregnancy is absolutely not okay and certainly drinking multiple glasses a day during pregnancy is not okay either.", "NTA and all of you claiming \"a few drinks/one glass of wine every now and then!\" Is fine or it's WORSE just to be yelled at once... y'all are factually incorrect and insane!! OP was totally justified in his anger. Of course, yelling at your pregnant spouse isn't a good idea, and CPS shouldn't have been threatened, I would definitely be pissed to the point of yelling if I was him.  NO AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL IS SAFE during pregnancy! If your wife is drunk enough to be slurring her words, that ain't one glass! A party is temporary,  fetal alcohol syndrome is a permanent disability for your child. Your wife maybe needs some therapy or something, if she does not understand how serious this is and is being flippant with the safety of y'all's unborn child.", "NTA - Just because she can, doesn\u2019t mean she should.  After two miscarriages, you\u2019d think she\u2019d err on the side of caution and do everything she can to have the healthiest baby.  Like saying you won\u2019t die if you try hard drugs once, so let\u2019s just do it once.  Plus I\u2019d be concerned if she drank enough to slur her words.  Who slurs their words after one and a half drinks?  She had way more than she\u2019s saying and only conceded to a little extra to pacify you.", " NTA she\u2019s willing to risk her baby\u2019s life and future. Fetal alcohol syndrome is serious and the earliest months are most important.", "NTA, she really put ur child on the line for some drinks which seems like she drank wayyyyy more than she's letting you believe. It starts with the trickle of truth, giving bits of pieces like she did before eventually revealing what she did. Ask her is she trying to purposely miscarry again because the way she's going can do that or give your baby problems. I've seethe affects of alcohol from my aunts partying and claiming \"1 tequila shot is fine or 1 bottle is okay\". You know what happened? They miscarried or my cousins came out with health and mental issues.", "NTA. You have a right to be angry and rightfully so. Research shows even small amounts of alcohol can be dangerous. Extremely stupid of her to risk the child\u2019s life for something so selfish. She\u2019s a grown ass woman. She needs to act like it. I never drank a sip even while being around it while pregnant.", "NTA. Seems like your wife cares more about partying than possibly permanently damaging her baby's brain.", "NTA for being upset with your wife\n\nMinor YTA for bringing CPS into it. Nobody is calling cps on you", "ESH: OP, I completely understand why you\u2019d be anxious about seeing your pregnant wife tipsy on social media. That would make me upset as well. \n\nBut you\u2019ve got to find a better way to communicate that. This is a moment for you and your wife to find a way to get that much better at communicating with one another, because life is about to get harder and more hectic for you both. You\u2019re both going to be running on little sleep and emotions and adrenaline and hormones are going all over the place. \n\nMy two cents: give it a little time and distance, and then apologize for reacting the way you did. You were right in how you felt but did a bad job conveying that.", "NTA: you could have handled it better but considering there's been two miscarriages, it seems extra irresponsible to drink to the point of slurring words. Unless you know she's a lightweight who is affected by just one or two drinks, she's also lying to you about how much she drank.", "NTA - fully justified in worrying about the health of your unborn child, especially after trying so hard to get pregnant in the first place.", "AM I the only cynic here who thinks her past actions may have contributed to previous miscarriages. If so, it may be that she doe not want to be pregnant and is self sabotaging. NTA. She had more drinks than she admitted to, but I have to wonder what type of friends drink that much with a pregnant woman", "NTA. Does she know how bad fetal alcohol syndrome is? Jesus Christ, has your wife always been such a selfish alcoholic? I'd be eyeing up divorce and going for full custody, she's clearly not fit to be a mother.", "NTA.  She needed to hear it.", "NTA. She needed a reality check. It\u2019s so sad that she doesn\u2019t care about her baby\u2019s well being. Hopefully she will be a decent mom the rest of the pregnancy.", "NTA - If it were ONLY one glass of wine or ONLY one mixed drink you would be the asshole.  I'm surprised anyone here is defending her drinking two different things at a bridal shower after her miscarriages.  Most women would not.  The truth is you don't even know if she is telling you the full amount.  You're getting the silent treatment because she knows she is wrong.", "INFO: is this the first/only time you have seen evidence of her drinking during the pregnancy? (and previous pregnancies). \n\nIf this was the only time, 2 drinks, then yelling at her was an AH move. You could\u2019ve just had a conversation and expressed your concerns, not scream at her & threaten her with CPS: I don\u2019t know how many people have to comment with the scientific data before people accept that a glass of wine DOES NOT hurt the fetus.\n\nIf you have actual concerns about her drinking in general, that\u2019s way more serious than this sub can handle and NAH, but potentially an alcoholic.", "the yta verdicts are wild. i\u2019d be upset too if my wife was drinking while pregnant after previous miscarriages too. NTA", "Nta\n\nThere is no safe Level of alcohol. Anyone who says otherwise is delusional.", "NTA... UM drinking while pregnant???! She is either very immature OR doesnt actually want the kid ! I suggest serious talk with her about what life she wants to live, some people want to be child free but feel pressured to have kid maybe she does too and that can be dealbreaker for you, honesty first, tell her concerns you have just dont yell anymore.", "NTA", "NTA if your wife already had 2 miscarriages she should know by now how fragile a fetus is.\nIt doesnt matter if it was just 1 glass of wine or a whole bottle. If you're pregnant, alcohol is a taboo. It maybe wasnt the best to confront her while still drunk but I understand where that reaction came from.", "NTA - sluring and giggly after just one wine and a mixed drink? \n\nAs glad as I am that bubs is healthy in the scans I think you may need to talk to a lawyer. She\u2019s willing to harm the baby while it\u2019s still inside her, is she really ready to be a mother?", "Nta. What your wife did was careless and dangerous.", "NTA! Yes, you can have a glass of wine whilst pregnant, it\u2019s absolutely fine to do that, it will not harm your baby.  A glass of wine and a weak cocktail, whilst irresponsible will not harm your baby, however if you\u2019re saying she was slurring then it seems as though she had a lot more to drink than that and being drunk is definitely harmful to your baby.  You have every right to be mad!", "NTA. There is no safe amount of alcohol in pregnancy and certainly getting drunk is a problem. I'm pregnant for the third time in 4.5 years, my pregnancies have all been uncomplicated and I've had zero miscarriages or even scares. Id lpve a drink but it can wait, like 99+% of other pregnant people. Your wife claimed to want a kid with you, had losses and still drank while pregnant. Watch out for perinatal depression and postpartum depression when the time comes", "NTA NTA NTA WTF", "Maybe a soft Y T A for yelling, but overall NTA for being concerned about this. NO amount of alcohol is considered safe during pregnancy.", "ESH\n\nYou know what else is  bad for a pregnancy? Stress.", "NTA she probably has done this before, people don't do this kind of thing as a one off.\n\nShe's drinking while pregnant, disgraceful", "NTA", "NTA for being upset. There is no safe risk for alcohol during pregnancy. & she could be reported but it\u2019d be flagged for when she gives birth. But the risk of FASD can happen even with two drinks.", "You'd think after 2 miscarriages, she'd be so careful about everything!  I have a friend who has an adopted child who is severely screwed up because the mother drank while pregnant.  It's heartbreaking the life he has because of his mom's choices.  Any drinking during pregnancy is reckless, I would be so angry if in your shoes.  Did she tell the OB about her drinking?  I am not so sure everything is fine, can that show up immediately?  Your wife and her friends are the AHs.", "ESH.

You threatening the state against her which is abusive af. YTA.", "NTA. I would have screamed, without a doubt.\n\nI have no words. Alcohol is absolutely forbidden in pregnancies, every sip could be bad for the child.\nSomeone pointed out your wife could have a drinking problem, I second that. She needs help, immediately.\n\n All the best.", "Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is so so so harmful and impacts the brain in ways science is still trying to figure out. I work with young people who have been impacted, and it is heartbreaking to see them struggle when it was so easily avoided. \n\nIt inhibits an individual's reasoning and impulsiveness... did your wife's mother drink through pregnancy? This could explain why she is making such poor choices now. \n\n\nBut yeah, NTA.", "ESH. It sounds like your wife might have a drinking problem, if she got drunk to the point of slurring while pregnant, particularly at an age where she should be more in control. And then lied about it repeatedly when you asked her about it.\n\nYelling at her was counter-productive though. Perhaps you have argued about her alcohol use before? One time being drunk is not likely to harm the baby, it seems like there are more issues here that need to be handled with empathy and understanding.", "As someone who\u2019s dad had heath problems due to my grandmother drinking. It\u2019s quite serious and yes just a couple drinks can hurt the baby and lead to health problems later in life. \n\nWhat I\u2019m gonna do is not drink for the entire time my wife is pregnant. Because if I don\u2019t drink then she won\u2019t have the urge to drink as well. Also it our pregnancy not just her pregnancy. It\u2019s a team effort and I think me not drinking as well caters to that. \n\nBut I think ESH \n\nYour wife obviously shouldn\u2019t be drinking while pregnant but also how you handled it by yelling and screaming at your wife and stressing her out is also not good for your baby\u2019s health and your wife\u2019s.", "NTA. No amount of alcohol is safe in pregnancy.", "NTA. You can\u2019t have any alcohol while pregnant.\n\nFor the downvoters, here:\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/alcohol-use.html", "No, completely justified.", "YTA. She had two glasses of wine which is totally ok during pregnancy occasionally. You stressing her with your yelling (adults are not supposed to yell at each other) was probably more stressful and it was controlling. This is her body and her choice, unless we are actually talking about alcohol abuse (which I suppose we are not).", "Maybe an unpopular opinion but YTA. Your method of approaching her was terrible. Also read the book Expecting Better.", "Info: OP were you consuming alcohol whilst you were trying to conceive the child? \n\nStudies show the quality and quantity of the sperm is reduced. If you were consuming, you have actually caused some of the issues around miscarriage perhaps\u2026and could do damage to the kiddo.", "YTA - for all those espousing fetal alcohol system you know crap.  This is about drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.  Most OBs will tell women a glass of wine is fine especially later in the pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, you are basically telling her that she has zero control over her body during pregnancy or CPS will be involved.  \n\nIt is one thing if she is doing this constantly but it sounds like this was a one time celebration and instead of controlling your emotions and concerns like an adult you verbally abuse your wife.  Good luck with co parenting in the future.", "YTA. This might not have been the best decision on her part but if this was just a one time thing your reaction was over the top.", "YTA and probably upsetting her like that is more dangerous than 1.5 drinks one off. \n\n\nI understand your concern but yelling never helped no one ever and stress is very dangerous.", "ESH. Your wife shouldn't have had a glass of wine, but you shouldn't have yelled at her either.", "CPS will absolutely not become involved. Like it or not, she gets to do what she wants with her body.   \nIt isn\u2019t until a kid is born addicted that they\u2019ll step in. A couple drinks won\u2019t do it. \n\nUnfortunately, you picked her. You\u2019re stuck.   \n\n\nFind a good lawyer. You\u2019ll need one.", "YTA. So, your wife, a grown up, had a drink and a half, you saw a short video on social media where she was laughing at a party, and your response is to yell at her? The idea of CPS being called is absurd because you don\u2019t have a CHILD. You have a pregnant wife. We have not slid so far down just yet that we send child services after potential children. I understand you are nervous but this is an insane reaction. Alcohol is not a magic abortive, no matter which opinion you accept about its effect on a fetus. Your concern needs to be for your wife. Get your head right.", "YTA. The stress of being yelled at could be more damaging than the couple of drinks she had. You could have handled this a lot better.", "I mean you're NTA for being upset if she got drunk, but you threatened to call CPS on your wife and for that, also YTA.", "YTA for being so harsh.  Learn to communicate in loving manner if you love her.", "YTA.", "ESH. Any amount of alcohol can cause damage, although it is less likely with <2 drinks once during the course of a pregnancy, but you wayyyy overreacted. Stress can also hurt the fetus, and yelling at your pregnant wife is not conducive to anything positive.", "NTA...How irresponsible of her and then she is acting wrong and strong \ud83d\ude12...jeez\n\nReally hope the baby remains healthy and she has a safe birth", "NTA. She should be way more careful and shouldn't be drinking at all especially considering the past. She sounds like a lunatic and like she doesn't care about your child's safety. Take the baby and run after she gives birth, who knows how she will act after it's born.", "Y T A. Yelling at a pregnant person can be stressful enough to cause problems. Also I think there might be more than enough anxiety there already, no need to add to it. There are some people, myself included, that can act a bit drunk with very little alcohol.", "ESH\n\nYou could have been much calmer in your approach.\n\nWife also sucks for getting carried away, which could have easily resulted in the baby getting miscarried away.", "YTA for yelling at her like that. You\u2019re an adult communicate better. But she\u2019s the AH for drinking while pregnant when there\u2019s a history of miscarriages especially. You\u2019re not wrong for being upset you\u2019re wrong for your reaction.", "ESH\n\nMostly her !\n\nSo drinking well pregnant is terrible and being uncaring enough to pay it in social media like how little does she care about this baby??\n\nBut guess what are is bad too!!! ...

I want my baby/child to have EVERY advantage in life they can, especially when it comes to good health.

It's creepy.\n\nSecond, you confronted your supposedly slurringly drunk wife the minute she got home. There's a distinct lack of you saying she smelled like booze or was still acting drunk. So she sobered up completely between being sloppy drunk at the party and getting home?\n\nThird, she was following guidelines currently given by OBs. Small amounts of alcohol later in pregnancies are generally safe. She told you how much she had drunk. You kept hounding her.\n\nFourth, do you think her friends would let her drink to excess while pregnant, then film her drunk, then post it to social media? I'm betting she was giggly because she's at a party and isn't used to any alcohol anymore.

You didn\u2019t need to yell to save someone\u2019s life in a loud environment.\n\nScreaming like you did is about terrorizing someone in to submission. \n\nAnd for the record, criminalizing behavior while pregnant isn\u2019t about health - it means women are less likely to seek help for actual substance abuse problems. It\u2019s just about punishing women. \n\n> We are very cautious because of our past losses.\n\nThis is a problem that needs to be addressed. Miscarriages are not her fault - the notion that if you just behave perfectly will guarantee a healthy, live birth implies that it was a lack of care that led to a miscarriage.
