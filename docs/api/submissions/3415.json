I came home for Thanksgiving this week, and since I live several states away I really only see my brother like once or twice a year.

I\u2019ll have a conversation with you but if you\u2019re just going to sit here and make weird noises, I\u2019m going to leave.\u201d \n\nI defended myself and said like, what the heck, you see me once a year and you\u2019re just so annoyed with my presence you can\u2019t stand to be around me? Then he called me selfish and said I need to adjust my behavior depending on who I\u2019m with and that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around me. I thought this was just insane, since he\u2019s the one dictating how I should behave! \n\nI feel so gaslit and hurt in this situation, but idk, maybe I\u2019m the asshole?\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR I made noises while my brother watched football and he acted like I was a selfish bitch for doing so", "created_utc": 1669584850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6dbcv/aita_for_making_noises_while_my_brother_watched/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can kiss your dog without making kissy noises. It's fine to kiss your dog, just do it quietly. It is very annoying when someone is making noise, whether it be kissy noises, talking, whatever, while a person is trying to watch something on tv. If you weren't interested in watching the games, you had two choices. You could sit quietly in the tv room while reading a book, playing games on your phone, or some other quiet activity, or you could go to another room and be noisy in there. Also, the average football game airtime is three hours. There are only two games that are played on Thanksgiving. That means he was watching games for six hours, not ten.
