But maybe they can enjoy their lake view and wonder why people don't wanna hang out.", "I don't want to turn this in the three millionth comment thread on \"tipping culture\" but its different in the US. Gratuity is expected, our sales tax (sorta like VAT) is not inclusive. For larger parties in the US historically the total bill is provided on one slip and it's up to the party to sort out how it's going to be divided. \n\nThis is kind of turning into a derail, OP is NTA, I was just more addressing the point \"you all have calculators why can't you just sort it\".", "Fair enough. It's just that we've been whipping out our phones at restaurant tables for twenty years, and we didn't realise it hasn't been a thing in the US until recent times", "Mainly, context. It is a difficult construct, and it is difficult to separate them sometimes.\n\nBut a kind of weird and unfortunate side-effect of how the West has evolved regarding discourse on ethnicity and race is that we seem to use identifiers like \"Welsh, Irish, Chinese, Japanese, Kenyan, Maasai, Cherokee, Anishinaabe\" to designate culture first and ethnicity second. When we're not talking about culture, we often switch to \"race\" instead (white, asian, black, native american, aboriginal), even though racial designation is incredibly broad and has the unfortunate effect of lumping totally distinct peoples together in one giant blob (a Black American, after all, has basically nothing to do culturally with a black person from Kenya, and a black person from Kenya likely has no meaningful cultural or ethnic connection to a black person from Zimbabwe).\n\nWhat that means is that the use of terms like \"Irish\" to designate an ethnic identity has been severely weakened and pushed aside a lot in modern discourse. When people say they're Irish, what a lot of people hear is \"I'm a person from Ireland who grew up in Irish culture\", even if they're not what you'd consider ethnically Irish (for example, they might be the children of recent immigrants). You might assume they're white, because most ethnically Irish people are classified as \"white\" these days, even though they weren't a hundred years ago. It's similar to how if someone says they're Navajo, you assume they're Native Americans of the Navajo culture, even though any Native American will tell you that it's also an ethnic identity because they're not all one homogeneous group, culturally nor ethnically. In short, we've taken to using racial identifiers and attaching them to cultural identities to describe people, rather than using the cultural identity to describe the ethnic identity. \n\nIn some ways, this is good. It means that we're pulling away from a time when we widely believed that traits like intelligence and virtue or vice were genetically inherent to different groups, and thus used these terms as a way to say that failings and shortcomings were inherent to an entire ethnicity or sub-group. I still get shocked when I read old writings from a hundred to a hundred and fifty years ago, and see white Colonialists describing other people as if they had characteristics that were inherent to them-- the way we talk about dogs, like when we say that some dog breeds are calm and intelligent, or describe other breeds as being willful and prone to disobedience and destruction. We still talk that way, just generally not about people anymore, and thank goodness. \n\nIn other ways, it's not so good, because again, it means a lot of people blank out on the importance of recognizing that a white person in America has a totally different experience and history than an ethnically Irish person from Ireland, or an ethnically Welsh person from Wales, who may have to deal with a great deal of cultural suppression (of language, food, religion, etc.). That suppression was historically rooted in racism, which is to say, it was historically rooted in beliefs about people based on their ethnicity and genetic heritage. These days, that suppression is usually rooted in a disdain for the culture, because an ethnically Irish person in Britain who is raised like a Brit, walks like a Brit, talks like a Brit, and eats like a Brit, and doesn't carry a hint of Irish culture in them is probably not going to face much actual racism. \n\n> reject the use of any ethnic/linguistic/cultural/racial/gender identity etc labels that have at an time been used to denigrate a group of people\n\nThat's understandable and laudable, but what about when people of that culture don't particularly mind the usage, or use it themselves, or have reclaimed it?\n\nThere's a whole lot of labels I can think of that just aren't reclaimable. But not only has the Irish Goodbye lost a lot of its colonial baggage, it's inspired a whole slew of other \"goodbye\" variants-- like the Minnesota goodbye, the Greek goodbye, the Canadian goodbye, the Italian goodbye, and the Pittsburgh goodbye. Because of that, \"The Irish Goodbye\" now blends in with them as clear cultural descriptors, and not ones that reflect badly on the Irish. (Some of these variants are really quite funny, too)\n\nI think it's worth pointing out that in this case, trying to push against the use of \"the Irish goodbye\" when it exists among half a dozen other goodbye variants is a bad idea. It's pushing for people to take a negative slant on just *that* one in particular, and to deliberately form a negative interpretation that requires engagement in an outdated (and bad) thought process in order to see it. Irish people are doing a lot to protect and preserve their culture against forced Anglicization and the spectre of colonialism, but I feel like the fact that \"the Irish goodbye\" has lost its colonial meaning is actually a strike against colonialism, because the weapon's had its teeth knocked out. It used to be a weapon designed to damage the Irish reputation and character, now it isn't.", "You seem like a blast at parties", "Yes it reminds me of my friend when he was staying at my house one night after clubbing. It was about 4am and we wanted cigarettes. There was a shop beside my house and I went up and got a 20 box. Its Ireland too so they are expensive.\n\nI paid for them and we smoked a cigarette each and he was sleeping on the sofa and I was upstairs in my room. I left the box of cigarettes in the living room where he was sleeping and told him he could smoke more if he wanted and I went to bed.\n\nYep you guessed it, he took them home the next day. It really annoyed me and it wasn't even the cost aspect. It was the principle, that he totally abused my hospitality, in my own house too. That was about 13 years ago and it still pisses me off. \n\nThere's just something violating about it if you get me? I can't put my finger quite on it but it's like you did something nice for them and they abuse it sort of. Or give an inch take a metre.", "And was he trying to split the bill unfairly?

I wish we could get there. \n\nI can\u2019t do a wire with my personal online login, I have to physically go into a bank branch. And it still costs me at least $15 to do a domestic wire, closer to $50 for international.
