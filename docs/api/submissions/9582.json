Gratuity is expected, our sales tax (sorta like VAT) is not inclusive. For larger parties in the US historically the total bill is provided on one slip and it's up to the party to sort out how it's going to be divided. \n\nThis is kind of turning into a derail, OP is NTA, I was just more addressing the point \"you all have calculators why can't you just sort it\".", "Fair enough. It's just that we've been whipping out our phones at restaurant tables for twenty years, and we didn't realise it hasn't been a thing in the US until recent times", "Mainly, context. It is a difficult construct, and it is difficult to separate them sometimes.\n\nBut a kind of weird and unfortunate side-effect of how the West has evolved regarding discourse on ethnicity and race is that we seem to use identifiers like \"Welsh, Irish, Chinese, Japanese, Kenyan, Maasai, Cherokee, Anishinaabe\" to designate culture first and ethnicity second. When we're not talking about culture, we often switch to \"race\" instead (white, asian, black, native american, aboriginal), even though racial designation is incredibly broad and has the unfortunate effect of lumping totally distinct peoples together in one giant blob (a Black American, after all, has basically nothing to do culturally with a black person from Kenya, and a black person from Kenya likely has no meaningful cultural or ethnic connection to a black person from Zimbabwe).\n\nWhat that means is that the use of terms like \"Irish\" to designate an ethnic identity has been severely weakened and pushed aside a lot in modern discourse. When people say they're Irish, what a lot of people hear is \"I'm a person from Ireland who grew up in Irish culture\", even if they're not what you'd consider ethnically Irish (for example, they might be the children of recent immigrants). You might assume they're white, because most ethnically Irish people are classified as \"white\" these days, even though they weren't a hundred years ago. It's similar to how if someone says they're Navajo, you assume they're Native Americans of the Navajo culture, even though any Native American will tell you that it's also an ethnic identity because they're not all one homogeneous group, culturally nor ethnically. In short, we've taken to using racial identifiers and attaching them to cultural identities to describe people, rather than using the cultural identity to describe the ethnic identity. \n\nIn some ways, this is good. It means that we're pulling away from a time when we widely believed that traits like intelligence and virtue or vice were genetically inherent to different groups, and thus used these terms as a way to say that failings and shortcomings were inherent to an entire ethnicity or sub-group. I still get shocked when I read old writings from a hundred to a hundred and fifty years ago, and see white Colonialists describing other people as if they had characteristics that were inherent to them-- the way we talk about dogs, like when we say that some dog breeds are calm and intelligent, or describe other breeds as being willful and prone to disobedience and destruction. We still talk that way, just generally not about people anymore, and thank goodness. \n\nIn other ways, it's not so good, because again, it means a lot of people blank out on the importance of recognizing that a white person in America has a totally different experience and history than an ethnically Irish person from Ireland, or an ethnically Welsh person from Wales, who may have to deal with a great deal of cultural suppression (of language, food, religion, etc.). That suppression was historically rooted in racism, which is to say, it was historically rooted in beliefs about people based on their ethnicity and genetic heritage. These days, that suppression is usually rooted in a disdain for the culture, because an ethnically Irish person in Britain who is raised like a Brit, walks like a Brit, talks like a Brit, and eats like a Brit, and doesn't carry a hint of Irish culture in them is probably not going to face much actual racism. \n\n> reject the use of any ethnic/linguistic/cultural/racial/gender identity etc labels that have at an time been used to denigrate a group of people\n\nThat's understandable and laudable, but what about when people of that culture don't particularly mind the usage, or use it themselves, or have reclaimed it?\n\nThere's a whole lot of labels I can think of that just aren't reclaimable. But not only has the Irish Goodbye lost a lot of its colonial baggage, it's inspired a whole slew of other \"goodbye\" variants-- like the Minnesota goodbye, the Greek goodbye, the Canadian goodbye, the Italian goodbye, and the Pittsburgh goodbye. Because of that, \"The Irish Goodbye\" now blends in with them as clear cultural descriptors, and not ones that reflect badly on the Irish. (Some of these variants are really quite funny, too)\n\nI think it's worth pointing out that in this case, trying to push against the use of \"the Irish goodbye\" when it exists among half a dozen other goodbye variants is a bad idea. It's pushing for people to take a negative slant on just *that* one in particular, and to deliberately form a negative interpretation that requires engagement in an outdated (and bad) thought process in order to see it. Irish people are doing a lot to protect and preserve their culture against forced Anglicization and the spectre of colonialism, but I feel like the fact that \"the Irish goodbye\" has lost its colonial meaning is actually a strike against colonialism, because the weapon's had its teeth knocked out. It used to be a weapon designed to damage the Irish reputation and character, now it isn't.", "You seem like a blast at parties", "Yes it reminds me of my friend when he was staying at my house one night after clubbing.

The fact we're Irish AMERICANS doesn't dilute the fact we have history around being Irish, and a lot of us find that identity important, even if that's unusual for the rest of the world.

Imagine that after they were showed how important they are for us, they started asking for a bigger raise from my husband. They were mad that the raise wasn't what they wished, even though it was according to the company's rules. The husband kept leaving his job to work in a different country, then coming back and expecting to have the same job saved for him.

I delayed giving the divorce papers till the next day after the baptism. I told her that the fact that i divorce her brother has nothing to do with his family and i hope she will stay in baby 1's life. She knew why i was divorcing him, she told me that he's a bad man and what he did was wrong and she's not going to take sides.\n\nThen she began trying to convince me not to divorce and when i asked her to just enjoy her time with her niece and not try to force me to stay in a bad marriage, she begin to tell lies about me in order to save the appearances and his brother's \"face\". \n\nI remember how she said that she isn't the kind of person to lie. \n\nThen she lied to every cps worker and in court. I had proof and i won what i wanted and during the 3 years of divorce proceedings prelonged by her and her family's lies i told her that for now on i would like her not to talk to me about anything else regarding her brother. \n\nWe're not in contact anymore. Her choice. \n\nBaby 2 had also a godmother. My husband didn't want to ask his own godmother to be the godmother of baby 2 because we wanted something small and gift free event (it's uncommon in our country and many people don't understand why). One of his coworkers (and friend of him) gifted us a body for the baby while i was 5 months pregnant. We thought she might be a good choice because she seemed to like us and the idea. Well, it wasn't. \n\nGuess what upset her? She didn't get a raise big enough from my husband. \n\nHe did gave her more than she should have received, but she thought that spending her working hours on social media instead of working, coming to work at 9-10-11 am and leaving at 3 pm, all should have been forgiven because she was the godmother. \n\nShe left the job for another one, she then ghosted me (i don't know why, i didn't do or said a thing, we didn't talk about her job, only about the baby), and when she saw that her new boss doesn't want her to be late and expects her to actually work at work, plus the comute was at least 2 hours every day, she started going by my husband's job to \"visit\". I told him i'm sure she wants her old job back (there's a new employee there), we just wait and see when she's going to say something. \n\nShe still doesn't talk to me, even though i had nothing to do with her raise or quitting. \n\nMy husband has a job he loves, he's very good at his job and i love him and respect him enough not to interfere with his choices. It's his job, he knows what to do. I know what's happening there because we always talk about our days. \n\n\nI told you this very long story in order to make you understand our joke: if we want to break up with some friends, we should ask them to be godparents at our religious ceremony \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude05.", "NTA\nNumber one rule of dining with a group: decide how the bill will be split BEFORE anyone orders.", "NTA.

But, why in the world do you continually put yourself in that situation to point where you feel the need to pay and run without a goodbye? The solution is simple.

I guarantee that will stop people from going overboard on their orders and ordering what they can afford. \n\nI\u2019m also curious: do they think they can get away with this because you took them out one time and paid for everyone?
