In my experience much more common in the uk than the USA", "It\u2019s leaving without saying your goodbyes. But I have never in my life heard it to be insulting from Irish friends or otherwise.", "An Irish exit is when you just leave. No goodbye. Just take off. I didn't know it was an offensive term tho. I definitely use it. Just like MN goodbye or Midwestern goodby-which is the total opposite. You say bye a million times, inching closer and closer to the door until finally 2 hrs later you're on the road home.", "> Irish exit\n\nGoogle has it covered.", "AKA \"French leave\". When you just vanish. It's not an insult.", "I agree fully with you. Whenever I order \"appetizers for the table,\" it's either because I'm *buying* the appetizer for the table (because I like the people I'm eating with and want to), or I discuss in advance who wants in so we can account for it on the bill accordingly. The folks I typically go out to eat with follow the same standard.", ">Also the phrase \"Irish exit\" is kind of bigoted and ignorant.\n\nI'm Irish, and I've never found it bigoted, but I've also never understood it. My experience is that Irish people take forever and a half to leave with about 30 attempts at \"Ah I should be going then\" which get stopped with conversation and more tea until finally you end up with \"Okay well it's past time now lads, I'm up early in the morning.\"", "I\u2019m Irish. The term \u201cIrish goodbye\u201d is not bigoted, ignorant, or anything offensive. Don\u2019t listen to this SJW.", "It\u2019s sometimes called a \u201cFrench exit,\u201d where you just disappear without saying goodbye to anyone or being seen.", "To leave a party without saying goodbye to the host is known as a 'French exit' in the UK, an 'Irish exit' in the US, a 'Polish exit' in Germany and an 'English exit' in France.\n\n\"Early versions of the term Irish Exit come from Irish Americans leaving social functions like Church, football games, and plays. When the functions let out people would congregate outside and chat with each person they knew and say goodbye before heading home. This usually added 30 minuets to an hour to the evening. When there was little or no time to do the customary goodbye, the family would leave through the side door. The side door move became known as the Irish Exit.\"\n\nLiterally nothing to do with racism but rather a stereotype caused by Irish Americans, each country has its own name because of which ethnic group would do it most commonly.\n\nIt's also called \"Dutch leave\" by some, can't find out which country though.\n\nIts kinda ethnophobic, should you be offended? No... its not really an offensive thing, its like the \"Asians are smart\" stereotype. It falls into the \"overly sensitive\" part. If you don't like it, just don't use it...", "Nope, not racist at all, Irish goodbyes are a thing.", "not racist in the least", "I don't think Irish people are a race", "> However, I'm downgrading you to AH-in-chief for \"Irish exit\". What the racist fuckery, mate?\n\nOh ffs. I'm irish born and bred and I love it. Stop looking for offense.", "Which part is racist, exactly?", "The way you have it is. Are you upset that Irish people are on the planet and exist? Lol\n\nBut seriously, the Irish exit (or goodbye as my Irish friends call it) is not a slur. I\u2019m sure you can find a few Irish people offended by it, but most Irish people have awesome and wicked senses of humor and they absolutely use this phrase themselves (even about themselves!)\u2026 at least the Irish (from Ireland even) friends I have.", "> Irish exit\" is a slur,\n\nLOL, no. Not everything 'ethnic' is an immoral characterization.", "You literally made that up, stop making everything a slur. When everything is a slur, nothing is a slur. Good grief", "Wtf?", "I'm sorry I didn't know.  I can't edit the title.", "Literal Irish people are fine with it. Stop going out of your way to speak for groups you have no association with.", "That's not what \"Irish exit\" means. It means to leave without saying goodbye, not to dine-and-dash. It's not an insult.", "> Also, in the age of Venmo who the hell splits a bill evenly anymore!?! \n\nPeople who don't want to do math? As long as people keep things roughly even, it's easier to just divide a bill than it is to tally up stuff from the itemized receipt. Venmo just means I don't carry cash.", "I've heard it theorized that the English coined the term to paint the Irish as \"rude and discourteous\".", "That's why I was confused, it's a badge of pride for myself. \n\n20 years under my belt of flawless Irish goodbyes.", "I think the idea behind it is something to do with being drunk - like you sneak out drunk before everyone at the party realizes how drunk you were.  Which feels less Irish and more\u2026.me. That\u2019s what I do. I am guilty.", "I'm Irish too and this is my understanding", "The term \"Irish Exit\" implies that Irish people are prone to leaving social gatherings without saying goodbye or bc they're too drunk to do so. So it may not be offensive to you but it was meant to be offensive lol", "I think it's a thing where the area you live in calls it something different. So dipping where I live is an Irish goodbye but we call the lingering MN goodbye or Midwestern good bye. Obviously some terms are more universal than others.", "Irish Goodbye is what I\u2019ve always heard and it refers to leaving the bar without saying goodbye to everyone.", "We call this \"milling\" in my family. Trying to leave but standing around for another hour chatting.", "I've been saying it since 2003 about myself \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019ve always heard it as an \u201cIrish goodbye\u201d, and I learned it from my Irish friend.", "You don't need to, real Irish people dgaf", "Do not listen to these blowhards looking to be offended on behalf of the people who don\u2019t find it offensive.", "Literal Irish people are also not fine with it. How tf do you know whether this person has any association or not?", "I can assure you that I have \u201cassociation\u201c, which is actually a weird way to say I am Irish.  I think it\u2019s insulting to describe sneaking away as an Irish trait.", "Leaving without saying goodbye is impolite and cruse and calling it an \"Irish exit\" goes back to the English colonial/imperialist days when then Irish were all supposed to be uncouth and crude so yes it is absolutely an insult\n\n:crude", "Someone further down in the comments said it\u2019s an American thing to refer to it as such, and that other countries have the same concept but just attach a different nationality to it.", "Some ridiculous looking to be offended geniuses in the comments is all", "I think it's actually just sneaking out so you don't have to say goodbye to your 80 family members for an additional hour. That's how my Irish family does it. It's hilarious that everyone is just trying to avoid everyone else.", "It's because the Irish are a talkative people and when you start saying goodbye, it takes hours to go through and speak to everyone before you leave. So it's easier to just quietly slip away. I don't care if other people want to think it's offensive.", "Same. Never heard the \u201cFrench\u201d iteration.", "So your family is know for milling about", "Irish heritage here and my family always uses Irish Goodbye! We also call it Houdini-ing. And we're proud of it \ud83e\udd23", "I have Irish family members. They are fine with it. Irish people in other comments have said they are fine with it. Check yourself next time, maybe do a bit of research before you speak on the behalf of others, yeah?", "I'm Irish too, with family still living there. You and that other commenter who are arguing with me seem to be the exception to Irish folks who have no issues with the term.", "We do. It's actually a long running family joke about how bad we are at milling and how long it takes us to go anywhere.\n\nWe are not Irish, however.", "I have lived in Ireland. My grandfather emigrated from Ireland. I have no need to check myself but thanks.", "Just because you have no issues, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok. There are plenty people in the world who think it\u2019s ok to say certain other slurs for other nationalities, religions, sexuality, gender, colour etc. It doesn\u2019t make it ok.  You think it\u2019s ok, that\u2019s fine in your own company of like minded people, but  slurs on people are generally not acceptable in 2023.", "Well then we both have Irish blood in us. I have no issues with it, but you apparently do. None of the fine Irish folks I know have any issue with it. Maybe it's just you.", "It's not a fucking slur it's figure of speech.", "Coming from the person who just criticized me for speaking on behalf of others this is an interesting take. I\u2019m going to take a wild guess that you haven\u2019t met the vast majority of Ireland\u2019s population, let alone discussed this issue with them, so perhaps don\u2019t assume that a small sample group is representative of an entire nation\u2019s opinion. There\u2019s a whole country full of people with perspectives you know nothing about. \n\nAnd for the record, there are Irish people who associate the origins of the term Irish goodbye with the Famine. To quote the first non scholarly but clear explanation google provided: It attributes the phrase to \"the Potato Famine of 1845-1852, when many Irish fled their homeland for America. At the time, distance and technology meant that when someone went to America, they were gone forever and it was unlikely they would ever again speak to or see friends or family back home. The departure was sudden and absolute.\""]}
