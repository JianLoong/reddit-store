Last week my uncle and aunt had to leave the city for a couple of days and they asked me if my cousin could sleep at my house, because they don't like leaving him alone in their house. I said yes. They were leaving on wednesday afternoon and coming back friday afternoon, so my cousin was going to wake up in my house thursday and friday.\n\nI work from home from 4am to 12:30pm, and usually just eat my breakfast at my 8:00am \"lunch\" break. My cousin goes to school from 8:00am to 1:00pm, the school is a short walk away from our houses and he walks to school everyday. (Is like 5 blocks away). I told him I was going to be working when he needed to leave for school so he needed to take care of his own breakfast, I told him he could grab anything he wanted from my kitchen if he wanted to cook or he could just eat a bowl of cereal if he didn't feel like cooking.\n\nI did cook him lunchs and dinners of course.\n\nSo, today my aunt called me angry. She told me she received a call today from school saying my cousin was late for school two days in a row thursday and friday. And when she confronted him about it, he said he overslept because I didn't wake him up and on the top of that he needed to take care of his own breakfast.\n\nI let my aunt know this is because I had to work from 4am to 12:30 pm and by my lunch break at 8:00 he already needed to be in school. (She knew I work the morning shift, but I don't think I have told her my exact schedule before to be fair). She told me I should have taken my lunch break earlier to make sure he woke up on time and serve him breakfast before sending him to school. I told her a 17 years old could figure out how to serve a bowl of cereal and I usually took care of my own breakfast when I was in high school. She told me it's not the same thing because I'm a girl so it's easier for me. I found that sexist and I let her know that before disconnecting the call.\n\nI don't regret calling her sexist, but I now feel kinda guilty for the whole situation, maybe I should have let my aunt and uncle know that I was not available between 4am to 12:30m before accepting letting my cousin stay in my house.

He should be fully capable at this point of setting an alarm for himself on his phone, and of making himself a bowl of cereal.

Aunt and uncle probably insisted so he would have someone to take care of him, since they obviously feel he deserved to have a female making his life easier. Your aunt knew you worked from home.

No, aunt and uncle should have told you that they have failed to teach their son how to wake up on time and feed himself a bowl of cereal. Then you could have been adequately informed that they needed an actual BABYSITTER instead of just a safe place for their son who is one year away from becoming a legal adult. You could have then recommended they hire a person to wake him up and help him change out of his jammies into school clothes and pour the cereal and milk into a bowl and then spoon feed him and wipe his chin and make sure he had his backpack before he went to school.

I'm from Nicaragua. This is the first time in my life I heard its easier for a girl to grab breakfast. \n\nTo be completely honest my aunt and I didnt discuss this at all.

I don't blame him for getting a bit out-of-sorts about it; he's been taught a lesson in self-reliance and hopefully it will stick for next time.\n\nBut the mother getting upset about it is completely inappropriate. The parents didn't discuss any wake up or meal requirements with OP prior to leaving. It's on THEM to provide those requirements, not on OP to volunteer information about their schedule. \n\nIf they wanted OP to help him, it should have been negotiated *before* OP agreed to take their child in.", "In another comment, OP says they're latino.\n\nAlthough things are changing, it's still common in many latino families that children live with their parents until marriage, at which point the boys just shift the responsibility for household stuff from the mom to the wife. The gender roles are strongly defined and strictly enforced. And if the couple happens to get divorced, it's even common to see the man move *back* in with his mother.", "Surprising, because I also live in Latin America and I've met a lot of families who consider men to be kind of \"helpless\" around the house and that it's a woman's role to take care of all these little details. As a man, I've had women ask me why I know how to cook and do laundry. It's weird to me, but there's a subset of the culture here that believes in very clearly delineated gender roles. Is it not the same in Nicaragua?\n\nIt sounds like your aunt assumed you subscribed to the same gender norms as she does, which is why it didn't occur to her to specify what would be involved in having her son stay with you. She assumed that, because you're female, you would know you need to cater to (*infantilize*, in my view) a boy who is clearly old enough to take care of himself. It seems this all comes down to a failure to communicate. \n\nThe boy himself has probably never needed to take care of this stuff and be personally responsible, so I cannot really put the blame on him. The parenting hasn't prepared him to live without a woman taking care of his basic needs.", "Did she pay you for babysitting?", "Yeah he\u2019s probably never been in this situation before because all his life mommy has done everything for him.", "Where in Latin America do you live? (Just curious). \n\nAnd yes Nicaragua can be really sexist, I've heard a lot of dumb and sexist stuff over the years, specially from older people, but its the first time in my life I heard its easier for a girl to grab breakfast, that was just plain bizarre.", "Panam\u00e1.\n\nI don't think it was specifically about the breakfast, even though she phrased it that way. I think it was just part of your aunt's whole outlook that it's the responsibility of the woman in the house to make sure the men/boys get fed and get out the door on time. There's a general view that men cannot take care of themselves, or should not have to, because it's the woman's job. \n\nI saw a post on here a while ago about a young woman from El Salvador who was told by her mother to go get a drink for her brother. The young woman's response was, \"He has legs.\" This frustrated her mother. There's a generational shift happening right now.", "One other thought to add...\n\nThe fact that your aunt and uncle didn't want to leave a 17 year-old home alone for two nights with an older relative next door demonstrates that they're not parenting him to be independent. In a lot of cultures, they might have just asked you to check in on him every once in a while or invite him for dinner, but them asking him to stay with you indicates he probably hasn't been raised to cook, clean and be responsible for himself.", "Oh yes, I have heard this logic before. Mostly from older people but I have encoutered people my age that seems to subscribe to this too. Thanks heaven my parents are not like this.", "Me parece que es bastante com\u00fan en Nicaragua, Salvador y Guatemala, especialmente en los pueblos rurales.", "Si, aqui si me lo he encontrado. Nunca habia visto alguien que creyera que un hombre no se podia servir cereal, pero si he visto cosas coml que a una primita de 7 a\u00f1os la ponian a lavar los uniformes de su hermano de 12 y cosas asi.", "Es un buen ejemplo. Cosas as\u00ed son parte de la cultura, aunque est\u00e1 cambiando.\n\n(I hope it's not weird that I snooped your history a bit and saw the post about your accent. I've taught spoken English to a few professionals with a focus on improving their pronunciation. Let me know if I can be of any help.)", "NTA. I was confused about why the 17 y.o. wasn't just left in the comfort of his own home next door with you checking in on him. Now I see it. Zero life skills.", "NTA, ignoring the fact that a 17-year-old should be capable of feeding themselves once a day (and I do understand that schools have hours that absolutely work the opposite as what the healthiest for teenagers) they asked you to let him sleep on your couch, they didn't ask you to wake him up and feed him and you explained that you were working. And Like, people don't generally get to choose their lunch breaks that is absolutely not how that works.", "Oh please!   Bet the brat has a phone with an alarm that he was too lazy to set.   If he can\u2019t figure out how to make a bowl of cereal then he will never make it in life.   His worthless mommy should have stayed home and held his hand since he is incapable of being a normal teenager.", "You were asked to let him sleep there, not to be his servant. NTA.\n\nI was making my own bowls of breakfast cereal when I was 4, and started making real breakfasts for myself by the time I was 8. My mom gave me the option to make my own food if I didn't want what she was cooking, so I did it several days a week. When I got my morning paper route in 5th grade, I always made my own breakfast, because my mom wasn't up yet. This also meant that I had to get myself up. I'm also older than your aunt and uncle, and I'm male. Most of my male friends in high school also made their own breakfasts and got themselves up.\n\nYour aunt is full of shit, and has raised an incompetent child. Stop agreeing to help them out.", "NTA, if my 2 kids under 10 can make their own breakfast... she has failed as a parent."]}
