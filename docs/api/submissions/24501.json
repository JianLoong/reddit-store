The girl-talk is not my concern here because it really is fairly inevitable, and I don\u2019t think sharing intimate details with close friends is problematic if they all keep it amongst themselves and are kind. \n\nHowever, using that as a nickname is really, really uncool. I have heard people referring to a woman by the size of her breasts more times than I\u2019d care to count (sometimes that woman has been me), and it has generally been treated like it\u2019s normal and charming. \n\nIt\u2019s not okay or charming. It\u2019s mean.", "Nta. You set a boundary and she completely disrespected it. They even put a nickname on you, which makes it even worse. AND she is also dismissing your anger and saying you are overreacting. Her attitude about this sucks.\n\nBut I have to be honest, this is a weird boundary to set. I DON'T MEAN IT'S WRONG of you to feel uncomfortable about this, just that it is uncommon, as it is something I think most guys would be proud about (having a big dick).", "Don\u2019t think your the asshole but don\u2019t think you should throw ya dummy out the pram take it as a compliment be different if you had pecca", "The moment we put a man calling a girl by her parts everyone be fumming.

Wtf? She should grow up and not be comfortable with her friends making fun of her husband.", "NTA- You gave her a very firm boundary and she ignored it and worse let her group chat use that as a thing.

This is a trend with what i call the \"Sex and the City\"-Generation. Unfortunately some women like to overshare with their female friendgroup to an unhealthy degree. Sit her down and explain to her that this was an important boundary for you. That it makes you feel embarrassed to know that some people know about your private parts that aren't intimate partners you chose. Some women have a hard time to see or recognize when they humiliate a man by sharing these details. I hope you can make her see your point.", "Boundaries were broken.NTA", "NTA. I'm sure that can be flattering to some men, but it's also NOT to others. I think it was very inconsiderate that she went on to tell them about your dick, even after knowing you didn't want her to.\n\nNever understood the need to tell all your friends about your partner's genitals. \ud83e\udd23 I'm hella stingy with that info about my partner and would never want to put him in the situation you're in.

Pretty shitty. \n\nNTA.", "here's a non reddit answer for you.\n\nit's normal for her to talk about that with her friends. they're not doing it to hurt you, it's no different than a guy talking about boobs with his friends.\n\nas to referring to you as big dick, that sucks and is diminishing. I get why you're upset and she lied to you, but it is normal. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut I kind of don't believe you. Not only has every woman gossiped to her friends about your size, but it has gotten back to you every time? Wild. \n\nObviously they shouldn't be using that as a nickname for you. It's really reductive and feels like that's the most important thing about you when she's your actual wife. I'd be more concerned about the state of your relationship than about the girl talk to be honest.", "NTA I've never talked to my friends about any of my partners dick size. At most, I've said we had great sex. \n\nMore importantly, you asked her not to discuss it and she did anyway.

That is not normal male conversation. That would be super uncomfortable.\n\nEven then boobs are not equivalent to penises. You can tell how big someone\u2019s boobs are easily.

Plenty of women talk about it with their friends as a way to gossip. and plenty of men have conversations about boobs/asses/legs etc. \n\nmaybe not their wife's but I think you're lying if you're telling me you never once talked about any woman's body with your friends.", "Men do talk about women's body with their friends. Virtue signal all you want, but it does happen. Men have and do refer to women by their boobs as sometimes. \n\nI'm not advocating for it or saying that it's okay, but it happens every single day", "You're telling me that you've never had a friend or seen someone ask about how big a girl's boobs were?", "I just re-read and if she says it's only used when you do something worthy of the name, then maybe it has nothing to do with your size, and everything to do with you acting like a dick. I don't know though.", "Yea, but what they are doing is hurtful and she obviously knows that because she kept it a secret. \n\nI disagree with the plenty of men having convos about their wive\u2019s boobs or vaginas.

You don\u2019t see a distinction?", "I think you're conflating real sex talk among male friends which of course does happen all the time, and the male equivalent of this post which is not normal. Men do talk about women's bodies, but a lot more generally. Giving intimate details about their wife's vagina just wouldn't be a thing a normal man is willing to do", "Is it possible you have terrible friends and its not as common as you think. A lot of people are telling you the same thing.", "I agreed it was hurtful and wrong for her to do that.but I just provided perspective. \n\nas for you never talking about your wives body specifically with your friends, good for you I guess. but realistically that covo happens every day in every city in the world. people just talk about other people's bodies, whether it's their wife, gf, a stranger, a friend whatever. it just happens", "That would be so unusual as to be incredibly shocking. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do if someone started describing their wife\u2019s vagina lol.", "No, it is not normal to talk about the size of a woman's Vagina. It is normal for a man to talk about boobs and ass. It is normal for women to talk about penis size. Everyone is getting so hung up on specific equivalencies of penis and vaginas", "In my experience, I\u2019ve had many friends describe their bf\u2019s penis to everyone and whether it was circumcised or not. On the other end, I knew guys who would show pictures of their gf\u2019s boobs to friends. I don\u2019t think any of it is okay but it happens.", "Men talk about women's bodies.

It really is not a common topic of conversation.\n\nMaybe its more common with early twenties folks. I have the typical 30s/40s male friends who overwhelmingly talk about sport.", "Interesting. \n\nIn my experience men just don\u2019t talk about the details of their sexual partner\u2019s bodies almost at all. I\u2019ve met a few men who do but they are usually big time outliers. \n\nLike, i remember hook ups and usually the question is if the sex was good or not, and they want to know what she is like in bed. Is she active, or passive\u2026 what positions etc. No one has ever asked about boobs.\n\nLike girls in uni, i could tell you their reputation for how good they are in bed lol but i can\u2019t describe their nipples unless i saw them.\n\nFor example, i knew a girl who was nicknamed \u2018train\u2019 secretly because you could always hear when she is coming (super loud). I have no idea what her boobs or vagina look like.", "Men going into details on the bodies of sexual partners is extremely rare in my experience and men don\u2019t even ask those questions.", "You keep going back specifically to your wife. I am male and I am married. \n\nI don't believe you that you've never talked about. A woman's body with your friends in 40 years.", "Because the post was about a woman talking about her husband specifically? So, that\u2019s the comparison. \n\nI for one see a massive difference between \u2018a woman in my yoga class has a fantastic ass\u2019 and \u2018my wife has a super big vagina\u2019. Don\u2019t you?", "They weren't married when his wife told her friends that it was right when they started dating. I'm sorry, but it is completely normal for your friends to ask about your partner's body that they've never met before.\n\nIf alcohol is involved a lot of the times men will ask about boobs and women will ask about penis, it's completely normal. You can disagree with me all you want but it happens all the time. It doesn't mean that it's okay, but you're lying to yourself if you think that doesn't happen", "It happened only once right after they met but she\u2019s also fine with them calling him BD behind his back for the entirety of the relationship? It didn\u2019t happen only once. \n\nAlso, i met my wife younger than OP, and my group of friends weren\u2019t exactly the most politically correct or well educated crew, and exactly zero people asked me about my futures wife\u2019s boobs. And we had a one night stand that turned into a relationship.. so there was even less taboo about talking about it. I was basically just asked if it was good or not. I described the sex but did not go into detail on her body. That has always been the normal thing."]}
