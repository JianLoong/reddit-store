There\u2019s no reason to play the victim and make your father\u2019s death day all about her.", "NTA. What your mother did was manipulative. You are both allowed to post whatever you want on your pages. If she doesn't like it, she doesn't have to follow you.   \n\n\nAlso, who is she expecting an apology from? Just you? And an apology for what? Saying something that was probably true?    \n\n\nYour mother is leaning into respectability politics. Some people, especially older women, are averse to anything that makes people uncomfortable and think everybody should just pretend to get along all the time. Tell your mother that you're sorry that she's hurting but frankly, it has nothing to do with this public argument.", "NTA. If she was that fragile that day, she should have stayed off social media", "NTA. your mom is an adult and should know or atleast learn to handle her own emotions, you are not responsible of how she feels, ever. it is logical that the conversation you had with your brother in FB upset her but she shouldn't be expecting an apology. you're allowed to post what you want and when you want. and politics are usually a pretty sensitive topic to begin with, your mom had the choice not to look at your posts and comments any further.", "NTA. I don't think you did anything wrong. But I do think you need to consider how you want to honor your father moving forward. Is launching into a petty fight with your brother on Facebook and then defending that action the best way? You're in charge here. Figure out how you want to remember him, and then do it.", "NTA. If you see something you don't like on social media, You keep scrolling.", "No - your brother comments on your post and you are the one that shouldn't respond?", "NTA. If she was fragile, she should have taken a break from social media for a bit.", "ESH so I\u2019m going to talk about just the actions and takeout my personal opinion that Facebook political debates are pointless and it\u2019s not going to suddenly change the other persons opinion\u2026. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with you posting your own political beliefs on your facebook. Your brother was TA when he tried to start an argument on social media and you were TA for entertaining it. I get that you felt like your dad would have agreed with you however, do you think he would have cared more about the politics or more about his kids being supportive and there for their mother on such a difficult day? She should expect an apology from the both of you since you both contributed to these shenanigans.", "YTA. Unwise to start political antagonism on the anniversary of your father\u2019s death if you know your mum can see it. Doubly so if you were going out of your way to antagonise your brother, which you appear to have succeeded at.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just be patient with her because she is grieving and isn't being logical", "YTA", "Exactly!", "She did say she also said something similar to my brother. And I think she wants an apology for not letting it go.", "I was not trying to pick a fight. I was surprised he even responded to the post. I honestly did not even think of my brother when I posted it since he has literally never commented on any of my political posts before.", "She did say she was upset with him too.", " Interesting take. I did not post it to antagonize my brother. He literally never engaged with my political posts before this.", "I'm sure. But he sniped at you, and you engaged, no? You're not wrong. But decide what your values are and act in accordance with them. It's difficult not to be drawn into arguments. But in my experience in these types of situations, it's not productive."]}
