We have few male colleagues, but I choose not to be too friendly with them as they gossip about almost each and everyone and everything on earth, quite harmful ways. So I'm not comfortable to be casual with them. Also, most of us, females, are quite religious, so maintain our distances. A few days ago, one of our male colleagues wife came to pick her husband up after the duty. She is from Non-medical background and though many non-med husbands or wives of our colleagues or other doctors come to pick them,see them in a break or just come to see a doctor with their spouse's reference, it seemed like she is new to this environment of our sector, male-females working in a team. So she was downright rude to us. When we simply said hello to her, she completely ignored us. After few minutes, when we were called to receive a few patients, I and another female colleague stayed in our \"common room,\" as we received patients in the morning. So that male colleague's wife stayed with us and started asking us questions like \"how long we are working like this, so close to her husband, how can we feel good working with others husbands keeping our own husbands at home, isn't it shameful for us to even look at her husband or other women's husbands,bla bla.. she kept going on. Me and my colleague couldn't believe our own ears honestly, like is she really asking these?! Or what made her think all these within such short period of time?! We left that room and went back to work,though we were supposed to be on break then. Later that evening,when our duty is over and that male colleague was preparing to leave, his wife was waiting on the the car,we confronted him, told him about his wife's behaviour and both of us demanded apology from him and his wife or else we'll complain against him. He brushed it off, saying, ** if you choose to work with opposite gender ,you have to pay for that this way ** and tried to laugh it off. Now other male colleagues are saying , it is an innocent jealous behaviour from his wife,it's very natural, even their wives might do that and asked us to forget that.", "created_utc": 1698147620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17faqnm/aita_for_asking_a_colleague_to_keep_his_wife_away/", "score": 2061, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
