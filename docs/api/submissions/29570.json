We have few male colleagues, but I choose not to be too friendly with them as they gossip about almost each and everyone and everything on earth, quite harmful ways. So I'm not comfortable to be casual with them. Also, most of us, females, are quite religious, so maintain our distances. A few days ago, one of our male colleagues wife came to pick her husband up after the duty. She is from Non-medical background and though many non-med husbands or wives of our colleagues or other doctors come to pick them,see them in a break or just come to see a doctor with their spouse's reference, it seemed like she is new to this environment of our sector, male-females working in a team. So she was downright rude to us. When we simply said hello to her, she completely ignored us. After few minutes, when we were called to receive a few patients, I and another female colleague stayed in our \"common room,\" as we received patients in the morning. So that male colleague's wife stayed with us and started asking us questions like \"how long we are working like this, so close to her husband, how can we feel good working with others husbands keeping our own husbands at home, isn't it shameful for us to even look at her husband or other women's husbands,bla bla.. she kept going on. Me and my colleague couldn't believe our own ears honestly, like is she really asking these?! Or what made her think all these within such short period of time?! We left that room and went back to work,though we were supposed to be on break then. Later that evening,when our duty is over and that male colleague was preparing to leave, his wife was waiting on the the car,we confronted him, told him about his wife's behaviour and both of us demanded apology from him and his wife or else we'll complain against him. He brushed it off, saying, ** if you choose to work with opposite gender ,you have to pay for that this way ** and tried to laugh it off. Now other male colleagues are saying , it is an innocent jealous behaviour from his wife,it's very natural, even their wives might do that and asked us to forget that.", "created_utc": 1698147620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17faqnm/aita_for_asking_a_colleague_to_keep_his_wife_away/", "score": 1136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know this isn't an easy solution but as a woman it sounds awful where you are. Best wishes.", "Ah, Islam. The religion of peace, tranquility and still treating women like it's the 1700s", "I get it kind of. But you aren't going to get anywhere being logical and rational here. Play their own game. Either just brush them off, total ignore or portray the husband as villain, tell her next time it's so shameful for her husband to be surrounded by girls all the time, add some spice too ie he is always flirting with everyone, looks like you(wife) aren't taking good care of him at home, careful he'll slip away from you into the open arms of someone else, I feel sorry for you while you are at home your husband is being snatched up here, how can you willingly send your husband to work with so many females and all the other whacked up shit you can come up with. Enjoy the fireworks lol.", "NTA There's no need to put up with insults from others, not even in a workplace where religion or culture are common.", "No, because of the hubby's response.", "[deleted]", "If that little comment was enough you think he should be reported over it, then you're in the wrong field", "[removed]", "All of you are in the same work environment, and are not expected to take shit from family of your colleagues. Obviously he is a misogynist and will not change. Better to generate evidence, testimony now for later, worse cases.", "I would be SO tempted to say something like this.", "If they have a policy regarding the behaviour of members of the public, sure, but that would not be an HR issue.", "This is the answer", "Sure, hubby's response is bad, but this isn't purely about a boys network. This is a man effectively saying \"wives gonna wife\" XD", "Your spouse can\u2019t come and harass people you work with. Imagine it was a restaurant and she came in to eat and was harassing people. This is the same thing. You don\u2019t get a free pass for your spouse to treat your coworkers like shit, obviously.", "Actually I wrote it in a sentence just to make the post shorter, though I failed. I threatened to complain against him after his reply and laughing like AH. I lost my cool and said that. My another female colleague said the same thing as me. The whole time we tried to talk, he was smirking and sometimes laughing seeing other male colleagues pointing towards us, as if we are some kids demanding for unicorns.", "Seriously, do you think that \"if you choose to work with opposite gender ,you have to pay for that this way\" is any way an appropriate way to speak to a colleague in the workplace?", "[removed]", "[removed]", "If his wife is incapable of behaving properly, NTA should file a complaint against him. He shouldn't also respond in that manner.", "She is barred from seeing her spouse after NTA reports her for harassment.", "If an employee is allowing their spouse to hang out in a staff break room and while there they are harassing other staff, then absolutely it is an HR issue. Additionally, if a coworker, even off the clock, is saying a female staff member deserves harrassment because they chose to work in a coed position, that also is an HR issue.", "Ok", "Not at all. But it's also nowhere near serious enough to \"report\" this. It's such a small, throwaway comment. I really don't understand.", "Is that what I said??? Funny, since you were asking me if I even read the post lol", "Absolutely you have a right to feel safe in your work space and that is not a safe environment from the point of view of your mental well being. Your job is emotionally fraught anyways.  His attitude was patriarchal and when you told him what she said he should have as your colleague ensured your work environment wouldn't be made difficult by his wife who doesn't  work there.", "Some random colleague corners him as he is leaving and threatens his job unless he apologizes for something he didn\u2019t do/ is likely unaware of and you don\u2019t see any problem with that?  \n\nAnd you have the audacity to call that commenter dumb.", "I believe people have been fired due to their spouse's behavior before, too. If an employee brings in trouble, even if it's not their fault, there's a cost-benefit analysis there and sometimes it's decided they have to go. Depends a lot on employment laws though.", "If I were in HR at this place, I'd be pretty concerned by it. The colleague is effectively saying \"If you women want to work with men, you need to accept being harassed in the workplace\", and that's sending up all sorts of red flags about potential future legal trouble. But it may be that where OP is, the law doesn't properly protect against harassment in the workplace or gender discrimination, idk.", "Depends on jurisdiction and workplace, obviously, but people have been fired because their *stalkers* cause too much trouble at their workplace (such as with constant spam calls)\n\nThis asshole *should* be fired.", "How is it discrimination if they're peers though? Isn't this just another student?"]}
