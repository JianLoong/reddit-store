{"id": 9874, "submission_id": "111hf4e", "title": "AITA for not splitting my daughter's college fund", "selftext": "When my (42F) daughter (17F) was 7, we lost her father to an avoidable accident. Due to that and the subsequent settlement, my daughter was able to have a trust fund of sorts that provided for college, grad school if she wanted, and even some left over for whatever life might bring. It is money that - managed wisely - would enable her to have a head start in life. She knows about this and has never taken for granted given where the money came from. After all, we'd both rather have her father around than the money.\n\nThat said, life moves on and I remarried 6 years after my former husband's passing to a lovely man who has two children of his own (17F, 13M). All of the children live with us primarily with his children seeing their mother on vacations as she lives across the country.\n\nThis year, both our girls are graduating and should be headed to college. My daughter was admitted ED to her dream school last year and is ecstatic about it. Her father is an alumnus and she has this old sweatshirt of his that she kept to remind her of him. She cried so much when she got in and both her step father and I were proud of her because she worked hard to get in. My step daughter will also be attending a wonderful school that is one the top ranked schools for her interests. The problem now arises with the money to pay for SD's school.\n\nBecause her parents cannot afford to pay the tuition in its entirety, SD will have to take some loans. All told, she will graduate with about $40K in loans which I think is still quite modest for the school she's attending and her earning prospects post graduation. But my daughter will graduate debt free and for my husband this is suddenly a problem. He wants us to split up my daughter's fund between all three kids because then they could all (probably) have college fully paid for. My daughter won't have much left over and will definitely need to borrow for grad school - which she has expressed interest in attending - but, according to my husband, that's ok because everyone will start off on an equal footing post college. I think this is unfair to my daughter because 1) her father had to die for this money and 2) this is like her inheritance from him. My husband thinks that they are all siblings and she should be happy to share the money with them if it means giving her siblings a head start in life. I absolutely do not want to put her in the position of being guilted into saying yes if she doesn't want to. I have expressed all of this to my husband and he thinks that I'm being selfish, that I'm teaching my daughter to be selfish, and I obviously don't consider my SKs the same as my daughter.\n\nAITA for wanting to protect my daughter's trust for her as it was intended?\n\nETA: Since I've seen this a few times already, both kids do have college funds but somewhat smaller because my husband and his ex got their finances together later in life. So there is some money but with the caliber/COA of the school that SD will be attending, she will still need some loans to cover costs. I haven't brought up going to a cheaper school because that will be a fresh set of problems given where my daughter will be matriculating.", "created_utc": 1676315974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111hf4e/aita_for_not_splitting_my_daughters_college_fund/", "score": 2592, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nWhen my (42F) daughter (17F) was 7, we lost her father to an avoidable accident. Due to that and the subsequent settlement, my daughter was able to have a trust fund of sorts that provided for college, grad school if she wanted, and even some left over for whatever life might bring. It is money that - managed wisely - would enable her to have a head start in life. She knows about this and has never taken for granted given where the money came from. After all, we'd both rather have her father around than the money.\n\nThat said, life moves on and I remarried 6 years after my former husband's passing to a lovely man who has two children of his own (17F, 13M). All of the children live with us primarily with his children seeing their mother on vacations as she lives across the country.\n\nThis year, both our girls are graduating and should be headed to college. My daughter was admitted ED to her dream school last year and is ecstatic about it. Her father is an alumnus and she has this old sweatshirt of his that she kept to remind her of him. She cried so much when she got in and both her step father and I were proud of her because she worked hard to get in. My step daughter will also be attending a wonderful school that is one the top ranked schools for her interests. The problem now arises with the money to pay for SD's school. \n\nBecause her parents cannot afford to pay the tuition in its entirety, SD will have to take some loans. All told, she will graduate with about $40K in loans which I think is still quite modest for the school she's attending and her earning prospects post graduation. But my daughter will graduate debt free and for my husband this is suddenly a problem. He wants us to split up my daughter's fund between all three kids because then they could all (probably) have college fully paid for. My daughter won't have any much left over and will definitely need to borrow for grad school - which has expressed interest in attending - but, according to my husband, that's ok because everyone will start off on an equal footing post college. I think this is unfair to my daughter because 1) her father had to die for this money and 2) this is like her inheritance from him. My husband thinks that they are all siblings and she should be happy to share the money with them if it means giving her siblings a head start in life. I absolutely do not want to put her in the position of being guilted into saying yes if she doesn't want to. I have expressed all of this to my husband and he thinks that I'm being selfish, that I'm teaching my daughter to be selfish, and I obviously don't consider my SKs the same as my daughter.\n\nAITA for wanting to protect my daughter's trust for her as it was intended?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I know people always complain AITA is too quick to say \"divorce.\" It's one thing for spouse to propose this, which is already gross. He's pushing this despite getting denied, and attacking OP and OP's daughter whose father had to die to get this money.\n\nI would honestly be questioning who I really married and whether I really know this person. Does this person really care about my daughter and myself, or is he going to work to our detriment and hurt us if he thinks it helps his kids.\n\nIf he continued to push this I don't think I could stay in the relationship - for my daughter's sake at least.", "I completely agree with you.", "Any tips for finding that post?\n\nEdit: Here's a similar one:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i8kcb8/aita\\_for\\_not\\_putting\\_my\\_inheritance\\_toward\\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i8kcb8/aita_for_not_putting_my_inheritance_toward_my/)\n\nEdit: And another (this one's a tough one):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ydx2dm/wibta\\_if\\_i\\_sued\\_a\\_child\\_for\\_her\\_college\\_fund/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ydx2dm/wibta_if_i_sued_a_child_for_her_college_fund/)\n\nEdit: They just keep coming: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jk9xlf/aita\\_for\\_asking\\_my\\_daughter\\_to\\_sahre\\_her\\_college/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jk9xlf/aita_for_asking_my_daughter_to_sahre_her_college/)\n\nEdit: Aaaand another:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/lq8vo3/aita\\_for\\_not\\_giving\\_my\\_nonbiological\\_son\\_his/", "Yeah; I don't know why people never seem to get that if everyone around you starts calling you an asshole, you'd have to be a narcissist not to question yourself at least a *little*.", "Are you saying that there\u2019s a zero percent chance if her daughter found out about this being a possibility that she wouldn\u2019t resent her step dad and in return start resenting her mom?

The same thing went through my head.", "Yep. If you want things fair ya gotta make the situation the same. Don\u2019t thing he wants that once he really thinks about it. He just wants the kid\u2019s money because he didn\u2019t get his shit together soon enough to have adequate college funds. Oh well. At least his kids have a living father, even if he is selfish."]}
