{"id": 9874, "submission_id": "111hf4e", "title": "AITA for not splitting my daughter's college fund", "selftext": "When my (42F) daughter (17F) was 7, we lost her father to an avoidable accident. Due to that and the subsequent settlement, my daughter was able to have a trust fund of sorts that provided for college, grad school if she wanted, and even some left over for whatever life might bring. It is money that - managed wisely - would enable her to have a head start in life. She knows about this and has never taken for granted given where the money came from. After all, we'd both rather have her father around than the money.\n\nThat said, life moves on and I remarried 6 years after my former husband's passing to a lovely man who has two children of his own (17F, 13M). All of the children live with us primarily with his children seeing their mother on vacations as she lives across the country.\n\nThis year, both our girls are graduating and should be headed to college. My daughter was admitted ED to her dream school last year and is ecstatic about it. Her father is an alumnus and she has this old sweatshirt of his that she kept to remind her of him. She cried so much when she got in and both her step father and I were proud of her because she worked hard to get in. My step daughter will also be attending a wonderful school that is one the top ranked schools for her interests. The problem now arises with the money to pay for SD's school.\n\nBecause her parents cannot afford to pay the tuition in its entirety, SD will have to take some loans. All told, she will graduate with about $40K in loans which I think is still quite modest for the school she's attending and her earning prospects post graduation. But my daughter will graduate debt free and for my husband this is suddenly a problem. He wants us to split up my daughter's fund between all three kids because then they could all (probably) have college fully paid for. My daughter won't have much left over and will definitely need to borrow for grad school - which she has expressed interest in attending - but, according to my husband, that's ok because everyone will start off on an equal footing post college. I think this is unfair to my daughter because 1) her father had to die for this money and 2) this is like her inheritance from him. My husband thinks that they are all siblings and she should be happy to share the money with them if it means giving her siblings a head start in life. I absolutely do not want to put her in the position of being guilted into saying yes if she doesn't want to. I have expressed all of this to my husband and he thinks that I'm being selfish, that I'm teaching my daughter to be selfish, and I obviously don't consider my SKs the same as my daughter.\n\nAITA for wanting to protect my daughter's trust for her as it was intended?\n\nETA: Since I've seen this a few times already, both kids do have college funds but somewhat smaller because my husband and his ex got their finances together later in life. So there is some money but with the caliber/COA of the school that SD will be attending, she will still need some loans to cover costs. I haven't brought up going to a cheaper school because that will be a fresh set of problems given where my daughter will be matriculating.", "created_utc": 1676315974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111hf4e/aita_for_not_splitting_my_daughters_college_fund/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After all, we'd both rather have her father around than the money.\n\nThat said, life moves on and I remarried 6 years after my former husband's passing to a lovely man who has two children of his own (17F, 13M). All of the children live with us primarily with his children seeing their mother on vacations as she lives across the country.\n\nThis year, both our girls are graduating and should be headed to college. My daughter was admitted ED to her dream school last year and is ecstatic about it. Her father is an alumnus and she has this old sweatshirt of his that she kept to remind her of him. She cried so much when she got in and both her step father and I were proud of her because she worked hard to get in. My step daughter will also be attending a wonderful school that is one the top ranked schools for her interests. The problem now arises with the money to pay for SD's school. \n\nBecause her parents cannot afford to pay the tuition in its entirety, SD will have to take some loans. All told, she will graduate with about $40K in loans which I think is still quite modest for the school she's attending and her earning prospects post graduation. But my daughter will graduate debt free and for my husband this is suddenly a problem. He wants us to split up my daughter's fund between all three kids because then they could all (probably) have college fully paid for. My daughter won't have any much left over and will definitely need to borrow for grad school - which has expressed interest in attending - but, according to my husband, that's ok because everyone will start off on an equal footing post college. I think this is unfair to my daughter because 1) her father had to die for this money and 2) this is like her inheritance from him. My husband thinks that they are all siblings and she should be happy to share the money with them if it means giving her siblings a head start in life. I absolutely do not want to put her in the position of being guilted into saying yes if she doesn't want to. I have expressed all of this to my husband and he thinks that I'm being selfish, that I'm teaching my daughter to be selfish, and I obviously don't consider my SKs the same as my daughter.\n\nAITA for wanting to protect my daughter's trust for her as it was intended?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Weddings, grandchildren, holidays, vacations.. ANY AND EVERY moment that your daughter will be aching for her father whether she says and shows it or not she'll feel the void.", "No, don't do this. All it does it poison the sibling relationship with debt conversations, weird power dynamics, and the horrible prospect of someday maybe having to sue to be repaid. The daughter isn't a bank. Federal student loans already exist and have the infrastructure to ensure they're repaid over decades or in some cases forgiven. There is no reason for daughter to become Bank of Daughter.", "\\*step-daughter\n\nDaughter-in-law is the wife of your child.", "There is nothing nice about it. His kids have two parents that have had years to figure this out. Trying to guilt a child out of her money received from her DEAD parent is awful.", "If you're doing an academic degree you can expect funding, but a lot of people want a professional degree, which is generally NOT funded by the school, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's fine and normal to pay for grad school.", "\u201cIncidentally, if you have to pay for grad school, you probably shouldn\u2019t be going\u201d - this is such a silly statement. Everyone who doesn\u2019t do to grad school, law school, med school, etc. on a scholarship **shouldn\u2019t go**?", "Both my husband and I paid for things because we both have careers and didn't nickel and dime one another about who was buying what for whose kid.", "To be fair, and I mean this kindly, consider how your first husband would feel.\n\nDo you really think he would approve of his daughter sacrificing her head start in life just so her step-siblings can be on an equal footing?\n\nI hope you don\u2019t back down.\n\nYou can love your steps as much as is humanly possible, but your child comes first.\n\nDon\u2019t take away from the legacy her father left for her.\n\nNTA if you hold firm.", "Absolutely do NOT give your step kids a cent out of your daughter\u2019s college fund. It is spitting on the memory of your late husband to do so. He paid for that inheritance in blood. Your daughter would rather have two living parents and some student loans. Well your step kids have two living parents AND a bonus parent so they can deal with it or choose a cheaper program.", "She can get a job to cover the balance. As a matter of fact it may help her be more appreciative of the education she is getting if she actually has to work to achieve it. \n\nYour daughter's money belongs to her, it belonged to her before the steps joined your family and it still belongs to just her. You and your husband can and should help the other kids however you choose, without stealing your daughter's inheritance.", "When you mention trust, is this something that's even within your legal right/ability to do? Are the funds not directed to your daughter's needs alone?", "My father died in an accident when I was 5. No settlement but social security sent my adoptive parents money every month because of his death (not foster parents so no govt assistance aside from this) which they invested and I had an education fund as well.\n\nYour absolutely right that the price my dad paid for that money cannot be recouped, he's gone. But that money is mine now, and he wouldn't have wanted anyone else to have it. He worked his ass off to provide when I was little and I like to think he'd be at peace knowing that at least his death gave me a head start.\n\nThis is a hill to die on. Time to say \"no husband, and I won't be discussing it again.\"", "This is not your daughters responsibility the entitlement and selfishness of your husband is astounding. It\u2019s not that you prioritize your daughter over his the fact is as long as his kids get what he thinks they are entitled too he will throw your daughter under a bus to get! I would really rethink this relationship with this man.", "Remember, your daughter has 1 parent to give her money (you), and now they want you to give money to his kids who have 2 parents. So ask them how much they plan to support your kid yearly. Since THAT would be fair. Your daughter has 1 parent, 1 step parent, 1 dead parent. Her step siblings have 2 parents and 1 step parent.  \n\n\nIt'll never be equal for your daughter. She is always missing 1 parent to support her. Any way you look at it. This money, is to make up for what she is missing.", "2/3, he has two kids", "Oops sorry wrong placement here of comment.", "Yeah don\u2019t let her step sister or father even try to guilt her into Sharing", "This question comes up all the time and not ONCE has it ever been something other than greed and entitlement motivating the ask. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this and hope you stay strong for your daughter. NTA", "This. He needs to understand how wrong he is or he\u2019ll resent you.", "THIS RIGHT HERE! \n\nStep kids get their mother, their father, their step parents and all of that - daughter is forever missing one VIP and all she gets for a life time is some money put in an account.", "Sorry, I was thinking of academic grad work (I'm in the humanities).", "NTA. This is a sad situation that could potentially pit the kids against each other, but your daughter's inheritance is hers. Your SD can go to a different school and graduate debt-free, work part time, get grants, do a work-study program, etc etc. There are ways.", "IMO the best solution would be to reimburse your husband something for what he\u2019s paid for your daughter. Your daughters fund should have been supporting her all along. I can see your hubby being upset at this.\nNTA", "They wouldn't start on equal footing. Your step kids have 2 parents, your daughter has 1. If tragically anything happened to you your daughter would have that money and the hope your husband would still consider her family.", "Not to mention Your daughter will have to take out a loan if she wants to go to grad school. ( if you split the money between the kids) So how would this help her get a head start in life if she would need to take out a loan then?", "Agreed. Would the mother or the step children contributing to OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s college if she didn\u2019t have her own fund? Nope. Because that\u2019s not her responsibility!!!", "I truly hope not. I also hope the step dad has absolutely no access to this account. How could anyone think this is ok. To take money from op\u2019s daughter that was given to her because her father died.\n\nI hope if op lets this entitled husband talk her into doing this to her daughter I hope the daughter she\u2019s them all.", "Exactly. He doesn\u2019t want just half. He wants 2/3!!!", "Yeah I figured. No harm no foul, but I did both an academic program with funding and a professional program I had to take out loans for. I got a lot more out of the latter, and so did my colleagues.", "Seriously? You think she should pay back her husband for feeding and housing his step_daughter? Is the husband also going to reimburse OP for what she contributes for his two kids?", "Following your logic would you then also agree that the husband needs to reimburse OP for what she\u2019s paid for his children?", "Is the husband going to pay her back, because 2 kids are way more expensive then one. The step dad or his kids have no entitlement to this money!", "Then stepdad needs to repay OP for every penny she spent on his kids.", "I hope the daughter never finds this post and links it to op. It shouldn\u2019t even be a question and if I found out that my college fund that I inherited was shared or even possibly shared with my step siblings. I\u2019d have zero parents", "Very good question."]}
