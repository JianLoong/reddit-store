If the shoe was on the other foot, I don't think he would cancel an important event for me. \n\nMy mother is saying I'm not thinking right, and to keep her and grandmother's feelings into consideration, but I don't really care.

Life, ironically, doesn't stop just because someone died. Weddings, especially if you're in the USA, are notoriously expensive, so it would be an unsound decision to cancel things now.

Either way they should be happy for you and take the chance to offset the perceived bad of a death with the good of your wedding. Celebrating life is more valuable than mourning death.", "NAH.

My daughter set up a smaller memorial table for those who couldn't be there on their special day. So it included photos of my mother, aunt, the dog that had passed, a deceased member of her husband's family, and a photo of her best friends brother who died the week prior. One of the frames contained a poem, and there were flowers on that table. They are grieving, so redirecting them to assist with that table in the corner by having them select a photo and a poem will soothe them at the wedding.", "NAH. As there's money involved, it wouldn't be smart to cancel the wedding, especially not because of someone you did not like that much or other people's subjective feelings. Yet, the people who won't show up have the right to grieve for a longer time.", "NTA.\n\nGo ahead with your wedding but ask your grandmother if she would like his memory honored with a rose in the seat next to hers.\n\nTell anyone who asks \"I am certain he would have wanted the wedding to go on as scheduled, so that is what we are going to do. \"\n\n Much more elegant than saying your true feelings about him.", "If your grandfather cared about you, wouldn\u2019t he want you to have your wedding?

About 2 weeks before my wedding - we'd planned a small affair, relaxed, but very nice - my aunt died.  She was the mother of my cousin at whose house we were having the reception.  My husband to be had come from another country, and the best man and my maid of honor had taken time off work and booked flights from another country, we'd gone to a lot of trouble to get everything ready, and like you, we were just ready to get married.  I myself had to go back to work a few days after the wedding.  Canceling that wedding would have been a nightmare for everyone involved.  \n\nI genuinely loved my aunt and truly mourned her death, but her children, my cousins, were understanding.  \n\nMake sure people understand you are not disrespecting anyone, but that you are not the only involved in this wedding.", "NTA. I had a friend who grieved hard after her abusive father died. I think what she was mourning, really, was the fact that she finally knew he would never change and be a decent person and father. Have your wedding as scheduled, but be gracious to people who can\u2019t be happy for you, even if it\u2019s your mother, and even if it means she can\u2019t be there for you: \u201cMom, take care of yourself and do what you need to do, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Say that even if you don\u2019t believe it, even if it means she doesn\u2019t come.

Do not cancel your wedding! If your grandfather had been like most grandparents he would not want you to cancel your wedding because he died! The fact he wasn\u2019t a nice person makes it even more important that you don\u2019t cancel.", "NTA. But, grief doesn't have a timeline. One thing that I didn't see anyone mention is that if people are traveling for the funeral, they may not be able to afford to travel again for the wedding. (This may not be an issue, just a thought.) Even the death of someone who was an asshole can have a surprising impact on survivors, so the best I can suggest is to offer them grace. Let them know that you would love to have them there on your big day, but understand if they feel they can't be. I do like the idea of recognizing him, somehow, on your day. Not because he mattered to you, but because he mattered to people you love. It wouldn't have to take much away from your event, but would show your respect for those who are grieving.", "NTA about not wanting to cancel the wedding, you'd lose all that money you've put into it with such a last minute cancelation.  Your mom needs to look at the financial aspect of this. \n\nWith that being said, I wouldn't take to heart with the family members who don't show up. Yes, it will suck not to have everyone around however everyone will be grieving differently.  I'll use you're feelings towards him as an example. You weren't close, you're sad but it isn't hitting you quite as hard as it will others who may have been closer. \n\nIt's quite unfortunate for it to all unfold like this however, life happens and everyone involved has a different perspective on how they feel. If anyone gets upset you're not canceling your wedding, ask them if they're going to refund you all that money then.", "NTA. You likely already spent a lot of money making reservations and deposits for the weddings, and your grandfather dying is out of your control. \n\nIf some people don't attend the wedding because they are grieving, then you should respect their decision.

My cousin, the bride, was the youngest of a large family. The week was sad, but all her older siblings made sure her wedding was awesome. It was oddly one of the more fun weddings I\u2019ve been to, mostly because of the energy the family put into it. \n\nThe most important thing: there is no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that it was exactly what my uncle would have wanted.\n\nCelebrate your day!

Losing someone you had a complicated relationship with can also be tougher in a way than losing someone you just loved and are sad to lose. The anger, disappointment, sadness, etc. get all mixed up so you don\u2019t know how to feel. You\u2019re allowed to get married when you like, but your family suffered a loss and they\u2019re entitled to their feelings about that loss.
