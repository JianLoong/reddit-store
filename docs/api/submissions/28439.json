Life, ironically, doesn't stop just because someone died. Weddings, especially if you're in the USA, are notoriously expensive, so it would be an unsound decision to cancel things now.

Either way they should be happy for you and take the chance to offset the perceived bad of a death with the good of your wedding. Celebrating life is more valuable than mourning death.", "NAH.

My daughter set up a smaller memorial table for those who couldn't be there on their special day. So it included photos of my mother, aunt, the dog that had passed, a deceased member of her husband's family, and a photo of her best friends brother who died the week prior. One of the frames contained a poem, and there were flowers on that table. They are grieving, so redirecting them to assist with that table in the corner by having them select a photo and a poem will soothe them at the wedding.", "NAH. As there's money involved, it wouldn't be smart to cancel the wedding, especially not because of someone you did not like that much or other people's subjective feelings. Yet, the people who won't show up have the right to grieve for a longer time.", "NTA.\n\nGo ahead with your wedding but ask your grandmother if she would like his memory honored with a rose in the seat next to hers.\n\nTell anyone who asks \"I am certain he would have wanted the wedding to go on as scheduled, so that is what we are going to do. \"\n\n Much more elegant than saying your true feelings about him.", "If your grandfather cared about you, wouldn\u2019t he want you to have your wedding?

About 2 weeks before my wedding - we'd planned a small affair, relaxed, but very nice - my aunt died.  She was the mother of my cousin at whose house we were having the reception.  My husband to be had come from another country, and the best man and my maid of honor had taken time off work and booked flights from another country, we'd gone to a lot of trouble to get everything ready, and like you, we were just ready to get married.  I myself had to go back to work a few days after the wedding.  Canceling that wedding would have been a nightmare for everyone involved.  \n\nI genuinely loved my aunt and truly mourned her death, but her children, my cousins, were understanding.  \n\nMake sure people understand you are not disrespecting anyone, but that you are not the only involved in this wedding.", "NTA. I had a friend who grieved hard after her abusive father died. I think what she was mourning, really, was the fact that she finally knew he would never change and be a decent person and father. Have your wedding as scheduled, but be gracious to people who can\u2019t be happy for you, even if it\u2019s your mother, and even if it means she can\u2019t be there for you: \u201cMom, take care of yourself and do what you need to do, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Say that even if you don\u2019t believe it, even if it means she doesn\u2019t come.

Do not cancel your wedding! If your grandfather had been like most grandparents he would not want you to cancel your wedding because he died! The fact he wasn\u2019t a nice person makes it even more important that you don\u2019t cancel.", "NTA. But, grief doesn't have a timeline. One thing that I didn't see anyone mention is that if people are traveling for the funeral, they may not be able to afford to travel again for the wedding. (This may not be an issue, just a thought.) Even the death of someone who was an asshole can have a surprising impact on survivors, so the best I can suggest is to offer them grace. Let them know that you would love to have them there on your big day, but understand if they feel they can't be. I do like the idea of recognizing him, somehow, on your day. Not because he mattered to you, but because he mattered to people you love. It wouldn't have to take much away from your event, but would show your respect for those who are grieving.", "NTA about not wanting to cancel the wedding, you'd lose all that money you've put into it with such a last minute cancelation.  Your mom needs to look at the financial aspect of this. \n\nWith that being said, I wouldn't take to heart with the family members who don't show up. Yes, it will suck not to have everyone around however everyone will be grieving differently.  I'll use you're feelings towards him as an example. You weren't close, you're sad but it isn't hitting you quite as hard as it will others who may have been closer. \n\nIt's quite unfortunate for it to all unfold like this however, life happens and everyone involved has a different perspective on how they feel. If anyone gets upset you're not canceling your wedding, ask them if they're going to refund you all that money then.", "NTA. You likely already spent a lot of money making reservations and deposits for the weddings, and your grandfather dying is out of your control. \n\nIf some people don't attend the wedding because they are grieving, then you should respect their decision.

My cousin, the bride, was the youngest of a large family. The week was sad, but all her older siblings made sure her wedding was awesome. It was oddly one of the more fun weddings I\u2019ve been to, mostly because of the energy the family put into it. \n\nThe most important thing: there is no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that it was exactly what my uncle would have wanted.\n\nCelebrate your day!

Losing someone you had a complicated relationship with can also be tougher in a way than losing someone you just loved and are sad to lose. The anger, disappointment, sadness, etc. get all mixed up so you don\u2019t know how to feel. You\u2019re allowed to get married when you like, but your family suffered a loss and they\u2019re entitled to their feelings about that loss.

Death is a part of life and you need to keep living it. Celebrate your day with those who want to celebrate you and your soon-to-be-husband. Congratulations!", "No, you\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s actually quite convenient - if folks are coming from out of town for the funeral, they can just hang around for a few days and go to the wedding too!  It\u2019s probably cheaper than two trips. \n\nEnjoy your special day.", "NTA my grandfather who I loved and cherished died about 2.5 weeks before our wedding. Funeral was interstate so I couldn\u2019t attend due to time already set to be off for the wedding and no extra funds to attend. One uncle didn\u2019t attend my wedding. My grandfather would have wanted it to go ahead. Life is short - celebrate love while you can.", "NTA. And it has nothing to do with anyone\u2019s feelings towards grandpa. It\u2019s just too impossible to reschedule a wedding. \n\nSimilar thing happened in my family - we buried Dad on a Wednesday and by sibling went forward with a graduation party for their kid on Saturday. That\u2019s life, Dad would have wanted us all to go forward. Maybe remind them of that.\n\nEnjoy your special day.", "NTA. Tell everyone you understand if they don\u2019t attend and you won\u2019t press anyone to do so. However you will not tolerate being pressed to change the date because that will not be happening. So either come, or gracefully decline.", "NTA. I know people whose parents and siblings have died the day before and the wedding went in as planned. If you change it, you\u2019ll always remember it as something that you had to change because of a death.", "NTA, It's not like you planned your wedding around his death on purpose, so unless they are willing to pay for you to reschedule your wedding, you have no obligation to do anything that they want you to do. Honestly, you still don't even if they do pay for it.", "We just had this in my family. No one thought to cancel the wedding, that\u2019s a year of planning, so much money, so much build up. \n\nWas the timing great? No. We can\u2019t help that though. We were in mourning, so in our culture the close family do not dance, but 80-90% of the wedding guests didn\u2019t have that relationship and they had a gorgeous day. We were happy for the distraction. It helped to tell the couple how much our family member was looking forward to it and how happy she would\u2019ve been to be there. We all knew as she was the first to RSVP, had a dress, and that helped us there, we felt her with us. \n\nI\u2019d just tell them they are welcome to come, but you understand if they\u2019re not able to. I hope you have an absolutely beautiful day, OP!", "Yes. Have your wedding and since he was an asshole, raise a glass and say \u201cI know this is what he would have wanted\u201d. Cheers to your marriage!", "Happened in our family too.  Grandparent died 7 days before the wedding.  Family was there in full celebration of the happy event.", "Often, older family members look forward to celebrations. They always comment on how it's such a bummer that everyone comes together for a funeral, when they'd rather have a reunion.\n\n(Gosh, and it's already been planned for months!)", "There are definitely those who think death wipes clean an asshole personality or whatever other wrongdoings of that person.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t and I wish more people would be remembered as they were in life. It would be better for the mental health and emotional healing of the people who suffered their behaviours.", "In fact, he\u2019s having his day on Wednesday.", "Dead Asshole Day should be a federal holiday.", "r/InLieuOfFlowers might be an interesting sub for you to peruse", "But if they did cancel, when would be an appropriate amount of time before they rescheduled? A month? Six months? A year? Any amount of time could be seen as having forgotten the dead and being insensitive to family members who are still grieving.", "OP also has that same amount of time to \"process the death of someone close to them\", plus a wedding that's already planned.", "Those who don\u2019t come aren\u2019t very considerate family/friends.", "I love that. At my wedding we also had a memorial candle that we lit during the ceremony.", "Yeah, NAH.\n\nEven if OP did love him, that's alot of money to throw down the drain.  They need to go ahead, but have to understand that some of her Grandfather's family members might be a bit muted, so the wedding isn't going to be quite what she imagined it would.  Mom might not exactly be dancing on the tables, and it might be all Grandma can muster to actually go to and get through the actual ceremony only a week after her husband's death and a few days after she buried or cremated him.  I get they're bummed that the timing means they're not really going to be able to enjoy things, but they realistically have to understand that it's too much money to lose.", "Yes, the death of a person you have had a bad and/or abusive relationship can still hit hard. People can still love people who hurt them and, as you say, grieve the loss of any chance of change or reconciliation. If the relationship is decades and decades long, like with OP\u2019s grandmother and mother, there\u2019s also the shock of the practical changes in every day life - even if the death was expected. \n\nI\u2019m surprised how many people are calling grandma and mom AHs for grieving because grandpa was an awful person - as if that automatically makes it easier or means their grief isn\u2019t legitimate. \n\nThere are NAH here, as long as OP can accept that what things aren\u2019t as straightforward for her mom and grandma. Hopefully they\u2019ll be able to come together for the wedding and celebrate a joyous occasion - but if the don\u2019t feel able to attend, either in part or in full, then that\u2019s also understandable. Even if grandpa was an awful person.", "It isn\u2019t really, though.  G\u2019Pa was an AH even in death.  That event has nothing to do with the wedding.  Everyone needs to compose themselves, get a pocket pack of Kleenex, and celebrate the life events that we should be focused on.", "Then shouldn\u2019t your judgement be NAH?", "If OP ends up with lots of extra food due to cancellations, maybe see if there is some way to donate the food? It might make them feel better about the smaller financial hit of payign for guests who don't show up but not lose all the money by postponing the wedding.", "This. This is the way.", "This is the approach I would take. \u201cGrandpa was so happy for me that I was marrying fianc\u00e9.  I know he wouldn\u2019t want me to postpone the wedding\u201d.  Maybe make a memorial seat at the wedding/reception.", "My grandma was in hospice and died 7 days after the wedding. My mom had been upset throughout the planning that I hadn't had my SIL as a bridesmaid but instead as my personal attendant. But it was such a good thing that I had her in that position since she was clear headed and helped make things happen when my mom was grieving the inevitable with her mom.", "So much this. My FIL was a GIGANTIC a-hole to my MIL and husband growing up. He died back in \u201805 and immediately he turned into a saint. I don\u2019t dare say a bad word about him for fear of starting a huge fight.", "I never understood why dead people were immediately afforded sainthood. Their AH behaviors in life are still AH behaviors, so they died AH's.", "NTA. There's a book in the Ender's Game series (by Orson Scott Card) called Speaker of the Dead. A Speaker will investigate and eulogize someone who has passed away but they don't sugar coat anything, for better or worse they give an accurate depiction of the person's life. And I've always thought that was a beautiful idea. None of us are ever purely good or bad in life. I think it's important for us to be able to acknowledge that in death as well.", "Dude, right?? The second some asshole dies, they immediately gets angel hood.  It's insane to me. Maybe people think their ghost will come haunt them if they mention how awful they were when they were living. \ud83d\ude44", "Yup. My family always says \u201cdon\u2019t speak ill about the dead,\u201d but why? My grandfather was a prick. I hadn\u2019t talked to him in 15 years when he died. He was a shitty person and father. I usually call him my dads father because I don\u2019t even want to remember we were related \ud83d\ude02", "Having  lost three family members this year, I would say if someone can't handle going to a wedding due to grief, give them their space and get on with your wedding. Don't sit around nit picking on what \"a good amount of time\" is.", "OP has said on record that they were not, in fact, close to their grandfather.  Regardless of how OP feels about her grandfather, her grandmother lost her husband.  It's worlds different.  The least OP can do is be understanding that other people cared about this man, even if she herself doesn't.", "I'd say OP is not very considerate of their grief either.\n\nIf everybody were acting like grown ups, what would happen would be : OP holds her wedding like intended; those who can come do, those who can't don't. The end. No need to guilt trip anybody into cancelling the wedding. No need to feel hurt because some people are too stricken with grief to come.", "even if he was an AH to OP, the rest of the family is still entitled to grieve. Grief isnt something you can just sweep under the rug", "She is not an AH for not wanting to cancel her wedding. I think there is an AH element in that some of the family are insisting on her cancelling the wedding, but I don't believe people in mourning politely declining due to the death are AHs.", "Omg this is delicious. What's he gonna do?! Stop her lol", "Great series, btw!", "Of course OP should be understanding, but that doesn't mean cancelling the wedding as if it's no big deal to do. OP is not wrong or heartless for not doing so.\n\nYou also assume OP feels nothing about the death, which is not what OP said. I meant close to them as in their grandfather, not that they had a close relationship.", "My thoughts exactly", "The funeral is happening before the wedding. They get their closure and get to move on to a bright new beginning.  People really need to do more to strengthen themselves.", "They want to cancel a wedding for this, and are pitching a fit about it.  You cannot be serious.  Are they going to foot the bill for the new wedding.  \n\nPeople need to get over themselves.  This guy was likely ancient.  This wasn\u2019t a shock. Deal.  \ud83d\ude44", "1.  I am not calling them wrong or heartless, NOR am I advocating for them to cancel.  I am saying it would be heartless of OP to not understand that people may not attend in their grief.  Asking their elderly grandmother to attend a wedding days after burying her husband is too much to ask, full stop.  Asking anyone that is too much.  \n\n2.  OP said they were done grieving and their grandfather was an asshole they didn't like.  Whose words am I twisting here?", "Her grandfather will have been dead for something like ten days when she gets married, if my math is right.  Expecting someone to \u201cmove on to a bright new beginning\u201d 10 days after losing a parent or spouse is unreasonable. If someone can do it, that\u2019s fine, but no one is wrong for taking longer than that to grieve.", "You have a good point about being understanding, my point was that it's a little icky to assume OP wouldn't be understanding or felt nothing. Hopefully that makes more sense", "Didn\u2019t say the grief ends. I just think it\u2019s insane anyone would forgo or recommend the wedding be canceled over this. People need to get a grip."]}
