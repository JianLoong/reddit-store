We had our first child at 20, and my husband was unable to follow through with his plans of going to law school. He studied engineering, and at the time had a job offer at Raytheon since he was going to graduate that year. He of course took the being he was going to be a father. \n\nHe has never liked his job, his dream was always to be a lawyer. Remember his family telling me that is all he has ever wanted to be since he was a kid. I understand this is his dream, but he has a family now and unfortunately, we have to think about the bigger picture. \n\nWe have spoken about this at length, my husband is smart but even he doubts he could maintain working and going back to school, especially with the workload of law school. Also factoring in cost he wants to go to a top 10 school, and based on his LSAT score it is possible, but will cost us. \n\nNo matter how I try to look at this it seems like a stupid move. I get it this is his passion his office has more law-related books than anything else. I know he could do it and be happy, but even his friend who has a law degree has told him variance for pay is insane. Especially in the field he wants to practice. He wants to practice special needs/education law. He told me the details but it went over my head. \n\nAfter months of talking, I told him I would divorce him if he went through with this. He cannot jeopardize our family's future and well-being because he hates how his life has turned out. Not everyone gets to live the ideal of following their passion. \n\nAfter all of this, my husband told me I was being selfish, especially since he paid for me to finish my degree, and used the fact that I was able to get a degree in a field I enjoy against me. I understand it is not fair but facts are facts I cannot sustain our household on my income. He was able to sustain our household on his income. I technically do not have to work which provided me the luxury to earn a degree based on my interests and not income-driven\n \nWhat he does not understand even if I did want to go down the path of a high-earning job, I understand my limits and capabilities. I do not have the mind to deal with what my husband did in school, especially in his case since he graduated two years before our friends.\n\nMy husband has me I am manipulating him because if we divorce he will be forced to stay working. What he does not get is our focus is on our child, if he has money to pay for a top education for himself that money should go toward our child. He had his chance, our duty is to make sure our kid has the best possible chance.", "created_utc": 1694476953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gbwpf/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_quit_his_well/", "score": 862, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It makes no sense for him to leave high-paying to pursue his dream at this stage in his life. We need to focus on our kid and what is best for him.\n\nI understand how what I am saying is cold, but this is reality. That being said he called me selfish and used the fact of him paying for my education against me to make me feel a certain type of way. Made me think I was in the wrong but I know this cannot work with his current job,  and I cannot sustain our house on my income. Also not willing to downsize we live in a great area, with awesome schools and our son's friends are all here.

You are living an expensive and luxurious life, financed by your husband's misery and you aren't willing to give any of it up. The truth is, you could both live just fine, as well as save for a comfortable retirement, you just won't be able to live like you're making 400k per year.\n\n/edit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy goodness.

He would in fact be *getting* a future.\n\nYou frankly sound absolutely heartless.\n\nYour kid is 15... why not tell him just hold out another couple years and then go for it?\n\nYTA", "YTA  \n\n\nDude, I hate to break it to you, but you are definitely the asshole here. Your husband's got a lifelong dream to become a lawyer, and you're shutting it down because of money? That's a bit harsh.  \n\n\nI get it, finances are a big deal, especially with a kid in the picture. But think about it \u2013 he supported you while you finished your degree, so why not show him the same support now? Life's too short to kill someone's dream.  \n\n\nYou could've tried talking, finding some middle ground, or maybe looked into scholarships or part-time work. Threatening divorce seems like a nuclear option. Bottom line, it's all about compromise and having each other's backs.", "YTA. \n\nYour child is 15 and nearly an adult. You had him at 20, which means your husband is only 35 years old. And you think expecting him to be miserable for the rest of his life is a fair request? Are you delusional or just selfish?\n\nYour child will be 18 in 3 years. So yes, while you\u2019re technically correct in that you have a family, your child is almost an adult who will be starting their own life. \n\nI hope your husband sees this for what it is - that you don\u2019t truly care about his wants and that you\u2019re not at all supportive of you. I hope he then takes the initiative to divorce your ass.", "I don't agree. It sounds like he already paid for both his own education and yours. Why can't your child shoulder at least some of the cost of their own education too? You only \"technically\" don't have to work because he is working, at a job he hates, but you are equally responsible for supporting your family. Maybe you should try for a better paying job? \n\nThe way you say he had his chance implies he actually did have a choice, but at the time he put you and the coming baby first. You want him to put others first until his life is over? \n\nSurely there is some compromise options: some kind of leave/less hours from work, a slower timeline for law school, you getting a 2nd job or earning more, and so on. Keep talking. \n\nYTA for just dismissing him out of hand.", "YTA.  So you have a job that you enjoy and he supported you while you earned your degree to get this job you enjoy , so he wants the same deal from you and you tell him to pound sand.  I hope he divorces you and you have to live on the salary you get from the job you enjoy.", "YTA\n\nAnd I'd be filling out the divorce papers. There's no way I'd put up with some asshole who thinks the best way to deal with a disagreement is to threaten divorce. And if it works once you'll just keep using it as a threat. That's the way women like you operate.\n\nIt's like you got yours so fuck him right? You *do* come off as selfish and self centered.", "Op you are a fucking horrible wife", "YTA. \n\nMy husband approached me a decade into our marriage to ask if I would be ok if he took almost a $40,000 in pay cut to pursue his dream job. We crunched the numbers and saw that while we won\u2019t be able to save as much or give our kids a sizable college fund (I wouldn\u2019t be able to work a whole lot of hours being the main caregiver for the kids), it could be done. We have always been pretty frugal, living below our means and I wanted him to pursue his dream for once. And once the kids are all in school, I can also go full time. \n\nHe has been supporting us well for years. He deserves to go for the job he will really enjoy.", "OH yeah  YTA. You are entirely over entitled and not even trying to get of your lazy ass and help out. Technically you do have to work. The fact that you decided you prioritise your happyness over not only him but your sons future by wasting the opportunities other people bought you is disgusting. And hiding behind your \"limited\" abilities is a complete cop out. Each industry has their own skill set requirments and they all pay well at certain levels. \n\nYou cannot claim \"he had his chance\" when the reason he no longer has that chance because you decided it was okay to waste yours regardless of what it mean for him or your son. \n\nI mean which one of you had the bright Idea to have a kid before he finished his education", "YTA- He supported you and the child you share together, working a job he dislikes, and helped support you for your dream degree. And you can't give him that same support. It's been his lifelong dream to be a lawyer. I get finances are an issue, but life is short. And the fact you are threatening divorce, is a manipulation tactic. He is completely right that if you divorce him, he's gonna have to work at the same job he hates. You're being manipulative, dismissing and selfish. He deserves this chance and you're ruining it.", "YTA\n\nSo you had a child at 20, kid's now 15.  That puts him at what? 35-ish? He still has a good 30 years working, if not more.  Is it stupid to want to like what he does every day? Can your child not take student loans like the general population? Is it not possible to help your child to pay back the student loans AFTER your husband gets a job that he likes?\n\nJust because of him switching careers doesn't mean your child can't grow.  I don't understand why this is an either-or situation and why can't you change your lifestyles to accommodate him.", "I will say only this. A person gets one life, and it isn't that long. A finite amount of time to fulfill all their dreams, desires, and plans. Nothing is more important than being able to live a fulfilling life.\n\nAnd at the end, no one lays on their deathbed wishing they had spent more time at work.", "\"He had his chance.\" When? When he went to work in a job he hated and put his professional goals on hold, or when he was making sure you could get your degree? Nope, neither of those times.\nLook, yes, this might be impossible. But YTA 100% for threatening him with divorce over this--that's really fucked up and incredibly selfish. If you cared about him at all, or had any appreciation for what he's done for the family, you'd approach this differently. But it sounds like you don't.", "Info:  With your degree.....could you get a higher paying job if you tried?", "YTA get a better paying job if it is truly about your kid you should be working a higher paying job you hate.", "OP this was the hill you died on, whether you knew it or not.  You gave him the ultimatum and he will likely call you on it one day when you're least expecting it, so don't be surprised.  He did what was expected of him, but he'll stop being miserable and realize his happiness is more important than his family's.  Good luck.", "YTA He put his dreams on hold for your dreams and family. It's his turn. Find a compromise.", "Info: Does your job not support your lifestyle or doesn't make enough to pay bills? Like, if my husband wasn't working, my family could not afford to exist, period. My income would never be enough to support us. On the flip side, if I were not working, we would just need to downsize and make sacrifices we would really rather not make.", "You could earn more and you could cut out some luxuries- you just care more about living a rich life than you do about your husband's dreams and feelings. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You're perfectly fine with him supporting you going after your dream career and degree, but not the other way around? Your child is also 15yo already. And to jump right to threatening divorce? Well, you might have brought it up but now I'm thinking it's not the worst idea for your husband to take you up on.", "YTA -- but I think you already know that.  You can step up and pull your weight for 3 years while he gets his JD-- or you can divorce him and scramble to support yourself on the alimony the judge awards based on your husband being a full time student.", "\"He had his chance\"\n\nWhen, exactly?  Cause it doesn't sound like he did\n\nIt sounds like YTA\n\nThreatening divorce over this is extreme\n\nMaybe compromise and he can go to law school in 3 years when your kid is in college? And you can go back to work at that point too?\n\nThis seems solvable and not by \"do what i say or else\"", "YTA.\n\nSounds like your husband is the one doing all the sacrificing in the relationship while you reap the rewards. It's always easy to send others to pay, now it's your turn to sacrifice (get a higher paying job, second job, etc) and let your husband dream.", "YTA. In essence, you want to stop your husband from pursuing his dream because you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll have to compromise your preferred lifestyle or have to work more yourself to maintain it. I can think of few things that sound more privileged and entitled\u2014especially given your husband\u2019s salary as a lawyer would still be sufficient to keep you financially comfortable in the ordinary understanding.", "Threatening a divorce is manipulation. Do you think having unhappy husband, makes a happy marriage? Honestly, you should get divorce. Once you start threatening a divorce, your marriage is over. There\u2019s no way for you come back from that, you\u2019ve said words and you can\u2019t take it back. He\u2019s not going to look at you same.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nHonestly you sound like you hate him... \n\nI thought you were going to say he wanted to go to culinary school or something. \n\nAnyhow he should just let you divorce him. Go to school anyhow. He's only 35. A few hard years but then he can start over and hopefully meet a woman who actually loves him.", "YTA\n\nHis happiness also matters to your family's wellbeing.", "YTA. What's you plan if he calls your bluff? \n\nHe's miserable at work, which usually carries over to home life. Why do you want him to continue to be miserable, for the extra $$?\n\nAlso, just because he says he likes one area of law now doesn't mean he'd end up practicing it. And a specialized field like special needs ed could end up being lucrative, since that's all you seem to really be interested in.", "I forget where in the marriage vows it says \u201cI won\u2019t love you if poor\u2026\u201d can you remind me? At least that want in my vows\n\nYTA", "YTA. Who are you to tell him that he can't fulfill his dream of being a lawyer. Maybe it's time you step up, and help him like he helped you get your degree.

Why don't you propose to him that he works until your son/daughter leaves and then he goes back to school?", "First off YTA as many people have pointed out.\n\nHowever. Maybe this is a good thing that you two get a divorce? If you got married at 20, then you both probably weren't fully becoming the people you were going to become. And if he's SO FAR beyond your mental acuity as you have pointed out. He'd probably be happier with someone that is on his mental level. The way you are only seeing this from your wants/needs, and rationalizing it with \"well this is what must be done\" would point to a rather limited intellect/sense of self. \n\nIf you get a divorce. You'll certainly get the $$$ from your husband that you want and he'll find a partner that is better suited for him, and probably be happier.", "YTA", "YTA who does not seem to give a crap about your husband\u2019s happiness.

It's also quite possible that the judge overseeing their case, who's a lawyer himself/herself, loves the legal profession and would be sympathetic to OP's husband.

So she's gambling that her husband will be forced to keep working in a profession he dislikes if she divorces him, but that's not at all guaranteed. Right now OP is setting herself up for a divorce no matter what, because if her husband is resentful of her intransigence he's likely to divorce her anyway when their child turns 18 and heads off to college.
