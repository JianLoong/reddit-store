Real names changed for privacy purposes.\n\nI've had a friend, Clara and we've been close since we met. She is struggling with some mental health issues and I've always been there for her and helped her out where i can. We also share a lot of our personal lives and stories with each other.\n\nEarly last year I met a guy, let's call him Brad. Brad was quite alright, and we hit it off as we had a few common topics we shared. Making new friends was always a good thing, and i wanted to introduce him into my circle of friends too. \n\nUnfortunately, Brad and Clara got into an extremely heated argument. It was something completely dumb (to me) - something about whether a gun would defend you if the attacker had a knife or sword but had the element of surprise. It escalated so badly that they were calling each other terrible names, and i was shocked since I had never seen either of them act this way before. They parted on extremely bad terms despite my best attempt at brokering the peace. \n\nOver the next couple of days i tried to talk to Clara and get them to make up, but she was adamant about the situation being final and even gave me an ultimatum. Either i break off all contact with him or she will break off contact with me. I gave her another two days to cool off but there was no change. I valued her (and knew her longer) so i reluctantly chose her. I was candid with Brad, explained the situation and that I had nothing against him. \n\nClara disappeared a few weeks later. She does this often when her mental state worsens, and shuts herself in for some time. I sent her a few messages to check on her well being but didn't get a reply. This time was much longer than previously but i thought nothing of it, having given her the option to come back whenever she was ready.\n\nTwo weeks ago she returned after several months, and announced her engagement to Brad, then invited me to her wedding. After getting over my shock, i asked why they were together. She said he was there for her when he went through a tough time and he was her world. \n\nI turned down her invitation and said i would not like to attend. She got upset and said that i should put my differences with him aside. I said i had no differences with him, it was her i had an issue with. She told me to cut him out then went and got engaged with him? I feel like i was made to be the fool. \n\nSince then her friends have been hounding me, saying i should get over myself, stop being jealous, and that i was never in a relationship with Brad in the first place. I feel like this isn't about Brad at all, but everyone seems to disagree.

You should have never agreed to the ultimatum. And now, you aren\u2019t even close enough friends to have known that she was dating someone seriously enough to be engaged.

Absolutely NTA \n\nI wonder if Clara refrained from contacting you earlier because deep down she knew it would make her look really dumb. Since she ended up dating the guy she told you to cut off.

She\u2019s full of shit and SHE is the AH not you.", "Clarify with your \"friends\" what really happened, if you want then block them all.  No matter the feelings or non feelings between you, and Brad, Clair saw you as competion for what she wanted so she gave you the ultimatim to get you out of the way.  I have no doubt that if you talked to Brad you would find out that she has been feeding him a pack of lies about you to ensure no contact between you two.  I would further guess she's done the same with all of his friends, especially any women.  You don't need that kind of toxic in your life.  I would feel bad for Brad if he wasn't fool enough to fall for that crap.  If the marriage lasts he'll be her little whipping boy for life.\n\nAs far as Clair being angry at you for not attending.  She's only mad because she can't rub it in your face that she \"won\" the game only she knew she was playing.  She is now pulljng friends in to get mad at you because her little game to hurt or get a heartbroken for losing Brad reaction out of you, so she needs validation, and to extend the game only she is playing.

Clara sounds like she was in a really fragile mental place and this is very spur of the moment. I fear their relationship may not last long. If she went so nuclear as to make you choose between her or him for one argument I'd already be on the fence about continuing to associate with her, but this? Damn.\n\nSide note, I know it's politics and things can get heated, but that argument literally sounds like some funny DnD type argument that I'd hear podcasters losing their shit over.
