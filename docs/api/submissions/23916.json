I\u2019m waiting for my mom to wake up", "She mentioned how one of her exes did end up spreading certain images. I don\u2019t know why she would do this again. I truly feel sick to my stomach.\n\nI will post an update when I talk to my mom", "I will post another update when I talk to my mother", "I\u2019m going to take suggestions from the replies here and talk to my mom about getting her into therapy. I will take myself out/pay for myself if I have to. This is no longer an option for them, it\u2019s a need", "From about 4th to 7th grade she \u201cdated\u201d a bunch of people because that\u2019s what was cool and trendy at the time. She had a new boyfriend almost every week. They never really went on dates, just sat with each other at lunch and that\u2019s it. Perhaps it\u2019s on my parents for excusing that behavior as childish, but she and my parents say they don\u2019t really count", "I didn\u2019t even think about what this could do to my dad if this is discovered. Thank you for opening my eyes to that", "Are your parents aware of it? Don't they find it concerning in any way?", "Yes! She's 12, she'll forget about it in a few weeks and move onto something else.", "Have you guys thought of therapy for her (or the fam, if applicable?) To try to understand the behaviour, which is totally not normal for a 12 year old (unless I am too old and it's the norm now)?", "[deleted]", "One thing I will say is that because she\u2019s so young, becoming Uber strict may not work. If she was like 16, they\u2019d only need to do it for a few years before she gained more sense. But she\u2019s 12. You can\u2019t be super strict for 8 years without just teaching your kid to be a liar. \n\nThey need to find a way to explore where this need for attention is coming from and how to manage it. You need to be having conversations about how she sees herself and who she wants to be. I think things that help her self esteem and keep her busy, like volunteering and sports, could really help.", "Is there a way your parents could \"accidentally discover\" that she's sending these photos?", "YIKES. Cheating, dating that many guys, and sending nudes to them? At 12?!? Your parents need to fix this IMMEDIATELY and you definitely need to tell them about it. That\u2019s really fucked up.", "Wow.", "Do you think there\u2019s been prior? I don\u2019t think this normal behaviour for a 12 year old. She told her brother the boy is 14 im worried is some old sleazy man.", "So if you trust your parents not to say anything and you feel comfortable with it then try drop hints about your dad needing to check his laptop and change password. If the hints don't work then you might need to outright tell them what's going on and ask them not to say that you told them.  \nBut either way she's young and believes she's old enough to make her own decisions, the net isn't the safest place especially for younger ones wo think they know better.  \n\n\nEither way you're a damn good big bro trying to watch out for her.", "Oh she\u2019s definitely not! Is she earning her own living? Taking care of food, laundry, house? Paying for her internet, phone and computer? So she absolutely is NOT old enough to make decisions that even adults can get in trouble for.", "What are her friends at school like, my offsider\u2019s daughter is the same age and in the same phase but it stems from her friend who has a lot more freedom then a 12 year old should", "Is that a conversation you feel comfortable having with her?", "Tell the parents tbh my dude. Tell her you're telling them, that you love and care about her. She'll be mad for ages but thank you later in life for sure.", "Then break your promise. She seems like she wants to be validated sexually and at her age that is very dangerous. You should protect your sister. And get her into therapy.", "How old is this boy", "Of course it's lying. You're just excusing it.\n\nAnd if you don't care, why did you even post here?", "That's the trick, open up the browser history and just leave it open when you know your dad is going to use it next, she won't know how he found out and honestly you should make sure he does find out, she's 12 and her safety is more important than her liking you, she'll thank you when she's older.", "It might be worth looking into the legities of this a bit more too. Where I live it is illegal to have intimate images of anyone under 18 even if the person who has the images is under 18 themselves. Young boys can end up on the sex offenders register for this.", "Thank you. Good luck. That is not going to be an easy convo.", "I mean kids play with dating at different ages but 4th grade seems rather young, and that she still refers to these guys as exes feels a bit more mature than I\u2019d expect. You did the right thing though.", "They say most of them don\u2019t count since they weren\u2019t really \u201cdating\u201d (they only saw each other at school and dated for only about a week) but it\u2019s grown more concerning over the years and they have acknowledged this", "The boy is apparently 14 he\u2019s trying to get there if he hasn\u2019t already", "We\u2019ve thought of therapy, but our insurance is so picky with what they will cover that it\u2019s hard finding a place. I\u2019m afraid that this is becoming the norm. Just some of the things I see marketed towards children now makes me sick to my stomach", "Bad influences, inappropriate media, unrestricted media access\u2026there\u2019s so many things it could be", "I\u2019m going to bring those points up to my mom as many other replies have suggested the same. I\u2019m also going to suggest therapy", "Most of them aren\u2019t the greatest people, and one of her friends is VERY sexual at the age of 13. I wonder if that has any influence? I don\u2019t know anymore", "She wouldn\u2019t tell me. She doesn\u2019t tell me much of anything anymore", "From my understanding, 14. I believe he is a freshman this year like her boyfriend is", "Then I suppose I\u2019m excusing it\n\nIf you read the update, I explained how I felt like an asshole for considering breaking the promise without any proof. Now with definitive proof, I don\u2019t feel like an asshole. I feel like a big brother who is protecting his sister, and I don\u2019t care who thinks I\u2019m an asshole at this point. I just can\u2019t take the post down without breaking the rules", "It\u2019s illegal where I am too", "No it is not\u2026it wasn\u2019t when I found out the first time. I\u2019m trying to script it out so I don\u2019t utterly crash when the time comes, but of course, I may crash anyways", "So it sounds. You're doing the right thing telling your parents. :)", "You are conflating two issues: her current behavior and the \"exes\". I agree with your parents that those relationships don't really count if dating in that context means just seeing each other at school, sitting together at lunch etc. That's well within the limits of age appropriate behavior. The current issues, however, are not, and should not be confused with her previous \"dating\" life.", "What are you seeing?", "This is far too big to keep to yourself. She hasn't told you any secrets so you're not betraying her trust. Talk to your parents, or a trusted adult.", "You're a dishonest person bathing in warm lies. Breaking promises, loving lies and hating truth. Clearly and 100% YTA. Better yourself.", "Of course you will. You between a rock and a hard place here. It is not going to be easy whichever way you look at it. \n\nBut she is 12.   What is she going to do if one of those guys drug her, make her drunk and take advantage, or God forbid rape her, dump her and then leave her pregnant at her age? Her life will be destroyed. \n\nThis needs to be taken on head on. I am so sorry you have to do this.", "Thank you for the reassurance. There\u2019s still a tiny voice telling me I\u2019m wrong but I know that I could be saving her by doing this", "Inappropriate media that is made so easily accessible. My sister just has to ask our Google home to play Cardi B and she gets rap music about getting fucked until she\u2019s sore. I don\u2019t give a fuck what Cardi B or any other rapper sings about, but a child should never have access to that type of music", "The truth is my sister is in danger and is possibly being groomed. What would you do? Let it happen?", "Thank you for your support", "This is one of those situations where a secret can't remain a secret. I'm a parent, I've had friends of my kids ask me to keep things private, and I've agreed on the condition that if I think they are in danger that I will need to tell an adult in their life (and I'll ask them to nominate one if that feels relevant, yk?).\n\nYour sister, who is still a child even if she thinks she isn't, is engaging in behaviour that is unsafe and has much longer term impacts than she has thought of. Her boyfriends/exes/other boys are asking her to do something they know she shouldn't. She has no guarantee of privacy, and the internet is forever. I know you know all of that, and that you and your parents have tried explaining that to her - the fact that she doesn't understand that is proof she doesn't have the maturity (or the trustworthiness tbh) to manage this without help.\n\nYou're doing the right thing. Your sister will be mad and think that she can't trust you and will probably say some pretty shitty things. Her attitude will change over time when she realises that you were being a responsible and caring brother, looking out for her when she couldn't look out for herself.", "You'll just lose her trust and she'll do it even more secretively. I think the way your parents are going about this makes them lose even more control over your little sister. As she grows older bigger things will come on her path. drugs, unsafe sex, etc.\n\nIf you share this secret you'll lose her trust and thus when these things come you won't have any control or oversight.\n\nNTA but definitely hurting things here. You can already see the consequences of the actions of your parents: taking away her devices. It's not working, she's just finding different ways.\n\nTeaching her about safe sex would be way more effective but scary for people. Especially if you're from more conservative countries like the U.S.A.", "Of course. \ud83e\udd17", "She needs therapy and she needs it bad. She needs to understand that this is NOT okay. This is not normal behavior. If that requires getting her social media taken away then so be it. As long as my little sister gets help"]}
