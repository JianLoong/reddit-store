Your wife needs to stop living her life through social media. Does it matter if some random people you knew at school don't see constant photo updates about your marriage? No.", "NTA. \"How will people know we're still married??\" Wow. If people have to check I'd imagine they're not important enough friends to care.", "NAH. Putting aside the specifics of social media, your wife is saying she wishes you would show pride and affection for her in a clear and possibly public way. She wants to feel appreciated and a bit shown-off. Social media is just how she's seeing other people get that these days.\n\nAre you demonstrative with your affection and approval? Do you make it clear how you feel about her? Do you show pride in and affection for her when you're with friends and family, or in public? If you're a bit reserved, she might be feeling unappreciated.\n\nBypass the selfies, ask her if she feels like you don't appreciate her enough, and if there are other, more comfortable for you, ways to show your feelings so she can feel them.", "NTA. One of my favorite quotes is from Eleanor Roosevelt, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t worry so much about what people think of you, if you\u2019d only stop to realize how seldom they do.\u201d\n\nWhether we think we\u2019ll of ourselves or whether we think poorly of ourselves, mostly we think about ourselves. Every one of us.", "INFO: do you consistently post to SM? If you post often and never photos of you both, then maybe I could see where she\u2019s a bit frustrated. However, if you rarely post, then I don\u2019t other people really notice/care. Sounds like she\u2019s seeking attention and validation which is worth exploring and making sure there aren\u2019t other underlying issues she\u2019s not being fully clear about", "NTA - you shouldn't feel obligated doing social media. It's also weird your wife needs you to update your social media regularly just so people will know you are still together lol", "NTA \n\nWife needs to grow up and not act like an insecure 17 year old. People that matter and care if you're still together will know because they know you. Who cares about the rest. Not everyone cares about or needs to know about every detail of your life posted via social media. Many people survive perfectly well without using it at all.", "NAH\nYour wife just cares way more about social media than you do. Posting every now and then to keep her happy won't hurt you, just as she should understand that you don't want your whole life on social media.", "NTA but if it were me, and it\u2019s not but if it were, I\u2019d figure out why this is so important to my wife. Something tells me there might be a deeper vulnerability or insecurity at play under this \u201cjust wanting people to see\u201d you\u2019re happy and married. Ask her what\u2019s really going on, and if it is really just the social media? Maybe all you need to understand is this fairly simple task that you are in no way obligated to do would make your partner *really* happy if you chose to do it. Sometimes it\u2019s the small things \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f people like to be heard. Still NTA, just throwing it out there.", "oof NTA \n\nunfollow her toxic ass", "NAH. Don\u2019t ask Reddit if this is necessary to please your wife. From what you\u2019ve said it\u2019s clearly important to her so getting 100s of votes from strangers that she\u2019s overreacting is irrelevant. A happy marriage is made up of small things we do for each other.\n\nAlso to be blunt if my husband was digging his heels in that much about posting me on social media on the rare occasion I\u2019d take it as a little red flag.", "NTA. Although my only source of information on my friends' marital status is FB. :D", "Here's my take on what people on social media post. Those that make their lives out to be perfect are hiding something. It's almost always exposed too.", "My husband is similar but he will post birthdays, anniversaries, Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s not always his thing but he knows it\u2019s something I love waking up to and he likes making me happy. \n\nI think you\u2019re NTA but posting a couple times a year to make her feel special is not going to hurt you and it\u2019s takes 5 minutes.", "NTA for not posting on social media but one thing to consider is if you don\u2019t take photos, there\u2019s probably not a lot of photos of her that she hasn\u2019t taken. My partner is not a photo taker but I am. I have many photos of him and the kids in everyday life but all photos of me are selfies because he doesn\u2019t really take any unless it\u2019s a special occasion. Even then it\u2019s usually me that takes them. I\u2019d love to have more photos of me with my daughter", "NTA. A bottle with one penny makes a loud racket, a bottle filled with gold is silent. You don't have to feel compelled to \"compete\" with the image others are trying to portray", "Are you eating at all if you don't post your meals on Instagram?\n\nThere is a difference between social media and the real life. Your wife should stop comparing your lifes to some staged Facebook stories. \n\nSocial media ist just not important to a big part of our society and people should stop forcing that sh\\* onto others.", "NTA - it's your account your choice, she can update hers and the people she's so worried about knowing you're still together will know. I haven't updated my Facebook in over 6 years - at this point I've forgotten my password and have 0 intentions on recovering it and start posting again, the people who want to know or are important are already present in your life *and know*. Pls don't let her brainwash you into using that shithole or other narcissistic inducing social medias, we already have too many people who live through their social media status.", "YTA - how are people going to know you\u2019re alive and successful without your pics on social media?", "You\u2019re NTA, but do you want to die on this hill? Sounds like a pretty silly little thing you could do every once in a while to make her really happy and feel cherished if it doesn\u2019t really bother you.", "NTA.  Social media is only good for damaging relationships.  It serves no other useful purpose.  If wife is making a fuss over it, best bet would be to permanently delete all your profiles.  Nothing to fuss over anymore!", "Your wife sounds superficial man. NTA , of course. What a woman!", "NTA. Your wife is all up in her head and insecure about her image since certain other husbands or partners post stuff. Some people like to post stuff and some don\u2019t. I haven\u2019t posted anything about my family in years. Pretty sure I love my kids as much as those ladies who are posting about their kids all the time. Also, absent update, people assume status quo. Tell your wife people will still assume you\u2019re married lol. I\u2019ve been divorced for a year, but my more distant friends probably assume I\u2019m still married.", "NTA - nowhere on social media is there evidence my partner and I are together but everyone that needs to know does. I tend to avoid posting pictures of people for privacy and safety", "NTA. If she wants photos posted, she can do it. Assuming you\u2019re ok with that.", "NTA\n\nAll this seeking validation through social media is very tired, and honestly frequently toxic. What exactly is she trying to prove? Is this really the issue?", "NTA, just because other couples look perfect on social media, doesn't mean they are irl I post the occasional photo of me and the partner together on sm, but he doesn't post anything at all on his lol it's not an accurate reflection of the relationship", "NTA. If it were me, I'd be angry if you DID post all the time. I hate \"show and tell\". If I want to know, I'll ask. \n\nThat being said, any pictures of new puppies or kittens in your household you have a legal obligation to share!", "Can we just make this a template AITA post and pin it on top so ppl can just read that they are NTA and don\u2019t have to write this again? This is really becoming a standard issue lately", "NTA. Women who have this need are ticking time bombs for mental health meltdowns. Living for the image is a recipe for an unhealthy mind", "Your wife sounds like a nightmare. Even if you weren't married, why does it matter that other people can't track your relationship online?

When I shaved my waist length hair raising money for cancer research", "You're NTA. \n\n> Her argument is that if I don't update my social media how will people know if we are still together\n\nWhy does she care so much what other people **might** think? Social media is a wasteland of people posting false narratives about their perfect lives anyway. \n\nSeriously, I have seen the posts with the perfectly posed family gathering, and the sweeter than syrup captions about the *amazing spouse* only to have a late night emotional call or text from the same person spilling out a tale of just how not amazing that spouse was behaving at that gathering.\n\nWhy contribute to that?

If you are truly in love, you won't feel the need to constantly tell the world on social media - you will already know what you mean to each other, and that's all that matters.", "NTA\u2026 it\u2019s so uncool now to post everything on social media. She can post herself and say stuff like \u201chubby taking me out for a date\u201d and just a photo of the date with no one. Much classier.", "I don\u2019t post anything personal on Facebook anymore.

I feel sorry in advance for any children you might have.  They will simply be props for her accounts whether they want to be or not.", "Comparison is the thief of joy. Social media trains people to compare their lives to the lives that people portray on social media and the negative mental effects are staggering. I was a heavy social media user for a long time but a couple of years ago I removed them all from my phone and only started checking when I was on a computer and even then I kept it brief. Just a small change lol that was such a mental boost for me and gave me back so much wasted time from scrolling.", "I disagree. NAH. Wife isn't an AH for liking what she likes. People like display of affections. That's what she's asking for. Reddit makes that out to be some sort of evil but it's not always.\n\nSM is also not the point, the point is she's communicating a want to her husband who is dismissing her entirely because it's not what *he* wants. This isn't a he's right/she wrong situation. It's a chance to go \"I don't always get life 100% my way, especially in marriage, because it's about compromise and finding a solution that makes us both mostly happy\" and doing that. OP isn't an AH either for not wanting to do it but if he continues bashing his wife for the things she likes/wants and communicates to him just so he gets his way 100% then he quickly could be.", "NTA.  You might get into 'trouble' for this suggestion, so use it or not with discretion... For her and to you... Because once started, you may not be allowed to stop until eithers death or divorce.\n\nSet a reminder to once a month to post a picture of your hand with your wedding ring. It's proof of your marriage and you don't need to photograph your face or anything else.\n\nYou could probably have a folder of shots available and you can just pick and post as needed.   It's probably safer to make the pictures as boring as possible.", "Yes. THIS. \n\nGuys, it's never just the flowers, or the photos, or the dishes. Sometimes women also have trouble communicating, and these are the things that are tangible. \n\n\"I want you to WANT to\", means \"I want you to show me you think about me through the day, and remember flowers make me happy\"  \nThe social media thing can easily be translated to \"I want you to be proud of me, and show me off\"", "Completely agree with you here, she's not got the self knowledge to know what she is really looking for and how to ask for that, but she knows she's missing something and she knows she'd feel better having what she sees others getting. \n\nIt's totally fine to not want to post or be posted about all the time but your wife is obviously craving recognition by you in some way or another, if you're doing it plenty at home then yes she's wanting to more you are proud of her in a more public way. If you're not doing it at home then maybe you guys need to work out how you both receive love best and make sure you're checking in on how that changes and what you both are needing from the other.", "I think this is good advice", "I agree NAH, however, everything else you said is nonsense. Do not try to put the blame on OP for this. The wife needs to stop comparing their relationship to other people\u2019s.
