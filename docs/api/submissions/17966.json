Your wife asked you to do a low cost low energy thing that takes virtually no time. You can't do it? You'd rather dig your heels in than offer her a crumb of validation. \n\nI bet you she does things for/with you she doesn't care about or like. I for instance, not a fan of a certain restaurant. But my husband loves it. So we eat there often. I like to make him happy and letting him close his favorite restaurant costs nothing other than subpar ramen. \n\nNot saying folks should let their spouses walk all over them but comeon folks... \n\nTell you what.

You don't have to go on expensive holidays or candlelit dinners to show love and gratitude.", "NAH. You don't like social media. Fair enough that's cool, you're not an asshole for not wanting to take photos and post your life online.\n\nThat being said humans aren't great at understanding the true meaning of what they want. Both men and women here. She's seeing these photos and these expressions of love and appreciation and her subconscious mind is saying \"I don't see him showing me off/publicly appreciating me. He may in private but out and about/to friends and family I don't see any ways that he's proud to have me as his wife\" the conscious mind though doesn't grasp that thought pattern. The conscious mind goes \"I want my husband to do this\" so she wants to say \"hun I want to have more public shows of affection/that you're proud to have me/that you appreciate me\" and actually says \"take more photos of us and upload them to social media\". She's not an asshole for wanting you to show her you love her publicly.", "Nta.\n\nJust clearly state you are not 16 anymore and need zero reassurance from your community that your relationship is working.\n\nI cant believe this is actually a thing for adults.", "NAH, and NTA however, would it kill you to post one knowing that it would make her happy?", "YTA", "Yes YTA", "YTA, it\u2019s such an easy request. You used to, but you stopped putting effort into your marriage, like a lot of m*n over time.", "NTA how does she think the world worked before social media?", "NTA my husband doesn't have social media anymore and I use it mostly to be updated on family and friends. I haven't posted a picture of us since we got married 3 years ago, people still knows that we are still married", "NTA and she should probably really reduce the time that she spends on it, it sounds like she gives it way too much importance, and is using it to compare her own life to others. Remind her that when people post is only a small snippet of their actual lives.", "NTA. \u201cHow will people know we are still together\u201d - see this ring on my finger\u2026\u2026.", "NTA. I think it's better to not use social media. And you have a right to not use it or post photos. However, it sounds like posting couples photos is important to your wife so I would consider posting about her on special occasions like her birthday or your anniversary because it means something to her. I think those kind of performative posts are gross and off-putting but if it means that much to your wife it's probably worth the compromise of making a few posts about her.", "NTA.\n\nYou can post on social media what you like and how often you like etc. However, your wife might need reassurance that it isn\u2019t personal to her. If it\u2019s not that important to you and it makes her feel good for whatever reason (I\u2019m not here to yuck her  yum), maybe you could update your profile pic to a photo of both of you.\n\nMy partner and I had a conversation about something similar last week. He reactivated his Facebook about 6 months ago, and has been sharing a post with a photo when he has done something exciting (eg he went with his daughter to Ed Sheeran, and got a hole in one in golf, went caving with his son). However, he hasn\u2019t ever posted anything with me in similar circumstances. Now I don\u2019t mind what he shares on his socials as it his account, but I did ask him why he doesn\u2019t share anything of me coz I may have had an inkling of insecurity that he was embarrassed of me or wanted to keep our relationship a secret. I realised that all the people who *matter to us* know that we are together, as we have been together for a couple of years now and socialise often with them. He also shows up for me in so many other ways, and our relationship doesn\u2019t require fake social media validation to know I am important to him.", "So, I've found that people who post their relationships on their socials tend to have more of a rocky \"behind the scenes\". Perhaps your wife doesn't understand that? Not everyone does. It's like \"pay no attention to the person behind the screen\".\n\nEdit to add NTA", "Okay I know facebook has a \"in a relationship with X\" option to display right on your profile. I'm sure instagram also has something like that. \n\nIf your wife wants pics posted, she can post them. \n\nNTA.", "Nta social media is quite false. You see all these happy couples but behind the scene is a different story. I can understand while seeing that your wife feels less than by comparison but she also needs to realize that all that she is seeing is false. Communication is key here. It's very easy to think yr relationship is not great when you see all the 'amazing' things on social media. You have boundaries and she should respect that. She wants things from you to show others you are invested in yr relationship, why is the validation from strangers necessary to prove yr love and interest?", "NTA. I\u2019m the same as you. I\u2019d rather experience something than be too busy documenting it. I\u2019m also private. TBH your wife sounds super insecure. Sounds like there\u2019s a real addiction to online validation she might want to explore or a trust issue she might want to explore.", "NTA Also, does she not have her own social media? She can post herself. That's kinda how it is in my relationship. My SO doesn't have social media and I do, and I do enjoy sharing snippets of life, so I do the posting if I want because it's my account.\n\nSide note: I would say that to some extent I can understand why she may get irritated about you not even wanting to take photos sometimes. I see it both ways because my mom and sister are addicted to social media and want to document everything and it's so annoying. But then I had a death in the family and realized that my family member, who I lived with for a solid 2 years, and I had barely any photos together and it broke my heart. So just something to think about here - this can be a way to compromise. Be open to taking and being in a few more pics and your wife can post to her heart's content, as long as you are fine with the photos being seen.", "NTA, you can post whatever you want to on YOUR social media, no one actually cares about other people\u2019s relationships", "NTA. My husband gets annoyed if I tag him in things because then people find out he\u2019s even on Facebook lol (he has an account to buy things on market place).

It reeks of low self-esteem or superficiality.", "NTA. When I was more active on my socials, I was the one posting all of our cute pics and stuff. As life went on, I just didn't see a point anymore.

I would assume that men get women( photo at least)  doing the same thing. \nMaybe  OP likes that attention? Maybe wife is insecure about it.", "It's been my experience that the people who post the most are the furthest from their perception of \"happy\".  Don't stunt.  Live your life.  If your wife cares more about looks than the strength of your marriage, that's on her.  NTA.", "NTA I hate social media. Everyone posts an idealized life. They only post the best.

Because Laura from the PTA\u2019s husband (or whatever) is posting things so what will the other mom\u2019s think. Is her marriage on the rocks? Does he even love her?  It\u2019s all destructive bullshit. It sucks the life out of people.", "That wasn't my intent, it's just that he's the one here asking the questions, so he's the only one I can usefully make suggestions to :) \n\nAnd really, even if the best solution to the problem turns out to be her quitting social media cause it makes her feel bad about herself, it can't hurt for him to open the conversation by asking about her feelings. When it comes to the people we love, compassion is always a good place to start a conversation.", "There\u2019s hope left for humanity!!!", "My whole family is like that while I am not.. I don't see the point in making these posts for everything... birthdays and any other special moment.. just because you're posting for everyone to see doesn't mean you care more about them than I do... not everything has to be a big display on social media..", "I don't know how else to explain this- Actually u/princess_ferocious said it beautifully [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pijes/comment/jl9u0au/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [then here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pijes/comment/jla5eb3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  \n\n\nIt's not about the SM.", "You don't know the level of destruction, if any, it has on her. And to equate it to meth is ridiculous. Does having a couple drinks a week or a glass of wine make me an alcoholic? Does going on a shopping spree make me financially irresponsible? No. To say the act of doing it or thinking something immediately equates to a destructive addiction is misrepresenting the facts for dramatic flair.\n\nAlso where does he say she gives him shit? Where does it say she's pressuring him? She has a different opinion/values/stance on it than he does. That's all OP tells us. He even says it's a *small* disagreement between them. And what do you do during a small disagreement with the person you're married too? You find a compromise and figure out what's bugging her and how to make you both happy with the outcome.", "This isn't what wife is communicating.\n\nIf that is what wife wants to communicate, that is what wife should communicate. She's a fully grown adult - talking in code and expecting the other party to guess correctly is childish.", "I know all I need to know that it\u2019s destructive behavior from one line: \n\nHer argument is that if I don\u2019t update my social media how will people know we\u2019re still together?"]}
