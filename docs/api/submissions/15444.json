The first time she was hospitalized, she asked to stay over and help us clean and we refused. Due to the fact that she talks so much crap and is so judge mental. She thinks we are keeping her away from her grand daughter, and sometimes I question myself if I am, but my husband and i live very stressful lives and i feel she stressed us out more. I also wonder if I am being the ass hole and just put my stress and feelings aside and just let her come and see her grandchild.

You're asking for a few days to recover from a traumatic event, not to keep your daughter away for life. If she never comes over again, that's on her.

I get that grandma wants to see her but unless she wants to come over and actually HELP ( like clean the house), being expected to be treated as a guest is a no go.", "Totally NTA, but can't she book a hotel room?", "NTA - you have a sick child and all need mental and physical recovery. All you asked for was a couple days, not a couple weeks. YOU live with the child and have to deal with adjusting to her disease, not her. MIL needs to learn boundaries and understand the disease itself.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. You don\u2019t have to host someone if you don\u2019t want to, even if everyone was feeling well.

I hope you will not have to go through this again.", "NTA, 1000%.\nYou've all been through an insanely difficult ordeal and the absolute last thing you need is to feel pressured to tidy up and look presentable for your MIL. You have every right to say your need a few days to recover properly.  You're not saying she can never see her granddaughter again, you're asking for some time to recharge after a difficult hospital stay.", "NTA because you are well within your rights to want to rest but...who says you have to clean? Why not ask your MIL if she could help around the house and watch your daughter while you relax? Obviously you don't have to do any of that - being exhausted is a good enough reason to ask for some more - but it's just (to me) a weird thing to get yourself hung up on.\n\nSorry about this whole situation anyway. I hope she and you all feel better.

And to start crying over this? If I shared my actual thoughts on your MIL, I'd get banned, but in my opinion, the asshole here isn't you.", "Nope definitely NTA but she is and also very selfish. She can wait a few days, at the very least! Unless she\u2019s offering to come over and HELP you then she needs to suck it up and wait til you\u2019re ready for visitors. Im sorry about your daughter\u2019s health issues, offering you big hugs!!", "NTA as a mom, my heart goes out to you. what an awful situation to have been in! and on top of that, now you have to deal with someone emotionally manipulating you because what they want is more important than anything else. i\u2019m sorry.", "NTA. Based on your comments it sounds like a visit from your MIL will only cause you more stress, which is the last thing you need or deserve right now. \n\nA woman who checked your house for dust when visiting to meet her newborn granddaughter has shown that she values judging you over supporting you and your family.", "NTA Your MIL is. She's being very selfish otherwise she would understand your feelings and respect your request. A few days won't hurt her and would give you the rest you need. Prayers and thoughts are with you.", "Possible NAH\n\nYou\u2019re emotionally exhausted so it makes complete sense you need to rest. \n\nShe loves your granddaughter so of course she\u2019s worried. \n\nMy final decision depends on whether you\u2019re too exhausted for company or if you really are just so focused on how your house looks you can\u2019t even let your MIL see her granddaughter. \n\nIf it\u2019s the cleanliness that\u2019s a pride issue, not an exhaustion issue and changes my vote to YTA.", "NTA! That\u2019s a lot to go through: if she wants to be there for her grandchild she could pay for someone to come clean the house for you. Otherwise she\u2019s just got to wait. Even without the medical issues, you\u2019re allowed to tell her no!", "NTA. Her first question if she truly cared should have been \"what can I do to help?\"", "NTA. Your not saying don't come over ever, your saying not right now. All of you are exhausted and need to unwind, need a few days of relaxing with your kiddo. \n\nIf she doesn't understand that you need a week at the most to come to your newest *normal* ( loving a child with medical conditions is extremely draining especially when your in charge of that child) maybe grandma needs to take a step away for a while. \nYour kid has life long conditions that will not go away and grandma can't throw a tantrum when she doesn't get her way.", "NTA.MIL is making this all about her. Let her cry all she wants - you have a 4 year old with medical issues and that is more important. It is sad MIL doesn\u2019t see it.", "NTA- MIL is!! Sounds like everything is about me syndrome and I don\u2019t care what you feel, the only one that matters is ME!", "NTA. Not only are you as parents exhausted, that baby has been poked, prodded, and her body absolutely wreck over the last two weeks. Grandma should just leave everyone alone if for nothing else to let that baby sleep and recover.", "NAH\n\nOf course you're not an asshole. You're absolutely drained, scared for your child, and doing the best that you can.\n\nBut I'm going to gently note that while a lot of people are going to judge this N-T-A due to your MIL's (admittedly unreasonable and thoughtless) response, and call her the asshole, I can't bring myself to do that either. You're right to ask her to wait a few days, and she shouldn't have said those things. \n\nBut she loves you and your daughter, her own baby's baby, and I think that we don't often enough make space emotionally on this sub for other people's legitimate emotions beyond the poster, or for the fact that more than one thing can be simultaneously true, and that sometimes there are no AHs, only scared family members in difficult situations who sometimes are not their best selves . . . but that doesn't necessarily make them assholes. \n\nFor example, while your MIL was definitely not being her best self, or emotionally helpful in the way you need right now, the fact that she offered to help clean was sort of indicative of the fact that she didn't expect you to \"play hostess\" . . . she just wants to be near y'all, to see with her own eyes that her grandbaby is going to be okay. She has probably been as terrified as you have, but has had to do so from a distance.\n\nAnd again, *I am absolutely not faulting you for a single thing you've done*. You have handled this exactly the way you needed to, and there's nothing wrong with that. But as an auntie who would lie down in traffic for my sister's kids, when any of them have been hospitalised or hurt for far lesser things than you describe here, while I would do my best not to make demands of my sister, I know it's been hard when all I've wanted to do is show up on the doorstep and gather them all in my arms - sister included. \n\nI don't think there are any AHs here, and I hope you all can get past this.", "YTA. \n\nYou are keeping your husband's mother, your child's grandmother, away during a health crisis, because you're tired and don't want to clean? Wtf. \n\nThis is the precise time you should expect a visit from your mother-on-law.  You don't even have to clean. People understand, and even if they don't, why care? You have more important things to concern yourself with.", "Of course, NTA.  Did she come visit while your daughter was in the hospital?  Did she help at the house while you were tending to your child?  Did she get you groceries while you were sleeping in a chair next to your daughter's hospital bed?\n\nTell your husband to tell his mother to get over her hysterical self.  Your focus needs to be on your daughter.  She can't make you feel guilty unless you let her.  Stand strong, Mama Bear.", "NTA", "She\u2019s very old school and thinks if we\u2019re stressed just stop thinking about it and you won\u2019t be stressed anymore.", "Yeah A of all grandma should not set foot in that house without at least two casseroles in hand, and prepared to clean/do laundry/cook. But B of all if someone who just got home from the hospital with their child asks you to wait a few days to visit, you wait a few days. Without complaint. And send a gift certificate for DoorDash.", "May be she is trying to help by taking care of the baby so that the mom can take some sleep . And do other works .", "I\u2019ve asked her to. Her thing is she says we\u2019re family and we have an extra room why should she.", "While true that they get to make decisions about such things, it doesn't change the fact that it's still an AH move. The justification for the action given is they're tired and don't want to clean, which makes this an AH move.", "No she\u2019s not helping lol she\u2019ll send me to clean and then expect me to host", "Yeah, i know it\u2019s weird I\u2019ve been told by my friends too lol. That\u2019s why i question myself. She\u2019s a clean freak and expects everyone to be like her, she also is a big gossiper. It\u2019s a reallly weird situation. I just feel like if she\u2019d give me a day to get my emotions together as well as tidy up so I don\u2019t have to deal with her \u201cyou should clean\u201d comments which she does all the time.", "It\u2019s a combination of both, my daughter is still going through this rash we\u2019re trying to figure out. As well as my mother in law is very judge mental, and isn\u2019t afraid of saying things and i just am not in the mood for her you need to clean comments.", "I think it also depends on how the MIL is about tidiness. My grandma was happy to drop critiques about her opinions on my mom's housekeeping, but couldn't be bothered to help tidy to her satisfaction. Just made sure to offer nonhelpful observations. If this MIL is of the sort that my grandma was, I'd say it's less pride on OP's part and more, \"one less thing to be bothered about right now.\"", "In comments she says her MIL is very judgmental and the idea of her coming over is giving her bad anxiety.", "Because being badgered by a MIL is the last thing a woman who likely spent several days wondering if her daughter would live or die needs right now. \nMy daughter was hospitalized for 6 weeks with a bone infection in her ankle. It wasn't life threatening (unlike 60+ seizures a day) but I still needed a few days to actually get some real sleep and recover from the bone deep exhaustion that comes with having a hospitalized child.", "She cares, she comes and criticizes everything. Once when my daughter was born she came and put her hands on everything to check if there was dust. So she gives me anxiety.", "Im the wife actually. It\u2019s my husband mom.", "That's not old school. That's stupid.", "She's being incredibly selfish. It would actually require less of her to be a kind and supportive person at a difficult time, but instead she has to throw a tantrum because you told her *no*. Except it wasn't even *no*, it was just *not yet*.\n\nIt's kind of you to come up with a rationale for her behavior, but there are some limits to assuming positive intent. \n\nIt's really dysfunctional to throw more stress your way at a very difficult time. If she knows better, it's horrible that she chose to impose anyway. \n\nIf she doesn't know better, then the only thing you can do is have firm boundaries and make sure her tantrums *never* pay off. There's no middle ground. Tantrums must never get her what she wants.", "Then tell her to stop thinking about not being able to see her grandchild and she'll get over her stress.", "I\u2019ve had several friends do that. They\u2019ve been great.", "Yeah that\u2019s my thought too, but she\u2019s also very judgmental and gets me into panic mode. I want to just have 1 day to just get to somewhat normal. She\u2019s still having this rash from her seizure medication that we\u2019re going to doctors tmrw to figure out. Idk i don\u2019t want to keep her away but i need my sanity.", "It is absolutely not an ah move when Op has made it clear her mil is judgemental af", "I completely understand that, i talked to her and told her to come just to come later on in the night time to give us some time to unwind. The cleaning part is mostly to my past experience with her being a clean freak and commenting on my house, running her fingers down things and seeing if there\u2019s dust.", "Are you volunteering to go over to their house and clean so that they don\u2019t have to deal with judgmental comments from MIL, after dealing with a major medical crisis? \n\nThey need time to rest and recover, that doesn\u2019t make them an AH.", "They're dealing with a sick child, who has been hospitalized for two weeks and faces more doctor visits.  That is emotionally draining.  Whether or not the house is vacuumed is at the bottom of the list.", "\"Sorry, mom, not up to visitors right now.  Baby girl has more doctor visits ahead of her.  Please, feel free to drop off your gift but you won't be able to stay.\"", "I see. That is irritating and it enhances the rest of your case. Unfortunate situation, thanks for the clarification.", "NAH\n\nTell her the truth if you don\u2019t think she\u2019ll flip out on you.", "That\u2019s fair. I didn\u2019t consider the MIL would be focused on that over the daughter. That\u2019s projection on my part because I don\u2019t know her. \n\nThank you for this perspective.", "She replied to me. I was the first commenter so I didn\u2019t have that info.", "I misread and fixed it. Sorry about that.", "Ok yeah nope.  Keep the judgement away.  \n\nHugs, Internet stranger.  I\u2019m currently dealing with a medical emergency and my house looks like a tornado hit it.  Do what you need to do.", "If her intention was to help, she would have said something like \"why don't I come over and spend time with her while you guys nap and take a shower? \"\nWhat she asked was to bring gifts. \nStick to your boundaries.", "Is your husband around? Because if so, he (AS HER SON) should be running interference here. This should not be on you.", "No. That is stupid.  \n\nI am suggesting that sometimes it's more important for one action to occur than another. I am suggesting that a grandmother wanting to see a grandchild in the middle of a health crisis, in an attempt to make the CHILD feel better is a higher priority than not wanting to hear slightly judgemental comments about cleanliness or whatever. I am suggesting OP should have just sucked up the situation and dealt with something uncomfortable for the sake of the child and her relationship with her grandmother in a time where she's sick. I am suggesting that the benefits to the child in this scenario far outweigh watching a mother-in-law run a finger down a shelf or whatever. \n\nIn short, I am suggesting OP should have acted like an adult and not a petulant adolescent that can't handle a small amount of POTENTIAL conflict for the benefit of her child.\n\nThe number of people in this SR who can't handle simple disagreements or differences in opinion and instead choose to permanently damage familial relationships is simply astounding.", "Nothing wrong with your perspective, either! It just means you've (hopefully) had a positive MIL-experience.\n\nMy grandma was such an overbearing MIL that as I grew older, she was the reason I decided I would *never* get married. Then, I met my fiance, and when I saw how amazing his mom was with his brother's wife, I started to let my guard down about MILs. I wouldn't say we are friends exactly- she has a really full and active life with her senior friends and not tons of time for \"you kids\"- but we are friendly, and her complete contrast to my grandmother softened me enough to accept my partner's marriage proposal last winter.", "Why would you? All the concern about issues with cleanliness come from OP making assumptions. This was her primary stated reason for turning the MIL away, and followup responses further bear this out. OP just doesn't like the MIL, making this decision an AH move.", "Yeah \"helpful\" is leaving a casserole on the doorstep. And I would posit that someone who makes you feel like you need to clean before they come over (in a goddam full-on family emergency) is not capable of being a person who could truly be helpful.", "My husband is scared of her, because if we say anything that doesn\u2019t go with what she wants she starts crying. She\u2019s been like that for the 13 yrs we\u2019ve been together.", ">The number of people in this SR who can't handle simple disagreements or differences in opinion and instead choose to permanently damage familial relationships is simply astounding.\n\nSays the one who advices to ignore manipulative and abusive behaviour in a very trying and stressful situation.\n\nThe MIL is the one damaging the relationship, not OP.", "The MIL is not a help.  She is judgmental and manipulative and cries to get her way.  OP does not need to deal with that crap right now.", "Over the last month they have spent over two weeks in the hospital. You know what\u2019s more important for the child, having caregivers who are mentally and emotionally healthy. \n\nYour thinking is not rational. OP isnt banning MIL from coming over, she is asking for a few days. The level of reaction from MIL to a reasonable request is absurd.", "Okay, sounds like you and your husband need some counseling so he can get a nice shiny spine.", "My thinking is more rational than most of the other responses here, including yours. Absolutely nothing I have seen indicates the mother-in-law is not mentally healthy. All I have seen is OP indicates that she's a clean freak, and it comes through that OP simply does not like the MIL. \n\nI will point this discussion back at the original post where OP's main concerns were they were tired and didn't want to clean.  There was absolutely no concern about core issues like mental instability, crazy drama, danger to the child, or anything like that. All subsequent clarifications I have read from OP just seem to indicate OP and MIL don't see eye-to-eye - OP doesn't seem to like the MIL, and THAT is what actually drove this decision, and that makes OP an AH.\n\nOP is the unreasonable one here. People assuming the MIL is some crazy person because she critiques the cleanliness of OP's home (we have NO idea if that's justified or not, by the way) is the irrational bit. People disagree about things, and that doesn't make one or both of them mentally unhealthy. \n\nWe must also always remember that we are only getting OP's viewpoint, and we have to interpret with the information provided whole trying to detect the inherent bias."]}
