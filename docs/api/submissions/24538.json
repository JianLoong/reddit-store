Also he didn\u2019t want to have lunch with his mom and I feel he thew me under the bus instead of being truthful with her.  \n\nOver the course of 2 years together there has been many attempts by his mother to break us up. It started with the day we were engaged! We bought a house and right after signing he proposed and all on my favorite holiday! Up until this point she was, what I really thought would be a really great MIL and nothing like the stories I had heard. \n\nUntil I showed her the ring. Not a word until she turned to her son and said \u201cI thought you were never going to get married?\u201d. From there it\u2019s been downhill. When her 1st 2nd & 3rd attempt to get him upset with me didn\u2019t work she went so far as to try and convince him that I was abusing his daughter!! This did strike a big fight with us! \n\nAccording to my husband and all of his siblings this is not the time she\u2019s done this and until this point had all turned the other cheek and brushed it off to \u201cthat\u2019s just our mother, ignore it!\u201d. This was too far for me.   Not only being a mother myself, but also being heavily involved in the community with youth this attack on my character was not something I would ever brush aside and we got into a huge fight. I let him know that this would not be ok and to put himself in my shoes! This seemed to wake him up.   He stood his ground and told her she wasn\u2019t welcome until I got a face to face apology and was ok with it. \n\nThere have been 2 more times since this that she has tried by text message, knowing that my husband and I share phones, to get he and I into arguments to break us up including telling me that \u201cshe will always be my husbands and his daughters mothers and I can learn my place as a step mother\u201d. \n\nNeedless to say this was the last contact I had with her. \n\nOur wedding is in 2 months and could be the next time I see her.   Yes you did read that correctly, we eloped without telling some of my family and all of his. My anxiety was through the roof and i was having panic attacks thinking about it. So that if/when she pulls a scene at our wedding she didn\u2019t get to ruin the actual moment for us. \n\nWhich leads us to today.  I was woke up from his mother blowing up his phone very early, with her asking him to pick her up and take her to lunch.   Instead of telling her he and I have plans, he wrote her and said that \u201coh I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know you wanted to go to lunch, (insert my name) and I have plans to do stuff for the wedding\u201d. We didn\u2019t have any such plans, just plans to have lunch together! So I asked the 1st question that came to mind. But we don\u2019t have plans to do for the wedding and why isn\u2019t it enough you want to spend time with me? He has yelled at me or given me the silent treatment all day because of \u201cmy loaded question\u201d and when I try to explain to him how he\u2019s protecting her feelings while shitting all over mine it just gets worse. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1691906635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pr0ek/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_should_have_told/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is petty, and you are angry at the wrong person. It must be incredibly frustrating to be constantly on edge and ready to fight with the mother of the man you love.

I realize now this post doesn\u2019t touch on that all wedding planning has fallen on me even after I asked to just elope.

This is emotional hostage taking.", "If you're mad about having to solo plan a wedding you don't want then address that in a separate conversation as husband and wife. But that's a completely separate issue to this situation with his Mum. And if your resentment keeps turning these two separate issues into one thing, you're going to undo all the progress you've made as a couple in developing healthy boundaries with his Mum. \n\nFor example in this situation, your husband behaved appropriately. His Mum wanted to hang out, he declined because he had plans with you, he referenced the wedding because he knew his Mum couldn't argue given how soon it is. Instead of acknowledging this was a massive step your husband made in the right direction, you flipped out on your husband for using the wedding as an excuse because of your resentment. But to your husband, he's thinking, what difference does it make if I say that lunch is for me and you or if the lunch is for me and you to plan the wedding? As long as I don't put my Mum before us, why does it matter? How are your demands different from my Mum's if you keep changing the goalpost? Because your husband is unaware how angry, hurt and unappreciated you feel about the wedding planning, your outburst lead to another fight. \n\n\nYou both need to work on your communication issues ASAP. This isn't healthy."]}
