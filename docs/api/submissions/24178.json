She always covers their faces and the pictures mostly go in to a photo book for other clients to look at that stays in the salon and is never seen by men.

Well, my friend posted one of the photos where you could see absolutely none of her face online. Her client saw it and was distraught because men could see it. My friend argued no one would even know it was her but the client threatened to sue her if she didn't take it down. Then the client and her friends called the owner and said that they wouldn't be back as long as my friend was employed there because they no longer felt safe there.  So Polly was fired. \n\nPolly told me and another friend (we'll call Lucy) this at lunch yesterday with a whole woe is me attitude.  Then she asked me what I thought about it.  I told her honestly that what she did was out of line, that this was a long term client not a new one and Polly knew she was a hijabi and had chosen to ignore her religious beliefs. That she had deserved everything that happened to her. This upset Polly and she yelled that it was a single mistake, called me a judgemental bitch and then stormed out of the restaurant. \n\nLucy thinks I was too harsh on her, that she didn't mean to harm anyone and she was just excited about her work and had made a simple mistake that she tried to correct by deleting the pictuere\nI trust Lucy and now I am wondering if maybe I was the asshole for not taking Pollys side.", "created_utc": 1691499499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lhili/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_was_out_of_line/", "score": 2204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's about personal boundaries, bodily autonomy, and so much more. And so the women they go to at a salon, or for wigs or hair coverings, or anything to do with their bodies are considered trusted friends. These are people they share a certain intimacy with, who see parts of them that they choose to share selectively with the world at large. \n\nThey would feel not just upset from a religious standpoint (although that would be a huge deal) but incredibly betrayed by someone they had put their trust in, and likely considered a friend. \n\nYou're right that Polly should have been fired.

Ofcourse what she did is appalling and is already facing the consequences.  I think the bigger question is that she was seeking solace in her friends and maybe some modicum of comfort that she can use to build on and try to move on. \n\nSo it really it depends on how you delivered the message, how recently she had been fired etc. You are right in being honest but sometimes being honest/being right and being a good friend are two separate things. \n\n\nFrankly, your harsh honesty doesn't have any impact on the outcome now right? She has already been fired. So why be harsh? It is not that you are friends with the client. You are Polly's friend. Be it. If this all happened recently, then your friends may not be prepared to hear the honesty.

Or so caught up in their own excitement, etc.\n\nDid you ALREADY know that your friend did things like this, posting photos of people online without their express/explicit permission? Did you caution her at any point prior to this? \n\nI honestly think the explosion of social media has desensitized people to how weird posting everything online is, so she might have thought nothing of it prior to this.

I said the holy book.  It could be the Bible, the Torah, the Baghavadgita (did I spell that right?).   Any of them.\n\nAnd while **you** say that the Koran doesn't require women to cover their hair, that isn't the scholarly consensus:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"There is no consensus over how much of a veil is a necessity. Some legal systems accept the hijab as an order to cover everything except the face and hands,\\[14\\]\\[10\\] while others accept it as an order that covers the whole body, including the face and hands.\\[15\\] These guidelines are found in texts of hadith and fiqh developed after the revelation of the Qur'an. Some believe these are derived from the verses (ayahs) referencing hijab in the Qur'an;\\[16\\] others believe that the Qur'an does not mandate that women need to wear a hijab.\"", "Nah you\u2019re the consent expert. Tell me how bad it is that a lady\u2019s hair is showing on the internet and defend her consent when she\u2019s Muslim and literally has no rights lol", "\"These guidelines are found in texts of hadith and fiqh\"\n\nThis is your clue. Like any religion, Islam is way, way bigger than its holy book. The Qur'an lays the groundwork for a bunch of stuff like the law on divorce, inheritance, etc., but the vast majority of the specifics are the products of centuries of later scholarship by multiple schools of law. There are many Islams, just like there are many forms of Christianity, or Judaism, or socialism, or environmentalism, or any other big system of ideas developed by many minds over generations.\n\nThe Qur'an enjoins both men and women to dress modestly, in consecutive verses. It does not mention hijab in that context.", "lol, only the entirety of Muslim law.\n\nEither way, what on earth makes you think that violating someone's consent is a good way to somehow address the injustice of a religion that you believe violates consent? How does that logic work?\n\nYou sound like the sort of people who think that the way to liberate Muslim women from the oppression of being told what to wear is to tell them what they must *not* to wear. As is so often the case, Muslim women end up being the punching bag.", "So you don't think her consent is relevant?"]}
