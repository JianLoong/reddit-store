The doors can only be opened from the inside and there are no windows so men can not see in and see their hair at any time. \n\nPolly often photographs client styles when she's done. She always covers their faces and the pictures mostly go in to a photo book for other clients to look at that stays in the salon and is never seen by men. Sometimes however she posts certain clients online. Usually clients who don't have religious hair restrictions. Recently however, she has a Muslim client who got a really cool style and dye job that she'd never seen or done before. \n\nShe asked her if she could photograph it when she was done and the client said yes thinking it was just going in the salon photo book. Well, my friend posted one of the photos where you could see absolutely none of her face online. Her client saw it and was distraught because men could see it. My friend argued no one would even know it was her but the client threatened to sue her if she didn't take it down. Then the client and her friends called the owner and said that they wouldn't be back as long as my friend was employed there because they no longer felt safe there.  So Polly was fired. \n\nPolly told me and another friend (we'll call Lucy) this at lunch yesterday with a whole woe is me attitude.  Then she asked me what I thought about it.  I told her honestly that what she did was out of line, that this was a long term client not a new one and Polly knew she was a hijabi and had chosen to ignore her religious beliefs. That she had deserved everything that happened to her. This upset Polly and she yelled that it was a single mistake, called me a judgemental bitch and then stormed out of the restaurant. \n\nLucy thinks I was too harsh on her, that she didn't mean to harm anyone and she was just excited about her work and had made a simple mistake that she tried to correct by deleting the pictuere\nI trust Lucy and now I am wondering if maybe I was the asshole for not taking Pollys side.", "created_utc": 1691499499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lhili/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_was_out_of_line/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A client asked to have her picture removed from social media. Polly's response should have been an apology and immediate removal of the photo. Instead, she chose to argue. That's two mistakes right there, three if you count the fact that she didn't disclose to the client beforehand  that this photo would be posted on socials for all to see.", "NTA\n\nPolly deserved to get called out. First, she should've checked from the client if it was OK to post the pictures online. Then she doubled down when the customer asked the picture to be taken down. That's her HUGE mess up and she deserved to get fired after that. She had to be threatened by a lawsuit, then she took the picture down. This wasn't just a simple mistake by Polly, it was a chain of mistakes.", "NTA. She worked in a hijabi salon there is no logical reason for thinking this would be okay and she absolutely deserves what she got. In some Muslim countries and families she could have been disowned or worse for this. Also the client started out just asking her to take it down and instead she doubled down on what she did until the client threatened to sue? Her consequences are literally the absolute bare minimum that could have happened.", "NTA. \n\nYou're right. At the end of the day her job and environment should have let her know that posting something like that online was a no no. \n\nAlso not even discussing posting it online with her client beforehand and assuming it would be ok is her fault. \n\nNot everyone has a friend that will tell them flatly you deserve what you got. She should have known better because that's just a huge violation.", "Religion aside, she's TA for not getting explicit consent to post online.", "NTA\n\nPolly was waaaaay out of line. And she absolutely deserved what happened to her.", "NTA\n\nWhat she did wasn't a mistake. Those women put serious trust in her and she made a choice. I am not particularly religious but one of my sisters and several of my close friends are Orthodox Jews who cover their hair. It's a choice that they take very seriously, and that is deeply meaningful to them. \n\nThe thing that a lot of people don't realise is that hair-covering is not just an \"ohhh, hide your sexiness from men\" thing. It's about personal boundaries, bodily autonomy, and so much more. And so the women they go to at a salon, or for wigs or hair coverings, or anything to do with their bodies are considered trusted friends. These are people they share a certain intimacy with, who see parts of them that they choose to share selectively with the world at large. \n\nThey would feel not just upset from a religious standpoint (although that would be a huge deal) but incredibly betrayed by someone they had put their trust in, and likely considered a friend. \n\nYou're right that Polly should have been fired. Not just for the picture, but because she didn't take that trust seriously, or understand how much faith had been put in her by her clients and what a big deal it was. She wasn't the right person to be working with those communities if she couldn't understand that. You are NTA.", "NTA. She should've known better.", "NTA you\u2019re right she had a woe is me attitude hoping for y\u2019all to baby her mistakes\u2026 but this wasn\u2019t a little she accidentally posted the wrong style to her socials\u2026 she had a long term client relationship with this person\u2026 knew this persons beliefs \u2026 and truly thought \u201coh one picture one time won\u2019t hurt\u201d.. um Im pretty sure the religi\u00f3n for this woman specifically goes against the hair even being showed\u2026 so the fact that\u2019s what she posted is 100% a violation\u2026 it\u2019s like posting someone naked\u2026 I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it.. but to them to be without their cover is like being naked\u2026 the fact she posted that woman\u2019s hair was a total violation", "You say that Lucy is telling you Polly \"tried to correct by deleting the pictuere,\" but earlier you say \"My friend argued no one would even know it was her.\" Which is it? To me, it sounds like Polly didn't want to take the photo down and Lucy's trying to think the best of her.\n\nEither way, NTA. Polly's actions are indefensible. How could any of her clients feel safe with her again after this massive breach of trust?", "Even though the religious reasons are stupid and barbaric (I loathe all \nIbrahimic theologies) you're still NTA, this is not just \"one mistake\" it's a gigantic professional betrayal of faith.", "Info:  was online the salon she worked at a website/socials or her personal website/social media", "NTA your friend shouldn\u2019t have argued, with the customer over taking her picture down. But I do think you where a little harsh.  She\u2019s already suffering, the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPolly was rightfully fired.", "It wasn't just a mistake though. It sounds like if it was, even the client would understand. She made a mistake and refused to admit it and remedy it. NTA obvs", "neither were the assholes. the lady shouldnt have even allowed a picture to be taken if there was an issue of men seeing it. hell when my wife gets her hair done theres nothing else to do so ill even look through the books. men were gonna see it either way.", "ESH\n\nPolly got herself fired for doing what she did.   AH\n\nYOU are a shitty friend.  Your friend came to you and Lucy for support and you chose to be a judgmental you-know-what.   AH\n\nTry to be a better friend and listener next time.", "NTA you don't breach a safe space and that is exactly what she did.", "NTA. Polly blatantly disrespected a client. It was the religious equivalent of posting her nudes online.", "It was a simple mistake, until the client wanted it gone and Polly argued.\n\nNot showing the face doesn't equal consent. There are unidentifiable pictures of my insides being used at a teaching hospital, and I still had to give written consent. The client said no.\n\nNTA.", "ESH.\n\nPolly is absolutely wrong and an AH for not being sensitive. \n\n But i wonder if you could have been a better friend. Ofcourse what she did is appalling and is already facing the consequences.  I think the bigger question is that she was seeking solace in her friends and maybe some modicum of comfort that she can use to build on and try to move on. \n\nSo it really it depends on how you delivered the message, how recently she had been fired etc. You are right in being honest but sometimes being honest/being right and being a good friend are two separate things. \n\n\nFrankly, your harsh honesty doesn't have any impact on the outcome now right? She has already been fired. So why be harsh? It is not that you are friends with the client. You are Polly's friend. Be it. If this all happened recently, then your friends may not be prepared to hear the honesty. Kindness and second chances especially from one's own friends are not unrealistic expectations even if one is 100% wrong. \n\nSo tell us were you casually cruel in the name of being honest? (\ud83e\udde3)", "ESH. On the one hand, you were right. It was a bad decision for her to make.\n\nOn the other hand, you... sound like a person lacking tact. You were okay to say everything up to \"you deserve...\"\n\nBecause sometimes people are dumb. Or uninformed. Or so caught up in their own excitement, etc.\n\nDid you ALREADY know that your friend did things like this, posting photos of people online without their express/explicit permission? Did you caution her at any point prior to this? \n\nI honestly think the explosion of social media has desensitized people to how weird posting everything online is, so she might have thought nothing of it prior to this. She's a dumbass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
