She always covers their faces and the pictures mostly go in to a photo book for other clients to look at that stays in the salon and is never seen by men.

Recently however, she has a Muslim client who got a really cool style and dye job that she'd never seen or done before. \n\nShe asked her if she could photograph it when she was done and the client said yes thinking it was just going in the salon photo book. Well, my friend posted one of the photos where you could see absolutely none of her face online. Her client saw it and was distraught because men could see it. My friend argued no one would even know it was her but the client threatened to sue her if she didn't take it down. Then the client and her friends called the owner and said that they wouldn't be back as long as my friend was employed there because they no longer felt safe there.  So Polly was fired. \n\nPolly told me and another friend (we'll call Lucy) this at lunch yesterday with a whole woe is me attitude.  Then she asked me what I thought about it.  I told her honestly that what she did was out of line, that this was a long term client not a new one and Polly knew she was a hijabi and had chosen to ignore her religious beliefs. That she had deserved everything that happened to her. This upset Polly and she yelled that it was a single mistake, called me a judgemental bitch and then stormed out of the restaurant. \n\nLucy thinks I was too harsh on her, that she didn't mean to harm anyone and she was just excited about her work and had made a simple mistake that she tried to correct by deleting the pictuere\nI trust Lucy and now I am wondering if maybe I was the asshole for not taking Pollys side.", "created_utc": 1691499499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lhili/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_was_out_of_line/", "score": 1565, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's about personal boundaries, bodily autonomy, and so much more. And so the women they go to at a salon, or for wigs or hair coverings, or anything to do with their bodies are considered trusted friends. These are people they share a certain intimacy with, who see parts of them that they choose to share selectively with the world at large. \n\nThey would feel not just upset from a religious standpoint (although that would be a huge deal) but incredibly betrayed by someone they had put their trust in, and likely considered a friend. \n\nYou're right that Polly should have been fired.

Ofcourse what she did is appalling and is already facing the consequences.  I think the bigger question is that she was seeking solace in her friends and maybe some modicum of comfort that she can use to build on and try to move on. \n\nSo it really it depends on how you delivered the message, how recently she had been fired etc. You are right in being honest but sometimes being honest/being right and being a good friend are two separate things. \n\n\nFrankly, your harsh honesty doesn't have any impact on the outcome now right? She has already been fired. So why be harsh? It is not that you are friends with the client. You are Polly's friend. Be it. If this all happened recently, then your friends may not be prepared to hear the honesty.

Or so caught up in their own excitement, etc.\n\nDid you ALREADY know that your friend did things like this, posting photos of people online without their express/explicit permission? Did you caution her at any point prior to this? \n\nI honestly think the explosion of social media has desensitized people to how weird posting everything online is, so she might have thought nothing of it prior to this.

She fully deserved it.", "She should\u2019ve taken those pics down and apologized profusely as soon as the customer called to complain.\n\nInstead she doubled down and risked the overall business due to her breach of trust and refusal to take responsibility. \n\nI agree with you, maybe she\u2019ll learn to respect other people\u2019s beliefs and figure out that her social media preferences aren\u2019t universal.", "OK, you jumped an important step:  After the client wanted the picture off the site, did your friend take it off?", "NTA, considering the client she should have asked before posting the picture even without her face and once the client complained she should have sincerely apologized for her ignorance and taken the photograph down. She may have kept her job then.", "NTA. I know that religion plays a HUGE part in this, but even without that. She agreed to a photo. That's it. Seems like there was NO informed consent to post it online.

Polly needs to educate herself about the perks and risks of putting stuff in the internet. And that you don't put pictures of other people online without their consent.

Polly absolutely deserved to be fired. She knows her clients religious beliefs, knew they would feel violated and knew they would refuse. That is why she didn't tell them she wanted the photo on her social media. The stupid thing is if she had apologised and immediately deleted it when the client first asked her to take it down, it is unlikely it would have ended in  her being fired. But she doubled down and refused, forcing the client to escalate.", "It doesn't matter if anyone could recognize her or not.

She needs to do and be better, behind closed doors and not just to conservative women's faces. Otherwise she's just a grifter and might hurt someone more in the future.", "If insteed of arguing with the woman that \"no one would know its you\" if she just apoligiezd and deleted the pic online she prob still have a jobb.

She made her own bed now she can sleep in it.", "NTA first and foremost, polly asked for your opinion on the situation. if she was going to get upset at you disagreeing and saying she was out of line then she should not have asked for your opinion. \n\nsecond of all, i agree with you op. what polly did was out of line. she should have asked this client permission if she could post the photo on social media, but failed to do so. in general, even if she covers their faces so no one would know, she should still ask them anyways before posting photos since not everyone likes to be posted to social media anyways.", "NTA.  She should understand her niche clientele's requirements better.", "My orthodontist\u2019s office put my before/after pictures in calendar that was sent out to all their clients.

Get the photo down and apologize profusely, yesterday.", "> You say that Lucy is telling you Polly \"tried to correct by deleting the pictuere,\" but earlier you say \"My friend argued no one would even know it was her.\" Which is it?

It's a specialty salon that caters specifically to these clients. If these clients refuse to come because she's still there after what she did the whole salon could end up shutting down. This isn't just a few people who might be upset. It's literally the main focus of the entire salon, it's their brand. There are roughly 20,000 muslims around where I live and this is the only salon in the Area that caters to them. They could lose that entire clientele over this because it's considered such a huge violation. And that is assuming the Orthodox clientele stayed which they likely wouldn't because they couldn't trust the salon anymore either.", "Edgelord alert!!!", "I didn't say anything at all until she expressly asked me what I thought about the situation.

Pictures that didn\u2019t include my face or any intimate body parts. He was very clear that I could decline either or both. This guy was more considerate of my scantily-clad, shameless heathen ass\u2019s privacy than Polly was for a woman whose religious practices she claimed to understand and respect.", "If it were a mistake or misunderstanding, Polly would have immediately apologized and taken down the photo.

Her hair is something that's supposed to stay concealed from the view of men, as part of her devotion to her god.\n\nThis is what I was thinking.

Like we agree on a principle, then the specifics shouldn\u2019t matter. If I\u2019m saying I should be doing this out of principle I can\u2019t then go and negotiate the reality.
