This time my dad did actually get involved and said from now on I need to wash my own underwear and they will get me a separate washing basket just for my underwear. I refused and they said if I don\u2019t comply I will be kicked out the house. \n\nFor some information, I don\u2019t wear any \u201csexy\u201d underwear.

They want everyone\u2019s washing to be washed at the same time EXCEPT my underwear and my underwear only. It\u2019s not up for debate me doing my own laundry, they don\u2019t want me to and i contribute to the house in other ways. Even if I wanted to I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to as my parents are stingy about water and electricity.\n\nEdit 2: no dirty underwear is touched.

I don't really understand the other votes. I'd get it if they asked you to do your own laundry as a whole.

It's not weird, even though she definitely has much more \"sexy\" underwear and mine is very normal. Even now that I'm an adult. The fact that your father's willingness to wash your laundry including your underwear now that you're an adult has weird implications in my opinion.\n\nAt this point, I'd just do my own laundry if I was you.

Sometimes when you go to grab a handful of clothes for the laundry and your hand falls on that part of the underwear and it's not yours, it's gross. I know because I have two daughters (teenager and tween on the cusp of getting her first period) and wash their clothes with ours (for environmental purposes).~~\n\n~~It's not sexual on your dad's part, it's just kind of icky to touch someone else's dirty undies.

I am also an adult living at my parents house, and used to do my laundry separately until my mom told me to stop and she would do it with the rest since it\u2019s a waste of water and electricity. I still help with it, but it is done altogether. By OPs post, the issue is not that OP refuses to do laundry or doesn\u2019t know how, it\u2019s that OPs underwear is somehow uncomfortable for the father to wash, which I think is super weird.", "NTA and I feel like nobody is reading your post at all.\n\nI would be so creeped out by this request and the thought of my dad thinking about my underwear like that.

She says she doesn\u2018t something to get wrong. I know many people where the mom does the laundry and mostly because she doesn\u2018t want her kids to do it. \nI do our laundry too. I don\u2018t like my husband doing the laundry and I don\u2018t like anyone doing my laundry because everyone does it different. \n\nSo clearly the dad is the asshole for being a creep.

I agree that she should be doing her own laundry in general but if her parents do it willingly and don't mind or want her to do it herself, then just the underware shouldn't be a problem.

Idk haha.", "A 30-year-old who marries a 20-year-old is now someone who might sniff their daughter's underwear? \n\nThis kind of assumption built on assumption reasoning/storytelling is irresponsible and it\u2019s creepy as hell. \n\nYou should be more serious when you accuse someone of these kinds of abuses.

Yep, OP is the AH and should be doing her own laundry,  but the REASON for her father's request is uh, disturbing. I washed my son's underwear when he was a teen. (He did know how to do laundry, but it was cheaper to do the entire family's whites together.) It's not like you have to touch and inspect each pair. Also, the dad was OK with doing her undies when she was 13 and 16 but not now?

If they were tired of doing her laundry, they would tell her to do her laundry. They singled out the underwear and told her it was because her dad thinks it is inappropriate, not gross, not icky, inappropriate.

Dad is 100% sexualizing his daughter's underwear. That is super weird.", "I\u2019ll bet you anything that The dad is into underwear.  Thats his kink and the mom knows it as well.  Now that their daughter is the exact same age as the mother was when he got her pregnant, he\u2019s starting to have uncomfortable feelings about his daughters underwear so he wants her to keep it away from him.  Mom knows what\u2019s going on and that\u2019s why she wants the same thing.  I feel so sure that\u2019s what this is all about.", "Read her comments.

WHY??\"", "For the last fucking time please read the damn posts and responses. No one but OP touches them while they're dirty.
