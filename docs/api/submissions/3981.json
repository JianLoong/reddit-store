His family owned some 1500 acres of land, split between his father and aunt. Before we met, Chet knew he would not live in that area after his parents died but wanted a vacation home there so he bought and took ownership of 125 acres from his father with his aunt\u2019s approval. That way he would have something and his cousins could do with the rest of the land as they wanted. He built his house there and we lived there while we were together.\n\nWe weren\u2019t legally married but were considered common law by our state and he always took great care of me. He had a son from his previous relationship that he was more or less estranged from due to his son stealing great sums of money from my mother-in-law. When she was still alive his family treated me well and like I belonged. After her death, his aunt and to a degree his father shifted their stance a bit. Since we weren't married they definitely made it clear I wasn't held in the same regard as his cousins\u2019 spouses. During a discussion about what would happen with Chet\u2019s land and the estate he'd inherit from his father if he disowned his son, his aunt and dad pretty much agreed that while I'm wonderful, he should have seriously considered the fact I didn't want children before getting into a relationship with me. \n\nAfter that Chet didn\u2019t speak with his dad for about a year. We did discuss how he missed his dad and I told him he should continue having a relationship with his dad if he wanted- he stood up for me when it mattered. While he did have a relationship with them again, he changed his life insurance through his employer so that I\u2019d be the sole beneficiary and asked that I give a portion of it to his son so he didn\u2019t get left with nothing. He also updated his will, had a no-contest clause added, left his land, house, and a couple of other things to me, and the rest to his surviving family members. He did tell his family about this.\n\nWhen he died everything transferred as he planned. I tried to continue living in our home but between memories and his family not really interacting with me anymore, I wanted to move back closer to my family. I sold the house and land to one of Chet\u2019s former coworkers and his family and left. When his family found out they were upset and insisted I should have given them the chance to buy it first since their family had owned it first. I\u2019ve tried talking to my family about it since I moved back and I\u2019m getting mixed reactions. I know it\u2019s too late to do anything aside from possibly giving a portion of the sale to them.

It would have been nice if you gave them the first opportunity to buy the land back, as they may have wanted to take it back.  And assuming they were willing to pay fair market value, that would be the logical thing to do.\n\nSo, I also think it's fair they are upset/annoyed about it - as long as it stops there.  (of course, if they are harassing/bothering you about it beyond that - that would be different).\n\nBut at the same time, I'm not going to call you TA as it just doesn't sound like something that crossed your mind.  There was no malice, nor ill intent.  You just never considered that.\n\nPeople are allowed to be upset over something - without being TA.

Sounds like they have enough land anyway. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA. It would have been considerate to offer the family a chance to buy the land back, but it was your land to do what you wanted with.", "NTA You could have offered it to them first since they owned, presumably, the land right around it.  You didn\u2019t have to.  It would have been kind.", "NTA - but I think it would have been considerate to ask them first because you knew it was family land.  So just slightly rude is maybe what I would call you.", "NTA. It might have been generous of you to them first refusal to buy the land but if they\u2019d bothered to talk with you once in a while they\u2019d have known you were interested in selling.

I'm surprised it didn't occur to you to make the offer - never shit on the trail behind you and all that.", "NTA. It was your land, you had the right to do with it as you saw fit. Maybe if they hadn't spent years souring their relationship with you they might have gotten first dibs.", "NTA\n\nIt became your land and property to do what you like with in line with your husband's wishes.", "NTA\n\nBased on your narrative, the family knew that you had been willing the land. \n\nThey could have approached you and said that if you ever wanted to sell the land, they would be interested\n\nThere is no indication that ownership of a very small amount of land and a house built by OP's husband negatively impacts the rest of the family. This wasn't a family home which held family memories but one that had been built by OP's husband. And there is so much land that the family retains ownership of that it is hard to imagine that ownership of the land by a third party impacts them in any kind of way.", "NTA. Legally the house was yours by inheritance. The family can be mad all they want but they now have new neighbors and will need to respect that they no longer own that segment. It was yours to do ad you wanted.

Offering it to them first would have been a considerate thing to do, but sometimes it just slips our minds. It would be different if you knew they wanted it and you refused to sell to them, or if they knew you were selling and expected you to just give it to them.

Everyone saying that you can legally do what you want is missing the point of this whole sub.\n\nGiving them a portion of the sale shouldn\u2019t help, and won\u2019t change anything since they really just wanted to keep it in the family.

You don't owe them anything from the sale, either.", "NTA: your husband updated his life insurance and his will so that everything would transfer to you. I\u2019m going to presume there was never a conversation between you and him regarding the inheritance if you didn\u2019t want to remain on the land after his passing. If he wanted the land to go back to them, I\u2019m sure he would have said something to you when he made all these changes. He wanted to be sure you were provided for and it sounds like he really thought through it all so I don\u2019t think he would have assumed you would know to offer to sell them the land back if you decided to not stay. He would have made sure to talk to you about that so I\u2019m thinking he didn\u2019t really care if the land stayed in the family or not. So, if he didn\u2019t care, you shouldn\u2019t either! You had plenty of other things on your mind and maybe had they truly treated you with an ounce of respect after his death, they would have known you weren\u2019t happy there and wanted to sell and could have offered you FMV and gotten the land they seem to desperately want. DO NOT give them any money. Your husband was ensuring you would be taken care of after his death so it\u2019s yours! Sorry for your loss OP and best wishes on this new journey!", "Esh. They were garbage for they treated you. However given that it was family land (a family you were apart of even if they didn't acknowledge that) I do think the right thing to do was give the family the opportunity to buy it from you at full market value. However I do have to point out that if they kept in touch with you they would have known you wanted to sell. So your TA is very small compared to the huge TAs they are.", "Torn but going ESH. Even though they treated you well while Chet was alive it's not cool they didn't consider you fully family. Whether you like it or not for many people still that legal document of a marriage certificate still holds much weight in how you are treated in a family. You knew this was family land and the fact you didn't even give them 1st refusal at market value was spiteful and you know it. That's why you have mixed feelings about it now.", "NTA. They weren\u2019t interacting with you, but if they really wanted to buy the land, they could\u2019ve contacted you thru the attorney. They should\u2019ve thought about the possibility that you would no longer want to live there and acted accordingly.", "NTA and they are not entitled to any of the proceeds from the sale.  Your husband made his wishes about his  estate very clear.  Furthermore, even if you did give them something it would not change how they feel about you and treat you.   \n\n\nPerhaps it would have been thoughtful of you to offer some sort of right of first refusal to your in-laws, but the property was yours to do with as you wish.  I also get the sense the family would have expected to pay you less than fair market value for the property which would have made an already emotional situation more difficult for you.  Again, they aren\u2019t entitled to any financial benefit from your husband\u2019s estate.", "YTA \nI\u2019d say you just proved their point. This is why they wanted to have offspring (obviously not his son) or someone who would care about the land. You could have given them the chance to buy it back but you didn\u2019t out of spite. It\u2019s just one phone call from your realtor to match an offer.\n\nI will say if they thought they deserved it free or wanted a discount then you\u2019re NTA. But if it\u2019s not about money and they just want the family land to be owned by someone who wants to be there. Then I side with them, given it\u2019s next to impossible to get that land back.", "YTA. Backstory is irrelevant technically HOWEVER it seems salient info because you likely did what you did out of spite.  You\u2019re legally in the clear of course\u2026but I think knowing it was a parcel of a very large family owned property, most anyone would have offered \u2018right of first refusal\u2019 here, and also of course as long as they were willing to pay the prevailing price.   \n\nYou never gave them a chance.  Is it all the cousins fault aunt and dad treated you as less than?  Now their family acreage has a stranger right in the middle of it.  They might\u2019ve wanted their kids etc to keep it within the family.", "YTA-it was family land, would have been the decent thing to do to offer it to family first.", "Yes YTA.

Also, I have a feeling they would have tried to strong arm you into taking way less than what the property was worth.\n\nTo those saying OP is TA, maybe you have some family land that's really important to you, so you see it more from the other perspective, but I have no such experience. However, I would like you to consider the following:\nA) Former family-in-law almost definitely would have tried to bully OP into a bad deal.\nB) Chet obviously wanted to keep the land from his family, or he would have made some kind of provision for them to get it back upon OP's death or something stating they had the first right of purchase should OP sell.\nC) We're taking about less than 10% of a massive amount of land.\nD) Most importantly, people are more important than things, and Chet's family did not treat OP well as a person and seem to care more about this property than someone who was in their family for 14 years.", "Could you have given them first right if refusal? Yes. Were you obligated to? No. Given the state of your husband\u2019s and your relationship with his family at the time of his death it is quite understandable things turned out the way they did. If your husband wanted them to have the property he could have left it to them or stated that should you not want the property, or pass away yourself, they would get first right of refusal. But he didn\u2019t do that. He left it all to you. You weren\u2019t even legally obligated to share the life insurance with his son because he made you sole beneficiary, but because he asked you to you did share with his son. When he filled out the life insurance paperwork he could have split the policy however he wanted to (I.e. give you 90% and his son 5% and his favorite charity 5%). But he made you sole beneficiary and verbally asked you to give his son a portion. If his family want the property they can approach the new owners themselves. Again, you were under no obligation to offer it to them. Given the state of your relationship I\u2019m sure they would have lowballed you and try to bully you into accepting their offer because they are \u201cfamily\u201d.
