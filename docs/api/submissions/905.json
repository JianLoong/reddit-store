As I said, I had pancreatitis once, but for 6 months straight when I was 15 I was in and out of the ER with yellow bloody stool, nausea, horrible stomach pains that left me curled in a ball crying.

For the past 4 years I\u2019ve learned to deal with my stomach issues.

All I ask of her is to pay at least some of the copay and bills and take me to the appointments that I will make.

Or even your stepdad?", "NTA i guess you are in the USA? But you have insurance through your dad isn't it? Just go to the doctor, if she was a decent human being she'd help you but you are an adult now and you have to do what's best for you. Don't wait around.", "NTA I can't imagine how it must feel battling those types of health issues while maintaining employment and trying to lead a full life at 19. Asking for a ride or help with a bill is not farfetched and I'm baffled trying to figure out what's your mom's issue with contributing. Why did she tell you it's all in your head? Because of previous failed attempts to diagnose the issue? At the very least she can offer emotional support and doesn't sound like she's doing that either", "NTA- sorry but she is likely not going to help since she hasn't helped since last 4 years. So don't waste your time expecting her help and find some other family memebers who can help you.Hope you feel better soon.", "Have you simply asked your mother if she would pay for appointments ?\nHave you asked your father if he would ?\n\nDo you drive ? How do you get to work ?\n\nDon't expect people to pay/do things for you, but ask for help when you need it. \n\nWhat does your primary doctor have to say about all of this ?", "It's not about being unfair by expecting her to do this for you. It's about being an adult which you legally are.\n\nShould you mother help you out ? Yes. But the reality is, she is not and doesn't even want to, so time to grow up and take care of things of yourself. \n\nStop waiting for your mother to do things for you when you know she won't since she hasn't for the past 4 years.", "Nta - do you also suffer from depression?\n\nI do and I tend to have stomach issues when I am in a low state.", "NTA definitely. Even though you're technically an adult now, your mom should care way more about your health than she does, especially considering your father's family's health history.\n\nI'm 28, and my mom has been begging me to go to the dentist, even offering to pay for me, because she cares. \n\nI'm truly sorry that your mom is acting the way she is, you deserve better.", "NTA. She should absolutely be more concerned than she is. Gallbladders need to be taken out from time to time, I'm not aware of any genetic factors there, but Crohn's absolutely can be. With that family history, plus your symptoms, you really need to get a full diagnosis.", "NTA, but you\u2019re an adult now legally. You can take yourself to the doctor.

Your mum should have dealt with this when you first started having symptoms. That is negligence. Why did your mum have you if she wasn't going to properly take care of you? You didn't ask to be born. Even though you are an adult, I think your mother should still be helping you out until you are stable on your own. Shitty parents abandon their kids once they turn 18. And your mum sounds like a shitty parent. Having a child is a lifetime commitment. I'd suggest saving and paying for your own medical care. It's clear your mum doesn't care.", "If OP has to get a colonoscopy and she is not 50+ this is insurance approved but is not considered preventative.  The cost will go towards the the deductible and OP will need to check how much this is.  For our insurance we pay copays of $20 but for the colonoscopy for the person less than 50 we owed $2500 and it was due up front.", "Nta. Just as an fyi if you're in the US all public hospitals have a financial assistance program that can help pay your medical bills whether your uninsured or underinsured. Make sure to include a note that explains your mother's medical neglect in your younger years and her being unwilling to help you pay for the bills yourself. They can also probably direct you to services in your area who can help you get to your appointments if you have no way to get there", "NTA but real talk here: do you have a copy of your insurance card? If not, ask your dad to send you one. You can walk into a Dr office with a scanned digital copy as well. You have some spare pocket money. Use it to pay your copays if your mom won\u2019t help. Ask your dad if you\u2019re eligible to be seen any special kind of hospitals due to his insurance - they may be cheaper\n\nMake an appt to see a specialist. Get the testing done. Yes your mother should be willing to help. Your dad should be following up and making appts for you if your mother isn\u2019t willing, but if they won\u2019t, you need to. Please do.\n\nIf your dad were posting, I\u2019d encourage him to see if you\u2019re eligible to be considered a dependent due to your medical issues, despite being 19, and then seek to modify custody so he can care for you.", "ESH. Your mother for not taking it seriously while you where a minor and you now, as an adult expecting your parents to pay. You said you\u2019re on your dad\u2019s health insurance with a co pay of less than $100. You\u2019re 19. You work. There is literally nothing stopping you from making these appointments, going and paying yourself. You\u2019re an adult. \n\nYou need to see a health professional to get a colonscopy done and blood work to check for things like cealiac, crohns, UC and cancer. Stop waiting for your parents to agree. Make the appointments today.", "I think the problem is growing up with a negligent parent means OP doesn't know where to start with dealing with her own medical issues. Even legal adults want help and advice too. Especially if OP is American and the insurance system is traaaaash.", "She still has a father...\n\nThere are social workers.\n\nThere are sites like Reddit.", "She left her father, who apparently also hasn't stepped in since she needed medical assistance years ago...\n\nI wouldn't know what sub in reddit may actually be helpful towards navigating health issues. It's not this one."]}
