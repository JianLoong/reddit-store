One should never ask a question if they don't want the answer to it.  You are right - support from any gov. is limited and meant to be short term - not long term have as many kids as you like and someone else will pay for it.  \n\nI get accidents - had 3 - love them to death - best thing that ever happened to me.  I never planned them, but I could not see myself without them.  But she is planning this and actively sabotaging herself and she is not working towards a sustainable solution.  If she thinks it is bad now - imagine when she has the second - hopefully she waits for a 3rd until they are employed.  Because state money is not going to keep covering kids and adults when there are 2 adults, and neither are working.  Some programs actively limit money and reduce it after so long when the adults are not working.  Gov. programs are not meant to be long term nor to support 2 able bodied adults who are avoiding entering other types of work because they don't like them.

If they worked and still couldn\u2019t afford it, sure.", "She asked if she could get it through their health insurance and they said no.  They didn\u2019t even know she was sexually active. She told her mom her periods were horrendous and making it hard for her to study sometimes (this was partially true -they were erratic and extremely painful). Her mom was willfully ignorant about the sexual activity stuff (I think she assumed we wanted to start having sex but didn\u2019t want to think about that) and tried advocating for it with her dad.  Her dad accused her of lying so she could just have sex.  So that avenue died there.  \n\nI offered to pay for it out of pocket (iirc it was about $40/mo) but she was afraid of getting it in the mail over the Summer or her parents finding out some other way and kicking her out or cutting her off. Her grandmother was paying for her college.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a great situation.", "It would also be great if a woman can walk down a dark alley at night an not get assaulted. Or if I could leave my life savings in cash on the hood of my car while I\u2019m out eating.\n\nUnfortunately we don\u2019t live in that world. We also don\u2019t live in the world where artificial birth control is available to everyone.\n\nAbstinence is available to everyone in a consensual relationship. It is available to the people who are the topic of this post.  They should practice it until they are able to afford children.", "The people discussed in this story are making the pro-active choice to refuse to use birth control when they can't afford another kid just because they selfishly want one.\n\nIt's like the exact opposite of the situation you're describing.", "I do have access to birth control. I wish every women in the world had access to birth control and could decide what they want to do with their own body. \n\nBut that's not the world we live in. So when you don't have access to birth control, then just don't have sex if you can't afford a kid.", "Yeah right. Let\u2019s leave it at that. A child\u2019s well-being should be everyone\u2019s interest. Too much cultural differences here", "You can debate this all you want, but what I know is if my wife and I\u2019s child didn\u2019t have a bed I\u2019d find a damn way to buy a bed. \n\nThat\u2019s the cultural difference I suppose. Neither are working.", "Good for you. I am not going to debate any further with you.", "Why should it be on everyone else for people making bad decisions?"]}
