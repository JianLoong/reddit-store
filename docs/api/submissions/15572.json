Let your friends financially support her if they choose but you are absolutely right in what you said to her.", "NTA.\n\nBirth control is a lot cheaper than a kid.", "NTA. So she\u2019s complaining about money and how they can\u2019t afford this or that but decided to get pregnant again ?? She sounds like a complete idiot", "NTA - she asked, you answered.", "NTA. People like her just want to stay miserable. She was likely fishing for free shit. My wife has a friend like that. All she wants to do is complain and when my wife gives her reasonable things to do to rectify her situation, she does nothing to change. It gets exhausting listening to someone complain about something so much but they do nothing to improve their situation; they only make it worse. You did nothing wrong. Her and her husband are lazy and just want to take and not put back in.", "NTA...she clearly needed a dose of truth and common sense. Your other friends are doing her no favours.", "Unemployed and have another child - hold your hand out to the government. Try that with your employer. NTA.", "NTA, people that intentionally have kids when they cannot support themselves are selfish and stupid.", "NTA. You can\u2019t count on government support to raise a family. It\u2019s there for unforeseen circumstances - not planned growth - and if they don\u2019t have enough to raise one child on welfare it\u2019s certain it won\u2019t be enough with two children. It would be far worse if you didn\u2019t try to warn her of the situation where there are two children who aren\u2019t adequately provided for.", "NTA. \n\nIf somebody is continually talking about their issues to a group of people, they are asking for insights / feedback on said issues. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re not wrong.", "This is the hill I am willing to die on.. You are totally right and NTA.", "NTA - You did the right thing. She needed someone to tell her the truth. She and her husband are f,,ck ups, and she was looking for her friends to cosign their loserdom.\n\nAlso, it sounds like she was boring.", "NTA.\n\nIf she can't afford to properly care for one baby, how does she think she's magically going to afford two?", "NTA those poor kids going to suffer.", "NTA, someone needed to say it.", "NTA there are 2 able bodied people in the family that could get a job. If she doesn\u2019t have enough money she should get work not complain about something she has control over. She doesn\u2019t sound like someone who even cares about the child she already has.\n\nShe probably wanted all of you to throw her a baby shower or offer to buy a new crib for her.", "NTA\n\nThe husband needs to be working. For him to be unemployed during what was the largest hiring boom in our country\u2019s history, while having dependents, is not okay.", "NTA. You spoke the truth no apology needed. Is your friend first or second generation living on handouts. The more kids you have the more money you get. Depending on the area you live in.", "NTA. I believe in a strong, supportive welfare state and I believe that in the US (where I assume you are), there is nowhere near the safety net that we should actually have. There is so much more that can and should be done, and in an abstract sense, yeah, sure, the government could do more to support parents (whether employed or not!).\n\nBut this isn't some political theory discussion. It is the real world. If you can't afford to have children, sure, some happen despite your best efforts but they were literally trying for one, and that is just complerely irresponsible. She made her bed and she can lie on it.", "NAH. It really grinds my gears when people have an expectation that someone else with deal with a problem that they have created! The husband should get a job, ANY job to provide for the family and the fact that they have decided to have another child when they cannot provide for the one they\u2019ve got is ridiculous. I would distance myself from them and let them wallow in the mess that they have created", "NTA.. part of baby planning is planning for the finances. \"Taxpayers should pay for me,\" is not a plan. Can't say she planned to have another one if they didn't do any actual planning. And what shitty parents to bring kids into a situation where they can't even take care of themselves.", "NTA. You told her the truth. I have zero time for over-entitled people. Don't have additional children, when you cannot support the one you have already. It's not a hard concept to grasp.", "NTA. The government should provide a safety net as one of their duties but she has no right to complain having chosen her situation.", "NTA, while I do agree with her that the government should cover. You are right, it\u2019s not the government but society should provide for all of its members. I know this is a concept not really prominent in the US", "YTA, educating the weak is only prolonging their pain.

It\u2019s incredibly selfish to have a second child in those circonstances!", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if she got accidentally pregnant and was freaking out about how to make it work\u2026but she actually chose to get pregnant knowing she couldn\u2019t afford it?

Sarah\u2019s husband hasn\u2019t worked and Sarah doesn\u2019t work.\n\nNot every family can afford to have a stay at home mom. Sarah needs to recognize that the families that typically have a stay at home parent are ones that have throughly planned pregnancies.

It\u2019s a matter of self sustained growth. \n\nAt least where I live this is pretty much the case, I know the US sees things differently when it comes to welfare", "This neglects the point that Sarah and her husband are both not working. That\u2019s ridiculous.

At least the mother can stay home with her child on state support for up to three years. They can return to work earlier if they want to and will be provided free childcare for as long as they are not employed where I come from. \n\nExpecting a child has a real bed is already upper class America? Damn that\u2019s really sad tbh"]}
