I don't think you said anything wrong.\n\nIt's OK to be sympathetic, but there also has to be realism. Sure there's some bad luck with covid and the business going under, but then why would you jump on creating another child when you don't have resources to care for the first one?

One should never ask a question if they don't want the answer to it.  You are right - support from any gov. is limited and meant to be short term - not long term have as many kids as you like and someone else will pay for it.  \n\nI get accidents - had 3 - love them to death - best thing that ever happened to me.  I never planned them, but I could not see myself without them.  But she is planning this and actively sabotaging herself and she is not working towards a sustainable solution.  If she thinks it is bad now - imagine when she has the second - hopefully she waits for a 3rd until they are employed.  Because state money is not going to keep covering kids and adults when there are 2 adults, and neither are working.  Some programs actively limit money and reduce it after so long when the adults are not working.  Gov. programs are not meant to be long term nor to support 2 able bodied adults who are avoiding entering other types of work because they don't like them.
