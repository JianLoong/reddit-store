About twenty minutes after takeoff, I hear Luna start fussing with her mom about something, but I turn up the volume on my headphones.

She said so\n\nMe: it\u2019s my tablet, not your mom\u2019s. She can\u2019t make me give it to you like she can with Oliver. Now leave me alone.\n\nI then put my headphones back on and turn up the volume again, drowning out any more whining. \n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my dad taps me on the shoulder and asks if my episode is done yet because my cousins are getting pretty noisy and my aunt needs a break. I can definitely hear the both of them whining and borderline yelling at my aunt that they\u2019re bored. \n\n(Here\u2019s where I might be TA) I decide that I want to keep watching my show and that entertaining my cousins isn\u2019t my job. I say that if Luna can ask nicely, she and Oliver can play for ten minutes, knowing full well that Luna won\u2019t ask nicely because she\u2019s spoiled. \n\nJen: hey Luna, ask [my name] nicely if you can play\n\nLuna: [my name] can I play? \n\nMe: what\u2019s the magic word? \n\nLuna: give it! \n\nMe: sorry, that\u2019s not the magic word, I guess you don\u2019t get to play. \n\nI put my headphones back on and turn the volume back up, keeping it that way for the east if the flight, save for the few times my parents asked me to give my cousins another chance, to which I said no. \n\nAfter the flight, my mom said that what I did was petty, and that I made things unnecessarily difficult for my aunt on the flight.

Let me guess, you would understand his frustration but would also feel embarrassed because it probably is just a tablet and well they are kids and aunt is probably sorry but he should understand it is an accident and as such should understand that he should not be asking for compensation and such because now he made the rest of the trip a lot harder on aunt who now has to reach in to her fun time fund she saved up for her and the kids on this trip ? \n\nI agree with the rest but OP handled it perfectly and even if he just simply answered the first time they asked with a simple \"no\" would have also been fine. \n\nThe mother/father/aunt can all before the return flight or whatever go download games and movies on their phone if they have so much of a problem with the aunts piss poor planning on her end to make the flight easier for herself.", "Reported\n\nR/DdingFit9 stole this comment from r/Puzzlehump1", "I mean, the husband and I are full on white haired oldies, and we still make sure to bring entertainment for us.", "What you did was in no way petty; it was simply the most reasonable response to an unreasonable demand.", "NTA, you have her a chance to ask nicely.
