The people on the trip are: Me, my parents, my aunt Jen, and my cousins Oliver (9) and Luna (6). \n\nMy mom is super airline-savvy, so she managed to get us all seated together in a line; me and my parents on one side of the isle, and my aunt and cousins directly across from us. \n\nAnyway, I brought my tablet (which I bought with my own money)on the flight so I could watch Netflix as it was a pretty long flight. About twenty minutes after takeoff, I hear Luna start fussing with her mom about something, but I turn up the volume on my headphones. Then I feel a tap on my shoulder from Luna who has the isle seat (I\u2019m also in the isle seat). (Dialogue is rough since my memory isn\u2019t the best). \n\nLuna: Hey mommy said I can play on your tablet, give me it\n\nMe: No, I\u2019m using it right now. Maybe if you ask nicely when I\u2019m done with my episode. \n\nLuna: but she said I could! \n\nMe: I don\u2019t care \n\nLuna: *huff* Mommy, I can play with [my name]\u2019s tablet right? \n\nJen: that\u2019s right honey\n\nLuna: see? She said so\n\nMe: it\u2019s my tablet, not your mom\u2019s. She can\u2019t make me give it to you like she can with Oliver. Now leave me alone.\n\nI then put my headphones back on and turn up the volume again, drowning out any more whining. \n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my dad taps me on the shoulder and asks if my episode is done yet because my cousins are getting pretty noisy and my aunt needs a break. I can definitely hear the both of them whining and borderline yelling at my aunt that they\u2019re bored. \n\n(Here\u2019s where I might be TA) I decide that I want to keep watching my show and that entertaining my cousins isn\u2019t my job. I say that if Luna can ask nicely, she and Oliver can play for ten minutes, knowing full well that Luna won\u2019t ask nicely because she\u2019s spoiled. \n\nJen: hey Luna, ask [my name] nicely if you can play\n\nLuna: [my name] can I play? \n\nMe: what\u2019s the magic word? \n\nLuna: give it! \n\nMe: sorry, that\u2019s not the magic word, I guess you don\u2019t get to play. \n\nI put my headphones back on and turn the volume back up, keeping it that way for the east if the flight, save for the few times my parents asked me to give my cousins another chance, to which I said no. \n\nAfter the flight, my mom said that what I did was petty, and that I made things unnecessarily difficult for my aunt on the flight.

Good on you for showing them their tactics don't work.", "NTA.  Your aunt needs to make plans for entertaining her own children that don't involve other peoples' things.

It was nice to even give them a chance even knowing the outcome. \n\nI\u2019m a mom and on flights I plan a carry on that is strictly toys, tablet, books, etc. Just to keep my daughter busy because she\u2019s MY daughter.

Also, she was being rude.", "NTA and your parents can stfu along with your aunt and her heathen kids. You paid for it, it\u2019s your property to do what you want with. Your aunt should have planned on entertainment for her own children. This reminds me of a quote I love \u2018Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine\u2019.

Edited for spelling", "NTA in the slightest. Nobody has the right to give permission to somebody else to use *your* property.\n\nYour aunt has the responsibility to provide for the entertainment of her child. She ignored and badly flubbed that responsibility. This is in no way your problem.\n\nIf your aunt did get her way, what were you supposed to do for the rest of the flight? She's clearly TA in all ways in this whole scenario.\n\nETA:\n\nYour parents should not be enabling your aunt's ~~sh~~ bad behavior and lack of parenting. What you did was in no way petty; it was simply the most reasonable response to an unreasonable demand.", "NTA\n\nYou had every right to decide who would use your property and set rules for sharing it. If you had shared it, you likely would not have been given it back for the rest of the flight and possibly for your whole vacation.\n\nYour aunt is a fool. Not parenting your children when they are young makes it incredibly harder to parent them as they age. Even most  toddlers can say please and thank you and sorry. \n\nYour whole family was there. Are they not familiar with your aunt's choosing not to parent? They had nothing with them to amuse your cousins? Your parents chose not to help your aunt and your cousins, and blame you for doing no more than all the adults? They could easily have engaged the children by telling stories, or playing games like \"I spy\", or memory games like laying out a series of items, covering them, and then listing what they remember.", "NTA.
