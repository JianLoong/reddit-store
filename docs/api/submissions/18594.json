I grew up in a home where my mother was more concerned about being an alcoholic and getting smashed for the day than raising us.  One of my younger brothers got accustomed real fast to being the squeaky wheel that gets the grease every damned time because she found it easier to shut him up than to get him to quit acting entitled to everything he wanted.  As I got closer to OP's age, this is exactly the kind of shit I started resorting to as well.  Make it more annoying trying to get you to cave in than it is to tell the kid to knock it the hell off and quit being so entitled.\n\nOn an upnote, that brother of mine is a pretty damned good salesman now that we're all adults because he's used to just poking and prodding and being annoyingly tenacious until he gets what he wanted lol.", "NTA, but maybe you could have given Luna some more chances to learn, like giving her the chance to ask nicely after each episode.

You keep kids occupied. It's a ballache to sit on a plane for 8 hours as an adult - that seems like an eternity to a small child. Deffo up to the parents to keep tabs on the kids on the flight. I've even got an old slightly cracked but usable phone we dubbed the 'potatoe' phone for their use during a flight with predownloaded videos etc (at 4 they don't get a full time device in our household). \n\nThat being said, at 16, you're a bit older and have a bit more patience.
