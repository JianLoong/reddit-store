About twenty minutes after takeoff, I hear Luna start fussing with her mom about something, but I turn up the volume on my headphones. Then I feel a tap on my shoulder from Luna who has the aisle seat (I\u2019m also in the aisle seat). (Dialogue is rough since my memory isn\u2019t the best). \n\nLuna: Hey mommy said I can play on your tablet, give me it\n\nMe: No, I\u2019m using it right now. Maybe if you ask nicely when I\u2019m done with my episode. \n\nLuna: but she said I could! \n\nMe: I don\u2019t care \n\nLuna: *huff* Mommy, I can play with [my name]\u2019s tablet right? \n\nJen: that\u2019s right honey\n\nLuna: see? She said so\n\nMe: it\u2019s my tablet, not your mom\u2019s. She can\u2019t make me give it to you like she can with Oliver. Now leave me alone.\n\nI then put my headphones back on and turn up the volume again, drowning out any more whining. \n\nAbout twenty minutes later, my dad taps me on the shoulder and asks if my episode is done yet because my cousins are getting pretty noisy and my aunt needs a break. I can definitely hear the both of them whining and borderline yelling at my aunt that they\u2019re bored. \n\n(Here\u2019s where I might be TA) I decide that I want to keep watching my show and that entertaining my cousins isn\u2019t my job. I say that if Luna can ask nicely, she and Oliver can play for ten minutes, knowing full well that Luna won\u2019t ask nicely because she\u2019s spoiled. \n\nJen: hey Luna, ask [my name] nicely if you can play\n\nLuna: [my name] can I play? \n\nMe: what\u2019s the magic word? \n\nLuna: give it! \n\nMe: sorry, that\u2019s not the magic word, I guess you don\u2019t get to play. \n\nI put my headphones back on and turn the volume back up, keeping it that way for the east if the flight, save for the few times my parents asked me to give my cousins another chance, to which I said no. \n\nAfter the flight, my mom said that what I did was petty, and that I made things unnecessarily difficult for my aunt on the flight. I know what I did was petty, but does it make me an AH?\n\nETA: there were screens on the back of the seats, and my cousins did play with them for a little while, but then they got bored which is when Luna asked me the first time\n\nMy aunt did bring some toys and games, but my cousins were already in a frenzy before she could get them from her bag, also they have such low attention spans I doubt it would have helped.

The rest of the world will see them as entitled little shits being enabled by adults, that will grow into entitled assholes. If your parents put up some boundaries with your aunt and uncle instead of completely rolling over, maybe it wouldve helped their niblings. They are also doing a disservice by adding themselves to the list of people who your cousins can go to to get their way, instead of adding themselves to the list of people who could be an example to them on how they really should be acting with others. Nobody is required to be nice to a child to the point of catering to them, except sometimes their parents. SOMETIMES. NOT when they are being entitled little shits. When they need support and comfort from something bad happening, thats when they need catering to. Not at every whim. Theyre young enough maybe they have a chance if your aunt and uncle ever dug their heads out ofntheir asses and wanted to put in the work to raise their kids to be decent human beings. And if they didnt want to put in the work of explaining every single time why its nicer to do this rather than what they did, they shouldnt have become parents! \n\nAnd using this situation as an example for what i said your aunt and uncle should be putting in the work to raise decent human beings: That belongs to OP so youll have to ask her. If OP says no, you can do one of a or b that i have packed for you for the trip, we have all kinds of things packed for you to do, petname. Parenting is hard when you dont like it, its still their responsibility to do it. You never know who your kids will become, but it is always your job to do your best by them in giving them the best possible chance at success of being a decent and successful human being. Teaching them how to interact with the world and live a good life in it on their own, how to be considerate and respectful of others, its all things we need to be taught and our parents are there to teach it to us, or should be . (Mine werent but they also didnt allow me to ever feel entitled, things were earned or given because i was repectful or another normal circumstance. I was taught how to be a decent human to others even though they werent always there for me.)  I do have to say, im a new mom and i was appauled by your aunts willingness to allow her children to be entitled. We learn throuhh extended family how to treat other people later in life, they will treat others as theyve treated you unless they show them otherwise. If they move out and get that reality check themselves, theyre likely to either want to live with their parents where they get what they want, or they will go through the very difficult job of re-training their own brains to then be a decent human being and a functioning member of society. If they have to do the ladder, theres a very real and large chance that they will not hear from that child often anymore, if at all. If my parents turned me into an asshole my entire life, and then i had that relaisation from a stranger after being an asshole to them because i felt it was normal to get what i want, i think id never talk to the people who raised me to be an a hole ever again.

Not petty at all.  \n\n\nNot the 16 year old's job to entertain someone else's children. Especially with electronics she bought and paid for himself. And not the aunt's place to demand he hand over his property to her children.", "But then what would OP do? Should he be bored on the trip just because his aunt didn\u2019t bring stuff for the kids?", "If this family is like mine, this comment would just cause a larger fight\u2026 \n\nUnfortunately, this comment works with families that respect boundaries.", "I get the feeling he wouldn\u2019t have gotten it back until the got home from their vacation.", "My kids are 11 and 13.  We travel often.  I still make sure everyone has tablets, books, and headphones before we leave the house.  Planes can be fun for kids, but you have to make sure they are entertained.", "My parents were the masters of keeping us entertained on long trips. And I\u2019m in my 30s, so this was before tablets and seat back TVs. They always had a couple of new toys or books on hand to surprise us for trips and keep us entertained in addition to some of our old faves. I totally know kids are hard but like\u2026HOW is your solution that your nephew is going to provide a tablet? Lol", "I flew a lot when I was 5-10 ish, Arizona to Michigan and back. We didn't have tablets or smartphones, and I somehow managed to not drive everyone nuts. This was pre-9/11 though so they didn't blink twice at me bringing on modeling clay or crafts.", "Yup, as army brats, my sister and I have been flying regularly since we were tiny (regularly visiting family). We regularly flew unaccompanied as well. My mom and extended family made certain we had entertainment like you suggest: activity books, actual books, magazines, and something we could play with. We played so many games of War during flights because that was the only 2-person card game we knew.\n\nOur biggest concern was our ears popping, especially since I had lots of ear infections as a little kid. My pediatrician suggested to my mom that some Dimetapp before we took off (gently drugging kids may have been a tad more acceptable in the 80s). My sister and I also probably annoyed the heck out of everyone around us every time we flew in to San Francisco. Planes come over the water to land, so blue is all we could see below us. We liked to pretend that we were scared and worried we were going to crash. As we were giggling throughout, I don't think we actually scared anyone else.", "I get the feeling he wouldn't have gotten it back, period.", "I'm 39 and spent a weekend in an AirBNB with my mom and sister at the beginning of May. I brought my tablet in case I wanted to watch tv, Kindle and Nintendo Switch \ud83e\udd23\n\nThere was so many electronics in that AirBNB because my mom brought her laptop, my sister and her husband also brought Switches and of course we all had phones. We grew up with my mom always packing books and stuff so we were occupied and carried that into adulthood.", "My Kindle (usually with 50 or so books on it) goes with me everywhere. I hated traveling when I was a kid and finishing a book without having a new one to read so now I make sure that will never happen.", "Hell even before screens, people struggled with boredom and needing entertainment. I would usually choose books over tv, and would always make sure I had a book with me wherever I went because sitting quietly with my own bored thoughts was a nightmare. I still read constantly, a book or on my phone, and I have no idea how to just be bored patiently. But no one saw my constant need for entertainment as bad because I was reading, it was a worthy venture, not a tv screen, so in their minds it was fine. \n\nTo be clear I'm not blaming anyone, it just goes to show even before screens, the human desire for distraction and entertainment and any escape from boredom is not really a new thing. Just maybe more prevalent now with screens and technology and a billion different tv shows at our immediate disposal.", "You make a good point, I didn\u2019t focus so much on that part bcuz OP said it himself he knew she would fail so he imo he went out of his way for her to fail but that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t even know adults who would respond that way.", "When was anything asked nicely", "well seeing how they bought it with their own money, yeah. their tablet their rules \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That was exactly where I went as well.", "No I believe this is the thought process of entitled parents", "How is not getting a tablet neglect? How is op spoiled by keeping his own property? Manner\u2019s should be taught before you even get to the first chance", "I can sure believe that!", "I drove security crazy once because they were sure I had a knife in my carryon, and I was sure I didn\u2019t. They went through the whole bag, could not find a knife, and the agent was like \u201cBut I *know* that\u2019s what I saw on the screen\u201d before reluctantly letting me go on my way. When I was unpacking, I realized I had one of those tiny keychain Swiss Army knives inside the zippered inner pocket of an extra tote bag I had rolled up among my clothes. It had probably been in that pocket for a couple of years, since I hardly ever used the bag.", "The hard part is getting a window seat to lean into so you don't end up snoring on your neighbour! \n\nUnless the neighbour is my partner, who is used to it by now (although she does still get annoyed when she is driving and I'm just catching ZZZs in the passenger seat).", "That\u2019s me. When we flew from the US to AU I remember waking up once to see a woman across the aisle slumped over. My husband, knowing that I am a sympathetic vomiter, told me to go back to sleep as she had been sick since we took off, so I curled right back up to sleep. I only know that I woke up for breakfast because they gave me the most beautiful banana that I stuck it in my bag for later - something a sweet little beagle reminded me of as we were standing in the terminal waiting for our luggage (which, in my case, didn\u2019t arrive for another week). That perfect banana went into the trash - but, I *was* allowed to pet the beagle.", "I did that too \ud83d\ude02"]}
