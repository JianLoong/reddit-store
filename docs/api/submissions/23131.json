Ever since then, my sister (41), her mother, has been very nasty and hostile towards everyone. I understand she's devastated as any feeling person would; we all are deep down, but this has been going on for way too long. My mother and I have tried everything in our power to get her to see a therapist. She simply refuses and says she's fine, yet she continues to treat us horribly. The woman acts as if we're the ones to killed her daughter, but the thing is, on my niece's note, she wrote something about not being able to handle the mental pain and pressure her mom was putting on her.\n\nA few days ago, my sister was, as usual, projecting her anger towards me, and as she was screaming at and name-calling me, I told her that it's her fault her daughter is dead, and that she needs to stop taking out her frustrations on us. Instead of going any further, she left my house and hasn't talked to me since then.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690327223, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159on8q/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_her_daughters/", "score": 279, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do wonder, what did you mean by pressure? Was your sister just giving her regular parental stuff or was she verbally and emotionally abusive to your niece? Given how cruel  she's been treating you and your mother before you said this, is it her first response to be verbally abusive and belittle people if she gets upset?", "I think this goes beyond reddits paygrade", "Heya,  this is hardcore above reddit's pay grade.", "Hard, hard YTA. \n\nYou don't have to subject yourself to sister's abuse and removing yourself from the situation would be totally reasonable. \n\nYou \"understand that she's devastated\" but think 8 *months* is too long? You have no idea. Sister sounds out of her mind with grief, which is absolutely not a pass to abuse you, and you're here going \"well *deep down* I'm devastated too.\" \n\nYou can encourage her to get help. You can cut off conversations or leave situations where she's acting abusively. You can choose to go low or no contact with her. \n\nIn absolutely no universe will you ever be remotely justified in telling her that it's her fault that her child is dead. Like, jesus christ, what are you hoping to get out of saying that, driving her past the brink too? Or compounding the suffering she's going to experience every day for the rest of her life? \n\nNothing she did or does will *ever* justify you saying those words to a grieving parent.", "Clearly your sister needs proper help. Imagine the guilt she must feel. She doesn't need a reminder about it.\n\nShe is clearly hurting and you and the family could decide to help her deal with this grief.", "YTA. I get that you are frustrated with your sister's accusations and are affected by your niece's death, but boy that is a terrible and destructive thing to say. That is not tough love, that was vindictive and meant to hurt her in the worst place possible. If you really want to help your sister get to a better place you will need be way more grace. \n\nSorry to you and your family.", "ESH.\n\nHer behavior isn't okay and nobody should have to deal with it.\n\nYou shouldn't have said what you did, and now you've made things harder for her.", "ESH.\nYour sister shouldnt have took her griefs out on you, but damn, you are even worst.\n\nSaying that's it was her fault her daughter died, it's even more cruel and disgusting than the way she's treating you and your family.\nHer daughter's letter would probably hunt her forever, but the thing is that you can't really know what happened behind the scene.\n\nYou tried to help, and being frustrated after being rejected and berated is ok.\nBut you could have said \"Fine, I'll leave you alone then. If you'll ever need our help I'll be there for you, but I can't stand to be treated like this, when your are not the only one suffering'. Then live, and let her grieve alone.\nUnfortunately, If someone doesn't want to be helped, insisting would only make them push you away more\nStepping aside can be seen as you don't love her or just want to give up, but sometimes it's the only rational solution.\n\nIf you want to still be in your sister life, I'll try to apologize and say that you'll be there for her if needed. Then, if it exist where you live, you can think of asking for a wellness check, if you see that your sister well-being is at risk.\n\nGood luck OP. I hope you'll be able to help her.", "ESH.

It takes a long time to get back to life but, at some point, you tell yourself to live with your memories and stop being angry. It took my wife much longer. It took me about two years, but it took her twenty. She\u2019s the one who gave birth. \n\nI hope your sis can find peace.", "ESH. Her grief isn\u2019t an excuse to treat you or anyone they way she is! She most definitely needs severe grief counseling especially if her daughter left a note saying what you posted. \n\nBut what you said was uncalled for, cruel, insensitive and vile honestly. I can understand your frustration at her taking this out on your or you mom, but you could of handled this without being so cruel.", "ESH. She's been abusive for an extended period of time, you understandably bubbled over and crossed a line. Honestly, going no contact is probably the best thing for the both of you.", "Nta. Someone had to tell her.", "NTA.", "Nta. Tough love maybe? Your sister is taking her pain out on her family when she needs to look at herself.

Telling her less than a year into her grieving that she\u2019s the reason her kid is dead is hardcore not ok.", "Esh, you suck for the comment she sucks for taking grieving out on you. You both need therapy", "Esh. What you said was far over the line. As for the sister, grief doesn't have a time limit but..... losing someone gives you zero right to verbally abuse those around you because you're in pain.", "Okay so. It's super fucked up to say it's her fault. It's also super fucked of HER to say it's your fault. The best reaction would probably be ignoring her and stonewalling her until she figures her shit out, if ever. It's not your problem, it's hers. I think telling her to fuck off is acceptable, but telling her it's her fault is too far. Tell her to fuck off and stop responding to her/giving her ANY attention. She has to deal with this herself, and it's not your responsibility. It's also not constructive to say it's her fault, though.\n\nA little YTA and a little NTA", "YTA.\n\nThis one is well above a random Redditor's pay grade, but your sister absolutely didn't need the reminder.

I hope everyone finds appropriate help and healing in this situation, and I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "YTA. Not even a question. Your assertion is patently false and only going to make her worse. I hope it felt good for you cuz it\u2019s all going to be shit from now on.", "ESH You need to show some empathy towards your sister. I'm sure having a child become a drug addict and commit suicide is stressful beyond belief. It's not your job to assign blame.", "That is the Elephant in the room. Needed to get brought up as I feel it might be part of the anger she displays. But YTA for the way you said it. At least at this point since she is NC she isn't using her anger directly on you. \n\nGive it time. She'll either reach a point where she comes after you for an apology or she will find a way to start dealing with the grief.  There are five general phases.

I understand your feelings about being verbally attacked by your sister, but she is going through intense grief and guilt right now. What you said was just cruel. You could have told her to back off without stooping to that level.", "Yes, you should have worded it better; but she also needed to hear it. She is definitely projecting her own insecurities because she can\u2019t face it. She definitely needs therapy; but you shouldn\u2019t have told her it was her fault because unless you can attest that she was applying too much pressure to the point that it was abuse; this was a mental illness that took her life.", "yta but you aren't at the same time, sister shouldn't be projecting her anger and grief on you but you shouldn't have said that to her", "With the title, I expected to read that your sister had gotten your daughter into hard drugs and was regularly using with her.

There is no time limit on grief - it takes however long it takes for each person.  If there was a note that directly blamed her, then she already thinks she is responsible - you didn't need to rub it in.", "YTA\nWho told you that 8 months is enough after losing a child? Wtf is your problem! Your sister needs help because she is in pain and already blames herself. She is a mother! But first, she needs you out of her life. How cruel you are. You should crawl and beg her forgiveness.", "YTA\n\nThat\u2019s so incredibly uncalled for. She is lashing out on you which isn\u2019t okay but she didn\u2019t blame her daughter\u2019s death on you. So to hurt her you blamed her daughter\u2019s death on her? So fucked up\n\nBtw it isn\u2019t uncommon for addicts to blame their inability to cope or their addiction on other people. Lack of accountability is extremely common with people who are using. \n\nAs if your sister didn\u2019t feel bad enough that she saw that note but you fucking went for the jugular because you clearly are one of those people who like to one up. You probably damaged your relationship with your sister for life and the fact that you are even asking if you\u2019re an AH shows that you lack self-awareness and are callous as fuck", "ESH. Your sister needs help. You need to stop letting her around you if you're going to snap back. You all need space and time to heal.", "You got what you wanted, why are you posting?  Yeah, YTA.  She's hurting, you know it and instead of just walking away you took it to the next level.", "Your family needs grief counseling and therapy. All of you for the grief counseling. Until you and your sister get help, stay away from her.", "I have no way of conveying just how big an AH you are.i lost my husband to a heart attack 2 years ago and my life is still a painful slog. Your sister lost her CHILD 8 months ago. Do you think she doesn't already live with enough guilt that you needed to twist the knife a little more? Family like you is why people choose to cut ties. You are her SISTER! You are her original ride-or-die and you failed her", "YTA how can this even be a post??? Eight months and it's been \"going on way too long\"???? How devoid of empathy does someone have to be? Yeah, she needs therapy, and like others have said this is above Reddit's pay grade... But she may never get it, may never get over it, may lash out at you ten years from now and you'd STILL be the AH. It's WORSE bc you're her sister. I wouldn't treat a random stranger with such callous disregard.", "Esh, her grief isn\u2019t excuse for her behavior. \n\nShe refused help. You should have lowered contact instead of letting yourself boil over.", "Best advice I ever heard was did you need to say it, was it constructive and was it kind. Your comment was none of those three. YTA.\n\nI would also add my sister has been incredibly angry and unhappy for the last four years since her husband died - to the extent of cutting his children off from their inheritance which is certainly not what he had intended - and takes her rage out on me as often as she is able as I am the youngest. I choose not to engage and only communicate with her about our elderly parents\u2019 failing health on a group WhatsApp with other siblings, besides mailing her birthday and Christmas gifts. It\u2019s within your gift to discontinue relationships which hurt you, but without poisoning things by being so unkind.", "YTA, But tbh Asshole isnt a strong enough word.", "Whoa. YTA.

This is a grieving mother who just lost her child, in her teenage years, to drug overdose, and may in fact already be dealing with feelings of blaming herself. She's broken, thoroughly.

OP went waaay too far and will never be able to take those words back, but let's not pretend the grieving mother isn't also an A H here...", "> no universe will you ever be remotely justified in telling her that it's her fault that her child is dead\n\nI mean, unless it is her fault.
