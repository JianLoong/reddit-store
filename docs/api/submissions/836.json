Back in the early 2000s when  it was new, my grandparents were gifted the car by their very elderly neighbors because my grandpa did a lot of handy work for them and they never used it. It had less than 1000 miles on it when they got it. \n\nThe camry served as my grandma\u2019s car for several years until she gifted it to her daughter (my mom) when she got a new car for herself. My mom used the car for a few years before also getting a new car, so she then gifted it to my oldest brother. Finally, my oldest brother used it for a couple years before he decided to get himself a new car (a nice genesis as he is a medical resident and soon-to-be making bank). \n\nWhen my brother got his new car, it was obvious that I was next in line for the camry. My other older brother has a new car already and I was driving a beater. We\u2019re also very close anyway. Instead of passing it along to me like it was passed on to him and before, he offered to sell it to me for $1200. I orginally didnt think much of it because I thought it was a good deal (I\u2019m a college student and had $2000 saved up for random stuff and i figured $1200 was a good price). \n\nThen, a couple days later he called me up and said he would actually give it to me for free. I was ecstatic! I thought he was being so generous and I praised him for it. Well, I later learned from my mom that what actually happened was my grandma found out he was gonna charge me $1200, called my brother up, and basically shamed him for trying to charge his college student sister $1200 for a car that has been passed down through the family for free. He then felt guilty and decided to give it to me for free.\n\nAfter learning that, I no longer praise him for giving me the car because I kind of view it more as a family car that gets passed down whenever people get a new car. I\u2019m actually moving abroad soon and I\u2019ll be passing the camry on to my little sister who\u2019s driving the beater that I drove before I got the camry. I could never imagine charging her for it. \n\nI was talking to my brother on the phone today and the camry somehow got brought up and he mentioned how nice he was to give it to me for free. I replied that he never really shouldve tried to charge me $1200 when 1. he was gifted the car for free 2. he\u2019s about to be a doctor, and 3. im in college. He got really offended and said that he couldve charged me if he wanted but he was very generous to give it to me for free. I told him that I knew that our grandma shamed him and he said it didnt matter. \n\nI get that it was his car, but i feel like it would be wrong to charge for it since its been passed down through our family and he was just part of the succession.

I'm glad the old lady called him out on it.", "NTA. Your brother sounds desperate to get something in exchange for this car, even after your grandma shut him down.

Maybe show him this thread to make it clear, he is the only one thinking he was generous.", "NTA but your brother is. Money is more important to him then family.

Enjoy your journey, sounds like a good life ahead!", "NTA and I don\u2019t agree with your brothers statement that he could have charged you for the car.
