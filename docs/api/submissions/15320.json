I told her Michael knew before even I did and never told her either and he was her husband. She was surprised and didn't believe me at first but he didn't cover his lie quick enough and it was pretty clear. Michael was pissed at me for telling her that and said I should have owned up to knowing and not telling her. I called him a hypocrite and he said I had no right to throw him under the bus.

Michael couldn't care less about his kids wants or needs, and Hannah also entirely refused to accept how selfish and cruel her actions were.

The fact that all three are totally NC should be a wake up call for them, but I guess not.", "NTA, you were 16 when it happened, also people always like to get mad at the messenger and so I understand why at 16 it probably was the best choice to stay out of it? Not only what but you were protecting the kids ( weather purposely or not) from there new step mom being mad at them. \n\nI\u2019m honestly not sure what the right thing to do in this situation is, but I honestly think this is info she probably NEVER needed to find out.", "NTA at all. Your brother is facing the consequences of his choices. I feel bad for his kids.", "Nta\nYour brother is though.", "NTA... but the two assholed that are your brother and SIL are a match made in heaven. They are both equally stubborn, ignorant, more then capable of holding a life altering grudge and seen to still have no comprehension or understanding in regards to your brothers kids. What a match!", "NTA, easily. It wasn't your truth to tell, and since you aren't even close, she thinking you should have told her us just delusional. Your brother is the main AH. And also delusional for thinking you should have had his back, since you're not that close neither.\n\nAnd I'm so sorry for those kids... Losing their mother, father getting a new girlfriend that kinda tried to force them to adopt her...", "ESH except maybe Hannah. You all suck.", "ESH\n\n~~EAH. (EVERYBODY'S AN ASSHOLE(?))~~\n\nYou shouldn't have thrown your brother under the bus. \n\nHe shouldn't have hidden that from her. Sure, the day of the wedding I'd say it was good crisis control but after? Come on!\n\nShe shouldn't force herself to be the new mom. That never ends well.\n\nThey should've talked to the kids more, but in the end it's their life too.\n\nThe kids going no contact for what's essentially ~~a tantrum~~ an unresolved tantrum and ignored feelings is a dick move as well but understandable.

Projecting, much? \n\nNTA", "My brother would have to care if he were to take that as a sign the kids needed help. But he doesn't care because he believes he is right and the kids are wrong. I also think he saw them not going at his pace annoying and like they were doing it to spite him.", "Michael thinks so. Hannah, I don't know what she thinks right now exactly, other than she still doesn't fully realize that the kids were never in a place to see her as a new mom and were never even the tiniest bit on board with her joining the family.

Being delusional doesn't make it better, either :( I hope they are in a better place now.", "Yeah being a step mom is hard, I grew up with one and hated her when I was little, and I feel like my dad would tell her when I said things about that and it would just cause her to hate me too. When didn\u2019t get along until I became an adult. I also now am able to look at it from her perspective and realize that it\u2019s probably hard to create a bond with kids that don\u2019t like you right away. Also it would be one thing if you were super close with your SIL but it sounds like your not so I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, I honestly don\u2019t think she should be worried about it. It was so long ago and clearly they stayed together so it all worked out! I hope she has a great relationship with the kids now", "I rephrased it, you are right. They still shouldn't do that, but hey, not your kids, not your problem.", "Thanks", "The kids went no contact with her and Michael when they moved out of the house. They never had a good relationship with her and their relationship with Michael went very downhill.", "The kids and I are still close and all three lived with me for a short time after moving out. I just don't think they will regret their decision. They have years of a bad relationship with Michael and Michael doesn't care one bit. He wasn't surprised when they went no contact.", "I speak from personal experience, that guilt won't hit until he dies. I don't know the full story, I hope for their sake that you are right.", "I'm sorry about the guilt. I hope so too. Though I am relatively confident given he's not upset about them not being in his life anymore either so I feel like they are better off this way.", "I often have to wonder where do these people find someone to marry to quickly after their partners dying. On top of that with children! \nThere are so many single people that for years have not found anyone they would marry, I wonder if widow(ers) just rush to marry the first person they find, just to have someone helping them with childcare. \nBut also, who sees a recently single parent with small children that haven\u2019t even gotten over the death of their other parent and think \u201cjackpot!\u201d ?", "NTA. Hannah seems willfully delusional. Why wouldn\u2019t she at least suspect the kids right away? She thought she\u2019d win them over? Nope.", "NTA. So the 3 kids cut contact and your brother still convince he's right? Sounds like a \"smart nice guy\" I hope the kids at least have each other.  The lies people convince themselves of will always surprise me.", "NTA. As a parent, that whole situation is so devastating to read. They were so, so young so their pain is so, so obvious. He is an A H for not nurturing his grieving kids. They needed more people like you who would protect and love them. Your brother messed up in such a nuclear way it doesn\u2019t surprise me he\u2019s blaming you, but you have nothing to be sorry for.", "NTA. You were a child yourself when it happened, it wasn't your place to tell. I'm so glad your nieces and nephews have you in their life.

Michael has a difficult time accepting responsibility for his actions it seems. His and Hannah's actions when dating, planning the ceremony and raising those kids over the years is why they all cut them off after 18. Now he's upset that his wife knows he knew what his kids did years ago to sabotage their wedding when it was happening? Keep driving that bus because Michael has no problem being a bus driver himself. Definitely NTA.", "NTA", "YTA. It is not your place to tell the truth. You did this because you don't like them and you are petty. All the other details you gave are just to cover your horrible behavior. I really don't want people like you around me since you are the ones that living hard.", "ESH\n\n\nEveryone here is horrible.", "Why? OP should've protected the guy who threw her under the bus?", "Sounds like he's used to only thinking what he wants matters no matter how it hurts others.\n\nNTA He can't throw you under the bus and then complain you didn't protect him.", "That's pathetic. I mean....just wow. \n\nA little over a year and \"hey kids, here's your new mom!\"? Gross. Children, especially at that age, experience trauma  of that magnitude much differently than us. Mom was there, suddenly she's not. It's not a \"get over it. Here's a new model!\" situation. The kid's feelings should have had some say in this; clearly, they weren't happy about this.\n\nI get the not caring. That's his prerogative if he wants to stick to it. Don't expect anyone else to do the same. We're not always right 100% of the time, even though it feels like we should be. \n\nYou're NTA here, OP. Your brother sounds like a piece of work.", "I agree with your assessment he wasn\u2019t oblivious. I just can\u2019t imagine watching my kids react that way and not having a huge, sobering wake-up call and about face. It\u2019s so sad.", "The fact that he and his wife have been cut off should give him some clue that he was wrong.  Talk about willful blindness.", "Reading your comments, I'm getting the feeling that he was waiting for her to die so he could move on or something. What an AH.\n\nWas the late-wife sick or her death was due to an accident or something sudden?", "OP should not be an asshole and lie to his SIL for years...", "The only person who lied was SIL husband.  It was not OP responsibility when they were only 16 to tell SIL who ruined her wedding. Especially when her husband knew what happened.", "I didn't say it was his responsibility.  I said he's an asshole for not saying anything for years.", "It sounds like your painful experiences are causing a bias here that is misplaced. 5, 6, and 7 is so you g but old enough to feel real pain. These kids were grieving their dead mother. I don\u2019t understand how you call their behaviors a tantrum. They don\u2019t have anything to feel guilty for. They were neglected as children and acted out toward the person who should have been protecting them. He was the adult and too selfish to do what was right.", "Oh they were definitely mistreated by their father (I mentioned that), they're adults now though, the \"just a child\" defense stopped applying years ago. It's totally their problem and their right but that doesn't make it alright. Understanding isn't the same as justifying.\n\nBeing understandably angry at the father seemingly moving on too quickly (it's his prerogative to decide how quickly he moves on). Crashing a wedding isn't acceptable behaviour", "They were 6, 7, and 8 year olds when the wedding happened. Their mother had just died and they were children who received no emotional support from their father, who was also trying to force a new parent on them. They were totally justified to cut off their dad. Stop projecting so much.", "Well I feel sorry for Hannah. She had rose colored glasses and never really understood the depth of the children's animosity. Your brother fully knew. Instead of slowing down the wedding and getting his kids in therapy he lied to Hannah and ignored his kids. You were 16. This was not your story to tell. NTA.", "nta lol it's not your place to say anything, it was Michael's", "Absolutely NTA\nMichael definitely ITA in fact a narcissist", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur brother is the major AH, Hannah is an AH, too.", "The biggest AH here is Micheal for everything he put his kids through and for leading Hannah on about what kind of relationship she would have with his kids.\n\nHannah is a (possibly well meaning) AH for trying to replace the kids mother and not listening to them when they objected.\n\nThis post can be summarised with the clownface meme (micheal is the clown). NTA", "NTA- but holy crap your brother and SIL sure are! The fact that this man thinks he did nothing wrong when he stomped all over the grief of his children because he decided he was far more important is just mind blowing. All of your children don\u2019t cut contact with you unless you have been a **** parent. I\u2019m glad you were able to be there for the kids OP, and I\u2019m glad they are doing well in their lives now.", "NTA", "NTA you know the answer. All three of his own children cut contact from him because what a giant asshole he and his wife were. Screw what he or his wife thinks. I hope you kept contact with your nieces/nephews and let them know if they need anything your door is always open.", "NTA, I've read your comments about how he ignored how the kids felt and how he felt only his feelings matter. He deserves the non-contact and I hope your niblings are feeling okay now and can remember their real mom in peace.", "I'm rather impressed at the resourcefulness of those three kids at that age. To accomplish all that in an act of sabotage!  \n\n\nAnyway, you were not the problem, the events were not the problem, the problem was that your brother pushed it too soon and too hard. 13 months after the kid's mother died he was already exchanging vows with another woman? Who then progressed with the full court pressure with \"I'm your new mommy!\"?   \n\n\nAll of this is on them. Kids were still grieving and some random woman is telling them she is going to replace mum? What were they thinking?", "NTA", "NTA. You didn't throw your brother under the bus. You just didn't cover for his lies.", "I will never understand why people rush to get married. Like you can effectively be 'married' without a government license. Heck, even in some states you never need a license. \n\nIt sounds like they moved way too fast, but the kids are also undisciplined - it is one thing to grieve and throw tantrums, but another thing to do what they did.   \n\n\n>He did not cheat on his first wife (at least not with Hannah)\n\nAnd this statement feels weird. If I read into it, it sounds like maybe his unfaithfulness could be another reason why the kids don't talk to him anymore.  \n\n\nNTA.", "You were 16 and, besides, it was not your circus and not your monkeys. NTA", "NTA- Michael and Hannah are jerks. I'm glad your nieces/nephews are happier now and that you're involved in their lives.", "NTA at all", "It... Sounds like two bird of a feather Michael and Hannah. You owe him nothing, it doesn't sound like you are close and he was an AH who deserved what he got and then some. Now he again is deserving of Hannah's anger. NTA", "I know of a person who was remarried less than 6 months after. Hope there wasn't cheating, but it gets suspicious at times.\n\nAlso OP, nta. Your brother should've told her and had many years to do so on his own.", "And she still hasn't figured out that the kids won't like her! She must be a potted plant. Or fake.", "She probably thought it was all just accidents. I mean it\u2019s totally normally to misplace a tie or piece of jewelry. It might have never crossed her mind these things happened for a purpose", "Especially since it sounds like the kids weren't at the wedding like they were \"supposed\" to be.\n\nNot exactly one of the greatest mysteries of our time.", "I added that part in because a lot of people tend to say there's no way they met after his first wife died, etc. I was young enough at the time that he could have cheated on his first wife when she was alive. But I was there when he and Hannah met so I can confirm they did not have a relationship before his first wife died. Was trying not to have every comment suggest affair basically.", "Ah, so the kids lost their only parent and got stuck with the adult who doesn't think kids are real people and that they're not allowed to have thoughts and feelings because it's inconvenient to them.", "So he thinks they will come back someday?", "I'm glad you could be a safe place for them. At least they have one adult they trust who respects their feelings.", "Asking this respectfully but is your sister in law perhaps a bit na\u00efve or not particularly sharp?  How would she NOT attribute all of those incidents to the kids?  We're there rumors surrounding the quick remarriage that could have influenced the kids?  Did your bro and sisinlaw make any effort to get counselling for the kids?", "I guess the added parenthesis made me think he was a cheater.. without it, I wouldn't have questioned his faithfulness. My bad, I understand what you mean.", "He doesn't seem to care but she sure seems to believe that.", "She's naive when it comes to the kids for sure. She believed in part it was due to the rush to get everything ready for the wedding and things went wrong for that reason. No rumors, the kids were angry about the whole new mom stuff. No counseling, no.", "You said everyone sucks. Therefore you believe that some of the blame is on OP"]}
