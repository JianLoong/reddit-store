I only see them at family functions and generally we're not chit chatting. For my dad's birthday last weekend we were all at my parents house for a dinner. Sometime during the dinner Hannah found out that Michael's 3 kids had been responsible for things going wrong at their wedding and when she saw my lack of reaction she jumped on the fact I knew and never said anything to her for 16 years. I told her Michael knew before even I did and never told her either and he was her husband. She was surprised and didn't believe me at first but he didn't cover his lie quick enough and it was pretty clear. Michael was pissed at me for telling her that and said I should have owned up to knowing and not telling her. I called him a hypocrite and he said I had no right to throw him under the bus. A few other family members suspected/knew. My sister's three kids knew, and it might have been the youngest who let it slip, not sure. My sister and my parents suspected too but never knew. Hannah and Michael left soon after but Michael made it very clear he considered me a childish princess for the \"stunt\".\n\nThe BG for those who will need/want it. Michael was married before to his kids' mom. She died when they were 5, 6 and 7 years old. Michael met Hannah 7 months later and married her 13 months after his first wife died. He did not cheat on his first wife (at least not with Hannah), he just moved very fast when he met her and was already going to date again when they met. Hannah was very eager to be a mom to the kids. She knew them three months when she told them she was going to love being their mom. Their wedding was quickly planned. The kids were not happy. They said it was moving too fast, they didn't want a new mom, Michael and Hannah didn't listen to them. Hannah even wrote these very emotionally driven vows for the kids, promising she would always be there for them and was not just promising herself to their dad as his wife, but to the three of them to be their mom. The kids took the vows and burned them. They also messed with the wedding cake, hid the necklace Hannah wanted to wear on their wedding day, threw my brother's wedding ring away and took the tie he was supposed to wear that was gifted by Hannah's dad. Hannah was so upset at the stuff that went wrong. I found out the day of the wedding. I was 16 at the time and ended up having the kids left with me because my brother was pissed they wouldn't fix what they did. All three kids went no contact with Michael and Hannah when they moved out of the house at 18. Over the years none of them were okay with things. Michael remained angry over what happened but never told Hannah and Hannah remained oblivious and thought the kids would one day accept her as their mom if she kept calling herself that.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682065245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tuvix/aita_for_telling_my_sil_my_brother_knew_what_went/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In regards to you question NTA\n\nIn the bigger picture, man do these two suck! HARD!  \nIt's okay to move on quickly, some people are just that way BUT you can't expect the kids to move on this quickly and especially not \"demand\" (for a lack of better word) to become the mom over night.  \nThe whole \"shenanigans\" at the wedding should have been a warning sign, that the kids need more time to adjust, perhaps therapy and not a quick \"You mom is dead, please say hello to your new mom\"", "NTA but woah, your brother and SIL made some very poor, selfish decisions, and at least from what you've written here are bad people. Michael couldn't care less about his kids wants or needs, and Hannah also entirely refused to accept how selfish and cruel her actions were. The fact that the three kids went no-contact as soon as they could speaks volumes.\n\nFor the actual AITA, of course you aren't the asshole. Why exactly would this jerk think you would just fall on your sword for something that had nothing to do with you in the first place? It was entirely his and SIL's fault, and they clearly did nothing to rectify the situation since. They think kids just act out because they are bad kids?", "NTA - your brother and Hannah were/are oblivious to the feelings of the kids and moved at a pace that did not take the kids into consideration.  The fact that all three are totally NC should be a wake up call for them, but I guess not.", "NTA, you were 16 when it happened, also people always like to get mad at the messenger and so I understand why at 16 it probably was the best choice to stay out of it? Not only what but you were protecting the kids ( weather purposely or not) from there new step mom being mad at them. \n\nI\u2019m honestly not sure what the right thing to do in this situation is, but I honestly think this is info she probably NEVER needed to find out.", "NTA at all. Your brother is facing the consequences of his choices. I feel bad for his kids.", "Nta\nYour brother is though.", "NTA... but the two assholed that are your brother and SIL are a match made in heaven. They are both equally stubborn, ignorant, more then capable of holding a life altering grudge and seen to still have no comprehension or understanding in regards to your brothers kids. What a match!", "NTA, easily. It wasn't your truth to tell, and since you aren't even close, she thinking you should have told her us just delusional. Your brother is the main AH. And also delusional for thinking you should have had his back, since you're not that close neither.\n\nAnd I'm so sorry for those kids... Losing their mother, father getting a new girlfriend that kinda tried to force them to adopt her...", "ESH except maybe Hannah. You all suck.", "ESH\n\n~~EAH. (EVERYBODY'S AN ASSHOLE(?))~~\n\nYou shouldn't have thrown your brother under the bus. \n\nHe shouldn't have hidden that from her. Sure, the day of the wedding I'd say it was good crisis control but after? Come on!\n\nShe shouldn't force herself to be the new mom. That never ends well.\n\nThey should've talked to the kids more, but in the end it's their life too.\n\nThe kids going no contact for what's essentially ~~a tantrum~~ an unresolved tantrum and ignored feelings is a dick move as well but understandable. He is still their father and they *will* regret it when he dies with them hating him.\n\nEDIT: fixed formatting, added a bit to the kids part and fixed the bot tag", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Projecting, much? \n\nNTA", "My brother would have to care if he were to take that as a sign the kids needed help. But he doesn't care because he believes he is right and the kids are wrong. I also think he saw them not going at his pace annoying and like they were doing it to spite him.", "Michael thinks so. Hannah, I don't know what she thinks right now exactly, other than she still doesn't fully realize that the kids were never in a place to see her as a new mom and were never even the tiniest bit on board with her joining the family. She was shocked when they went no contact even though everyone else saw it coming.", "My brother isn't oblivious. He simply doesn't care. He thinks they are wrong, he is right and that they should have gotten over the speed it happened and embraced Hannah within the first two years because she was there and willing to mother them. I also think he still holds a grudge against them for what happened.", "Best choice to stay out of it and I figured it would be the best way to be there for the kids as well. I love my niece and nephews and I could see they were hurting and I didn't want them to have things be even harder after it. Their dad didn't care how they felt. Hannah was so convinced they would love her one day and want her to be their mom that she did what she liked. They spent years wishing someone else in the family could just take them away from them but it wasn't possible and honestly, I thought after all these years it wouldn't get out.", "Thankfully they are doing good now and have happier lives than when they lived with him and Hannah. They each lived with me for a short while after moving out of my brother's house.", "It's not a tantrum on the kids part. They don't like either Michael or Hannah and wanted to be done with them because the relationship was not something they wanted to work on. Going no contact was coming for years and everyone saw it except for Hannah at the time.", "ESH (everybody sucks here) is the judgement you need for the judgement bot\n\nAnd I agree with your judgement!", "That's really sad. Being delusional doesn't make it better, either :( I hope they are in a better place now.", "Yeah being a step mom is hard, I grew up with one and hated her when I was little, and I feel like my dad would tell her when I said things about that and it would just cause her to hate me too. When didn\u2019t get along until I became an adult. I also now am able to look at it from her perspective and realize that it\u2019s probably hard to create a bond with kids that don\u2019t like you right away. Also it would be one thing if you were super close with your SIL but it sounds like your not so I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, I honestly don\u2019t think she should be worried about it. It was so long ago and clearly they stayed together so it all worked out! I hope she has a great relationship with the kids now", "I rephrased it, you are right. They still shouldn't do that, but hey, not your kids, not your problem.", "Thanks", "The kids went no contact with her and Michael when they moved out of the house. They never had a good relationship with her and their relationship with Michael went very downhill.", "The kids and I are still close and all three lived with me for a short time after moving out. I just don't think they will regret their decision. They have years of a bad relationship with Michael and Michael doesn't care one bit. He wasn't surprised when they went no contact.", "I speak from personal experience, that guilt won't hit until he dies. I don't know the full story, I hope for their sake that you are right.", "I'm sorry about the guilt. I hope so too. Though I am relatively confident given he's not upset about them not being in his life anymore either so I feel like they are better off this way."]}
