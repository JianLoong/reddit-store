People like her often try to pretend their nasty comments are humour and will often respond with \u201cwhere\u2019s your sense of humour?\u201d as a defense for the indefensible. She seems to focus all this nastiness on you so I can only assume she\u2019s projecting her insecurities onto you as bullies often do.

She is a bully, full stop, and no one needs to cater to bullies. \n\nHere are some of the favorite hallmarks of bullies or their enablers:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just how she is.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d\nAll of these are being used on you to enable the bully. \n\nYou said you\u2019re worried you\u2019re insecure. Well, put that crap right out of your head. Insecurity=putting up with the bullying. Having a sense of self worth=enacting strong boundaries.\n\nSo\u2026you\u2019re going to have to decide what you\u2019re going to do to protect yourself and enact strong boundaries. The first thing I\u2019d suggest you do is kick her the hell out of your house. Immediately. Do not threaten, just do it. \n\nIf you can\u2019t do that for whatever reason (you said you live with other family), then take back your bed and room and space in your closet, etc. Let the bully sleep on the effing sofa.\n\nThen, stop spending time with her. If you\u2019re stuck having to, come up with some wording to use Every Single Time she spouts her bully crap. Something like, \u201cThat is rude and I don\u2019t wish to be around rude people.\u201d Or, \u201cYou\u2019re not \u2018funny,\u2019 you\u2019re a bully.\u201d\n\nWhen the bully or her enablers say (because they will), \u201cThat\u2019s just what they do in their culture,\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s just trying to bond\u201d (wtf bullsh-t is that?!?) or \u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive,\u201d or whatever, you can say, \u201cTo me, that is bullying behavior and she/you only seem to do it to me. But whatever, i have enough self-respect to not put up with it, so I\u2019m not going to go with you or spend any time with you outside of what I absolutely have to.\u201d Or some such.\n\nThe key is to decide what to say beforehand so you\u2019re not flustered in the moment, and Do Not cave under the pressure that you\u2019re inevitably going to get. You deserve better than being bullied by someone you just met. Let your other family members deal with her! \n\nAnd in case it\u2019s not clear you are 1000000% NTA. Please update us on how it goes. Good luck!", "If this is her/our culture, you can keep it. I'd rather reject my heritage than go around being cruel to others.\n\nThe only bond being formed is the judgement I'm sealing on her poor character.\n\nSensitive people don't have the strength to hold the size of grudge she's building with her nastiness.
