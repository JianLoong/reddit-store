We didn\u2019t grow up in contact with one another as she was raised in a foreign country and I was raised in the US. She was basically a stranger to me up until a week ago when she decided to visit for two months. She came and everything was fine for the first couple days. I gave her my bed, made lots of space in my drawer and closet, bought her a new towel, etc. I even made a list of places to take her based off what she likes. She was sweet until we got around other family that I live with. \n\nShe does this thing where she will jokingly pick on someone. I noticed many people from my family\u2019s country joke around like that, so I didn\u2019t mind at first. For example:\n\n1. I was talking to my aunt and then my cousin goes \u201cdoes this girl ever stop talking oh my god she\u2019s like a radio!\u201d and laugh \n\n2. We were late because SHE was doing her makeup but then she told everyone that \u201cour American girl here loooves to cake herself with makeup that\u2019s why we were late\u201d\n\n3.

It\u2019s constant, maybe 20 small comments a day and they\u2019re always told to other people in a \u201clook at her\u201d kind of way. I ended up snapping at her and telling her that she should be thankful I let her stay with me even though she booked her ticket without even asking if I\u2019m free. I said she can leave if she can\u2019t respect me. my family later told me that it\u2019s just how they joke around in their culture and that I was being too harsh. I feel bad but the comments were constant and she rarely did them to anyone else like my brothers. I don\u2019t even know her in a way where it\u2019s ok, like I just met her.

I mean, if that's just the way her culture/country joke around and the family don't mind, the best solution is you drop her off at your parents/brothers/cousins etc and say thanks for having her.\n\nIt sounds like she is in some sort of one sided competition with the female closest in age to her.

So, if she doesn't quit it, she's on her own. Then tell the rest of your family, since they are fine with how she acts..... They can host her!", "She is toxic and an AH", "NTA. Culture is no excuse for being an obnoxious and rude bully. People like her often try to pretend their nasty comments are humour and will often respond with \u201cwhere\u2019s your sense of humour?\u201d as a defense for the indefensible. She seems to focus all this nastiness on you so I can only assume she\u2019s projecting her insecurities onto you as bullies often do. Don\u2019t accept it and tell her she\u2019s not welcome under your roof if she can\u2019t grow up and learn some respect.", "NTA OP.  I wouldn\u2019t put up with your cousin either; I would frogmarch her right out the door and tell her not to come back.", "Sorry, but your family are delusional. She is a bully, full stop, and no one needs to cater to bullies. \n\nHere are some of the favorite hallmarks of bullies or their enablers:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just how she is.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d\nAll of these are being used on you to enable the bully. \n\nYou said you\u2019re worried you\u2019re insecure. Well, put that crap right out of your head. Insecurity=putting up with the bullying. Having a sense of self worth=enacting strong boundaries.\n\nSo\u2026you\u2019re going to have to decide what you\u2019re going to do to protect yourself and enact strong boundaries. The first thing I\u2019d suggest you do is kick her the hell out of your house. Immediately. Do not threaten, just do it. \n\nIf you can\u2019t do that for whatever reason (you said you live with other family), then take back your bed and room and space in your closet, etc. Let the bully sleep on the effing sofa.\n\nThen, stop spending time with her. If you\u2019re stuck having to, come up with some wording to use Every Single Time she spouts her bully crap. Something like, \u201cThat is rude and I don\u2019t wish to be around rude people.\u201d Or, \u201cYou\u2019re not \u2018funny,\u2019 you\u2019re a bully.\u201d\n\nWhen the bully or her enablers say (because they will), \u201cThat\u2019s just what they do in their culture,\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s just trying to bond\u201d (wtf bullsh-t is that?!?) or \u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive,\u201d or whatever, you can say, \u201cTo me, that is bullying behavior and she/you only seem to do it to me. But whatever, i have enough self-respect to not put up with it, so I\u2019m not going to go with you or spend any time with you outside of what I absolutely have to.\u201d Or some such.\n\nThe key is to decide what to say beforehand so you\u2019re not flustered in the moment, and Do Not cave under the pressure that you\u2019re inevitably going to get. You deserve better than being bullied by someone you just met. Let your other family members deal with her! \n\nAnd in case it\u2019s not clear you are 1000000% NTA. Please update us on how it goes. Good luck!", "If this is her/our culture, you can keep it. I'd rather reject my heritage than go around being cruel to others.\n\nThe only bond being formed is the judgement I'm sealing on her poor character.\n\nSensitive people don't have the strength to hold the size of grudge she's building with her nastiness. Thankfully, I have more than enough strength to hold it forever.", "She's a pick-me girl and can't turn it off.   Maybe today's the day she leaves to stay with other family members, because being rude to your host is not cute.   And she really needs to keep it cute.", "yeah, she\u2019s not a comedian and she\u2018s not your friend. she\u2019s a bully. plenty of bullies turn it off when they\u2019re alone with you, thay doesn\u2019t make it better. nta", "NTA.

She probably does it to you because she assumes a closeness with you she doesn't have with the boys. Of course this very much depends on tone of voice and things like that. But yeah, I have definitely met people who rib each other all the time as a sign of affection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I can also see how it is annoying. So if you're not into it, well, you're not into it. That's OK. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only way this can work is if you do it back to her.

I'd kick her out and cut her out. You don't need someone who constantly puts you down and claims it's \"culture\". There's no fucking culture in the world where that is normal."]}
