I feel disrespected, obviously if I lock my room I clearly don't want anyone in it, AND she didn't even bother to ask ?? Or tell me. My roommate flipped out on me and said I should've offered. First of all I pay rent to have my own personal space, I don't want other people in my room or on my bed when I'm not home & second of all her mom has disrespected me in the past so I'm\nnot too fond of her but I am still nice but not enough to let her sleep in my bed.

Buy some app controlled devices to place around your room, so you can just turn them on whenever. Ya know, like an alarms or something. Just place them in different areas.
