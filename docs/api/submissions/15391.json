I come back home and walk in my room and realize it's unlocked . I ask her why it's unlocked and she says her moms friend slept in my\nbed. I feel disrespected, obviously if I lock my room I clearly don't want anyone in it, AND she didn't even bother to ask ?? Or tell me. My roommate flipped out on me and said I should've offered. First of all I pay rent to have my own personal space, I don't want other people in my room or on my bed when I'm not home & second of all her mom has disrespected me in the past so I'm\nnot too fond of her but I am still nice but not enough to let her sleep in my bed. If they want a bed they should get a hotel right ?? Am I overreacting or am I actually the asshole?\n\n\nUPDATE /// thank you all for the ideas , I just put in a new doorknob to where I need an actual key instead of just a basic screwdriver. My door before was just a standard door where you just need a screwdriver or even bobby pin . This should prevent anyone from getting in now. Even though I shouldn\u2019t need to take this measure in my own apartment. Also no , she didn\u2019t wash the sheets after , and my lease is up in august , if I wanted to leave it would be a ton of fees if not I might even have to pay rest of rent since I\u2019m HOH (head of household) I will also not be living with her after this lease is up.", "created_utc": 1682140832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uvprd/aita_for_locking_my_door_in_my_apartment/", "score": 2674, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He finally came back and said \"ABSOLUTELY WE ARE DONE!!!!\" and he sprayed DE everywhere. He also taught us how to do it right. The key is to use a fine layer not absolutely NUKE with it. They can sense it if theres too much and avoid it. You could just BARELY see where the de had been.\n\nHe also gave us a can of a product called Crossfire.
