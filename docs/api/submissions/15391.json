I would have FLIPPED.  My old roommate and I had an agreement that when she was away, when I came back to the apartment after being out, I could check her closet and bathroom.  She understood that I couldn't feel comfortable until I check every closet in the apartment.  Never in a million years would I let anyone else in her room, or sleep in her bed.  I never snooped, it was just a check.  We discussed it, she gave her permission.  We are still besties.  You have to gain permission to even open the door, IMO.
