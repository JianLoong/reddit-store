I specifically asked if he was good with kids because I have a 4 year old of my own, she said he\u2019s great with kids and was raised with 7 of them. I paid before even meeting him (terrible mistake on my part)\n\nWhen the dog got to my place, he was TERRIFIED. I understand rehoming is emotionally hard on any dog, but this was more than just \u201cnew home anxiety\u201d. It seemed like this poor pup has never been inside or around humans it\u2019s entire life, EXTREMELY skiddish, to the point he wouldn\u2019t go up my stairs (even with treats) that I have to use to enter my apartment. After about 10 minutes I finally got him upstairs.\n\nHe seemed terrified of everything, his food bowls, the wall decorations, the doors, anything that moved scared this dog so much. That\u2019s when he started chasing my child around and literally getting on top of him, trying to hump him while I try my best to get him off of my child. He then moves to me, for literally 5 minutes he was up humping me. I\u2019d push him away and he\u2019d get right back up, I have so many scratches from it. Because he was so nervous I got scared and thought he\u2019d eventually bite me, thankfully he didn\u2019t.\n\nHe was in my home for a total of around 30 minutes before I told her I needed to bring him back. Originally I told her she could keep the money, while I was in a panicked state worried about the safety of my child. After I had calmed down I told her I needed the money back, and she blocked me. I then texted her from a friends phone saying I really need the money back because the dog was barely in my care and he was a danger to my child.\n\nShe then had a friend of hers text me saying I told her she could keep the money to \u201cget out of the situation I created for myself\u201d, told me to stop harassing her (I sent 1 text from my friends phone), said she\u2019s on a tight budget and has no money to give, that when you buy something like a pet there\u2019s no return policy (which is understandable but again I had the dog for only THIRTY minutes and was not made aware of the dogs true state). This friend of hers is telling me \u201cwhy not come here and I\u2019ll give it to you\u201d, calling me a \u201crat goof\u201d and \u201cflaming cock smoker\u201d (lol?)\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting my money back or is she in the right? Because I did say she could keep the money originally.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m now aware I\u2019m the asshole in this situation, thank you for everyone who replied. I should\u2019ve prepared more and taken some time to think about what I\u2019m doing first. 30 minutes is definitely not enough time for a puppy to relax in a new environment. I won\u2019t be getting any animals any time soon, and will do so much more to prepare if I ever decide in the future to have one.

In the animal rescue world potential adopters are told it can take UP TO 3 MONTHS for a new pet to adjust to a new home.  And that\u2019s if there isn\u2019t a traumatic past. This dog was taken away from everything he had known in his 10 month life.  His pack, his home, anything that was familiar to him.

Pets are living and breathing beings, not accessories to buy and dispose of on a whim.  Specific breeds have specific requirements in order to stay happy and healthy.  They can also be traumatized from abusive humans.  I had 1 foster dog who was literally born feral and he stayed with me for 5 months before getting adopted.  Had another one returned with 2 HOURS of being adopted because because the freaking adopter let the neighbors toddler corner the poor dog in their backyard and got mad when the dog dared to growl at the kid.  This was after I told her the dog didn\u2019t do well around young kids that made sudden movements or didn\u2019t respect boundaries.  Some animals never fully recover from crappy owners like you.

It\u2019s a sentient being that just got taken from the home it knows and put in the care of a stranger who is freaking the fuck out as all kinds of new smells and sounds break out around him.

Why would you think an apartment is a good environment for a husky/shepherd mix? Both breeds are working breeds that need a ton of exercise and i's a puppy so it's going to be a ball of energy. If they don't get appropriate exercise, they tend to chew the everliving fuck out of anything they can get their mouths on.\n\nEven worse, you brought an animal that was clearly showing signs of distress into a new environment with a 4 year-old in it! You should have had someone watch the kid for several hours (if not overnight) to give the dog a chance to adjust to the new environment and to gauge the dog's demeanor before putting it around your defenseless child. That's so unbelievably reckless. You got incredibly lucky. P.S. The behavior you found so concerning is a common nervous behavior of dogs. \n\nYou told her she could keep the money if she took the dog back.

Don't buy dogs on a whim (really, no one should be buying dogs when there's so many sitting in rescues and shelters).

If you are a new inexperienced pet owner they would want to give you a submissive pup that will be easier to train.  Next time, before considering buying a dog, do some research on different breeds and what kind of dog will do well in an apartment with kids and a beginner owner and make sure you research the breeder that you are buying from.

Around a FOUR YEAR OLD!? Have you ever met dogs before? Or four year olds for that matter?
