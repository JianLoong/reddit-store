Outside of seeing the gift-giver, we never wear them again. Unfortunately for you, the out-of-touch gift giver is cohabitating with you. The truth may hurt, but it beats wearing something that makes you feel like a background dancer for Earth Wind and Fire.", "NTA. My mum has a whole box full of the same style jewelry from my dad that she hates. I swear it took her 30 years to tell him it wasn\u2019t her style. \n\nDon\u2019t fake it in your relationship - telling him \u2018I love you and I love that you put thought and care into my gift. It\u2019s not really my style, but I appreciate the thoughtfulness\u2019 etc. may hurt, but being lied to hurts more. Also maybe he could have returned or exchanged it if you told him sooner.", "NTA. You told him what you like, and he ignored it. Tbh, I want to give a small yta only for the fact that you didn't tell him immediately. If you had, he could've taken it back and got you a necklace of your choosing. It might be too late for that. Also, I think he's NTA cause he got you a nice gift, and he wanted to spoil you. Again a small yta for him for not listening to what you wanted.", "NTA - He hinted about jewelry, you gave him some easy to follow suggestions. He decided to get something that was the complete opposite of what you suggested. If this is a gift for you then a) he should have taken your tastes into consideration; and b) it should not come with any obligations to wear more often than you want to. \n\nPicking out jewelry for another person can be challenging. I am even willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on his selection. He may have thought you were asking for something delicate because you felt bad about him spending money on you. He may have gotten something more flashy than your usual style because he thought you hadn't worn something like that before because you couldn't afford to. But a gift for YOU should be about YOU. Try saying:\n\n\"I appreciate that you got me such a generous gift, but its not my style and not something I will wear regularly. Is it possible to exchange it for something that is more my style?\"\n\nHow he responds to that will tell you a lot about what is going on here. It may be that his \"gift\" had more to do with his ego than your happiness. (e.g. He wanted to get something big and flashy that shows off the money he is making and he wants you to wear it often so that people ask about it and you tell them what a generous gift he got you. He wants you to be a visual representation of his success.)", "NTA He can wear the pendant since he bought it to suit his tastes and not yours. \n\nFor his birthday, you can by something that you'd like, but he specifically said he doesn't. Oh, he doesn't like the present you picked? No, that can't be right. That logic worked for your birthday, after all.", "NTA.  He ignored your preferences to get a gift that suited his tastes, and seemingly left no room for you to gently/politely ask to exchange it.  You are not obligated to change your personal style for him.", "NTA\n\nMaybe he thought \u201coh, op really wants something bigger but she is being polite\u201d, maybe it was a mistake or maybe he just decided he liked what he got better or he wants something bigger that when people compliment you, you can say \u201cbf got it for me\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t like it and aren\u2019t going to wear. These can be difficult conversations, but will help your relationship in the long run if you have it. I\u2019d explain that it\u2019s a pretty necklace, it\u2019s just not your taste. You know he but effort and thought into it but you\u2019re not comfortable wearing it and perhaps you guys could go together and exchange it for something you\u2019d like. \n\nMe sometimes are funny with jewelry. They can understand not liking certain clothes, but not jewelry or handbags.\n\nGood luck.", "INFO: have you actually had a direct conversation about your taste and preferences?? Have you actually told him that his gift isnt in line with that and therefore you wont be wearing it often?? \n\nCos leaving leaflets in somebodys car is just about the worst for of communication in the modern world i can think of what", "NTA - You tell him what you liked and he chooses to ignore it", "NTA\n\nI will never understand why some partners do this, spending a shitload of money on something they've not already confirmed is to the recipient partner's tastes. It doesn't sound like you were particularly subtle when letting him know what you'd like, either. You should've had a discussion with him prior to now about the necklace, but I suppose you have the opportunity to do that now! If it can be returned/exchanged, he will most likely also be happier down the line if he takes advantage of that, so he can see you enjoying the gift he gave. If he decides to act like a douchanoe and make demands that you keep it, it can collect dust in your jewelry box. If it isn't exchangeable, you might consider wearing it a couple times a year to be a good sport, but I'd consider that optional on your part. He should've paid attention to what you said you wanted in the first place.", "NTA, it's generally kinda weird to insist a partner wear something she doesn't wanna wear, it's unfortunate he picked a bad gift but it happens, he can return it, sell it, or regift it. You could hang it up as room decoration. There are other ways to deal with his buyer's remorse than him pressuring you to wear something you dont wanna wear.,", "Nta - but I would keep the gift and the thought that came with it....if it has an accident and gets remade into something else, well....\n\nI've worn necklaces wrapped around my wrist as a bracelet before - could that work ?\n\nI know some people say its more honest to tell someone you don't like stuff, can you swap it etc but that kind of assumes the giftgiver didnt put a world of effort into choosing something for you. And its difficult to soften that blow if you go there.", "No it\u2019s his own fault, you told him what you wanted and he just ignored you. U ate.", "NTA OMG I *loath* the idea that good jewelery must be given by men.\n\nLuckily my husband knows my tastes, *but* he would also know better than to spend a substantial amount of money on a piece without consulting me.\n\nThe media has ingrained in men the idea that a woman will be *thrilled* with a gift of jewelery, *any* jewelery, really, as long as it\u2019s expensive. When, (to *me*, anyway), it would be more likely be a response of WTF is this when I open the little  box.\n\nYour fiancee got you something *he* likes, or a friend that went shopping with him liked, or that the sales person at the jewelery store convinced him any woman would *love*.\n\nWell, you *didn\u2019t*. And he didn\u2019t listen to you, even remotely, when you tried to guide him. This is not good. This is a red flag.\n\nYou need to sit him down and have a little discussion about how much this is not good. You have your own personality and style and opinions and they should be respected.\n\nMy husband suggests you explain it to him as if, for example, you buy him for his birthday something that is adjacent to but not quite right for whatever hobby he likes. Something nice, expensive, but not actually useful to him at *all*, and with only marginal thought put into it. Wouldn\u2019t he be *grateful*? Why isn\u2019t he *using* it?", "NTA. Men can be so clueless and/or careless about stuff like that, that you have to clobber them over the head with it (and sometimes that doesn't even work). The leaflets and hints weren't enough here.", "NTA. Sometimes our loved ones buy us well intended gifts that we just don't like. Or cant use often. That's not your fault. You accepted the gift graciously, wore it to be polite and kept it cuz it means something to you.  That's all he can expect. \n\nMy bf sometimes gets me expensive things and gets upset or teases me for not using them. Like the 700 dollar vaporizer he got me. I love it, was fun to play around with. But uses up alot of product and isnt something I can use multiple times a day realistically. Took me forever to get him to accept that I loved the gift,  it just wasnt going to replace my normal routine. He likes to maximize and use the most up to date stuff for everything. Now he gives me less of a fuss when I pick and choose when to use gifts, because he gets thought goes into everything I do.", "NTA. It was a very nice gesture of your fiance, but ultimately not a considerate one. Maybe try to sit him down and explain it in further detail - let him know you love the fact that he wanted to treat you with something expensive, but it's not something you can enjoy as it doesn't match anything you own previously... and see if it's possible to exchange it for something that's more tailored to your style. The fact that he didn't take your hints and suggestion into account from the start is what landed you here in the end", "YTA. Not because you didn't wear it but because you didn't have an honest conversation with him after he gifted it to you. Jewlery is returnable.   \n\nYou plan on spending the rest of your life with this man.  Do you want him to continue to waste money on things you won't wear?   Instead of waiting for him to notice you should have told him.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that would sit in your jewellery box he should have gotten something that fitted your style. It's not that hard, and if it was he could have gone shopping with you (or looked at what you wear!)", "Yes. Your neck is not part of your body - it\u2019s a display case for your partner\u2019s disposable wealth. You should wear what he buys you, regardless of your preference. And in tight times, he can rent it out as ad space, like a sports uniform. \n\nWait\u2026 no, that\u2019s not actually the case. He bought you the thing. That\u2019s your thing now. You get to decide which of your things you\u2019ll wear, when. It\u2019s that whole dressing yourself thing. As your partner, he can say \u201cI like it when you wear X\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t like it as much when you wear Y\u201d. He\u2019s allowed to have preferences. But if he bought you a thing you don\u2019t like, that\u2019s just money down the drain. You\u2019re not obliged to wear things you dislike because he bought them for you, because you\u2019re a person, not a doll. \n\nNTA.", "YTA and he's silly for wasting money on you.\n\nThis is why it is silly to buy jewelry. Spend $500 on something that's maybe worth $50.  Have someone else tell you it sucks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But that\u2019s literally just your style. Mine too.", "NTA, OP.  But sometimes, people are better with direct communication (I don\u2019t know if you circled or otherwise marked anything in the little leaflets or not - if you did, then there\u2019s no excuse and homie should\u2019ve paid attention).\n\nBack when my husband and I had just gotten together, the subject of my taste in jewelry came up, specifically wrt engagement rings and wedding bands. I\u2019m very easy to please, so I really didn\u2019t have much guidance and at that point, I didn\u2019t think it would be pressing just yet, bc it would be a minute before purchasing those things. Just gave him a general idea of what I like - unique/interesting is always paramount, don\u2019t need/want a huge stone, I\u2019ve got tiny/skinny fingers (according to my mother, I have no knuckles lol), so probably a thin band, etc. Somehow, just based on that, and not too long after that conversation, he picked the absolute most perfect set in the world for me. \n\nLike I said, some people are just bad at that kind of thing without direct communication. Perhaps next time, he\u2019ll pay attention. And next time, maybe reiterate your taste (and let him know it really isn\u2019t about budget, it\u2019s about your actual taste), or if you\u2019ve been eyeballing something, just tell him \u201cthis one,\u201d or \u201csomething like this,\u201d while showing/describing the exact features you like about it. If his love language is gifts, he\u2019ll want to do a good job, pay attention, and show that he cares about who you are.\n\nETA: if it\u2019s too late to exchange it for something you like but neither of you wants to sell it, it might end up growing on you. It may be suited to some things you own that you don\u2019t wear too often for whatever reason, but sometimes wear when you\u2019re feeling like you want to wear something funky/flashy. Just something to keep in mind.", ">Jewlery is returnable. \n\nDepends where you get it from sometimes. Some places will only return for store credit, which limits your options a bit", "I agree. Op YTA for not actually talking to him about this, and then lying to him instead of telling him you didnt like it. He's only slightly an ah for not asking you what you'd like.", "Agreed.\n\nDid he miss the hints? Yes. Were they obvious? Well, to OP, of course they were, but to her spouse? Not at all. Is that his fault? Maybe - but I guarantee this isn't the first time OP made \"obvious hints\" that he didn't pick up on.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with OP not liking the necklace - heck, she might even like it and not wear it because it doesn't go with anything. That's a conversation (preferably right away) so it can be exchanged. Or better yet, a straight-forward conversation before hand. Maybe suggesting they go to the jewelry store together to pick it out?\n\nAs it stands, this scenario is just going to repeat in one way or another. I guess it might be E-S-H, but given we don't have both perspectives I'm ok with assuming it's YTA.", "So why did he ignore the leaflets and your stated tastes? He wasted the money, not you.\n\nI'd be shocked if this is the only example of him doing something \"nice\" for you, but not something you want.", "OP told him her preferences and he ignored them.

Are you saying OP is obligated to regularly wear jewelry she dislikes?", "The dude clearly did not take the hints. This isn\u2019t difficult to comprehend.", "NTA.\n\nYou gave him clear directives, which he chose to ignore.

You should have told him immediately that this wasn't a piece you saw yourself wearing due to it not being at all your style. When you knew what he was thinking, don't leave leaflets around, but use your words and tell him what you like and where to go.", "NTA.

He\u2019s never seen me in gold. But Im his first serious relationship so I sat down the next day when I had thought out what I wanted to say and explained how much I loved it but that I would rarely if ever wear it because it would clash with everything I wear including my body jewelry that is all silver. I explained I\u2019m not upset and I don\u2019t want it returned or anything even if it could be, but please in the future if thinking of jewelry for me stick to silver and he apologized for not noticing the preference and promised to keep that in mind.", "NTA- you made yourself very clear and he ignored everything you said. It\u2019s not rude to not wear something you neither like nor asked for, however, it might be worth explaining that while you appreciate his efforts to buy you something beautiful, it\u2019s not your style and you don\u2019t want him to waste his money on a gift that you won\u2019t use.", "NTA. My husband\u2019s taste is jewellery is awful but my brother\u2019s in great. It took a gentle conversation but now he double checks with my bro before he buys anything so it\u2019s still a surprise. Do you have a mutual friend who could help?", "NTA. His heart was in the right place and he tried, but you don\u2019t like it and that\u2019s absolutely fine.", "NTA when people do this it seems super controlling. First of all if he pays attention to you at all he should know what jewelry you usually wear. If he\u2019s oblivious he could easily look in your jewelry box to see what you tend to wear BUT you specifically told him. He got the opposite of what you specifically said you liked. Purposely then gets upset when you don\u2019t wear it. Seems like a power move. Yeah it\u2019s easy to accidentally get something someone isn\u2019t fond of but this seems extremely purposeful. Like how can you get your partner something so off base? It would be different if you weren\u2019t a regular jewelry wearer and he was just taking a shot in the dark. Wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a deal breaker but it would definitely make me on the lookout for other weird behaviors", "NTA\n\nRemind your boyfriend that you are an actual person and not a display for expensive accessories.

So don't wear it with anything - wear it for sexy time. He'll always appreciate that.", "NAH.\n\nHe picked jewellery for you which he thought you would like and you didn\u2019t - a communication issue.\n\nHowever, and beware - be careful about criticising his choices; he picked you after all.

If you have no access to water, a boat is a bit useless even if it's expensive. You would have to go out of your way to use said boat even though you don't like it.

You literally told him your style. Why is it, when we tell them what we want, they get the complete opposite? Like we don't know what we like?", "NTA. You showed him what you liked and he deviated. I was in the same situation a couple years ago. I dropped big money on a custom diamond necklace for my wife. She never wears it. It's not her style. I knew better too. She's always been very particular about her jewelry and she told me beforehand to not buy her jewelry because she's so picky. It's not like I did it on purpose. I was just trying to be nice. There's been instances where I have not bought her jewelry and just took her to the store where she picked out something. For instance she picked out her own engagement ring and wedding bands. Don't know why I was stupid about it.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re marrying this guy, so he\u2019s going to have to learn that he can\u2019t just style you however he wants and expect you to wear it because he spent a lot of money on it. He needs to either learn your style or, though yes, it feels less romantic, let you pick. \n\nOtherwise he\u2019s going to spend a lot of money on gifts you hate over your lives together and it will either be a constant fight or you\u2019re going to be wearing a lot of jewelry you hate just to keep the peace. \n\nFor the record, when we got engaged, my husband didn\u2019t actually buy the ring he picked out - he gave me a stand in ring and let me weigh in. I didn\u2019t actually love the ring he had picked, and instead we designed a ring together and I have never seen a ring I liked more.", "NTA\n\nYou were specific in what you liked and he still chose something that wasn't anywhere near what you would wear.\n\nI had an ex do this once. He was sweet about it though. He just returned it and picked something else out that met the perimeters.", "I\u2019m saying NTA because whilst his intentions were good, jewellery is such a personal choice that anybody who wants to buy jewellery for someone needs to research the recipient\u2019s taste and style very thoroughly. You wore it once, that\u2019s enough to show gratitude. Although I think perhaps you should not have worn it at all, so you could have gently and lovingly discussed returning it.", "NTA.

He loves brown, and apparently never noticed that I don't own any brown clothing.  I finally told him that shopping for clothing should be something we do together.", "NTA I understand where you're coming from.", "If you didn't say it to his face, then it would've been more understandable, but you did and he still picked what he'd like.

Either way,  he should not get upset about your taste being different, especially when you were polite and wore it once already.", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly in situations like that I tend to be pretty blunt and ask: \n\nPick one: me never wearing/using it or me giving it back? \n\nTheir answer determines my action.

No one should be obligated to wear/use/display a gift they don\u2019t like. But if you don\u2019t, it hurts the giver\u2019s feelings, since they put thought and money into the gift. You also run the risk of being viewed as picky or ungrateful if you are too detailed with your gift desires ahead of time. There\u2019s just no great way around it. Best thing to do is exhibit appreciation when it\u2019s gifted, but be honest so that they can hopefully return the item and get their money back. No one wins if they\u2019re out money and you\u2019re stuck with a gift you don\u2019t want.", "I mean, he was trying to be nice and surprise u with something u didn't think of which I think we can agree was well intended, the risk is of course that u wouldn't like it.

Wear it.", "Soft A H for not being upfront about not liking it.  You should have asked him to exchange it for something that is your taste.  Be appreciative of his thoughtfulness but honest that it's going to just sit in your jewelry box because it's not your taste.  A gift is supposed to be about the person receiving it, not the giver.  He's being an AH if he doesn't understand that.", "For my birthday one year my partner gave me a lovely diamond necklace and earring set\u2026but it was gold, which looks *awful* with my skin. It was an awkward conversation, but the lesson was \u201cif you\u2019re spending a lot of money on me, let\u2019s pick out the purchase together.\u201d He learned. As long as you\u2019re gentle and appreciative of his intent, NTA.", "NTA I had to tell my now husband flat out what I liked and to not just buy me something to buy me something (after he got me an expensive necklace that I hated. I did it in enough time to where he could return it.) it as super helpful in our relationship that I did that", "NTA. I'm very picky about jewelry and I very sweetly had told my hubs as such. A few times he got me stuff I wouldn't wear and when asked I told him \" it's gorgeous but it doesn't match any other jewelry I own since it's not normally my style\"... Now I just send him direct links to items I like, but I send multiple so he has choices.", "Lol. I have heard of EWT but I don\u2019t know what that would look like but it still gave me a chuckle. I give you a NTA for this remark. Love a good chuckle.", "[removed]", ">put thought and care into my gift\n\nExcept he didn't", "This right here. You definitely need to discuss this. Some men are just dense when it comes to gift giving. I should know, I'm married to one and it took over 20 years of bad gifts before he realized I'd come to despise any occasion where I'd be given a gift because there was no real effort involved. Sounds like you have a similar guy. Don't hint around, have that difficult conversation, but gently or this situation will repeat and repeat. I don't think a lot of men realize that most women have very specific tastes when it comes to certain things, especially jewelry. Your guy seems to think 'bigger is better' instead of realizing it's not your thing, so definitely not the better choice. Almost sounds like he got it to score points with others than with you. \"Look what he bought her!\" type shit. Maybe ask him if he'd like it if you got him some big weird gaudy ring that wasn't his style and expected him to wear it all the time. NTA. But deal with this now before it becomes a bigger issue with you both resenting the other over gifts.", "My dad bought my mom the White Diamonds perfume for Christmas. She hated it but used it all since it was a gift. She told him not to buy it for her again. Next Christmas, he bought it for her again. She said thank you and then went and returned it for something she would actually use. He never bought it for her again and is now very careful about what he buys her.", "This is terrible advice.

Hell, I might even assume that since they didn't bother taking the leaflets with them, they were something they weren't that interested in.", "They had us in the first half ngl", "She didn\u2019t just leave  leaflets \n\nShe also mentioned it to him", "She said she mentioned it to him", "He knew it sucked when he bought it because it was exactly the opposite of what she told him she wore", "This is a bot stealing a partial comment from further down the thread.", "Thought and care = money...", "It's his first time buying jewelry for someone, cut him some slack. I have truly the ugliest Tiffany chain bracelet that was my husband's first ever gift to me as someone who has only worn simple silver studs. His mother taught him the value of the item is more important than the style of the item and he had to learn with me that it wasn't the case. She will return anything you get her if she thinks it's too cheap because she \"doesn't want you to waste your money.\"", "Yeah, I agree with this. I (60f) have learned telling my BF that a gift is wonderful, but not my thing, is ok. We take it back. Sometimes I get something else, sometimes I don't. A long time ago, I decided to delight in giving others the perfect gift ( I am pretty damn good, too), and just accept gifts from others as intended- an expression of love.  BF needs to be told, and they can probably exchange it for something else.", "My partner and his family are the absolute worst gift givers on the planet.  As one whose love language is gifts, it just crushes me the lack of time, effort, or thought put into the gifts.  I now have a perpetual wish list for him to choose from and even then he will usually pick the 4-5 cheapest on the list.  The kids were even joking that they bet he didn't even read it, that he just went and picked the cheapest things.  We put is mini chainsaw on it for a big gift giving holiday.  Guess what I got.  The kids were rolling on the floor laughing.  I can understand the jewelry too.  I like the big chunky stuff.  When he does buy me jewelry (which I have asked him not to) he gets the little dainty stuff.

Well, to OP, of course they were, but to her spouse? Not at all. Is that his fault? Maybe - but I guarantee this isn't the first time OP made \"obvious hints\" that he didn't pick up on.\n\nWhy are you completely ignoring that OP also had a direct conversation with him? She didn't just hint, she explicitly told him that she likes \"small, delicate\" pieces and the colours she likes.\n\nThat isn't a hint or poor communication. OP was clear and he ignored it.", "If you were a little less dense you might figure it out.", "He ignored them because his fianc\u00e9e wearing small, delicate pieces of jewellery would not show off how wealthy he is. This was never about her. She\u2019s just the model.", "I wonder if the leaflets were the only indication? OP: did you ever actually have a conversation with him?", "Small and delicate is a subjective description. Everyone flaming the guy has not seen the necklace, small to you, him, and her could all be very different. Ripping him based on one side of the story shows a bigotry and lack of interest in the facts. He very well could be the asshole, us guys frequently are, but she also could be because perhaps she wanted one specific peice, hence the leaflets, and he, having mentioned talking about it for weeks could have been looking, shopping and saving to get what he felt she would love. Maybe next time just tell him which one she wants then she gets what she feels is correct and she is entitled to... Without more info, both are in the hot seat on this one.", "But since I\u2019m not less dense, then I need help figuring it out. So, are you going to help me or are you just replying to insult me?", "She says in the original post that she directly mentioned she liked small, delicate pieces & what colors she liked. The leaflets were a great idea too\u2026 if this dude spent even 30 seconds bothering to listen to her.", ">Small and delicate is a subjective description\n\nWere the leaflets also subjective?", "She said she mentioned it which could easily mean it was a very indirect hint, and I could easily imagine someone who leaves leaflets for someone instead of just being direct about their desires being as obscure as possible when mentioning their preference.", "He was the one that decided on the jewelry gift. She told him, after he had hinted that was the idea, that she liked small jewelry. Why would he not listen to her when she talked about jewelry after he had decided to buy her jewelry? It\u2019s not fun to get a gift when u have to walk the other person through the whole buying process. At that point, might as well buy it herself."]}
