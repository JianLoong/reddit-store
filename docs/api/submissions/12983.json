Outside of seeing the gift-giver, we never wear them again. Unfortunately for you, the out-of-touch gift giver is cohabitating with you. The truth may hurt, but it beats wearing something that makes you feel like a background dancer for Earth Wind and Fire.", "NTA. My mum has a whole box full of the same style jewelry from my dad that she hates. I swear it took her 30 years to tell him it wasn\u2019t her style. \n\nDon\u2019t fake it in your relationship - telling him \u2018I love you and I love that you put thought and care into my gift. It\u2019s not really my style, but I appreciate the thoughtfulness\u2019 etc. may hurt, but being lied to hurts more. Also maybe he could have returned or exchanged it if you told him sooner.", "NTA. You told him what you like, and he ignored it. Tbh, I want to give a small yta only for the fact that you didn't tell him immediately. If you had, he could've taken it back and got you a necklace of your choosing. It might be too late for that. Also, I think he's NTA cause he got you a nice gift, and he wanted to spoil you. Again a small yta for him for not listening to what you wanted.", "NTA - He hinted about jewelry, you gave him some easy to follow suggestions. He decided to get something that was the complete opposite of what you suggested. If this is a gift for you then a) he should have taken your tastes into consideration; and b) it should not come with any obligations to wear more often than you want to. \n\nPicking out jewelry for another person can be challenging. I am even willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on his selection. He may have thought you were asking for something delicate because you felt bad about him spending money on you. He may have gotten something more flashy than your usual style because he thought you hadn't worn something like that before because you couldn't afford to. But a gift for YOU should be about YOU. Try saying:\n\n\"I appreciate that you got me such a generous gift, but its not my style and not something I will wear regularly. Is it possible to exchange it for something that is more my style?\"\n\nHow he responds to that will tell you a lot about what is going on here. It may be that his \"gift\" had more to do with his ego than your happiness. (e.g. He wanted to get something big and flashy that shows off the money he is making and he wants you to wear it often so that people ask about it and you tell them what a generous gift he got you. He wants you to be a visual representation of his success.)", "NTA He can wear the pendant since he bought it to suit his tastes and not yours. \n\nFor his birthday, you can by something that you'd like, but he specifically said he doesn't. Oh, he doesn't like the present you picked? No, that can't be right. That logic worked for your birthday, after all.", "NTA.  He ignored your preferences to get a gift that suited his tastes, and seemingly left no room for you to gently/politely ask to exchange it.  You are not obligated to change your personal style for him.", "NTA\n\nMaybe he thought \u201coh, op really wants something bigger but she is being polite\u201d, maybe it was a mistake or maybe he just decided he liked what he got better or he wants something bigger that when people compliment you, you can say \u201cbf got it for me\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t like it and aren\u2019t going to wear. These can be difficult conversations, but will help your relationship in the long run if you have it. I\u2019d explain that it\u2019s a pretty necklace, it\u2019s just not your taste. You know he but effort and thought into it but you\u2019re not comfortable wearing it and perhaps you guys could go together and exchange it for something you\u2019d like. \n\nMe sometimes are funny with jewelry. They can understand not liking certain clothes, but not jewelry or handbags.\n\nGood luck.", "INFO: have you actually had a direct conversation about your taste and preferences?? Have you actually told him that his gift isnt in line with that and therefore you wont be wearing it often?? \n\nCos leaving leaflets in somebodys car is just about the worst for of communication in the modern world i can think of what", "NTA - You tell him what you liked and he chooses to ignore it", "NTA\n\nI will never understand why some partners do this, spending a shitload of money on something they've not already confirmed is to the recipient partner's tastes. It doesn't sound like you were particularly subtle when letting him know what you'd like, either. You should've had a discussion with him prior to now about the necklace, but I suppose you have the opportunity to do that now! If it can be returned/exchanged, he will most likely also be happier down the line if he takes advantage of that, so he can see you enjoying the gift he gave. If he decides to act like a douchanoe and make demands that you keep it, it can collect dust in your jewelry box. If it isn't exchangeable, you might consider wearing it a couple times a year to be a good sport, but I'd consider that optional on your part. He should've paid attention to what you said you wanted in the first place.", "NTA, it's generally kinda weird to insist a partner wear something she doesn't wanna wear, it's unfortunate he picked a bad gift but it happens, he can return it, sell it, or regift it. You could hang it up as room decoration. There are other ways to deal with his buyer's remorse than him pressuring you to wear something you dont wanna wear.,", "Nta - but I would keep the gift and the thought that came with it....if it has an accident and gets remade into something else, well....\n\nI've worn necklaces wrapped around my wrist as a bracelet before - could that work ?\n\nI know some people say its more honest to tell someone you don't like stuff, can you swap it etc but that kind of assumes the giftgiver didnt put a world of effort into choosing something for you. And its difficult to soften that blow if you go there.", "No it\u2019s his own fault, you told him what you wanted and he just ignored you. U ate.", "NTA OMG I *loath* the idea that good jewelery must be given by men.\n\nLuckily my husband knows my tastes, *but* he would also know better than to spend a substantial amount of money on a piece without consulting me.\n\nThe media has ingrained in men the idea that a woman will be *thrilled* with a gift of jewelery, *any* jewelery, really, as long as it\u2019s expensive. When, (to *me*, anyway), it would be more likely be a response of WTF is this when I open the little  box.\n\nYour fiancee got you something *he* likes, or a friend that went shopping with him liked, or that the sales person at the jewelery store convinced him any woman would *love*.\n\nWell, you *didn\u2019t*. And he didn\u2019t listen to you, even remotely, when you tried to guide him. This is not good. This is a red flag.\n\nYou need to sit him down and have a little discussion about how much this is not good. You have your own personality and style and opinions and they should be respected.\n\nMy husband suggests you explain it to him as if, for example, you buy him for his birthday something that is adjacent to but not quite right for whatever hobby he likes. Something nice, expensive, but not actually useful to him at *all*, and with only marginal thought put into it. Wouldn\u2019t he be *grateful*? Why isn\u2019t he *using* it?", "NTA. Men can be so clueless and/or careless about stuff like that, that you have to clobber them over the head with it (and sometimes that doesn't even work). The leaflets and hints weren't enough here.", "NTA. Sometimes our loved ones buy us well intended gifts that we just don't like. Or cant use often. That's not your fault. You accepted the gift graciously, wore it to be polite and kept it cuz it means something to you.  That's all he can expect. \n\nMy bf sometimes gets me expensive things and gets upset or teases me for not using them. Like the 700 dollar vaporizer he got me. I love it, was fun to play around with. But uses up alot of product and isnt something I can use multiple times a day realistically. Took me forever to get him to accept that I loved the gift,  it just wasnt going to replace my normal routine. He likes to maximize and use the most up to date stuff for everything. Now he gives me less of a fuss when I pick and choose when to use gifts, because he gets thought goes into everything I do.", "NTA. It was a very nice gesture of your fiance, but ultimately not a considerate one. Maybe try to sit him down and explain it in further detail - let him know you love the fact that he wanted to treat you with something expensive, but it's not something you can enjoy as it doesn't match anything you own previously... and see if it's possible to exchange it for something that's more tailored to your style. The fact that he didn't take your hints and suggestion into account from the start is what landed you here in the end", "YTA. Not because you didn't wear it but because you didn't have an honest conversation with him after he gifted it to you. Jewlery is returnable.   \n\nYou plan on spending the rest of your life with this man.  Do you want him to continue to waste money on things you won't wear?   Instead of waiting for him to notice you should have told him.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that would sit in your jewellery box he should have gotten something that fitted your style. It's not that hard, and if it was he could have gone shopping with you (or looked at what you wear!)", "Yes. Your neck is not part of your body - it\u2019s a display case for your partner\u2019s disposable wealth. You should wear what he buys you, regardless of your preference. And in tight times, he can rent it out as ad space, like a sports uniform. \n\nWait\u2026 no, that\u2019s not actually the case. He bought you the thing. That\u2019s your thing now. You get to decide which of your things you\u2019ll wear, when. It\u2019s that whole dressing yourself thing. As your partner, he can say \u201cI like it when you wear X\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t like it as much when you wear Y\u201d. He\u2019s allowed to have preferences. But if he bought you a thing you don\u2019t like, that\u2019s just money down the drain. You\u2019re not obliged to wear things you dislike because he bought them for you, because you\u2019re a person, not a doll. \n\nNTA.", "YTA and he's silly for wasting money on you.\n\nThis is why it is silly to buy jewelry. Spend $500 on something that's maybe worth $50.  Have someone else tell you it sucks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When you get someone a gift, you need to keep in mind what they would actually like. Your partner dismissed this OP, that's on them.

You're not in the wrong OP, all of this is just unfortunate.", "NTA my ex was bad for that\u2026 sold all that stuff after the breakup. Husband was wise enough to get my input on my engagement ring and wedding band.", "Info: You've been leaving hints and never have you been direct about it? Not once?", "NAH.\n\nWhen you want a raise at work do you leave printouts of dollar bills around your cubicle? (\"I told my boss I liked the crisp, green ones\") If my wife left leaflets in my car I would assume it was junk mail she didn't want to bring into the house.\n\nIf you have particular tastes about jewelry, do everyone a favour and explicitly point out specific items that you want.", " NTA.

But that\u2019s literally just your style. Mine too.", "NTA, OP.  But sometimes, people are better with direct communication (I don\u2019t know if you circled or otherwise marked anything in the little leaflets or not - if you did, then there\u2019s no excuse and homie should\u2019ve paid attention).\n\nBack when my husband and I had just gotten together, the subject of my taste in jewelry came up, specifically wrt engagement rings and wedding bands. I\u2019m very easy to please, so I really didn\u2019t have much guidance and at that point, I didn\u2019t think it would be pressing just yet, bc it would be a minute before purchasing those things. Just gave him a general idea of what I like - unique/interesting is always paramount, don\u2019t need/want a huge stone, I\u2019ve got tiny/skinny fingers (according to my mother, I have no knuckles lol), so probably a thin band, etc. Somehow, just based on that, and not too long after that conversation, he picked the absolute most perfect set in the world for me. \n\nLike I said, some people are just bad at that kind of thing without direct communication. Perhaps next time, he\u2019ll pay attention. And next time, maybe reiterate your taste (and let him know it really isn\u2019t about budget, it\u2019s about your actual taste), or if you\u2019ve been eyeballing something, just tell him \u201cthis one,\u201d or \u201csomething like this,\u201d while showing/describing the exact features you like about it. If his love language is gifts, he\u2019ll want to do a good job, pay attention, and show that he cares about who you are.", ">Jewlery is returnable. \n\nDepends where you get it from sometimes. Some places will only return for store credit, which limits your options a bit", "I agree. Op YTA for not actually talking to him about this, and then lying to him instead of telling him you didnt like it. He's only slightly an ah for not asking you what you'd like.", "Agreed.\n\nDid he miss the hints? Yes. Were they obvious? Well, to OP, of course they were, but to her spouse? Not at all. Is that his fault? Maybe - but I guarantee this isn't the first time OP made \"obvious hints\" that he didn't pick up on.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with OP not liking the necklace - heck, she might even like it and not wear it because it doesn't go with anything. That's a conversation (preferably right away) so it can be exchanged. Or better yet, a straight-forward conversation before hand. Maybe suggesting they go to the jewelry store together to pick it out?\n\nAs it stands, this scenario is just going to repeat in one way or another. I guess it might be E-S-H, but given we don't have both perspectives I'm ok with assuming it's YTA.", "So why did he ignore the leaflets and your stated tastes? He wasted the money, not you.\n\nI'd be shocked if this is the only example of him doing something \"nice\" for you, but not something you want.", "OP told him her preferences and he ignored them.  And then pitched a fit and demanded she wear it even though it\u2019s not her style.  Are you saying OP is obligated to regularly wear jewelry she dislikes?", "The dude clearly did not take the hints. This isn\u2019t difficult to comprehend."]}
