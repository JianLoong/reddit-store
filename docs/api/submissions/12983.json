Outside of seeing the gift-giver, we never wear them again. Unfortunately for you, the out-of-touch gift giver is cohabitating with you. The truth may hurt, but it beats wearing something that makes you feel like a background dancer for Earth Wind and Fire.", "NTA. My mum has a whole box full of the same style jewelry from my dad that she hates. I swear it took her 30 years to tell him it wasn\u2019t her style. \n\nDon\u2019t fake it in your relationship - telling him \u2018I love you and I love that you put thought and care into my gift. It\u2019s not really my style, but I appreciate the thoughtfulness\u2019 etc. may hurt, but being lied to hurts more. Also maybe he could have returned or exchanged it if you told him sooner.", "NTA. You told him what you like, and he ignored it. Tbh, I want to give a small yta only for the fact that you didn't tell him immediately. If you had, he could've taken it back and got you a necklace of your choosing. It might be too late for that. Also, I think he's NTA cause he got you a nice gift, and he wanted to spoil you. Again a small yta for him for not listening to what you wanted.", "NTA - He hinted about jewelry, you gave him some easy to follow suggestions. He decided to get something that was the complete opposite of what you suggested. If this is a gift for you then a) he should have taken your tastes into consideration; and b) it should not come with any obligations to wear more often than you want to. \n\nPicking out jewelry for another person can be challenging. I am even willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on his selection. He may have thought you were asking for something delicate because you felt bad about him spending money on you. He may have gotten something more flashy than your usual style because he thought you hadn't worn something like that before because you couldn't afford to. But a gift for YOU should be about YOU. Try saying:\n\n\"I appreciate that you got me such a generous gift, but its not my style and not something I will wear regularly. Is it possible to exchange it for something that is more my style?\"\n\nHow he responds to that will tell you a lot about what is going on here. It may be that his \"gift\" had more to do with his ego than your happiness. (e.g. He wanted to get something big and flashy that shows off the money he is making and he wants you to wear it often so that people ask about it and you tell them what a generous gift he got you. He wants you to be a visual representation of his success.)", "NTA He can wear the pendant since he bought it to suit his tastes and not yours. \n\nFor his birthday, you can by something that you'd like, but he specifically said he doesn't. Oh, he doesn't like the present you picked? No, that can't be right. That logic worked for your birthday, after all.", "NTA.  He ignored your preferences to get a gift that suited his tastes, and seemingly left no room for you to gently/politely ask to exchange it.  You are not obligated to change your personal style for him.", "NTA\n\nMaybe he thought \u201coh, op really wants something bigger but she is being polite\u201d, maybe it was a mistake or maybe he just decided he liked what he got better or he wants something bigger that when people compliment you, you can say \u201cbf got it for me\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t like it and aren\u2019t going to wear. These can be difficult conversations, but will help your relationship in the long run if you have it. I\u2019d explain that it\u2019s a pretty necklace, it\u2019s just not your taste. You know he but effort and thought into it but you\u2019re not comfortable wearing it and perhaps you guys could go together and exchange it for something you\u2019d like. \n\nMe sometimes are funny with jewelry. They can understand not liking certain clothes, but not jewelry or handbags.\n\nGood luck.", "INFO: have you actually had a direct conversation about your taste and preferences?? Have you actually told him that his gift isnt in line with that and therefore you wont be wearing it often?? \n\nCos leaving leaflets in somebodys car is just about the worst for of communication in the modern world i can think of what", "NTA - You tell him what you liked and he chooses to ignore it", "NTA\n\nI will never understand why some partners do this, spending a shitload of money on something they've not already confirmed is to the recipient partner's tastes. It doesn't sound like you were particularly subtle when letting him know what you'd like, either. You should've had a discussion with him prior to now about the necklace, but I suppose you have the opportunity to do that now! If it can be returned/exchanged, he will most likely also be happier down the line if he takes advantage of that, so he can see you enjoying the gift he gave. If he decides to act like a douchanoe and make demands that you keep it, it can collect dust in your jewelry box. If it isn't exchangeable, you might consider wearing it a couple times a year to be a good sport, but I'd consider that optional on your part. He should've paid attention to what you said you wanted in the first place.", "NTA, it's generally kinda weird to insist a partner wear something she doesn't wanna wear, it's unfortunate he picked a bad gift but it happens, he can return it, sell it, or regift it. You could hang it up as room decoration. There are other ways to deal with his buyer's remorse than him pressuring you to wear something you dont wanna wear.,", "Nta - but I would keep the gift and the thought that came with it....if it has an accident and gets remade into something else, well....\n\nI've worn necklaces wrapped around my wrist as a bracelet before - could that work ?\n\nI know some people say its more honest to tell someone you don't like stuff, can you swap it etc but that kind of assumes the giftgiver didnt put a world of effort into choosing something for you. And its difficult to soften that blow if you go there.", "No it\u2019s his own fault, you told him what you wanted and he just ignored you. U ate.", "NTA OMG I *loath* the idea that good jewelery must be given by men.\n\nLuckily my husband knows my tastes, *but* he would also know better than to spend a substantial amount of money on a piece without consulting me.\n\nThe media has ingrained in men the idea that a woman will be *thrilled* with a gift of jewelery, *any* jewelery, really, as long as it\u2019s expensive. When, (to *me*, anyway), it would be more likely be a response of WTF is this when I open the little  box.\n\nYour fiancee got you something *he* likes, or a friend that went shopping with him liked, or that the sales person at the jewelery store convinced him any woman would *love*.\n\nWell, you *didn\u2019t*. And he didn\u2019t listen to you, even remotely, when you tried to guide him. This is not good. This is a red flag.\n\nYou need to sit him down and have a little discussion about how much this is not good. You have your own personality and style and opinions and they should be respected.\n\nMy husband suggests you explain it to him as if, for example, you buy him for his birthday something that is adjacent to but not quite right for whatever hobby he likes. Something nice, expensive, but not actually useful to him at *all*, and with only marginal thought put into it. Wouldn\u2019t he be *grateful*? Why isn\u2019t he *using* it?", "NTA. Men can be so clueless and/or careless about stuff like that, that you have to clobber them over the head with it (and sometimes that doesn't even work). The leaflets and hints weren't enough here.", "NTA. Sometimes our loved ones buy us well intended gifts that we just don't like. Or cant use often. That's not your fault. You accepted the gift graciously, wore it to be polite and kept it cuz it means something to you.  That's all he can expect. \n\nMy bf sometimes gets me expensive things and gets upset or teases me for not using them. Like the 700 dollar vaporizer he got me. I love it, was fun to play around with. But uses up alot of product and isnt something I can use multiple times a day realistically. Took me forever to get him to accept that I loved the gift,  it just wasnt going to replace my normal routine. He likes to maximize and use the most up to date stuff for everything. Now he gives me less of a fuss when I pick and choose when to use gifts, because he gets thought goes into everything I do.", "NTA. It was a very nice gesture of your fiance, but ultimately not a considerate one. Maybe try to sit him down and explain it in further detail - let him know you love the fact that he wanted to treat you with something expensive, but it's not something you can enjoy as it doesn't match anything you own previously... and see if it's possible to exchange it for something that's more tailored to your style. The fact that he didn't take your hints and suggestion into account from the start is what landed you here in the end", "YTA. Not because you didn't wear it but because you didn't have an honest conversation with him after he gifted it to you. Jewlery is returnable.   \n\nYou plan on spending the rest of your life with this man.  Do you want him to continue to waste money on things you won't wear?   Instead of waiting for him to notice you should have told him.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that would sit in your jewellery box he should have gotten something that fitted your style. It's not that hard, and if it was he could have gone shopping with you (or looked at what you wear!)", "Yes. Your neck is not part of your body - it\u2019s a display case for your partner\u2019s disposable wealth. You should wear what he buys you, regardless of your preference. And in tight times, he can rent it out as ad space, like a sports uniform. \n\nWait\u2026 no, that\u2019s not actually the case. He bought you the thing. That\u2019s your thing now. You get to decide which of your things you\u2019ll wear, when. It\u2019s that whole dressing yourself thing. As your partner, he can say \u201cI like it when you wear X\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t like it as much when you wear Y\u201d. He\u2019s allowed to have preferences. But if he bought you a thing you don\u2019t like, that\u2019s just money down the drain. You\u2019re not obliged to wear things you dislike because he bought them for you, because you\u2019re a person, not a doll. \n\nNTA.", "YTA and he's silly for wasting money on you.\n\nThis is why it is silly to buy jewelry. Spend $500 on something that's maybe worth $50.  Have someone else tell you it sucks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But sometimes, people are better with direct communication (I don\u2019t know if you circled or otherwise marked anything in the little leaflets or not - if you did, then there\u2019s no excuse and homie should\u2019ve paid attention).\n\nBack when my husband and I had just gotten together, the subject of my taste in jewelry came up, specifically wrt engagement rings and wedding bands. I\u2019m very easy to please, so I really didn\u2019t have much guidance and at that point, I didn\u2019t think it would be pressing just yet, bc it would be a minute before purchasing those things. Just gave him a general idea of what I like - unique/interesting is always paramount, don\u2019t need/want a huge stone, I\u2019ve got tiny/skinny fingers (according to my mother, I have no knuckles lol), so probably a thin band, etc. Somehow, just based on that, and not too long after that conversation, he picked the absolute most perfect set in the world for me. \n\nLike I said, some people are just bad at that kind of thing without direct communication. Perhaps next time, he\u2019ll pay attention. And next time, maybe reiterate your taste (and let him know it really isn\u2019t about budget, it\u2019s about your actual taste), or if you\u2019ve been eyeballing something, just tell him \u201cthis one,\u201d or \u201csomething like this,\u201d while showing/describing the exact features you like about it. If his love language is gifts, he\u2019ll want to do a good job, pay attention, and show that he cares about who you are.\n\nETA: if it\u2019s too late to exchange it for something you like but neither of you wants to sell it, it might end up growing on you. It may be suited to some things you own that you don\u2019t wear too often for whatever reason, but sometimes wear when you\u2019re feeling like you want to wear something funky/flashy. Just something to keep in mind.", ">Jewlery is returnable. \n\nDepends where you get it from sometimes. Some places will only return for store credit, which limits your options a bit", "I agree.

He's only slightly an ah for not asking you what you'd like.", "Agreed.\n\nDid he miss the hints? Yes. Were they obvious? Well, to OP, of course they were, but to her spouse? Not at all. Is that his fault? Maybe - but I guarantee this isn't the first time OP made \"obvious hints\" that he didn't pick up on.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with OP not liking the necklace - heck, she might even like it and not wear it because it doesn't go with anything. That's a conversation (preferably right away) so it can be exchanged. Or better yet, a straight-forward conversation before hand. Maybe suggesting they go to the jewelry store together to pick it out?\n\nAs it stands, this scenario is just going to repeat in one way or another. I guess it might be E-S-H, but given we don't have both perspectives I'm ok with assuming it's YTA.", "So why did he ignore the leaflets and your stated tastes?

You should have told him immediately that this wasn't a piece you saw yourself wearing due to it not being at all your style.

He\u2019s never seen me in gold.

I explained I\u2019m not upset and I don\u2019t want it returned or anything even if it could be, but please in the future if thinking of jewelry for me stick to silver and he apologized for not noticing the preference and promised to keep that in mind.", "NTA- you made yourself very clear and he ignored everything you said. It\u2019s not rude to not wear something you neither like nor asked for, however, it might be worth explaining that while you appreciate his efforts to buy you something beautiful, it\u2019s not your style and you don\u2019t want him to waste his money on a gift that you won\u2019t use.", "NTA. My husband\u2019s taste is jewellery is awful but my brother\u2019s in great. It took a gentle conversation but now he double checks with my bro before he buys anything so it\u2019s still a surprise.

His heart was in the right place and he tried, but you don\u2019t like it and that\u2019s absolutely fine.", "NTA when people do this it seems super controlling. First of all if he pays attention to you at all he should know what jewelry you usually wear. If he\u2019s oblivious he could easily look in your jewelry box to see what you tend to wear BUT you specifically told him. He got the opposite of what you specifically said you liked. Purposely then gets upset when you don\u2019t wear it. Seems like a power move. Yeah it\u2019s easy to accidentally get something someone isn\u2019t fond of but this seems extremely purposeful. Like how can you get your partner something so off base? It would be different if you weren\u2019t a regular jewelry wearer and he was just taking a shot in the dark.

He'll always appreciate that.", "NAH.\n\nHe picked jewellery for you which he thought you would like and you didn\u2019t - a communication issue.\n\nHowever, and beware - be careful about criticising his choices; he picked you after all.

If you have no access to water, a boat is a bit useless even if it's expensive. You would have to go out of your way to use said boat even though you don't like it.

I was in the same situation a couple years ago. I dropped big money on a custom diamond necklace for my wife. She never wears it. It's not her style. I knew better too. She's always been very particular about her jewelry and she told me beforehand to not buy her jewelry because she's so picky. It's not like I did it on purpose. I was just trying to be nice.

Don't know why I was stupid about it.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re marrying this guy, so he\u2019s going to have to learn that he can\u2019t just style you however he wants and expect you to wear it because he spent a lot of money on it.

I didn\u2019t actually love the ring he had picked, and instead we designed a ring together and I have never seen a ring I liked more.", "NTA\n\nYou were specific in what you liked and he still chose something that wasn't anywhere near what you would wear.\n\nI had an ex do this once. He was sweet about it though. He just returned it and picked something else out that met the perimeters.", "I\u2019m saying NTA because whilst his intentions were good, jewellery is such a personal choice that anybody who wants to buy jewellery for someone needs to research the recipient\u2019s taste and style very thoroughly. You wore it once, that\u2019s enough to show gratitude. Although I think perhaps you should not have worn it at all, so you could have gently and lovingly discussed returning it.", "NTA.

No one should be obligated to wear/use/display a gift they don\u2019t like. But if you don\u2019t, it hurts the giver\u2019s feelings, since they put thought and money into the gift. You also run the risk of being viewed as picky or ungrateful if you are too detailed with your gift desires ahead of time. There\u2019s just no great way around it. Best thing to do is exhibit appreciation when it\u2019s gifted, but be honest so that they can hopefully return the item and get their money back. No one wins if they\u2019re out money and you\u2019re stuck with a gift you don\u2019t want.", "I mean, he was trying to be nice and surprise u with something u didn't think of which I think we can agree was well intended, the risk is of course that u wouldn't like it.

My main go-to is a little silver dagger necklace. I don't wear rings, and I have about ten ear piercings, so I just wear nickel free studs from Target and shit, because the amount of earrings that have fallen out of my ears and been lost forever is astronomical. If they were all nicer jewels or gold, I'd have lost hundreds if not thousands of dollars over the years.

He was so proud of it when he gave it to me for my birthday. I hated it!! It wasn't my taste at all and the last thing I wanted to do was wear a necklace that was connected to his job.

My daughter can\u2019t wait until she\u2019s big enough to wear it every day, especially since her dad died and that ring is what started us as a family.

My MIL used to do this to me, she would buy jewelry clothing, scarves etc. for me that were 100% HER style (a 70 yr old woman) and looked nothing like anything I had ever worn in their presence. Literally the only jewelry I wear is my wedding ring and a delicate necklace that has tiny round discs with the initials of myself, spouse, and child. One time she got me the most gaudy bracelet that looked like bad costume jewelry form the 80\u2019s, and the next day we were all leaving to see a movie and she totally pulled the \u201coh why aren\u2019t you wearing the bracelet I got you?\u201d Lol lucky my FIL is the real MVP and was like \u201cKaren would you leave her the hell alone\u201d \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnyway\u2014I personally find it tacky when people give gifts and then corner the recipient about said gift (not using or wearing it or whatever). A truly considerate gift is given with the *recipient* and their needs and tastes in mind. And if the gift giver takes it personally when the recipient doesn\u2019t wear or use the item as often as they expected, I think there\u2019s something a bit inherently selfish in that. It\u2019s okay to feel bad if your gift isn\u2019t loved, but it is also an opportunity to learn and look inward (did I actually take the time to learn about the recipients tastes or interests? Was I overlooking polite and subtle signs from the recipient that they wanted something different? Was I giving this gift to make *ME* feel good or make them feel good?).", "The fact, that he completely ignored what you told him speak volumes.

Only problem he never seemed to realize, I usually don't wear necklaces. I thanked him for the great gift and told him about my dislike for necklaces and if he could have it changed for a wristband. He did and no problem at all. I love it and wear it daily.", "Communication. Celebrating 40 years married this weekend.

I like dangly earrings. Especially long dangly earrings but even short dangles will do. I have a set of Black Hills gold rose design earrings and necklace, topaz earrings with matching necklace and a set of opal earrings and matching necklace from my husband. Earrings are all studs. No dangle at all. Plus, they have no safety backs and are short posts. I have somewhat thick ear lobes and posts that are too short cause my ears to get infected, possibly because the backs are pinched tight and do not allow any air flow around the back. And it would be way too easy to lose them. They have been in my closet for at least 20 years. They are not lacking in design. Pretty scrolls around the gems, or shaped petals making the roses. If the posts could be removed and the earrings somehow attached as a dangle on a plain gold stud, I would wear them, but as they are, nope.

Gave all to me immediately. SIL was a Feb birthstone, so I traded BIL for something he had but didn't want. I had a second piercing to my ears specifically to wear the diamond studs. Was always checking them in the morning to make sure they were still snug. This was fine for 1 years, when I lost one. Took the remaining one to a jewelry store to have the diamond put into a safety setting. Wore that diamond earring every day for the next 22 years. Then I mentioned it to my sister one day, about having had the standard post replaced with a security post because she was concerned about one of her pairs of earrings. Wouldn't you know, 4 days later, the earring came loose and fell out. No idea where it was. Losing a piece of jewelry is usually no big deal for me, but this was a special piece of jewelry, and it still bothers me, months later.", "I agree.

I check to make sure they're snug in the mornings but they still fall out a lot. It's because my main lobe piercings used to be stretched and I wore plugs, so now sometimes certain posts and earring backs just slip through and I don't notice.
