Unfortunately, it's not really your job to teach these kids how to \"grow up,\" and your rules ... which are only going to be enforced sporadically when you babysit ... aren't really going to help.

None of these things should be difficult for physically and mentally capable children of the noted ages, outside of MAYBE mopping depending on the set up at hand. \n\nIf there are diagnoses being left out, I'd change my answer, but IMO as it stands, these children have been neglected by their parent and you're stepping in to raise them into regular, functioning people. \nI don't see it as expecting them to be fully independent either, you're not even asking them to use the stove", "also, if they\u2019re old enough to catch an attitude with me about being told to do things, then theyre old enough to do them.", "Nta do they act like at school??????", "NTA, and I would never have those brats in my house at all.", "NTA, but you're only watching them from \"time to time.\"  I don't think your sporadic lessons will do much if they can just go home and Mummy will wait on them hand and foot.\n\nYou may want to reach out to CPS (or the equivalent in your country) to share your concerns.", "\"These are just the actual things that as human beings they should know.\"\n\nI think your list is too long.\n\nBut I agree it is appropriate to act to make it longer.

Start small- they shouldn\u2019t be making all their meals and cleaning the whole house day 1. I would try rewarding them for doing things on their own so they\u2019re getting positive reinforcements and not just negative ones. If they cry, just ignore it.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my 10 year old is pretty responsible and independent but she is definitely going through a phase where she won\u2019t shower, change clothes, etc unless I tell her to. That\u2019s fairly normal behavior for those ages. With time, comes hygiene. Until then, it\u2019s not that big of a deal to direct them towards those tasks by simply asking them to do it and ignoring the cries.", "You definitely shouldn\u2019t be a parent if you think making a 10 year old breakfast is coddling them \u2026 Jesus", "NTA.\n\nIf your MIL doesn't like the way you babysit her kids then she doesn't have to use you guys as a babysitter.\n\nAs far as your techniques, I don't think you are being harsh, I think you are being more of a parent to them than their actual parent. You're empowering them and teaching them life skills that they need to know. They are old enough to figure out how to do something once they realize nobody else will do it for them. And you say that you are right there to keep them from *actually* starving or getting harmed. \n\nThe fact that you are considering whether you are being a bad person or not tells me that you are most likely not, as bad people don't typically consider whether or not they are doing something bad.", "NTA.", "YTA - Soft yta but it sounds like you expect them to be completely independent and are ready to let them sink because they aren't. You are right, that at this age they should be getting there, particularly not being able to pick out their own clothes.

I'd stop watching them and wait for the real world to catch up to them", "Probably not gonna be popular but YTA, because you're the adult in the situation. Stop babysitting them if you can't stand them. Sure, these kids are a mess but that's because they're not being properly parented. If you, as an adult, know that that triggers you, just don't babysit them. If you insist on babysitting them, figure out how to do so with some compassion.", "YTA \n\nHas it ever occurred to you that a more gentle approach could reap more rewards? \n\nTeach them. Be kind. Set up a routine and make a list of necessary tasks they need to do before playing. Show them how to make their own breakfast and how to clean up afterwards. Set a shower schedule. Write down everything and post it on the fridge. Just don't overwhelm them.

You\u2019re NTA for trying to help these kids gain basic life skills.", "That's absolutely heartbreaking tbh. \n\nIf you suspect them, I'd say be gentle and maybe more understanding with certain items on your list, like showering, and the social skills. \nHOWEVER, even autistic kids grow up and become independent adults that need these skills, so I don't think any of what you're requiring should stop completely. \n\nGood luck and, I hope you know you are a legitimately good person for trying with these kiddos", "Thats really sad for them :(", "Well when they ask for guidance, guide them!
