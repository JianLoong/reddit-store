My husband and I drove some 7-8 hours away to see his family for Christmas. Unfortunately, I had some of that magical pregnancy stomach upset the morning we left. Since pregnancy has you living on a knife\u2019s edge between horrible constipation and a convincing dramatization of the Oregon Trail dysentery, I didn\u2019t want to take Imodium and back myself up. I was doing pretty well until my baby decided to use my bladder as her yoga ball. \n\nNo big deal. We had to get gas anyways, so we stopped at a big chain gas station on the East Coast. I hurried off to the bathroom while my husband took care of the dog and filling the car. There were 3 stalls, 2 regular and 1 accessible. One of the regular stalls was roped off and out of order. There was a very small line. I was behind another person and then this old lady walked in behind me. She asked if there was a line and I nodded. She was using a cane and was elderly but not extremely so. \n\nThe regular stall opened up and the woman in front of me went in. Then the accessible stall (being the only one left) opened up and I went for it. The person who came out of that stall was not visibly disabled, they did not have mobility aids - I know invisible disabilities exist and am not trying to split hairs here but this is relevant to the story. I was in the stall for about 5 minutes, essentially applying a power sander in the form of cheap, single-ply TP to my poor, already sore backside. \n\nI exited and the old lady was still standing there tapping her cane in annoyance. She stared at me like I had just kicked her dog and yelled at me that, \u201cHandicapped stalls are ONLY EVER for the handicapped!!!!!\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything to the person who had just exited the same stall before me. \n\nI am a pretty shy person and was fairly stunned. I looked down and muttered I was heavily pregnant. She yelled that being pregnant wasn\u2019t an excuse, that she had been pregnant like most other women and was never in her life so rude as to steal resources from the disabled. At that point I had finished washing my hands and noped out of there. \n\nNow I\u2019m worried I\u2019m an ableist asshole. But, I\u2019m genuinely confused. Was I supposed to let her cut me in line? If she had asked to go ahead because the accessible stall was the only one she could use, I probably would have let her go and waited. Likewise if she had a walker, wheelchair, or another cumbersome mobility aid that would definitely not have fit into a stall. \n\nWhat\u2019s more is that the baby changing station was in the accessible stall, so it\u2019s not like it was exclusively intended for those with disabilities. If I had an infant, would she have still expected me not to use that stall just because I\u2019m not disabled?\n\nSo, Reddit, what\u2019s the etiquette on these sorts of things?", "created_utc": 1703777275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18swhjg/aita_for_not_offering_the_accessible_stall_to_an/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Compare it to the wording for an Accessible restroom stall. The word reserved is not used. Only accessable is used.

That stall is as much for you as it is for anyone else. It is there so that people with disabilities have an accessible stall, not only for people with disabilities. It's not like handicapped parking where you need a placard and sign off from a doctor. \n\nIt's always nice to offer it to someone with a mobility aid behind you in line if it doesn't present difficulty for you, but this doesn't sound like that situation and you wouldn't be TA anyhow if you didn't offer. If the woman was in a hurry for the toilet and wanted to jump in line she could have asked, but when there is a line typically all stalls will be used and if you need an accessible stall you have to wait for that. \n\nNote too that some places ONLY have accessible restrooms.

OP was heavily pregnant and clearly needed the space, which she certainly has every right to use and clearly waited patiently to use like a reasonable adult.\n\nThose stalls are *accessible* to those who need them, not *reserved* for anybody in particular. If 5 people in wheelchairs all needed to pee; who gets priority? Does one get to yell at the other for not waiting? Which disability should be prioritized, canes, walkers, or wheelchairs? You tell me. Nothing in life is that simple, and all disabilities aren't visually obvious. So, to be yelling at someone and assuming they aren't disabled when you are is just poor etiquette in any situation. It doesn't even matter.\n\nYou and I are clearly talking about two very different situations.", "Exactly! I think you had every reason to use that stall", "I wouldn\u2019t be upset for any able bodied person about to shit themselves using the handicapped stall, either. I\u2019ve been there and sorry\u2026handicapped people can also wait patiently.", "NTA. Used to be, the only baby changing stations were in the disabled stalls. And I certainly used them when I had my 2 kiddos with me .My husband was disabled.\n\nGentle suggestion- use the immodium. Also have hubby install a bidet at home. They are amazing.", "There's no one as entitled as an old lady", "No community bathrooms with stalls are my chosen zen spot, so it amazes me when I wait several minutes with no movement in there and finally say something.", "I\u2019m disabled and living in the UK, where the system is a bit different than the US - disabled stalls/toilets are only for disabled people, and they\u2019re accessed with a key. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should have given up your spot in the queue because you\u2019re pregnant and were on the verge of having an accident. But if you weren\u2019t pregnant and it weren\u2019t an emergency, then yes it\u2019s reasonable to let the disabled person in front of you. People get VERY weird about this on Reddit, but I can say as a visibly disabled person I\u2019ve ended up waiting for the loo more in the five years since my injury than in the entire other forty years of my life combined. I can\u2019t use a regular stall at all, so I have to wait for the accessible stall to be available - which means that in most US bathrooms I can only use one out of every five or every ten stalls. It\u2019s very painful for me to stand and wait in line, and while I\u2019m not expecting to never wait for a toilet, it sucks that I usually end up waiting longer than everyone else when it\u2019s more painful for me. \n\nReally, the Us accessible bathroom system sucks and there in an ideal world there would be enough accessible stalls for everyone that needs them - but there aren\u2019t, so if you can wait then it\u2019s kind to let disabled people use the stalls that are created for them.", "I have had to practically stand over the toilet to get the door to close in some  places! It's hilarious if you are in good form but when you are hot and sweaty ans hungry and you really just nees to pee it can be emotionally challenging!!", "My heart goes out to you. My husband\u2019s sibling has IBS and they have such miserable days. There are few things worse than clenching with everything you have and praying you can make the toilet in time.", "Maybe they\u2019re out there using an accessible stall every chance they get just as a middle finger to their charming mother.", "So much this. Also, restroom stalls could really just be made bigger in general in a lot of places. Why not have all the features of an accessible stall just be standard? They are superior in just about every way to the average stall.\n\nAlso, really sorry to hear that this is something you go through. Not every disabled person or person struggling with a debilitating issue looks like they are. Some people seem fine when they are not. Some people are disabled and struggle to actually get approved for disability. (I am in the US saying all this BTW.)\n\nPeople really just need to stop assuming shit about folks they don't know.", "We have a bidet at home and I was so glad to get back to it. I seriously could have hugged it. \n\nDoes the Imodium not cause a rebound effect? That\u2019s why I\u2019m scared of it. The only time I\u2019ve used it was when I had food poisoning at week 5 and everything went through me within 30 minutes. Being constipated during pregnancy is one of the worst feelings. Your organs are already compressed and full of baby, adding on more fullness and pressure to that is hell. I was constipated at a friend\u2019s wedding a few weeks ago and I wanted to drop dead.", "I am also in the UK. There are some places with disabled loos that are totally separate. But almost every public restroom I've used also has at least one accessible stall that is larger, and usually the door opens out instead of in. These are free for anyone to use at any time like a regular stall.", "Thank you for your perspective! Of course, it is different in the US as you mentioned. I would not have used the stall if it was solely intended for disabled people but that was not the case. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to wait to use the toilet, that is never fun regardless. There do need to be more accessible stalls, I think. If you\u2019re ever travelling in the US, larger truck stops and huge gas station chains (Buccee\u2019s comes to mind) often have several accessible stalls instead of just the one.", "I run cold except in my sleep, which is odd for me. I\u2019m also glad to be getting through the third trimester in the winter so I don\u2019t have to worry too much about becoming a hot, sweaty blimp. Props to those with summer or early fall due dates. \n\nThe hunger is not fun. Neither is the crazy indigestion that just happens for seemingly no reason? Don\u2019t eat. Indigestion. Eat. Indigestion. Eat bland food or a small meal. Indigestion. I\u2019ve been on meds for it since week 7 but it\u2019s predictably gotten worse as baby has grown.", "It is what it is, and I could be a lot worse off! But I've definitely had situations where I have not been given gluten free food when I've been out and ordered it, and had disastrous consequences! It is definitely embarrassing and humiliating though. It's why I'm now thrilled I have a radar key. I use it very infrequently but it's reassuring to have!", "If I was a betting person I would put that on my bingo card \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Lol. I just got one for Christmas, just a basic one, and it's amazing. My son got it for me, and installed it. I love my kids.\n\nImmodium, for me, does not. I am a colon cancer survivor, and have bad days every once in a while. I will let nature happen for a couple of rounds, then take immodium, cause I don't want to run on the toilet every 5 minutes.", "Pregnancy is not that fun. It's wonderful growing a human (who ia currently kicking my ribs) but it's incredibly hard work and all the little things can add up to make a less than pleasant time.", "Every time we travel my husband bemoans the lack of bidets. He jokes that we should bring a portable one when we leave home and after my experience with the gas station TP, I am inclined to agree. \n\nI might give it a try. I am at the tail end of the poo train today still.", "Good luck. And congrats for your future baby."]}
