So I (22M) live in Amsterdam, and my main means of transportation is by bicycle. If any of you have ever been to or seen/read something about Amsterdam, you may be aware of the fact that it's basically the cycling capital of the world. There are bicycle lanes everywhere, and some streets are only accessible by foot or bicycle. There are millions of cyclists in this city, both tourists and people who live here alike.\n\nSo this is where the story begins. I live just outside the city center of Amsterdam and needed to go into the city center. Now, because it's summer, there are so many tourists who come here. The streets can get crammed with people because of how many tourists there are. Anyways, when I got to the center, I had to turn off onto a narrow alley with a wide bicycle lane in the middle but with very narrow sidewalks for pedestrians. I have made this trip many times, so I was well aware that tourists sometimes decide to walk on the bicycle lane, so to be careful, I decided to slow down in case there were tourists who couldn't see me so I could ring my bell to warn them of my approach.\n\nI saw that a family was about to cross, but luckily the parents noticed me and held their children back before crossing. What I didn't know was that they also had a little girl with them, and from my angle, she was hidden behind the wall of this family bunched together. As I passed this family, I noticed the little girl, but because of how fast I was going (which wasn't even that fast as mentioned before), there was no stopping this incident. She ran head first into the side of my front wheel, and quite fast at that. Quick sidebar: my bicycle is very old, it is my grandmother's bicycle from the 60's, which means that there weren't handbrakes, but pedal brakes, so in order to brake/slow down, I would need to pedal backwards. Back to the story, the second she hit the bicycle, I pedalled backwards with so much strength in order to bring my bicycle to a complete stop, but because of how old the bicycle is, it didn't stop immediately, it skidded a good meter or two before it did, dragging the little girl with me.\n\nImmediately after the incident, I stepped off and put the bicycle aside so fast. I felt so terrible about the incident and went to check on the family. They weren't very happy with me to say the least, which was understandable, the mother was yelling at me saying I was trying to kill her daughter and that I need to go to jail for attempted murder. As a local, the anger from them was entirely justified, but to me, they were in the wrong for not stopping their daughter from running across the bicycle lane, which they were aware was there. I even told them after with sincerity that they need to be more aware of their little ones in this city because this happens a lot more often than one may think.\n\nAnyways, Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692195848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15src8h/aita_because_a_little_girl_ran_head_first_into/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In the U.S., anyone in/on a vehicle who hits a pedestrian is *always* considered at fault, even if they were obeying traffic laws and the pedestrian was not -- and Americans will sue the driver to get money even when it's 100% their/their kid's fault.\n\nI say this as an American: a lot of Americans are not big on personal responsibility, and will always find someone else to blame for things that are their own fault. You are NTA here. Please stop thinking about this woman's words; she was a negligent parent and is blaming you for her own negligence."]}
