Yeah, that makes sense. LOL\n\nBTW, you're little ones are going to pick up their bad habits/choices. I hope you take the little ones away from the trough while the rest eat their slop.", "NTA It\u2019s rude to eat with your mouth open. If they can eat properly while in company, they can do that for you. I\u2019m with you, I find it revolting.", "Kinda sounds like you have Misophonia (People with misophonia are affected emotionally by common sounds \u2014 usually those made by others, and usually ones that other people don't pay attention to. The examples above (breathing, yawning, or chewing) create a fight-or-flight response that triggers anger and a desire to escape)", "your kids are going to pick this up. and with the way she responded when asked to eat like a human instead of whatever she\u2019s emulating rn does not bode well for how she\u2019ll react in a situation where the stakes are bigger. nta, this is gross gross gross. start having your kids eat with you instead of with her.", "NTA\n\nJust like speaking with your mouth full, eating with an open mouth is disgusting.\n\nThere is no way she cannot eat with her mouth closed so is just putting on an act.  She hid it from you because she knows its horrible.\n\nIf you are having big arguments about it I would be voting with my feet as you are with someone who doesn't have basic manners, knows it to the point of hiding it but doesn't think enough of you to be willing to change.", "NTA\n\nshe needs to be able to eat like a civilized person, and her kids needs to learn that too or they will have a rough time out there in the world.", "NTA, but having separate meal times is not a viable nor permanent solution. They can manage to eat like a civilised person with company, so they can manage at home. Sure, table manners are going to be more relaxed while you lounge on your couch with a bag of chips than in a Michelin star restaurant, but come on. Chewing with your mouth open is horrible. No one needs to see that, and they seem to manage just fine in public. If they don't see you as worthy of basic manners, escalate.", "Uh, she\u02bcs fucking gross and setting a bad example. Tell her this.", "NTA  \n\n\nWhat else are you going to do, have every meal while seething in infrustration and anger?", "The screaming in anger part is a little concerning. Do you have misophonia?", "NTA but I'm sorry to say that your solution isn't a permanent one and there will be a time when you might need to bring your spouse to a work event or there's a double date night or a family night out. \n\nShe has no desire to change how she eats. She has no desire for you to educate or help change her kids' eating habits. \n\nSo ultimately you need to decide if this is a dealbreaker for you. I work with the public and go to a lot of events. I would not be caught dead with a partner who eats that way. I might hide her away if it's that bad.", "NTA. Coordinating meals for everyone and yourself isn't easy. I cook for myself and my elderly mother, and she never wants what I'm cooking, never wants a normal portion, and never really wants it when I'm actually hungry. Coordinating for anyone else is never easy or simple. \n\nI like to eat at six usually, she wants hers at four or seven, I make meatloaf and she then wants chicken, or I make cheeseburgers and instead she wants chicken. It's ridiculous and causes me constant anxiety. And the older she gets the more toddler like she's getting with her demands. I'm at the point where I'll sneak out for my dinner at three and make what she wants for herself at five.", "NTA", "It is rlly annoying when ppl chew w their mouth open but maybe you guys should sit down and teach them how to eat properly", "NTA, but this needs to be addressed", "NTA, you don't mean harm or try to humiliate her, you tell her the truths. She needs to get her table manners in check. If not - they should eat separately.", "YTA. How about a family discussion time? I get it, the open mouth thing is disgusting and rude... and yet you are ok with being rude if it suits you better.

Did you apply a rule you discipline your own kids and speak to your partner if a need may arise? (Question directly relates to why you've approached her about the way she eats, but seemingly not tried asking her kids to close their mouths whilst chewing.)\n\nDo your 3 and 5 year olds regularly eat with them, and witness this behaviour, or do they have an earlier dinner time which means they aren't exposed to this behaviour. If they have a different dinner time, do you schedule to eat at the same time as the little ones or have 3 separate meal times in the house?\n\nWhen you say they eat very loudly, are you referring only to the noise resulting from open mouthed chewing, or are you referring to something more? Like lots of talking, sometimes with a mouthful or food, or deliberate emphasis being put on their enjoyment etc?\n\nFrom your post, it is clear they have one eating habit for others, another when it is just you and them. That begs a couple of obvious questions/possibilities. Are they behaving this way because they used to do so when it was just the three of them, and they consider it is acceptable around you because you are now part of their family unit? Or are they deliberately behaving this way because they knew it is rude, and irritates/upsets you, and they either don't want you there (leading back to my first question) or consider it humorous to wind you up this way?", "NTA. For some reason people seem to think meal times are the hill to die on for family time. Although it is a nice time to catch up and talk with minimal distractions, there are many other activities that this can be accomplished. \n\nI often eat separately from my family just because I have a much different diet and it\u2019s easier to cook and eat on my own terms when my body tells me I\u2019m hungry. \n\nHer children will figure it out when they start dating or friends call them out on their gross habits. You do you and continue with table manners with your children!", "It could just be that people eating with their mouths open is disgusting and poor table manners is what's causing them to rage. Who wants to see someone else's half-chewed food still in their mouths?", "Family discussion time? He literally said he tried to talk to her about it, but she turns it into a fight. He's tired of fighting so he just doesn't eat with them. Maybe read the post before commenting?", "I have discussed polietly and it lead to an extensive agrument about its how she eats", "Not wanting to see it is absolutely reasonable. RAGE isn't.", "I read the post and understand it completely. Hes going to have to continue acting like an adult instead of a huffy teen.", "Then you do it again, and again. And you mention it to the kids since you are a parental figure in the house. Time to be a grown up.", "How is leaving the table instead of fighting with her acting like a huffy teen? This should be good.", "Because the hypocrite is complaining about their manners so he thinks its ok to be rude himself. He could easily act like a parental figure to the kids and teach them about proper manners, but failed at that as well. Honestly what are you missing?", "Rude to leave the table when others are being rude? Are you for real? And your suggestion is to discuss it again, and you state it as if he hasn't already done that ad nauseum. What I'm missing is how it's somehow rude to leave a rude situation. He taught his kids to have manners. Now he has to try and teach her nearly adult children to have manners when they three of them refuse? It's amazing how you think he is somehow at fault here. I suppose if someone in your family took a dump on the dinner table, your response would be to stay at the table and continue eating, right? Because if you got up and left due to your family member's rude behavior, that would make you rude, right? LMAO", "Talk about a knee jerk response and exaggeration. Hes an adult, time to act like it. You could use the same advice as well."]}
