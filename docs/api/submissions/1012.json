He could be finding small ways to make your day better too. He could be showing how appreciative he is that you've gone above and beyond. He could be communicating with you to negotiate what a fair and realistic division of housework/childcare would look like right now. He should be doing his utmost to recover, not adding additional injuries through hockey.", "NTA He's right that movement can help in many cases, but not hockey ffs!

You are the both of you going through it right now. \n\nEverything changed, and you two are understandably running into some challenges. Your husband being injured doesn't help, but the more central challenge here is that you two have an entirely new relationship now. Everything is about the baby. That's how it's supposed to be, but you guys need to find time to be there for one another too. \n\nEasier said than done, I know... but right now you're both looking at one another like \"hey, where are you right now?\" not yet able to realize that you're in the same boat. \n\nTalk. Come together as a team. Find a way to keep that guy off the couch! Pain can make people really short-tempered. No fuse left when you're on fire.  \n\nAnd post-partum depression can hit both men and women alike. Don't let mental health stuff go unaddressed because you're both busy with the baby. Healthy parents are better parents. You were right to suggest therapy, but the way you did it probably wasn't the greatest. Understandable, but it wasn't \"get therapy because I care about you\" it was \"get therapy because I'm done with your shit\". \n\nAnd he needs to take better care of himself so he can better support you! Pregnancy and giving birth is *crazy* hard and so much work. You need breaks and help.\n\nUltimately I don't see any bad guys. You two just need to find a new healthy balance in your new life.", "LOL don't give up on your vows just yet, honey -- sleep deprivation can make anyone drown in despair. *It won't always be like this.* Congrats on your new baby, and I'm sorry you've also got a grouchy, injured spouse on your hands. \n\nYou have a valid point -- he's dragging you down and you're extra-exhausted. This has to be stopped, with whatever pain relief and emotional management he can get on board. He needs to BE THERE for you and the nipper, not checked out and nonresponsive (and not working!!)  \n\nCounselling can't hurt and might help. But ultimately your man's pain is his to manage -- you can't do it for him. \n\nHe is probably dismayed that his body is letting him down, or at least hinting that it's time to switch modes from \"weekend warrior jock\" to \"proud and present father\". It may take some time for him to get his head around that, and find new ways to move that don't aggravate his back. Motivate him to keep working on the problem, but please don't give up the ship just yet.  \n\nFor now...what if you found a local babysitter and had a regular weekly date when you could have a couple hours to yourself -- either with or without him? Even to slink off and take a guilt-free nap? Would life maybe look a little brighter to you? \n\nNTA for recognizing when you've hit your limit, OP. Here's hoping you both find some workable safety valves before it all blows up!", "Nta. Your not there as a personal punching bag. Especially as its really self inflicted.  He had disc issues then goes and plays hockey making it worse. He's going to get in serious trouble one day and just not be able to bounce back at all from it. \n\nI get hockey is an iutlet but he either needs to be more careful or go watch the game", "NTA. You too need to have a come to Jesus talk and lay everything out. I horrible pain can make good people be awful but they have no right to make everyone else miserable. He needs a good pain doctor and game plan which includes you not being his punching bag. Why in the hell was he playing hockey with a bad disc?  Couples counseling needs to happen ASAP", "NTA. Debilitating chronic pain can really suck, but you cannot take it out on your partner. And he might be right that physical movement is important, as it is for many bodily aches, but hockey is not it. Hockey is a contact sport and is just going to make it worse. He really needs to find a better physical outlet and learn to appreciate what you're doing.", "ESH. A herniated disc is extremely painful, some people deal with pain by essentially shutting down. But on the other side he should be making efforts to reach out for some mental health support if its affecting him so much", "NTA. \nHockey and PT are the last things he should be doing for his back at the moment.  It needs rest and recovery. And he should go see a physiotherapist to see exactly what he should and shouldn't be doing in terms of movement to aid recovery. \nHe is going to end up blowing out his back completely continuing what he is doing.", "NTA. You don\u2019t go play hockey with a herniated disk. What was he thinking? Movement is good, but hockey isn\u2019t just movement. It's a lot of impact. \n\nHe absolutely does need to get his shit together. You're still going to be recovering from pregnancy and delivery for another 8 months or so, and you\u2019re basically single parenting an infant, the dog, the household, and a grown man. And he's not even showing gratitude for what you're doing. \n\nYou are not the one being selfish in this situation. Being in pain isn\u2019t an excuse for unkindness or any other kind of bad behaviour. A few years back, my partner had to bathe me for four months, and I kept my sense of humour and gratitude throughout because I appreciated everything he was doing for me in spite of my pain. He needs to do better. \n\nBeing married doesn\u2019t mean you have to share the same space. If you need a break, please take it. Bundle up that baby and pup, and spend as much time away as you need to, to reboot, and maybe give him time to appreciate you.", "He keeps saying that movement is the only thing that will help him heal and hockey is one of his only \u2018escapes\u2019.", "Wow. Thank you so much! I feel like I needed to hear this.", "He is doing what he can with doctors and physical therapists, but he can\u2019t go on heavy duty pain medication with his line of work. \nHockey is one of his only outlets and he keeps saying that movement will help fix his problem. But it seems like whenever he plays, he comes home with a new injury. His body used to be really resilient, and now it just isn\u2019t", "And do you get an escape or is it just him?", "Holy hell, he\u2019s STILL continuing to play?  You can\u2019t keep doing that with a herniated disk.  And he probably needs to try to get into a new line of work, because manual labor jobs are a common cause of herniated discs.  Hockey is NOT the right kind of movement to help him heal.  It\u2019s  like lighting himself on fire to stay warm because fire is warm.  A campfire (gentle exercise) would keep him warm, lighting himself on fire (continuing to play hockey) just creates new problems.\n\nI know from experience that being forced to give up physical hobbies you love due to injury or disability is a terribly bitter pill to swallow.  I suddenly lost all of mine when I was 24.  But continuing to break down his body is making him behave as a lousy partner.", "He was a lot better at making sure I had breaks up to a month ago. I don\u2019t feel like he even sees that I have needs too anymore."]}
