Our friend Curtis just recently went through a divorce, so we all thought it would be nice to take him out to take his mind off things. My friend group is fairly big once we all get together, it's just hard with people starting families, moving, etc etc. Among the group was my little brother Don, Don hasn't been around as much since getting married, but I could tell he needed this night just as bad as Curtis. \n\nWe all met up at our friends apartment in Wicker Park. We were all having a good time catching up and pregaming before heading out to the bars for the night. It was nice seeing everyone in the same place again and as a result things got rowdy fairly quickly. After hitting a few bars our group began to dwindle in numbers. There were only 5 of us left and in an attempt to rally to continue on we decided to stop at McDonalds to soak up the alcohol. We were all shitfaced by the time we sat down with our food. As we went to leave Don went to the bathroom and told us he'd be right out. We all sat in the parking lot waiting but we got restless after awhile, thinking if we didn't leave soon we'd all pack it in the for the night so we decided to leave and text him where we would be going. Knowing it wasn't too far from where we were. \n\nWhen we got the final bar this girl I matched with on Hinge hit me up asking what I was doing. Being drunk and admittedly a tad horny, I decided to pursue. I ended up leaving to meet her back at my place and woke up the next morning to a barrage of texts from my brothers wife. Turns out my brother had passed out in the bathroom stall and woke up hours later around 4-5 am to find himself locked in McDonald's. They had to come and let him out and he had to explain the situation. Needless to say, he, his wife and my parents weren't thrilled about it. \n\nThe way I see it, he's a grown man and should have communicated how drunk he was or went home instead of pushing it. I didn't know he would end up passed out in the stall.

How much effort would it have been to go and check on him? You're a shitty brother and a shitty friend.", "Ok, let me get this straight, you and a bunch of friends went out and got toasted. After going to multiple bars, you went to McDonalds for food. On the way out your brother told you he was going to the restroom. When he didn\u2019t come out, you and your friends decided to leave him there and go to another bar where you hooked up with a strange woman and took her home.\nYTA because 1. you were drinking and driving 2. Because you never went in to check on your brother who could have fallen or gotten sick. YTA YTA YTA and so immature. Grow up.", "YTA - Thought you were brothers. When partying and it ramps up do not leave people alone; it is unsafe. I lost a cousin when 'friends' dumped him at home in the front flower garden. He vomited and died (aspiration pneumonia). You couldn't bang on the bathroom door? He'd respond or you'd get staff to unlock and enter. Your decisions were self centered.", "ESH, if he was \"taking so long\" why did no one go check on him? This was beyond dangerous, he could have choked on his own vomit... \nHe sucks, because drinking to that excess is just beyond stupid \nYou suck for abandoning a member of your party. \nThe whole group sucks for being that obnoxiously drunk in public\nMcDonald's sucks for not checking the bathrooms before locking up.", "YTA! First and foremost, if you were buzzed enough to think this was totally ok, you most definitely should not have been driving! Second of all, when you go out with friends, there is an expectation that you have each others back. Leaving and not even checking on your brother so you can get laid puts you at the top of your AH class!", "YTA.  Drinking and driving, for starters.  What if your brother had a medical emergency in the restroom and died?  YTA, holy crap, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.", "YTA\nWho leaves a drunk person behind?", "YTA. Why not go and check on him before bailing?", "YTA. You went out as part of a community, and everyone has to watch out for each other and make sure everyone in the community is safe. You really screwed up. You failed your brother and you owe him an apology.", "YTA. Never abandon a drunk friend.", "YT.A", "I would say your the AH if he was taking to long in the bathroom you should have gone to check on him. The only phrase never leave a man behind is completely relevant here. Yes he is a grown man but everyone has their moments.", "Um YTA you guys didn't even bother to check on him, what if something happened? You yourself said you're all drunk as shit, your brother could have gotten hurt, wandered off somewhere, or anything but you guys just left him without a care.", "YTA was it really so hard just to send someone inside to check on him.", "YTA for getting restless and leaving him there. Why wouldn't one of you run inside to check on him? Obviously if he had been in there for a while, something wasn't right. Especially if he didn't text back.", "YTA\n\nThe lack of concern for your brother is horrifying, did you even notice him not coming to the next bar? Weren't you wondering what was taking so long?", "YTA, easy one. The fact you don\u2019t give a damn about your own brother is disgusting", "YTA cause you didn't check on him before moving on.", "YTA for not checking that nothing was wrong smh", "YTA. You should have checked why he was taking so long, instead of leaving him there", "YTA, because he was too drunk to communicate with anyone. How did you know that nobody went into the bathroom and robbed him, or worse? Selfish. I am not loving how you take zero responsibility either. I'm pretty sure if the situation were reversed and your brother chose getting screwed over your safety, you'd be pissed too.", "YTA. Going out with a group means making sure everyone in said group is accounted for at the end of the night.", "Dude, you KNOW you\u2019re the asshole for doing this, you and all your friends.  Being shitfaced is no excuse for bailing on your brother in a situation like that.  Anyone with two brain cells left to rub together can figure that out.", "YTA\nThe absolute least you could have done was walk in and check on him since he was taking so long and then call him an Uber to take him home then continue on with your night. I would hope as a friend someone would care enough to check on their friend but that\u2019s your brother and no f\u2019s given on your part. That\u2019s unfortunate", "YTA\n\nYou didn't bother to check on your friend because you were horny? I get it yall were drunk but seriously? Not one person in your whole friend group was sensible enough to check on their friend?", "Omg. Did the brother write this? YtA.", "Wicker Park? Don't tell me y'all are representing the Chi with this foolishness. \n\nYTA", "YTA.  Never leave a drunk friend (or relative) behind.  The fact he hadn\u2019t come out of the bathroom should have suggested something was wrong.  I know you were inebriated yourselves but still.", "Y T A \n\nYES, YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE !!! First off in that state no one can really communicate that they should call it or need to go home. Second please Clarify that no one that was drunk was driving....if so not only are you the ass hole but a dumbass", "YTA. i'm usually more a fan of letting people fend for themselves, but if a group of your party literally disappears, at least do your due diligence and check on them before continuing on with your night. \n\nbeing shitfaced enough to disappear in a mcdonalds shitter isn't that far away from drunkenly falling his way into a tbi. or passing out on his back and choking to death on his own puke. \n\nlike, it was your little brother, my guy. it wasn't some annoying lamprey that attached themselves to your party; it was family. not like you had to babysit him for the rest of the night, but is the familial fallout worth the time it would've taken to check on him and summon an uber? i doubt it.", "YTA. as mentioned by others, He could have been seriously hurt. You are a shitty brother", "YTA for leaving a shitfaced friend in some unknown state because \"you were horny.\" If you drove while shitfaced drunk that'd make you double the asshole so I certainly hope that didn't happen too.", "You all sound like a bunch of charmers. What sophisticated company! Can I come to your next meeting of the minds?", "Yta for leaving your drunk brother to fend for himself", "Buddy system isn't just for children, my dude. YTA", "YTA.  One of the reasons people go out in groups to drink is so that they have friends to look after them.  You absolutely should have checked on him before you left - I can't believe that wasn't your first instinct!", "YTA for ditching anyone, much less your brother. Especially for a drunken hookup.", "Look out for your little brother my guy \u2014 even if you guys are adults now. YTA", "YTA leave no man behind.", "Esh. \n\nEveryone was drunk making bad decisions. Everyone made bad decisions to get so drunk you couldn\u2019t even make 1 good decision amongst all of you.", "ESH Your brother should know his limit, but you and your other friends shouldn\u2019t have ditched him. He told you he\u2019d be out quickly, and instead of waiting you left him behind. Also you have no room to put the onus on him to tell you how drunk he was if you were too drunk to notice.", "ESH \n\nIf there's a next time, your group needs a designated driver who doesn't drink alcohol and makes sure everyone gets home safely \n\nThe restaurant should have checked the bathrooms before leaving (but he couldn't be locked in... the doors unlock from the inside or go out the emergency exit)", "ESH you should have waited and gone to check on him. Or at the very least called him and then if you couldn\u2019t reach him gone to check. \n\nBut he drank all that alcohol aaaaal by himself, he\u2019s responsible for his own drinking and it\u2019s consequences.", "JFC, there's a lot of fucking people here who have never had a drunk night out. I mean sure, ESH, but you've already given us enough information that we know that nobody involved was making good decisions. A bunch of piss drunk idiots are going to leave people behind in their rampage to get even more piss drunk. It's not a good thing, but it's a sure thing. Your increasingly pickled wits can't continue to account for everyone who should be present.", "If he had been in there awhile, you'd be an AH if you didn't check.\n\nIf there were other friends around, and you dipped to pursue a date, NTA", "NTA- if anything its on the employees to check the bathroom before locking up for the night.  Maybe your bro might learn to not drink past his limit.", "OMG! Not sure I can pass judgement on a drunken tale everyone will be sharing for years. The initial sting/anger from SIL will wear off, but she probably will balk at him going out with you for a while \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33", "NTA for THAT. He is a grown family man, and he has a massive alcohol problem. That is not YOUR fault. HE is a MASSIVE AH to his family, but you are not his caretaker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I ended up leaving to meet her back at my place and woke up the next morning to a barrage of texts from my brothers wife.\" . Tell her to discuss it with your brother, it simply is NOT YOUR responsibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you are an alcoholic, ust like him. That is YOUR problem.", "NTA. He's a grownup. No one strongarmed him into drinking, or drinking too much. And how reasonable is it to expect drunk people to be in charge of other drunk people? He didn't come to any actual harm, just very embarrassed. \n\nI actually found the story quite funny.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If people are tired and done partying, let the party end. \n\nI wouldn't leave my brother in a bathroom totally sober much less if we'd been drinking. If walking back in to check on him would've meant an end to the evening, then it should end.

Yta", "Having little true experience with drinking, if you\u2019re already drunk, how would you know you\u2019re at a point where you should tell someone how drunk you are?\n\nYTA for getting defensive and blaming your intoxicated brother.", "YTA.\n\n\nThat's your brother, man. I belong to a particularly large family and we'd have cousin nights out back in the day where we'd get shitfaced. Noone got left behind. Noone.", "ESH", "YTA, you left your brother alone in Chicago while under the influence..... Be happy he is ok", "ESH\n\nYou're right but christ with family like you, I think I'd only drink with strangers. Less chance of being abandoned and I've had strangers be very considerate. Increased odds in making it home at night if he isn't with you lol.", "This story is very likely fabricated. Having worked at McDonalds when I was in college, having been promoted to supervisor, and now having a son who also works at McDonalds while HE is in college, I can tell you that there is no way a McDonalds would ever close without someone first checking and cleaning the bathrooms. It's standard procedure, it's in the rule books, employees would get in trouble for skipping that step, and health code violations would result if surprise inspections occurred. McDonalds bathrooms are cleaned multiple times throughout each day because they get gross--and at night, they're extra gross since drunk people (like the OP's party) show up with the munchies. If workers failed to clean the bathroom before closing, the morning staff would report it out of anger, and the night staff would be in trouble. It's also a matter of security, as thieves could be waiting in the bathroom to rob the place, or someone in need to medical help could be in there. Thus, no McDonalds would ever close without making sure there weren't people in the bathroom. What the OP is describing simply would not happen.", "EHS. Because dude, if you're in a group you stay in a group, you don't just abandon someone or leave without letting the rest know. So if one of the group goes missing, y'all should've been more aware  of it. Why did nobody go check on him. Like I get it, you were hammered, but if your brother didn't walk in half an hour later you should've been worried.  But drunk people do stupid drunk things and if your brother was drunk enough to pass out in a McD's bathroom, that's on him.", "Yta. You really had to ask?", "I think it\u2019s safe to assume some dwi was going on here as well", "Is it weird that McDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t check / clean their potty rooms before locking up for the night\u2026?", "In my defense...she was a solid 7", "This. I\u2019m so sorry about your cousin. OP YTA for prioritizing a hookup over your family.", "This. As adults isn\u2019t the responsible thing to have one sober person around so they can ensure shit like this doesn\u2019t happen? Like a designated driver?

OP is definitely TA for that alone. \n\nSadly, at least the brother was somewhat safely asleep in a bathroom stall. This whole thing is a shitshow.", "Whoa, how do you come about your keyboard diagnosis of alcoholism? They were ALL fucked up.", "Very weird! I've worked at several different location and a total of three different chains, and it is required to check before the crew heads out - and literally every single place I worked, we checked as soon as we closed, so if there *was* someone passed out (or just refusing to leave), the manager would have time to do the paperwork while the rest of us cleaned.", "Well there was a similar situation in On Patrol Live the other weekend, some dude ended up locked in a CVS.", "Plenty of McDonalds are 24 hours. Still weird, but possible explanation as to why no one checked.", "I used to work as a security guard in college at our campus hotel/student center/event space and would check each stall in each bathroom nightly for this very reason.

I worked at KFC and we definitely had to clean the bathrooms before calling it a night. A drunken dude locked into a bathroom stall would've been noted immediately!", "Exactly.
