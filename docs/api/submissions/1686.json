My older brother Cole (26m), me (24f) and my younger brother Dustin (20m). When Dustin was 2 he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. The next several years Cole and I had no parents and no stability because our parents were always taking Dustin to different hospitals, for different trials and leaving the state, sometimes even the country, to work on curing Dustin's cancer. We felt abandoned and became resentful of the lack of attention. Our parents considered us selfish. They said Dustin's recovery was the most important thing and that we should be ashamed for making them feel bad for doing all they could.\n\nIn time Dustin resented Cole and me for not being siblings like he wanted. He didn't like that we weren't around more, didn't hang out as much with him as each other, and that he was left out of stuff. He could never accept that it was our parents fault, not ours. He told me a few days before I moved out of my parents that he hated us and wished he was an only child.\n\nCole and I did not speak to our parents after we moved out and Dustin told us to fuck off and not to talk to him again.\n\nSo a lot of estrangement happened. Cole and I had an us against the world thing where we considered each other the only family we had.\n\nIt seems sometime after we left, Dustin was given good news regarding his health and our parents were overjoyed. But Dustin ended up not having the best relationship with them. Though he still resents Cole and me (found out through someone who knows him).\n\nIn the last couple of months my parents have made contact with me and Cole, have tried to reconcile, but we have said no. When they refused to take no for an answer (changed their number a few different times to get around being blocked), I answered the phone and told them to focus on their kid who matters and to leave us alone, because they can't start being our parents again after almost 2 decades. My parents said Cole and I had never understood their position and made them feel like shit when they were going through the worst pain a parent can experience and why were we so cruel. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667815079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoi8as/aita_for_telling_my_parents_to_focus_on_their_kid/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I am writing any of this, the reason I feel like I could be the asshole, the reason this bothers me, is because I know my younger brother's cancer was life threatening. I know he could have died. I know my parents were acting with very little true family support and that my brother and I were healthy so it as easy for us to get less attention. I know they are trying to make up for that now and I'm so angry with them and so disinterested that I made a jab that would send a message.

I hope this all gets worked out but we probably can't help you here.", "NTA. You were neglected as children 'cause you were not sick. No matter the reason for that neglect, it happened. You cannot be blamed for how you feel. It is your reality. Your parents may not have had much choice in their actions but their words to you both were very calloused. They really seemed to care about the one and not the rest. They should have attempted to step up for you but that never happened. And they never apologized. Your parents failed you for not apologizing and recognizing their part in the failure. There was nothing you could have done then to change things. All the chances have been lost to time.", "So, to be clear, your parents are seeking a relationship with you, but NOT apologizing for what they (inadvertently) put you through? \n\nIt sounds as if they're still trying to make you feel bad: \"My parents said Cole and I had never understood their position and made them feel like shit when they were going through the worst pain a parent can experience.\" \n\nMost children do NOT understand being abandoned, even if the parents have good reasons for doing it, and to expect small, immature children to grasp the reason for their suffering really is asking too much. You're now adults and have the absolute right to set your own boundaries. If your parents really do want to try to heal the rift, their attempt to reconcile should include a sincere apology.", "NTA. If your parents took some responsibility, sure, it could be something else. But you and Cole have never been allowed to do anything else than understanding and accepting their position, it's they who refuse to understand yours.\n\nI think they might be keeping themselves from understanding. It would be really hard to have to realise how much harm they've caused. It's easier for them to think that they were just martyrs doing the best they could out of a shitty situation.\n\nBut if you have more than one kid, you still have more than one kid even if one of them is really sick. And you have to make sure that *all* the kids feel like they're important. Sure, you won't have as much time for them as for the other kid, and not as much time as if there wasn't a sick kid at all, but you still have to make the time you have *matter*.\n\nYour parents have been incredibly selfish, and hid that behind a mask of selflessness. They've thrown you under the bus, and you are justified in cutting contact and in saying what you said. They clearly wouldn't listen to anything else.", "NTA. Just because one child has medical needs doesn't mean that they matter more than any other children in the family. Yes Dustin needed special care at times but that didn't mean he was the only one that mattered. If neither he nor your parents can see that, then they can go pound sand.", "NTA. You are an adult now and you are responsible for your choices, just as they were. I know they were in a difficult situation but your childhood has gone and that's clearly had a huge effect on you.", "NTA. You were children, wanting your parents around and not understanding what was going on is things children do. This is not your fault and it's not Cole's fault. Go give Cole a hug whwne you see him next. \n\nYour parents need to understand you were children too and even though their first priority became an unhealthy child and they did what they could as parents to help the one that was ill, they still neglected you and their actions, even though they were only for the sake of health, pushed you away. \n\nAll your parents can do is apologise and even if you don't want them too, send you messages or call with love in mind, not their own sadness\n\n\"My parents said Cole and I had never understood their position and made them feel like shit when they were going through the worst pain a parent can experience and why were we so cruel.\" <--- Since Dustin was 2, putting you at 4 and 6.

Not the same situation obviously but I had a father who cheated on my mom and dipped to a different state to be with his new family. The feeling they don't care as much about you and such I get it.   \n\n\nHave you sat down and like in as much of a neutral state as you can looked back to see if their actions were actually dismissive of you two, or if they are just flawed people who were overwhelmed with 3 children one with a life threatening disease and just doing the best they could?  \n\n\nidk AH?

She bumped her shoulder and ended up with an entrapped nerve due to a genetic disease (connective tissue is super weak so her body couldn\u2019t keep things together the way it should). However she wasn\u2019t officially diagnosed yet so our local children\u2019s hospital disregarded the diagnosis and put her on meds that shouldn\u2019t be given with her genetic disease and then mixed meds that have a black box warning label. It caused her health to spiral out of control. For a month we were in and out of the hospital every 3 days. Admit for 3 days and discharge...re-admit 12-24 hrs later. If we were lucky once or twice she got two days at home. It was bad. She lost the ability to walk and was put in a wheelchair. She lost the ability to talk. She started having seizures. It was bad. I didn\u2019t see my little (then 3 yo) for a month bc the vid, hospital protocols and well...it wasn\u2019t safe for her sister to be there. I will admit there were sometimes 3-4 days before I would remember to check on my little (she was staying with my parents) bc I was so consumed with keeping my child alive. My little was healthy. I knew she was safe. I have one job...to keep my children safe. I couldn\u2019t fail at that job. I\u2019m happy to say we have recovered to a functioning level. We are still trying to see the extent of the damage done by the hospital to see if we need to Sue. But she is live. Also my little was 3 so she thought she got to play at grandma\u2019s house and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I\u2019m labeling NTA bc there should have been help. You guys should have been in therapy to cope. And I have a funny feeling your parents over compensated for your bro due to the situation which further alienated you and your older bro. Unfortunately they neglected your needs to a detriment. That\u2019s on them. They can ask for forgiveness. They can try to make amends but they don\u2019t get to harass you. Also a favorite quote of mine comes to mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to judge me for how I fix what you broke.\u201d They broke things. They don\u2019t get to judge how you put it all back together.", "Nta", "No one here is really the asshole. You deserved parents but...your brother was sick. And maybe dying.

Having so little time with your parents must have sucked, and been really hard to understand as a child. I really feel for you all. \n\nThe reason I would say soft YTA, is what exactly do you think your parents could have realistically done differently? Of course they are going to take their child to every possible treatment/ trial to keep him alive and well. It\u2019s not like they wanted to play favourites or that their plan for having a family was to exclude you both, but circumstances meant they literally had no choice other than to spend more time with your brother. If it had been the you who\u2019d been diagnosed, they would have done the exact same for you.\n\nI think your parents are reaching out now because even though you are understandably hurt about the lack of attention you received, you are now an adult and hopefully can now see your parent\u2019s point of view more/ realise that they were in an impossible situation.", "NAH\n\nYour parents and Dustin must have been through hell and I wouldn't  wish this situation on anyone.\nOn the other hand being/feeling abandoned as a kid is horrible. \nHowever much you are entitled to feeling the way you do, I also don't know if your parents really could've done much differently. \n\nCancer sucks and I feel sorry for what it did to your family.", "Are you sure they spent all that time on Dustin, that it wasn't just en excuse you couldn't argue with, because after all he was ill?\n\nWhen I grew up I lived with the impression that my parents never had time for me and my sisters because they used it for my brother, who was the 'problematic child'. Later I remember one of my sisters having a fight with them screaming that they cared more about me, because I was 'starting to be problematic'. And I realised that this wasn't true, they didn't care or spend time or energy on me, I thought they where caring for them. Much later a picture began to emerge: They didn't really care about any of us. They would just use one of us s an apology to the others why they didn't engage. My dad was basically always either working or having headaches. And my mother was a very traumatized narcissist, with no real space for anyone.\n\nI'm not saying that this is the same in your case, but maybe trying to look deeper and see the patterns can help.", "NAH. Your parents were in a difficult situation where their kid had cancer and could have died from it. They must have felt like trying to focus on their sick child as much as they could, or spend as much time as they could. For a parent, the worst thing that could happen is to see their child suffer or/and die.\n\n>My parents said Cole and I had never understood their position and made them feel like shit when they were going through the worst pain a parent can experience and why were we so cruel. \n\nThis paragraph alone explains what I said before.\n\nHowever, your and Cole\u2019s feelings is understandable cause you two wanted some of your parent\u2019s love, especially since the thing started when you and Cole were 6 and 8, the age where you need your parent\u2019s care and attention a lot before transitioning into adolescence and adulthood.\n\nYou also mentioned in one of your comments how your parents never checked on you and Cole whenever you two were alone and spend most of your childhoods with your babysitter who themselves were occasionally present or extended family who never wanted you two. This is negligent on their behalf because again, what children at ages as young as 6 and 8 need is some support from their parents, especially if no external support like a babysitter or external family would even bother providing.", "ESH\n\nTo be completely fair, you and Cole were still VERY young when all of this was happening. From the sounds of it, your parents expected you two to be adults about all of this, when that's WAY too much to expect from a 6 and 8-year-old. It sounds to me like they barely had a grip on how to handle this like adults. Telling your children \"you made me feel like shit\" is a bit manipulative. Kudos to you two for standing up to them.\n\nI don't think your reaction was harsh, but I wouldn't cut off all communication with them unless you're absolutely sure that they won't listen to you or change their ways. Maybe suggest family therapy before they try to contact you two again (I mean, almost losing your kid to cancer is traumatic enough, and they might have some unaddressed stuff there). I don't mean to suggest that you should fix your relationship with them, because if you and Cole are happy without ever talking to them: great, continue on. I would, however, suggest paths that help them understand how you two feel, and tell them that if they want a relationship with you, they have to prove that it's for the right reasons, and that they've made concrete steps to change.", "YTA, I understand where you're coming from, but their child had cancer and they wanted to do all they could to cure them, which worked by the sounds of it. Its rubbish that you didn't have parents there for you because they had to put their focus elsewhere, but they did it for the right reasons and would have done the same for any of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were 8 and Cole was 6 when Dustin's cancer was discovered.

Moreover they probably felt guilty but instead of admitting that and trying to make it up to you they tried to guilt trip you.\n\nYou were left alone and forgotten. Dustin probably never understood what happened. He was taught that he is the one who matters and also that you are not giving him the attention he deserves. What he deserved and needed was an equal relationship with his brothers. This your parents denied from him. \n\nYou can well tell your parents that \"too little, too late\". Perhaps it might be good to give Dustin a bit more time and then give him a chance. Getting down from a pedestal is really difficult but that is what he should do if he wants a relationship with you.", "INFO you were 6 when your brother was diagnosed, he was ill for several year, so you were about 9/10 when he got better? What about all the other years until you were old enough to leave home?", "OP, You guys are not the assholes. You were children and your parents disregarded your mental and emotional well being in favor of your youngest brother. Now that his health is hunky dory, they want to be in your life again. Its obviously a little too late for that. Also consider that it might feel good to make thrm work for your affection. They got 2 decades to make up for.

You were both children and you deserved better", "Grow up", "ESH", "Uff... there's a lot to unpack.\n\nI grew up with a brother who needed more care than me and so I know how it feels to be the neglected sibling. I worked through that in therapy and know it's a very common phenomenon. Your parents most probably don't love you any less than Dustin, they were just gravitating towards the one who needed the most urgent care and not handling that well.\n\nThey should have provided you and Cole more support or at least therapy to accompany Dustin's treatments, but likely didn't have the energy for supporting you more and also didn't have the knowledge to realize how vital professional help would have been for you (let's face it, back then going to a therapist wasn't normal).\n\nAnyways, you and Cole have every right to maintain no or low contact with your parents, but you saying they should \"focus on their kid who matters\" shows that you are still in the middle of an emotional storm. You are not an unreasonable AH, but definitely immature and putting out blame where you need to put in work.\n\nThis is going to be unpopular, but NAH.

There are consequences to actions-and unfortunately the whole family is paying the price. Some wounds are too deep.", "They were six and eight years old when this started. That\u2019s a lifetime of neglect. Developmentally they were unable to understand the situation for what it was outside of their own needs. There were two parents who could have taken turns caring for all of the children.   \nSure, they can understand what their parents fears were during that time as adults.

But the chances are their minds were in turmoil and they knew you were safe. Your parents (like all parents / people) are flawed for sure, but do you really think they were intentionally cruel/ neglectful or just overwhelmed with such a horrific thing as having a child with cancer? Only you know the answer to that. \n\nI just think it would be a huge shame to give up on a possible relationship with them over something they would have done anything themselves to avoid too. I also think the more you grow, and if you choose to have children of your own, you will understand their predicament more and regret not making an effort to reconcile. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean your feelings were invalid in anyway btw- clearly this was detrimental to your childhood and an honest conversation with your parents about your feelings may be the way to go.  \n\nIt\u2019s just a sad situation all round and your parents don\u2019t sound like bad people, just desperate people in an impossible situation.

It\u2019s not bc she was less important or less loved. It\u2019s bc my brain compartmentalized things. Emergent deal with now vs urgent and non urgent. My oldest was emergent. My little was urgent. I knew she was safe so my brain focused on the emergent situation...keeping her sister alive. When I would remember to check in I would feel horrible but I would hide that guilt.
