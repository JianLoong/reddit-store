This is a really complicated situation, so I'm going to try to be as detailed as possible.\n\nMy daughter (16F) goes to a pretty diverse high school. There are a lot of refugees and immigrants in her class, which is great, but it can also lead to some cultural misunderstandings. Recently, my daughter was working on a group project with a refugee boy (15M) who is from a country where it's more common to be forward with women.\n\nAccording to my daughter, the boy said \"hey you're hot\" and leaned in to kiss her. My daughter immediately left, went to her teacher and reported him for sexual harassment. The school took her report seriously and gave the boy a two-week suspension.\n\nBut now, the refugee boy and his friend, who are the only two refugees in her class from his country, are being bullied even worse. They're being called \"creeps\" and \"perverts\" and are getting dirty looks and snickers from everyone.\n\nI tried to talk to my daughter about being kind to the boys and understanding that they come from a different culture, but she was not interested in hearing it. She's convinced that she did the right thing by reporting the boy and that he should have known better than to say something like that to her.\n\nThat's when I decided to ground her. I told her that it was cruel to report the boy and cause him to get suspended and that she needed to be more empathetic to his situation. I also told her that she needed to be kind to the refugee boys and help them feel more welcome in their new school and in our country.\n\nBut now I'm wondering if I made a mistake.

I think you were wrong to ground her.   \n\n\nIn my limited experience of refugees, some have come from situations where severely fucked up stuff was going on around them, i.e. in camps, and they have learned some problematic stuff. But I do not know of any culture where it is normal to be very forward with women. Unless he's a refugee from a western nation. Quite the contrary - the problems arise because men/boys from cultures where male/female relationships are strictly monitored think that our more free and easy behaviour +  porn means that they can do this stuff. However they know perfectly well that it is not appropriate in THEIR culture.

If you're an American you wouldn't tolerate this from an American especially considering America notoriously doesn't take sexual assault seriously.", "He\u2019s also not a baby or an animal. And unless he\u2019s severely cognitively impaired, he is more than smart enough to observe the behavior of other people around him and realize that people in his new home do not behave that way. \n\nHis actions were 100% unacceptable. Please don\u2019t let your savior complex and pity (and that is what you feel - you pity him, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t make all these lame excuses for his wildly inappropriate behavior) override your daughter\u2019s safety. SHE is your priority. SHE is who you should be protecting, not some strange boy you feel sorry for. \n\nIf a boy (from ANY culture, country, creed, class, or circumstance) had done this to my 16 year old baby sister, I\u2019d be proud of her for reporting it. Hell, I\u2019d only be disappointed that she didn\u2019t manage to get in a good slap or a kick to the nads to remind the little creep what\u2019s what. I sure as shit wouldn\u2019t stand for anyone trying to *punish* her for it - she was the VICTIM here! \n\nShame on you. You\u2019re so desperate to seem accepting of others that you\u2019re condescending to this boy and basically implying he\u2019s an ignorant child and should therefore get away with attempted sexual assault, and you\u2019re completely invalidating your daughter\u2019s discomfort at *almost being sexually assaulted.* \n\nDo better, because your daughter (and every woman on earth who has had their harassment by gross, awful men rug-swept and ignored by jerks like you) deserves better than this.", "Oh no, he\u2019s had a hard life, let\u2019s just let him force himself on girls /s", "What does any of that have to do with his actions? People can come from an amazing and wealthy background, and still be stupid like this. YTA", "Add in a YTA from me for good ole' fashion patronizing racism.", "Probably.  That's pretty much what I was thinking to say but was afraid I'd get banned.", "Obviously not, but that said having a healthy sex life is important and many refugees are rejected by white privileged western women because of racism", "yep, pretty sure he got out after 3 months or less.", "Race makes no difference, harassment is harassment", "Doesnt matter. He sexually harassed your daughter and tried to assault her. Why the heck do you care more about this boy then you do your own kid?", "And? Doesn\u2019t change that his actions were very wrong.", "Creeps come in every shade.", "literally doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from or what you look like, sexual harassment is sexual harassment. this isn\u2019t complicated. HUGE YTA btw, i\u2019m from a \u201cculture where being forward with women is more common\u201d and my dad would still kick someone\u2019s ass if they tried something. be better.", "No one cares harassment is harassment you sound like a heartless jackass and a person who says raping someone is showing  love  aka as i call these  people reblicunts  you also sound like a victim blamer", "That doesn't matter.  Assault is assault.  What you fail to understand is that what that \"poor boy\" did was sexual harassment.  Come on now you can't really be this stupid, can you?", "You just need to give up and accept what a total AH you really are and go beg your daughter for forgivness before you take yourself yout of her life completely.  You don't deserve the title of father with your attitude and if your wife doesn't divorce you and get a judge to bar further contact with your daughter, I frankly think she is a total AH as well.", "As a person of color, and as a woman of color, i know what its like to be vulnerable because of your race. That being said, this is disgusting behavior and you\u2019re not setting the example to your daughter you think you are. I deal with a lot of African men on the daily, they\u2019re just who I work with. They are refugees and very forward. I understand they come from a war torn land in some cases, and while I feel for them, my safety and comfort around others should not me compromised. If I let it happen because I feel bad for them, that enables the behavior. Intentional or not, you\u2019ve basically said to your daughter she should just take it because he has it worse. And by furthering this his from a vulnerable minority and should be excused for this behavior, you dehumanized him. Oh he doesn\u2019t know any better is a condescending take. And I, as marginalized woman hate when people take this tone with me. He not just a refugee, he\u2019s a not just minority, he is a person who made YOUR daughter feel unsafe. And as a person, he should be made accountable.", "Sounds like it.", "Bro literally fuck your self lol Jesus Christ how did the universe conspire to put a young woman under your care.", "I thought this was fake and this confirms it. You\u2019re nothing more than a right wing troll.", "Obviously YTA, but I suspect it\u2019s because you\u2019re a right wing troll making this up, which would admittedly be preferable to teaching your daughter to let people violate her so they don\u2019t get in trouble.", "You sound like a horrible parent go burn in hell with all the other terrible people", "YTA... And, WTF?", "You care more about whether refugees are getting laid than if your daughter is sexually assaulted or harassed? Would you tell your daughter to not report a rape if the perpetrator was a refugee?\n\nThe school investigated and they found that it was sexual harassment, not a cultural miscommunication, why do you think you know better than them?", "Hahahaha\nIt is funny. You say it is normal for refugees to force themselves on women as it is their culture.. So why would any women subject themselves to that?", "Holy shit. Are you serious right now?", "So your daughter should have sex with this kid who makes her uncomfortable because he\u2019s had a bad life? Yikes. Please give up custody to someone who doesn\u2019t see your daughter as existing to please men", "So it's okay to sexually assault unwilling girls?.......", "So your daughter should spread her legs for the guy, is that what you're saying?", "I hope you realise how deranged and revolting your whole attitude is one day, and then have to live with that knowledge for the rest of your life", "It's about CONSENT. That's it. YTA.", "And your daughter should pay for that by allowing herself to be touched against her will?", "At least OP has gone full misogynist mask off, here.\n\nYTA", "Yeah. Because his \u201chealthy sex life\u201d is more important than OP\u2019s daughter feeling safe and having control over her body"]}
