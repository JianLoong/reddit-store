I need a bit more info why is your top and base coat so expensive? It is definitely difficult to see people waste your polish (I had an aunt who ruined my small batch indie polish that can't be replaced) so I get the frustration but I want to understand what's so special about this top and base coat. They usually cost slightly less or as much as nail polish.", "NTA. People have similar policies like not letting people borrow cds/dvds because they've had some returned scratched or not lending books because someone lost one once.  It's not a reflection on the new friend, it's a policy you've set based on past experience and setting boundaries is ok.\n\n*also I saw your comment about holo taco and I've googled them and am on the verge of having a new hobby... the polishes are so pretty!!", "NTA. As someone with a love for indie nailpolish (Femme Fatale and ILNP ftw!), I no longer let people touch my nailpolish because it's an expensive hobby and they will just never understand and appreciate it as much.", "Knowing that my SO spends on that stuff, NTA to say no.  You've helped friends in the past, only to see your $$$ go down the drain when they chip it off.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nYour friends aren't entitled to use anything you own at the end of the day. If you decline and tell them no, It's your polish, and that's that.\n\nBUT, I think there needs to be better communication on your part and a workaround for this issue. Was this the first time any of them were hearing your concerns? This looks like it is happening frequently enough that you just need to voice them and tell your friends you'd appreciate it that if they intend to use your polish, they should try wearing it for an extended period of time. If they continue, then... yeah... that's a bit frustrating.\n\nThere is also a chance some of them really don't know proper application and the polish easily chips off, gets messed up when they leave, or even their body chemistry rejects the polish since they dont use it regularly. I think yall just need to talk more to figure out the main issues and all the little bits in-between.\n\nWith all that, you were a bit of an AH towards the new friend who hasn't worked with nail polish. You declined them a chance because of the past actions of the others. Especially since it sounds like you refused to just teach them. Even a showcase on your own hand for them to see how it is done properly could have been more beneficial. Maybe even look into buying an affordable drugstore all in one top and base coat mix that they can use for moments like this and keeping yours locked up. \n\nI think your friends were taken aback by how stern your no was with the addition of all your grievance with them. Definitely talk with them, clarify what you meant, BUT reaffirm that your words did offend them, and apologize where they feel is appropriate.\n\nRe-evaluate how you wanna share your colors going forward. You may even realize you aren't comfortable letting them use them at all and that's okay. Just get that all out of the way to avoid the confrontation in the future\n\n(Saw you post on simplynaillogical before they deleted it lol! All of this is based on assumption and reading between the lines, so apologies for that. Hopefully this helps)", "NTA:  It's your stuff & you don't have to share. It's literally that easy. Your new friend is insecure.", "I would be a little wary of sharing nail polish with someone who hasn't done a thorough cleaning of their hands and nails.  It's like sharing makeup.\n\nNTA.  Keep your stuff to yourself.", "NTA", "Regardless of what you paid, this just comes off petty af. Maybe not at an AH level but still not cool.", "YTA for just immediately shooting her down and acting like you and your products are too good for her. Your friend didn\u2019t know, and was asking you to teach her and explain, and instead got high and mighty and accused her of something without any basis. \n\nYou easily could have just said something like, \u201csure. Let\u2019s go run out and buy some base coat and top coat for you\u201d and gotten a much less inexpensive version, and introduced a friend to something you claim to be passionate about.", "Well honestly I\u2019m going to say YTA , because you\u2019re the one who felt it necessary to start talking about top and base coats. You obviously are very passionate about nail polish, but your need to express your knowledge bit you in the ass. You honestly just should have kept quiet and let her use the color polish. You basically told her since other people waste the polish she would too, and that\u2019s a bit of a D move.", "YTA. You don't mind if someone picks off the color polish, only the top and base coat. She didn't even want top and base coat. Just the color. You could have either said yes and let her use the color, or said no because you're saving it, but she didn't need a lecture about top and base coats. \n\nThis is all *before* she asked you for the manicure, just as a note.\n\nThen she asked for the manicure, which is kind of a big favor to ask, but it seems like she'd have accepted a no. Instead she got *another* lecture.\n\nSo you implied she was doing something wrong by not using top/base to begin with (lots, lots, LOTS of people just don't!), and then further implied she was going to pick her nails.", "YTA. Why are you punishing a new friend for the habits of other people? \n\nWhy couldn't you graciously explain your previous issues with doing your friends' nails, and then if she chipped them off anyway you'll remember not to do them for her either? If you act stingy about sharing your interests and hobbies with your friends (and one layer of base and top coat), then you won't have many.", "YTA -- you were making the assumption she wouldn't take care of her nails, clearly, which she correctly pointed out is pretty rude. You didn't listen to what she was really saying -- that she wanted to learn from you and that she would be happy with a compromise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
