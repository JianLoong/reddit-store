I went to the eye doctor in January and they told me my optic nerves were swollen and I would have to be transferred to a better doctor to find out more. Since January I\u2019ve had blood work done 3 times along with a MRI and a MRV. All of which came back clear. The last step was to test my spinal fluid in which it came back stating that I had high fluid pressure. I was diagnosed with IIH ( Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension). I admit I was a bit upset, but the doctor had already prepared me for this diagnosis on the second visit and the test just confirmed it. I was talking to my about my condition and she began to laugh and say \u201c omg you\u2019re calling yourself an idiot and a psychopath\u201d. I told her to stop because she was starting to piss me off. She got defensive and said ti was a joke and that I should be able to laugh at it. I honestly don\u2019t find it funny because I\u2019ve been struggling until now with back pain and migraines and I\u2019m just glad there\u2019s medicine that can treat this condition.
