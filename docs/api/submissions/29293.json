Last Friday we were all hanging out and she was pushier than usual, and her boyfriend (my friend) jumped on the bandwagon and was trying to convince me to let her. \n\nI was short and told them no, that I didn't want her to tattoo me and I'd told them my reasons already but they wouldn't budge. Eventually I was snappy and told her that I still haven't seen a single clean line on her instagram page and that I wouldn't ever let her come near me with a needle.

They don't stray from their chosen artist either. \nOnce you have established good communication, etc, with a artist. Why would you gamble on letting someone else do it? \nIf she wants to be a good tattoo artist, she should know all of this. She's been begging for over a year? Yeah, I wouldn't let her near me either, just for that reason alone. \nAnd if she's not that good either. Even bigger reason to say \"no thank you\" yes they need to practice. But people aren't a drawing pad for someone to just scribble on. \n\nTelling someone off is sometimes just the last option left. \nHer boyfriend should know OP well enough to not pester them too just to make the gf happy. \nThen he could be her test subject.

When someone will not stop harassing and won't take no for an answer, there's only so long you can keep up polite. From what OP has said, this does seem to amount to harassment.", "You can turn it around. Would people who see you as a friend pester you about a subject until you a snap for a year? \n\"Hey, we are friends. Just let my GF poke you with a needle even if the result might suck\" \n\nNo. People who see you as a friend would have shut her down on their own. \"Hey, OP said no already. Just let it rest. \" \nNot try and pressure you. \nSo it's one-sided \"protecting the friendship\" if we look at it from the other side. \nIf they already don't respect you enough. You have to put the boundary. If they won't listen when you are being polite. \n\nIt's not just letting her Ink OP. \nShe could potentially ruin someone else's work if OP has a lot of them already, and she don't think about placement. If the ink she uses isn't good, it can cause problems. Getting a tattoo removed or covered up is hell. \nYou can get sick as hell if she doesn't clean her stuff properly. \n\nA no on that subject is a no.\nAnd she wasn't gonna give up until OP says yes."]}
