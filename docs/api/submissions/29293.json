And I think the others would be on your side if you didn't take that hit. Feels like they sided with her.", "ESH. She should not have been nagging you, but insulting her work was not necessary.

Justified assholery.", "You were far too gentle with her, but otherwise NTA.", "NTA, you are not a replaceable or disposable piece of paper. You can't help her advertise by giving her a piece of your skin, they should have already realized that the first no was a no and that maybe, but very probably not, your opinion could change in years.\n\nIf she was the most amazing artist anybody had ever seen then maybe you'd have gone for it, pushing the issue was their mistake if she didn't want to know why you continued to decline.", "JAM- they shouldn't have put you in that position", "NTA Your body your choice.", "NTA but also how does a tattoo artist of any level not understand different people like different styles? She's *seen* your tattoos. \n\nPlus, if she is still very new she should be realistic about her level of competence, before it bites her (and a client) in the arse.", "NTA. No means no, she kept pushing so you pushed back.

Then she resorted to peer pressure after clearly not taking no for an answer. \n\nYou need new friends anyway.", "NTA and I probably wouldn't hang out with her and her boyfriend anymore.

I wouldnt want to be tattooed by someone that pushy either", "NTA. She was being absolutely inappropriate and pushing you to give her access to your body, which you don't owe to ANYONE.

Could have been handled better on both ends, but they backed you into a corner", "NTA\n\nWhat part of no did they not hear. If you badgered her for something and she said no but you wouldn\u2019t stop, I am sure cops would be called for harassment, but when a woman does that to a man, it is alright?  \n\nBoth the woman and your so called friend should just stop when you say no. No means NO!", "NTA As someone with tattoos the main thing you should be considering when you get one is if you like the artist and if you vibe with their style, there\u2019s nothing wrong with not liking a certain artist.

As a human being, no means no! I think in the future you could try to have more conversation, like why does this mean so much to you, why can't you accept my no, etc. You run the risk of losing all your friends when you're brash and curt like that.

There's also the chance that if they break up then you'd be stuck with a reminder of his ex on your body.

You have every right to go to any artist you want without having to explain. Maybe it's better she knows the truth so she can keep on practicing. I am picky with my hair and will only go to my stylist even though I have friends that bug me to use them. I just say I am loyal to my stylist, I trust her, and I don't want it to ruin our friendship if something goes wrong. It's our money and body we can do what we want.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a serious, permanent decision to get a tattoo. I would never let an artist I don't love do anything on me. I've had to wait 8 months to get my black and grey guy, and I waited because it is beautiful art. I could get in to some younger,  less experienced, sooner. But I'm going to wear this forever, and I chose my artist carefully. If she wants to make art for you so much, why not change medium and make a nice framed drawing? It's weird to be so pushy about this, and good people eventually break when their boundaries aren't listened to.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA\n\nNo is a complete sentence. They fucked around, they found out.", "NTA, I had \u201ementors\u201c like that when I just started working at a tattoo studio when I was very young and I hate every single one of those tattoos.

How many times do they expect you to politely decline before making it loud and clear?", "NTA.  I dated a tattoo artist who said one of his rules was that he would never tattoo someone he was in a relationship with.  I imagine that would extend to their close friends.  I'm certain he never would've pestered any of my friends to let him tattoo them.  In addition to needing to learn about consent and how to accept no, she also needs to learn professionalism (and improve her tattooing skills).", "Honestly it would be better that she heard honest criticism (even though it was blunt) and improve on her skills rather than have an unhappy client trash her reputation all over SM while she is starting out. He is pointing out not only that she needs to improve her technique but also how to talk to clients and really listen to what the client is asking for(or in this case listen to what OP DOES NOT WANT)...A crappy reputation  is hard to recover from when starting in a client-based industry NTA", "I like to say don't peer pressure me. That ends the pressure.", "Now I am visualizing her pushing an envelope at him and him picking it up and smacking her over the head repeatedly with it. Wonder if that would help her understand the deifinition of the word \"NO\".  Definately NTA.", "Agreed - OP tho you should check in with someone from the group chat, if you feel up to it maybe ask them to think of some reason to message it so it can start again. It\u2019d be a shame if you inadvertently got distance from your friend group cus of this", "It's not only that, it's that it's an intimate thing- like having a doctor you're comfortable with. Even more important than a hair stylist. Doctor/ nurse,  massage therapist and tattoo artist are pretty much the same level of intimate in different ways.", "I agree with you, another decently tattooed human, but the fact she is so pushy is more than concerning.

You can\u2019t do that on an app.", "OMG YES! Yes to all of this! \n\nI've been going to my guy since I was 18, and I am very much older than that now lol and he had his own shop long before i started going to him so he's an actual artist and knows his shit and how to do it perfectly!", "So much this!!!", "Yeah, if her boyfriend is so supportive why doesn\u2019t he get one of her tattoos lmao", "I agree with you. so i\u2019m sorry for this comment, but from what you quoted OP didn\u2019t say the first (important for ppl who have trouble listening/understanding) part.

I dig it.", "This is why I don\u2019t like when people say they painted something and it was done on an iPad. It\u2019s art but it\u2019s not painting and imo it\u2019s intentionally deceptive to say it is. My daughter is in advanced art classes and works with many different types of paints and materials. It\u2019s all art but requires very different techniques and skills. She spends a lot of time practicing working with the different physical media.", "Again, that's not what I'm talking about. I said, if I hand them a pencil and paper, and they can't recreate what they claim that they \"drew\" on a tablet, then I don't want them tattooing on me.

She had stencils for the bigger aspects then went in with two different colored markers as a stencil for the rest. Maybe it's not super uncommon, but the way she freehanded so much of it is so impressive to me and it still looks amazing. The ability to have a vision in your mind and then just execute it so perfectly. Incredible", "I have the majority of my back done and what I have is something my guy dreamed of and called me like  I have an idea\" lol!\n\nWorked out great!", "ESH\nThe friend and girlfriend for not respecting your boundaries, obviously.\nBut you suck for how you said it. \"I'm sorry, I don't think your style of tattoos matches mine.

I wouldn't let you near me with a needle because I don't like your style? Just be more firm of you only go to this one tattoo artist (which is very valid and very true to a lot of people).

You tried to be polite, but they forced the truth from you.\n\nYour body your choice my friend.\nConsent through coersion isn't consent- this applies to pretty much everything. \n\nTattoos are forever.

Hello right in my backyard", "NTA\n\nYou tried being nice, you said you were happy with the relationship you have with the artist you\u2019ve been using.

You have been very patient and diplomatic enough. They were too pushy and you accidentally snapped because you have reached the limit. It's a natural response.

BUT if I ever walk by a tattoo shop and they say they can \u201cfix\u201d my work, I would absolutely never consider them in a million years.

Perhaps the girl was more trying to build a better relationship with OP by talking about something she thought OP would find interesting or cool (tattoos).
