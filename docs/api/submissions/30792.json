They are a very toxic couple. Constant fighting, verbally abusive, the kids get dragged into their fights. Being asked if they want a new mom?, who do you want to leave, mom or dad? They both have cheated or showed interest in others at one time or another other in their relationship. My brother is verbally abusive, feels entitled, plays the victim and has anger issues. His girlfriend instigates things and acts like her sh!t don\u2019t stink.\nLast Christmas Eve he was arrested for reasons that he could have controlled. I was asked to lend them the money for bail, in which I did so my nieces wouldn\u2019t wake up on Christmas morning with their dad in jail. \n\nAbout 6 months after that, his gf calls me to pick up her the girls because she had to call the cops on my brother. Automatically pissed at my brother, I race there only to be greater by my nieces running to me crying. I had the all the girls stay the weekend to give them space. They went back home and my brother starting sleeping at my house for a few days. Come to find out, his gf called the cops because while my brother was ordering pizza on her phone, she received a secret message from a guy she worked with. They stated fighting, he refused to give the phone back and she called the cops. \n\nFast forward to me. I received an urgent message from my eight year old niece, begging me to call her back because it\u2019s an emergency. She ended up calling me crying that her parents were fighting. Both my nieces were crying and scared and all I can hear in the background is them screaming and yelling. 20 minutes go by with still yelling in the background , I am trying to call my nieces down. My niece then says she thinks she heard her dad just throw a trashcan. At that point decided to call 311 to do a wellness check because unfortunately due to my situation, I was unable to go there. Not too much long after that the police showed up and my call with my niece was disconnected\n.\nNow, I am being portrayed as me trying to attack them. I am blocked on Facebook and will not allow my nieces to come over and spend the night with my daughter.\nThis very much breaks my heart, because I love those girls with all I have. I will do anything for them. But they are treating me like I am the A-hole.\n\nEdited:\nI wanted to add that the girls are not abused. He and his gf are toxic to each other. No physical harm has been done. Therefore no reason they would remove them from the home. Don\u2019t think that I am throwing my hands in the air and giving up. I have my ways of making sure they are okay and ready to do what I have to do when the time comes.

You have done your best to help them.  \n\nIf you are in America you can call CPS, child protective services and open a case, especially if you are willing for the girls to come and live with you.

You need to get your nieces out of that household immediately, or it\u2019s only going to get worse from there.

It doesn't have to be physical or sexual to be abuse.
