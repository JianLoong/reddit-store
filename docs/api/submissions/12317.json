I told Eni that she should return the jokes to Lily, but she can never think of anything to say.\nLast year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like \"Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni\" and she laugh with the children at the party. I was furious and Eni and Tom gave a fake laugh and said that Eni was 4 months pregnant. When we were all congratulating them, Lily said \"wow, at least now you can excuse yourself when people see you eating like a pig.\" I got furious again but Eni asked me to just let it go but I know how much that jokes hurt her.

Tom's mother scolded me for the joke and I asked her why Lily's jokes were funny but mine weren't, if they both had a pig joke in it, and her mother couldn't answer me. I told her that every time I heard Lily tell a joke about Eni, I would return the joke. Eni told me that I shouldn't have done that, but I could see her hold back her laughter along with the other guests, but I'm tired of Eni being walked over.

NTA", "eff that, good for you!! at least its just a joke back, much nicer than what i would have said! NTA!", "Lily is 23, not a child. She knows exactly what she's doing. Nta", "Agreeing with everyone else here that Tom should be sticking up for his wife, and NTA, but instead of returning the jokes, you (we'll see if they continue in front of you, after that) or Eni could look slightly puzzled and say \"I don't get it.\" And any time she responds, keep coming back with, \"I'm sorry could you explain the joke?\" \"But why is it funny?\" Etc etc.", "NTA  but hope this actually helps your sister.    \n\nThe husband is not standing up for your sister neither is  the mil.      \n\nYour sister needs to also stand up for herself.", "No you are not", "NTA. You\u2019re a good big sister. Your sister is trying to be peacekeeper. If she tried defending herself, she\u2019d get the hate. But since you\u2019re not their family, it\u2019s ok if they hate you. And I find it interesting how Lily is able to dish out so much yet at the first time she receives the same treatment, she runs away crying. But seriously, wtf is wrong with your BIL. He\u2019s a shitty husband for not defending his wife.", "Go for it paybacks a bit*h!", "NTA. I love it. Classic \u201ccan dish it out but can\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\nNow that you\u2019ve found something that bothers her I would wear that shit out.  Over-the-top pig laughs every single time.", "NTA.  OMG - your sister's husband/in-laws are awful.  Her husband allows this bullying to continue?  He's major AH.  Sounds like Lily may be hung up on her brother, or at the least feels insecure & bullies to make herself feel better.  The fact that she cried/ran away over your \"joke\" tells you how insecure she is when called out on her behavior.   What is wrong with her inlaws?  \n\nNext time Lily starts to insult anyone, under the guise of a \"joke\" perhaps tell her that she's acting like a donkey's ass.   Just \"hee-haw\" every time.  \n\nIf she cannot stick up for herself, you/your family should have a talk with her husband.  I see this ending badly for your sister - and her future children - hearing these taunts.", "You all suck. Are you a family or a pack of wolves. Husband accepts his wife being mocked. Family all condone it. Two wrongs do not make a right. You fighting fire with fire and insulting Lily has debased you to her level. You all need some therapy and better manners", "Keep returning her jokes with as much salt as possible.  NTA.  At least someone is standing up for your sister since her husband is failing to do so.", "Wait, you\u2019re talking about AN ADULT and not a teenager?? \n\nNTA.", "You are nta and generally speaking a 27 yr old and a 23 yr old both know how to behave properly.", "NTA but her husband sure is. Who lets this happen to their spouse and sits there and says / does nothing? He should have addressed this from day 1. What is wrong with him?", "Nope some people need a humbling experience & put in their place..she got hers", "NTA. Protect your sister. Hubby needs to step up, but he may have previously been the object of Lily's bullying and may have trouble standing up for himself. Still he needs to step up. Especially with a baby coming. Will he let his kid be bullied? Continue standing up for your sister and nibling when he/she comes. Sometimes bullies don't learn until they feel the pain themselves.", "NTA. Also, thank you for being the kind of sister I wish I had, mine is the Lily type.", "Isn't it always funny when bullies get literally 1 reply, 1 single clap back, and they run screaming for the hills. The fragility of bullies is often extremely real, and very much right at the surface. NTA. That family sounds atrocious and Eni sounds like she's just learned to be the dumping ground for everyone. Her husband sounds like a total people-pleasing coward (well, people other than his WIFE, for some reason.)", "NTA. \n\nBullies always hate it when the get as good as they give.", "You are definitely NTA, however Tom and his family certainly are. Your sister has major problems primarily with her husband and secondarily with the MIL and SIL. Tom should have been shutting his family down and standing up for his wife since the beginning! Not doing so has enabled the bullies to normalize their behavior, thus their shock at your backlash. Unfortunately, this isn't your battle to fight, your sister is going to have to take charge and move for change and counseling, or take other steps, prior to bringing the baby into this situation.", "[removed]", "NTA. Why is your sister married to someone who allowed this to persist?! What does he think will happen when his child grows up to be imperfect in some minuscule way?! What a horrid family.", "NTA. Eni is being abused and her husbands compliance is a huge red flag.", "NTA.

It\u2019s really disheartening that her own husband doesn\u2019t have the, ahem appendages, to stand up to his mother and sister in Eni\u2019s defense. Because it really should be him dealing with Lily and not you. And I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t, because you absolutely should. But it\u2019s his responsibility as it\u2019s his family members. I also think it\u2019s bullshit that his mother pulled the \u201cyou\u2019re older, so you should act like it\u201d card. Lily isn\u2019t a child. She\u2019s an adult and if she can\u2019t act like one, that\u2019s not yours or Eni\u2019s fault. I really despise bully\u2019s who are mean under the guise of being funny. Lily shouldn\u2019t dish it out if she can\u2019t take it. Which she very clearly cannot.", "No you\u2019re NTA. So the bully got called out. About time I say.", "As a younger sister, I can tell you you\u2019re an AWESOME big sis! Well done and NTA.", "NTA Lily needs to get that she's being rude and hurtful.

I'm fangirling over here!!!!", "NTA. You asked BIL and MIL multiple times  to ask SIL to stop and they didn\u2019t so you took matters into your own hands.

And do not let your foot off the gas ! Do not let up !
