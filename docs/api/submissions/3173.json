If she has been in your life and raising you since you were 2 years old (although the child's age and how long shouldn't matter because if someone is to become a step-parent they should be ready and capable of loving their step children equally or enough to treat them the same as their biological kids) I would truly hope she is able to see past the biological aspect of it. Hell, I was adopted as an infant and also have a step-dad and I've never been treated as anything other than their own.

It seems like a lot of these comments are coming from perpetually angry people with poor reading comprehension when it really doesn\u2019t hurt to be kind to people. \n\nYou are not at fault. You are being treated unfairly. You have resources so you will be better off mentally to leave this unfair treatment behind. Build your own life and family and don\u2019t look back. Part of you will want to be treated with love and consideration by these people, (because, who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s a very normal desire) but you need to work on accepting that this won\u2019t happen, for your own mental well-being.

I called my parents to talk to them about it and they told me I can move back in with them. I was still with the father of my child during all this he even moved in with me our break up happened later and was because he became verbally abusive. I have only lived in my parents house for a year. I rent a space in my parents home it\u2019s like subletting apartments.
