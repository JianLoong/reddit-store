I think everyone ESH, I\u2019m assuming that your parents never sat you down and have a conversation about expectations when you moved back in. They should have had a talk with prior to moving in. When I was 30 years old I had to move back home with my parents, my parents went over expectations, what they willing to do. I personally believe a discussion should have had.

It\u2019s just they kicked us out knowing we don\u2019t have much since I do pay for myself and my daughter in day to day life (daycare, health care, car insurance, food, rent in my parents house, car payment) so it\u2019s just so much on my mental health.", "Where does anything say she isnt?

Ones that assume I do nothing and expect my parents to take care of me and my child. I have a job. I have a car. I have car insurance. I have a car payment. I pay for daycare. I pay for health insurance. I don\u2019t think my child is an important detail, mainly because she\u2019s only 1 and I haven\u2019t been invited on a single vacation since I graduated high school. It\u2019s not like my parents don\u2019t invite my other adult siblings on vacation the one who graduated college doesn\u2019t even live in the home anymore and he has been constantly invited on trips with my family. I don\u2019t blame my siblings it\u2019s not their fault I\u2019m just upset that I\u2019m not invited it has absolutely nothing I repeat ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with cost. If I can\u2019t afford to pay mine and my child\u2019s way on vacation then that\u2019s my problem and I should manage my money better this is the fact that I don\u2019t even mean enough to be thought of or told I find out the day of or a week before that doesn\u2019t give me enough time to take off work and save money to go on said trips. I just wanna be included.", "Years? I moved out when I was 19 and moved back in when I was 22 I\u2019ve lived with them for a year. I pay for everything I and my child needs.

I never expected  anything for free.", "So just because I didn\u2019t mention having a job means I don\u2019t have one? I never mentioned my parents providing child care but you assumed they did. I don\u2019t live in my parents house for free. I pay for rent, I pay for daycare, I pay for my own food, my own car, my own health insurance, my own car insurance. I pay for everything for myself. I would of even paid for any vacation they invited me on.

My daughter is one years old. I had her in 2021 I moved in with my parents during the pandemic because of hard times. I do not leach off my parents. I pay rent and buy groceries. I never expected them to pay for the vaccinations for me and my child. I was more worried about why I wasn\u2019t invited when my other adult siblings were.

Did she say she was asking them to fund her way into the trip? No. Did she say she wasn't paying her fair share in the house? Also no.

Just food for thought.", "You are the neighbour? or family so you know everything hahah funny ppl .", "How? She pays rent,her bills and for her own groceries", "What exactly from the post or comments is saying that she isn't? I mean i see that she moved out at 19, landlord kicked her out while pregnant, moved in with parents, had baby, broke up with bf, got new bf, parents ask her to move out. She never said she doesnt have a job, childcare lined up, she even says she pays rent and for food. Am i missing something?", "Where does it say that she's not parenting? She pays rent and for everything she and her child need including daycare so parents aren't being used for child care. Op states her parents were angry when she moved out at 19 and are punishing her for \"abandoning\" the family. Op needs to move out and ghost them, no one needs that toxic shit", "Legit these people are making their own facts at this point smh."]}
