If I can\u2019t afford to pay mine and my child\u2019s way on vacation then that\u2019s my problem and I should manage my money better this is the fact that I don\u2019t even mean enough to be thought of or told I find out the day of or a week before that doesn\u2019t give me enough time to take off work and save money to go on said trips.

You were asked to move out so that's just what you are going to do. I wouldn't worry about when you do it, unless they expect you to move out sooner than the trip takes place. Either way, I'm sorry your family chooses to exclude you. Unfortunately, they'll probably end up regretting the way they have treated you.
