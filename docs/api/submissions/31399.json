If he can't give you an answer on what could be improved, then I think full marks are deserved.\n\nCalling you a spoiled brat is also grossly inappropriate for a teacher imo, I'd be talking to the principal/senior staff of the school if I was you.", "INFO\n\nNo real context here: What level of schooling? Was the test out of 96 points? Was the 96 a percentage?\n\nHow does your teacher grade? There are two basic philosophies to think about grading. In one, the student starts with 100/100 and points are deducted for errors. In the other the student starts at 0/100, and earns points though correctness and completeness of answers. If your teacher takes the second approach, you don't have to get anything wrong to not get 100%, it can be an issue of answers that are correct but lack some detail.\n\nWas there any indication where you didn't get full points?\n\n>after more of this he got up and screamed that i was being a spoiled brat. aita?\n\nThis is unacceptable. You should talk with a trusted adult at your school if possible.", "NTA. May want to let your parents handle this situation with the principal. Also make sure the fact that they screamed at you is documented.", "NTA\n\nYour teacher gave you subjective scoring on a test that has no wrong answer.  I don't know what issue he was with you but it is definitely wrong on the teacher's part and you should not let him get away because if he did this to you who knows how many times he did to other students.\n\nDefinitely talk to your parent to raise the issue with higher-ups at school.  Your teacher better have good answer of his obstinance to not grant you 100.", "NTA.

If he can't justify the deduction he needs to give you the grade you earned.  \n\nI had this in college and it ended up the difference between a scholarship to cover my full tuition and one that covered less than half my tuition.  I appealed and the academic council ruled in my favor.  I know this isn't as big of a deal, but that's why it's good practice.  Get used to standing up for yourself.

I'm a teacher and this is really odd.  If you didn't have anything wrong, why a 96?  A perfect grade is 100.  Honestly, I'd consider going forward by telling your parents or principal.  This is unfair.", "NTA he at least could have told you what you could do to get 100?", "Was it a multiple choice or fill in the blank type test or a short/long answer test? Because if it\u2019s the latter, you may not have had sufficient information for one of the answers to get full marks.

Not saying it was an appropriate reaction, but curious why the teacher would say (yell) that.", "NTA!  Depending on your age, get your parents and principal involved; or, get your dean involved...maybe your parents, too.\n\nThis is the type of asshole if he were a manager, he would never give you a solidly excellent job review but instead would tell you \"there's always room for improvement\", or some other gaslighting bullshit like that.\n\nGet ready, kid!

If so then N.T.A. but if it was a written exam, which seems likely if it was history, then YWBTA because there are all kinds of reasons that you deduct points in an analytical subject. From your perspective you got nothing wrong, from your teachers maybe you had some poorly worded grammar, maybe you didn't explain yourself as thoroughly as you could. 96 is still an A grade.\n\nTeacher shouldn't have yelled but if you were coming across as an entitled brat over four points I kind of get where they would be coming from as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We were clapping that they are right and professor was wrong.\n\nAs for you, you did get nothing wrong but doesn't mean that its all right either.  History is not maths where you have a definite right/wrong.  There is always a scale.\n\nI suggest you may want to ask the question what will make it 100.
