Treatment would be aggressive so I was to start short term disability ASAP. \n\nI was an Emergency Medical Dispatcher for 10 years. My fianc\u00e9 worked on the ambulance for years and had already put in a transfer request to dispatch. With the understanding he absolutely required days to care for me at night it was approved. \n\nOur chain of command is S and then the manager L. S and I have been very close for nearly ten years, she was even present when I was diagnosed and knew what was coming. She also loved working with my husband and was our maid of honor.\n\nOut of nowhere S and L say they\u2019re moving him \u201ctemporarily\u201d to nights, meaning it could be months. I told S this wouldn\u2019t work, we had said he required day shift. But instead the other new hire was given the day slot so they could work directly with their girlfriend. Favoritism is pretty blatant here. \n\nHis first night shift I had a fall from weakness, prompting my elderly mother to stay during his shifts. At this point I was getting no where with S and L was out indefinitely due to a personal emergency. I told S there were unethical practices happening and if I was forced to go all the way to the VP to ask him why then I would but I didn\u2019t want to. Just to be clear, I was literally never once disrespectful to her and I was probably way more transparent than I should\u2019ve been because she was an old friend. She then told me she\u2019d no longer talk about work with me as it \u201cjeopardized\u201d her job. \n\nWith no supervisor we were forced to go to HR. S tried lying saying I said night shift would be fine. So I had to draw up a very detailed timeline and include emails, screenshots of texts, etc., just to prove our side. We also submitted FMLA and ADA paperwork. HR called stating he\u2019ll be moved to days within a week. I\u2019ve never heard them sound that nervous in all my time there. Clearly somebody screwed up big time and got caught. \n\nNo idea to what extent but obviously S got in trouble and completely ghosted me. She refuses to even speak to or look at my husband in the office. I told her I was going to expose whatever unethical practices were happening, I just naively didn\u2019t think she was a part of it. But I think she thought we wouldn\u2019t push the issue because he and I are both very laid back people generally speaking. \n\nI never wanted her job to get screwed up in this process. But I also feel like if she got caught she should be held accountable, she\u2019s causing harm to people. I just feel bad because I had to put everyone on blast to HR to prove what he and I were saying was true and I\u2019m sure she felt betrayed.", "created_utc": 1671205107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znhhll/aita_for_getting_my_friendsupervisor_in_trouble/", "score": 502, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't do this to her. She did this to herself. You requested reasonable accommodations. You and your husband followed the rules. S did not. Simple as that. Don't lay down and take disrespect under the auspice of friendship. You did the right thing. Count yourselves lucky to be free of a false friend and dishonest person. \n\nI hope for a full and expedient recovery for you. Ignore all this nonsense. Focus your energy on getting strong. I sincerely hope for the best for you.", "Have you ever heard the term \u201cfair-weather friend?\u201d That is what S has shown herself to be. Practices like FMLA and ADA accommodations exist for a reason, and she ducked up, big-time. HR was nervous bc there\u2019s a lot of fines for businesses that don\u2019t follow the rules she clearly ignored. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry to hear about your diagnosis, and I wish you well with your treatment.

A new hire got what they asked when you have seniority. That's not right. And they asked so they. Could work/ hang out with partner. \n\nYou are asking because it's a need. Not by choice.", "NTA, whatever was happening behind the scenes could have been putting your LIFE at risk. And she knew that. She was *there*for your diagnosis. And she straight up lied to HR.
